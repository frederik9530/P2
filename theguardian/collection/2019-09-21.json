Swift\u2019s Melbourne Cup booking was strongly criticised by animal rights groups, who called on Swift to boycott the racing event at which six horses have died since 2013.

We have got to stop messing around.\u201d</p> <p>At the same event Starmer insisted that he would back Remain because \u201cit\u2019s about what sort of country you want to be\u201d, while Lewis accused Corbyn of trying to use union block votes to stifle the views of the mass membership which had propelled him to the leadership in the first place. Their defiance came as news emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/remain-mps-accuse-jeremy-corbyn-shutting-down-brexit-debate\">Labour\u2019s head of policy, Andrew Fisher, a key Corbyn aide who masterminded the 2017 election campaign, had resigned</a>, reportedly telling colleagues he did not believe the party could win a general election. In a memo to colleagues, Fisher is said to have accused Corbyn\u2019s team of a \u201clack of professionalism, competence and human decency\u201d.</p> <p>A leading leftwing activist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-chessum\" title=\"\">Michael Chessum</a>, who has coordinated local party efforts to push a pro-Remain motion through conference, told the <em>Observer</em> that patience among delegates was running out as the leadership appeared intent on defying ordinary members and imposing central control. \u201cThere is a really surreal edge to the atmosphere, partly exacerbated by attempts to delete Tom Watson \u2013 but also on Brexit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a party that wants Remain, voters overwhelmingly wanting clarity, MPs that want Remain and a front bench that wants Remain \u2013 and yet a ludicrous insistence that the party machine might not back them.\u201d</p> <p>The conference is now heading for a series of flashpoint moments. On Sunday there will be key discussions on what Brexit motion goes forward for debate and a vote on the conference floor on Monday. Then on Tuesday Watson is planning to make his own call for unity in his deputy leader\u2019s speech, before Corbyn\u2019s keynote address on Wednesday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b2602992e08bc7109c44edce281eaa924b3de02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b2602992e08bc7109c44edce281eaa924b3de02/0_122_4074_2444/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, has criticised Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit stance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latest Opinium/<em>Observer</em> poll today shows that Labour (on 22%) has now fallen 15 points behind the Tories (on 37%) despite Boris Johnson\u2019s turbulent start, while the hardline pro-Remain Liberal Democrats are on 17% and the Brexit party on 12%.</p> <p>Alarmingly for Labour, 58% of those polled now think the Tories have a clear policy on Brexit, against just 31% of voters who say Labour\u2019s approach is clear. The poll also shows for the first time that as many Remain voters (33%) now plan to vote for the Liberal Democrats as for Labour. In April the proportion planning to vote Labour was nearer 50%, with only around 10% saying they would choose the Lib Dems.</p> <p>Yesterday\u2019s ructions over Brexit broke out after it emerged that Corbyn had tabled a statement to the NEC saying that, while the party backed a referendum and would offer the options of a credible Brexit deal or Remain to voters, a decision on how it would campaign in a second public vote would be left until after a general election.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn was struggling to contain an open revolt by some of his most senior shadow ministers, MPs and party activists last night as anger over his refusal to back a policy of remaining in the EU threatened to wreck the Labour conference. With delegates already reeling from a failed attempt by Corbyn supporters to oust Tom Watson and abolish his role as deputy leader, anger erupted amid accusations that the leadership was trying to block democratic debate and fudge a decision about where Labour stands on the issue of leaving the EU. What was supposed to be a conference to showcase a party united behind new policies on education and health before a likely general election instead opened amid bitterness and acrimony, with a defiant Watson still in place, and Emily Thornberry, Keir Starmer and Clive Lewis, the shadow foreign secretary, Brexit secretary and Treasury minister, publicly defying Corbyn by backing Remain. Leading a march through the streets of Brighton in favour of a people\u2019s vote yesterday, hours after Corbyn had tabled a motion to the national executive committee (NEC) in favour of delaying a decision on whether to back Remain or Leave, Thornberry said: \u201cWe have got to campaign to remain. We have got to stop messing around.\u201d At the same event Starmer insisted that he would back Remain because \u201cit\u2019s about what sort of country you want to be\u201d, while Lewis accused Corbyn of trying to use union block votes to stifle the views of the mass membership which had propelled him to the leadership in the first place. Their defiance came as news emerged that Labour\u2019s head of policy, Andrew Fisher, a key Corbyn aide who masterminded the 2017 election campaign, had resigned, reportedly telling colleagues he did not believe the party could win a general election. In a memo to colleagues, Fisher is said to have accused Corbyn\u2019s team of a \u201clack of professionalism, competence and human decency\u201d. A leading leftwing activist, Michael Chessum, who has coordinated local party efforts to push a pro-Remain motion through conference, told the Observer that patience among delegates was running out as the leadership appeared intent on defying ordinary members and imposing central control. \u201cThere is a really surreal edge to the atmosphere, partly exacerbated by attempts to delete Tom Watson \u2013 but also on Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a party that wants Remain, voters overwhelmingly wanting clarity, MPs that want Remain and a front bench that wants Remain \u2013 and yet a ludicrous insistence that the party machine might not back them.\u201d The conference is now heading for a series of flashpoint moments. On Sunday there will be key discussions on what Brexit motion goes forward for debate and a vote on the conference floor on Monday. Then on Tuesday Watson is planning to make his own call for unity in his deputy leader\u2019s speech, before Corbyn\u2019s keynote address on Wednesday. The latest Opinium/Observer poll today shows that Labour (on 22%) has now fallen 15 points behind the Tories (on 37%) despite Boris Johnson\u2019s turbulent start, while the hardline pro-Remain Liberal Democrats are on 17% and the Brexit party on 12%. Alarmingly for Labour, 58% of those polled now think the Tories have a clear policy on Brexit, against just 31% of voters who say Labour\u2019s approach is clear. The poll also shows for the first time that as many Remain voters (33%) now plan to vote for the Liberal Democrats as for Labour. In April the proportion planning to vote Labour was nearer 50%, with only around 10% saying they would choose the Lib Dems. Yesterday\u2019s ructions over Brexit broke out after it emerged that Corbyn had tabled a statement to the NEC saying that, while the party backed a referendum and would offer the options of a credible Brexit deal or Remain to voters, a decision on how it would campaign in a second public vote would be left until after a general election. Pro-Remain activists and senior party figures who have campaigned for months to shift policy were outraged. They saw the move as an attempt to kill off debate and block a conference vote on their own pro-Remain motion. Last night, however, the leader\u2019s office appeared to back off. It told delegates that the pro-Remain motion would not be superseded by the NEC statement, and would still be debated. It now appears that two competing votes \u2013 one on the NEC statement, and the other explicitly backing Remain \u2013 could be debated and voted on on Tuesday. Asked yesterday if he had known about the plan to oust Watson, put forward to the NEC on Friday by Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum, Corbyn swerved the question. Then after an outcry, and protests from senior figures including the former party leaders Tony Blair and Ed Miliband, Corbyn said that the plan would not proceed and would be replaced by a review into the role of the deputy leader. Watson, who is understood to think Corbyn was fully aware, described the attempt to oust him as a \u201cdrive-by shooting\u201d, adding in a BBC interview: \u201cI got a text message in a Chinese restaurant in Manchester to say that they were abolishing me. It\u2019s a straight sectarian attack on a broad-church party and it\u2019s moving us into a different kind of institution where pluralism isn\u2019t tolerated, where factional observance has to be adhered to completely and it kind of completely goes against the sort of traditions that the Labour party has had for 100 years.\u201d",

That stat seems surprising given that Klopp\u2019s side lost only once last season and finished just a point behind City, though not only is Pep Guardiola\u2019s away record against top sides much better, Roy Hodgson and Crystal Palace have won at both Manchester clubs and Arsenal in the past 12 months.</p> \n<p>Klopp knows that drawing too often cost Liverpool in the league last season.

You cannot always go for the win because if you open up in the last 20 minutes you give the other team a chance.

      "bodyText": "The last time Liverpool won at Stamford Bridge, Antonio Conte was in charge and Chelsea were on their way to the 2016-17 title. Although J\u00fcrgen Klopp only celebrates his fourth anniversary at Anfield next month, Frank Lampard will be the fourth Chelsea manager he has encountered, and though Liverpool are the side with a lead at the top of the Premier League table, they are under more pressure to perform on Sunday afternoon than a carefree young home side just beginning to produce the football supporters want to see. One of the side effects of Liverpool and Manchester City slugging it out for the major prize this season is that rookie managers such as Lampard and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r have something of a free hit. No one sees Chelsea or Manchester United as potential Premier League winners yet. Both clubs can, to an extent, concentrate on restoring the feelgood factor after some testing times under previous managers while taking advantage of the recognition that below the top two, the Champions League places appear to be attainable. Liverpool are obliged to look at things differently, partly because they expect another season of intense competition from City, and partly due to the knowledge that away form is an area that needs improving. In the two seasons since Chelsea won their last title, Liverpool have recorded only a single away win against top-six opposition in the league, against Tottenham a year ago. That stat seems surprising given that Klopp\u2019s side lost only once last season and finished just a point behind City, though not only is Pep Guardiola\u2019s away record against top sides much better, Roy Hodgson and Crystal Palace have won at both Manchester clubs and Arsenal in the past 12 months. Klopp knows that drawing too often cost Liverpool in the league last season. Yet he also finds it difficult to accept that a point against a good side away from home can be regarded as anything other than a positive result. \u201cLast season when we drew at Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United, they were positive results,\u201d the Liverpool manager explains. \u201cIf we had tried to win some of those games we would have lost. You have to make sure you stay in the game first and foremost, then if the chance to win comes along you can try and take it. \u201cWe should have won at Arsenal last season because of the chances we created and that would have been enough, but we cannot change anything now. You cannot always go for the win because if you open up in the last 20 minutes you give the other team a chance. Sometimes you can lose by going for a win, so you have to be sensible and solid and do the right things at the right moment. Your offensive actions have to be protected. \u201cA draw against a rival team will always be a decent result away from home, but at the same time you have to be looking for the moment in the game when it makes sense to go for it. If it is 1-1 late in a game we don\u2019t take the ball into the corner, but we don\u2019t go nuts either.\u201d That traditional philosophy would have served Liverpool well last season but for City\u2019s remarkable tenacity in the run-in. That the defending champions have already allowed Liverpool to open a five-point gap going into this weekend prompted Guardiola to jokingly award the title to Liverpool after last Saturday\u2019s defeat at Norwich, though Klopp does not feel this season will necessarily follow the pattern of the last campaign. \u201cWe only lost one game last season but I\u2019m pretty sure that will not be the case this year,\u201d he says. \u201cThere will be no team who will lose just once, I would say that is unlikely, and after five games the league is definitely not won already. \u201cWe have made a good start, that\u2019s all, but so far nothing has really happened, we have not even created a basis. We have already seen that the league is much different this year. There is not a team who you think will go down with no points. Watford are bottom but performance-wise could be several points better off, and although Wolves are struggling a bit at the moment I think they will end up going back up there.\u201d Simply by virtue of being away from home, Sunday\u2019s fixture is Liverpool\u2019s biggest challenge of the campaign so far, on the domestic front at least, and it should also test the theory that last season\u2019s top two will simply continue to engage in a private battle for the title. That Liverpool can be beaten was amply demonstrated by Napoli in midweek, when Klopp admits his policy of attempting to secure a goalless draw in the Champions League was exposed by the Italians\u2019 persistence. \u201cThe performance was good enough to get a point and it was much better than last year against a really strong side,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cannot say the result was bad \u2013 we\u2019ve got to look at it as an improvement. If they had not got a penalty it would probably have been 0-0 and we would have been fine with that. If you don\u2019t win, you want a point. We ended up with nothing, but that can happen. \u201cThe performance was good so it\u2019s not the moment to say we have to respond because we were so bad. We were playing a good team and we controlled a lot of the game, we just weren\u2019t as dominant as we would have liked to be in the final third.\u201d",

The second half changed because they needed to push more, to attack more, to go against us.\u201d</p> <p>Arsenal nonetheless failed to heed the warning last Sunday but their approach in Frankfurt was noticeably different, the second\u2011choice goalkeeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez showing no reluctance to clear the ball long against opponents who left sizeable gaps at the back.</p> <p>\u201cTo build up with the goalkeeper and centre\u2011back is going to be our identity but we are going to share [that] sometimes with long balls,\u201d Emery said. \u201cFor example, against Frankfurt we were different and decided more times to play a long ball, earn metres on the pitch and after that attack the space.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201c[Frankfurt] were very offensive, with a lot of players in the attacking third for pressing or to attack our space, and we needed to break that press. We did a lot with the long ball, because a lot of the time we had three against three in the attacking third. We decided, and we played with that gameplan.\u201d</p> <p>He said their approach against Villa would depend on the best way to overcome Dean Smith\u2019s team and there are other issues to consider, too.

      "bodyText": "Unai Emery has accepted the blame for any mistakes Arsenal make while playing out from the back and says he is open to a more flexible approach when the situation demands. Arsenal will seek to end a run of three Premier League games without victory when Aston Villa visit the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, a statistic that hangs over them because of a disastrous second-half showing at Watford last weekend. They were 2-0 up before mistakes took hold and much of the debate afterwards surrounded the frequent losses of possession from their own goal-kicks, notably the disastrous pass from Sokratis Papastathopoulos that allowed Tom Cleverley to halve the deficit. Emery said his players were acting on instructions. \u201cOne mistake is not his mistake,\u201d he said when asked if Papastathopoulos, who was left out of the squad that beat Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 in the Europa League, needed a pick\u2011me-up after his error. \u201cIt is the mistake of all the team, and I am responsible because I decided to start like that.\u201d Emery described the Watford game as \u201cmaybe the worst in our buildup starting with the goalkeeper\u201d and appeared to acknowledge that he and his team had not adapted to a change of tactics from the home side after half-time. \u201cIn the first 45 minutes they didn\u2019t push a lot or do a really big press against us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe controlled the match with the ball, the possession, the buildup, easier in the first half. The second half changed because they needed to push more, to attack more, to go against us.\u201d Arsenal nonetheless failed to heed the warning last Sunday but their approach in Frankfurt was noticeably different, the second\u2011choice goalkeeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez showing no reluctance to clear the ball long against opponents who left sizeable gaps at the back. \u201cTo build up with the goalkeeper and centre\u2011back is going to be our identity but we are going to share [that] sometimes with long balls,\u201d Emery said. \u201cFor example, against Frankfurt we were different and decided more times to play a long ball, earn metres on the pitch and after that attack the space. \u201c[Frankfurt] were very offensive, with a lot of players in the attacking third for pressing or to attack our space, and we needed to break that press. We did a lot with the long ball, because a lot of the time we had three against three in the attacking third. We decided, and we played with that gameplan.\u201d He said their approach against Villa would depend on the best way to overcome Dean Smith\u2019s team and there are other issues to consider, too. If Mesut \u00d6zil was, as Emery said on Wednesday, rested from the Frankfurt game in order to keep him fresh then presumably the playmaker has a high chance of returning to the side. There may also be some temptation to test Bukayo Saka against top-flight opponents but Emery suggested Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 will make his fourth start. The club record signing has flickered so far; Emery and his staff are putting in extra work to integrate the \u00a372m forward more quickly. \u201cHe is playing well, but progressively we know there is going to be more performance in him to help us,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I want to do quickly [his] last step in the adaptation for us, for example against Aston Villa. After training we are watching individual videos with him to push him to achieve the tactical details we need for him.

They crept into quarter-finals by winning three out of their last four group games, with the other a tie, and then beat runaway North Group winners Lancashire in their quarter-final at Durham when the game was going the way of the Lightning.<br></p> <p>You hear players and coaches talking about how momentum is so crucial in this format of the game. Well, the Eagles have it. It would be one heck of a six days for Anthony McGrath\u2019s side given they are top of the County Championship by 12 points from Somerset with a round to go. They travel to Taunton on Monday.</p> <p>I will be splitting blogging duties with Tim de Lisle today, who takes over halfway through the second semi-final. The final begins at 6.45pm. Enjoy the day.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-21T10:16:19.262Z\">at 11.16am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "It had to go to the last ball, didn\u2019t it? Two cliffhangers today. One in the World Cup final \u2013 in fact two, because one tie was instantly followed by another. And the greatest run-chase in England\u2019s history. All in the same summer. What a game this is, and what a year we\u2019ve had. Ravi Bopara managed the chase like Ben Stokes. Simon Harmer captained his team like Eoin Morgan. And so did Moeen Ali, the only protagonist in today\u2019s dramas who also played in the World Cup final. Moeen goes down as the most distinguished loser since Kane Williamson. To Essex, the Vitality Blast, at last; to Harmer and Bopara, the spoils; to Moeen, all the feels. Thanks for your company, for supporting The Guardian, and for following this fabulous sport. Who needs The Hundred? Parnell bowled full, outside off, with everyone in the ring saving one, and Harmer squeezed a square drive past the man at point. What a finish. What a moment for Simon Harmer, who added 18 off seven balls to his seven wickets in the two games \u2013 the best bowling ever on Finals Day. Ravi Bopara, too, was phenomenal, stroking 36 off 22 when the heat was on. Worcestershire, who won this trophy last year, would have been worthy winners again \u2013 especially Moeen, who was immense in both matches. But the force was with Harmer. Harmer does it!!! 19.5 overs: Essex 144-6 (Bopara 36, Harmer 10) Five needed off two, and Harmer whacks another straight four! So it\u2019s one off one. Worcs defended that earlier... Mid-20th over: Essex 138-6 (Bopara 36, Harmer 8) It\u2019s Parnell to bowl the last over. A single for Harmer, a single for Bopara, two for Harmer. They need seven off three to win with a tie. Got that? 19th over: Essex 134-6 (Bopara 35, Harmer 5) In comes Simon Harmer, inevitably, and he belts a slower ball back past Brown for four. So it\u2019s down to the last over, and 12 are needed. If it\u2019s a tie, the tie-breaker is wickets lost, which favours Essex unless this over goes for 11 runs and three wickets. Deep breath. Pat Brown \u2013 what a bowler he is. After being thumped for four by Walter, he responds with a fearless knuckle ball and gets his reward. 18th over: Essex 123-5 (Bopara 34, Walter 9) Parnell starts with a wide but recovers well, conceding only singles \u2013 until Bopara, twitching visibly, steals two into no-man\u2019s-land. The crowd sing Hey Jude, and maybe the Worcester fans are happier now... It\u2019s 23 needed off 12. 17th over: Essex 116-5 (Bopara 30, Walter 7) Brown comes on for what Nasser calls the battle of the finishers. Bopara wins this round, waiting for a slower ball and pulling it for a flat six. He has four boundaries already, off 17 balls, while his team-mates have seven between them, off 85. Sweet Caroline rings out, and Bumble can\u2019t resist joining in. His voice is better than his microphone technique. 16th over: Essex 107-5 (Bopara 22, Walter 7) It\u2019s Moeen\u2019s last over. See off or tee off? Bopara\u2019s not one to die wondering, so he slaps a full one over long-off. Moeen finishes with 4-0-22-0, fine figures, but not match-winning ones yet. Essex need 39 from 24 balls. 15th over: Essex 97-5 (Bopara 14, Walter 2) Back comes Barnard, and Bopara edges him \u2013 for four. That wasn\u2019t what Bopara intended, but it was just what he needed. He celebrates with a cover-drive so crisp that it goes straight through Moeen at short extra. That brings the rate required below 10. 14th over: Essex 86-5 (Bopara 6, Walter 2) Another wicket for Moeen, who has 2-12 off three overs. This is like watching the Under-11s: the captains have to do it all themselves. \u201cHow are ye, Tim?\u201d Very well, thanks, Alistair Verdon. \u201cMoeen Ali is the best Blast captain known to man and should bat 4 for England. Enjoy the game.\u201d In Tests? Lawrence dances down the track, lifts Moeen into the night sky \u2013 and doesn\u2019t get quite enough on it, so Wessels takes a fine catch at long-on. Worcs ARE doing it again, unless Bopara has something special up his sleeve. 12th over: Essex 82-4 (Lawrence 23, Bopara 4) \u201cJust a period of calm,\u201d says Mike Atherton, \u201cas Bopara looks to play himself in.\u201d Six singles off Pat Brown\u2019s over. The crowd amuse themselves by making day-oh noises, as if watching Queen at Wembley. 11th over: Essex 76-4 (Lawrence 20, Bopara 1) Moeen finally turns back to himself, perhaps because he\u2019s fed up with trying to remember how many overs everyone else has bowled, and he does the trick. At breakfast, ten Doeschate seemed such a central figure, but he\u2019s flopped in both games. It feels like Bopara or bust. Moeen strikes! ten Doeschate whips to leg and can\u2019t keep it down, giving midwicket a sharp catch. The tide says Worcestershire are doing it again. 10th over: Essex 69-3 (Lawrence 15, ten Doeschate 0) So Essex reach halfway with wickets intact, but 13 behind where Worcs were at the same stage. Not any more! The return of Parnell induces a top-edged pull, and Brown does well to hold on to it after dashing in and almost sliding past the ball. End of a fine, elegant innings from Westley, forgotten by England but still cherished in Essex. 9th over: Essex 63-2 (Westley 35, Lawrence 11) A second successive over for Mitchell too, and it goes for only four, which is half the required rate. But Westley is still there, the rich man\u2019s Wessels. 9th over: Essex 59-2 (Westley 33, Lawrence 9) Mo lets a bowler have two overs in a row! It\u2019s D\u2019Oliveira, and they may regret it when Lawrence gives him the charge and gets just enough on a straight drive to evade the fingertips of the leaping figure at long-off. Ten off the over: Essex need 87 off 11. 8th over: Essex 49-2 (Westley 30, Lawrence 1) If you make enough bowling changes, one of them will work, and so it was with the introduction of Daryl Mitchell\u2019s wily sub-medium. Just when the game was threatening to nod off, Adam Wheater misses a reverse sweep. 7th over: Essex 41-1 (Westley 30, Wheater 9) Yet another bowling change, as D\u2019Oliveira comes on with his allsorts. Is Moeen planning to give ten bowlers two overs each? 6th over: Essex 36-1 (Westley 27, Wheater 7) Moeen brings on his fifth bowler in six overs, Ed Barnard of England Lions. He squeezes an edge out of Westley, but it loops just to the left of the man at backward point and dribbles away for four. Here endeth the PowerPlay, with a modest total but not many wickets, so honours are just about even. 5th over: Essex 30-1 (Westley 22, Wheater 6) Westley, who is usually measured, says to himself \u201cSod that\u201d and plays a whip-drive past a startled mid-off. Ten from the over, without trying too hard. Here\u2019s Tom van der Gucht. \u201cThe Worcs and Notts game was incredible. Although, having said that, I only tuned in for the last two overs, so my objectivity is probably a little questionable. But still, what a collapse and what a finish. Can they muster something similar now in the final? Who needs scores of 200-plus to make it entertaining?\u201d 4th over: Essex 20-1 (Westley 14, Wheater 4) On comes Pat Brown, whose Twenty20 bowling average is under 20, and who may get an England call-up on Monday. He comes bearing knuckle balls and concedes only four. Essex need 126 off 16 overs at a rate of nearly eight. 3rd over: Essex 16-1 (Westley 14, Wheater 0) That wicket was a big one, given the fifty Delport stroked earlier. In that knock, he outshone Westley, but maybe Westley was just waiting for an even bigger stage. He clips Parnell off his legs, for all the world as if this was a decent pitch. Moeen takes himself off, brings on Parnell, sends Wessels out to cow corner... and bags Delport! Who clips a full toss straight down Wessels\u2019 throat. 2nd over: Essex 8-0 (Westley 7, Delport 1) It\u2019s seam from the other end, in the shape of Charlie Morris. well, seam and a few cutters. Tom Westley on-drives him for the first four of the innings, handsomely. Is anyone else old enough to remember when Westley played for England? 1st over: Essex 1-0 (Westley 1, Delport 0) The openers treat Moeen with due respect \u2013 but they don\u2019t get off to the usual flier. No sign of the dew, which has been talked about a lot, but not actually witnessed. Moeen\u2019s going to open the bowling, which is a gamble. The easiest time to bat is the first six overs. An email comes in. \u201cSimon Harmer, SPOTY,\u201d says the subject line. \u201cNuff said,\u201d says the rest of the email. Nice one, Simon Thomas \u2013 though you may have just libelled Ben Stokes. Brett D\u2019Oliveira plays a fine pull for four, then gets caught at cow corner off the very last ball for 10. But there are four byes in the mix too, so Worcestershire end up with the sort of total they defended this morning \u2013 145, not 147, but the pitch is turning even more now than it was then. The two captains have continued their masterclass, Moeen top-scoring with 32, Harmer grabbing three more wickets. Neither of them deserves to lose. It\u2019s obviously going to be a tie. Bopara is back, with his super-slo-mo seamers, and an attempted ramp by Barnard just results in a dolly to backward point. 19th over: Worcs 135-7 (D\u2019Oliveira 5, Barnard 5) A handy last over from Nijjar goes for only five, so he finishes with 4-0-31-0. Worcester need a couple of huge hits, which may be asking too much on this surface. 18th over: Worcs 130-7 (D\u2019Oliveira 3, Barnard 2) Wickets are falling like autumn leaves, but Worcestershire are still finding runs \u2013 seven an over for the last five. And they did defend a less than towering total in the semi. Whiteley swings for six, as expected, but then falls trying to repeat the shot. Essex are having all the fun at the moment. Mitchell, who has been busy, perishes tamely, carving Lawrence to backward point. That\u2019s every team innings today in miniature: starting well, then falling foul of this dirt-brown pitch. 16th over: Worcs 113-5 (Mitchell 14, Whiteley 0) Mitchell\u2019s still there, and he is joined by Ross Whiteley, who can hit a long ball. Harmer\u2019s figures for the two games, seven for 35, have now been pronounced the best-ever on Finals Day. Wessels is dropped, a quarter-chance to Harmer on the long-off boundary, and celebrates his reprieve by... being run out going for a single, and not diving. That\u2019s a dim end to a bright innings. 15th over: Worcs 107-4 (Wessels 27, Mitchell 13) Mitchell finds the boundary again, pulling Bopara behind square. Wessels hasn\u2019t managed a boundary for some weeks, but to be fair he\u2019s only faced eight balls in the last five overs, scoring six off them. 13th over: Worcs 98-4 (Wessels 25, Mitchell 7) Mitchell cuts for four off Nijjar, who nonetheless manages a better over than his first. 13th over: Worcs 90-4 (Wessels 24, Mitchell 1) Harmer finishes another lethal spell with figures of 4-0-16-3. The headlines will write themselves tonight, whoever wins: Captain Fantastic. There\u2019s plenty of brown dirt about, too. Say what you like about his bowling changes, Harmer is a hell of a bowler. He skids one on \u2013 in the dew? \u2013 to defeat Parnell\u2019s cut, and to take his seventh wicket of Finals Day, equalling the record. 12th over: Worcs 89-3 (Wessels 24, Parnell 19) Lawrence returns for another of his one-over spells and does OK, conceding seven with no boundaries. But Wessels is still there, holding the show together, and Parnell is ticking along. I just wonder if Harmer has made too many bowling changes. Has he been, in the immortal words of Prince, too funky? 11th over: Worcs 82-3 (Wessels 22, Parnell 14) Harmer bowls a hell of an over for no wickets, switching from over the wicket to round, getting more spin than a Government spokesperson. Apparently he was called in by England to help them in the nets before the Lord\u2019s Test. No wonder Nathan Lyon suddenly found life so difficult. 10th over: Worcs 75-3 (Wessels 21, Parnell 13) Wayne Parnell has a dinner date to get to. He greets Nijjar by thumping him down the ground for six, and picks up another four by nutmegging the keeper. So that\u2019s the halfway stage, and Worcs are halfway to a score that would have been enough in either of the semis. 9th over: Worcs 62-3 (Wessels 20, Parnell 1) Well. Not only was Cox playing a shot, outside the line \u2013 he actually hit the ball, poor guy. But there\u2019s no DRS, so Harmer has 2-2 in that over, and six wickets today. He\u2019s done it again, again. Just like in the semi, Harmer takes two in two. He gets lucky this time, as Cox may well have been struck outside the line. But still... What a moment. One captain bowls, a slow off-break (leggie to the left-hander), gripping the surface. The other is lured into his clip to leg a touch too early, gets it high on the bat. It\u2019s a tough return chance, but Harner knows he has to hold on, diving to his left, and he does. That feels like a turning point. 8th over: Worcs 60-1 (Moeen 32, Wessels 19) A better over from Bopara, who\u2019s bowling so slow that if he doesn\u2019t like the look of any particular ball, he may well be able to run after it and take it back. 7th over: Worcs 54-1 (Moeen 30, Wessels 15) Yes, it\u2019s Harmer. And he doesn\u2019t take a wicket! In fact, he goes for six as Riki Wessels deposits him back over his head with a drop-kick. That\u2019s great play from Wessels, spotting that Mo, being left-handed, might not unfurl the sixes against a top-class off-spinner on a pitch made of stale Digestives. 6th over: Worcs 47-1 (Moeen 29, Wessels 9) Time for Ravi Bopara, bowling slow-medium or even slower than that, and Moeen\u2019s eyes light up. He waits for one and swings it over midwicket for six, so the PowerPlay ends well for Worcs. Essex have just got to get Moeen out. In the first semi-final, he had the highest strike rate of any batsman, and the lowest economy rate of any bowler: the Platonic ideal of leading from the front. Harmer needs to weigh up his options and send for himself. 5th over: Worcs 38-1 (Moeen 21, Wessels 8) Not content with taking Lawrence off, Simon Harmer brings him straight back on. And it works, as the ball sticks in the pitch and the batsmen keep finding the fielders. \u201cTerrific over!\u201d says D Lloyd. Run rate now down below eight. 4th over: Worcs 36-1 (Moeen 20, Wessels 7) Cook manages three dots to Moeen, which is some achievement \u2013 though the next ball goes for six, as Mo plays one of those lovely lazy languid flicks of his. It\u2019s the only scoring shot of the over, and the run rate so far plummets to nine. 3rd over: Worcs 30-1 (Moeen 14, Wessels 7) Lawrence is rewarded for his early breakthrough by being taken off. On comes Aaron Beard, who bowls three wides, but also finds a full length that allows only a few singles off the bat. An email! From Brendan Large. \u201cNasser and Keys were mentioning the possibility of the pitch getting a bit quicker under the lights, due to dew or some such.\u201d They were. \u201cThis may be the reason for Essex opting to take the ball first.\u201d It may. \u201cIf it is, feel free to delete the mention of Nasser and Keys, and give me all possible undue credit for my knowledge of cricket pitches.\u201d Ha. 2nd over: Worcs 23-1 (Moeen 12, Wessels 5) The first over of seam comes from Sam Cook, the only man playing here who hasn\u2019t already got through one game today. He may be a little rusty: he gives both batsmen something to cut, and Moeen something to pull too. Advantage Worcs. 1st over: Worcs 10-1 (Moeen 4, Wessels 0) Moeen\u2019s in the mood. He gets off the mark with a typical waft \u2013 airy, elegant, risky, and four. A wide, a four (off the edge), and a wicket, as Dan Lawrence turns one sharply past Hamish Rutherford\u2019s attempted on-drive. It seemed a wacky move by Harmer to open the bowling with Lawrence. It doesn\u2019t now. .. a wide. This is the latest date in the year that Finals Day has ever been, so there\u2019s a lot of chat about the dew. David Lloyd, Sky\u2019s in-house gardener, sees no sign of it yet, but Simon Harmer\u2019s decision to bowl must have something to do with it. It\u2019s dew or die. Who\u2019s your money on? Essex started the T20 season abominably, and so did Worcestershire, so it\u2019s like the 1992 World Cup final all over again, except that both sides are Pakistan. There are tigers in every corner. At Edgbaston, Sweet Caroline is ringing out. The singing is almost certainly being led by Graham Hardcastle. The toss was hosted by Nasser Hussain. Nothing wrong with that, he\u2019s an excellent broadcaster, but he was wearing a puffy gilet, and he is a bit thin on top. Has anyone ever seen him in the same room as Dominic Cummings? Essex Eagles: Westley, Delport, Lawrence, ten Doeschate, Bopara, Wheater (wkt), Walter, Harmer (capt), Nijjar, Beard, Cook. That\u2019s tough on Jamie Porter, who makes way for Sam Cook at the bottom of the order. Worcestershire Rapids: Rutherford, Wessels, Moeen (capt), Cox (wkt), D\u2019Oliveira, Whiteley, Parnell, Barnard, Mitchell, Brown, Morris. ...and opt to bowl, even though both semis were won by the team batting first. Does Simon Harmer know something we don\u2019t, apart from how to bowl beautiful off-breaks? Hello again, good evening and welcome to the Vitality Blast final. You know that feeling when your team win a semi-final, and you can sit back, safe in the knowledge that you\u2019ve got all the fun of a final to look forward to? Many fans have three weeks to bask in that. Essex fans have had about an hour. This Finals Day is crazy \u2013 but still fun. Ravi Rampaul holes out and poor old Derbyshire, who decided to do or die, have done and died. This was their first taste of Finals Day. It\u2019s Essex\u2019s fifth, and the first time they\u2019ve made it through to the evening. They win by 34 runs \u2013 a triumph for their T20 captain, Simon Harmer, who finishes with career-best figures of 4-19. He was in a league of his own, although, like all good sorcerers, he brought along his apprentice, Aron Nijjar (3-26). And all this was possible because Cameron Delport and Tom Westley added 78 for Essex\u2019s first wicket. See you in a bit for the Vitality Blast final, starting at 6.45pm BST: it\u2019ll be Essex v Worcestershire, or, to put it another way, Harmer v Moeen. Harmer does it again! First ball back, he persuades Smit to reverse-sweep straight to the man at backward point. End of a brave partnership, 27 off 22 balls. Ten off that over, not enough to worry Essex, but not bad. Derbs need 43 off three, and the bad news for them is that Harmer is bringing himself back on. Hang on. Derbs are not going down without a smite. First Daryn Smit laps Lawrence for four, then Logan van Beek wallops him for six, down the ground, 94m apparently. On 109-8 now, they need 53 from the last four overs, which should be impossible, especially on a piece of old toast, but you never know. There\u2019s been some chuntering about the pitch, which is now a spinna\u2019s paradise. When they show it in close-up, it looks like the slice of wholemeal toast that you left in the toaster before you went on holiday. (Football spoiler alert) Derbyshire have now lost as many wickets as Watford conceded goals today. Oh dear. Yet another one. They\u2019re not even worth an exclamation mark any more. Hughes hung in there, which is more than can be said for his mates, but eventually he is lured down the track by Nijjar, who finishes with 3-26. That is a great comeback after his first four balls went for 14. 12th over: Derbyshire 85-6 (Hughes 23, Smit 3) Harmer is enjoying this slow torture so much, he takes himself off and tries a third spinner, Dan Lawrence, with his part-time leggies. His over goes for only three. It\u2019s all becoming a bit one-sided. The Essex spinners have taken five for 37 in six overs, all bowled. Another one! It\u2019s do or Derbs as Critchley aims a big slog-sweep at Nijjar, who beats him in the flight. Essex, so often the bridesmaid on finals day, are getting married in the evening. 10th over: Derbyshire 78-5 (Hughes 20, Critchley 4) Harmer ruins his figures by drifting down leg and letting Hughes pick up four with the tickliest of tickles. And that\u2019s the halfway stage, with half the wickets gone, and just under half the runs scored. Derbs need 83 off ten, which should be too much. He\u2019s done it again! the very next ball, Anuj Dal opts to charge Harmer, plays outside the line of another off-break and departs with his tail between his pads. Harmer\u2019s decided to do it all by himself. He doesn\u2019t get the hat-trick, but he does finish the over with the ridiculous figures of 2-0-6-3. That is a wonderball. Harmer drifts it into middle and leg and turns it so sharply that it hits the off bail again. du Plooy plods off and Harmer has 2-5 in eight balls of effortless mastery. Look away now if you don\u2019t want to know any football scores. Man City have scored seven against Watford and there\u2019s still half an hour to go. They\u2019ve invented Twenty20 football. 6th over: Derbyshire 59-3 (du Plooy 5, Hughes 9) So the Powerplay ends and all you can say is: this one may not go the distance. That last over was bowled by Ravi Bopara, who should be tricky on this sticky surface, and Derbyshire helped themselves to 11. They\u2019re not going to die wondering. Harmer is so chuffed with his own over (1-0-4-1) that he goes for spin at the other end too, in the form of Aron Nijjar. Aron who? He\u2019s a slow left-armer in a sharp pair of shades. Wayne Madsen sees a chance to dominate \u2013 four, six, four, much like Reece at the start of the innings. But just like Reece, he soon perishes, as Nijjar keeps calm and bowls him round his legs. Derbs are ahead of the run rate, but are they paying too high a price? Captain to captain and... Harmer strikes first ball! It beats Godleman for lack of pace, turns a bit and clips the off bail. 3rd over: Derbyshire 30-1 (Godleman 9, Madsen 2) Billy Godleman was a bit of a sleeping partner in that opening stand, contributing not a single run. He makes up for it now with a textbook cover push off Porter, beautifully timed, and a clip for four more. Porter has 2-0-24-0 \u2013 he may be too quick for this surface. Heeere\u2019s Harmer. He was a good pinch-hitter as pinch-hitters go, and as pinch-hitters go, he\u2019s GONE. Reece nicks again and this time Wheater dives to his left to make a grab that would have gone straight to the still-absent first slip. Reece did well, 19 off only seven balls, to add to a tidy two-for. Pinch-hitting is back! Derbyshire have started with four, four, six, all scored by Luis Reece off Jamie Porter. The first four was a nick through the sadly vacant slips, but the next one was an authentic whack to leg and so was the six. Given all that, Porter recovers well: Derbyshire 15-0 off one. Afternoon everyone and thanks Graham. Remember that moment when Michael Gove said the British people were fed up with experts? Govey, lad, I hope you\u2019re reading now, because a true expert on the county game has just handed over to someone who tries to wear his expertise lightly, for the simple reason that he doesn\u2019t have any. so, bear with me, please, as you follow Derbyshire\u2019s pursuit of Essex\u2019s 160. Derbyshire have the momentum, after dragging it back from 78-0 after eight overs. But Essex have more on the board than either team managed in the first semi, and they hold the trump card (can we still use that term?) in their captain and star spinner Simon Harmer. It could, in short, go either way. Essex have finished with 160-5. I think both sides will be reasonably content. Could have been better, could have been worse will be their view I would suggest. Anyway, I shall hand over the baton to Tim de Lisle, who will guide you through the rest of the day. Enjoy. Oh and given I won\u2019t get chance later on... SWEET CAROLINE, bah, bah, bah!! Little and Large are at the crease for Essex going into the last two overs (145-5). Adam Wheater and Paul Walter, the latter at 6ft seven and the other five foot nothing, will be hoping for around 20 off the last two overs. Essex are 123-4 after 15 overs and on course to post a challenging total on a used pitch. I reckon they would have snapped your hand off for 160 before a ball was bowled, and they should get there. Ravi Bopara is into the twenties and has Adam Wheater for company. Derbyshire have struck twice since my last post through industrious medium pacer Alex Hughes, removing Delport for 55 and Dan Lawrence for five. Essex are 93-2 in the 11th. I just nipped out to get a bottle of water a few moments ago and the media centre is full of folk shaking their heads. What happened in the first semi has not sunk in yet. The Hollies are in full swing now and have just had a beach ball confiscated by the stewards. \u201cWe want our ball back, we want our ball back, WE WANT OUR BALL BACK.\u201d Essex are 65-0 after seven overs. Essex are going well and have the early advantage. They have reached 50-0 in the early stages of the sixth over. Delport has 36 of them. Nottinghamshire coach Peter Moores is understandably crestfallen after his side somehow contrived to lose a match they looked to be in total control of. He said: \u201cI can\u2019t remember a game like that - it\u2019s quite difficult to explain. It\u2019s as gutting a loss as I can remember. \u201cWith a couple of overs to go it felt like we couldn\u2019t lose, but Worcestershire, to their credit, bowled brilliantly. \u201cIn those situations you trust the players in the middle. We knew one more boundary in those last couple of overs would have been enough. Ben Duckett, who played brilliantly, is distraught that he couldn\u2019t get us over the line.\u201d Compared to what we saw earlier, this has been a fairly quiet start. Essex, through Tom Westley and Cameron Delport, have moved to 21-0 in the third over. Derbyshire: Godleman (c), Reece, Madsen, du Plooy, Hudson-Prentice, Hughes, Dal, Smit (wk), Critchley, van Beek, Rampaul. Essex: Westley, Delport, Wheater (wk), Lawrence, ten Doeschate, Bopara, Walter, Harmer (c), Nijjar, Beard, Porter. Derbyshire\u2019s Freddie the Falcon has won the Mascot Race. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign,\u201d exclaims Mark Eklid, of the Derby Telegraph. The Notts mascot also tripped. Essex have won the toss and they\u2019ll have first knock against Derbyshire. Extraordinary! Not sure how, but Worcester have won by one run. Duckett misses the last ball off Parnell. Now, things will continue to happen at pace. Mascot race, toss for the next game - Essex v Derbyshire, which starts at 2.30pm - and the press conference for this game just done. I will try to keep you up to date with all of them. Incredible. Seven off the last over becomes two off the last ball. Duckett on strike against Parnell. Ooohh. Two wickets for Pat Brown in the 19th, Christian and Tom Moores both caught. Notts need nine off nine (139-4). Duckett is 47 and club captain Mullaney has just strode to the crease. Now Mullaney is run out coming back for two following an almighty mix-up. Eight off eight. 140-5. It\u2019s all happening. I have just been asked for flavour, pardon the pun, of the catering options on offer here. Breakfast was bacon or veggie sausage butties, while lunch was chicken or veggie curry or roast dinner. Then you get varying selections of sweets and cheese and biscuits if you want. Evening meal and supper yet to come if previous years are anything to go by. Pace yourself!! And that is exactly what Notts have done. They are cruising again at 133-2 in the 18th - 15 to win off as many balls. This game is still alive. Notts need 41 off five overs, at 107-2. Notts remain heavy favourites, but I have seen plenty of games like this swing the way of the bowling side. Duckett (28) and Dan Christian (5) are unbeaten. Gone....Hales is caught behind for 52 off Moeen. Notts are 100-2 in the 14th over. Hales reaches his fifth fifty of this season\u2019s Blast off 39 balls. Losing his central contract yesterday, it just had to be, didn\u2019t it! Notts are cruising at 97-1. Notts are 83-1 at halfway, with Hales 40 and Duckett 19. The latter has just reverse slog-swept Brett D\u2019Oliveira for a four which was inches from being six. The atmosphere is quite subdued around the ground at the moment. This is a day where you definitely need to pace yourself, and this has the feel of the calm before the storm. The power plays may have been similar, but this game has a Notts win written all over it as long as Hales remains at the crease. He has hardly broken sweat and is 30 not out from 60-1 after eight overs. Ben Duckett is with him. The Outlaws need 88 more for victory. Problems for Worcester! Nash and Hales have taken the score to 44-0 after five overs. Hales has done the lion\u2019s share of the scoring since my last post, moving swiftly to 20. Notts are off to a bright start at 25-0 after two overs, with Chris Nash 20 not out. He has hit three fours and a pulled six in 11 balls. Alex Hales is one not out off one ball at the other end. Sport is amazing isn\u2019t it. Nash hadn\u2019t played all tournament before the semi-final win over Middlesex, and now he is flying. Worcester set Notts 148, Ross Whiteley contributing 36 and Riki Wessels 34 in their 147-9. It should not be enough, but the pressure of a run chase in a semi-final and all that.... The pitch has looked a bit tricky to time the ball on. Only Moeen and Whiteley at either end of the innings really got going. For Notts, Matt Carter led the way with three wickets, while Harry Gurney and Steven Mullaney chipped in with two apiece. I actually think Samit Patel deserves a lot of credit. Wicketless, yes, but his 0-17 from three overs was key in putting the skids under the Rapids midway through the innings. One over to go for the Rapids. Whiteley is still there, but Notts have bowled well at him during the last over or two. 137-7. Here comes the Worcester charge through Ross Whiteley, who has hit three sixes and a four in the last five minutes, peppering long-on and long-off. He has 30 off 16 balls, and it\u2019s 125-7 from 17 overs. Apparently there is someone dressed as WWE wrestler, The Undertaker, in the Hollies stand. Worcester aren\u2019t quite dead and buried yet, but at 97-7 in the 15th, with Ed Barnard run out just now, they definitely have Paul Bearer tottering behind them. Huge wicket. Riki Wessels is bowled by a Steven Mullaney slower ball via pad as he looks to slog sweep, falling for 34. It\u2019s 89-5 in the 13th over. My 170 is looking a way off now. There is a lot of preparation which needs doing for Finals Day. I have done a few of these down the years and find that given the extraordinary catering which is provided for the media, it means you have to be careful with you what eat for around a fortnight beforehand. To give you an idea, it\u2019s like an episode of Man vs Food or Diners, Drive-ins and Dives which follows it on the FoodNetwork channel (if you\u2019re ever struggling for something to watch). Anyway, Worcester are 69-2 after nine overs. Riki Wessels has 27 and Wayne Parnell nine. A minimum 170 total is needed I would suggest. Hang on, as I type, Parnell loops Steven Mullaney up to cover. It\u2019s 76-3 in the 10th. Moeen has fallen for a breezy 21, including three sixes. Carter, the tall Notts\u2019 off-spinner, uproots his off stump on the slog sweep. A huge wicket for the Outlaws, who have their second. It\u2019s 40-2 in the fifth over. The prized wicket may have been taken, but Notts must continue to strike given the strength and depth of the Rapids\u2019 batting order. Wow! Two sixes from Moeen Ali off his second and third balls, both over long-on against Matt Carter and the first significantly bigger than the second. Worcester 32-1 after three overs. Alex Hales into the action in the second over with an excellent catch over his head, running back from cover to help Matt Carter get rid of New Zealander Hamish Rutherford. Worcestershire 10-1. The ground is just under half full at the moment, but the fancy dress in the Hollies stand is in full swing nevertheless. I spy a large group of Chelsea Pensioners and a fair few bananas. Nottinghamshire captain Dan Christian wins the toss and will bowl first. Worcestershire: Wessels, Rutherford, Moeen (c), Cox (wk), D\u2019Oliveira, Whiteley, Parnell, Mitchell, Barnard, Morris, Brown. Nottinghamshire: Hales, Nash, Clarke, Duckett, Patel, Moores (wk), Christian (c), Mullaney, Wood, Carter, Gurney. Good morning from Edgbaston, where it is a glorious start to cricket\u2019s longest day. And, for the avoidance of doubt, I don\u2019t say that with any negativity. Vitality Blast Finals Day is one of the very best days. Three games, a Mascot race and copious amounts of Sweet Caroline. What more could you want? There are many who believe it is the best day of the year. Given my Northern roots, I will argue the toss against anyone and say that it doesn\u2019t top the Blast Roses games. But it\u2019s not far behind, I grant you. We have four teams on show, three from the North and one from the South and two who would be first time winners of the competition - Essex and Derbyshire. Those two counties meet in the second semi-final at 2.30pm following on from a clash between the two most recent champions Worcestershire (2018) v Nottinghamshire (2017). That one gets us going at 11am. Worcester and Notts are the bookies favourites, but I have heard a few people over the last week say, \u2018I have a sneaking suspicion for Derbyshire\u2019. This is their first appearance at Finals Day since the Blast started in 2003. I, personally, am leaning towards Essex. They crept into quarter-finals by winning three out of their last four group games, with the other a tie, and then beat runaway North Group winners Lancashire in their quarter-final at Durham when the game was going the way of the Lightning. You hear players and coaches talking about how momentum is so crucial in this format of the game. Well, the Eagles have it. It would be one heck of a six days for Anthony McGrath\u2019s side given they are top of the County Championship by 12 points from Somerset with a round to go. They travel to Taunton on Monday. I will be splitting blogging duties with Tim de Lisle today, who takes over halfway through the second semi-final. The final begins at 6.45pm. Enjoy the day.",

Sapporo\u2019s notorious entertainment district is a block of 20-storey tower blocks, neon from the pavement up: restaurants, bars, gaming parlours, cinemas, salons and love hotels, heaving with off-duty office workers and, for this weekend at least, several thousand English and Australian rugby fans.

Sapporo\u2019s notorious entertainment district is a block of 20-storey tower blocks, neon from the pavement up: restaurants, bars, gaming parlours, cinemas, salons and love hotels, heaving with off-duty office workers and, for this weekend at least, several thousand English and Australian rugby fans. The England team are staying 10 blocks away, just the other side of the river. They haven\u2019t been any further than the local cafe. \u201cWe just tend to find the best coffee shops if we can,\u201d said Owen Farrell. But the atmosphere was crackling in their hotel. England are, as Eddie Jones says, about to go over the top of a rollercoaster they have been riding ever since they arrived at their training camp 10 weeks or so ago. You could see it in Jones, who seemed so wired he was almost vibrating with nervous energy, and hear it in George Ford:\u201cIt\u2019s through the roof, we can\u2019t wait to get out there,\u201d and Courtney Lawes: \u201cI am very, very excited.\u201d They were grinning like kids who have burst into their parents\u2019 bedroom on Christmas morning. If they were worried about anything, it was that the team are too wound up. Both mentioned it, which tells you it is something they have all been talking about in their meetings. \u201cWe have to contain ourselves,\u201d said Lawes, echoing Ford, who said: \u201cWe need that balance of keeping our control and our discipline.\u201d Which is where Farrell comes in. The captain, arms folded across his chest, was just as calm and level\u2011headed as he always is and has been. You guess on his Christmas mornings he left the presents to his siblings and skipped out to practise his kicking. \u201cI probably try and take more of the emotion out of it because I need to be able to think clearly and make good decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to be in control of what you\u2019re doing.

OK, that\u2019s harsh, since it was not too long ago that Antonio Conte was storming the Premier League with Chelsea. And in Italy, he is nothing close to being a reject; he is one of the country\u2019s most prolific active managers along with Massimiliano Allegri. In Romelu Lukaku, he has his man, the striker he wanted to sign before the Belgian was redirected to Manchester United. And Inter are top of the league, knocking Juventus off the perch for the first time in 552 days. Lukaku\u2019s impact on the field has been positive so far - the reaction to him on the terraces far less so - though he did struggle in the midweek 1-1 draw with Slavia Prague. Alexis Sanchez has been less productive, though a story in the Italian press suggests he backed up his old United buddy in a dressing-room fracas. <br><br>But now for the first big test of the season, and AC Milan, a rival on harder times and flushed with rather less talent.

      "bodyText": "A comprehensive, deserved win for Inter, whose mettle for the title was untested by a poor performance from Milan. Not that Milan lacked effort, just quality. Lukaku\u2019s goal was a typical header on a night he was actually rather quiet but Antonio Conte looks to have Inter heading in the right direction, having made an almost instant impact on the previously ailing giant. It\u2019s a 100% record so far for his team. Milan are in ninth place, and suffering, having already lost twice. 90+3 min: Almost a third. Candreva, on the break, skips away, then fires a shot that came off a Milan defender off one post and then another. 90+1 min: Suso continues to buzz around, but Inter\u2019s defence has had his measure and those of his fellow Milan attackers all evening. 90 min: Five minutes added on in stoppage time. 89 min: Inter sat back on this now. AC Milan trying to find a way through but we are in the last knockings. 88 min: Some glum faces in red and black. It seems fair to predict that the city spoils in terms of the league table will be going to Inter. 86 min: Rebic\u2019s flick sets Theo Hernandez on a run that takes him deep into the Inter defence and, with nobody else to pass to, he rattles his left-foot shot off the post. Milan\u2019s subs have all been decent, begging the question why they didn\u2019t start in the first place. Marco Giampaolo will have severe questions to answer after this. 84 min: Milan have a free-kick that Biglia makes a right mess of. Their fans are heading home now. 83 min: Rebic, on for Leao as Milan\u2019s final sub, looks instantly lively. But he looks to have been introduced far too late. 82 min: Inter sub: Barella off for Candreva. There will be no sighting of Alexis Sanchez tonight. 80 min: Lukaku is full of confidence and lays off the ball to Politano for a shot that rattles off the crossbar. The team most likely to score next at this point is Inter. 79 min: Who enjoyed that more? Madame Lukaku or Antonio Conte? There was a real beamer on the face of Inter\u2019s manager. Imagine if they had hooked up at Chelsea. Romelu and Antonio, not Conte and Madame Lukaku, that is. \u201cMaman, je t\u2019aime,\u201d says Lukaku as he runs to the camera after making a great header from Barella\u2019s great cross. A fine goal and one on his derby debut. 76 min: Sub for Inter: Martinez of for Politano. 75 min: Godin\u2019s foul on Paqueta sets up a free-kick that comes to nothing for AC Milan when Romagnoli pushes his opposing defender. 72 min: Subs: Rodriguez off for Theo Hernandez, the Frenchman signed from Real Madrid, for Milan. Inter take off Sensi and put on Vecino. Hernandez, by the way, is the brother of Lucas Hernandez of Bayern Munich. 71 min: AC Milan pushing on now, and Inter sitting back. Fatal, perhaps, but it was Antonio Conte\u2019s team who did most of the running for the first hour. 69 min: Godin sweeps up Piatek and Suso with some fierce tackling and cool play. Milan\u2019s attack is looking brittle, toothless. 66 min: At last, some combination play from Martinez and Lukaku, but the Argentinian\u2019s shot is blocked. Then there is one hell of a stramash in the AC Milan box after which Donnarumma cliams the ball. 64 min: Milan sub: Paqueta comes on for Calhanoglu on the left-hand side of midfield. He goes close - almost instantly - to setting up a chance for Piatek. 63 min: Milan push forward, perhaps realising that\u2019s the best way of protecting their creaking backline. There is not much composure when they get forward, though. 61 min: More heavy pressure from Inter. Brozovic\u2019s shot, then Martinez\u2019s volley and Donnarumma is kept busy. Milan hanging on. 60 min: A brief glimpse of where Milan might benefit when Leao goes close to burning off Godin for pace only for the old dog to recover. 57 min: Inter forward in numbers before Brozovic has a shot from distance. In the San Siro, the fireworks are going off. The \u2018away\u2019 team is very much in the ascendancy. 55 min: Suso is brought down and wins a free-kick. There is a call for the free-kick having hit a hand but no dice. Lukaku defends the corner with a towering header. 54 min: What can Milan find? They are under the cosh. Sensi had chance to release Lukaku but chose not to find his team-mate, instead running into a wall of defenders. 52 min: Inter had begun the half as the brighter team but that goal was somewhat scrappy, and confusing with the VAR adding extra spice to the confusion. This is the second season of VAR in Serie A and they are getting used to it. There was little in the way of protest from Milan\u2019s players. Leao\u2019s deflection was a result of a rather less than manly addressing of Brozovic\u2019s free-kick. Goal? Or is it? Brozovic\u2019s free-kick squirms off the wall, and into the goal. But is Martinez interfering with play? He looked onside. It came off Leao, and there is some VAR. The ref runs to look at it, and decides it\u2019s a goal. Conte\u2019s celebration is muted. But the Inter fans\u2019 is not. 48 min: First booking. Sensi is fouled by Conti and makes enough of it that the Milan defender gets a yellow.... 47 min: Lautaro Mart\u00ednez was upended as he went on a winding run; he and Lukaku rather operating as satellites of each other. 46 min: Lukaku begins the second half by chasing a long ball but Donnarumma comes out to clear, bailing out Romagnoli as he does so. There have been no changes at half-time as we go again in this finely balanced derby. A familiar face on the mark in the latest update of our Euro roundup. Chances for both teams and both have had the ball in the net, only to see their attempts disallowed. Donnarumma has been outstanding as a shot-stopper for Milan which suggests that Inter have shaded it so far. 45+2 min: Lukaku has gone quiet but he does his job at the other end, heading away a Suso free-kick. Inter having to get through some defensive labour as the half-time whistle approaches. 45 min: There will be three minutes added on. 44 min: Milan\u2019s best chance? Leao gets to the byline and dinks it up for Piatek, whose header is too high. Ambrosio, at wing-back, was beaten all ends up by Leao\u2019s skill and pace. 42 min: AC Milan\u2019s Kessie is down, with what looks like a shoulder problem. The lull in player sees Donnarumma run to the bench for advice. Milan have been having trouble playing out from the back against Inter\u2019s pressing game. Kessie recovers himself to carry on 41 min: Suso sets off on a winding run, having left Sensi for dead, and with just Handanovic to beat - or so it seemed - Asamoah, running back, got in a vital block. 39 min: That disallowed goal got the AC Milan fans going when their team has not been capable of doing so. That\u2019s one benefit of VAR, though in truth it was the referee who had ruled out the goal out in the first place. 36 min: Inter get the ball in the net, and Conte is jumping for joy. Donnarumma made a great save from a spectacular overhead volley from Ambrosio and Martinez knocks it into the goal...but, it\u2019s disallowed and after a lengthy VAR break it\u2019s ruled out completely. Ambrosio was offside and so perhaps was Ambrosio. 34 min: Giampaolo, the AC Milan coach, seems to have shifted his team around with the aim of gaining control of midfield. It\u2019s not paying off at the moment since Inter have stepped it up again. Barela forces a corner. 33 min: Antonio Conte\u2019s watery blue eyes are beginning to charge with energy. Could be a fun half-time for his players; he has never lost to Milan in his career and he will not want to start with his first Milan derby. 31 min: John Davis writes in, pinpointing an MBM-er\u2019s worst nightmare: \u201cHope this missive finds you well. Idly perusing the starting line-ups, I noticed there are five separate diacritics (accents on letters - yes, I did wiki that) in the AC Milan team: Kessi\u00e9, \u00c7alhano\u011flu, Pi\u0105tek, Lea\u00f5. That seems like quite the haul. One for The Knowledge?\u201d 30 min: Godin\u2019s nous and sheer experience means that he has the vision to come across and stop a ball aimed for Leao. He takes no prisoners but is all class, too. 28 min: Inter on the back foot; their turn to look for the counterattack. 26 min: That corner is cleared straight away and when Conti tries to get the ball back in. Milan settle for some possession, choosing to rest on the ball. 25 min: Milan stepping this up? Calhanoglu has a shot and Milan force a corner. 23 min: Milan have the ball in the net when Calhanoglu fires past Handanovic, but the ball had bounced off Kessie\u2019s elbow. Remember, if a hand and elbow is involved, then the goal will be ruled out. Still, at least Milan were able to mount an attack. The referee had blown the whistle when the scorer was swinging at the ball. He played dumb but must have known. 21 min: Inter hit the post! It seemed a certain goal. Sensi\u2019s pass found Martinez, and the ball falls for D\u2019Ambrosio who clear on goal and with it gaping. He hits the woodwork under duress from Rodriguez. Another fine save from Donnarumma and his defender bailed him out. 20 min: Donnarumma did well there, but Lukaku will know he might have done far better with that chance. It was the type of finish Manchester United fans may recognise. 19 min: Chance for Lukaku! He gets one one one after a fine Martinez flick and his right-foot shot is saved by Donnarumma. The angle didn\u2019t quite open up for the Belgian. 17 min: So far, this has not been a great advert for the new Serie A but it does feature the teams with the best defensive record in the league - both have conceded just one goal. 16 min: Godin goes on a loping run forward from defence, and Lukaku gets chance to speed on. His cross is headed away and Lautaro is fouled as Milan fail to clear the ball. A free-kick chance it is, which Sensi takes but the wall jumps as one to nod stop it reaching Donnarumma. 15 min: Donnarumma has yet to win a Milan derby since his first with the club. 13 min: AC Milan being pushed back, but have the counter as their weapon. Inter\u2019s defence is not the quickest. 11 min: Lukaku, dropping deep and with his back to goal, sets up an attack with his hold-up play but the move comes to nothing....but..ooh...Rodriguez plays the ball back to Donnarumma and the goalkeeper had to scramble it when Barella was hunting him down. Panicked stuff; Conte employing a very high pressing game. 9 min: It\u2019s cagey, not a proper attack or goal attempt to speak of just yet. 7 min: Antonio Conte looks anxious on the bench, though has not yet reached the shouty stage that he usually reverts to. 5 min: Kessie, who is almost a foot taller than Sensi, stops his Inter opposite number in his tracks and he wins a free-kick in the process. 4 min: Ronaldo, the Brazilian version, is in the crowd, and sat not too far from Pierluigi Collina. 3 min: Godin, on the right of a back three, has to come across and stop Leao\u2019s run. There\u2019s a battle-heartened veteran for you. 1 min: Barella of Inter is found offside from a long ball. The Conte plan was always to hit the front as quickly as possible. The captains, Handanovic and Romagnoli, shake hands and we are underway. Romelu Lukaku looks a little pensive as Inter take the kick-off. Hopefully, it will be better than this game. San Siro looks resplendent in the early-evening gloom, and there\u2019s a light show decorating the skies as the teams take to the field, climbing those famous stairs into the open air. And the fans are doing their best to make it a special atmosphere. Twenty years ago, this was the biggest derby game on the planet but this is a story of two clubs trying to bounce back. The teams in more analogue, less flashy form. AC Milan: Donnarumma; Conti, Musacchio, Romagnoli, Rodriguez; Kessi\u00e9, Biglia, \u00c7alhano\u011flu; Suso, Pi\u0105tek, Lea\u00f5 Inter: Handanovic ; Skriniar, de Vrij, God\u00edn; D\u2019Ambrosio, Barella, Brozovi\u0107, Sensi, Asamoah; Lautaro, Lukaku No better primer for the state of play in Serie A than Nicky Bandini\u2019s column. She\u2019ll be back on Monday for more. And a reminder of the issue casting a cloud over the Serie A season so far. Some red-hot Serie A writing here. Here\u2019s a roundup of today\u2019s action on the continent. Here are the teams. It is early days but Inter\u2019s repurposing of Premier League cast-offs seems to be working out just fine. OK, that\u2019s harsh, since it was not too long ago that Antonio Conte was storming the Premier League with Chelsea. And in Italy, he is nothing close to being a reject; he is one of the country\u2019s most prolific active managers along with Massimiliano Allegri. In Romelu Lukaku, he has his man, the striker he wanted to sign before the Belgian was redirected to Manchester United. And Inter are top of the league, knocking Juventus off the perch for the first time in 552 days. Lukaku\u2019s impact on the field has been positive so far - the reaction to him on the terraces far less so - though he did struggle in the midweek 1-1 draw with Slavia Prague. Alexis Sanchez has been less productive, though a story in the Italian press suggests he backed up his old United buddy in a dressing-room fracas. But now for the first big test of the season, and AC Milan, a rival on harder times and flushed with rather less talent. Both have become also-rans in the era of Juve dominance. Perhaps the way back starts here. Perhaps not&gt; Kick-off: 7.45 pm BST",

With Labour\u2019s leadership still under pressure over its ambiguous position on Brexit, senior figures hope that announcing eye-catching policies can refocus a coming election on its plans for public services.</p> <p>The <em>Observer </em>also understands that the party is seriously considering a plan that would make care services for the over-65s free at the point of use, excluding accommodation costs.</p> <p>This would deal with the long-running crisis in social care, but may well require tax increases.</p> <p>Pledging to scrap Ofsted will cause huge debate. While some teaching unions have campaigned for the move, the inspectorate has denied a claim by Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, that it is biased against schools with more socially deprived intakes.</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Observer </em>today, Rayner said that England\u2019s schools inspectors were fuelling a crisis in teacher recruitment and failing to give parents an accurate account of school standards.</p> <p>\u201cWe would abolish Ofsted and we would replace it with a different system,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe Ofsted measures poverty. It measures deprivation. It doesn\u2019t measure excellence. And I think Ofsted has to measure excellence. It\u2019s driving these competitive league tables.</p> <p>\u201cI want parents to have confidence that regardless of where your child is educated or what your child\u2019s abilities are, they will get the best possible education. And at the moment the current Ofsted system does not measure that.\u201d</p> <p>She also pledged to roll out a national version of the London Challenge, an \u00a380m New Labour improvement programme credited with helping to improve the capital\u2019s secondary schools. It would be led by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-tax-business-national-education-service-labour-conference\" title=\"\">National Education Service</a> Labour has already pledged to create.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of seeing schools as competing with each other, they should be collaborating with each other, and teachers should be enabled and empowered to teach in the classroom,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the moment, they\u2019re not given the tools with which to do that. You can see that in a number of things \u2013 in the curriculum, in the way that teachers are leaving the profession at record levels. I believe that the whole system at the moment is a hothouse to pitch school against school.\u201d</p> <p>Rayner said Ofsted\u2019s rating system, which sees schools described as outstanding, good, requiring improvement or inadequate, did not give parents \u201ca clear understanding of what a school is and how good a school is\u201d.</p> <p>Under the Labour plan, Ofsted would be abolished and replaced with a \u201ctwo-phase\u201d inspection system. All education providers would be subjected to regular \u201chealth checks\u201d led by local authorities. Where concerns arose, more in-depth inspections would be conducted by specialists.</p> <p>Rayner said: \u201cCertainly some of the things that I\u2019ve been made aware of, when I\u2019ve gone round schools, is some of the gaming that goes on [during inspections]. There is no better judge of whether that school is right for your child [than] by actually physically going into the school and seeing whether the school environment is right for them. At the moment they\u2019ve been weaned off some of that.\u201d</p> <p>She said that handing inspections to another authority was not a rebadging exercise. \u201cWe\u2019re removing the high-stakes single-point testing that Ofsted are doing currently,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Labour is pledging to abolish Ofsted and end \u201chigh stakes\u201d school inspections as part of radical plans drawn up before a possible snap election. Announcements on education, health and care are expected to be at the heart of Labour\u2019s pitch to voters at its annual conference in Brighton this week. With Labour\u2019s leadership still under pressure over its ambiguous position on Brexit, senior figures hope that announcing eye-catching policies can refocus a coming election on its plans for public services. The Observer also understands that the party is seriously considering a plan that would make care services for the over-65s free at the point of use, excluding accommodation costs. This would deal with the long-running crisis in social care, but may well require tax increases. Pledging to scrap Ofsted will cause huge debate. While some teaching unions have campaigned for the move, the inspectorate has denied a claim by Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, that it is biased against schools with more socially deprived intakes. In an interview with the Observer today, Rayner said that England\u2019s schools inspectors were fuelling a crisis in teacher recruitment and failing to give parents an accurate account of school standards. \u201cWe would abolish Ofsted and we would replace it with a different system,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe Ofsted measures poverty. It measures deprivation. It doesn\u2019t measure excellence. And I think Ofsted has to measure excellence. It\u2019s driving these competitive league tables. \u201cI want parents to have confidence that regardless of where your child is educated or what your child\u2019s abilities are, they will get the best possible education. And at the moment the current Ofsted system does not measure that.\u201d She also pledged to roll out a national version of the London Challenge, an \u00a380m New Labour improvement programme credited with helping to improve the capital\u2019s secondary schools. It would be led by the National Education Service Labour has already pledged to create. \u201cInstead of seeing schools as competing with each other, they should be collaborating with each other, and teachers should be enabled and empowered to teach in the classroom,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the moment, they\u2019re not given the tools with which to do that. You can see that in a number of things \u2013 in the curriculum, in the way that teachers are leaving the profession at record levels. I believe that the whole system at the moment is a hothouse to pitch school against school.\u201d Rayner said Ofsted\u2019s rating system, which sees schools described as outstanding, good, requiring improvement or inadequate, did not give parents \u201ca clear understanding of what a school is and how good a school is\u201d. Under the Labour plan, Ofsted would be abolished and replaced with a \u201ctwo-phase\u201d inspection system. All education providers would be subjected to regular \u201chealth checks\u201d led by local authorities. Where concerns arose, more in-depth inspections would be conducted by specialists. Rayner said: \u201cCertainly some of the things that I\u2019ve been made aware of, when I\u2019ve gone round schools, is some of the gaming that goes on [during inspections]. There is no better judge of whether that school is right for your child [than] by actually physically going into the school and seeing whether the school environment is right for them. At the moment they\u2019ve been weaned off some of that.\u201d She said that handing inspections to another authority was not a rebadging exercise. \u201cWe\u2019re removing the high-stakes single-point testing that Ofsted are doing currently,\u201d she said. However, the party will face criticism that removing the rating system will mean parents will struggle to understand whether a school is good or bad. It means Labour is planning huge changes to the education system should it come to power. Jeremy Corbyn has already pledged that a Labour government would abolish Sats for seven- and 11-year-olds, as well as plans for baseline assessments for reception classes. It is also understood that John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, could announce that care for over-65s should be free. The move, similar to measures already in place in Scotland, would spare millions of people from high care costs. However, it would require billions in funding, potentially through higher tax. Labour refused to confirm that the policy would be announced, but said: \u201cLabour in government is committed to creating a national care service to ensure people are able to access the services so desperately needed.\u201d",

I\u2019m back from my relaxing break to Spain (worst storms in 40 years, flooding, high winds, broken corkscrew), and I\u2019m now ready to reject all further weekend invitations in favour of 12 weeks of sparkle-fuelled, sofa-based Strictly action.</p> <p>Tonight we\u2019ll see all 15 couples dance for the very first time, but with no public voting and nobody going home. However it\u2019s still worth our couples \u2018coming out and giving it their all\u2019 (drink) as the judges\u2019 scores carry over to next week.</p> <p>The liveblog format is splendidly simple: I\u2019ll follow all the dancefloor action up here, minute by minute, whilst you are cordially invited to add an extra sprinkling of glitz and sparkle down below. If you\u2019re a long-time lurker, please feel free to say hello and get involved. If you\u2019re liveblog glitterati, a warm welcome back for another year. If you have furious opinions about the Guardian providing commentary on a TV show you don\u2019t personally care for, please move along; that ship sailed a decade ago and we\u2019ve bought wine and snacks and everything. </p> <p>All the action kicks off at 7pm; according to the BBC website, tonight\u2019s show is an oddly specific 2 hours and 17 minutes long, so buckle up your dancing shoes for a marathon. See you at 7!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-21T12:37:58.960Z\">at 1.37pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s the end of the first Strictly live show! Lovely to be back in the swing of things, and thank you all for joining in \u2013 am off to read your comments and rest my tired fingers. No results show tomorrow, so I\u2019ll be back next Saturday for Week Two, and don\u2019t forget Rhik\u2019s GBBO liveblog on Tuesday if that\u2019s your slice of lemon drizzle. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens, so do come and say hello and share your prediction for this year\u2019s glitterball winner based on very limited evidence. See you next Saturday! Hx Leaderboard time! It\u2019s quite busy at the top and the bottom, with a few in the potential journey slot in the middle. Going to be an interesting series, I think. Scores: 6,6,5,6 - a total of 23 for Emma and Anton. Craig thought it was a bit laboured, not helped by how quick the dance was. Motsi loved Emma\u2019s posture, but it was a bit unbalanced in places. Shirley thought it was too heavy and the posture wasn\u2019t right for Jive, but otherwise quite nice. Bruno agrees there were a few issues, but a wonderful crowd-pleasing performance. This has a random supermarket theme, and Emma is actually wearing a Dinnerladies tabard. She has ridiculously long legs, and for the most part they are kicking and flicking in the right direction. It\u2019s a bit stompy in places and tentative in others, but nice work with Anton in hold. A good finish to a great season opener. And finally it\u2019s EMMA B AND ANTON! They\u2019re kicking off the season with a Jive to \u2018Honey Honey\u2019 by ABBA, because Emma used to play a character called Honey in Eastenders, so DRINK. In fact, drink everything you can find because I\u2019m not ready for an Anton Jive as the grand finale. Scores: 8,8,7,8 - a total of 31 for Karim and Amy. Bruno thought it was a tour de force of a performance, and Craig loved it even though there a lot of steps that didn\u2019t belong in the Cha Cha Cha. Motsi thought it was SO GOOD, and Shirley loved the timing, personality, musicality \u2013 all great for Week One. Karim is washing cars in Anneka\u2019s boiler suit, and has plenty of moves \u2013 good hip action, and great timing. All the club moves and moonwalking make it a bit soft for a Cha Cha Cha, but Karim can clearly dance and is going to give us plenty of entertainment over the coming weeks. NICE. Two to go! Stick with me, people. It\u2019s time for KARIN AND AMY! Their opening week dance is the Cha Cha Cha to \u2018If I Can\u2019t Have You\u2019 by Shawn Mendes. It\u2019s a perfect pop banger for the CBBC audience, and also the 40-something livebloggers who love a bit of Shawn Mendes. Karim showed some promising moves in the launch show a couple of weeks ago, so he\u2019s definitely a tip for the final. Also he\u2019s 19, which means he can maintain perky showbiz energy long after the rest of us have gone to bed with a peppermint tea. Scores: 5,7,7,7, - a total of 26 for Will and Janette. Shirley thought it was off the chart - great energy and a magnificent performance. Bruno thought Will\u2019s love of performance was clear, and the hard work paid off. Craig thought it was a bit frenetic, but he loved how they told the story. Motsi loved how Will gave energy a new definition. Love the personality and energy in this Quickstep \u2013 clear to see how hard Will has worked in training. This timing is pretty good and he and Janette make a great couple - a bit lacking control, but a great effort and looking forward to seeing more from these two. It\u2019s time for WILL AND JANETTE! Their first dance is the Quickstep to \u2018Pencil Full of Lead\u2019 by Paolo Nutini. This is usually a Charleston song, interested to see how it works as a Quickstep. I\u2019ve got high hopes for these two - looking forward to this. Scores: 3,4,3,4 - a total of 14 for Anneka and Kevin. Motsi loved how fearless Anneka was \u2013 she rocked that floor. Shirley thought it was very good for a non-dancer, but it needs time and work. Bruno thought there were a few wrong turns, but Anneka made it to the end. Craig thought it was flat-footed and stiff, but he thinks Anneka is secretly better than she\u2019s making out. SURE. It seems a bit harsh to make Anneka dance in a velour boiler suit in Week One, even if it does have a Treasure Hunt theme \u2013 drink in solidarity. Kevin is trying to act again, but thankfully Anneka soon gets off the ladder and puts him out of his misery. It feels a bit like an 80s breakfast TV workout, but I\u2019m enjoying the Dave Arch singers changing \u2018Gloria\u2019 for \u2018Anneka\u2019. FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS STRICTLY, STOP THE CLOCK. Next up it\u2019s ANNEKA AND KEVIN! Their first dance is the Cha Cha Cha to \u2018Gloria\u2019 by Laura Branigan. I love that they\u2019ve gone full 80s disco in Week One, it suggests that Anneka has no hoots to give and Kevin is expecting to be long gone by Halloween. I hope not, Anneka is one of the three I know. Scores: 7,7,8,8 - a total of 30 for Dev and Dianne. Craig thought it was elegant and graceful, and Motsi agrees \u2013 Dev made that look like a Sunday stroll with icecream in his hand. Shirley loved the musicality \u2013 the best ballroom footwork this evening. Bruno loved the quality and ease, tonight has been one surprise after another. Dev\u2019s in a DJ booth! DRINK! This Foxtrot is joyously nerdy and I love it \u2013 the footwork is actually pretty decent and they make a really nice couple. Dev\u2019s arms all go a bit awry out of hold but I\u2019m charmed nonetheless. It\u2019s time for DEV AND DIANNE! Their first dance is the Foxtrot to \u2018Build Me Up Buttercup\u2019 by The Foundations. I can\u2019t find any oblique DJ references here, but drink anyway because this is now a cheesy wedding with a free bar. Scores: 8,8,7,7 - a total of 30 for Michelle and Giovanni. Bruno thought it was clear, crisp and in focus \u2013 Michelle was absolutely selling it. Craig loved it, and Motsi loved the details, and \u2018I loved mamma\u2019. Shirley thought it had sass and elegance, and Michelle is going to eat Giovanni for lunch. OKAY. Michelle looks all kind of fierce and is giving it plenty of sass. Nice hip action, good control and bags of attitude \u2013 this is all I ask from a Cha Cha Cha and Michell is not disappointing. The timing all gets a bit wild towards the end but a great effort for Week One \u2013 LOVED that. Next up it\u2019s MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI! Their opening dance is a Cha Cha Cha to \u2018So Emotional\u2019 by Whitney Houston. The tabloids are already implying there is tension between these two, most likely in the absence of anything else to talk about. I love them both and really want this partnership to work. Also WHITNEY. What\u2019s not to love? Scores: 3,4,5,5 - a total of 17 for David and Nadiya. Wait, didn\u2019t Alex get 5s at the beginning of the show (several days ago) for being quite a lot better than that? As usual, the wheels are falling off the scoring half way through. Shirley points out that David is TALL (drink) and has great potential. Bruno was surprised that it wasn\u2019t a disaster, it was quite graceful and a proper Foxtrot. Craig wanted it to be a lot smoother and David went wrong in the middle, whilst Motsi wants David to find the harmony between his expression and his body \u2013 his dancing wasn\u2019t bad, but it needs to be more entertaining. Gutted they didn\u2019t give Three Lions to Emma W. and Aljaz. It could have had a safari park theme. Three lions in my park/monkeys on my windscreen/Thirty pounds for lunch/not including ice cream. Out comes David and Nadiya, in the worst outfits Strictly has seen in a while. They dance about awkwardly in a football goal, and whilst David\u2019s timing isn\u2019t bad, his footwork is sloppy and his giant hands appear to have a life of their own. But he caught the ball at the end, so that\u2019s something. A solid beginner effort for week one. Time for DAVID AND NADIYA! Their first dance is a Foxtrot to \u2018Three Lions\u2019 by Baddiel, Skinner and Lightning Seeds, because apparently oblique career references have now been replaced by being kicked in the ears with a 23-year-old football. DRINK. \u201cWe still have seven couples left to perform\u201d, says Claudia. Oh dear god. Scores: 8,8,8,8 - a total of 32. Gosh. Motsi has lost it over the booty pumping, she loved Kelvin\u2019s body line and hip action \u2013 so fun to watch. Shirley thought it was electrifying, and Kelvin was very much in touch with his feminine side \u2013 outstanding. Bruno needs his smelling salts \u2013 there was a chain reaction of hot flushes in the studio, and it was the best Samba he\u2019s seen on a debut show. Craig was bothered by Kelvin\u2019s hands, but it was amazing. Who was looking at his hands? Kelvin has sensibly kept his shirt on, in case he needs to take it off later on. It turns on that Kelvin has got hip action for DAYS and great timing. Loads of shimmy, bags of confidence, lots of authentic Samba moves. Those trousers are so tight they should be illegal, but really enjoyed that. Next up it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! Their opening dance is the Samba to \u2018La Vida Es Un Carnaval\u2019 by Celia Cruz. A week one Samba is quite a gutsy move, requiring Kelvin to unleash his hip action before people like me have got over him being that spotty kid in Emmerdale when I last watched 20 years ago. This could be incredible, or truly horrible. Or so horrible it\u2019s incredible. The Samba spectrum is broad. Scores: 2,3,3,3 - a total of 11 for James and Luba. Craig thought James\u2019 posture was bad \u2013 he was hunched over and his bottom was sticking out. Mostly it lacked everything. Motsi thought James was quite closed, he needs to open up and be more involved. Shirley agrees that it needs some work, but he didn\u2019t make any mistakes and probably inspired lots of men at home. Bruno thought it was VERY HARD FOR A MAN DRINK DRINK DRINK. Well Luba looks lovely, and James has a very nice suit on. But as Tango, it\u2019s a bit constipated. He look like an undertaker, and no amount of Luba spinning about can disguise his horrible posture. I\u2019m a sucker for a complete non-dancer with no natural talent so I declare this amazing. Who\u2019s next? It\u2019s JAMES AND LUBA! They\u2019re dancing the Tango to \u2018Gold\u2019 by Spandau Ballet, presumably because James won gold for the rowing thing (DRINK). He is very tall, and I fully expect one of the judges to mention it in passing. Scores: 5,5,4,5 - a total of 19 for Emma and Aljaz. Bruno thought Emma was underperforming in places which impacted her foot placement, but great potential. Craig agrees \u2013 needed more work in the legs and feet, but Emma has great rhythm. Motsi liked the ladylike feeling \u2013 it was really sexy but needed to be spiced up a bit. Shirley thought Emma looked stunning and her style is infectious, but needs more work on the technical skills. Emma is wearing a large hat, to indicate she\u2019s a lady. Also caf\u00e9 table \u2013 DRINK. Emma looks amazing but dancing is definitely not her forte \u2013 a bit tentative in places and wild in others. They look great together and Emma is clearly game, so hopefully Aljaz can bring out her inner dancefloor queen. Incidentally, the lyrics to this song should be sealed in a lead box and buried in the 1970s. \u201cShe\u2019s the kind they\u2019d like to flaunt and take to dinner/But she always knows her place\u201d. At the bar, Tom, paying for my own drinks and wondering when this dinner will end. Next up it\u2019s EMMA AND ALJAZ! Their first dance is a Cha Cha Cha to \u2018She\u2019s a Lady\u2019 by Tom Jones. I mean technically she\u2019s a Viscountess, but that doesn\u2019t really scan, so DRINK. In their VT, Emma takes AJ Aljaz for a tour round Longleat. It\u2019s not far from where I live, so I\u2019ve been lots of times. The addition of Aljaz to the safari park would definitely be an attraction. Scores: 4,6,6,6 - a total of 22 for Mike and Katya. Shirley loved some of the footwork and it was delightful. Bruno thought it was mad but he loved it, and there were some recognisable Jive steps in there. Craig thought Mike was like an overwound tin toy, but his footwork needs some work. Motsi was entertained in a very strange way, and she enjoyed it from beginning to end. I refuse to use the phrase \u2018dad dancing\u2019 as that would be unfair to every dad who ever graced a dancefloor. Mike is giving this both barrels but he\u2019s definitely this year\u2019s comedy turn \u2013 Katya has decided (possibly 10 minutes into first rehearsal) to make Mike the new Ed Balls. He\u2019s definitely got rhythm and some of the footwork is actually pretty decent, so not all is lost. Oh lord, we\u2019re only five couples down. Time for MIKE AND KATYA! Their first dance is the Jive to \u2018Do You Love Me\u2019 by The Contours. It\u2019s quite a big question for Katya to ask this early on, but probably best to get these things out in the open so there\u2019s no confusion later. Scores: 6,7,7,7 - a total of 27 for Saffron and AJ. Top of the leaderboard! Motsi loved it, as did Shirley \u2013 it was fabulous and Bruno can\u2019t wait for next week. Craig thought it was a bit Paso in the middle but great energy. Yep, there\u2019s Saffron on her phone, so tired already. It\u2019s quite fast for a Tango, and the music isn\u2019t really working for me. Footwork is great but Saffron\u2019s frame is a bit loose - incredible energy though, Saffron is NOT here to play. Meanwhile AJ is dressed like he\u2019s just fallen off his roadbike after getting his hair caught in the spokes. Anyway, enough of my moaning - next up it\u2019s SAFFRON AND AJ! Their first dance is the Tango to \u2018Lips Are Moving\u2019 by Meghan Trainor, which is a good song choice for the yoof fanbase. Also she talks about stuff on YouTube for a living, so DRINK. Last year Joe and Dianne did a social media-themed opening dance \u2013 the big* question is, will Saffron do the same? *ok, medium-sized. God this VT makes me feel old. Is it just me, or is everyone doing different dances make it incredibly hard to compare and score properly? I miss the days when they all used to do either a Waltz or a Cha Cha. This mishmash feels a bit ridiculous. Scores: 5,5,5,5 - a total of 20 for Catherine and Johannes. Craig thought the transitions were a bit bumpy and Catherine\u2019s head was a little high, but great potential. Motsi loved the atmosphere but Catherine needs to work on it looking a little more graceful. Shirley loved the choreography, and Catherine is going to be a force to be reckoned with. Bruno thought it started light and breezy, but it got a bit grippy and hoppy later on. Catherine and Johannes are on a hippy picnic, and I\u2019m already highly invested in this adorable couple. This is confident effort from Catherine \u2013 a bit rough in the footwork here and there but a decent top line for Week One. Nice work. It\u2019s time for CATHERINE AND JOHANNES! Their first dance is the Viennese Waltz to \u2018I Got You Babe\u2019 by Sonny and Cher. Oooh, a Johannes Viennesse in Week One \u2013 Strictly, you are already spoiling us. Scores: 3,4,3,3 - a total of 13 for Chris and Karen. Boo all you like, that was fair enough. The only way is up, right? Bruno thought it lacked timing and rhythm, but it had good entertainment value. Craig thought it was awkward and there was no hip action in sight, but somewhere deep down Chris has some rhythm. Motsi loved how Chris\u2019s face was having fun, but it needed more of that in the body. Shirley thought it had attitude and the partnership has great chemistry \u2013 with hard work anything is possible. Chris\u2019s shirt is quite alarming, but it\u2019s a good distraction from his horrible footwork. It\u2019s all quite stompy and there\u2019s no timing or hip action to speak of, but it\u2019s got bags of Saturday sass and that\u2019s all I\u2019m here for. Enjoyed that, don\u2019t @ me. Next up it\u2019s CHRIS AND KAREN! Their first dance is the Cha Cha Cha to \u2018Juice\u2019 by Lizzo \u2013 I salute Strictly for getting a Lizzo banger out so early on. Hope Chris is OK, because I\u2019ve heard that the Cha Cha Cha is a particularly difficult dance for a man. Scores: 5,5,5,6 - a total of 21 for Alex and Neil Shirley thought it was amazing choreography, and a decent effort despite a few footwork and frame issues. Bruno thought Alex has amazing potential, although she could have covered her mistakes better. Craig wanted cleaner footwork and the timing was out here and there. Motsi thought Alex started out a little shy, but warmed up - needs work on the presentation, but Alex is \u2018dangerous\u2019 (I think in a good way). Caf\u00e9 table! DRINK! Alex absolutely looks the part, and this is really not a bad Quickstep. Her shoulders are a little high but her footwork is (mostly) OK and her timing is (mostly) decent. Good effort for Week One, and lots of potential for these two. Right, let\u2019s get on with some dancing. First up tonight is ALEX AND NEIL! Their opening dance is a Quickstep to \u2018I Get a Kick Out of You\u2019 by Frank Sinatra, because football, see? DRINK. Am assuming that Neil getting a partner this year is his reward for retaining some level of dignity over the Pub Alley Paso last year \u2013 right now, this feels like a partnership that could go all the way to the final. We\u2019ll see. Out come the stars! Anneka has revived her 80s boiler suit, which is an early punishment from Wardrobe. Loving Shirley in a wedding dress and Motsi in black sparkly wings. I already have the biggest girl crush. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a scarlet pantsuit with boob studding, Claudia in black with one shoulder. Neither appear to fit very well, so it\u2019s a strong start to the new season. This is very glittery opening pro dance, and I\u2019m very much OK with this. Unleash the bacofoil and tatty yellow fringing, Strictly is BACK. And we\u2019re off! The opening sequence features lots of young people checking out Strictly on social media, because it\u2019s 2019 and if it\u2019s not on Instagram it didn\u2019t happen. First look at the credit sequence \u2013 who\u2019s going to annoy me this year with a cheesy thumbs aloft? Anneka making a break for it is a contender, but Will and Karen have the awkward fist bump so they\u2019re off my Christmas list. Loving the promo for RuPaul\u2019s UK Drag Race. Can I liveblog that too? It\u2019s time for the first proper Strictly Come Bingo of the year \u2013 take a swig of that rancid spirit you bought back from holiday for every occurrence of the following: Song choice/staging that awkwardly references the celebrity\u2019s career Mentions of tallness Any dance being difficult for a man A gap of 4 or more points between Craig and Bruno\u2019s scores. Early sightings of the Strictly caf\u00e9 tables/lamppost Evening all, and welcome back to another year of the Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! I\u2019m back from my relaxing break to Spain (worst storms in 40 years, flooding, high winds, broken corkscrew), and I\u2019m now ready to reject all further weekend invitations in favour of 12 weeks of sparkle-fuelled, sofa-based Strictly action. Tonight we\u2019ll see all 15 couples dance for the very first time, but with no public voting and nobody going home. However it\u2019s still worth our couples \u2018coming out and giving it their all\u2019 (drink) as the judges\u2019 scores carry over to next week. The liveblog format is splendidly simple: I\u2019ll follow all the dancefloor action up here, minute by minute, whilst you are cordially invited to add an extra sprinkling of glitz and sparkle down below. If you\u2019re a long-time lurker, please feel free to say hello and get involved. If you\u2019re liveblog glitterati, a warm welcome back for another year. If you have furious opinions about the Guardian providing commentary on a TV show you don\u2019t personally care for, please move along; that ship sailed a decade ago and we\u2019ve bought wine and snacks and everything. All the action kicks off at 7pm; according to the BBC website, tonight\u2019s show is an oddly specific 2 hours and 17 minutes long, so buckle up your dancing shoes for a marathon. See you at 7!",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump lashed back at his critics on Saturday, as questions swirled in the latest scandal to hit his White House and his target, Joe Biden, called for a congressional investigation of \u201can overwhelming abuse of power\u201d. \u201cNothing was said that was in any way wrong,\u201d Trump said of a phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which, according to the Wall Street Journal, the US president asked \u201cabout eight times\u201d that the Ukrainian leader investigate Biden\u2019s son. Biden is the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. His son Hunter was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice-president. Trump already faces impeachment inquiries but the Ukraine call is reported to be related to an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about the president\u2019s behaviour which is the subject of a standoff between the White House and Congress. Washington is abuzz. Did the US president use or attempt to use military aid to Ukraine as leverage in seeking the investigation of a political rival? Trump and Zelenskiy spoke on 25 July. About a month later, it was reported that $250m in military assistance to a country fighting Russian-backed separatists was being delayed after Trump requested a review. \u201cThe potentially most explosive issue here is whether the president essentially offered Ukraine a quid pro quo,\u201d Richard Pildes, professor of constitutional law at New York University, told the Guardian. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ll provide substantial US foreign aid if you provide damaging information concerning Joe Biden or his son.\u2019\u201d Republican claims about the Bidens and Ukraine concern a visit by the then vice-president in March 2016. The country\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired soon after: an aim of the US, allies, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which thought Shokin was turning a blind eye to corruption. An investigation into the company for which Hunter Biden worked was dormant at the time. In May this year, Ukraine prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko told Bloomberg News \u201cwe do not see any wrongdoing\u201d by the Bidens. On Saturday, Trump used Twitter to allege it. \u201cThe Fake News Media,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand their partner, the Democrat [sic] Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won\u2019t get a very large amount of US money, so they fabricate a story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine. \u201cNothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand \u2026 was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn\u2019t want to report!\u201d In the Oval Office on Friday, Trump was asked if he brought up Biden in his call with Zelenskiy. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed,\u201d he said, urging the media \u201cto look into\u201d Biden\u2019s background with Ukraine. Biden said that if the reports were true, \u201cthen there is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country\u201d. He also said Trump should release the transcript of his conversation with Zelenskiy. On Saturday, in Iowa, Biden said the House of Representatives should investigate what \u201cappears to be an overwhelming abuse of power\u201d. \u201cTo get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things \u2013 this is outrageous,\u201d Biden said with visible anger. \u201cTrump is using this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum and is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, used Trump\u2019s attack in fundraising appeals. The whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump\u2019s behaviour was filed on 12 August. The US intelligence inspector general called it \u201cserious\u201d and \u201curgent\u201d. On Friday Trump dismissed it, insisting \u201cit\u2019s nothing \u2026 just another political hack job\u201d. \u201cI have conversations with many leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always appropriate. Always appropriate. At the highest level always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country.\u201d But questions remain about Trump\u2019s view of Russia and relationship with Vladimir Putin, despite the conclusion of an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Special counsel Robert Mueller did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy but did lay out links between Trump aides and Russians and multiple instances of potential obstruction of justice. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and now backs separatists in the Donbass region. On Friday the Washington Post cited a former senior administration official who had \u201crepeatedly discussed the issue with Trump\u201d as saying the president thought military aid to Ukraine \u201cwas pointless and just aggravating the Russians\u201d. \u201cThe president\u2019s position basically is, we should recognize the fact that the Russians should be our friends, and who cares about the Ukrainians?\u201d the Post quoted the official as saying. Ukrainian foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko told Ukrainian outlet Hromadske his country was not interested in taking sides in US politics, but said Zelenskiy had the right to keep his \u201clong and friendly\u201d conversation with Trump secret. He also said US investigators had every right to uncover information, adding: \u201cI know what the conversation was about and I do not think there was any pressure.\u201d In New York next week, Trump and Zelenskiy will meet on the sidelines of the United Nations. In Washington, Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, has said he will go to court to get hold of the whistleblower complaint. On CNN on Thursday, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was asked if he asked Ukraine to look into Hunter Biden. He said, \u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t,\u201d but seconds later added: \u201cOf course I did.\u201d Trump was unaware of his actions, he said. On Saturday, the former New York mayor claimed on Twitter: \u201cSwamp Media been covering up Biden Family blatant trading on Joe\u2019s offices for years.\u201d",

I set it up in under five minutes\u201d. From October 2018 to June this year, Monzo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/25/monzo-digital-bank-doubles-value-2bn-fresh-funding-round-y-combinator\">doubled its valuation to \u00a32bn</a>, making it the second most valuable fin-tech startup in the UK.

I used to work on a big bank in my old job in Sydney and they used to trumpet features in their app that were clunky versions of what comes standard for Monzo.\u201d He cites \u201cthe real-time updates on spending, transfers and incoming money; the ability to send between friends instantly using just their name; the way you can use it in every European country with no fees\u201d and \u201cthe manner in which they speak to their customers\u201d (think: lots of emojis) as significant improvements on his Australian banking experiences.</p> <p>\u201cIt is almost like a little blessing amidst a world of difficulties,\u201d says Lexie Bucholtz, a 27-year-old Australian living in France, of her neobank <a href=\"https://n26.com/en-us\">N26</a>. The German company has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa5cea62-b9ac-11e9-8a88-aa6628ac896c\">3.5 million customers and a $3.5bn valuation</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s an app that has noticed our generation are starting to become fatigued by detailed technology with all the bells and whistles. We just want the simple stuff, and we want it now. Please.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We\u2019ve lost connectivity with our money\u2019</strong></h2> <p>\u201cOne of the big shifts in the last 10 years is we\u2019ve gone from having 30 transactions a month to 300 plus,\u201d says Travis Tyler, chief product and marketing manager of 86 400. \u201cThe way that we used to understand how much we\u2019ve spent is \u2018What do I have in my wallet at the end of the week?\u2019 But with everyone paying through tapping, paying with their phone or having money taken out through subscriptions, we\u2019ve lost connectivity with our money and what\u2019s going in and out.\u201d</p> <p>One of the key features of both Australian and international digital banks are notifications whenever you spend. While this feature is available on some traditional banks\u2019 apps too, it\u2019s not standard. It is, however, something users cite as important to their financial wellbeing. \u201cI have set up the notification feature, so I trust that everything is going to plan,\u201d says Bucholtz. \u201cEach time a transaction occurs, my phone buzzes. If there is no buzz, I assume everything is good to go.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/01/what-first-home-buyers-should-know-about-bank-of-mum-and-dad\">What first-home buyers should know about \u2018bank of mum and dad\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These notifications, alongside other seemingly small design features, such as brightly coloured debit cards, tally up to a banking experience that is engineered towards user enjoyment. The other key feature of neobanks is financial visibility \u2013 for instance, quickly viewing spending by category \u2013 and the ability to save in ways that make sense emotionally, rather than economically.</p> <p>With many neobanks you can partition your savings into multiple, separate buckets with labels such as \u201choliday\u201d and \u201cnew bike\u201d. </p> <p>Behind the scenes, neobanks are depending upon a lack of brick-and-mortar infrastructure as well as no cumbersome legacy technology to deliver banking cheaply. \u201cOur costs are very low and we\u2019re able to pass that on to customers,\u201d says Xinja CEO Eric Wilson. Before founding Xinja, Wilson worked for one of the big four banks. However, when Xinja starts offering loan products, probably early next year, he says their profit model will be different from the one Australians are used to and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/banking-royal-commission\">after the banking royal commission</a>, increasingly uncomfortable with. \u201cThe actual model of banking is sort of similar to the old Egyptians in that we take money in and we lend it out, and the difference between those two things is our margin.\u201d</p> <p>Xinja\u2019s viability is also dependent on virality. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly obvious, but if you look after your customers well, you treat them well and help them look after their money, they\u2019re more likely to stay with you,\u201d adds Xinja\u2019s Camilla Cooke. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to take out more products with you and they\u2019re more likely to recommend you to their friends. Certainly we\u2019ve seen that with neobanks in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>If users\u2019 in-app experience is good enough, it might work for some people, but not everyone is prepared to go digital only. \u201cWe have research that shows that about 30% of consumers would switch to a neobank,\u201d says Alison Banney, banking and finance editor at finder.com.au. \u201cBut 40% wouldn\u2019t. The main reason for that is the lack of a full product set, and a lack of bank managers. People really like to be able to walk into a branch and chat with someone if they need help. You can\u2019t do that with a neobank.\u201d</p> <p>While Bucholtz says her neobank works for her \u201csimple youth needs\u201d she is less certain about using them for more complex financial products like loans. \u201cIf my life rapidly changes and I need to take out a loan, or buy a house, I might stick with my traditional bank. I have an image of them being what is socially acceptable, or at least approved by my parents for that type of major investment. My parents would be suspicious of dealing with a neobank long term.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6143b90483fbb2b062e9a79cc5732b9da08f6473\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6143b90483fbb2b062e9a79cc5732b9da08f6473/0_0_768_960/400.jpg\" alt=\"Lexie Bucholtz stands in a vineyard outside a small French village.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lexie Bucholtz signed up for a neobank, N26, when she moved to France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both 86 400 and Xinja intend to roll out home loan products soon \u2013 it\u2019s how they\u2019re planning to make money. But Xinja insists it will never offer a credit card. \u201cThe only way you make money on those is when customers stuff up. That\u2019s not ethical,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cWe will make less money per customer probably than any other bank in this country. And I am absolutely fine with that \u2026 We want to make a bank that actually builds things alongside our customers. Which is what we do. We\u2019ve crowdfunded, we have them in the office every day. We want to make sure that the people who own us are actually the people who are going to use us.\u201d</p> <p>Sally Tindall, research director of Rate City, says it is too soon to tell whether neobanks can give Australians a better deal. \u201cNeobanks don\u2019t have many products... Until last week we really hadn\u2019t seen many rates being put on the table.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of savings, Up and 86 400 are very competitive in terms of this low rate environment. However, when it comes to transaction accounts, it\u2019s very hard to compete with the likes of ING, Macquarie and Me bank, who refund ATM fees domestically. ING even refund internationally. In that regard, they don\u2019t quite hit the high note.\u201d</p> <p>Even if slick design, smooth sign-up processes and competitive rates do lure customers to neobanks, it is too soon to tell whether their largely millennial customer base will be able to buy into their margin-making products. \u201cPerhaps the neobank is the bank of the future, moving away from the traditional, much like a lot of other aspects of life,\u201d Bucholtz muses. \u201cMy parents can stay with their traditional bank and I can move online. Why not?\u201d She laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that I will be able to afford a house anyway.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Know your neobank</strong></h2> <p>There are several new personal banking players on the market in Australia. All offer speedy sign-up (usually under two minutes) and no-fee accounts. Here\u2019s what sets each apart.</p> <p><strong>Up<br>Launched: </strong>October 2018<br><strong>The details: </strong>Up offers transactional and savings accounts, with a bonus rate of 2.5%, provided you make five transactions a month through your account. Owned by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Up is not a neobank, but it offers a mobile banking app with neobank-style features, like the ability to partition your savings and easily view spend-by-category in app. Up will also round up your purchases to the nearest dollar and put the remaining change in your savings account. They do not charge a fee for foreign currency conversions but do charge a $5 fee for overseas ATM use. Unlike some traditional banks, they do not refund ATM fees.</p> <p><strong>Revolut<br>Launched: </strong>June 2019<br><strong>The details: </strong>A UK-based neobank with permission to trade in Australia, Revolut offers transaction accounts and a slick, intuitive mobile banking app. Like Up, they offer customers the ability to round up their spare change and partition savings into several buckets. They do not offer interest on savings. Revolut\u2019s primary selling point is its no-fee ATM withdrawals (up to A$350), no-fee currency exchanges up to $9,000 and the ability to spend in foreign currencies at the interbank exchange rate. Revolut also offer a premium account, with a $10.99-a-month fee that offers no-fee international ATM withdrawals up to $700, unlimited no-fee currency exchanges and premium credit card-style perks like airport lounge access and a fancy-looking debit card.</p> <p><strong>86 400<br>Launched: </strong>September 2019<br><strong>The details: </strong>Backed by Cuscal, a transactional banking and asset management company, 86 400\u2019s primary biggest selling point is visibility over your finances. Their app predicts future recurring payments and connects with other financial institutions to offer a read-only view of all your finances in one place. 86 400 offer a bonus interest rate of 2.5% if you deposit at least $1,000 per month and charge a currency conversion fee of 1.5%.</p> <p><strong>Xinja<br>Launched: </strong>September 2019, to wait-list customers only<br><strong>The details: </strong>Xinja is Australia\u2019s first independent neobank focusing on personal banking, and they\u2019re partially financed through equity crowdfunding. At present they only offer transactional accounts. They charge no ATM fees, including for international ATM withdrawals, and no currency conversion fees.</p> <p><strong>Volt<br>Launched: </strong>Launch date TBC<br><strong>The details: </strong>Volt was the first independent Australian neobank to be awarded an authorised deposit-taking institution licence, in January of 2019.

      "bodyText": "Digital-only neobanks, offering no-fee accounts, high-speed sign-ups and intuitive user interfaces, are hoping to disrupt the way Australians save and spend their money \u2013 by making products people actually like. With names that sound like tech startups (or children\u2019s toys), optimistic branding palettes of aqua, violet and millennial pink, and websites that promise banking experiences that are \u201ceasy as \u2026 and fun\u201d, these financial upstarts have no interest in looking like their legacy peers, even when they\u2019re owned by them. Last week, two digital-only banks launched in Australia. On 9 September, Xinja was granted an authorised deposit-taking institution licence by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and immediately offered transactional accounts to some customers on its waiting list. Meanwhile 86 400 (the all-digits moniker comes from the number of seconds in a day), a new bank backed by transactional banking company Cuscal, launched its everyday and savings accounts to the public. Gaining a deposit-taking institution licence means that a new bank adheres to the same regulations and security checks as any other Australian bank, including the government-backed protection of customers\u2019 savings, up to a value of $250,000. These banks join Up, an app from Bendigo and Adelaide Banks that launched late last year; Judo, an SME-focused neobank; and Revolut, a British neobank with permission to operate in Australia on the digital banking landscape. There are more to come. Volt was granted a full banking licence in January and promises a spring launch on its website. While neobanks are new to Australia, they\u2019re a fast-growing category abroad. \u201cI was really sweating setting up a bank account in the UK,\u201d says Australian Jonno Seidler, 32, who currently lives in London. \u201cI\u2019d read all about the horror stories of high street banks that only let you open an account if you had a proof of address and utilities bills, which is obviously impossible for a newcomer.\u201d Instead, he signed up for a neobank, Monzo, and found the process \u201cstupendously simple. I set it up in under five minutes\u201d. From October 2018 to June this year, Monzo doubled its valuation to \u00a32bn, making it the second most valuable fin-tech startup in the UK. With a rapidly growing customer base of 2.5 million, the company has earned a cult fan following. Seidler is among them. \u201cI spend a lot more time looking at my banking app now ... it can do a lot more. I used to work on a big bank in my old job in Sydney and they used to trumpet features in their app that were clunky versions of what comes standard for Monzo.\u201d He cites \u201cthe real-time updates on spending, transfers and incoming money; the ability to send between friends instantly using just their name; the way you can use it in every European country with no fees\u201d and \u201cthe manner in which they speak to their customers\u201d (think: lots of emojis) as significant improvements on his Australian banking experiences. \u201cIt is almost like a little blessing amidst a world of difficulties,\u201d says Lexie Bucholtz, a 27-year-old Australian living in France, of her neobank N26. The German company has 3.5 million customers and a $3.5bn valuation. \u201cIt\u2019s an app that has noticed our generation are starting to become fatigued by detailed technology with all the bells and whistles. We just want the simple stuff, and we want it now. Please.\u201d \u2018We\u2019ve lost connectivity with our money\u2019 \u201cOne of the big shifts in the last 10 years is we\u2019ve gone from having 30 transactions a month to 300 plus,\u201d says Travis Tyler, chief product and marketing manager of 86 400. \u201cThe way that we used to understand how much we\u2019ve spent is \u2018What do I have in my wallet at the end of the week?\u2019 But with everyone paying through tapping, paying with their phone or having money taken out through subscriptions, we\u2019ve lost connectivity with our money and what\u2019s going in and out.\u201d One of the key features of both Australian and international digital banks are notifications whenever you spend. While this feature is available on some traditional banks\u2019 apps too, it\u2019s not standard. It is, however, something users cite as important to their financial wellbeing. \u201cI have set up the notification feature, so I trust that everything is going to plan,\u201d says Bucholtz. \u201cEach time a transaction occurs, my phone buzzes. If there is no buzz, I assume everything is good to go.\u201d These notifications, alongside other seemingly small design features, such as brightly coloured debit cards, tally up to a banking experience that is engineered towards user enjoyment. The other key feature of neobanks is financial visibility \u2013 for instance, quickly viewing spending by category \u2013 and the ability to save in ways that make sense emotionally, rather than economically. With many neobanks you can partition your savings into multiple, separate buckets with labels such as \u201choliday\u201d and \u201cnew bike\u201d. Behind the scenes, neobanks are depending upon a lack of brick-and-mortar infrastructure as well as no cumbersome legacy technology to deliver banking cheaply. \u201cOur costs are very low and we\u2019re able to pass that on to customers,\u201d says Xinja CEO Eric Wilson. Before founding Xinja, Wilson worked for one of the big four banks. However, when Xinja starts offering loan products, probably early next year, he says their profit model will be different from the one Australians are used to and, after the banking royal commission, increasingly uncomfortable with. \u201cThe actual model of banking is sort of similar to the old Egyptians in that we take money in and we lend it out, and the difference between those two things is our margin.\u201d Xinja\u2019s viability is also dependent on virality. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly obvious, but if you look after your customers well, you treat them well and help them look after their money, they\u2019re more likely to stay with you,\u201d adds Xinja\u2019s Camilla Cooke. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to take out more products with you and they\u2019re more likely to recommend you to their friends. Certainly we\u2019ve seen that with neobanks in the UK.\u201d If users\u2019 in-app experience is good enough, it might work for some people, but not everyone is prepared to go digital only. \u201cWe have research that shows that about 30% of consumers would switch to a neobank,\u201d says Alison Banney, banking and finance editor at finder.com.au. \u201cBut 40% wouldn\u2019t. The main reason for that is the lack of a full product set, and a lack of bank managers. People really like to be able to walk into a branch and chat with someone if they need help. You can\u2019t do that with a neobank.\u201d While Bucholtz says her neobank works for her \u201csimple youth needs\u201d she is less certain about using them for more complex financial products like loans. \u201cIf my life rapidly changes and I need to take out a loan, or buy a house, I might stick with my traditional bank. I have an image of them being what is socially acceptable, or at least approved by my parents for that type of major investment. My parents would be suspicious of dealing with a neobank long term.\u201d Both 86 400 and Xinja intend to roll out home loan products soon \u2013 it\u2019s how they\u2019re planning to make money. But Xinja insists it will never offer a credit card. \u201cThe only way you make money on those is when customers stuff up. That\u2019s not ethical,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cWe will make less money per customer probably than any other bank in this country. And I am absolutely fine with that \u2026 We want to make a bank that actually builds things alongside our customers. Which is what we do. We\u2019ve crowdfunded, we have them in the office every day. We want to make sure that the people who own us are actually the people who are going to use us.\u201d Sally Tindall, research director of Rate City, says it is too soon to tell whether neobanks can give Australians a better deal. \u201cNeobanks don\u2019t have many products... Until last week we really hadn\u2019t seen many rates being put on the table.\u201d \u201cIn terms of savings, Up and 86 400 are very competitive in terms of this low rate environment. However, when it comes to transaction accounts, it\u2019s very hard to compete with the likes of ING, Macquarie and Me bank, who refund ATM fees domestically. ING even refund internationally. In that regard, they don\u2019t quite hit the high note.\u201d Even if slick design, smooth sign-up processes and competitive rates do lure customers to neobanks, it is too soon to tell whether their largely millennial customer base will be able to buy into their margin-making products. \u201cPerhaps the neobank is the bank of the future, moving away from the traditional, much like a lot of other aspects of life,\u201d Bucholtz muses. \u201cMy parents can stay with their traditional bank and I can move online. Why not?\u201d She laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that I will be able to afford a house anyway.\u201d Know your neobank There are several new personal banking players on the market in Australia. All offer speedy sign-up (usually under two minutes) and no-fee accounts. Here\u2019s what sets each apart. Up Launched: October 2018 The details: Up offers transactional and savings accounts, with a bonus rate of 2.5%, provided you make five transactions a month through your account. Owned by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Up is not a neobank, but it offers a mobile banking app with neobank-style features, like the ability to partition your savings and easily view spend-by-category in app. Up will also round up your purchases to the nearest dollar and put the remaining change in your savings account. They do not charge a fee for foreign currency conversions but do charge a $5 fee for overseas ATM use. Unlike some traditional banks, they do not refund ATM fees. Revolut Launched: June 2019 The details: A UK-based neobank with permission to trade in Australia, Revolut offers transaction accounts and a slick, intuitive mobile banking app. Like Up, they offer customers the ability to round up their spare change and partition savings into several buckets. They do not offer interest on savings. Revolut\u2019s primary selling point is its no-fee ATM withdrawals (up to A$350), no-fee currency exchanges up to $9,000 and the ability to spend in foreign currencies at the interbank exchange rate. Revolut also offer a premium account, with a $10.99-a-month fee that offers no-fee international ATM withdrawals up to $700, unlimited no-fee currency exchanges and premium credit card-style perks like airport lounge access and a fancy-looking debit card. 86 400 Launched: September 2019 The details: Backed by Cuscal, a transactional banking and asset management company, 86 400\u2019s primary biggest selling point is visibility over your finances. Their app predicts future recurring payments and connects with other financial institutions to offer a read-only view of all your finances in one place. 86 400 offer a bonus interest rate of 2.5% if you deposit at least $1,000 per month and charge a currency conversion fee of 1.5%. Xinja Launched: September 2019, to wait-list customers only The details: Xinja is Australia\u2019s first independent neobank focusing on personal banking, and they\u2019re partially financed through equity crowdfunding. At present they only offer transactional accounts. They charge no ATM fees, including for international ATM withdrawals, and no currency conversion fees. Volt Launched: Launch date TBC The details: Volt was the first independent Australian neobank to be awarded an authorised deposit-taking institution licence, in January of 2019. Their first products are slated to launch in spring of 2019. The Australian Banking Association was contacted for comment for this article.",

I wanted to talk to Centrelink.\u201d</p> <p>The Brisbane woman says she was forced to collect as many payslips as she could, but that proved difficult. The best she could do was gather old bank statements and submit them to Centrelink.</p> <p>In February the agency said she owed them $4,500. After a review on the phone, it was $150.

The firm asked people to register their interest before it selects a test case and about 1,200 people had made contact in the first 24 hours.</p> <p>\u201cWe think there is a strong legal basis and a strong factual basis [to proceed],\u201d the firm\u2019s senior partner, Peter Gordon, said this week.</p> <p>The class action came about after Shorten contacted the law firm. Labor was critical of the program in opposition, particularly Shorten who made reference to it during the campaign. But Labor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/08/labor-not-revealing-position-on-robotdebt-scheme-despite-attacking-coalition\">declined to promise to scrap the program</a>.</p> <p>Shortly after the new parliament convened, Shorten, now the opposition\u2019s spokesman for government services, took some by surprise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/30/labor-calls-on-government-to-scrap-malfunctioning-robodebt-scheme\">when he called for the government to scrap the scheme</a>.</p> <p>\u201cRobodebt is very likely illegal,\u201d Shorten said this week. \u201cThe scheme - including its reverse onus of proof \u2013 is at best legally dubious and should rightly have its legality determined by a court. It is right that this action be pursued by the lawyer who pursued justice in David and Goliath battles with Big Tobacco and Big Pharma.\u201d</p> <p>The class action <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/06/centrelink-wipes-robodebt-in-second-case-set-to-challenge-legality-of-scheme\">follows a separate federal court challenge by Victoria Legal Aid</a>, which also argues that the use of Australian Taxation Office data-matching to substantiate whether a person was overpaid their income support is unlawful.</p> <p>The way it works is that Centrelink will average a person\u2019s yearly income over the welfare recipient\u2019s fortnightly income reporting periods to calculate whether a debt is owed.</p> <p>This methods have long been criticised by welfare and legal groups, as well as grassroots campaigners such as the NotMyDebt group, but the government argues it is the responsibility of the welfare recipient to clear up any potential discrepancy by providing payslips and other evidence to allow for a more accurate calculation.</p> <p>Critics say the process wrongly places the onus on people to prove they do not owe a debt, which can date back as much as seven years. The NotMyDebt campaign, which helps people take on the system, says the spectre of a class action is not an \u201cinstant fix\u201d.</p> <p>Still, many people caught up in the robodebt scheme expressed delight at news of the class action. Some said it gave them a sense of hope.</p> <p>A Canberra woman, Jules Bray, 50, says she is considering taking part in the class action.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/06/centrelink-wipes-robodebt-in-second-case-set-to-challenge-legality-of-scheme\">Centrelink drops woman's robodebt in second case set to challenge legality of scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2017, Bray was forced to battle Centrelink over a $1,700 debt. \u201cI was not allowed to see anyone face to face to talk about this,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to go into Centrelink offices. \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t have anyone qualified to talk about that. You have to contact the department, you can only talk to them over the phone.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd it was the most maddening experience trying to explain \u2026 They absolutely flat-out refused to see my rationale.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, the figure was reduced to a few hundred dollars and automatically taken out of Bray\u2019s income support payments. Critics say more vulnerable welfare recipients end up paying debts they may not owe without challenge.</p> <p>The government services minister, Stuart Robert, has accused Shorten of a \u201cstunt\u201d and said Labor wanted to give hundreds of thousands of Australians \u201ca leave pass\u201d without saying where the lost revenue would come from.</p> <p>He said data-matching had begun under Labor while Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek were the responsible ministers.</p> <p>The former Labor government did introduce the process, but it was carried out on a much smaller scale, with significantly more human involvement.</p> <p>The Coalition turbocharged the scheme in 2016, increasing the number of \u201ccompliance interventions\u201d from 20,000 a year to 20,000 a week.</p> <p>Despite her tax return taken, Wheeler believes she is one of the lucky ones. \u201cIt\u2019s important for people who are in less fortunate position than me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a native Australian speaker, I have a well-paying permanent job, and it\u2019s been difficult for me. I feel terrible for anyone who may have barriers.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who don\u2019t have access to the same level of communication, the internet or email, I just have no idea how they would fight a debt from Centrelink.</p> <p>\u201cI actually think it\u2019s a human rights issue.\u201d</p>",

The firm asked people to register their interest before it selects a test case and about 1,200 people had made contact in the first 24 hours. \u201cWe think there is a strong legal basis and a strong factual basis [to proceed],\u201d the firm\u2019s senior partner, Peter Gordon, said this week. The class action came about after Shorten contacted the law firm. Labor was critical of the program in opposition, particularly Shorten who made reference to it during the campaign. But Labor declined to promise to scrap the program. Shortly after the new parliament convened, Shorten, now the opposition\u2019s spokesman for government services, took some by surprise when he called for the government to scrap the scheme. \u201cRobodebt is very likely illegal,\u201d Shorten said this week. \u201cThe scheme - including its reverse onus of proof \u2013 is at best legally dubious and should rightly have its legality determined by a court. It is right that this action be pursued by the lawyer who pursued justice in David and Goliath battles with Big Tobacco and Big Pharma.\u201d The class action follows a separate federal court challenge by Victoria Legal Aid, which also argues that the use of Australian Taxation Office data-matching to substantiate whether a person was overpaid their income support is unlawful. The way it works is that Centrelink will average a person\u2019s yearly income over the welfare recipient\u2019s fortnightly income reporting periods to calculate whether a debt is owed. This methods have long been criticised by welfare and legal groups, as well as grassroots campaigners such as the NotMyDebt group, but the government argues it is the responsibility of the welfare recipient to clear up any potential discrepancy by providing payslips and other evidence to allow for a more accurate calculation. Critics say the process wrongly places the onus on people to prove they do not owe a debt, which can date back as much as seven years. The NotMyDebt campaign, which helps people take on the system, says the spectre of a class action is not an \u201cinstant fix\u201d. Still, many people caught up in the robodebt scheme expressed delight at news of the class action. Some said it gave them a sense of hope. A Canberra woman, Jules Bray, 50, says she is considering taking part in the class action. In 2017, Bray was forced to battle Centrelink over a $1,700 debt. \u201cI was not allowed to see anyone face to face to talk about this,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried to go into Centrelink offices. \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t have anyone qualified to talk about that. You have to contact the department, you can only talk to them over the phone.\u2019 \u201cAnd it was the most maddening experience trying to explain \u2026 They absolutely flat-out refused to see my rationale.\u201d Eventually, the figure was reduced to a few hundred dollars and automatically taken out of Bray\u2019s income support payments. Critics say more vulnerable welfare recipients end up paying debts they may not owe without challenge. The government services minister, Stuart Robert, has accused Shorten of a \u201cstunt\u201d and said Labor wanted to give hundreds of thousands of Australians \u201ca leave pass\u201d without saying where the lost revenue would come from. He said data-matching had begun under Labor while Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek were the responsible ministers. The former Labor government did introduce the process, but it was carried out on a much smaller scale, with significantly more human involvement. The Coalition turbocharged the scheme in 2016, increasing the number of \u201ccompliance interventions\u201d from 20,000 a year to 20,000 a week. Despite her tax return taken, Wheeler believes she is one of the lucky ones. \u201cIt\u2019s important for people who are in less fortunate position than me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a native Australian speaker, I have a well-paying permanent job, and it\u2019s been difficult for me. I feel terrible for anyone who may have barriers. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t have access to the same level of communication, the internet or email, I just have no idea how they would fight a debt from Centrelink. \u201cI actually think it\u2019s a human rights issue.\u201d",

It\u2019s an in-depth, behind-the-scenes handbook about how people can (and must) use their collective power to force even the most hostile, hamstrung government to deliver reforms. Whether you care for marriage equality or not, How Powerful We Are reveals how decisions are made in this country, how communities can influence them and how ordinary people can make extraordinary change.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Is this some sort of mean joke?

Only writing!</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>I am approaching the end of Niki Savva\u2019s Plots and Prayers, the story of how Scott Morrison took the Australian prime ministership.

It begins with survivors of the Vietnam war, both in Vietnam and beyond. There is a double-amputee, a homeless veteran selling lottery tickets in Saigon. There\u2019s a brother and sister trying to settle in to Melbourne after escaping Vietnam by boat. The stories then find connections with people from the Nepalese civil war, the Argentine dirty war, and a migrant worker\u2019s journey from Zanzibar to the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>These are stories of people who are usually marginalised, who we don\u2019t often hear from. Against the background of war and suffering, I focused on what makes each character\u2019s world come most alive. The stories centre on who they love, their sweetest memories, and greatest hopes.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Clarice Lispector\u2019s The Hour of the Star made me think deeply about how fiction portrays people who are marginalised and usually excluded from literature. Even when they are portrayed, what does it mean if they will not read that literature?</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>A Constant Hum by Alice Bishop by all accounts is a fantastic debut book of short stories about the Black Saturday bushfires.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Josephine Rowe<br></strong><em><strong>Here Until August</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Black Inc.</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"253cad131d1a0b6222f06cc3cfada588b7075495\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/253cad131d1a0b6222f06cc3cfada588b7075495/0_0_520_809/321.jpg\" alt=\"Here Until August, by Josephine Rowe.\" width=\"321\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Here Until August, by Josephine Rowe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Black Inc.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tell us about your book. </strong>Here Until August is a collection of stories following characters who are navigating \u2013 usually un-heroically \u2013 the interlude between a familiar way of living, and a life yet to come. Geographical transience is a common thread among the stories, whether through choice or outright displacement, and the narrators are often far from home, either pressing forward into indeterminate futures, or seeking their way back to the known, occasionally returning to places or circumstances that have become unrecognisable or estranging.</p> <p>The collection shifts between Australia, Canada and the United States, reaching back into other remembered homelands. Stories unfold above submerged townships, in backwoods cabins, remote stretches of highway, anonymous hotels or the borrowed rooms of absent strangers. It\u2019s a book about distances, homesickness, and internal and external borders.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>The collection was written over seven years and several countries so I was impacted by countless books in that time, but if forced to choose one (agony!) it\u2019s Lucia Berlin\u2019s A Manual for Cleaning Women. Berlin\u2019s is a great, wry humanity and a razor-sharp wit honed by lived insight into many contradictory facets of life.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>On Drugs, philosopher Chris Fleming\u2019s memoir on addiction. I\u2019ve heard several nuanced raves about it from people whose minds I admire, including those who\u2019ve lived with compulsion in one form or another.

Fascinated by caves and underground, he grows up in a world affected by mining \u2013 far away, but close, too. As an adult he goes through the Earth\u2019s crust into Hollow Earth, where he finds a genderless society based on equality and fairness that values environment more than consumer technologies. Finding Ari and Zest, he guides them to the Surface, where they are confronted by horrific rapacity yet also grow quickly addicted to its ways. Searching for an entry back into Hollow Earth, they wander. In a future storyline, the Underworlders \u2013 miners who have discovered Hollow Earth \u2013 break through and plunder and destroy, extracting all they can to feed the surface world.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Jules Verne\u2019s Journey to the Centre of the Earth (also with the first film version of this), and other \u201chollow earth\u201d works, especially William R Bradshaw\u2019s colonialist Goddess of Atvatabar. Hollow Earth is a rejection of these works\u2019 values, but also a departure from, and at times dialogue with, their phantasms.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>I\u2019ve actually already given it a read through but am about to read again Charmaine Papertalk Green\u2019s intense and astonishing Nganajungu Yagu. To quote the poet from the preface, the book \u201cwas inspired by mother\u2019s letters, her life and the love she instilled in me for my people and my culture\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Lucy Treloar<br></strong><em><strong>Wolfe Island</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Picador</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4034cec8fcaaa33a173c36dec9572ed6d0af722b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4034cec8fcaaa33a173c36dec9572ed6d0af722b/0_0_1821_2753/661.jpg\" alt=\"Wolfe Island, by Lucy Treloar.\" width=\"661\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wolfe Island, by Lucy Treloar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Picador</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tell us about your book. </strong>Kitty Hawke is the last inhabitant of an island that\u2019s eroding into the windswept Chesapeake Bay. Kept company by her wolfdog and her ghostly memories of the island\u2019s past, she spends her days creating sculptures from the wreckage she finds, until one stormy night her granddaughter and some friends blow ashore, desperate and seeking sanctuary from a world turning bad. Despite her fiercely protected solitude, Kitty can\u2019t turn them away. Soon trouble follows them and like others they flee north towards sanctuary.</p> <p>Part myth, part western, Wolfe Island is set in the nearest of futures in a world that is rapidly changing. What would we each do if we lost the security we take for granted? Would we cling to our drives for love, freedom and belonging? Like countless others, Kitty must discover what she will do to save the people she loves, and where they can find a new home.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Denis Johnson\u2019s Train Dreams is a kind of miracle, which I returned to often while writing. Its almost flat tone, despite the events it recounts, creates a mood of unsettling surreality. Johnson is a wonderful observer of people\u2019s adaptability, including to the feverish pace of the \u201cconquest\u201d of the west, the bookend of which \u2013 its ruin \u2013 appears in Wolfe Island.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>I\u2019ve just started Molly Murn\u2019s Heart of the Grass Tree \u2013 an evocative novel set on Kangaroo Island \u2013 and I feel in wonderfully sure hands. It\u2019s a story of family, first contact between the Ngarrindjeri people and European sealers, and the way history reverberates in the present \u2013 rich material about a region I love.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>White Tears/Brown Scars<br></strong><em><strong>Ruby Hamad</strong></em><strong><br><sub>MUP</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b22d4fedb945cddf022cb22a09f62c19ed910b75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b22d4fedb945cddf022cb22a09f62c19ed910b75/0_0_1925_2882/668.jpg\" alt=\"White Tears, Brown Scars, a new book by Ruby Hamad which is out 1 September through Melbourne University Press.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White Tears, Brown Scars, a new book by Ruby Hamad which is out 1 September through Melbourne University Press.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MUP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tell us about your book. </strong>White Tears/Brown Scars is primarily two things. First, it\u2019s a deep dive into the construction of race and gender in settler-colonial societies. Old archetypes of racialised women as \u201cbad Arabs\u201d and \u201cblack Jezebels\u201d and \u201cChina dolls\u201d were created in order to create a binary between women of colour and the \u201cwhite damsel\u201d and these representations shape our contemporary world in a far greater way than is realised. Women are all too often treated as a footnote in history whereas their role and status were pivotal to the development of western society.</p> <p>Second, it is a long overdue validation of the experiences of women of colour whose gendered racialisation results not only in marginalisation and discrimination but in further blame whenever they try to shed light on their mistreatment. Women of colour are repeatedly traumatised in ways society just does not even acknowledge and the impacts on our health and happiness is astronomical.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>I was already familiar with much of the research I cite in my book but I discovered The Biopolitics of Feeling by Kyla Schuller while writing and it was like the proverbial missing link. I\u2019d been attempting to articulate exactly how and why the white damsel archetype reinforces the system of white supremacy and Schuller\u2019s analysis of 19th century race science reveals that womanhood and femininity were racialised concepts used to fuel colonialism\u2019s domination.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>Between the book and PhD, my reading has been mostly confined to research so with a little spare time up my sleeve at long last I\u2019m excited to be reading fiction again! Top of my list is The Pillars by Peter Polites. Polites has such an intimate understanding of how race and sex are played off against each other in our society; of how sexuality (much like gender) is a form and function of power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jane Gilmore<br></strong><em><strong>Fixed It</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Viking</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f0ffbaaad36048f357a192519ee17fd000418134\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0ffbaaad36048f357a192519ee17fd000418134/0_0_1799_2764/651.jpg\" alt=\"Fixed It: violence and the representation of women in the media, a book by Australian author and journalist Jane Gilmore which is out through Penguin Random House in September 2019.\" width=\"651\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fixed It: violence and the representation of women in the media, a book by Australian author and journalist Jane Gilmore which is out through Penguin Random House in September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tell us about your book. </strong>Fixed It is the book I wrote to explain why the media is so often unable to report on women\u2019s lives as valuable, or violent men\u2019s choices as their own responsibility. After four years of taking a red pen to terrible headlines and rewriting them for a social media audience I thought the project needed more thought than just showing what was happening. I needed to understand and explain the who, why and how as well.</p> <p>Although the focus of the Fixed It project is media reporting of men\u2019s violence against women, the book takes a wider, more complex view. It explores how the myths about violence that blame victims and excuse perpetrators permeate all the structures of our lives, from politics to sport, business, pop culture, education and academia. Journalism is often the conduit of information between those structures and the public, so when it ignores the perspective of half the population it\u2019s only fulfilling half its function. Fixed It examines how this happens and what we can do to change it.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>When Men Murder Women by R Emerson Dobash and Russell P Dobash. They reviewed 866 homicide case files and 200 in-depth interviews with murderers in prison. It\u2019s one of the most detailed studies I could find of men who kill women, why they did it, how they view it and how their childhood connected to the crimes they committed as adults. We can\u2019t change a problem we don\u2019t understand and this book goes a long way to providing some insight into what happens to men to bring them to the point that they believe they are entitled to take a life.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>The Revolution of Man by Phil Barker. I\u2019ve skimmed it but I want to read it properly because the myths of what manhood should be do so much harm and I think Phil explores this and explains it in ways that give hope to men struggling to be what they want to be rather than what they were told they had to be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Gabrielle Jackson<br><em>Pain and Prejudice</em><br><sub>Allen &amp; Unwin</sub></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aa33a5d33940ae96e6e741c585d403c904233f41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa33a5d33940ae96e6e741c585d403c904233f41/0_0_1807_2764/654.jpg\" alt=\"Pain and Prejudice: A Call to Arms for Women and their Bodies, by Guardian Australia journalist and editor Gabrielle Jackson.\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pain and Prejudice: A Call to Arms for Women and their Bodies, by Guardian Australia journalist and editor Gabrielle Jackson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allen and Unwin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tell us about your book. </strong>My book is primarily about women\u2019s pain and how society at once tells us it is part of women\u2019s lot to be in pain, but also dismisses women when they say they are in pain. Studies show that women experience more intense pain and for longer periods than men but are less likely to have their pain treated than men. We know that 70% of chronic pain patients are women but 80% of pain medication has been tested on men or male mice. We also know that pain is processed differently in men and women, so that if drugs are only being tested on men, they may not work on women. My book takes a big-picture look at women and pain and the real-life consequences of ignoring it.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Come As You Are by Emily Nagoksi, Doing Harm by Maya Dusenbery, Inferior by Angela Saini and Down Girl by Kate Manne. Each of these books took my book in new directions and helped me plumb new depths, firmly situating women\u2019s pain in patriarchal structures and helping me to explain why we ignore the pain of women, people of colour and gender-diverse people.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>On my bedside table ready to start this weekend I have Dr Nikki Stamp\u2019s book Pretty Unhealthy: Why our obsession with looking healthy is making us sick. I interviewed Stamp for Pain and Prejudice.

      "bodyText": "Sally Rugg How Powerful We Are Hachette Tell us about your book. How Powerful We Are is a story of dirty politics, sophisticated campaigning, raw personal tales and the historic social movement that achieved marriage equality. It\u2019s an in-depth, behind-the-scenes handbook about how people can (and must) use their collective power to force even the most hostile, hamstrung government to deliver reforms. Whether you care for marriage equality or not, How Powerful We Are reveals how decisions are made in this country, how communities can influence them and how ordinary people can make extraordinary change. What were you reading while you wrote it? Is this some sort of mean joke? Will you next ask which wineries I toured and which tropical beaches I languished upon? There was no time for reading! Only writing! What will you read next? I am approaching the end of Niki Savva\u2019s Plots and Prayers, the story of how Scott Morrison took the Australian prime ministership. My book covers in detail how marriage equality led to the spectacular downfall of both Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, so Savva\u2019s story feels like a (far more advanced) continuation of this government\u2019s thrills and spills \u2013 and spills. Joey Bui Lucky Ticket Text Tell us about your book. Lucky Ticket is a collection of short stories based on interviews with migrants around the world. It begins with survivors of the Vietnam war, both in Vietnam and beyond. There is a double-amputee, a homeless veteran selling lottery tickets in Saigon. There\u2019s a brother and sister trying to settle in to Melbourne after escaping Vietnam by boat. The stories then find connections with people from the Nepalese civil war, the Argentine dirty war, and a migrant worker\u2019s journey from Zanzibar to the United Arab Emirates. These are stories of people who are usually marginalised, who we don\u2019t often hear from. Against the background of war and suffering, I focused on what makes each character\u2019s world come most alive. The stories centre on who they love, their sweetest memories, and greatest hopes. What were you reading while you wrote it? Clarice Lispector\u2019s The Hour of the Star made me think deeply about how fiction portrays people who are marginalised and usually excluded from literature. Even when they are portrayed, what does it mean if they will not read that literature? What will you read next? A Constant Hum by Alice Bishop by all accounts is a fantastic debut book of short stories about the Black Saturday bushfires. Josephine Rowe Here Until August Black Inc. Tell us about your book. Here Until August is a collection of stories following characters who are navigating \u2013 usually un-heroically \u2013 the interlude between a familiar way of living, and a life yet to come. Geographical transience is a common thread among the stories, whether through choice or outright displacement, and the narrators are often far from home, either pressing forward into indeterminate futures, or seeking their way back to the known, occasionally returning to places or circumstances that have become unrecognisable or estranging. The collection shifts between Australia, Canada and the United States, reaching back into other remembered homelands. Stories unfold above submerged townships, in backwoods cabins, remote stretches of highway, anonymous hotels or the borrowed rooms of absent strangers. It\u2019s a book about distances, homesickness, and internal and external borders. What were you reading while you wrote it? The collection was written over seven years and several countries so I was impacted by countless books in that time, but if forced to choose one (agony!) it\u2019s Lucia Berlin\u2019s A Manual for Cleaning Women. Berlin\u2019s is a great, wry humanity and a razor-sharp wit honed by lived insight into many contradictory facets of life. What will you read next? On Drugs, philosopher Chris Fleming\u2019s memoir on addiction. I\u2019ve heard several nuanced raves about it from people whose minds I admire, including those who\u2019ve lived with compulsion in one form or another. I read an excerpt online the other day and it articulated something vital about our attitudes towards functional sadness. John Kinsella Hollow Earth Transit Lounge Tell us about your book. Manfred\u2019s childhood alienation leads him to tunnel away from reality, and yet digging in sand can lead to tunnel collapse. Fascinated by caves and underground, he grows up in a world affected by mining \u2013 far away, but close, too. As an adult he goes through the Earth\u2019s crust into Hollow Earth, where he finds a genderless society based on equality and fairness that values environment more than consumer technologies. Finding Ari and Zest, he guides them to the Surface, where they are confronted by horrific rapacity yet also grow quickly addicted to its ways. Searching for an entry back into Hollow Earth, they wander. In a future storyline, the Underworlders \u2013 miners who have discovered Hollow Earth \u2013 break through and plunder and destroy, extracting all they can to feed the surface world. What were you reading while you wrote it? Jules Verne\u2019s Journey to the Centre of the Earth (also with the first film version of this), and other \u201chollow earth\u201d works, especially William R Bradshaw\u2019s colonialist Goddess of Atvatabar. Hollow Earth is a rejection of these works\u2019 values, but also a departure from, and at times dialogue with, their phantasms. What will you read next? I\u2019ve actually already given it a read through but am about to read again Charmaine Papertalk Green\u2019s intense and astonishing Nganajungu Yagu. To quote the poet from the preface, the book \u201cwas inspired by mother\u2019s letters, her life and the love she instilled in me for my people and my culture\u201d. Lucy Treloar Wolfe Island Picador Tell us about your book. Kitty Hawke is the last inhabitant of an island that\u2019s eroding into the windswept Chesapeake Bay. Kept company by her wolfdog and her ghostly memories of the island\u2019s past, she spends her days creating sculptures from the wreckage she finds, until one stormy night her granddaughter and some friends blow ashore, desperate and seeking sanctuary from a world turning bad. Despite her fiercely protected solitude, Kitty can\u2019t turn them away. Soon trouble follows them and like others they flee north towards sanctuary. Part myth, part western, Wolfe Island is set in the nearest of futures in a world that is rapidly changing. What would we each do if we lost the security we take for granted? Would we cling to our drives for love, freedom and belonging? Like countless others, Kitty must discover what she will do to save the people she loves, and where they can find a new home. What were you reading while you wrote it? Denis Johnson\u2019s Train Dreams is a kind of miracle, which I returned to often while writing. Its almost flat tone, despite the events it recounts, creates a mood of unsettling surreality. Johnson is a wonderful observer of people\u2019s adaptability, including to the feverish pace of the \u201cconquest\u201d of the west, the bookend of which \u2013 its ruin \u2013 appears in Wolfe Island. What will you read next? I\u2019ve just started Molly Murn\u2019s Heart of the Grass Tree \u2013 an evocative novel set on Kangaroo Island \u2013 and I feel in wonderfully sure hands. It\u2019s a story of family, first contact between the Ngarrindjeri people and European sealers, and the way history reverberates in the present \u2013 rich material about a region I love. White Tears/Brown Scars Ruby Hamad MUP Tell us about your book. White Tears/Brown Scars is primarily two things. First, it\u2019s a deep dive into the construction of race and gender in settler-colonial societies. Old archetypes of racialised women as \u201cbad Arabs\u201d and \u201cblack Jezebels\u201d and \u201cChina dolls\u201d were created in order to create a binary between women of colour and the \u201cwhite damsel\u201d and these representations shape our contemporary world in a far greater way than is realised. Women are all too often treated as a footnote in history whereas their role and status were pivotal to the development of western society. Second, it is a long overdue validation of the experiences of women of colour whose gendered racialisation results not only in marginalisation and discrimination but in further blame whenever they try to shed light on their mistreatment. Women of colour are repeatedly traumatised in ways society just does not even acknowledge and the impacts on our health and happiness is astronomical. What were you reading while you wrote it? I was already familiar with much of the research I cite in my book but I discovered The Biopolitics of Feeling by Kyla Schuller while writing and it was like the proverbial missing link. I\u2019d been attempting to articulate exactly how and why the white damsel archetype reinforces the system of white supremacy and Schuller\u2019s analysis of 19th century race science reveals that womanhood and femininity were racialised concepts used to fuel colonialism\u2019s domination. What will you read next? Between the book and PhD, my reading has been mostly confined to research so with a little spare time up my sleeve at long last I\u2019m excited to be reading fiction again! Top of my list is The Pillars by Peter Polites. Polites has such an intimate understanding of how race and sex are played off against each other in our society; of how sexuality (much like gender) is a form and function of power. Jane Gilmore Fixed It Viking Tell us about your book. Fixed It is the book I wrote to explain why the media is so often unable to report on women\u2019s lives as valuable, or violent men\u2019s choices as their own responsibility. After four years of taking a red pen to terrible headlines and rewriting them for a social media audience I thought the project needed more thought than just showing what was happening. I needed to understand and explain the who, why and how as well. Although the focus of the Fixed It project is media reporting of men\u2019s violence against women, the book takes a wider, more complex view. It explores how the myths about violence that blame victims and excuse perpetrators permeate all the structures of our lives, from politics to sport, business, pop culture, education and academia. Journalism is often the conduit of information between those structures and the public, so when it ignores the perspective of half the population it\u2019s only fulfilling half its function. Fixed It examines how this happens and what we can do to change it. What were you reading while you wrote it? When Men Murder Women by R Emerson Dobash and Russell P Dobash. They reviewed 866 homicide case files and 200 in-depth interviews with murderers in prison. It\u2019s one of the most detailed studies I could find of men who kill women, why they did it, how they view it and how their childhood connected to the crimes they committed as adults. We can\u2019t change a problem we don\u2019t understand and this book goes a long way to providing some insight into what happens to men to bring them to the point that they believe they are entitled to take a life. What will you read next? The Revolution of Man by Phil Barker. I\u2019ve skimmed it but I want to read it properly because the myths of what manhood should be do so much harm and I think Phil explores this and explains it in ways that give hope to men struggling to be what they want to be rather than what they were told they had to be. Gabrielle Jackson Pain and Prejudice Allen &amp; Unwin Tell us about your book. My book is primarily about women\u2019s pain and how society at once tells us it is part of women\u2019s lot to be in pain, but also dismisses women when they say they are in pain. Studies show that women experience more intense pain and for longer periods than men but are less likely to have their pain treated than men. We know that 70% of chronic pain patients are women but 80% of pain medication has been tested on men or male mice. We also know that pain is processed differently in men and women, so that if drugs are only being tested on men, they may not work on women. My book takes a big-picture look at women and pain and the real-life consequences of ignoring it. What were you reading while you wrote it? Come As You Are by Emily Nagoksi, Doing Harm by Maya Dusenbery, Inferior by Angela Saini and Down Girl by Kate Manne. Each of these books took my book in new directions and helped me plumb new depths, firmly situating women\u2019s pain in patriarchal structures and helping me to explain why we ignore the pain of women, people of colour and gender-diverse people. What will you read next? On my bedside table ready to start this weekend I have Dr Nikki Stamp\u2019s book Pretty Unhealthy: Why our obsession with looking healthy is making us sick. I interviewed Stamp for Pain and Prejudice. She is a cardiothoracic surgeon and an excellent feminist and I cannot wait to get stuck into this book. Jack Charles Born-Again Blakfella Viking Tell us about your book. My book is a memoir of portions of my life, perhaps elements that were seen in Bastardy or Jack Charles vs The Crown. But so much more information has come to light since then thanks to the Koorie Heritage Trust and Link-Up, information about kinship, community and my family ties. As a stolen person, I now know who I am, where I\u2019m going, and what I need to be doing, and I feel the need to share the journey. I called the book Jack Charles: Born-Again Blakfella because I am as passionate as a born-again Christian about the rediscovery of my heritage. What were you reading while you wrote it? To get away from my book completely, I would read Le Carr\u00e9. Smiley\u2019s People I read for the third time. Anything George Smiley. I also watched interviews with Le Carr\u00e9; I watch the TV productions. I like old spy books because they take me into another world. What will you read next? One of the authors I met at Byron Bay writers festival was Melissa Lucashenko, and she gave me her book. It\u2019s a very cheeky title \u2013 Too Much Lip. I intend to indulge myself with her book next.",

The average success rate of all refugee review cases over that time is 7.28%.</p> <p>It was unclear whether Street\u2019s cases were randomly assigned, but his handling of them could be creating more work, not less.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough he is getting through a huge number of cases, where applicants have legal representatives or are savvy enough to appeal their own decisions there\u2019s a significant turnover rate where Street\u2019s decisions are overturned and sent back to be reheard,\u201d Battison said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The chief judge has noted 'many' overturned judgments and has provided Street with 'mentoring and support'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSo I do think it\u2019s a false economy and not in the interest of justice.\u201d</p> <p>The chief judge, William Alstergren, has noted the \u201cmany\u201d overturned judgments and has provided Street with \u201cmentoring and support to assist him and support him to fulfil his duties\u201d.</p> <p>Within the cases there are numerous elements which warrant explanation.</p> <p>In one case, just months after his appointment, lawyers for the minister agreed with an applicant\u2019s request for a judicial review. Street refused to accept the request, prompting the government\u2019s lawyer effectively to have to argue positively for the applicant. The application was still dismissed.</p> <p>In another more recent case the full bench of the federal court criticised Street for not only taking nearly two months to deliver his reasons but for apparently making no effort to do so until it was requested.

      "bodyText": "When Martin* appeared before federal circuit court judge Alexander \u201cSandy\u201d Street earlier this year, Street\u2013 as he has done many times \u2013 delivered his judgment in the case ex tempore (out of time): immediately after the hearing without retiring to deliberate. Martin had come from Kenya on a student visa, applied for protection but was denied, and then spent 11 months in a detention centre before his appeal against the refusal of protection ended up in the federal circuit court. \u201c[Street] didn\u2019t take more than 40 minutes to make the decision that my case should be dismissed,\u201d Martin said. Street failed to follow up with written reasons \u2013 something else he has done on multiple occasions \u2013 and as a result put Martin at risk of imminent deportation without a chance to appeal his case. The decision in Martin\u2019s case is one of a \u201cpattern of decisions\u201d in Street\u2019s court that is causing growing concerns. More than 90 of Street\u2019s rulings have been overturned on appeal and in at least 10 cases Street was found to have denied procedural fairness. The day after Martin\u2019s window to appeal had closed, Border Force showed up at his detention centre room apparently preparing to deport him. \u201c[The officer] told me that \u2018We checked your records and there is nothing ongoing with your case,\u2019 \u201d Martin said. \u201cI told him it\u2019s not my fault because I was not the one making a decision. If judge Street gave the written decision on time I would have made a written appeal for my case.\u201d Martin said he had written to the federal court asking for the reasons but it was waiting on Street. He also called a lawyer, Alison Battison, but she could not lodge applications without the reasons. \u201cI said to Martin, \u2018I can\u2019t do that but maybe you\u2019ll get reasons before the appeal period runs out,\u2019 \u201d Battison told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf not then I\u2019ll explain to Border Force what\u2019s happened.\u201d Border Force knocked on his door anyway. Martin was granted an extension under the circumstances and lodged his own appeal. Once Street published his reasons, Battison was able to seek leave to amend the application to actually address them. \u201cIt\u2019s more paperwork and it can be opposed by the other side,\u201d she said. \u2018A disheartening degree of professional discourtesy\u2019 The law is family business for the Streets. Sandy is the fourth generation to sit on an Australian court bench. Two of his siblings are also judicial officers, and two of his children are in the legal profession. Street\u2019s father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all chief justices of the NSW supreme court. His grandmother, Jessie Street, was a suffragette and human rights campaigner. \u201cI\u2019m extremely aware of the heritage every time I put on my wig and gown and every time I walk into court,\u201d Street told the ABC documentary Dynasties in 2004. He was appointed senior counsel in New South Wales in 1996, and with three decades of experience was appointed to the federal circuit court by the then attorney general, George Brandis, in January 2015. A number of people in the legal sector have described Street\u2019s role as one of efficiency, sitting on a city\u2019s circuit court for a week or so to clear banked-up cases which otherwise might have waited a year or more to be heard. A federal circuit court spokesman said Street was an \u201cextraordinarily hardworking judge and has made a significant contribution to the work of the court, particularly in Sydney and Perth\u201d. Since his appointment he has heard and decided nearly 2,000 cases, including 842 refugee review cases. However, his work stands out not just because of his output, but because of stark differences in timings and outcomes. Martin\u2019s case is not an outlier. While Street\u2019s colleagues on the federal circuit court take an average of 60 days to hand down a judgment on refugee review cases, Street takes less than a day. And data analysis by Macquarie University\u2019s social justice clinic found Street gave a judgment on the same day he heard the case in 816 of the 842 refugee cases. The data could not definitively confirm those judgments were ex tempore, but logic suggests there is little time to write the reasons up on the same day the case is heard. The Macquarie University findings \u2013 which form part of a larger data set on the courts to be released next year \u2013 also revealed that of the 842 refugee appeals, Street found in favour of the applicant in 1.66% of cases. The average success rate of all refugee review cases over that time is 7.28%. It was unclear whether Street\u2019s cases were randomly assigned, but his handling of them could be creating more work, not less. \u201cAlthough he is getting through a huge number of cases, where applicants have legal representatives or are savvy enough to appeal their own decisions there\u2019s a significant turnover rate where Street\u2019s decisions are overturned and sent back to be reheard,\u201d Battison said. \u201cSo I do think it\u2019s a false economy and not in the interest of justice.\u201d The chief judge, William Alstergren, has noted the \u201cmany\u201d overturned judgments and has provided Street with \u201cmentoring and support to assist him and support him to fulfil his duties\u201d. Within the cases there are numerous elements which warrant explanation. In one case, just months after his appointment, lawyers for the minister agreed with an applicant\u2019s request for a judicial review. Street refused to accept the request, prompting the government\u2019s lawyer effectively to have to argue positively for the applicant. The application was still dismissed. In another more recent case the full bench of the federal court criticised Street for not only taking nearly two months to deliver his reasons but for apparently making no effort to do so until it was requested. He also inexplicably ordered the interpreter not to translate his ex tempore judgment for the applicant. In 2018 the full bench found Street failed to recognise \u201cthere was no logical, rational or probative basis\u201d in a decision by the administrative appeals tribunal to refuse asylum to an Indian man because its delegate did not believe he was gay. In a case which dismissed an application to have one of Street\u2019s decision reviewed, the federal court nevertheless found Street\u2019s failure to publish a judgment or respond to the man\u2019s lawyer\u2019s emails and phone calls \u201cshould never have happened\u201d and showed \u201ca disheartening degree of professional discourtesy\u201d. An avenue for independent review is needed In response to community feedback, the Law Council of Australia has begun reviewing appeal judgments from Street \u201cand has been concerned about the pattern of decisions that relate to the absence of procedural fairness\u201d, its president, Arthur Moses SC, told Guardian Australia. The council has previously expressed concern that the conduct \u201cof some judicial officers\u201d was detracting from the hard work by most of the judges, conducted \u201cdespite a crushing workload in an under-resourced court\u201d. Moses said he had been concerned \u201cfor some time\u201d at the lack of a full-time chief judge for the federal circuit court. Alstergren oversees both the federal circuit and family courts. At the same time, the workload of circuit court judges has increased to an unsustainable level, Moses said. This was detrimental to judges\u2019 health and the quality of justice. Last year the circuit court introduced what it called \u201csubstantial measures to assist and support judicial officers\u201d. This included a more rigorous induction process, formal ongoing mentoring, closer management and monitoring of judgments, and a counselling process with judges from superior courts. Lawyers have told Guardian Australia that long wait times for court hearings are having a negative impact on their asylum seeker clients, many of whom are detained in the interim. While having their case moved up was in many ways a blessing, appearing before Street suggested their chances of success were significantly lower. Battison says she had not encountered late delivery of reasons from any other judge. Although the federal court said it had a \u201ccomprehensive complaints procedure\u201d, its website notes that it also \u201cdoes not, and cannot, provide a mechanism for disciplining a judge\u201d. Complaints about judicial officers are dealt with by the chief judge, but the subject of a complaint, associated documents, any referral to the attorney general, and subsequent action on the complaint is confidential. In consultation with the chief judge the attorney general may bring a complaint to the attention of parliament, which may decide to hold a commission of inquiry. The process is exempt from freedom of information laws. \u201cThe law council has long supported the creation of a federal judicial commission to support judicial education and provide a fair, transparent and independent manner for any complaints against judicial officers to be heard and determined,\u201d Moses said. Calls for independent review bodies have echoed around the country, including among other chief judges. Dr Gabrielle Appleby, a professor at the University of New South Wales law faculty, said reforms in 2012 simply provided a statutory framework for a traditional system of accountability that was not functioning properly, and did not provide for an independent body. Appleby said there were \u201cmajor issues\u201d with transparency, with the chief judge\u2019s ability to investigate complaints and to take action. \u201cThey have very limited powers available to them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chief judge can only take action that the judicial officer involved agrees to be a part of.\u201d A lack of transparency was detrimental to complainants, the general public and the judges themselves who can struggle to clear their name after a complaint. \u201cWe need at the federal level an \u2026 independent body to handle complaints against judges, a transparent process, clear powers to investigate those complaints, and a clear set of consequences for judges,\u201d Appleby said. In the meantime Martin has been transferred \u2013 without warning and in pre-dawn hours \u2013 to another detention centre on the other side of the country while he awaits his next hearing. The courts agreed to the extension of time, and he will be represented by Battison. \u201cI am not comfortable sleeping because I feel any time they can come and handcuff me and put me on a plane,\u201d he said. Requests for comment to Street were referred to the federal court.",

      "bodyText": "In 2006, a young Cambodian sculptor, Vannak Anan Prum, left his village to look for labouring work. He needed to earn enough money to pay for his wife Sokun\u2019s impending hospital stay to give birth to their first child. He intended to be away for two months. He would not see his wife again for five years. After a middleman on the Thai-Cambodian border promised he could earn a lot of money drying fish, Prum was sold into slave labour, sent to sea on a fishing trawler. He was forced to work around the clock and through storms, allowed a maximum two hours\u2019 sleep by day and two hours at night. Violence happened on the boat every day for the next four years as a way of keeping those enslaved in line, Prum tells Guardian Australia through a translator. He says people would disappear off the boats without warning, and were assumed to have been killed and thrown into the sea. One night, Prum says he saw one Thai worker cut another man\u2019s head off with a cleaver. Prum writes about and explicitly draws these horrific experiences in his new graphic memoir of modern slavery, The Dead Eye and the Deep Blue Sea. The story includes his experience of jumping ship to attempt to swim to his escape, only to be sold by his \u201crescuers\u201d into slavery on a palm oil plantation on the Malaysian coast. His return home to his wife and the daughter born in his absence was eventually secured by LICADHO, a Cambodian human rights organisation, in 2011. \u201cThere are many slaves who die in the ocean, and their children don\u2019t know where they have gone,\u201d says Prum. \u201cIf we don\u2019t share these stories, the world doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the middle of the ocean.\u201d The rest of the world is implicated in this slavery. Some of the \u201ctrash fish\u201d caught by enforced labour on these boats gets used as pet food sold in supermarkets, as well as used as a cheap protein feed in prawn farming. An estimated 200,000 migrant workers from Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos are prone to such exploitation by the $6.5bn Thai fishing industry, according to the Raks Thai Foundation. But the figures are hard to confirm, says Kate Kennedy, a former executive officer of Hagar Australia, part of an international organisation dedicated to restoring the lives of people broken by human trafficking. The boys and men are typically \u201ctricked\u201d on to boats, says Kennedy, bonded with a debt that never goes away: \u201cThey\u2019re not being paid, they\u2019re trapped on boats, and it\u2019s particularly violent.\u201d Ship captains use electric shock treatment, sleep deprivation and drugs to keep the labourers passive, she says. In 2015, Hagar helped rehabilitate some of the hundreds of boys and young men rescued in the Indonesian town of Benjina, which straddles two islands in the Indonesian province of Maluku, about 800km north of Darwin. The workers had been enslaved on Thai shipping trawlers for years, many incarcerated on the island in iron cages. Most of those workers had seen a \u201cdemonstration murder\u201d, says Kennedy, and post-traumatic stress is a \u201cmassive characteristic\u201d of these victims. Non-government organisations such as Hagar attempt to give these boys and men vocational training to repurpose their lives. \u201cA number ended up just going back into the fishing industry,\u201d says Kennedy. \u201cIt was the only way they knew how to live, which was all so awful.\u201d Kennedy is an executive producer of a new live-action feature film, Buoyancy, by Melbourne director and writer Rodd Rathjen. It is a story of the Thai fishing slave trade, and the characters\u2019 experiences are based on Rathjen\u2019s interviews with slavery survivors such as those on Benjina. The movie, though fictional and unrelated to Prum\u2019s slavery graphic memoir, is strikingly similar in its subject matter. Buoyancy is naturalistic in style and uses untrained actors, including, in non-speaking roles, some who had been enslaved on trawlers \u201cto varying degrees\u201d, says Rathjen. In his acting debut, Cambodian Sarm Heng plays Chakra, who is tricked on to a Thai fishing trawler where he witnesses violence, torture and murder. Heng, a former street kid found by the casting director through Green Gecko, a non-government organisation in San Riep, was 14 at the time of filming, which took place over three weeks off the coast at Sihanoukville. \u201cSome of the things I asked Sarm to experience emotionally and psychologically were quite challenging for him,\u201d says Rathjen. \u201cWe just had to separate the acting from real life and throw our arms around him when we were finished shooting.\u201d Rathjen says that speaking to survivors, he came to understand the \u201cprocess of dehumanisation\u201d that takes place on the boats, and he wants his Buoyancy audience to wonder whether the character of Chakra, also aged 14, will become violent like his captain, Rom Ran (played by Thanawut Kasro). \u201cI wanted to understand how you become capable of such brutality and inhumanity,\u201d he says.

      "body": "<h2>Lisa Nandy, Wigan MP <br></h2> <p><em>Leave with the best deal possible, but stay close to EU</em></p> <p>\u201cLabour\u2019s divisions reflect those in the country, representing areas where a second referendum and Remain seem inevitable and places where it seems absurd. Acknowledging this shows a refreshing willingness to be honest with the public and a desire to heal the divisions that exist. But serious problems remain. A second referendum, before any serious attempt to implement the first, holds no legitimacy for millions who voted in good faith and believe democracy is at stake. The prime minister trashes democratic norms. We cannot afford to do the same.

If we never, as seems only right, discover the outcome for Anoush, this episode already, as with many historical experiments, says much about child rearing as a snapshot of contemporary adult obsessions. \u201cIn the end,\u201d says Anoush\u2019s father, \u201cit has proven to be a really beautiful thing and we\u2019ve had a lot of important conversations from it.\u201d Where his experiment differs, perhaps, from its predecessors is the parental assumption that other uninvolved \u2013 or even actively opposed \u2013 adults should endorse the sex-hiding, with its curious echoes of the fall. Even the most extreme Rousseau practitioner was likely to resist a request to have a natural child of little Dick\u2019s calibre over for a visit. Non-adherents would have felt zero compunction. But Anoush\u2019s parents, possibly influenced by the proliferation of pronoun requests from adults, now including Sam Smith, ask family and friends, by using \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d, effectively to support their contention that a baby\u2019s physical sex, rather than societal responses to it, is the problem and its concealment a promising remedy. \u201cGod makes all things good,\u201d Rousseau begins \u00c9mile. \u201cMan meddles with them and they become evil.\u201d They had a point. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

Labour now says it will fight an election committed to a second referendum, with Remain as one option and a \u201ccredible Leave option\u201d as the other. That is a long way from its 2017 manifesto position, which committed Labour to honouring the result of the first referendum. But this shift may not be enough for tribal Remain voters, who now see the Lib Dems as a more credible champion of their cause, particularly as Labour refuses to commit in advance to campaigning for Remain in a second referendum. The risk for Labour is that seeking the middle of the road on Brexit gets them run over by an electorate no longer interested in compromise \u2013 69% of voters rate Labour\u2019s current Brexit policy as \u201cunclear\u201d and 63% disapprove of Corbyn\u2019s handling of the issue.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The risk is that seeking the middle of the road on Brexit gets Labour run over by an electorate no longer interested in compromise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How worried should Labour be? The electoral risks are mounting. Labour has lost half of its 2017 support, and some polls now put them behind the Lib Dems overall. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal ratings have slumped since the 2017 election and are now the worst ever recorded for an opposition leader. Labour optimists will point to the party\u2019s dramatic turnaround in the previous general election campaign as evidence that there is no need to panic. Once an election is upon us, Remain voters will again recognise that Labour is the only viable alternative to a hard Brexit Conservative government, and will return to the fold. The Lib Dems\u2019 rise may even play out in Labour\u2019s favour, if the Lib Dems challenge the Conservatives in southern English seats where Labour is out of contention, while being tactically squeezed in Conservative-Labour marginals where Labour is best placed to defeat the Conservatives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/labour-brexit-policy-five-key-party-voices\">What should Labour do about Brexit? Five key party voices</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet the differences between 2017 and 2019 are hard to ignore. The Lib Dems are far stronger now, driven by a positive public response to their strident Remain position. They have secured defections from both parties, have an uncompromising pro-EU stance, and a fresh face to present to the electorate. Memories of the coalition have faded, and a repeat of Tim Farron\u2019s misfiring 2017 election campaign is unlikely.</p> <p>Labour should worry that a 2019 campaign will be less like 2017 and more like 2010, when the contrast between a fresh young Nick Clegg and two unpopular main party leaders fuelled a campaign surge for the Lib Dems. If such a surge were to happen, it could feed on itself, as polls showing the Lib Dems ahead of Labour encourage further defections from Remain voters who no longer feel they have to accept second best from Labour. The logic of the two-party squeeze could be thrown into reverse. Such dramatic shifts look implausible, but these are volatile times. Labour delegates have plenty to ponder.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Robert Ford is </em><em>professor of Political Science at the University of Manchester and co-editor of </em><em>Sex, Lies</em><em> and Politics</em></p>",

But this shift may not be enough for tribal Remain voters, who now see the Lib Dems as a more credible champion of their cause, particularly as Labour refuses to commit in advance to campaigning for Remain in a second referendum. The risk for Labour is that seeking the middle of the road on Brexit gets them run over by an electorate no longer interested in compromise \u2013 69% of voters rate Labour\u2019s current Brexit policy as \u201cunclear\u201d and 63% disapprove of Corbyn\u2019s handling of the issue. How worried should Labour be? The electoral risks are mounting. Labour has lost half of its 2017 support, and some polls now put them behind the Lib Dems overall. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal ratings have slumped since the 2017 election and are now the worst ever recorded for an opposition leader. Labour optimists will point to the party\u2019s dramatic turnaround in the previous general election campaign as evidence that there is no need to panic. Once an election is upon us, Remain voters will again recognise that Labour is the only viable alternative to a hard Brexit Conservative government, and will return to the fold. The Lib Dems\u2019 rise may even play out in Labour\u2019s favour, if the Lib Dems challenge the Conservatives in southern English seats where Labour is out of contention, while being tactically squeezed in Conservative-Labour marginals where Labour is best placed to defeat the Conservatives. Yet the differences between 2017 and 2019 are hard to ignore. The Lib Dems are far stronger now, driven by a positive public response to their strident Remain position. They have secured defections from both parties, have an uncompromising pro-EU stance, and a fresh face to present to the electorate. Memories of the coalition have faded, and a repeat of Tim Farron\u2019s misfiring 2017 election campaign is unlikely. Labour should worry that a 2019 campaign will be less like 2017 and more like 2010, when the contrast between a fresh young Nick Clegg and two unpopular main party leaders fuelled a campaign surge for the Lib Dems. If such a surge were to happen, it could feed on itself, as polls showing the Lib Dems ahead of Labour encourage further defections from Remain voters who no longer feel they have to accept second best from Labour. The logic of the two-party squeeze could be thrown into reverse. Such dramatic shifts look implausible, but these are volatile times. Labour delegates have plenty to ponder. \u2022 Robert Ford is professor of Political Science at the University of Manchester and co-editor of Sex, Lies and Politics",

Surveying the blank expanse of the Tate St Ives extension under its softly diffused light, she explains that <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-st-ives/exhibition/otobong-nkanga\" title=\"\">more than 100 of her works will be shown</a> without any partition walls, withdrawing the visual cues that would traditionally make order of an exhibition as big as hers.</p> <p>For a show exploring the politics of empire, of land acquisition and environmental damage, of borders and ownership, it seems a deliberate and poignant choice. Nkanga, who was born in Nigeria and lives in Belgium, has been creating exciting, multi- disciplinary work for almost 20 years.</p> <p>She has been described as \u201ca future great \u2026 with keen visual intelligence\u201d by <em>Art Review</em> and a powerhouse by the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. From Where I Stand \u2013 her first museum show in the UK \u2013 is also the first this grand in scope for a black female artist in the Tate galleries. Is she nervous?</p> <p>\u201cA museum show is a place to really try out work. People enter into a focused space,\u201d she says, relaxed but excited. To that end, she is producing a new wall painting, freehand, and has included her most provocative pieces: a tapestry entitled <em>The Weight of Scars</em>, and multimedia installations, <em>The Pursuit of Bling</em> and <em>Tsumeb Fragments</em>. The mining of the world\u2019s natural resources, the colonisation of Namibia and the exploitation of black bodies are themes Nkanga builds on.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things I worry about is that some people will just look [at my work] and think, \u2018Oh, floods? Corruption? Parliament is burning down? That happens to <em>those</em> people,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if you\u2019re working from a place trying to connect history, it\u2019s like [some audiences] have a part of the brain that is shut down to never understand that they are also involved and connected.</p> <p>\u201cSo they think: \u2018Yes, people in the Bahamas are the ones who suffer hurricanes. People in Nigeria or India or whatever, they have problems.\u2019 That is considered \u2018normal\u2019. But the funny thing is that it\u2019s coming closer.

The family home burned down when she was a child, and she had lost both parents by the time she was 17. With her older sister, she looked after their younger brother, but still fulfilled her childhood ambition of attending art school, studying at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam, and going on to exhibit across the world. She has won multiple awards and prizes, including the Sharjah Art Foundation prize over the summer, and will be the inaugural recipient of a major new award, to be announced next week.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think about generational traumas,\u201d she says of her work centred around the colonisation of Africa. \u201cI know they are there, but I was brought up to keep moving forward. Life is not there to be pleasant \u2013 you make it pleasant because everything around you is not in favour of you and you\u2019re very conscious of that.

      "bodyText": "Otobong Nkanga is doing away with boundaries. Surveying the blank expanse of the Tate St Ives extension under its softly diffused light, she explains that more than 100 of her works will be shown without any partition walls, withdrawing the visual cues that would traditionally make order of an exhibition as big as hers. For a show exploring the politics of empire, of land acquisition and environmental damage, of borders and ownership, it seems a deliberate and poignant choice. Nkanga, who was born in Nigeria and lives in Belgium, has been creating exciting, multi- disciplinary work for almost 20 years. She has been described as \u201ca future great \u2026 with keen visual intelligence\u201d by Art Review and a powerhouse by the Chicago Tribune. From Where I Stand \u2013 her first museum show in the UK \u2013 is also the first this grand in scope for a black female artist in the Tate galleries. Is she nervous? \u201cA museum show is a place to really try out work. People enter into a focused space,\u201d she says, relaxed but excited. To that end, she is producing a new wall painting, freehand, and has included her most provocative pieces: a tapestry entitled The Weight of Scars, and multimedia installations, The Pursuit of Bling and Tsumeb Fragments. The mining of the world\u2019s natural resources, the colonisation of Namibia and the exploitation of black bodies are themes Nkanga builds on. \u201cOne of the things I worry about is that some people will just look [at my work] and think, \u2018Oh, floods? Corruption? Parliament is burning down? That happens to those people,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if you\u2019re working from a place trying to connect history, it\u2019s like [some audiences] have a part of the brain that is shut down to never understand that they are also involved and connected. \u201cSo they think: \u2018Yes, people in the Bahamas are the ones who suffer hurricanes. People in Nigeria or India or whatever, they have problems.\u2019 That is considered \u2018normal\u2019. But the funny thing is that it\u2019s coming closer. Some of it just hasn\u2019t yet touched here.\u201d Nkanga\u2019s mother was a teacher in Lagos and her father worked in communications. The family home burned down when she was a child, and she had lost both parents by the time she was 17. With her older sister, she looked after their younger brother, but still fulfilled her childhood ambition of attending art school, studying at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam, and going on to exhibit across the world. She has won multiple awards and prizes, including the Sharjah Art Foundation prize over the summer, and will be the inaugural recipient of a major new award, to be announced next week. \u201cI don\u2019t think about generational traumas,\u201d she says of her work centred around the colonisation of Africa. \u201cI know they are there, but I was brought up to keep moving forward. Life is not there to be pleasant \u2013 you make it pleasant because everything around you is not in favour of you and you\u2019re very conscious of that. You can\u2019t be defeated by life, you have to grab it.\u201d Nkanga has been through the process of applying for Belgian nationality. She has lived in Europe for more than 20 years and has a Dutch husband, but says Trump, Brexit and \u201cthe heat of white extremists burning up\u201d has worried her. \u201cEven for this show, we started work 18 months ago but I couldn\u2019t come over. The application is hell, it\u2019s over 20 pages.\u201d She snorts at the notion that a gallery might deal with a visa application. \u201cYou have to do it yourself. Does the gallery know the names of my grandparents? Where I have been in the last 10 years? Do they know how much I have in my bank account and whether I can afford to come over?\u201d The UK operates a dehumanising process, she says, and one that artists like her expect to get worse. \u201cAlarm bells went off in 2016 \u2026 One finds it very difficult from the perspective of the west to put themselves in the shoes of people [like me],\u201d she says. \u201cIt always seems like something foreign to them.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 26 September 2019 to clarify that the artist\u2019s Belgian nationality application process is in the past, not still ongoing.",

      "bodyText": "Brighton played 692 passes to Newcastle\u2019s 277. But they also did no goals to Newcastle\u2019s none. Still want more? Bet you do. Peep peep! Both sides will be a bit frustrated with that \u2013 Newcastle because of their performance, Brighton because of the result. They were in complete control for 75 minutes, albeit without creating many clear chances, and will feel they should have won. There\u2019s lots to admire in the way they play, but they need more of a cutting edge. 90+5 min Saint-Maximin\u2019s booming cross towards Carroll is brilliantly headed away by Dunk, who is accidentally flattened by Carroll as he falls. 90+4 min Newcastle, who have struggled for most of the evening, now don\u2019t want this game to end. 90+2 min Ryan charges from his area to intercept a long pass towards Saint-Maximin. 90+1 min There will be six minutes of added time. 90 min Joelinton wafts into orbit from 25 yards. It\u2019s been a strong finish from Newcastle, though, who have looked the likelier scores in the last 15 minutes. 88 min Dunk is booked for flattening Saint-Maximin. If he stays fit, Newcastle will be fine this season. 87 min Carroll is fouled by Propper, 35 yards from goal. Ki\u2019s free-kick into a dangerous area is chested behind by Stephens. 86 min Bissouma\u2019s sharp low shot from 25 yards is pushed away by the sprawling Dubravka. 83 min Saint-Maximin plays a one-two with Carroll and hits a long-range curler that is comfortably saved by Ryan. Newcastle have been so much better since Saint-Maximin came on. A word on Brighton\u2019s Irish teenager Aaron Connolly, too, who has looked a class act since he came on as substitute. 82 min Andy Carroll is back: he comes on to replace Jetro Willems, and the place explodes. 81 min Brighton make a double change, with Neal Maupay and Pascal Gross replaced by Yves Bissouma and Gaetan Bong. 80 min There\u2019s a huge roar around the ground, which can mean only one thing: the big man is stripping off. 79 min Atsu is booked for a lunge at Connolly. 78 min This is a much more even game now. Saint-Maximin has been excellent since coming on, and his low cross towards Atsu is bravely claimed by Ryan. 76 min Alzate goes over after a challenge from Dubravka. Martin Atkinson says no penalty, and replays show it was a clear dive. 74 min: Schar clears off the line! That was a spectacular piece of defending, an acrobatic clearance after the substitute Connolly flicked a beautifully arrogant half-volley over the outrushing Dubravka. Newcastle raced down the other end, where Joelinton\u2019s shot was brilliantly blocked by the sliding Dunk. 73 min A double change for Newcastle: Sung-Yueng Ki and Allan Saint-Maximin replace Miguel Almiron and Jonjo Shelvey. 70 min Brighton make a change, with the young forward Aaron Connolly replacing Aaron Mooy. 69 min Propper\u2019s insouciant stab with the outside of the foot finds Maupay, whose chest/volley from 15 yards goes over the bar. 67 min Stephens blooters into orbit from 30 yards. For the first time, Brighton are starting to look impatient. 64 min Atsu played a through pass towards Joelinton, but Dunk comes round to make a good tackle. Moments later, Shelvey hits a wobbling shot from long-range that is comfortably saved by Ryan. 60 min Maupay\u2019s snapshot from 17 yards whistles high and wide. 59 min Almiron slips Burn beautifully on the halfway line and charges towards the edge of the area. He opens his body to pass the ball into the far corner with his left foot, but it\u2019s a tame effort and Ryan makes an easy save. 57 min Stephens belts one from 25 yards that is blocked by Lascelles, I think. For all Brighton\u2019s possession, and it has been very impressive, most of their attempts at goal have been from outside the area. 54 min Maupay wriggles away from Schar just outside the area and hits a stinging shot that is crucially blocked by Lascelles. Ten seconds later, Gross whistles a rising drive just over the bar from 25 yards. Dubravka had it covered, in fairness. 52 min Newcastle look low on confidence when they have the ball. If it stays like this, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see Andy Carroll and Allan Saint-Maximin. 50 min After that early Atsu chance, Brighton have picked up where they left off at half-time by dominating possession. 46 min A good chance for Atsu after 43 seconds of the second half. Burn lost the ball to Almiron on the left edge of the Brighton area. The ball was moved infield to Joelinton, who picked out the onrushing Atsu with a precise pass. He had to take the shot first time and sidefooted it well wide. 46 min Peep peep! Newcastle begin the second half. Peep peep! Newcastle are booed off, having been outplayed throughout the first half. Brighton\u2019s passing and movement were excellent - yet it was Newcastle who had the two best chances of the game. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45 min The one thing that will please Steve Bruce is that, for all Brighton\u2019s dominance, Dubravka has had only one save to make. 43 min Newcastle have had more of the game in the last few minutes. Saying which, Manquillo is booked for a foul on Alzate. He then blocked Brighton taking a quick free-kick, which is also a bookable offence in some cultures, though I\u2019m pretty sure the card was for the original foul. 37 min Brighton have had 75 per cent of the possession so far. 36 min \u201cIn kids football here in Norway, if one team goes into a three-goal lead, the other is allowed an extra player,\u201d says Brendan Large. \u201cMaybe City should play with the same rule... against Watford anyway.\u201d It really is ludicrous. The teams have met eight times since Pep Guardiola came to England; City have won them all, with an aggregate score of 35-3. 34 min: Alzate has a goal disallowed for offside! It was a nice header, steered across Dubravka from Gross\u2019s chipped cross, but replays showed he was fractionally offside. 33 min Newcastle have switched to a back four in an attempt to restore some order, with Dummett going to left back and Willems moving into midfield. 32 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cIs Jason Roy still at the game? Half an hour was about his limit during the Ashes.\u201d Honk! 31 min: Joelinton misses an excellent chance! It was a free header, 10 yards out, from Shelvey\u2019s outswinging corner, but he flicked it just wide of the far post. Newcastle have had two excellent chances. 29 min This is a 0-0 battering. Propper moves into the area on the right and pulls the ball back to the late-arriving Mooy, who screws a first-time shot high and wide. The ball was just slightly behind him. 27 min \u201cEight bleedin\u2019 Nil,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cIt hurts, Rob. It hurts so much.\u201d Watford should refuse to play City from now on. It\u2019s just getting silly. 26 min Maupay has two close-range shots blocked in quick succession. The chance came after another fine move: Montoya played a precise pass into the underlapping Stephens, whose first-time cross found Maupay on the six-yard line. His first shot was blocked by Manquillo (I think), and Lascelles was in the way of the follow-up. Alzate would have had an open goal had Maupay seen him to the left, but he didn\u2019t. 25 min A chance for Brighton. Burn\u2019s flighted cross from the left finds Gross beyond the far post. He loves an assist, that lad, so he tries to head it down towards Maupay when it looked much easier to go for goal. His header hits Lascelles and rebounds to safety. 24 min There was a tackle from Burn on Joelinton a couple of minutes ago which probably should have earned a yellow card. He took the ball but then followed through with his studs. 22 min: Ryan makes an important save from Almiron! That came out of nothing. He was put through by Joelinton and cracked a first-time shot at goal from 15 yards. It was well struck with his left foot but too close to Ryan, who pushed it away. For all Brighton\u2019s fine football, that was the best chance of the match so far. 20 min Propper\u2019s long-range shot is blocked by his team-mate Gross. That came after another fine passing move. 18 min Mooy\u2019s left-wing corner deflects off the back of Lascelles at the near post and drops onto the top of the crossbar! Dubravka was scrambling desperately across his line, though I think he would have got there had it been on target. 18 min Newcastle just can\u2019t get into this game. Brighton have been so impressive, even if their domination is slightly on the sterile side. 16 min Newcastle win their first corner. And nothing happens. 13 min Brighton continue to dominate the match to an almost startling degree. They\u2019ve played with a really impressive authority so far. 12 min Newcastle break promisingly from a Brighton corner, but Almiron overhits an ambitious through pass to Willems. 9 min: Dubravka makes a good save from Maupay! It was a classy, length-of-the-field move from Brighton, which started with the keeper Ryan playing the ball into Stephens on the edge of the area. Two passes later, Maupay was haring through the inside-right channel to hit a rising shot from a tight angle that was well blocked by Dubravka. 8 min Newcastle\u2019s first decent attack. Joelinton picks out a very deep cross to Willems, who waits for the ball to bounce and cuts across a good strike that is blocked by a defender. 7 min Nothing much to report. Brighton have looked good, though, with some smooth, passing passing. 4 min A confident start from Brighton, who have had most of the possession so far. 1 min Peep peep! Brighton, in their green away strip, kick off from left to right. You know what colours Newcastle are wearing. A few of the England cricket team are at the game: Ben Stokes, Mark Wood, Jason Roy and Rory Burns. God bless them. Some match reports from the earlier games If you haven\u2019t seen Harry Kane\u2019s goal, please address the situation at your earliest convenience. A tip for Newcastle fans This interview with John Beresford MBE is absolutely brilliant. Every episode of Undr The Cosh is magnificent, but this is possibly the best of the lot. Taking the positives Watford avoided the biggest-ever Premier League defeat, which looked unlikely when they were 7-0 down after an hour.

If that\u2019s not enough to get your knees trembling with excitement, Andy Carroll should be in a Newcastle squad for the first time since 2011. Kick off is at 5.30pm.",

Now even that pose \u2013 how can a head of state be above politics? \u2013 has been exposed, as Buckingham Palace\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-cameron-palace-anger-mounts-as-former-pm-spills-secrets-about-queen-9ff9rc9s2\" title=\"\">displeasure and annoyance</a>\u201d at David Cameron reveals. It is not angry because he \u201cdragged the Queen into politics\u201d but because he revealed that she happily got stuck in without the need for dragging.</p> <p>She did not slap down Cameron in 2014. She did not cry: \u201cNever in my reign has one of my prime ministers dared to suggest that I intervene in a political debate.\u201d Cameron asked her to tell the Scots that she did not want them to vote for independence. She was to keep it classy \u2013 she was the Queen, after all. He was \u201cnot asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional, just a raising of the eyebrow, even, you know, a quarter of an inch\u201d. She duly urged Scottish voters to \u201cthink very carefully about the future\u201d. The popularity of the Queen rests on the notion that she is not political. Naturally, that made her political intervention all the more effective.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Johnson exploited the convention that the Queen does what the PM tells her, and got his way</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cameron has revealed that the tearing up of the conventions that once governed Britain did not begin with Brexit and no amount of smoke from the \u201cconstitutional experts\u201d the British have in place of a written constitution can hide the fact.

      "bodyText": "The Queen is a sham head of state. She cannot act as a constitutional president and force rival politicians to look for ways out of a national emergency. She cannot insist that the prime minister obeys the rules, because there are too few rules in Britain and too many woozy, unenforceable conventions. Elizabeth II\u2019s strength came from being \u201cabove politics\u201d. Now even that pose \u2013 how can a head of state be above politics? \u2013 has been exposed, as Buckingham Palace\u2019s \u201cdispleasure and annoyance\u201d at David Cameron reveals. It is not angry because he \u201cdragged the Queen into politics\u201d but because he revealed that she happily got stuck in without the need for dragging. She did not slap down Cameron in 2014. She did not cry: \u201cNever in my reign has one of my prime ministers dared to suggest that I intervene in a political debate.\u201d Cameron asked her to tell the Scots that she did not want them to vote for independence. She was to keep it classy \u2013 she was the Queen, after all. He was \u201cnot asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional, just a raising of the eyebrow, even, you know, a quarter of an inch\u201d. She duly urged Scottish voters to \u201cthink very carefully about the future\u201d. The popularity of the Queen rests on the notion that she is not political. Naturally, that made her political intervention all the more effective. Cameron has revealed that the tearing up of the conventions that once governed Britain did not begin with Brexit and no amount of smoke from the \u201cconstitutional experts\u201d the British have in place of a written constitution can hide the fact. Peter Hennessy, who I like enough to suspect knows better, spoke for virtually the entire national media when he blamed Cameron and excused the sovereign. \u201cThese things have to be kept private,\u201d he thundered, while ignoring that there was nothing private about her intervention in the Scottish referendum. No one asked why the monarch cannot intervene in politics, as Prince Charles has done for years. At the level of prime ministers, what would stop a Corbyn administration, say, telling the Queen to use her political clout \u2013 nothing improper or unconstitutional, just a raising of the eyebrow \u2013 to help it? If the Queen were to refuse, as she is likely to, because the head of a hereditary aristocracy is no more likely to support a radical left programme than Scottish independence, could Corbyn denounce her political bias?

He behaved as if he commanded a Commons majority and it had mandated him to shutter parliament for five weeks. Critics condemn Johnson\u2019s lies to the public and, presumably, to the Queen. I accept that the brass-necked absurdity of pretending he is not trying to avoid being held to account on Brexit is his greatest insult to the national intelligence to date. More important constitutionally are his double standards. He is behaving as if he is a strong prime minister when he is an enfeebled politician without a mandate or a majority. When a prime minister with a majority asks the Queen for a prorogation, it\u2019s a simple administrative matter. Parliament approves, so no one can object. Johnson has no majority. He is using prorogation to escape the democratic control of the majority MPs. He and Cummings are the most dangerous type of men I know: wimps who pose as tough guys, and lash out at everyone who exposes them. Anne Twomey, the leading authority on monarchical power in Commonwealth democracies, thinks the Queen had the right to say Johnson\u2019s request to close parliament was \u201cunconstitutional\u201d because it was \u201cdone for the purpose of avoiding a vote of no confidence or other action by parliament against the government\u2019s will\u201d. In other words, he was seeking to silence MPs and deny the fundamental duty of the legislature to scrutinise the executive. Johnson exploited the convention that the Queen does what the PM tells her and got his way. But another convention is that she stays out of politics and she has broken that.

If she agrees to suspend parliament twice it will be political. If she refuses it will be political. There\u2019s no escaping the politics.

Interrupted only by the summer holidays and a temporary high court injunction moving the drama away from the school gates, demonstrators have been preparing to rally again on Friday, two weeks before the case goes back to court. At the centre of all of it is Shakeel Afsar, a 32-year-old property developer. He doesn\u2019t have children at the school, but says he is the spokesperson for parents, including his sister Rosina.</p> <p>In a school where about 90% of the pupils are Muslim, predominantly from families with Mirpur heritage, the teachers have a difficult balancing act: how to respect the values of its parents, who come from what has been known as one of the most rural and conservative cultures in Pakistan, while preparing the children properly for modern life in Britain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdc5b093036607ee011d74ed5ed085026bdbee80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdc5b093036607ee011d74ed5ed085026bdbee80/0_104_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parents protest outside the school.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Parents protest outside the school.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At nearby Parkfield School, where the protests first began in March, a decision was made to suspend its \u201cNo Outsiders\u201d programme, an LGBTQ-inclusive scheme drawn up by assistant head Andrew Moffat, and reinstated over the summer term after months of consultation. But Anderton Park, which has been described as \u201ca leading light in Birmingham for its equalities work\u201d by the local authority, is not prepared to capitulate to what its head Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson calls \u201cdemands led by misinformation, deliberately misleading and intimidating parents, teachers and children.\u201d Afsar says his supporters \u201care the majority of parents at [Anderton Park] who weren\u2019t consulted by Hewitt-Clarkson about her LGBTQ agenda, and are upset that they\u2019re being ignored. Their four-year-old kids are coming home confused asking about two mummies and two daddies, and boys being girls and girls being boys. That\u2019s too young,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p> <p>From the bright pastel warmth of her office, Hewitt-Clarkson clarifies what she has been telling parents since the beginning of the year: The school isn\u2019t teaching the children about sex, gay sex, or gender reassignment. \u201cWhat we do have are books that might show a child with two mums or two dads, black families, Muslim families, white families \u2013 stories that show children the representation of all families,\u201d she says, exasperated. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an \u2018LGBT programme\u2019 \u2026 in 700 hours of staff training in my 13 years here, we\u2019ve done two hours of meetings on LGBT equality, and they say I am obsessed.

Some worry that their children will lose religious values taught at home. Others are growing dubious of Afsar and want the whole issue resolved. \u201cEveryone should respect everyone,\u201d says a mother who gives her name as Nafisa. \u201cBut how can children understand what is halal [permitted] and what is haram [forbidden] as Muslims when they are told this at school and that at home?\u201d</p> <p>Afsar\u2019s critics call him \u201ca failed YouTuber\u201d, and say he is intent on creating a circus around \u201cThe Shakeel Show\u201d \u2013 for notoriety, to launch a political career. His GoFundMe page, which crowd-sourced almost \u00a310,000 within a week to mount a legal case against the school before being closed down, had him bombarded with questions about his motives online, while a picture of him at home during Ramadan, bizarrely posing with Katie Hopkins, a right-wing commentator, soured some of the momentum behind him.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t about the kids any more,\u201d says Saima Razzaq, a local Muslim activist who describes herself as \u201cqueer\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s about Shakeel\u2019s ego. I think he\u2019s a pawn \u2013 there are other figures involved in these protests who are trying to whip up this same hostility up and down the country.\u201d</p> <p>Seated behind his desk amid a clutter of files, boxes and a wall map of Kashmir, Afsar scoffs. \u201cListen, I have no interest in becoming a politician, or standing. This isn\u2019t about my career \u2013 I am a very successful businessman \u2013 I\u2019m just here fighting for parental rights.\u201d</p> <p>An hour later he giggles and asks me: \u201cDo you think I should become an MP? I think I\u2019ll do it, you know. I swear to God, maybe I\u2019ll stand when Roger Godsiff [the constituency MP] resigns.

I\u2019m not an extremist or a mad man, I\u2019m not saying bring Sharia law here, we are a democratic country. In a democracy, LGBT people have the right to do what they want, and I have the right not to agree with it. I don\u2019t discriminate or want any harm to them. Just because I think a gay relationship is not a valid moral relationship does not mean I am homophobic.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his persistently circular logic and frequent contradictions, such is Afsar\u2019s inexplicable charm that even Razzaq and gay Muslim campaigner Khakan Qureshi seem to bear little real animosity towards him. \u201cHe has whipped up a hateful frenzy,\u201d says Qureshi, who is a social worker in Birmingham and repeatedly comes up against Afsar on social and broadcast media. \u201cAnd it\u2019s damaging for both of my communities ... but he has the gift of the gab.\u201d</p> <p>Qureshi grimaces. \u201cThis is made out to be a Muslim v gay issue when, actually, this prejudice and fear exists all over England. No one talks about how class or socioeconomics affect these attitudes.\u201d</p> <p>In May, the outgoing head of Stonewall, Ruth Hunt agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a religiously motivated battle,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>. Her experience was that working with schools across the country on LGBT-inclusive education was often difficult, sensitive work. \u201cThis necessity to take things down to its lowest common denominator dominates all discourse now, and it\u2019s just deeply annoying,\u201d she said.</p> <p>It\u2019s a nuance that Razzaq \u2013 who represents Supporting Education of Equality and Diversity in Schools (Seeds), a 1,000-member network that has been set up by teachers as a result of the Birmingham school protests \u2013 says is consistently missing from the debate. She grew up in the same area as Afsar and finds it \u201cdeeply upsetting\u201d to be at the intersection of two purportedly conflicting communities.</p> <p>\u201cBut the answers have to come from within our community,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has to be done sensitively, and we have to have those conversations as Muslims, British Pakistanis, as people from Birmingham. It can\u2019t be done through the white saviours who are holding counter-protests at the school. That\u2019s not helping, it reeks of a colonial mindset to me. Did they not think how that looks?\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Brown, regional organiser for the Musicians\u2019 Union, is among the dozen people singing peace songs in the protest exclusion zone near Anderton Park\u2019s school. The group haven\u2019t engaged with any of the passing parents, he says, \u201cbut you have to start somewhere. The message of the songs is about bringing people together and supporting inclusivity.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, outside the school gates, a Pakistani couple who don\u2019t want to give their names, sigh and roll their eyes when asked about Afsar. \u201cThe Pakistani community back home always looks for leaders, so this is why he thinks he is <em>shahenshah</em> [a king] now,\u201d says the father. \u201cBut we are not interested. The teachers are good. School is good. No, we don\u2019t want our children taught these things and confused at a little age, but we have no choice.\u201d</p> <p>By 2020, every school will be mandated to update its relationship and sex education (RSE) lessons. According to the Department for Education, primary schools will be \u201cencouraged to cover LGBT content if they consider it age-appropriate to do so, but there is no specific requirement for this.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, says Hewitt-Clarkson, ministers are hanging teachers like her out to dry. \u201cBy leaving this grey area and allowing this vast interpretation, you could end up with what\u2019s happening here [at schools] across the country. If it was compulsory, as it should be under the Equality Act, there would not be a debate.\u201d</p> <h2>Timeline</h2> <p><strong>February 2019</strong></p> <p>Muslim and Christian protesters demonstrate outside Parkfield school, Birmingham, against the No Outsiders programme</p> <p><strong>March</strong></p> <p>No Outsiders is suspended by Parkfield, but protests spread to Anderton Park</p> <p><strong>May</strong></p> <p>High Court bans protests outside Anderton Park, imposing an exclusion zone around the school</p> <p><strong>September</strong></p> <p>Protests resume at Anderton Park on Friday 13 September</p> <p><strong>October</strong></p> <p>The high court will consider whether the temporary exclusion zone should become permanent in the week beginning 14 October</p>",

Interrupted only by the summer holidays and a temporary high court injunction moving the drama away from the school gates, demonstrators have been preparing to rally again on Friday, two weeks before the case goes back to court. At the centre of all of it is Shakeel Afsar, a 32-year-old property developer. He doesn\u2019t have children at the school, but says he is the spokesperson for parents, including his sister Rosina. In a school where about 90% of the pupils are Muslim, predominantly from families with Mirpur heritage, the teachers have a difficult balancing act: how to respect the values of its parents, who come from what has been known as one of the most rural and conservative cultures in Pakistan, while preparing the children properly for modern life in Britain. At nearby Parkfield School, where the protests first began in March, a decision was made to suspend its \u201cNo Outsiders\u201d programme, an LGBTQ-inclusive scheme drawn up by assistant head Andrew Moffat, and reinstated over the summer term after months of consultation. But Anderton Park, which has been described as \u201ca leading light in Birmingham for its equalities work\u201d by the local authority, is not prepared to capitulate to what its head Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson calls \u201cdemands led by misinformation, deliberately misleading and intimidating parents, teachers and children.\u201d Afsar says his supporters \u201care the majority of parents at [Anderton Park] who weren\u2019t consulted by Hewitt-Clarkson about her LGBTQ agenda, and are upset that they\u2019re being ignored. Their four-year-old kids are coming home confused asking about two mummies and two daddies, and boys being girls and girls being boys. That\u2019s too young,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d From the bright pastel warmth of her office, Hewitt-Clarkson clarifies what she has been telling parents since the beginning of the year: The school isn\u2019t teaching the children about sex, gay sex, or gender reassignment. \u201cWhat we do have are books that might show a child with two mums or two dads, black families, Muslim families, white families \u2013 stories that show children the representation of all families,\u201d she says, exasperated. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an \u2018LGBT programme\u2019 \u2026 in 700 hours of staff training in my 13 years here, we\u2019ve done two hours of meetings on LGBT equality, and they say I am obsessed. That I am teaching children how to be gay.\u201d At the school gates, the picture seems mixed: parents are growing wary of talking to journalists. Some worry that their children will lose religious values taught at home. Others are growing dubious of Afsar and want the whole issue resolved. \u201cEveryone should respect everyone,\u201d says a mother who gives her name as Nafisa. \u201cBut how can children understand what is halal [permitted] and what is haram [forbidden] as Muslims when they are told this at school and that at home?\u201d Afsar\u2019s critics call him \u201ca failed YouTuber\u201d, and say he is intent on creating a circus around \u201cThe Shakeel Show\u201d \u2013 for notoriety, to launch a political career. His GoFundMe page, which crowd-sourced almost \u00a310,000 within a week to mount a legal case against the school before being closed down, had him bombarded with questions about his motives online, while a picture of him at home during Ramadan, bizarrely posing with Katie Hopkins, a right-wing commentator, soured some of the momentum behind him. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about the kids any more,\u201d says Saima Razzaq, a local Muslim activist who describes herself as \u201cqueer\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s about Shakeel\u2019s ego. I think he\u2019s a pawn \u2013 there are other figures involved in these protests who are trying to whip up this same hostility up and down the country.\u201d Seated behind his desk amid a clutter of files, boxes and a wall map of Kashmir, Afsar scoffs. \u201cListen, I have no interest in becoming a politician, or standing. This isn\u2019t about my career \u2013 I am a very successful businessman \u2013 I\u2019m just here fighting for parental rights.\u201d An hour later he giggles and asks me: \u201cDo you think I should become an MP? I think I\u2019ll do it, you know. I swear to God, maybe I\u2019ll stand when Roger Godsiff [the constituency MP] resigns. Have I got your vote?\u201d Afsar denies being homophobic. \u201cI have no issue with LGBT people and what they do \u2013 they should be able to thrive in this country. I\u2019m not an extremist or a mad man, I\u2019m not saying bring Sharia law here, we are a democratic country. In a democracy, LGBT people have the right to do what they want, and I have the right not to agree with it. I don\u2019t discriminate or want any harm to them. Just because I think a gay relationship is not a valid moral relationship does not mean I am homophobic.\u201d Despite his persistently circular logic and frequent contradictions, such is Afsar\u2019s inexplicable charm that even Razzaq and gay Muslim campaigner Khakan Qureshi seem to bear little real animosity towards him. \u201cHe has whipped up a hateful frenzy,\u201d says Qureshi, who is a social worker in Birmingham and repeatedly comes up against Afsar on social and broadcast media. \u201cAnd it\u2019s damaging for both of my communities ... but he has the gift of the gab.\u201d Qureshi grimaces. \u201cThis is made out to be a Muslim v gay issue when, actually, this prejudice and fear exists all over England. No one talks about how class or socioeconomics affect these attitudes.\u201d In May, the outgoing head of Stonewall, Ruth Hunt agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a religiously motivated battle,\u201d she told the Observer. Her experience was that working with schools across the country on LGBT-inclusive education was often difficult, sensitive work. \u201cThis necessity to take things down to its lowest common denominator dominates all discourse now, and it\u2019s just deeply annoying,\u201d she said. It\u2019s a nuance that Razzaq \u2013 who represents Supporting Education of Equality and Diversity in Schools (Seeds), a 1,000-member network that has been set up by teachers as a result of the Birmingham school protests \u2013 says is consistently missing from the debate. She grew up in the same area as Afsar and finds it \u201cdeeply upsetting\u201d to be at the intersection of two purportedly conflicting communities. \u201cBut the answers have to come from within our community,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has to be done sensitively, and we have to have those conversations as Muslims, British Pakistanis, as people from Birmingham. It can\u2019t be done through the white saviours who are holding counter-protests at the school. That\u2019s not helping, it reeks of a colonial mindset to me. Did they not think how that looks?\u201d Stephen Brown, regional organiser for the Musicians\u2019 Union, is among the dozen people singing peace songs in the protest exclusion zone near Anderton Park\u2019s school. The group haven\u2019t engaged with any of the passing parents, he says, \u201cbut you have to start somewhere. The message of the songs is about bringing people together and supporting inclusivity.\u201d Meanwhile, outside the school gates, a Pakistani couple who don\u2019t want to give their names, sigh and roll their eyes when asked about Afsar. \u201cThe Pakistani community back home always looks for leaders, so this is why he thinks he is shahenshah [a king] now,\u201d says the father. \u201cBut we are not interested. The teachers are good. School is good. No, we don\u2019t want our children taught these things and confused at a little age, but we have no choice.\u201d By 2020, every school will be mandated to update its relationship and sex education (RSE) lessons. According to the Department for Education, primary schools will be \u201cencouraged to cover LGBT content if they consider it age-appropriate to do so, but there is no specific requirement for this.\u201d In other words, says Hewitt-Clarkson, ministers are hanging teachers like her out to dry. \u201cBy leaving this grey area and allowing this vast interpretation, you could end up with what\u2019s happening here [at schools] across the country. If it was compulsory, as it should be under the Equality Act, there would not be a debate.\u201d Timeline February 2019 Muslim and Christian protesters demonstrate outside Parkfield school, Birmingham, against the No Outsiders programme March No Outsiders is suspended by Parkfield, but protests spread to Anderton Park May High Court bans protests outside Anderton Park, imposing an exclusion zone around the school September Protests resume at Anderton Park on Friday 13 September October The high court will consider whether the temporary exclusion zone should become permanent in the week beginning 14 October",

More than four years later, as it enters its final stage, the hearing has exposed the group\u2019s activities as never before. \u201cGolden Dawn\u2019s death is a natural death,\u201d said Ilias Stavrou, a former member who had once run on the party\u2019s ticket as a parliamentary candidate before also defecting. \u201cAs a political force it never managed to expand,\u201d the 32-year-old lawyer told the Observer. \u201cLess than 15% of its voters ever visited a party office and that\u2019s because there was always the dilemma of whether it should open up about its real ideology, which was all about Hitler and national socialism, or reject it and risk offending its hardcore members.\u201d Greece\u2019s rejuvenated anti-fascist movement is rejoicing. The defeat of the far-rightists \u2013 a blow for neo-fascist movements across Europe \u2013 has been attributed to the coordinated efforts of a diverse, anti-fascist and anti-racist movement that has also taken to the streets. \u201cGolden Dawn, as we know it, is over,\u201d smiles the prominent anti-fascist activist Petros Constantinou. \u201cWhenever they were on the streets, we too, were out in force. But the fight goes on. We still have to root out all those far-right people with links in the police and security services in this country. And lest we forget, please write about the victims. There were so many migrants, young people whose names we will never know, who died on these streets at the hands of Golden Dawn.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Fifteen years after the release of Tina Fey\u2019s cult film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/30/fetch-happens-why-mean-girls-is-the-perfect-teen-movie\" title=\"\"><em>Mean Girls</em></a>, where Lindsay Lohan\u2019s central character battled her peers, the all-powerful Plastics, is it time to move on from the Mean Girls caricature?</p> <p>Researchers at Florida Atlantic University found that, far from being ostracised, Mean Girl types are the most popular social group. FAU followed more than 560 pupils aged around 13 for two years, placing popular adolescents into three categories: \u201cprosocial (outgoing) popular\u201d, \u201caggressive popular\u201d and the \u201cbistrategic popular\u201d, or \u201cMachiavellian\u201d, with this latter group noted for being feared <em>and</em> loved. All very intriguing and it\u2019s good to see the Machiavellian label covering both sexes, perhaps finally putting the Mean Girl where she belongs \u2013 on a dusty shelf with other oversold pop-culture relics.</p> <p>I loved Fey\u2019s witty, brutal film \u2013 the characters were older than the adolescents in the Florida research and were inspired in part by the academic study of US high school behaviour, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/mar/04/gender.uk\" title=\"\"><em>Queen Bees and Wannabes</em></a>. However, all these years later, the MG stereotype has mutated far beyond the film and there seems something a little bit off, sexist and disturbing about it. After all, doesn\u2019t it amount to cultural permission to call a young girl a bitch? Certainly, it seems a gross distortion and over-simplification of the truth of what it is to be an adolescent girl.</p> <p>Of course, these days, anyone, of any age or sex, could get themselves labelled a Mean Girl. However, applied to girls, it becomes a reductive, inappropriate cliche, a way to dehumanise and trivialise adolescent females, often with an added sexualisation that verges on pornographic. However, my biggest problem with the Mean Girl is that, in her invulnerability, she\u2019s a dangerous, one-dimensional lie.</p> <p>There will always be young people conforming to stereotypes (to show off, to fit in, to hide), and good luck to them. However, in my experience, even when teenagers try to be MGs, it quickly becomes obvious that they\u2019re a lot more complicated, both in terms of behaviour and the reasons for that behaviour. In reality, many more adolescent personality types exist than is convenient for films or TV shows. This was true in my day, and from what I\u2019ve seen of my daughters and their friends, true now.</p> <p>Moreover, the Mean Girl stereotype obscures the real issue, which is that the major problem with many young girls today is lack of confidence, not overconfidence. Their inner MG may exist, but only in passing moments. The rest of the time, they\u2019re just teenagers, as vulnerable, complicated, lost, brilliant, hopeless and inspired as all the others.</p> <p>Put like that, it starts to feel weird and grotty, not to mention sexist and dated, to be casually flinging around a label like Mean Girl \u2013 that sly, somehow socially acceptable excuse to brand young females asirredeemably cold, manipulative and vicious. At least if we go with the term Machiavellians, the boys can share the dark teenage load.</p> <h2>Oh Madonna, don\u2019t be such a misery \u2013 let fans film you </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b58f34031b93cf35d186d3cae89e03e1a038715f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b58f34031b93cf35d186d3cae89e03e1a038715f/0_58_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madonna\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Madonna: thou shalt not film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/madonna-phone-ban-madame-x-tour-115249640.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvLnVrLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADir0wY4W91drOgOVa8NHuTiL27_u8ZNa8dGgEueyaULPXgSeHzJUKFDwfZMZ7d2ut-KLnWBLm6WbLrvnP6xg3Vn7gwBcjtQXMrbh1d0V1NHH3_CeMxvSHO63MmmzehZ3pW6bpBP6B1MCEHwvZoS-_654gSjt0dXbYdcRKB4iGvO\" title=\"\">Madonna is banning mobile phones from her Madame X world tour</a>.

Some were suspicious that No 10 was delaying the publication of an \u201cembarrassing\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/20/britons-consuming-more-sugar-despite-tax-and-anti-obesity-drive\" title=\"\">Public Health England report</a> showing how a sugar tax has been far more effective than just asking manufacturers (pretty please) to make food healthier. A compulsory levy on fizzy drinks reduced sugar 10 times faster than requesting companies to de-sweeten products voluntarily. While sugar consumption in England has risen, the sugar sold in soft drinks has decreased by 21.6%.</p> <p>Interesting, as was the mysterious delay in releasing this information. The report has been ready for a while, but requests for publication were rebuffed by No 10. The same No 10 that houses Boris Johnson, who\u2019s rather partial to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/03/boris-johnson-vows-to-review-whether-sugar-tax-improves-health\" title=\"\">railing against \u201csin taxes\u201d</a> and the \u201cgrowing creep of the nanny state\u201d.</p> <p>Could there possibly be a link? It was only when the delay was made public that the report very briskly made its way into the outside world, with Downing Street citing a \u201cbureaucratic hold-up\u201d. Well of course.</p> <p>The PHE report makes a mockery of the Tory \u201canti-obesity\u201d policy to \u201cvoluntarily challenge\u201d companies to cut sugar in products such as cakes, sweets and biscuits by 20% over five years.

      "bodyText": "Fifteen years after the release of Tina Fey\u2019s cult film Mean Girls, where Lindsay Lohan\u2019s central character battled her peers, the all-powerful Plastics, is it time to move on from the Mean Girls caricature? Researchers at Florida Atlantic University found that, far from being ostracised, Mean Girl types are the most popular social group. FAU followed more than 560 pupils aged around 13 for two years, placing popular adolescents into three categories: \u201cprosocial (outgoing) popular\u201d, \u201caggressive popular\u201d and the \u201cbistrategic popular\u201d, or \u201cMachiavellian\u201d, with this latter group noted for being feared and loved. All very intriguing and it\u2019s good to see the Machiavellian label covering both sexes, perhaps finally putting the Mean Girl where she belongs \u2013 on a dusty shelf with other oversold pop-culture relics. I loved Fey\u2019s witty, brutal film \u2013 the characters were older than the adolescents in the Florida research and were inspired in part by the academic study of US high school behaviour, Queen Bees and Wannabes. However, all these years later, the MG stereotype has mutated far beyond the film and there seems something a little bit off, sexist and disturbing about it. After all, doesn\u2019t it amount to cultural permission to call a young girl a bitch? Certainly, it seems a gross distortion and over-simplification of the truth of what it is to be an adolescent girl. Of course, these days, anyone, of any age or sex, could get themselves labelled a Mean Girl. However, applied to girls, it becomes a reductive, inappropriate cliche, a way to dehumanise and trivialise adolescent females, often with an added sexualisation that verges on pornographic. However, my biggest problem with the Mean Girl is that, in her invulnerability, she\u2019s a dangerous, one-dimensional lie. There will always be young people conforming to stereotypes (to show off, to fit in, to hide), and good luck to them. However, in my experience, even when teenagers try to be MGs, it quickly becomes obvious that they\u2019re a lot more complicated, both in terms of behaviour and the reasons for that behaviour. In reality, many more adolescent personality types exist than is convenient for films or TV shows. This was true in my day, and from what I\u2019ve seen of my daughters and their friends, true now. Moreover, the Mean Girl stereotype obscures the real issue, which is that the major problem with many young girls today is lack of confidence, not overconfidence. Their inner MG may exist, but only in passing moments. The rest of the time, they\u2019re just teenagers, as vulnerable, complicated, lost, brilliant, hopeless and inspired as all the others. Put like that, it starts to feel weird and grotty, not to mention sexist and dated, to be casually flinging around a label like Mean Girl \u2013 that sly, somehow socially acceptable excuse to brand young females asirredeemably cold, manipulative and vicious. At least if we go with the term Machiavellians, the boys can share the dark teenage load. Oh Madonna, don\u2019t be such a misery \u2013 let fans film you Madonna is banning mobile phones from her Madame X world tour. Who does she think she is \u2013 Madonna or something? The ban will make her 15-date residency at the London Palladium the UK\u2019s first big mobile-free concert. Audience members will put their phones into lockable fabric cases, which can only be opened by a magnetic device. Stars such as Jack White and Alicia Keys have also banned mobiles in the US, while Adele ticked off a fan for filming her performance instead of watching it. The aim of mobile bans is to promote greater intimacy at gigs (also \u2013 psst! \u2013 sales of tour DVDs are falling). However, while there\u2019s something to be said for experiencing things in the moment, rather than via screens, there\u2019s also fan-economics to consider. Shows at this level are expensive \u2013 add travel, refreshments, merchandise and accommodation and it easily runs into hundreds of pounds. If fans have shelled out, then they should be allowed to snap away or film if they like. Besides, if it\u2019s intimacy you\u2019re after, listen to music with headphones on. Live, the audience is as much part of the performance as what\u2019s happening on stage. At these prices, the customer is always right, even if they are waving their phones, yelling: \u201cOver here, Madge!\u201d during your heartrending ballad. It seems Boris Johnson knows sweet FA about sugar taxes Brace yourselves for the shocking revelation that a sugar tax, forcing food companies to, you know, \u201cdo stuff\u201d, tends to get a better result than merely requesting that food companies put their houses in order \u2013 but only if they feel like it. Some were suspicious that No 10 was delaying the publication of an \u201cembarrassing\u201d Public Health England report showing how a sugar tax has been far more effective than just asking manufacturers (pretty please) to make food healthier. A compulsory levy on fizzy drinks reduced sugar 10 times faster than requesting companies to de-sweeten products voluntarily. While sugar consumption in England has risen, the sugar sold in soft drinks has decreased by 21.6%. Interesting, as was the mysterious delay in releasing this information. The report has been ready for a while, but requests for publication were rebuffed by No 10. The same No 10 that houses Boris Johnson, who\u2019s rather partial to railing against \u201csin taxes\u201d and the \u201cgrowing creep of the nanny state\u201d. Could there possibly be a link? It was only when the delay was made public that the report very briskly made its way into the outside world, with Downing Street citing a \u201cbureaucratic hold-up\u201d. Well of course. The PHE report makes a mockery of the Tory \u201canti-obesity\u201d policy to \u201cvoluntarily challenge\u201d companies to cut sugar in products such as cakes, sweets and biscuits by 20% over five years. Two years on, PHE feels that believes this target is unlikely to be met. Overall, sugar has been reduced by a mere 3%, with only breakfast cereals and yoghurts hitting the mark. The good news is that Johnson had previously argued that exercise was a \u201cfar, far better solution\u201d, and demanded to see evidence that strategies such as sugar taxation \u201cactually stops people from being so fat\u201d. It would appear the PM now has all the evidence he needs. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "On Friday night in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Angelica Ross became the first trans person to host a presidential forum. The star of the FX series Pose kicked off the LGBTQ presidential forum by reflecting on the murders of 19 trans women (18 of them black) in 2019. \u201cBlack trans lives matter,\u201d she roared, to deafening applause, setting the tone for the night. The forum highlighted a new era in LGBTQ politics, no longer concerned with respectability, focused instead on difficult, previously ignored or under-highlighted issues, including homelessness among young LGBTQ people. Former vice-president Joe Biden was confronted about voting for the Defense of Marriage Act and don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell. Senator Kamala Harris was taken to task for denying inmates gender reassignment surgery when she was California attorney general. The two-hour forum was the first dedicated to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender voters since 2007, when same-sex marriage was illegal. \u201cAmericans think that marriage equality was the finish line for the LGBTQ community,\u201d said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of the advocacy group Glaad, a co-organizer of the forum. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize we can get fired or put through so-called conversion therapy. That\u2019s why this forum was so important.\u201d In her own Q&amp;A, Ross spoke to the Guardian. How did it feel to be part of such a historic moment? About damn time is how I feel! And not just for myself \u2013 but for black trans women whose voices have been so powerful, necessary and missing in this movement. It was great to start the show off with the tone that we need to be aware of the issues facing black trans folk. And then to see all of the candidates pretty much address that issue or have something to say towards it. I thought everyone did an incredible job. One of the most visceral statements came from Elizabeth Warren, who read the names of 18 trans women of color killed this year. What did you think of that?

      "body": "<p>Artist James Merry, 37, has been working with Bj\u00f6rk since 2009; they were introduced by a mutual friend while Merry was studying ancient Greek at Oxford University. He moved to New York to work with her, and played a vital part in her 2011 album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/06/bjork-biophilia-cd-review\" title=\"\"><em>Biophilia</em></a>, on which each song was accompanied by an interactive app uniting concepts of music, science and nature. Merry has remained Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s right-hand man through her 2015 breakup album <em>Vulnicura</em> and this year\u2019s <em>Utopia</em>, as well as making her elaborate masks and headpieces. Their latest project is a full virtual reality version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/22/bjork-vulnicura-review-breakup-album\" title=\"\"><em>Vulnicura</em></a> in which seven VR videos by different directors follow Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s path through heartbreak and recovery in the Icelandic landscape, from a verdant valley into a dark lava tube and out the other side. Merry lives and works in Iceland.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Why did Bj\u00f6rk decide to make <em>Vulnicura</em> into virtual reality? Most VR experiences focus on spectacle or action, </strong><strong>and it\u2019s such an inward, emotional album.</strong><br>In 2014, we got an Oculus Rift headset and set it up in her kitchen in New York \u2026 she just got a gut reaction to it, and it also happened to really suit the nature and content of the <em>Vulnicura</em> album. It wasn\u2019t a gimmick, it wasn\u2019t like: \u201cOh, VR is hot, let\u2019s force ourselves to do VR videos\u201d; it was actually more like the weird, airless, almost suffocating and isolating early VR stuff we tried, she realised it could really fit these heartbreak songs... it was just a really good overlap between the medium and the content.

      "bodyText": "Artist James Merry, 37, has been working with Bj\u00f6rk since 2009; they were introduced by a mutual friend while Merry was studying ancient Greek at Oxford University. He moved to New York to work with her, and played a vital part in her 2011 album, Biophilia, on which each song was accompanied by an interactive app uniting concepts of music, science and nature. Merry has remained Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s right-hand man through her 2015 breakup album Vulnicura and this year\u2019s Utopia, as well as making her elaborate masks and headpieces. Their latest project is a full virtual reality version of Vulnicura in which seven VR videos by different directors follow Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s path through heartbreak and recovery in the Icelandic landscape, from a verdant valley into a dark lava tube and out the other side. Merry lives and works in Iceland. Why did Bj\u00f6rk decide to make Vulnicura into virtual reality? Most VR experiences focus on spectacle or action, and it\u2019s such an inward, emotional album. In 2014, we got an Oculus Rift headset and set it up in her kitchen in New York \u2026 she just got a gut reaction to it, and it also happened to really suit the nature and content of the Vulnicura album. It wasn\u2019t a gimmick, it wasn\u2019t like: \u201cOh, VR is hot, let\u2019s force ourselves to do VR videos\u201d; it was actually more like the weird, airless, almost suffocating and isolating early VR stuff we tried, she realised it could really fit these heartbreak songs... it was just a really good overlap between the medium and the content. I think people are still figuring out how VR is going to position itself in our lives, whether it\u2019s for hardcore gamers who are in there for eight days without eating, or whether it\u2019s a thing in the living room that you order stuff on, or a paintballing businessmen-bonding-trip kind of thing.

Her new novel, <em>The Dutch House</em>, is a masterful depiction of ruptured family relationships, the power of sibling bonds and the nature of home.</p> <p><strong>The protagonists in </strong><em><strong>The Dutch House</strong></em><strong> become obsessed with their childhood home after they\u2019re turfed out by their stepmother. Do you think people too often get </strong><strong>fixated on the past?</strong><br>So many people just get stuck in their childhood and shoulder that burden through everything. It becomes their defining feature in life. Danny and Maeve [the novel\u2019s main characters] chew on their loss of the house: they make it a fetish. I see people doing that and I just think, You can\u2019t still be feeling this loss. You\u2019ve made this your hobby.</p> <p><strong>Property is both a sanctuary and a burden in the novel.

Do you think memory is ultimately unreliable?</strong><br>Yes, I think that memory is almost a living thing for every person. I was in downtown New York on September 11 with a friend and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/september11\" title=\"\">we were there at the World Trade Cent</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/september11\" title=\"\">er</a> when it fell. We had this huge life-changing day together. Several years later, we sat down and we talked about that day and it was as if we had been on different planets. We remembered every single thing about the day differently. Memory is unreliable and yet we are completely positive that we are right.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Give me a story about a rabbit who\u2019s had a very hard time of it and I will be weeping</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>One of the novel\u2019s central questions is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/how-do-you-deal-with-grief-fall-apart-under-its-weight-or-stay-strong\" title=\"\">how we deal with grief</a>. Do you think culturally we are ill-equipped</strong><strong>?</strong><br>We don\u2019t have enough time to deal with our grief. We\u2019re almost embarrassed by grief. It\u2019s so strange. We have two things absolutely in common: we\u2019re born and we die. And everyone goes through those two experiences in a remarkably similar way, with a few medical details to separate us. But the facts are the facts: we weren\u2019t here and then we\u2019re not here again. But we can\u2019t bear to think about it.</p> <p><strong>You</strong><strong> have said in the past that you can\u2019t write villains. But </strong><strong>Andrea Conroy</strong><strong> is an almost fairytale wicked stepmother. Why did you feel able to write a villain now?</strong><br>I was interviewing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/21/zadie-smith-you-ask-the-questions-self-doubt\" title=\"\">Zadie Smith</a> about the idea of writing an autobiographical novel. She said she was writing about the kind of mother she was afraid of being. You can write something very autobiographical that has never happened to you because it\u2019s what you\u2019re afraid of. And I wanted to write about the kind of stepmother that I would be afraid of being.</p> <p><strong>There are many fairytale elements in the book. Did you feel </strong><strong>as if you were writing a modern-day fairytale?</strong><br>Yes. I grew up on lives of the saints, which are fairytales. Whether it\u2019s Hansel and Gretel or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/25/francis-a-life-in-songs-ann-wroe-saint-assisi\" title=\"\">Saint Francis</a> throwing out the last of his bread for the birds \u2013 it all comes together. Catholicism: it\u2019s just kind of a big fairytale. The parables: fairytales. I\u2019m a very plot-driven person and I think it all goes back to fairytales and parables and saints.</p> <p><strong>So were you reading parables rather than fairytales growing up?</strong><br>I was reading them all interchangeably. When you think about it, they really are just the same. There are morals, the good people are lifted up, the bad people get their justice in the end, there\u2019s a certain amount of magic involved. I can scarcely remember which goes into which camp.</p> <p><strong>Which writers have most influenced you</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Philip Roth, John Updike and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/17/the-five-essential-saul-bellow-novels\" title=\"\">Saul Bellow</a>. Those were the authors my parents were reading when I was in high school and so those were the books that were lying around. I think influence has more to do with when you read something than who you read.</p> <p><strong>Which writers working today do you admire the most?</strong><br>Zadie Smith, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/20/colson-whitehead-reality-is-kids-shot-by-racist-cops\" title=\"\">Colson Whitehead</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/02/elizabeth-strout-war-peace-books-that-made-me\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Strout</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/17/goldfinch-donna-tartt-review\" title=\"\">Donna Tartt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/12/michael-chabon-pops-fatherhood-piece-parenting-teenagers-essays\" title=\"\">Michael Chabon</a>.

We don\u2019t have enough time to deal with our grief. We\u2019re almost embarrassed by grief. It\u2019s so strange. We have two things absolutely in common: we\u2019re born and we die. And everyone goes through those two experiences in a remarkably similar way, with a few medical details to separate us. But the facts are the facts: we weren\u2019t here and then we\u2019re not here again. But we can\u2019t bear to think about it. You have said in the past that you can\u2019t write villains. But Andrea Conroy is an almost fairytale wicked stepmother. Why did you feel able to write a villain now? I was interviewing Zadie Smith about the idea of writing an autobiographical novel. She said she was writing about the kind of mother she was afraid of being. You can write something very autobiographical that has never happened to you because it\u2019s what you\u2019re afraid of. And I wanted to write about the kind of stepmother that I would be afraid of being. There are many fairytale elements in the book. Did you feel as if you were writing a modern-day fairytale? Yes. I grew up on lives of the saints, which are fairytales. Whether it\u2019s Hansel and Gretel or Saint Francis throwing out the last of his bread for the birds \u2013 it all comes together. Catholicism: it\u2019s just kind of a big fairytale. The parables: fairytales. I\u2019m a very plot-driven person and I think it all goes back to fairytales and parables and saints. So were you reading parables rather than fairytales growing up? I was reading them all interchangeably. When you think about it, they really are just the same. There are morals, the good people are lifted up, the bad people get their justice in the end, there\u2019s a certain amount of magic involved. I can scarcely remember which goes into which camp. Which writers have most influenced you? Philip Roth, John Updike and Saul Bellow. Those were the authors my parents were reading when I was in high school and so those were the books that were lying around. I think influence has more to do with when you read something than who you read. Which writers working today do you admire the most? Zadie Smith, Colson Whitehead, Elizabeth Strout, Donna Tartt, Michael Chabon. I could go on. What do you read for sheer pleasure? Anything and everything by Kate DiCamillo. Give me a story about a rabbit who\u2019s had a very hard time of it and I will be weeping. Give me a story about a mouse who has his tail cut off trying to save a princess: it means the world to me. Has owning a bookshop changed your relationship to books? I used to live my life reading EM Forster and Henry James. That\u2019s what I used to read and love and dream about. Now I read everything in galleys [advanced copies]. I read 10 or 20 pages of something, chuck it aside and start the next thing. Is there a book you wish you\u2019d written? Old Filth by Jane Gardam. It\u2019s absolutely perfect. It\u2019s one of those books that I think of as a universal donor: everyone I give that book to is thrilled by it. It\u2019s a rare book that covers birth to death which is frankly impossible to do. And a book you think is overrated? I\u2019m way too polite for that. Is there a very famous book \u2013 contemporary or classic \u2013 that you\u2019ve never got around to reading? How much time do you have? All I do is read and all I do is realise how much I haven\u2019t read. I\u2019ve only read one Trollope novel. Who would you like to write the story of your life? David Sedaris. I love him and he\u2019d embarrass me to death. What\u2019s the last great book you read? The Resisters by Gish Jen. It\u2019s coming out in February. It\u2019s a book that means to save the world. I can\u2019t begin to tell you how brilliant it is. What books are on your bedside table to read next? The Giver of Stars by Jojo Moyes and Deep River by Karl Marlantes. I\u2019m currently reading American Dirt by Jeanine Cummins: it\u2019s fantastic. \u2022 The Dutch House by Ann Patchett is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a318.99).

They strolled in midweek with Fernandinho in central defence against Shakhtar Donetsk, but <strong>Watford</strong>\u2019s burly forwards might make life a little different for the Brazilian. What does that dreamboat Quique Sanchez Flores have planned? Real man Toy Deeney would have fancied a pop. <br><br>Mind, City have not lost to Watford since 1989 and have won the last 11 meetings. scoring 38 goals.<br><br>What next for <strong>Norwich</strong> and Teemu Pukki? <strong>Burnley</strong> could provide something of a rough landing. Dycheball v Farkeball, a clash of styles. Burnley have not won since opening day but their equaliser at Brighton last week through Jeff Hendrick was the type of sweeping goal that Norwich have become noted for. <br><br>Marco Silva\u2019s sheen is being tarnished by <strong>Everton</strong> being, well, Everton again. They were hopeless last week at Bournemouth, frankly. <strong>Sheffield</strong> <strong>United</strong>, after their bright start, know they are in the Premier League now, and were on the end of VAR last week against Southampton. No Billy Sharp for them, either, after his red card in that game. <br><br>The Championship, after<strong> </strong>Leeds take on strugglers Derby in that early game, will see <strong>Swansea</strong>, who began the day level on points, taking on <strong>Bristol City</strong>. At the bottom, how can <strong>Stoke</strong> get on at <strong>Brentford</strong>. Or has Nathan Jones been going on too long? <br><br>In League One, <strong>Ipswich</strong> have chance to go back to the top with their match at <strong>Gillingham </strong>and in League Two, leaders <strong>Exeter</strong> are at <strong>Newport</strong>. <br><br>All that and the latest from Germany and Scotland, too. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-21T10:55:06.319Z\">at 11.55am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "OK, that concludes the clockwatch for today. We almost saw history together. Thanks for reading. Paul Wilson was at Goodison Park. Ben Fisher was at Ashton Gate. Report on Burnley 2-0 Norwich. Bernardo Silva, the hat-trick hero speaks to the BBC: It was a great performance, 8-0 says everything. It\u2019s very good to get the three points after defeat at Norwich and I\u2019m very happy with my first hat-trick of my career. My first match ball at home. All teams have good and bad moments, the way you react to the bad is the most important thing. Once again this team showed we want to fight for the Premier League and all the titles. Those Manchester City 8-0 Watford stats in full. Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster has bravely fronted up to speak to Sky Sports. It\u2019s probably a bit of shock, embarrassment. I think we let ourselves down today and the fans a bit. The fans were giving it everything, all they\u2019ve got, unfortunately we on the pitch didn\u2019t give it all we have got. As a keeper coming to City and Liverpool, if you let five in in 20 minutes you fear the worst, you think cricket scores. They are without doubt the best team I have ever played against. We were poor, didn\u2019t lay a glove on them but at times it was breathtaking watching them. You come away to City and I\u2019m not joking, you come here and think if you keep it to two or three - they are so good. Them and Liverpool are a different level. We didn\u2019t do our job today. We have to take some positives but that\u2019s football. You have to clean yourselves up, move onto the next one. We have a few experienced lads but you have to keep smiling. I have just let eight in. I\u2019m not happy but it is what it is. There is no point in dwelling, get ready for the next game and get ready. Brad Wilson on Everton: \u201cDismal. Lack of, well, everything. Sam Allardyce did better.\u201d It hardly needs saying that Watford stayed bottom of the Premier League but Everton in 14th is a tale of woe and will lead to a week of speculation over Marco Silva. A mention for Southend United, who got a first win of the season in winning 1-0 at MK Dons. They had to hang on after Charlie Kelman\u2019s fourth-minute goal. Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s report from the Etihad. News from Germany: Bayern Munich beat FC Cologne 4-0, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice and then letting Philippe Coutinho take a penalty to score a first goal for Bayern. They are top of the table after Freibug could only draw 1-1 with Augsburg. David Hindle protests too much: \u201cThis isn\u2019t sour grapes, but surely the problem is losing last week, 3-2 to Norwich? 9-0 or 10-0 this week won\u2019t make that go away. And Liverpool might well edge the match tomorrow by the odd goal. And still be 5 points ahead. That\u2019s without even mentioning Champions League QF\u2019s.\u201d Norwich undone by Dycheball, muscled out of it and very disappointing while Burnley were excellent. A big day for Chris Wilder and Phil Jagielka, potential doomsday for Marco Silva. That\u2019s it. A record win for City, a record loss for Watford and still, it could have been more. Disaster for Bolton, as Sunderland equalise through a penalty from Aiden McGeady. Another 1-1 for Sunderland, then, and a fairytale denied. \u201cCome on City,\u201d sing their fans. They want nine, they want nine. Swansea down to ten men at Bristol City after Jake Bidwell has been dismissed. They might fancy hanging on for that 0-0 now. De Bruyne almost makes it nine for Manchester City after a solo run, and nine looked on as he gave Ben Foster the eyes and then missed the target. The Belgian has been the architect of this slaughter. There is just a minute left of normal time left. Pablo Miguez says: \u201cI remember a few years ago two Barcelona players got balls for scoring a hat-trick in the same match. Imho, the losing goalkeeper should get one too, as a consolation, since he could not get close to the ball during the match obviously...\u201d A right-foot smasher into the roof of the net and City have their record number of goals in a Premier League match. Can you be accused of bottling it when you fail to win 10-0? Go on, then, yes you can. Manchester City\u2019s next game? Everton, so perhaps they can attempt to score ten against them. Barry Bryan: \u201cAgree that if we\u2019re going to have VAR, it should be limited like cricket. But I think 3 is far too many. You\u2019d virtually guarantee every goal gets reviewed (I mean, in normal matches). One per half? One per game?\u201d What did we talk about before VAR? A defensive shambles as Mousset sashays through some awful defending. Boooo! Oh dear, Marco. There are 14 minutes left for Manchester City to either level or surpass that record 9-0 margin of victory from Manchester United. Ben Foster in the Craig Forrest role? Phil Jagielka, on as a sub and sat in front of the Sheffield United defence in midfield, has been outstanding at an ever more insurrectional Goodison Park. Burnley have been denied what looked a certain penalty when Ashley Barnes was on the receiving end in the Norwich box. They still lead 2-0. Championship: Swansea and Bristol City still deadlocked, as are Stoke and Brentford, while Nottingham Forest are well set, leading Barnsley 1-0 and set to climb up for fourth. \u201cSerious question here,\u201d asks Jeremy Dresner.\u201d If more than two hatricks are scored who gets the match ball? How is it decided? Do they both get one? Asking for a sky blue team.\u201d Must be a Coventry fan. Maybe look back to Paul Stewart, David White and Tony Adcock and the 10-1 v Huddersfield in 1987. \u201cThis Evertonian would have started Iwobi and used just 1 holding midfielder, especially at home,\u201d says Brad Wilson. \u201cSilva\u2019s tactics seem senseless and then he winds up panicking. Not a productive combination.\u201d Riyad Mahrez hits the bar with a header from an Angelino cross. City now wasteful? There\u2019s the not unfamiliar sound of boos coming from the Goodison not-so faithful. A loss to Sheffield United would be a severe blow to Marco Silva\u2019s cachet and he seems powerless to change matters. As a response to last week\u2019s embarrassment, City could hardly have been more emphatic. A hat-trick for Bernardo and there are 30 minutes left to get three more goals. They were queuing up to score that. Bernardo got two goes. The neighbours are now so noisy that next door have their earplugs on. Marco Silva is forced to go for broke against Sheffield United. John Cox on VAR: \u201cOf course it\u2019s not sensible to say VAR offsides only count if it\u2019s at least 10 cm. What if it\u2019s 10.01? What would be sensible is a complete moratorium on tiresome whinging by commentators and ex-pros.\u201d Pep\u2019s defensive experiments to continue as Cancelo is due to come on. If you can\u2019t do that at 6-0 up then when can you? Big goal, big noise as Bolton take the lead against Sunderland, for only their second goal of their season. Jack Hobbs got it. Sunderland concede again as they have in every game this season. Awful defending and Bernardo offered the freedom of Manchester to score his second. Watford doing anything other than trying to keep it tight and make sure they don\u2019t lose the second half. Manchester City have made a change, bringing on Angelino for Benjamin Mendy. It looks a tactical change and one to give the returned Spaniard a run-out... The second halves are back underway.... Mark Rossell on the inescapable issue of VAR: \u201cWouldn\u2019t the cricketing system work for football? Ref\u2019s call if it\u2019s a matter of 10 cm or less? and only 3 per side VAR reviews?\u201d Seems all too sensible to these eyes, Mark. Pete Spencer: \u201cIs there time for Watford to sign Ben Stokes for the second half?\u201d They could have done with Chris Tavare in the first half. Report on that late-arriving Derby draw at Leeds Other games of note: Stoke are 0-0 at Brentford as they try to turn around their fortunes. Swansea are being held to the same scoreline at Bristol City. Ipswich lead 1-0 at Gillingham while League Two leaders are 1-0 up on Exeter. Let us now give praise to Watford for not conceding for a further 27 minutes (plus three of time added on) after letting in five after 18 minutes. Boos at Goodison. Everton are doing an Everton. Last week seems a long time ago for Norwich, who have been given quite the going over at Turf Moor. Manchester City, chasing a Premier League record six-goal half-time, lead are into three minutes of injury time. Richarlison has just blown a chance to equalise almost immediately for Everton against Sheffield United. Two Rooneys have scored today. John Rooney, brother of Wayne, for Barrow in their National League game at Ebbsfleet, and Adam Rooney, for Salford (no relation), who has just scored his first in the EFL. Confusion after Jordan Pickford misses the ball, and it comes off Yerry Mina for an own-goal. There was a lengthy delay for VAR but the fault was entirely with Everton\u2019s chaotic defending. Some City stats for your delight and delectation. Ipswich are beating Gillingham 1-0 thanks to a goal from Kane Vincent-Young. They are on course to go back to the top of League One. This was a debut to forget. Dimitri Foulquier is not injured. Mark O\u2019Brien asks: \u201cWhat are the current odds for a Watford win?\u201d Answer: 1000/1 on a popular betting exchange. 500/1 elsewhere. Skinny odds all round. Paul Fitzgerald: \u201cMaybe City and Watford should do what we did as kids and swap players around at half-time. De Bruyne for Cleverley perhaps.\u201d Gareth Williams, Watford fan, has this to say: \u201cI\u2019ve lost the will to live...\u201d No Manchester City goal for ten minutes now, making a mockery of the competition, ruining football etc etc. They are not slackening off just yet. Sergio Aguero has gone close twice for City, first missing when Ben Foster already looked beaten and then hitting the post with the second attempt. Mary Waltz has diagnosed Watford\u2019s problem: \u201cPep was so calm and gracious in defeat last week. He completely masked his rage and City was in Pep\u2019s dental chair all week and they are making Watford pay for their discomfort.\u201d Norwich hit the post, as sub Moritz Leitner, from long range and on as a sub for the injured Alex Tettey, goes close to grabbing a lifeline. Burnley have been dominant. Kean goes close for Everton, and then there\u2019s a melee as Bernard chases the ball down with a booking for him and Baldock after they battle for the ball. There are claims of flailing elbows but instead it\u2019s yellow rather than red. It\u2019s a tap-in from yards out. Have Watford given up completely? City could beat that United record from 24 years ago by half-time. Ok, Everton and Sheffield United, it\u2019s over to you. The other two games look to be done. The word is that it\u2019s an even contest. This is getting very embarrassing now. Already. Anyone got Javi Gracia\u2019s phone number? Dwight McNeil\u2019s ball, Wood\u2019s left-footed finish. Too easy. A deflected free-kick and already City look to be going for the all-time scoring record in the Premier League. Remember: that was Manchester United 9-0 Ipswich in 1995. Burnley go down the other end and score through a Chris Wood header. After the Bernard Matthews show for Norwich? Norwich go close, with Pukki let through by a mistake from James Tarkowski, but a fine save from Nick Pope averts the danger. Ashley Barnes of Burnley has suffered a badly cut nose but he will not be stopped from playing on, will he? Riyad Mahrez was fouled by Ben Foster, and up steps Aguero to score. He has scored in every league game this season for City, all six. That Watford resistance did not last long at all. Foden update from Gavin Coyle: \u201cPhil Foden\u2019s sick, Pep mentioned it in his press conference yesterday - same reason he didn\u2019t travel to Ukraine. He should start midweek though.\u201c Everton are pushing on against Sheffield United, with Moise Kean to the fore and meanwhile at the Etihad, Gerard Deulofeu might have done better than hit the ball straight at City goalkeeper Ederson. City\u2019s defence creaking? It looks that way. Kevin de Bruyne\u2019s cross and David Silva\u2019s tap-in, and it came after 54 seconds. The continuation of that Watford losing streak already looks set in stone. In the Premier League, the teams are taking to the field. We are some back-slapping and mentions of official sponsors away from kick-off. Phil Grey writes in on the VAR-ce in the Leicester game : \u201cI think we witnessed a defining moment in post VAR football when Rob wrote GOAL? instead of GOAL! during the early kick-off. As a Man City fan I\u2019ve already started shouting Yesss? instead of Yesss! every time we score.\u201d Agree. I actually think all that jiggery pokery over the non-goal for Aurier has swung what was a neutral opinion on the matter. Couple of tweets, one by me, forgive my self-indulgence. This came before today\u2019s shenanigans from one of VAR\u2019s most knowledgeable advocates. Gabriel Jesus is not selected to start today by Manchester City. Pep Guardiola provides an explanation here. There is, though, no explanation for the lack of Phil Foden. The likes of Mason Mount and James Maddison are older, of course, but are getting games and that is aiding their development this season. Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from the King Power Stadium. Barry Glendenning on the unlikelihood of Watford beating City is worth a read. And Leicester have beaten Tottenham, who haven\u2019t won away in the league since January. Rob Smyth will bring you the reaction. James Maddison, a star is born - or came via Coventry and Norwich. In the Championship, it\u2019s finished 1-1 between Leeds and Derby, after Chris Martin equalised in injury time. He never meant to cause them trouble, he never meant to cause them pain...over to you, Swansea, who are at Bristol City today. It\u2019s all go in the early Premier League game. The headline selections among that lot are Moise Kean\u2019s start for Everton and the expected news - well, who else is there? - that Fernandinho will play in central defence for Manchester City. Burnley v Norwich teams Burnley: Pope, Lowton, Mee, Tarkowski, Pieters, Hendrick, Westwood, Cork, McNeil, Wood, Barnes. Sub: Hart, Taylor, Brady, Rodriguez, Lennon, Vydra, Long.

This month marks 125 years of Manchester City. Of course, Oasis have to be involved in this video. Marco Silva is feeling the pressure somewhat. Previews ahead of the Premier League team announcements. The week\u2019s European action has decimated the traditional Saturday 3pm slot, but there is still much to play for this afternoon. Manchester City have a five-point deficit to make up on Liverpool after last week\u2019s defeat at Norwich City. They strolled in midweek with Fernandinho in central defence against Shakhtar Donetsk, but Watford\u2019s burly forwards might make life a little different for the Brazilian. What does that dreamboat Quique Sanchez Flores have planned? Real man Toy Deeney would have fancied a pop. Mind, City have not lost to Watford since 1989 and have won the last 11 meetings. scoring 38 goals. What next for Norwich and Teemu Pukki? Burnley could provide something of a rough landing. Dycheball v Farkeball, a clash of styles. Burnley have not won since opening day but their equaliser at Brighton last week through Jeff Hendrick was the type of sweeping goal that Norwich have become noted for. Marco Silva\u2019s sheen is being tarnished by Everton being, well, Everton again. They were hopeless last week at Bournemouth, frankly. Sheffield United, after their bright start, know they are in the Premier League now, and were on the end of VAR last week against Southampton. No Billy Sharp for them, either, after his red card in that game. The Championship, after Leeds take on strugglers Derby in that early game, will see Swansea, who began the day level on points, taking on Bristol City. At the bottom, how can Stoke get on at Brentford. Or has Nathan Jones been going on too long? In League One, Ipswich have chance to go back to the top with their match at Gillingham and in League Two, leaders Exeter are at Newport. All that and the latest from Germany and Scotland, too.",

      "bodyText": "A man who confronted Boris Johnson over the state of the NHS after years of austerity has said that his daughter is doing better. Omar Salem confronted the prime minister during a visit to a children\u2019s ward at Whipps Cross University hospital in north-east London, where his seven-day-old daughter was being treated. Salem took the prime minister to task, complaining there were not enough doctors and nurses in a conversation lasting about two minutes. Salem said the situation was not acceptable and told the prime minister: \u201cMy daughter nearly died yesterday. And I came here, the A&amp;E guys were great but we then came down to this ward here and it took two hours [inaudible] and that is just not acceptable. This ward is not safe for children. \u201cThere was one registrar covering the entirety of this ward and the neonatal unit. That is just not acceptable, is it? There are not enough people on this ward, not enough doctors, not enough nurses and it\u2019s not well organised enough.\u201d Salem tweeted on Saturday: \u201cOur daughter is very much better, which is a great relief. \u201cThank you to the ambulance/A&amp;E staff and the ward staff who cared for her over the last few days.

In a statement anticipating Kennedy\u2019s challenge, he said he would \u201crun on all the issues I\u2019ve been fighting for today and into the future\u201d, which he listed as \u201cclimate change, income inequality, a woman\u2019s right to choose and on gun safety legislation.</p> <p>\u201cI am going to continue those fights into this campaign and I will do so every day that I\u2019m out there crisscrossing the state of Massachusetts and fighting for the people of our state.\u201d</p> <p>Kennedy and Markey are not far apart ideologically but the challenger sees a national Democratic party with more energetic leadership, standing up to Republicans who have chosen to back Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cThis about leadership,\u201d a Democratic operative familiar with Kennedy\u2019s thinking told the Guardian on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s why he was asked to offer the party\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s state of the union address [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/31/joe-kennedy-response-state-of-the-union\">in 2018</a>], and should be seen in the context of the post-2016 election [era].\u201d</p> <p>The challenge for Kennedy will be to articulate a compelling reason, other than his bloodline, for seeking to knock Markey out. The congressman planned a seven-stop tour of Massachusetts on Saturday, meeting figures from Democratic state leadership.</p> <p>On Friday, Salem mayor Kim Driscoll co-authored an<a href=\"https://commonwealthmagazine.org/opinion/why-were-with-joe/\"> op-ed in Common</a><a href=\"https://commonwealthmagazine.org/opinion/why-were-with-joe/\">Wealth </a><a href=\"https://commonwealthmagazine.org/opinion/why-were-with-joe/\">magazine</a> in which she explained her endorsement of the congressman.</p> <p>\u201cAs mayors, our highest priority when it comes to partners in Congress is a leader who shows up. And Joe shows up for Massachusetts,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>His challenge will also invite criticism that he is embarking on an expensive and divisive fight at a time when the party should be united in seeking to unseat Trump and secure a majority in the Senate.</p> <p>Markey\u2019s supporters include his fellow Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who told reporters last month he had been \u201ca great partner in the Senate\u201d. But the presidential hopeful also acknowledged Kennedy, noting he had once been her student.</p> <p>\u201cI worked with Joe before either one of us was in politics and have worked with him ever since he\u2019s been in Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s really an amazing person.\u201d</p> <p>Markey has the support of the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who dominates the progressive wing of the party. He has also lined up <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EdMarkeyforMA/photos/pcb.1836748019762190/1836744623095863/?type=3&amp;theater\">more than 100 state legislators</a>, many of whom point to his leadership on climate change.</p> <p>\u201cWe are lucky to have one of the nation\u2019s strongest climate champions, Ed Markey, representing Massachusetts in the US Senate,\u201d Environment Massachusetts state director Ben Hellerstein said on Friday, saying the group would put $5m forward to support his reelection campaign.</p> <p>\u201cVoters need to know what Ed Markey has done throughout decades of public service to advance renewable energy, clean water, clean air, and the protection of our public lands.

      "bodyText": "Joe Kennedy announced on Saturday morning that he will contest the US Senate seat for Massachusetts held by Edward Markey, in what promises to be an intra-party fight exposing divisions in Democratic ranks. The 38-year-old congressman is a scion of one of America\u2019s most famous political families. He is a grandson of Robert F Kennedy, who was attorney general under his brother John F Kennedy, then a senator for New York and a presidential candidate before being assassinated, like his brother before him, in 1968. John and Robert\u2019s brother Ted was a prominent Massachusetts senator until his death in 2009. Joe Kennedy made official his challenge to Markey, 73, a co-sponsor with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the Green New Deal, on Saturday morning. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a time for waiting,\u201d Kennedy wrote, \u201cfor sitting on the sidelines, or for playing by rules that don\u2019t work any more. This is the fight of our lives, the fight of my generation \u2013 and I\u2019m all in.\u201d In a video, he added: \u201cIn this moment, we refuse to accept the status quo that tells us big things aren\u2019t possible. I\u2019m running for Senate because this is the fight of our lives.\u201d The son of former Massachusetts congressman Joe Kennedy II will pose a serious challenge. A Boston Globe and Suffolk University poll released earlier this month found Kennedy leading by 14 points in a head-to-head contest. Markey has been in Congress since 1976 and the Senate since 2013. In a statement anticipating Kennedy\u2019s challenge, he said he would \u201crun on all the issues I\u2019ve been fighting for today and into the future\u201d, which he listed as \u201cclimate change, income inequality, a woman\u2019s right to choose and on gun safety legislation. \u201cI am going to continue those fights into this campaign and I will do so every day that I\u2019m out there crisscrossing the state of Massachusetts and fighting for the people of our state.\u201d Kennedy and Markey are not far apart ideologically but the challenger sees a national Democratic party with more energetic leadership, standing up to Republicans who have chosen to back Donald Trump. \u201cThis about leadership,\u201d a Democratic operative familiar with Kennedy\u2019s thinking told the Guardian on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s why he was asked to offer the party\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s state of the union address [in 2018], and should be seen in the context of the post-2016 election [era].\u201d The challenge for Kennedy will be to articulate a compelling reason, other than his bloodline, for seeking to knock Markey out. The congressman planned a seven-stop tour of Massachusetts on Saturday, meeting figures from Democratic state leadership. On Friday, Salem mayor Kim Driscoll co-authored an op-ed in CommonWealth magazine in which she explained her endorsement of the congressman. \u201cAs mayors, our highest priority when it comes to partners in Congress is a leader who shows up. And Joe shows up for Massachusetts,\u201d she wrote. His challenge will also invite criticism that he is embarking on an expensive and divisive fight at a time when the party should be united in seeking to unseat Trump and secure a majority in the Senate. Markey\u2019s supporters include his fellow Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who told reporters last month he had been \u201ca great partner in the Senate\u201d. But the presidential hopeful also acknowledged Kennedy, noting he had once been her student. \u201cI worked with Joe before either one of us was in politics and have worked with him ever since he\u2019s been in Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s really an amazing person.\u201d Markey has the support of the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who dominates the progressive wing of the party. He has also lined up more than 100 state legislators, many of whom point to his leadership on climate change. \u201cWe are lucky to have one of the nation\u2019s strongest climate champions, Ed Markey, representing Massachusetts in the US Senate,\u201d Environment Massachusetts state director Ben Hellerstein said on Friday, saying the group would put $5m forward to support his reelection campaign. \u201cVoters need to know what Ed Markey has done throughout decades of public service to advance renewable energy, clean water, clean air, and the protection of our public lands. We intend to tell his story.\u201d The Kennedy family has never lost a statewide election. In his announcement on Saturday, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely meaningful to me to be able to do this here, where in 1848 a few steps from where this building is today, my father\u2019s family first arrived here in this country.\u201d Some Massachusetts Democrats have been unwilling to be drawn on their choice. Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, a member of \u201cthe Squad\u201d, has said she looks forward to working with Markey on environmental and gun control issues and with Kennedy on mental health. \u201cI think primaries are healthy,\u201d she said. Kennedy said: \u201cThe race is going to be decided by the people of Massachusetts.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Zandra Rhodes was born in 1940 in Chatham, Kent, where her mother taught at the local art college and her father drove a taxi. After studying printed textile design at the Royal College of Art, she opened her first fashion shop in <a href=\"https://agnautacouture.com/2015/12/06/dame-zandra-rhodes-a-lifelong-love-affair-with-textiles/\" title=\"\">London\u2019s Fulham Road in 1967</a>.

      "bodyText": "A rout initiated by David Silva after 52 seconds showed one way Manchester City can negotiate having Aymeric Laporte and John Stones missing because of injury: simply make it 5-0 inside 18 minutes and so nullify any concerns regarding being weakened in central defence. Pep Guardiola\u2019s side will, of course, have tougher challenges than bottom-placed Watford, who are yet to win this season. But most teams will struggle to contain the champions of the past two campaigns when they are in this imperious mood, and City ended with a record league victory under the manager. After Silva\u2019s opener, Sergio Ag\u00fcero (who has now scored in the opening six league games), Riyad Mahrez, Bernardo Silva and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi all placed their name on the scoresheet in a start to the first half that will be recalled for a while. After the break Bernardo Silva scored twice more to make it 7-0 and Kevin De Bruyne hit a rocket past Ben Foster near the end, to make it a 35-3 aggregate to City in their past eight meetings with Watford. Ever the perfectionist, Guardiola described the five-goal burst as \u201cweird\u201d, given that Gerard Deulofeu had skated past a hapless Otamendi and might have equalised after David Silva\u2019s opener. \u201cIt is weird, it is not normal,\u201d he said. \u201cFive shots, five goals.

Mahrez and De Bruyne were the other two, coming in for Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Raheem Sterling.

They added that the decision last week by lenders including Royal Bank of Scotland to pull out of a proposed Thomas Cook rescue deal was \u201cvery last minute\u201d and placed the firm in an extremely fragile position. \u201cIt has left them scrabbling around to find that money and it\u2019s not easy to find,\u201d added the source. If the company does collapse an emergency cabinet meeting would be called immediately to put the massive repatriation plan, codenamed Operation Matterhorn, into action. However, the travel expert Simon Calder urged holidaymakers already abroad on Thomas Cook holidays not to panic. Those with Atol-protected package holidays should be able to continue as normal with hotel bills paid and new flights provided by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in the event of the company going into administration. \u201cAll you need to do is to wait to be told when your replacement flight will be departing,\u201d he said. Yet frantic queries to Thomas Cook were being made by customers, some of whom have spent tens of thousands of pounds on holidays and weddings, about whether booked trips would go ahead and concerns that those overseas could be stranded. The CAA would not comment on the financial situation of individual businesses. Thomas Cook, one of the world\u2019s largest travel companies, was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and has annual sales of \u00a39bn. The company has had an eventful history, including being nationalised in 1948 and owning the boisterous Club 18-30 brand, which it recently closed after failing to find a buyer.",

Activists were reported to have glued themselves to streets and were told they could face arrest if they left a designated area.

      "body": "<p>The <em>London Review of Books</em> is <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/anniversary\" title=\"\">40 this month</a>. The paper, which has always considered itself something of a red rag, celebrates its ruby anniversary with a handsome anthology of articles, letters and manuscripts from 1979 to the present day: Julian Assange, Alan Bennett, Iraq, a cartoon by Kurt Vonnegut. Described as a scrapbook, this \u201cincomplete history\u201d looks sumptuous. It also looks secure. Who would have thought it in 1979? Not I. Who, for the first 13 years, was there.</p> <p>First published as a supplement in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, the paper was from the beginning clear about its general direction. The founding editor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/25/karl-miller\" title=\"\">Karl Miller</a>, had worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/09/london-review-books-lrb-best-magazines-world-mary-kay-wilmers\" title=\"\">Mary-Kay Wilmers</a> (who has been editor for the past 27 years), the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/26/peter-campbell-obituary\" title=\"\">designer Peter Campbell</a> and myself on the BBC\u2019s the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/31/bbc-online-archive-the-listener-magazine\" title=\"\">Listener</a></em> at the beginning of the decade. 1979 was the year Margaret Thatcher came to power: we weren\u2019t keen on her. It was also the year in which, due to a lock-out at Times Newspapers, the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> was not published. We shaped our publication partly in response to the <em>TLS</em>\u2019s position as a paper of record. We could be selective in our coverage and take up positions (though not attitudes). \u201cI do not believe in \u2018unprejudiced\u2019 reviewing,\u201d Miller wrote. \u201cBut I do believe in accurate reviewing.\u201d</p> <p>Much in those early numbers still looks fresh. But the apparatus and surroundings that produced them seem antique. Typewriters. Letters covered in blotches of Tipp-Ex, for which the office name was \u201ceczema\u201d. No screens; hand-drawn maps for layout; tins of <a href=\"https://www.forgottenartsupplies.com/?what=artifacts&amp;image_id=272\" title=\"\">Cow Gum</a>. I put in a comic appearance in the new book mightily cursing while wrestling overmatter onto the photocopier. Smoking \u2013 of cigars and cigarettes \u2013 long after it was considered advisable. Clive James, noticing one of us puffing away when he dropped off a review, said: \u201cIt\u2019s like seeing someone doing the twist.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Karl rang up Seamus Heaney to point out a mistake in a stanza: \u2018Scottish sheep don\u2019t chatter \u2013 they blether\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first office \u2013 off the packing department of Dillons bookshop, across the road from University College, where Miller was a professor \u2013 was tiny: I sent a week\u2019s worth of invoices into the wastepaper bin by moving too quickly to one of the (two) phones. Rooms subsequently acquired in Bedford Square, with furniture from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/dec/29/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Ian Hamilton</a>\u2019s recently folded <em>New Review</em>, were lofty but ramshackle. A note from the publisher, Nicholas Spice, to the landlord pleads: \u201cIt is raining here, inside and out\u201d. A huge dry rot mushroom, big enough to serve as a chair, grew in the room where the paper was pasted up. After a burglar bashed a hole in our front door, we kept the petty cash in the bookshelves behind a volume of Ezra Pound.</p> <p>Later, in Tavistock Square, the editorial staff shared one room, with the desks (green leather tops and blotters) arranged around three sides of a square. Required to sit, surrounded, on the fourth side, job interviewees must have felt as if they were being quizzed in a bear pit. An extra challenge was provided by the tip-up backless wooden chairs, bought from a second-hand shop in Gray\u2019s Inn Road, on which a candidate had to wobble. The best survived. Chaps who came for interview ready to spend days opening Jiffy bags and running to the printers have turned into writers of essays and of books after whom printers run. The elfin-locked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/john-lanchester\" title=\"\">John Lanchester</a> clinched a job by saying that he wanted to write about his school-fellow <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v13/n13/john-lanchester/strangers\" title=\"\">Jeremy Bamber</a>, who had recently been convicted of murdering his family. Andrew O\u2019Hagan, in his early 20s and a borrowed green suit, had swaths of the paper\u2019s content by heart.</p> <p>These writers have lately helped to establish the reputation of the <em>LRB</em> as a home for reportage. There was non-reviewing work to be proud of in those early years too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/18/tony-harrisons-poem-v-working-class\" title=\"\">Tony Harrison\u2019s forceful long poem </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/18/tony-harrisons-poem-v-working-class\" title=\"\">V</a></em> (\u201cThe rabble has taken over,\u201d said a Tory MP when Richard Eyre directed a televised reading); Ahdaf Soueif\u2019s vivid short stories about hovering between English and Cairene life; <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v07/n12/blake-morrison/the-ballad-of-the-yorkshire-ripper\" title=\"\">Blake Morrison\u2019s verse tale about the Yorkshire Ripper</a>; Ian Hamilton\u2019s account of the Comedy Store.

Tony Blair, invited to discuss \u201cthe state and future direction of the Labour party\u201d, dropped off a judicious piece in Tavistock Square in 1987. At Dillons, Angela Carter, an impresario of the baroque excuse for late copy \u2013 \u201cI went deaf and I trod on a rabid squirrel\u201d \u2013 turned up muffled in an enormous coat to discuss writing about Bertolucci\u2019s <em>La Luna</em>. In Bedford Square, Ted Hughes arrived in oilskins; AJP Taylor, appearing in a deerstalker, was mistaken for a motorcycle messenger; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jun/15/londonreviewofbooks\" title=\"\">William Empson</a>, whose glorious essay on <em>A</em> <em>Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream</em> was printed in the first issue, arrived sans teeth, with his specs bound with coloured tape. He sat in a swivelling chair (the only other unoccupied seat was broken) and explained he used to think he wrote slowly because he wrote when drunk, but now found that being sober made no difference. \u201cYou mean,\u201d said Karl, \u201cyou wrote <em><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/27537823?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\" title=\"\">The Structure of Complex Words</a></em> IN YOUR CUPS?\u201d</p> <p>In these offices, I learned to think that there was no necessary chasm between the \u201ccreative\u201d and the critical. Book reviews could spin a phrase without, God forbid, turning into a sonnet. Poets were expected to be precise. Karl rang up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/30/seamus-heaney\" title=\"\">Seamus Heaney</a> to point out a mistake in a stanza: \u201cScottish sheep don\u2019t chatter \u2013 they blether.\u201d Then, as now, the <em>London Review</em> was said to be edited as attentively as if it were a book. There was no absolute distinction between editing and copy editing: Mary-Kay Wilmers\u2019s exemplary bringing into focus of Oliver Sacks\u2019s imaginative effusions showed this perfectly. The editorial staff did not aim at show-off interventionism, nor did we spend a lot of time standing around being deep. Semi-colons (abhorred) were as often a subject for dispute as the matter they separated or linked. In the silence of proof-reading, a question would float out: \u201cNeo-platonism?\u201d Long pause. A wait for the ideal form. Then the response. \u201cHyphenated.\u201d</p> <p>Still, questions about impartiality and unfairness came up time and again. Isaiah Berlin complained at discussions of Israel and the Palestinians by the \u201cfanatical\u201d Ian Gilmour. When Al Alvarez\u2019s book about divorce was <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v04/n10/ursula-creagh/first-chapters\" title=\"\">reviewed</a> by Ursula Creagh, his first wife, Frank Kermode sent a letter to his fellow board members protesting that this was an \u201cinexcusable lapse\u201d for \u201ca journal which relies for its reputation on unprejudiced comment\u201d. Miller made a stirring case for publication: \u201cIf it is all right for Al to publish a book belittling his first wife, then it cannot be all wrong and virtually inexcusable to publish an intelligent discussion of the book by that first wife.\u201d</p> <p>The covers, pictorial at a time when literary journals were mostly typographical, were definitely partial, as all covers are: they stuck up for favourites and suggested an agenda. Photographs by Christopher Killip provided a dark summary of the landscape of Thatcher\u2019s England; David King supplied a picture of the young Alan Hollinghurst and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/09/francis-wyndham-obituary\" title=\"\">Francis Wyndham</a>, looking, as a friend said, \u201clike two cardinals\u201d. You can trace a generation of writers through these pictures. Ian McEwan, snapped by Peter Campbell in a snowy Bedford Square (\u201cAm I clever enough?\u201d he wrote in response to my request for a piece). Martin Amis looking sultry (I took a breathless call from a woman asking that I urgently send her a copy). Angela Carter, Ahdaf Soueif. Julian Barnes was the only writer to make the cover twice: once as Barnes, novelist; once, disguised with a moustache, as Dan Kavanagh, his <em>nom de plume</em> as a writer of thrillers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22847288b097fe80264216f08ad1ba5c92969971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22847288b097fe80264216f08ad1ba5c92969971/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LRB editor Mary-Kay Wilmers in the journal\u2019s office in Bloomsbury, London, March 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LRB editor Mary-Kay Wilmers in the journal\u2019s office in Bloomsbury, London, March 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anita Brookner also made the cover, wittily pictured with her immaculate hair in the shape of the tulips beside her.

      "bodyText": "The London Review of Books is 40 this month. The paper, which has always considered itself something of a red rag, celebrates its ruby anniversary with a handsome anthology of articles, letters and manuscripts from 1979 to the present day: Julian Assange, Alan Bennett, Iraq, a cartoon by Kurt Vonnegut. Described as a scrapbook, this \u201cincomplete history\u201d looks sumptuous. It also looks secure. Who would have thought it in 1979? Not I. Who, for the first 13 years, was there. First published as a supplement in the New York Review of Books, the paper was from the beginning clear about its general direction. The founding editor, Karl Miller, had worked with Mary-Kay Wilmers (who has been editor for the past 27 years), the designer Peter Campbell and myself on the BBC\u2019s the Listener at the beginning of the decade. 1979 was the year Margaret Thatcher came to power: we weren\u2019t keen on her. It was also the year in which, due to a lock-out at Times Newspapers, the Times Literary Supplement was not published. We shaped our publication partly in response to the TLS\u2019s position as a paper of record. We could be selective in our coverage and take up positions (though not attitudes). \u201cI do not believe in \u2018unprejudiced\u2019 reviewing,\u201d Miller wrote. \u201cBut I do believe in accurate reviewing.\u201d Much in those early numbers still looks fresh. But the apparatus and surroundings that produced them seem antique. Typewriters. Letters covered in blotches of Tipp-Ex, for which the office name was \u201ceczema\u201d. No screens; hand-drawn maps for layout; tins of Cow Gum. I put in a comic appearance in the new book mightily cursing while wrestling overmatter onto the photocopier. Smoking \u2013 of cigars and cigarettes \u2013 long after it was considered advisable. Clive James, noticing one of us puffing away when he dropped off a review, said: \u201cIt\u2019s like seeing someone doing the twist.\u201d The first office \u2013 off the packing department of Dillons bookshop, across the road from University College, where Miller was a professor \u2013 was tiny: I sent a week\u2019s worth of invoices into the wastepaper bin by moving too quickly to one of the (two) phones. Rooms subsequently acquired in Bedford Square, with furniture from Ian Hamilton\u2019s recently folded New Review, were lofty but ramshackle. A note from the publisher, Nicholas Spice, to the landlord pleads: \u201cIt is raining here, inside and out\u201d. A huge dry rot mushroom, big enough to serve as a chair, grew in the room where the paper was pasted up. After a burglar bashed a hole in our front door, we kept the petty cash in the bookshelves behind a volume of Ezra Pound. Later, in Tavistock Square, the editorial staff shared one room, with the desks (green leather tops and blotters) arranged around three sides of a square. Required to sit, surrounded, on the fourth side, job interviewees must have felt as if they were being quizzed in a bear pit. An extra challenge was provided by the tip-up backless wooden chairs, bought from a second-hand shop in Gray\u2019s Inn Road, on which a candidate had to wobble. The best survived. Chaps who came for interview ready to spend days opening Jiffy bags and running to the printers have turned into writers of essays and of books after whom printers run. The elfin-locked John Lanchester clinched a job by saying that he wanted to write about his school-fellow Jeremy Bamber, who had recently been convicted of murdering his family. Andrew O\u2019Hagan, in his early 20s and a borrowed green suit, had swaths of the paper\u2019s content by heart. These writers have lately helped to establish the reputation of the LRB as a home for reportage. There was non-reviewing work to be proud of in those early years too. Tony Harrison\u2019s forceful long poem V (\u201cThe rabble has taken over,\u201d said a Tory MP when Richard Eyre directed a televised reading); Ahdaf Soueif\u2019s vivid short stories about hovering between English and Cairene life; Blake Morrison\u2019s verse tale about the Yorkshire Ripper; Ian Hamilton\u2019s account of the Comedy Store. And a short story by Salman Rushdie \u2013 the first time he had actually been asked to write something. Midnight\u2019s Children had just escaped being turned down at Jonathan Cape: when we published a long praising review, Rushdie came in to read it \u2013 and had to sit down, astonished. In the days before email, contributors, when not fibbing about pieces being in the post, often came in to deliver articles. Tony Blair, invited to discuss \u201cthe state and future direction of the Labour party\u201d, dropped off a judicious piece in Tavistock Square in 1987. At Dillons, Angela Carter, an impresario of the baroque excuse for late copy \u2013 \u201cI went deaf and I trod on a rabid squirrel\u201d \u2013 turned up muffled in an enormous coat to discuss writing about Bertolucci\u2019s La Luna. In Bedford Square, Ted Hughes arrived in oilskins; AJP Taylor, appearing in a deerstalker, was mistaken for a motorcycle messenger; and William Empson, whose glorious essay on A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream was printed in the first issue, arrived sans teeth, with his specs bound with coloured tape. He sat in a swivelling chair (the only other unoccupied seat was broken) and explained he used to think he wrote slowly because he wrote when drunk, but now found that being sober made no difference. \u201cYou mean,\u201d said Karl, \u201cyou wrote The Structure of Complex Words IN YOUR CUPS?\u201d In these offices, I learned to think that there was no necessary chasm between the \u201ccreative\u201d and the critical. Book reviews could spin a phrase without, God forbid, turning into a sonnet. Poets were expected to be precise. Karl rang up Seamus Heaney to point out a mistake in a stanza: \u201cScottish sheep don\u2019t chatter \u2013 they blether.\u201d Then, as now, the London Review was said to be edited as attentively as if it were a book. There was no absolute distinction between editing and copy editing: Mary-Kay Wilmers\u2019s exemplary bringing into focus of Oliver Sacks\u2019s imaginative effusions showed this perfectly. The editorial staff did not aim at show-off interventionism, nor did we spend a lot of time standing around being deep. Semi-colons (abhorred) were as often a subject for dispute as the matter they separated or linked. In the silence of proof-reading, a question would float out: \u201cNeo-platonism?\u201d Long pause. A wait for the ideal form. Then the response. \u201cHyphenated.\u201d Still, questions about impartiality and unfairness came up time and again. Isaiah Berlin complained at discussions of Israel and the Palestinians by the \u201cfanatical\u201d Ian Gilmour. When Al Alvarez\u2019s book about divorce was reviewed by Ursula Creagh, his first wife, Frank Kermode sent a letter to his fellow board members protesting that this was an \u201cinexcusable lapse\u201d for \u201ca journal which relies for its reputation on unprejudiced comment\u201d. Miller made a stirring case for publication: \u201cIf it is all right for Al to publish a book belittling his first wife, then it cannot be all wrong and virtually inexcusable to publish an intelligent discussion of the book by that first wife.\u201d The covers, pictorial at a time when literary journals were mostly typographical, were definitely partial, as all covers are: they stuck up for favourites and suggested an agenda. Photographs by Christopher Killip provided a dark summary of the landscape of Thatcher\u2019s England; David King supplied a picture of the young Alan Hollinghurst and Francis Wyndham, looking, as a friend said, \u201clike two cardinals\u201d. You can trace a generation of writers through these pictures. Ian McEwan, snapped by Peter Campbell in a snowy Bedford Square (\u201cAm I clever enough?\u201d he wrote in response to my request for a piece). Martin Amis looking sultry (I took a breathless call from a woman asking that I urgently send her a copy). Angela Carter, Ahdaf Soueif. Julian Barnes was the only writer to make the cover twice: once as Barnes, novelist; once, disguised with a moustache, as Dan Kavanagh, his nom de plume as a writer of thrillers. Anita Brookner also made the cover, wittily pictured with her immaculate hair in the shape of the tulips beside her. It was Brookner who, in 1982, when we were looking for someone to write against the not-much-criticised Falklands war, suggested Tam Dalyell \u2013 \u201cTAMDALYELLMPFORWEST LOTHIAN\u201d as he used boomingly to announce himself on the phone. He did us proud, with his forthright articles, handwritten on House of Commons notepaper. Other politicians turned us down because the fee was insufficient, but hardly anyone else did so. The endeavour was serious: prosecuted with jokes and shouting and concentration. No one was in it for the money: indeed, in the manner of leftwing papers, money was barely mentioned. I am speaking only about the time I was on the paper: I left in 1992. I imagine that with a larger staff \u2013 eight editors compared with the original three \u2013 and more efficient technology, some procedures are smoother and some rudimentary blunders are avoided. Such as my postal error with the venerable scholar Elsie Duncan-Jones, grandmother of the now regular contributor Bee Wilson. Having dispatched a proof to her, I realised too late that I had put it in an envelope holding something to which I\u2019d been looking forward at the end of the day: a Valium. In 1979, Ian Hamilton issued a trenchant warning of the difficulties for any new paper: \u201cThe appalling thing about our literary culture at the moment is that a large section of its representatives seem to get more of a kick out of seeing things collapse than they do out of seeing them survive.\u201d In an introductory essay to the anniversary book, Mary-Kay Wilmers suggests that things have changed: that the world is now \u201cmuch more friendly to us\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The <em>grands projets </em>of <strong><a href=\"http://www.antonygormley.com/\">Antony Gormley</a> </strong>(b1950) have arrived at the Royal Academy, preceded by a very small one in the courtyard. This takes the form of a newborn baby cast in solid black iron. It lies on the ground, curled up in innocent sleep, yet shiny and hard as a bomb. Forget tenderness: the immediate response is shock, with the uneasy afterthought that you might almost have tripped over this infant doorstop.</p> <p><em>Iron Baby</em> is a tough conceit, setting off thoughts of landmines and human vulnerability, but also latent strength. Like a real baby, it is nut-full of ideas. You might pause before this sculpture, from 1999, and to my knowledge never repeated. It is by far the best work in <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/antony-gormley?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9vWCo6Xa5AIVCkTTCh1prA6EEAAYASAAEgJEZPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" title=\"\">this show</a>.</p> <p>Expansive, expensive, monumental, prolific: Gormley\u2019s art spreads across the globe. His famous body forms, based on his own athletically tall person, are stationed like dumb watchmen everywhere, emerging from sand, sea and pavement, contemplating the view, dominating the landscape. Reproduction has always been his modus operandi. But in this survey, stretching back 40 years or so, it turns instead to repetition. So much of what you see here amounts to reprise or the regurgitation of past ideas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"904f11e90f25d13768e15b8de73f83a060cc414f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/904f11e90f25d13768e15b8de73f83a060cc414f/0_0_3600_2681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iron Baby, 1999, by Antony Gormley, in the courtyard of the Royal Academy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"745\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iron Baby, 1999, by Antony Gormley, in the courtyard of the Royal Academy: \u2018by far the best work in this show\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/ Rex/ Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take a big work such as <em>Clearing VII</em>, from 2019 (the formative <em>Clearing I</em> was shown at London\u2019s White Cube in 2004). Eight kilometres of black aluminium tubing sweeps in coils and loops round an entire gallery, contained only by the floor, walls and ceiling. It looks exactly as you might expect \u2013 like a huge, dark 3D scribble. You are supposed to clamber around and through it, somehow without tripping \u2013 and in so doing you will \u201ccomplete\u201d the work, becoming not just a figure caught like a burr in a briar, but even the subject of the art \u2013 a notion coined by Marcel Duchamp over a century ago.</p> <p>For <em>Cave</em>, also 2019, a colossal amount of metal has been beaten into linked shafts, vents and corridors through which we are to hunch and blunder, moving between glowering darkness and occasional light. This is a pretty familiar art trope: think of the dark mazes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/24/mike-nelson-the-asset-strippers-review-tate-britain-duveen\" title=\"\">Mike Nelson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/james-turrell\" title=\"\">James Turrell</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/jan/02/art\" title=\"\">Gregor Schneider</a>. But here there is no sensual or intellectual revelation. You\u2019re in and then you\u2019re out, like a ghost train without any ghosts. Or you can simply walk round it.</p> <p>There is a certain literalism to some of the early works. <em>Full Bowl</em> (1977-8) is a bowl full of bowls. <em>Grasp</em> (1982) is a lump of clay inscribed with a depiction of the hands that shaped it. And there is a certain obviousness to the later works too. A colossal form, somewhere between conker and wrecking ball, dangles almost to the ground. Another, nearby, looks more like a human organ. But their shape and affinity feels random; size is all, gigantism their sole distinguishing force.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fd37420a75da2707932a148530b7a7e637434c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fd37420a75da2707932a148530b7a7e637434c5/0_0_3883_5825/667.jpg\" alt=\"Host, 2016,  by Antony Gormley at the Royal Academy.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The obvious crowd-pleaser\u2019: Host, 2016, by Antony Gormley at the Royal Academy. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a large gallery of rusting Gorms, jutting at right angles from the walls, hanging from the ceiling, or arranged in a ring, facing outwards. They make no contact, occasion no feelings, stymie all our anthropomorphic instincts. Instead, these interchangeable non-beings are intended to disorient (<em>Lost </em><em>Horizon</em> is their collective title), to make us think about bodies in space. Like all the other humanoids in this show \u2013 Gorms made of rods, slabs or pixelated blocks, as if computer-generated \u2013 it is easier to admire the engineering than the actual forms.</p> <p>The shortfall between the art and Gormley\u2019s exalted ambitions for it is typically stark. In the exhibition guide, he says he wants to heighten \u201cour sense of position in time and space\u201d with the unappealingly titled <em>Co-Ordinate VI</em>. This consists of a metal bar running through three galleries, just above head height. It measures the rooms like a surveyor\u2019s laser, except without the exciting red glow. One gallery contains nothing but this bar. Never has a room of the Royal Academy felt so empty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of Cattelan\u2019s own pint-size self-portraits, hanging among Blenheim\u2019s gold-framed ones, is practically winking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gormley\u2019s drawings express his preoccupations with greater visual strength: a man in a dark doorway, another rushing through a tunnel, or trapped inside his own body. They are worked in earth, crude oil or rabbit-skin glue, connecting humanity with nature. Just as recent clay sculptures speak of people and objects discovered in archaeological digs: elements piled on the gallery floor that resemble newly baked loaves as well as the bones of hunched figures, shielding themselves from the blast, like the citizens of Pompeii.</p> <p>The obvious crowd-pleaser at the Royal Academy is <em>Host</em> (2016), a low tide of brine lying over red earth that darkens with dusk. A great liquid expanse, contained in a single gallery, reflecting the skylights above?

      "bodyText": "The grands projets of Antony Gormley (b1950) have arrived at the Royal Academy, preceded by a very small one in the courtyard. This takes the form of a newborn baby cast in solid black iron. It lies on the ground, curled up in innocent sleep, yet shiny and hard as a bomb. Forget tenderness: the immediate response is shock, with the uneasy afterthought that you might almost have tripped over this infant doorstop. Iron Baby is a tough conceit, setting off thoughts of landmines and human vulnerability, but also latent strength. Like a real baby, it is nut-full of ideas. You might pause before this sculpture, from 1999, and to my knowledge never repeated. It is by far the best work in this show. Expansive, expensive, monumental, prolific: Gormley\u2019s art spreads across the globe. His famous body forms, based on his own athletically tall person, are stationed like dumb watchmen everywhere, emerging from sand, sea and pavement, contemplating the view, dominating the landscape. Reproduction has always been his modus operandi. But in this survey, stretching back 40 years or so, it turns instead to repetition. So much of what you see here amounts to reprise or the regurgitation of past ideas. Take a big work such as Clearing VII, from 2019 (the formative Clearing I was shown at London\u2019s White Cube in 2004). Eight kilometres of black aluminium tubing sweeps in coils and loops round an entire gallery, contained only by the floor, walls and ceiling. It looks exactly as you might expect \u2013 like a huge, dark 3D scribble. You are supposed to clamber around and through it, somehow without tripping \u2013 and in so doing you will \u201ccomplete\u201d the work, becoming not just a figure caught like a burr in a briar, but even the subject of the art \u2013 a notion coined by Marcel Duchamp over a century ago. For Cave, also 2019, a colossal amount of metal has been beaten into linked shafts, vents and corridors through which we are to hunch and blunder, moving between glowering darkness and occasional light. This is a pretty familiar art trope: think of the dark mazes of Mike Nelson, James Turrell or Gregor Schneider. But here there is no sensual or intellectual revelation. You\u2019re in and then you\u2019re out, like a ghost train without any ghosts. Or you can simply walk round it. There is a certain literalism to some of the early works. Full Bowl (1977-8) is a bowl full of bowls. Grasp (1982) is a lump of clay inscribed with a depiction of the hands that shaped it. And there is a certain obviousness to the later works too. A colossal form, somewhere between conker and wrecking ball, dangles almost to the ground. Another, nearby, looks more like a human organ. But their shape and affinity feels random; size is all, gigantism their sole distinguishing force. There is a large gallery of rusting Gorms, jutting at right angles from the walls, hanging from the ceiling, or arranged in a ring, facing outwards. They make no contact, occasion no feelings, stymie all our anthropomorphic instincts. Instead, these interchangeable non-beings are intended to disorient (Lost Horizon is their collective title), to make us think about bodies in space. Like all the other humanoids in this show \u2013 Gorms made of rods, slabs or pixelated blocks, as if computer-generated \u2013 it is easier to admire the engineering than the actual forms. The shortfall between the art and Gormley\u2019s exalted ambitions for it is typically stark. In the exhibition guide, he says he wants to heighten \u201cour sense of position in time and space\u201d with the unappealingly titled Co-Ordinate VI. This consists of a metal bar running through three galleries, just above head height. It measures the rooms like a surveyor\u2019s laser, except without the exciting red glow. One gallery contains nothing but this bar. Never has a room of the Royal Academy felt so empty. Gormley\u2019s drawings express his preoccupations with greater visual strength: a man in a dark doorway, another rushing through a tunnel, or trapped inside his own body. They are worked in earth, crude oil or rabbit-skin glue, connecting humanity with nature. Just as recent clay sculptures speak of people and objects discovered in archaeological digs: elements piled on the gallery floor that resemble newly baked loaves as well as the bones of hunched figures, shielding themselves from the blast, like the citizens of Pompeii. The obvious crowd-pleaser at the Royal Academy is Host (2016), a low tide of brine lying over red earth that darkens with dusk. A great liquid expanse, contained in a single gallery, reflecting the skylights above? It reminds me of nothing so much as Richard Wilson\u2019s 20:50 (1987), a sea of oil through which you walk, miraculously untarnished, watching the room doubled and halved in its shining surface; a work that really makes you think about bodies in space. Maurizio Cattelan\u2019s golden lavatory was a flash in the pan, stolen from Blenheim Palace last weekend after only one day. So there is no way of knowing how much America, as the object was sardonically titled, sharpened the satire of the Italian artist\u2019s solo show in Churchill\u2019s birthplace. For although billed as an intervention, this is more or less Catellan\u2019s greatest hits: from lifesize waxworks of Pope John Paul II struck down by a meteorite to a praying schoolboy Hitler, as well as the tragicomic taxidermies for which he is known, specifically the poor horse with its elongated legs that has dangled from many a museum ceiling.

Today, most milk consumed in the UK is pasteurised, homogenised as well as standardised \u2013 which is to say, processed to assure a consistent percentage of fat.</p> <p>There are hotly contested theories professing the merits of raw, unpasteurised, unhomogenised milk. Pasteurisation heats milk to destroy potential pathogens but, say raw milk advocates, decreases vitamins which could be beneficial to health. Some believe that the homogenisation process \u2013 emulsifying the milk under high pressure to distribute fat molecules evenly so the cream does not rise to the top \u2013 promotes the absorption of xanthine oxidase into the bloodstream, which in turn could be detrimental to heart health.</p> <p>However, there are also plenty of doubters as scientific research on its health benefits appears inconclusive. Some take their objections further, believing raw milk to be detrimental to health. In the USA there were 144 outbreaks of illness reportedly linked to raw milk between 2007 and 2016 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/rawmilk/index.html\">according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The UK\u2019s Food Standards Agency <a href=\"https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/media/document/Raw%20Drinking%20Milk%20-%20FSA%2018-06-07.pdf\">said last year</a> that since 2015 there had been an increased risk from raw drinking milk, which reflected \u201cgreater levels of exposure due to increases in the number of registered producers and volume of production and consumption, alongside an increase in the number of outbreaks of human illness associated with RDM.\u201d However, the FSA also said it had found little direct evidence that unpasteurised products made using raw milk - milkshakes, smoothies and ice cream - have caused illness.</p> <p>The FSA <a href=\"https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/raw-drinking-milk\">advises </a>pregnant women, infants and small children, elderly people and people with a compromised immune system such as cancer patients not to drink raw milk.</p> <p>Farms such as Mossgiel are opting to raise their cows organically, and not to homogenise their milk. For Cunningham, it\u2019s this approach that brought his family farm out of crippling debt.</p> <p>Geoff Bowles, who runs <a href=\"https://www.ivyhousefarmdairy.co.uk/about-us\" title=\"\">Ivy House farm</a> in Somerset, which provides Harrods, Fortnum &amp; Mason and Selfridges with their unhomogenised, organic milk, cites the high price of the equipment needed as one of the reasons he has never homogenised his milk but, aside from the purported health benefits, he also highlights its practical value.</p> <p>\u201cIt will mask the early stages of souring,\u201d he says. \u201cWhereas with non-homogenised milk, the fat coagulates and floats to the top \u2013 that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s on its way out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a869b7572dfcc5364238a6584bfaf8ea3c20b733\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a869b7572dfcc5364238a6584bfaf8ea3c20b733/0_310_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Creamy moustache\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creamy moustaches were banished by homogenisation, which gives milk a longer shelf life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CHBD/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even supermarkets such as Waitrose have seen a rise in demand \u2013 in the past year it reported a 28% increase in searches for non-homogenised milk on its site and a 3% increase in sales of its Duchy Organic cow\u2019s milk range, none of which is homogenised.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/raw-drinking-milk\" title=\"\">Raw milk</a> \u2013 which comes straight from the cow: unpasteurised, non-homogenised and unaltered from udder to bottle \u2013 also continues to rise in popularity. Searches for raw milk on the Waitrose site have increased by 54% in the past year alone. The Raw Milk Producers Association reports that production in England, Wales and Northern Ireland has gone up by 600% since 2014. It is still illegal to sell raw milk in Scotland, but that doesn\u2019t stop it getting in \u2013 numerous raw milk dairies from other parts of the UK ship into Scotland.</p> <p>Environmentally friendly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/07/return-milkround-plastic-problem-glass-bottle-deliveries\" title=\"\">glass bottles</a> are making a comeback too. \u201cWe started using glass bottles in May,\u201d says Bowles. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve seen a steady increase in sales, and now 15% of our milk goes out in glass bottles. It\u2019s made a big difference.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not alone. <a href=\"https://www.grahamsfamilydairy.com/\" title=\"\">Graham\u2019s Family Dairy</a> in Stirlingshire, Scotland\u2019s largest independent dairy, has enjoyed a 25% increase in customer inquiries each week since it started using glass bottles in May this year.</p> <p>Mossgiel moved all its packaging over to glass and reusable plastic in January. Last November it produced 8,000 to 9,000 litres a week for 251 customers; today that has risen to more than 15,000 litres for 379 customers. Cunningham thinks the packaging is responsible for this increase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"498ea69f000987df2c31a10f9acb69a85134c27e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/498ea69f000987df2c31a10f9acb69a85134c27e/0_146_4352_2611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glass milk bottles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glass milk bottles are appearing on doorsteps once again.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Moore/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The environmental impact of plastic is likely impacting these figures, particular since awareness was raised by David Attenborough in his much-publicised criticism of its catastrophic effect on the world\u2019s oceans in Blue Planet II last year. Vending machines have emerged where customers can fill up their own containers with non-homogenised, organic milk \u2013 Mossgiel supplies four in Scotland. Ivy House delivers its milk to coffee shops in churns.</p> <p>With the re-emergence of independent milkmen, nostalgia may also be playing a part. The BBC reported that in the mid-1990s more than 2.5 billion litres of milk were delivered by milkmen each year. By 2004 that number had dropped to 637 million litres, and by 2016, barely 3% of milk consumed in the UK came by way of milkmen. In 2019, Cunningham supplies milk to six companies that home-deliver across Scotland. One such company, Milk &amp; More, which was purchased by M\u00fcller in 2015, is reporting a 46% growth in online sales year on year.</p> <p>Roger Kerr, chief executive of Organic Farmers and Growers and former managing director of the Calon Wen cooperative in Wales, thinks people are becoming more aware of their impact on the environment. \u201cI think some of these changes are happening because of the plastic thing. People are wanting to do something: \u2018What can I do, given I\u2019m not going to stop flying to Ibiza, or driving my car?\u2019The move to glass is part of that, as is the rise in doorstep delivery.\u201d</p> <p>In the age of Brexit and cultural uncertainty \u2013 like the nursery food that gained popularity during the 2008 recession \u2013 old-fashioned milk seems to have become part of Britain\u2019s nostalgia safety-net. Except this time, there\u2019s a positive result for the producers\u2019 efforts: financial, not to mention environmental, gain.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2019 to incorporate further details about the science and the FSA\u2019s risk assessment and advice.</p>",

The UK\u2019s Food Standards Agency said last year that since 2015 there had been an increased risk from raw drinking milk, which reflected \u201cgreater levels of exposure due to increases in the number of registered producers and volume of production and consumption, alongside an increase in the number of outbreaks of human illness associated with RDM.\u201d However, the FSA also said it had found little direct evidence that unpasteurised products made using raw milk - milkshakes, smoothies and ice cream - have caused illness. The FSA advises pregnant women, infants and small children, elderly people and people with a compromised immune system such as cancer patients not to drink raw milk. Farms such as Mossgiel are opting to raise their cows organically, and not to homogenise their milk. For Cunningham, it\u2019s this approach that brought his family farm out of crippling debt. Geoff Bowles, who runs Ivy House farm in Somerset, which provides Harrods, Fortnum &amp; Mason and Selfridges with their unhomogenised, organic milk, cites the high price of the equipment needed as one of the reasons he has never homogenised his milk but, aside from the purported health benefits, he also highlights its practical value. \u201cIt will mask the early stages of souring,\u201d he says. \u201cWhereas with non-homogenised milk, the fat coagulates and floats to the top \u2013 that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s on its way out.\u201d Even supermarkets such as Waitrose have seen a rise in demand \u2013 in the past year it reported a 28% increase in searches for non-homogenised milk on its site and a 3% increase in sales of its Duchy Organic cow\u2019s milk range, none of which is homogenised. Raw milk \u2013 which comes straight from the cow: unpasteurised, non-homogenised and unaltered from udder to bottle \u2013 also continues to rise in popularity. Searches for raw milk on the Waitrose site have increased by 54% in the past year alone. The Raw Milk Producers Association reports that production in England, Wales and Northern Ireland has gone up by 600% since 2014. It is still illegal to sell raw milk in Scotland, but that doesn\u2019t stop it getting in \u2013 numerous raw milk dairies from other parts of the UK ship into Scotland. Environmentally friendly glass bottles are making a comeback too. \u201cWe started using glass bottles in May,\u201d says Bowles. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve seen a steady increase in sales, and now 15% of our milk goes out in glass bottles. It\u2019s made a big difference.\u201d He\u2019s not alone. Graham\u2019s Family Dairy in Stirlingshire, Scotland\u2019s largest independent dairy, has enjoyed a 25% increase in customer inquiries each week since it started using glass bottles in May this year. Mossgiel moved all its packaging over to glass and reusable plastic in January. Last November it produced 8,000 to 9,000 litres a week for 251 customers; today that has risen to more than 15,000 litres for 379 customers. Cunningham thinks the packaging is responsible for this increase. The environmental impact of plastic is likely impacting these figures, particular since awareness was raised by David Attenborough in his much-publicised criticism of its catastrophic effect on the world\u2019s oceans in Blue Planet II last year. Vending machines have emerged where customers can fill up their own containers with non-homogenised, organic milk \u2013 Mossgiel supplies four in Scotland. Ivy House delivers its milk to coffee shops in churns. With the re-emergence of independent milkmen, nostalgia may also be playing a part. The BBC reported that in the mid-1990s more than 2.5 billion litres of milk were delivered by milkmen each year. By 2004 that number had dropped to 637 million litres, and by 2016, barely 3% of milk consumed in the UK came by way of milkmen. In 2019, Cunningham supplies milk to six companies that home-deliver across Scotland. One such company, Milk &amp; More, which was purchased by M\u00fcller in 2015, is reporting a 46% growth in online sales year on year. Roger Kerr, chief executive of Organic Farmers and Growers and former managing director of the Calon Wen cooperative in Wales, thinks people are becoming more aware of their impact on the environment. \u201cI think some of these changes are happening because of the plastic thing. People are wanting to do something: \u2018What can I do, given I\u2019m not going to stop flying to Ibiza, or driving my car?\u2019The move to glass is part of that, as is the rise in doorstep delivery.\u201d In the age of Brexit and cultural uncertainty \u2013 like the nursery food that gained popularity during the 2008 recession \u2013 old-fashioned milk seems to have become part of Britain\u2019s nostalgia safety-net. Except this time, there\u2019s a positive result for the producers\u2019 efforts: financial, not to mention environmental, gain. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2019 to incorporate further details about the science and the FSA\u2019s risk assessment and advice.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://vaclavsmil.com/\" title=\"\">Vaclav Smil</a> is a distinguished professor emeritus in the faculty of environment at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. Over more than 40 years, his books on the environment, population, food and energy have steadily grown in influence. He is now seen as one of the world\u2019s foremost thinkers on development history and a master of statistical analysis. <a href=\"https://www.thegatesnotes.com/Books/Energy/Harvesting-The-Biosphere\" title=\"\">Bill Gates says</a> he waits for new Smil books the way some people wait for the next <em>Star Wars</em> movie.

There is perhaps no other academic who paints pictures with numbers like you. You dug up the astonishing statistic that China has </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/28/the-grey-wall-of-china-inside-the-worlds-concrete-superpower\" title=\"\"><strong>poured more cement every three years since 2003 than the US managed in the entire 20th century</strong></a><strong>. You calculated that</strong><strong> in 2000, the dry mass of all the humans in the world </strong><strong>was </strong><a href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Harvesting-The-Biosphere\" title=\"\"><strong>125m metric tonnes</strong></a><strong> compared </strong><strong>with just 10</strong><strong>m tonnes for all wild vertebrates</strong><strong>. And now you explore patterns of growth, from the healthy development of forests and brains to the unhealthy increase in obesity and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Before we get into those deeper issues, can I ask if you see yourself as a nerd? </strong><br>Not at all. I\u2019m just an old-fashioned scientist describing the world and the lay of the land as it is. That\u2019s all there is to it. It\u2019s not good enough just to say life is better or the trains are faster. You have to bring in the numbers. This book is an exercise in buttressing what I have to say with numbers so people see these are the facts and they are difficult to dispute.</p> <p><strong><em>Growth</em> is a huge book \u2013 almost 200,000 words that synthesise many of your other studies, ranging across the world and exploring far into the past and future. Do you see this as your magnum opus? </strong><br>I have deliberately set out to write the megabook on growth. In a way, it\u2019s unwieldy and unreasonable. People can take any number of books out of it \u2013 economists can read about the growth of GDP and population; biologists can read about the growth of organisms and human bodies. But I wanted to put it all together under one roof so people could see how these things are inevitably connected and how it all shares one crystal clarity: that growth must come to an end. Our economist friends don\u2019t seem to realise that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d4d585d3ec67fd50d79630141552bd9ff570e36f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4d585d3ec67fd50d79630141552bd9ff570e36f/0_0_4500_1925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze river in China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"428\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze river in China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laoma/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>I first came across your work while I was writing a book about the Chinese environment. Time and again, you had the data that I was looking for \u2013 and it often revealed how dubious many of the official statistics were. You have been described as a \u201cslayer of bullshit\u201d. Is that your goal? </strong><br>I was brought up in Czechoslovakia during the era of the Soviet bloc. Having spent 26 years of my life in the evil empire, I do not tolerate nonsense. I grew up surrounded by commie propaganda \u2013 the bright tomorrow, the great future of mankind \u2013 so I\u2019m as critical as they come. It\u2019s not my opinion. These are the facts. I don\u2019t write opinion pieces. I write things that are totally underlined by facts.</p> <p><strong>You debunk overly rosy projections by techno-optimists, who say we can solve all our problems with smarter computers, and economists, who promise endless capitalist growth</strong><strong>. In many countries, the downside of material growth now seems greater than the upside, which leads to what you call \u201canthropogenic insults to ecosystems\u201d. Is that a fair summary? </strong><br>Yes, I think so. Without a biosphere in a good shape, there is no life on the planet. It\u2019s very simple. That\u2019s all you need to know. The economists will tell you we can decouple growth from material consumption, but that is total nonsense. The options are quite clear from the historical evidence. If you don\u2019t manage decline, then you succumb to it and you are gone. The best hope is that you find some way to manage it. We are in a better position to do that now than we were 50 or 100 years ago, because our knowledge is much vaster. If we sit down, we can come up with something. It won\u2019t be painless, but we can come up with ways to minimise that pain.</p> <p><strong>So we need to change our expectations of GDP growth? </strong><br>Yes, the simple fact is that however you define happiness, we know \u2013 and we have known this for ages \u2013 that the amount of GDP is not going to improve your satisfaction with life, equanimity and sense of wellbeing. Look at Japan. They are pretty rich but they are among the unhappiest people on the planet. Then who is always in the top 10 of the happiest people? It is the Philippines, which is much poorer and smitten by typhoons, yet many times more happy than their neighbours in Japan. Once you reach a certain point, the benefits of GDP growth start to level off in terms of mortality, nutrition and education.</p> <p><strong>Is that point the golden mean? Is that what we should be aiming for rather than pushing until growth becomes malign, cancerous, obese and environmentally destructive? </strong><br>Exactly. That would be nice. We could halve our energy and material consumption and this would put us back around the level of the 1960s. We could cut down without losing anything important. Life wasn\u2019t horrible in 1960s or 70s Europe. People from Copenhagen would no longer be able to fly to Singapore for a three-day visit, but so what? Not much is going to happen to their lives. People don\u2019t realise how much slack in the system we have.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The growth of information is not just a flood or an explosion. Those adjectives are inadequate. We are buried under information. It\u2019s not doing anyone any good</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You cite </strong><strong>Kenneth Boulding</strong><strong>\u2019s distinction between the</strong><strong> \u201ccowboy economy\u201d and the \u201cspaceman economy\u201d.</strong><strong> The former is wide-open spaces and seemingly endless opportunities for resource consumption. The latter is a recognition that planet Earth is more like a closed spaceship on which we need to carefully manage our resources. The challenge is to shift from one way of thinking to another. But human history is thousands of years of cowboys and only a few decades of spacemen. Aren\u2019t we hardwired? </strong><br>There is a deep tradition both in the eastern and western traditions of frugality, living within your means and a contemplative life. It has always been like this. Now there is this louder voice calling for more consumption and a bigger bathroom and an SUV, but it\u2019s increasingly apparent that cannot go on. It will be something like smoking, which was everywhere 50 years ago. But now that people realise the clear link to lung cancer, this is restricted. The same will happen when people realise where material growth is taking us. It is a matter of time I think.</p> <p><strong>How do we move in that direction before the risks become unmanageable?</strong><br>To answer this, it\u2019s important not to talk in global terms. There will be many approaches which have to be tailored and targeted to each different audience. There is this pernicious idea by this [Thomas] Friedman guy that the world is flat and everything is now the same, so what works in one place can work for everyone. But that\u2019s totally wrong. For example, Denmark has nothing in common with Nigeria. What you do in each place will be different. What we need in Nigeria is more food, more growth. In Philippines we need a little more of it. And in Canada and Sweden, we need less of it. We have to look at it from different points of view. In some places we have to foster what economists call de-growth. In other places, we have to foster growth.</p> <p><strong>Your one-man statistical analysis is like the entire output of </strong><strong>the World Bank. Did this research make you feel we are closer to the end of growth than you previously realised? </strong><br>People ask me if I am an optimist or a pessimist and I say neither. I am not trying to be deliberately agnostic: this is the best conclusion I can come up with. In China, I told people how bad the environment was and the picture totally shocked people. They said: \u201cWhen will it collapse?\u201d And I\u2019d answer: \u201cIt\u2019s collapsing every day, but it\u2019s also being fixed every day.\u201d They used more coal and got more air pollution, but they also took billions from the World Bank and finally have modern water treatment in big cities. Now they are using modern farming, so they use less water for irrigation. This is how it is. This is what kind of species we are: we are stupid, we are negligent, we are tardy. But on the other hand, we are adaptable, we are smart and even as things are falling apart, we are trying to stitch them together. But the most difficult thing is to calculate the net effect. Are we up or down? For all the analysis, we don\u2019t know this.</p> <p><strong>Your book notes that the entire library of Rome, 2,000 years ago, contained about 3 gigabytes of information, but now the global internet has more than a trillion times more. You are clearly sceptical this has been a net positive or that it has improved our ability to deal with our problems.</strong><br>The growth of information is not just a flood or an explosion. Those adjectives are inadequate. We are buried under information. It\u2019s not doing anyone any good. There are satellites above us producing huge amounts of information, but there are not enough people to analyse it. Yes, computers can help and shrink the amount, but someone still has to make decisions. There is too much to grasp.</p> <p><strong>Did you experience any statgasms (statistical orgasms) is the course of the research?</strong><br>I am a biologist by training, so I was delighted to read new studies about the world\u2019s biggest trees \u2013 the redwoods and eucalyptus. They never stop growing. And for elephants, they have indeterminate patterns of growth and never really stop until they die. We humans stop when we are 18 or 19. But the biggest species on the planet keep on growing until they die.</p> <p><strong>And on human population?</strong><br>What is most remarkable is how rapid the decline has been. For more than a 100 years, the growth rate accelerated. The 1930s faster than the 20s, the 40s faster than the 30s and so on. By the 1960s, the world population was growing so fast that a famous paper in Science said that by 2024, it would be growing at an infinite rate \u2013 like a population singularity moment, which is, of course, absurd. Since then, the rate has declined every year. Population continues to grow in absolute terms, but in percentage terms it has been declining since the mid-60s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7172a2ba06cc93daf74da73ca837a0e8df9d1a96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7172a2ba06cc93daf74da73ca837a0e8df9d1a96/0_132_3957_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump holds a sign saying Trump Digs Coal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US far outstrips other countries in terms of energy consumption.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Overall, I would say the tone of the book is pessimistic, but you also mention</strong><strong> the possibility of a more optimistic </strong><strong>scenario in which the global population does not expand beyond 9</strong><strong> billion \u2013 as is currently predicted \u2013 and in which the energy transition is faster than expected.

      "bodyText": "Vaclav Smil is a distinguished professor emeritus in the faculty of environment at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. Over more than 40 years, his books on the environment, population, food and energy have steadily grown in influence. He is now seen as one of the world\u2019s foremost thinkers on development history and a master of statistical analysis. Bill Gates says he waits for new Smil books the way some people wait for the next Star Wars movie. The latest is Growth: From Microorganisms to Megacities. You are the nerd\u2019s nerd. There is perhaps no other academic who paints pictures with numbers like you. You dug up the astonishing statistic that China has poured more cement every three years since 2003 than the US managed in the entire 20th century. You calculated that in 2000, the dry mass of all the humans in the world was 125m metric tonnes compared with just 10m tonnes for all wild vertebrates. And now you explore patterns of growth, from the healthy development of forests and brains to the unhealthy increase in obesity and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Before we get into those deeper issues, can I ask if you see yourself as a nerd? Not at all. I\u2019m just an old-fashioned scientist describing the world and the lay of the land as it is. That\u2019s all there is to it. It\u2019s not good enough just to say life is better or the trains are faster. You have to bring in the numbers. This book is an exercise in buttressing what I have to say with numbers so people see these are the facts and they are difficult to dispute. Growth is a huge book \u2013 almost 200,000 words that synthesise many of your other studies, ranging across the world and exploring far into the past and future. Do you see this as your magnum opus? I have deliberately set out to write the megabook on growth. In a way, it\u2019s unwieldy and unreasonable. People can take any number of books out of it \u2013 economists can read about the growth of GDP and population; biologists can read about the growth of organisms and human bodies. But I wanted to put it all together under one roof so people could see how these things are inevitably connected and how it all shares one crystal clarity: that growth must come to an end. Our economist friends don\u2019t seem to realise that. I first came across your work while I was writing a book about the Chinese environment. Time and again, you had the data that I was looking for \u2013 and it often revealed how dubious many of the official statistics were. You have been described as a \u201cslayer of bullshit\u201d. Is that your goal? I was brought up in Czechoslovakia during the era of the Soviet bloc. Having spent 26 years of my life in the evil empire, I do not tolerate nonsense. I grew up surrounded by commie propaganda \u2013 the bright tomorrow, the great future of mankind \u2013 so I\u2019m as critical as they come. It\u2019s not my opinion. These are the facts. I don\u2019t write opinion pieces. I write things that are totally underlined by facts. You debunk overly rosy projections by techno-optimists, who say we can solve all our problems with smarter computers, and economists, who promise endless capitalist growth. In many countries, the downside of material growth now seems greater than the upside, which leads to what you call \u201canthropogenic insults to ecosystems\u201d. Is that a fair summary? Yes, I think so. Without a biosphere in a good shape, there is no life on the planet. It\u2019s very simple. That\u2019s all you need to know. The economists will tell you we can decouple growth from material consumption, but that is total nonsense. The options are quite clear from the historical evidence. If you don\u2019t manage decline, then you succumb to it and you are gone. The best hope is that you find some way to manage it. We are in a better position to do that now than we were 50 or 100 years ago, because our knowledge is much vaster. If we sit down, we can come up with something. It won\u2019t be painless, but we can come up with ways to minimise that pain. So we need to change our expectations of GDP growth? Yes, the simple fact is that however you define happiness, we know \u2013 and we have known this for ages \u2013 that the amount of GDP is not going to improve your satisfaction with life, equanimity and sense of wellbeing. Look at Japan. They are pretty rich but they are among the unhappiest people on the planet. Then who is always in the top 10 of the happiest people? It is the Philippines, which is much poorer and smitten by typhoons, yet many times more happy than their neighbours in Japan. Once you reach a certain point, the benefits of GDP growth start to level off in terms of mortality, nutrition and education. Is that point the golden mean? Is that what we should be aiming for rather than pushing until growth becomes malign, cancerous, obese and environmentally destructive? Exactly. That would be nice. We could halve our energy and material consumption and this would put us back around the level of the 1960s. We could cut down without losing anything important. Life wasn\u2019t horrible in 1960s or 70s Europe. People from Copenhagen would no longer be able to fly to Singapore for a three-day visit, but so what? Not much is going to happen to their lives. People don\u2019t realise how much slack in the system we have. You cite Kenneth Boulding\u2019s distinction between the \u201ccowboy economy\u201d and the \u201cspaceman economy\u201d. The former is wide-open spaces and seemingly endless opportunities for resource consumption. The latter is a recognition that planet Earth is more like a closed spaceship on which we need to carefully manage our resources. The challenge is to shift from one way of thinking to another. But human history is thousands of years of cowboys and only a few decades of spacemen. Aren\u2019t we hardwired? There is a deep tradition both in the eastern and western traditions of frugality, living within your means and a contemplative life. It has always been like this. Now there is this louder voice calling for more consumption and a bigger bathroom and an SUV, but it\u2019s increasingly apparent that cannot go on. It will be something like smoking, which was everywhere 50 years ago. But now that people realise the clear link to lung cancer, this is restricted. The same will happen when people realise where material growth is taking us. It is a matter of time I think. How do we move in that direction before the risks become unmanageable? To answer this, it\u2019s important not to talk in global terms. There will be many approaches which have to be tailored and targeted to each different audience. There is this pernicious idea by this [Thomas] Friedman guy that the world is flat and everything is now the same, so what works in one place can work for everyone. But that\u2019s totally wrong. For example, Denmark has nothing in common with Nigeria. What you do in each place will be different. What we need in Nigeria is more food, more growth. In Philippines we need a little more of it. And in Canada and Sweden, we need less of it. We have to look at it from different points of view. In some places we have to foster what economists call de-growth. In other places, we have to foster growth. Your one-man statistical analysis is like the entire output of the World Bank. Did this research make you feel we are closer to the end of growth than you previously realised? People ask me if I am an optimist or a pessimist and I say neither. I am not trying to be deliberately agnostic: this is the best conclusion I can come up with. In China, I told people how bad the environment was and the picture totally shocked people. They said: \u201cWhen will it collapse?\u201d And I\u2019d answer: \u201cIt\u2019s collapsing every day, but it\u2019s also being fixed every day.\u201d They used more coal and got more air pollution, but they also took billions from the World Bank and finally have modern water treatment in big cities. Now they are using modern farming, so they use less water for irrigation. This is how it is. This is what kind of species we are: we are stupid, we are negligent, we are tardy. But on the other hand, we are adaptable, we are smart and even as things are falling apart, we are trying to stitch them together. But the most difficult thing is to calculate the net effect. Are we up or down? For all the analysis, we don\u2019t know this. Your book notes that the entire library of Rome, 2,000 years ago, contained about 3 gigabytes of information, but now the global internet has more than a trillion times more. You are clearly sceptical this has been a net positive or that it has improved our ability to deal with our problems. The growth of information is not just a flood or an explosion. Those adjectives are inadequate. We are buried under information. It\u2019s not doing anyone any good. There are satellites above us producing huge amounts of information, but there are not enough people to analyse it. Yes, computers can help and shrink the amount, but someone still has to make decisions. There is too much to grasp. Did you experience any statgasms (statistical orgasms) is the course of the research? I am a biologist by training, so I was delighted to read new studies about the world\u2019s biggest trees \u2013 the redwoods and eucalyptus. They never stop growing. And for elephants, they have indeterminate patterns of growth and never really stop until they die. We humans stop when we are 18 or 19. But the biggest species on the planet keep on growing until they die. And on human population? What is most remarkable is how rapid the decline has been. For more than a 100 years, the growth rate accelerated. The 1930s faster than the 20s, the 40s faster than the 30s and so on. By the 1960s, the world population was growing so fast that a famous paper in Science said that by 2024, it would be growing at an infinite rate \u2013 like a population singularity moment, which is, of course, absurd. Since then, the rate has declined every year. Population continues to grow in absolute terms, but in percentage terms it has been declining since the mid-60s. Overall, I would say the tone of the book is pessimistic, but you also mention the possibility of a more optimistic scenario in which the global population does not expand beyond 9 billion \u2013 as is currently predicted \u2013 and in which the energy transition is faster than expected. Even if material demands peak before 2050, that still leaves us several decades of rising pressure. Given the already apparent strains on the climate, the soil, biodiversity and social stability, how do we get over this dangerous bulge? That is the difficult part.

Lansman served as director of operations for Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign. After Corbyn was elected as the leader of the Labour party in 2015, Lansman founded Momentum, a pro-Corbyn campaign group.<br></p>\n    <p>Momentum, often described as a \u2018party within a party\u2019, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/the-radical-proposals-that-labour-will-debate-in-brighton\">radically transformed the Labour party</a> over the last four years. Local groups have challenged party orthodoxies and national membership rules, and fought to get their activists selected.</p>\n    <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the Labour party to become a faction fight,\u201d Lansman said in a 2016 interview with the Guardian. \u201cWhat I want is a level playing field. I want the Labour party to be able to have a democratic debate.\u201d But in recent weeks, Lansman, and Momentum, are back in the news for being key figures behind another Labour party civil war.</p>\n    <p>Lansman was behind the move to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/19/labour-student-wing-to-fight-partys-decision-to-abolish-organisation\">scrap Labour\u2019s 40-year-old student wing last week</a>, arguing the group needs reforming and had not paid its affiliation fees. Critics described the move as a cynical attempt to shut down a \u201cmoderate\u201d wing of the party. Lansman also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/20/momentum-bid-to-abolish-deputy-leader-tom-watsons-post\">tabled a last-minute motion</a> at the NEC on Friday night calling for Watson\u2019s job to be scrapped. The motion was withdrawn after Corbyn intervened.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The chair of the NEC initially ruled Lansman\u2019s motion out of order, but NEC members agreed to return to the issue on Saturday morning. If the policy was agreed, it would have been recommended to Labour members as a change to party rules, which would then have to be approved by conference.</p> \n<h2><strong>Why </strong><strong>did Lansman want to abolish the role of deputy leader?</strong></h2> \n<p>Watson\u2019s position on Brexit and his vocal criticism of Corbyn has put him at odds with the leadership and his allies. Corbyn allies believe Watson is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/labour-members-to-push-for-anti-brexit-stance-at-conference\">using the issue of Brexit</a> to drive a wedge between the Labour leader and the party\u2019s overwhelmingly pro-remain activists.</p> \n<p>A Momentum source previously told the Guardian: \u201cNo one person is more important than beating Boris Johnson, ending austerity and tackling the climate emergency. We just can\u2019t afford to go into an election with a deputy leader set on wrecking Labour\u2019s chances.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>How did the Labour party and its supporters respond?</strong></h2> \n<p>The news was met with a ferocious backlash from unions and Labour MPs. The former prime minister Tony Blair said a decision to abolish the post of deputy leader would be \u201cundemocratic, damaging and politically dangerous\u201d.</p> \n<p>The former Labour leader Ed Miliband said: \u201cThe move to abolish the deputy leader post without warning or debate is undemocratic, wrong and should not happen. Those who came up with the idea for the eve of Labour conference have taken leave of their senses.\u201d</p> \n<p>The leaders of Unison and the GMB, two of the three big unions affiliated to Labour, immediately attacked the attempt to remove Watson while the Ilford North MP, Wes Streeting, tweeted that the move to remove the deputy leader was \u201coutrageous, it\u2019s self-destructive and must stop\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2f43b555-fccc-4196-8b13-8f380aeabee9\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Tom Watson, who has been Labour\u2019s deputy leader since 2015, has been an MP since 2001. The 52-year-old served as a minister in the Labour government and was appointed the deputy chair of the NEC by Ed Miliband.<br></p>\n    <p>Watson stepped in to personally handle complaints in the midst of Labour\u2019s antisemitism crisis.

      "bodyText": "Has Tom Watson been removed as deputy leader? No, but there was strong speculation he would be after Jon Lansman, the founder of the pro-Corbyn campaign group, Momentum, tabled a last-minute motion at the party\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC) on Friday night calling for Watson\u2019s job to be scrapped. The attempt to abolish Watson\u2019s post of deputy leader comes as allies of Jeremy Corbyn threatened to plunge the Labour party into a fresh civil war on the eve of its annual conference. The chair of the NEC initially ruled Lansman\u2019s motion out of order, but NEC members agreed to return to the issue on Saturday morning. If the policy was agreed, it would have been recommended to Labour members as a change to party rules, which would then have to be approved by conference. Why did Lansman want to abolish the role of deputy leader? Watson\u2019s position on Brexit and his vocal criticism of Corbyn has put him at odds with the leadership and his allies. Corbyn allies believe Watson is using the issue of Brexit to drive a wedge between the Labour leader and the party\u2019s overwhelmingly pro-remain activists. A Momentum source previously told the Guardian: \u201cNo one person is more important than beating Boris Johnson, ending austerity and tackling the climate emergency. We just can\u2019t afford to go into an election with a deputy leader set on wrecking Labour\u2019s chances.\u201d How did the Labour party and its supporters respond? The news was met with a ferocious backlash from unions and Labour MPs. The former prime minister Tony Blair said a decision to abolish the post of deputy leader would be \u201cundemocratic, damaging and politically dangerous\u201d. The former Labour leader Ed Miliband said: \u201cThe move to abolish the deputy leader post without warning or debate is undemocratic, wrong and should not happen. Those who came up with the idea for the eve of Labour conference have taken leave of their senses.\u201d The leaders of Unison and the GMB, two of the three big unions affiliated to Labour, immediately attacked the attempt to remove Watson while the Ilford North MP, Wes Streeting, tweeted that the move to remove the deputy leader was \u201coutrageous, it\u2019s self-destructive and must stop\u201d. As for Watson, he described the move to abolish his post as a \u201cdrive-by shooting\u201d. What did Corbyn do? As anger began to build on Saturday morning, Corbyn was forced to defuse the attempt to oust Watson. At a meeting of Labour\u2019s NEC on Saturday, Corbyn proposed a review of the deputy leader post instead of abolishing it, which was accepted by the group. After his intervention, Corbyn told reporters outside the conference centre that he enjoyed working with Watson. What happens next? The deputy leader post will be reviewed at Labour party\u2019s conference. Lansman said he supported Corbyn\u2019s proposal and tweeted: \u201cWe need to make sure the role is properly accountable to the membership while also unifying the party at conference. In my view, this review is absolutely the best way of doing that.\u201d",

Now, almost the entire defence and some of the midfield (Sissoko/Eriksen) needs to be replaced in the short and mid-term. Despite all this, when they\u2019re trailing in a game you can never count them out of the game. That resilience is probably Poch\u2019s biggest achievement and hopefully will transcend even his time with the club.\u201d</p> <p>Is the squad that thin? I think the problem \u2013 in terms of catching City and Liverpool \u2013 is the first XI rather than the back-up. They\u2019re still the third best team in England, though, which is only a slight decline from 2015-17.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8616098f08f30dc5bbfacd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-21T12:22:55.546Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Half-time reading</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/20/barcelonas-ansu-fati-cleared-to-play-for-spain-after-being-granted-passport\">Barcelona's Ansu Fati cleared to play for Spain after being granted passport</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d86150c8f08f30dc5bbfac7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-21T12:20:51.171Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Half time: Leicester 0-1 Spurs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Peep peep!

Here\u2019s James Maddison \u201cWe are a top side now \u2013 I think we have to be seen as one of those top sides. Nobody will want to come to this place when it\u2019s rocking like this. If you look at our performances at Chelsea and United, we came away shaking our heads in disappointment because we didn\u2019t get what we deserved. We\u2019re showing we\u2019re a big threat now. \u201cYou get that little lift [when the opposition have a goal disallowed by VAR]. I\u2019ve had some chances this season, and I need to score more goals if I want to take my game to the next level. I\u2019m a little bit worried about the ankle, but I\u2019ll go and see how it is now.\u201d That was great fun. Harry Kane scored an extraordinary goal to give Spurs the lead. Ricardo Pereira equalised from close range and then James Maddison scored a delightful late winner. He is going places; so are Leicester. Peep peep! Leicester move up to second in the table, at least for a couple of hours, after a stirring comeback victory. It was a fine game between two excellent sides, but Leicester just about deserved to win after an excellent second-half performance. 90+4 min Leicester look reasonably comfortable, despite the inevitable late pressure from Spurs. 90+3 min Maddison is still out there but he can\u2019t run. That\u2019s a worry, especially if it\u2019s an ankle ligament injury. 90+1 min There will be six minutes of added time. 90 min The impressive Soyuncu makes a couple of important interceptions, one with his head and one with his left foot. Brendan Rodgers is developing a really fine young side. 89 min Maddison is limping heavily. He\u2019s going to continue, though, as Leicester have used all their substitutes. 88 min Maddison has a problem with his left ankle. He landed awkwardly while trying to play a through pass, and is receiving treatment. 87 min Lucas Moura replaces Ndombele for Spurs. The most exciting young player in England gives Leicester the lead with a superb goal. Choudhury played a short pass to Maddison 25 yards from goal; he took two quick touches to set humself up and then belted a low, curling shot that snaked past the diving Gazzaniga and into the corner. That\u2019s a lovely goal. A brilliant goal from James Maddison! 84 min Leicester make their last substitution: Youri Tielemans off, Hamza Choudhury on. 84 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Andrew Buddery. \u201cI thought VAR was supposed to eliminate clear and obvious errors, not make them.\u201d 83 min Gray is booked straight away for a studs-up lunge on Rose. That could have been a red card. Just before that, Kane shot too close to Schmeichel after a nice Spurs move. 82 min A Leicester substitution: Demarai Gray replaces Harvey Barnes. 82 min Rose\u2019s cross clears everyone in the middle and comes to Aurier beyond the far post. He takes a touch and lashes a low shot that goes well wide of the far post. That was a good chance. 80 min \u201cOf all the valid complaints against VAR, offsides isn\u2019t one of them,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cHe. Was. Offside. Yes, by less than an inch.\u201d But how does VAR judge when the ball is played? The split-second between the ball touching the foot and then leaving it makes all the difference. I\u2019d like to see how that works before I trust it on such tight decisions. 79 min Erik Lamela is replaced by Christian Eriksen. 79 min Son quickens the pace, skinning Tielemans and hitting a dangerous cross that is palmed away by Schmeichel. Evans completes the clearance. Moments later, Kane misses with an attempted overhead kick. 77 min The Leicester fans are making a fair old noise. It does feel like the kind of game that will have a late winner, although I\u2019m not sure who will get it. 74 min \u201cThe Son offside call on VAR,\u201d says Sandile Xaso. \u201cThis cannot be our sport, this cannot be right.\u201d You\u2019re right: it\u2019s not right, and it\u2019s not our sport any more. 73 min Leicester are pushing for a winner. Maddison threads a nice pass down the inside-right channel to Vardy, who bullets a rising drive just past the angle of post and bar. I think Gazzaniga had it covered. Yep, this one counts. The move was started by Barnes, who found Vardy on the left side of the penalty area. His cross deflected off Alderweireld and fell perfectly for Ricardo, whose close-range shot hit the sliding Rose and beat Gazzaniga. Leicester are level! 67 min A substitution apiece: Praet for Perez, Wanyama for Sissoko. VAR has decided that Son was 0.0000001 centimetres offside in the build-up. There\u2019s a VAR check for offside against Son. Leicester will feel they\u2019ve been mugged. Soyuncu made a fine tackle on Son in the box, but Kane picked up the loose ball and found Aurier in space on the edge of the area. He controlled the ball and lashed a shot that took a slight deflection before spinning past Schmeichel. A goal was coming - but it\u2019s Spurs who have scored it! 63 min It feels like a Leicester goal is coming, and Chilwell wins another corner on the left. 62 min Barnes shifts the ball to the side of Aurier and hammers a low cross that flashes right across the face of goal. 60 min Barnes heads wide from eight yards. It was a difficult chance, because Ricardo\u2019s lofted cross had no pace on it at all. But the build-up play was lovely, particularly Maddison\u2019s control in a phonebox as he pulled down Perez\u2019s pass from the right. 58 min: Son misses an excellent chance! Spurs broke from the Leicester corner and should probably have gone 2-0 ahead. Winks, on the left, played an angled through pass to find Son in the area, but he dragged a left-footed shot wide of the far post. 57 min: Good save from Gazzaniga! Tielemans slipped a through pass to Vardy, who surged into the area and hit a left-footed shot across goal. The sliding Vertonghen took some of the heat out of the shot, having done brilliantly to stay with Vardy, and Gazzaniga dived to his left to push it away. Rose completed the job by putting the loose ball behind for a corner. 56 min Here\u2019s Ian Copestake. \u201cAs a chant in response to Leicester fans\u2019 implying ref bias, I am not sure if \u2018Paul Tierney\u2019s done really well, in very difficult circumstances\u2019 will scan.\u201d I can add a few effs and cees if you think it will help. 55 min Son finds Lamela in a bit of space on the edge of the D. He takes a touch and then, as defenders converge, whips a shot over the bar. 53 min Maddison\u2019s corner is headed away by Lamela. 52 min Tielemans wins a corner after a nice run down the inside-left channel. Leicester look much sharper than they did towards the end of the first half. 50 min Leicester have started the second half really well. After a nice move down the left, Chilwell\u2019s early cross is just too far in front of Vardy. 46 min Barnes beats Aurier on the left of the area and hits a shot that is headed away by Alderweireld. Ndidi\u2019s follow-up dribbles wide. 46 min Peep peep! Leicester begin the second half. \u201cWas the VAR decision correct?\u201d says Liam. \u201cThey looked at the moment when the shot was struck but if you watch it again none of the Leicester strikers followed the shot they ran back to get onside and then ran in. If this is correct will a goal scored by a keeper be disallowed because a striker near the halfway line was offside?\u201d Yeah, it was the correct decision. Perez had an advantage by being in an offside position, because he was able to get to the loose ball before the Leicester defenders. Thus it counts as the same phase of play. At least I think that\u2019s the logic. To be honest, I\u2019ve given up trying to understand how football works in a post-VAR world. \u201cSome half-time thoughts on Spurs: while the pundits want to declare the Pochettino project in decline, as a fan I see them as trying to maintain a high level whilst navigating a transition,\u201d says Matthew Carpenter-Arevalo. \u201cThe thinness of the squad showed cracks as they made their turn at the end of last season. Now, almost the entire defence and some of the midfield (Sissoko/Eriksen) needs to be replaced in the short and mid-term. Despite all this, when they\u2019re trailing in a game you can never count them out of the game. That resilience is probably Poch\u2019s biggest achievement and hopefully will transcend even his time with the club.\u201d Is the squad that thin? I think the problem \u2013 in terms of catching City and Liverpool \u2013 is the first XI rather than the back-up. They\u2019re still the third best team in England, though, which is only a slight decline from 2015-17. Half-time reading Peep peep! Spurs lead through a unique goal from Harry Kane. See you in 10 minutes for the second half! 43 min \u201cLamela\u2019s got that no-look look on,\u201d says Jeremy Dresner. \u201cA very fun player to watch when he is passing like this.\u201d That he is. I love the way he hugs the ball on his left foot. 41 min Lamela, who has had so much space between the centre-backs and Ndidi, surges forward and finds Kane on the right of the box. His left-footed shot is surprisingly tame and Schmeichel makes an easy save. 39 min Perez, found by Tielemans, thrashes a shot towards the near post that is beaten around the post by Gazzaniga. 37 min \u201cLightning quick beautiful goal,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cHow did Kane do that?!!\u201d Instinct, the footballer\u2019s best friend. 33 min Ricardo Pereira shoots a few yards wide from distance. Gazzaniga had it covered. 31 min Lamela finds Kane, who drags a low shot well wide from the edge of the area. That goal, though. It reminded me a little bit of Gianluca Vialli\u2019s incredible sliding header against Bari in 1991-92. What a stunning piece of improvisation. Son, found by Lamela, moved to the edge of the area and backheeled the ball into the path of the onrushing Kane. He was bumped by Soyuncu, which meant he was off balance as he dragged the ball past the last man Evans. By the time Kane was in a position to shoot he was in the process of falling flat on his face. Yet he still had the awareness and ability to chop down on the ball, stunning it into the ground so that it bounced over Schmeichel\u2019s shoulder and into the net. That\u2019s an astonishing goal. What a goal from Harry Kane! 28 min That\u2019s better from Perez, who drags an angled through pass to Vardy on the left side of the box. His low cross-shot ricochets across the six-yard box and eventually behind for a goalkick. 26 min A hideous touch from Perez, who looks low on confidence, ruins a promising Leicester break. 25 min Perez is down after being caught in the face by a flailing arm from Rose. It was accidental. 22 min \u201cYou\u2019re not fit to referee\u201d chant the Leicester fans. Paul Tierney\u2019s done really well, I think, in very difficult circumstances. 21 min Rose goes over in the area after a challenge from Evans, and Paul Tierney turns down Spurs\u2019 penalty appeals. There was definitely contact, although I think Rose ran into Evans. 19 min Sissoko definitely won the ball, although he cleaned Maddison out in his follow through. I think he slipped as well, which made it look even worse. Some people would have given a red card; others wouldn\u2019t have even given a free-kick. 18 min Sissoko is booked. I\u2019d like to see that again. The Leicester players went ballistic, and he absolutely wiped Maddison out. The Leicester fans are chanting \u2018VAR\u2019. 18 min Sissoko could be off here. He\u2019s absolutely flattened Maddison, an old-fashioned man-and-ball tackle. A Leicester corner was half-cleared to Tielemans, whose stinging shot was fumbled by Gazzaniga. That led to a scramble in the six-yard box involving Perez, among others, before Ndidi scored from close range. Replays showed that Perez was offside when Tielemans had the original shot, and so the goal was disallowed. Yes, it\u2019s offside. Hang on, this could be VARed. Ndidi scores after a mistake from Gazzaniga! 15 min: Gazzaniga saves from Maddison! It was a gorgeous, twinkle-toed run from Maddison, who danced past Winks and then Alderweireld in the area before hitting a low shot from a tight angle that was kicked behind by Gazzaniga. 13 min Nice play from Maddison, who moves classily past Sissoko and reaches the edge of the area before trying a curling shot that goes a few yards away. 12 min Not for the first time, Aurier wasted a promising position with a poor cross. Spurs are playing well, though, and have had 71 per cent of the possession so far. 11 min Soyuncu, in his own area, sits Aurier on his backside with a confident turn. The crowd enjoyed that. 8 min Maddison\u2019s inswinging corner is headed on at the near post by Evans and flashes right across the six-yard box. 7 min Lamela has had a lot of the ball in the first few minutes. Both attacks look really sharp, and Vardy scurries down the left to win the first corner. 4 min Both sides are full of attacking intent. It\u2019s been a brilliant start to the game. 3 min Now Kane tries his luck with a disguised shot from 25 yards. Schmeichel moves smartly across his line and does well to hold on to the shot. 3 min At the other end, Son shoots just wide of the far post from a tight angle. It\u2019s been a cracking start to the game. 2 min Beautiful play from Leicester. Tielemans plays a sharp pass infield towards Barnes, who runs over the ball and allows it to run to Maddison. He plays it first time through to Barnes, who is caught in two minds - shoot or control - and ends up poking a fairly tame shot at Gazzaniga from 15 yards. 2 min \u201cAlways good to be committed to a grumble and get it in early,\u201d says Jeremy Dresner. \u201cWhy are Spurs after returning from a cauldron on a hot day in Greece on Wednesday night playing the early game on Saturday? Is the role of the FA to maintain fairness or protect the players? Either way it seems remiss of them.\u201d I think the TV fixtures were chosen before the Champions League draw, although I take your point. Does an extra two and a half hours really make much difference? I failed my GCSE in Footballer Knack, so I\u2019m not sure. 1 min Peep peep! Spurs, in white, kick off from right to left. Leicester are in blue. The players are in the tunnel. It\u2019s a beautiful day in Leicester, and this has the whiff of a cracker. \u201cSpurs are fourth,\u201d says Simon Betterton, \u201cand they\u2019re closer to the bottom than the top!\u201d That\u2019s a great spot. They\u2019re six points above Watford and seven behind Liverpool. Some pre-match reading Spurs are without Hugo Lloris, whose wife has just given birth, so Paulo Gazzaniga starts. Leicester City (4-1-4-1) Schmeichel; Ricardo, Evans, Soyuncu, Chilwell; Ndidi; Perez, Tielemans, Maddison, Barnes; Vardy. Substitutes: Ward, Justin, Morgan, Gray, Albrighton, Choudhury, Praet. Tottenham Hotspur (4-D-2) Gazzaniga; Aurier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Rose; Winks; Sissoko, Ndombele; Lamela; Kane, Son. Substitutes: Whiteman, Davies, Wanyama, Dier, Eriksen, Moura, Skipp. Referee Paul Tierney. Hello. Leicester might be the most intriguing team in the Premier League. They have a posse of brilliant young players and are the most likely team to break the sexopoly that has been in place since Leicester won the whole goddamn thing four seasons ago. Early days and all that, but they are level on points with Spurs, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United after five games. A statement victory today, against a Spurs team whose behaviour of late has been a bit odd, would reinforce the feeling that they are ready to damage the glass ceiling. Kick off is at 12.30pm.",

      "body": "<p>Zelimkhan Khangoshvili spent a long time living on the edge. He survived several years of partisan warfare against Russian forces in Chechnya during the early 2000s. He survived an assassination attempt in Georgia\u2019s capital Tbilisi in 2015, a spray of bullets hitting him in the arm and shoulder. He survived a stint living in Ukraine, where he was tipped off about another planned attack and went into hiding. Finally, he arrived in Germany towards the end of 2016, and breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>\u201cI think he felt much safer here. He was only thinking about building a bright future in Germany, also for the children, not about fighting or going back there,\u201d said Manana Tsatieva, Khangoshvili\u2019s ex-wife, who lives in Germany with their four children.</p> <p>But it was here, in the centre of Europe, that Khangoshvili finally met his end. Late last month, shortly after leaving home to go to the mosque,<strong> </strong>a man approached him in Berlin\u2019s Kleiner Tiergarten and shot him twice in the head. He died immediately.</p> <p>The suspected assassin, who was held by police soon after he was spotted tossing a wig and a gun into the river, has so far maintained his silence. He was travelling on a Russian passport apparently issued under a false identity, boosting suspicions about a hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin\" title=\"\">ordered by Russian security services</a> or by the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3fb46e3dab4da174aa8a44b23a24efdf9becd786\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fb46e3dab4da174aa8a44b23a24efdf9becd786/18_0_576_720/400.jpg\" alt=\"Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a former Chechen separatist commander, shot dead in Berlin in August.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a former Chechen separatist commander, shot dead in Berlin in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whoever ordered the hit, the killing has once again underlined the perilous position of thousands of Chechens in Europe, fearing retribution from home but unable to win asylum. Germany had rejected a request for asylum for Khangoshvili and his family, and ignored a request to give him protection because of threats on his life.</p> <p>Khangoshvili was the latest in a trail of killings over the past decade in which insurgency figures and other enemies of Kadyrov have been shot dead, wherever they may be hiding.</p> <p>In 2009, Kadyrov\u2019s former bodyguard Umar Israilov, who had publicly stated he had been personally tortured by Kadyrov, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/15/chechen-murder-austria-russia\" title=\"\">shot dead in Vienna</a>. The same year, a political rival to Kadyrov, Sulim Yamadayev, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/06/kadyrov-yamadayev-chechnya-dubai-kremlin\" title=\"\">shot dead in Dubai</a>. Local police accused a Chechen politician close to Kadyrov of supplying the murder weapon. There have been half a dozen prominent Chechens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/10/murder-istanbul-chechen-kremlin-russia-abdulvakhid-edelgireyev\" title=\"\">killed in Istanbul</a> over the past decade, with Turkish authorities believing Russian security services are involved. And in Ukraine, where Chechens have joined volunteer battalions fighting pro-Russian forces, the Chechen fighter Amina Okuyeva <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/31/russia-blamed-for-attack-on-chechen-couple-who-fought-with-ukrainian-forces\" title=\"\">was killed in an ambush of her car in 2017</a>. Her husband and battalion commander, Adam Osmayev, was wounded but survived. Previously, the pair had been targeted by a Chechen hitman pretending to be a French journalist from <em>Le Monde</em> who had come to interview them.</p> <p>Chechnya under Kadyrov has become one of the world\u2019s most sinister <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/tag/chechnya\" title=\"\">human rights blackspots</a>. The son of a former independence fighter who switched sides, Kadyrov has used Russian cash to rebuild the republic from the ruins of war and has been given a free hand to rule as he pleases in return for pledging allegiance to Vladimir Putin. In recent years, his security forces have carried out extrajudicial round-ups of a wide array of groups, including suspected militants, government critics, those deemed to have the wrong kind of beard or those who are suspected of being gay. There is widespread testimony of his forces using torture.</p> <p>Unlike Khangoshvili, the majority of recent Chechen arrivals in Europe have had nothing to do with the former insurgency, and are instead those who have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23325956\" title=\"\">fled threats and torture</a>, leaving their homes as a last resort. But just like Khangoshvili, most of these people struggle to secure asylum, amid increasing hostility to migration in western Europe \u2013 especially Muslim migration.</p> <p>In Germany, Poland and other EU countries, several thousand Chechens are in legal limbo and risk deportation back to Russia, despite having what should be textbook asylum claims: victims of torture with credible threats against their lives and their families. Having made the arduous journey to western Europe, they are often dismissed as economic migrants or potential radical Islamists and told to go back home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1319f1d53471d49b2e32b63af5935bd928c44e4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1319f1d53471d49b2e32b63af5935bd928c44e4b/0_134_5064_3038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tumso Abdurakhmanov\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tumso Abdurakhmanov, a critic of the Chechen ruler, in hiding in Poland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Ebel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For many Chechen refugees, their ordeal begins in Brest, a Belarussian town close to the border with Poland. This is the closest that Chechens, who usually hold Russian passports, can get to the EU without a visa. Each morning a train leaves Brest on the short ride to the Polish border, usually with around 200 Chechens on board. They are obliged to travel in a separate carriage from other passengers.</p> <p>At the border, Polish guards pick no more than one family a day whom they allow to place an asylum claim; the rest are simply sent back on the same train. Earlier this summer a Chechen man cut his veins at the border in desperation: his reward was a stamp in his passport automatically disbarring him from any further attempts, said Enira Bronitskaya, a Belarusian rights activist.</p> <p>Ayub Abumuslimov and his family spent five months living in a cold, damp apartment in Brest, taking the train several times a week in the hope of being selected for asylum. Abumuslimov fled Chechnya after the disappearance of his brother Apti from the town of Shali in January 2017. Apti was kidnapped, along with a neighbour, and taken to the local police station. He was never seen again. Many other people disappeared at the same time, and Apti featured in a list of 27 people<a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/07/11/chechnya-names-of-27-men-slaughtered-and-buried-in-bloody-night-revealed-as-gay-purge-continues/\" title=\"\"> </a>published by the Russian newspaper <em>Novaya Gazeta</em> as potential victims of an extrajudicial execution by local law enforcement.</p> <p>The problems for the rest of the family started when they began writing complaints about what had happened. In June 2017, Abumuslimov said, his car was stopped by men in plain clothes and he was bundled into the back of another car. He was taken to an undisclosed location, where he was held and tortured for more than two months.</p> <p>Abumuslimov described simple beatings, as well as more sinister treatment, including electric shocks. The worst, he said, was salt torture, where his hands and legs were cuffed and large quantities of salt were poured into his mouth. When he was on the point of choking, he would be given water to drink, causing extreme pain as the salt passed through his body.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6388bfd8781c86c320290ede71dbe91cea86e6b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6388bfd8781c86c320290ede71dbe91cea86e6b6/0_53_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters hold portraits of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in front of the German embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia, after his death last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters hold portraits of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in front of the German embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia, after his death last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zurab Kurtsikidze/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey wanted me to sign a form saying my brother was fighting in Syria and we had no complaints about law enforcement. I refused,\u201d he said. His tormentors wore official police uniforms, though all but two of them were in masks. He was released after more than two months.</p> <p>It is not possible to verify the details of Abumuslimov\u2019s claims of torture, but they tally with an overwhelming number of similar stories from Chechens unfortunate enough to find themselves in the hands of Kadyrov\u2019s security forces. Maria Ksi\u0105\u017cak, a psychologist who is now treating Abumuslimov, said: \u201cHe displays all the signs of someone who has been through serious trauma.\u201d</p> <p>After his release, Abumuslimov and his extended family fled Chechnya for Brest, with the aim of making it to western Europe. It took them five months and 40 train journeys before Polish border guards finally allowed them to file an asylum claim. But even in Poland, he was not safe.</p> <p>While Polish authorities processed their claim in the town of Biala Podlaska, Abumuslimov gave a media interview about the family\u2019s plight. Shortly afterwards, as he was leaving a supermarket in the town, a car drove up with three people inside.

Abdurakhmanov was working for a telecommunications company in Grozny, Chechnya when he says he was apprehended as a suspected radical due to his long beard. Authorities insisted he had gone to fight in Syria, a claim he says is false. He fled to Georgia and eventually to Poland, where he started a video blog denouncing Kadyrov\u2019s regime. His YouTube videos got thousands of hits, and soon he received a phone call from Magomed Daudov, Kadyrov\u2019s right-hand man, widely known in Chechnya by his nickname, Lord. Abdurakhmanov recorded the call and posted the recording online.</p> <p>Aware that Abdurakhmanov was abroad and had a large following, Lord did not immediately resort to threats. Instead, he promised they could discuss issues openly, and cajoled him into returning to Chechnya to help Kadyrov, whom Lord called the \u201cpadishah\u201d or \u201cemperor\u201d.</p> <p>As he failed to make headway, Lord got angrier, demanding to know Abdurakhmanov\u2019s address in Poland. He later publicly <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/chechen-blogger-says-taking-blood-feud-threat-seriously/29819592.html\" title=\"\">declared \u201cblood revenge\u201d</a> on the blogger. Later, Abdurakhmanov\u2019s family back in Chechnya were filmed at the village mosque denouncing their relative, in footage that was posted online. \u201cIf they want to, let them kill him or do what they want with him. We have been gathered here today to announce that we no longer accept responsibility for him,\u201d said one of his relatives, in a recording Abdurakhmanov believes was made under duress.</p> <p>\u201cI know they\u2019re hunting for me. They\u2019re searching for me, so of course I am taking measures to protect myself,\u201d said Abdurakhmanov on a Skype call from an undisclosed location in Poland. Polish authorities have accepted there is a threat to his life in Russia, and have granted asylum to his wife and three children. But they have rejected his claim on national security grounds. The evidence that motivated the decision is classified.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t defend myself from the accusations because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m being accused of. I have not been questioned at all; there has not been a single discussion with the authorities,\u201d he said, declining to give his location, except to say he was moving frequently. He said he was now in hiding both from Chechen assassins and from Polish authorities, certain that if they detain him and deport him to Russia, he will be killed.</p> <p>It appears possible that European asylum authorities are relying on Russian accusations of terrorist leanings when denying asylum applications. It is true that in recent years, hundreds of Chechens became radicalised, with some joining Islamic State and even taking senior positions in the group. It is also true that Chechen and Russian authorities have used accusations of radical Islamism as a pretext to arrest or torture people.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a very complicated situation, but we end up with cases of people who very clearly need asylum and are being rejected,\u201d said Sokirianskaya.</p> <p>Tsatieva, ex-wife of Khangoshvili, hopes that his murder may finally prompt German authorities to positively assess her asylum claim and those of her children. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult time for me and the children. We are afraid of what may happen next, and there is still no decision regarding our asylum in Germany.\u201d</p> <p>Ksi\u0105\u017cak, who has treated Chechen and other victims of torture for more than two decades, said removing the threat of deportation from traumatised refugees was the best way to help them recover and integrate. \u201cWhen protection to torture survivors is finally granted, the fears that haunted them slowly dissolve. Trust and family relations improve and social integration follows. But if they live in constant fear it is very hard for them to recover.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Chechnya\u2019s troubled history</strong></h2> <p>Chechnya\u2019s history over the past three decades has been both tragic and tangled, as the original fight for independence from Russia in the 1990s fragmented.</p> <p>When Vladimir Putin first came to power in Russia in 1999, he launched the second Chechen war with a ruthless air campaign.

      "bodyText": "Zelimkhan Khangoshvili spent a long time living on the edge. He survived several years of partisan warfare against Russian forces in Chechnya during the early 2000s. He survived an assassination attempt in Georgia\u2019s capital Tbilisi in 2015, a spray of bullets hitting him in the arm and shoulder. He survived a stint living in Ukraine, where he was tipped off about another planned attack and went into hiding. Finally, he arrived in Germany towards the end of 2016, and breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cI think he felt much safer here. He was only thinking about building a bright future in Germany, also for the children, not about fighting or going back there,\u201d said Manana Tsatieva, Khangoshvili\u2019s ex-wife, who lives in Germany with their four children. But it was here, in the centre of Europe, that Khangoshvili finally met his end. Late last month, shortly after leaving home to go to the mosque, a man approached him in Berlin\u2019s Kleiner Tiergarten and shot him twice in the head. He died immediately. The suspected assassin, who was held by police soon after he was spotted tossing a wig and a gun into the river, has so far maintained his silence. He was travelling on a Russian passport apparently issued under a false identity, boosting suspicions about a hit ordered by Russian security services or by the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov. Whoever ordered the hit, the killing has once again underlined the perilous position of thousands of Chechens in Europe, fearing retribution from home but unable to win asylum. Germany had rejected a request for asylum for Khangoshvili and his family, and ignored a request to give him protection because of threats on his life. Khangoshvili was the latest in a trail of killings over the past decade in which insurgency figures and other enemies of Kadyrov have been shot dead, wherever they may be hiding. In 2009, Kadyrov\u2019s former bodyguard Umar Israilov, who had publicly stated he had been personally tortured by Kadyrov, was shot dead in Vienna. The same year, a political rival to Kadyrov, Sulim Yamadayev, was shot dead in Dubai. Local police accused a Chechen politician close to Kadyrov of supplying the murder weapon. There have been half a dozen prominent Chechens killed in Istanbul over the past decade, with Turkish authorities believing Russian security services are involved. And in Ukraine, where Chechens have joined volunteer battalions fighting pro-Russian forces, the Chechen fighter Amina Okuyeva was killed in an ambush of her car in 2017. Her husband and battalion commander, Adam Osmayev, was wounded but survived. Previously, the pair had been targeted by a Chechen hitman pretending to be a French journalist from Le Monde who had come to interview them. Chechnya under Kadyrov has become one of the world\u2019s most sinister human rights blackspots. The son of a former independence fighter who switched sides, Kadyrov has used Russian cash to rebuild the republic from the ruins of war and has been given a free hand to rule as he pleases in return for pledging allegiance to Vladimir Putin. In recent years, his security forces have carried out extrajudicial round-ups of a wide array of groups, including suspected militants, government critics, those deemed to have the wrong kind of beard or those who are suspected of being gay. There is widespread testimony of his forces using torture. Unlike Khangoshvili, the majority of recent Chechen arrivals in Europe have had nothing to do with the former insurgency, and are instead those who have fled threats and torture, leaving their homes as a last resort. But just like Khangoshvili, most of these people struggle to secure asylum, amid increasing hostility to migration in western Europe \u2013 especially Muslim migration. In Germany, Poland and other EU countries, several thousand Chechens are in legal limbo and risk deportation back to Russia, despite having what should be textbook asylum claims: victims of torture with credible threats against their lives and their families. Having made the arduous journey to western Europe, they are often dismissed as economic migrants or potential radical Islamists and told to go back home. For many Chechen refugees, their ordeal begins in Brest, a Belarussian town close to the border with Poland. This is the closest that Chechens, who usually hold Russian passports, can get to the EU without a visa. Each morning a train leaves Brest on the short ride to the Polish border, usually with around 200 Chechens on board. They are obliged to travel in a separate carriage from other passengers. At the border, Polish guards pick no more than one family a day whom they allow to place an asylum claim; the rest are simply sent back on the same train. Earlier this summer a Chechen man cut his veins at the border in desperation: his reward was a stamp in his passport automatically disbarring him from any further attempts, said Enira Bronitskaya, a Belarusian rights activist. Ayub Abumuslimov and his family spent five months living in a cold, damp apartment in Brest, taking the train several times a week in the hope of being selected for asylum. Abumuslimov fled Chechnya after the disappearance of his brother Apti from the town of Shali in January 2017. Apti was kidnapped, along with a neighbour, and taken to the local police station. He was never seen again. Many other people disappeared at the same time, and Apti featured in a list of 27 people published by the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta as potential victims of an extrajudicial execution by local law enforcement. The problems for the rest of the family started when they began writing complaints about what had happened. In June 2017, Abumuslimov said, his car was stopped by men in plain clothes and he was bundled into the back of another car. He was taken to an undisclosed location, where he was held and tortured for more than two months. Abumuslimov described simple beatings, as well as more sinister treatment, including electric shocks. The worst, he said, was salt torture, where his hands and legs were cuffed and large quantities of salt were poured into his mouth. When he was on the point of choking, he would be given water to drink, causing extreme pain as the salt passed through his body. \u201cThey wanted me to sign a form saying my brother was fighting in Syria and we had no complaints about law enforcement. I refused,\u201d he said. His tormentors wore official police uniforms, though all but two of them were in masks. He was released after more than two months. It is not possible to verify the details of Abumuslimov\u2019s claims of torture, but they tally with an overwhelming number of similar stories from Chechens unfortunate enough to find themselves in the hands of Kadyrov\u2019s security forces. Maria Ksi\u0105\u017cak, a psychologist who is now treating Abumuslimov, said: \u201cHe displays all the signs of someone who has been through serious trauma.\u201d After his release, Abumuslimov and his extended family fled Chechnya for Brest, with the aim of making it to western Europe. It took them five months and 40 train journeys before Polish border guards finally allowed them to file an asylum claim. But even in Poland, he was not safe. While Polish authorities processed their claim in the town of Biala Podlaska, Abumuslimov gave a media interview about the family\u2019s plight. Shortly afterwards, as he was leaving a supermarket in the town, a car drove up with three people inside. They tried to drag him into the back seat but he fought back, dropped his shopping and ran. \u201cA couple of days later I was called from a Russian number and a Chechen voice said, \u2018You thought we won\u2019t find you in Poland? We\u2019ll find you anywhere.\u2019 \u201d The family fled to Germany, where they lodged a new asylum claim, but have so far been rejected due to the regulation that asylum seekers must apply in the \u201cfirst safe country\u201d, which German authorities deem to be Poland. There are many Chechens with similar stories who do not speak publicly for fear of reprisals against their families back in Chechnya, but Abumuslimov said he and his family want to go public because they refuse to be intimidated, and want to get justice for Apti. They are also launching a case against Russia at the European Court of Human Rights. \u201cThe most unbelievable violations occur on a daily basis in Chechnya, it is by far the worst place in Europe for rights abuses, but because Kadyrov silences the victims of violence, we get a lot of information and evidence that we can\u2019t use, because if we do the whole family will be targeted,\u201d said Russian rights activist Ekaterina Sokirianskaya.

The former Baptist preacher believed the ills of Victorian society stemmed largely from alcohol, and saw a chance to spread the word via Britain\u2019s flourishing rail network.</p> <p>It would be another four years before Cook got into the tourist business proper, organising train trips from Leicester, Nottingham and Derby to Liverpool \u2013 this time for profit.</p> <p>Then, in 1846, he ran the first of the Scottish tours that would soon become a lucrative operation. He conveyed 350 wide-eyed Sassenachs by train and steamboat to Glasgow, and for customers travelling for the first time, he offered guidebooks such as <em>Cook\u2019s Scottish Tourist Practical Directory</em> \u2013 which had a chapter headed \u201cIs It Safe for Ladies to Join in Highland Tours?\u201d</p> <p>Within a decade, Cook was running continental trips: he personally conducted a trip from Harwich to Antwerp, Brussels, Cologne, Heidelberg and Strasbourg that ended up in Paris for the International Exhibition in 1855.</p> <p>The Leicester-based company became more ambitious, especially after Thomas\u2019s son John Mason Cook joined. In 1865 they open their first travel agency on Fleet Street in London and the following year Cook junior led its first trip to America.</p> <p>The world continued to shrink, and in 1873 Thomas Cook completed his first round-the-globe tour, marketed as \u201cLondon to London\u201d, for 200 guineas. About this time the firm became one of the first to use travellers\u2019 cheques: it called them \u201ccircular notes\u201d.</p> <p>John took over in 1879 and ran the firm until his death 20 years later, when his three sons inherited Thomas Cook &amp; Son. Its success continued into the 20th century as the skies opened up, with the company chalking up another first when it offered \u201cpleasure trips by air\u201d in 1919.</p> <p>In 1928 the family sold up to the Belgian owners of the Orient Express, but the second world war saw it become part of the nationalised British Railways. After the war, sales took off again with the era of package holidays. By 1950, more than a million Britons were travelling abroad each year, mainly to France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland.</p> <p>Thomas Cook returned to private ownership in 1972 and has seen a series of mergers and takeovers. In 2007, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/13/travel.travelnews\" title=\"\">merged with the UK-listed owner of Airtours, MyTravel Group</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/22/thomas-cook-shares-plunge\" title=\"\">nearly collapsed</a> in 2011 but was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/26/thomas-cook-secures-deal-with-banks?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">bailed out by its banks</a>.

      "bodyText": "By today\u2019s standards of all-inclusive resorts with free bars and infinity pools, the first Thomas Cook holiday, which whisked customers 12 miles by train from Leicester to a temperance meeting in Loughborough, sounds like a hard sell. But the excursion, organised in 1841 by Derbyshire cabinet-maker Thomas Cook for 500 like-minded supporters, laid the foundations of a business that made him the father of modern tourism. The former Baptist preacher believed the ills of Victorian society stemmed largely from alcohol, and saw a chance to spread the word via Britain\u2019s flourishing rail network. It would be another four years before Cook got into the tourist business proper, organising train trips from Leicester, Nottingham and Derby to Liverpool \u2013 this time for profit. Then, in 1846, he ran the first of the Scottish tours that would soon become a lucrative operation. He conveyed 350 wide-eyed Sassenachs by train and steamboat to Glasgow, and for customers travelling for the first time, he offered guidebooks such as Cook\u2019s Scottish Tourist Practical Directory \u2013 which had a chapter headed \u201cIs It Safe for Ladies to Join in Highland Tours?\u201d Within a decade, Cook was running continental trips: he personally conducted a trip from Harwich to Antwerp, Brussels, Cologne, Heidelberg and Strasbourg that ended up in Paris for the International Exhibition in 1855. The Leicester-based company became more ambitious, especially after Thomas\u2019s son John Mason Cook joined. In 1865 they open their first travel agency on Fleet Street in London and the following year Cook junior led its first trip to America. The world continued to shrink, and in 1873 Thomas Cook completed his first round-the-globe tour, marketed as \u201cLondon to London\u201d, for 200 guineas. About this time the firm became one of the first to use travellers\u2019 cheques: it called them \u201ccircular notes\u201d. John took over in 1879 and ran the firm until his death 20 years later, when his three sons inherited Thomas Cook &amp; Son. Its success continued into the 20th century as the skies opened up, with the company chalking up another first when it offered \u201cpleasure trips by air\u201d in 1919. In 1928 the family sold up to the Belgian owners of the Orient Express, but the second world war saw it become part of the nationalised British Railways. After the war, sales took off again with the era of package holidays. By 1950, more than a million Britons were travelling abroad each year, mainly to France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Thomas Cook returned to private ownership in 1972 and has seen a series of mergers and takeovers. In 2007, it merged with the UK-listed owner of Airtours, MyTravel Group, which nearly collapsed in 2011 but was bailed out by its banks. Now, 178 years on, in an industry its founder would not recognise, Thomas Cook may have come to the end of its journey.",

Every new year I make the same resolution: be kinder to yourself. I try to stay positive, but it never lasts. I\u2019ve been in therapy for a couple of years now, and I don\u2019t look at photos of me, or read what people say.</p> <p><strong>My mum made sure</strong> I always felt powerful. My parents were loving, encouraging my brother and me in everything we did \u2013 whether that was pursuing performing after seeing <em>Annie</em> on Broadway aged five, or spending hours rolling around in the front yard. By my teenage years I\u2019d grown despondent, I was ready to leave the small town I grew up in earlier than I could.</p> <p><strong>Make lists after break-ups</strong>, they focus your mind when you are pining or desperate. Mourning the end of a relationship is important, but so too is perspective. I write down all the things that didn\u2019t work as a reminder of the bad stuff; another with what I want from a future partner. Passionate flings are an antidote, too, who doesn\u2019t want an ego boost there and then?</p> <p><strong>Bernie Sanders is punk</strong> as fuck, plain and simple. I\u2019m petrified of the US government right now. We need someone radical to take Trump on, and Bernie\u2019s record as a senator speaks for itself. Honestly, at this stage, I\u2019ll campaign for whoever runs as a Democrat. We just have to get out and fight.</p> <p><strong>My father passed away</strong> when I was 20 and, to be honest, I\u2019m still figuring out how to deal with the loss. I have a picture of my dad in a necklace that I wear, and his initials on my keychain.</p> <p><strong>I was driving</strong> to a wedding in upstate New York a few weeks back and got pulled over by the cops for speeding. They ran my licence and found I had an outstanding warrant from 1991 that I had no recollection of. I could have been arrested, but the trooper let me off. I haven\u2019t driven since.</p> <p><strong>My garbage</strong> causes me a lot of anxiety. I look at how much trash I generate and it fills me with dread, and I end up flying a lot to work. It all just feels like total hypocrisy given we\u2019re on the verge of environmental catastrophe. I\u2019m working on it, though, but I wish I could be better.</p> <p><strong>Intimacy matters to me</strong> more than sex. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m a triple Scorpio, or that I was showered with so much affection as a child, but I always crave the physical touch. Performative sex is boring, for me it\u2019s all about feeling something, actually connecting. That\u2019s how I approach sex scenes: they only work if you trust your partner and together you can find some truth. </p> <p><em>Chlo\u00eb Sevigny\u2019s perfume Little Flower is available on <a href=\"https://regimedesfleurs.com/\" title=\"\">regimedesfleurs.com</a> and at <a href=\"https://www.doverstreetmarket.com/\" title=\"\">Dover Street Market</a> now</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "I come off cold or unapproachable, when in fact I\u2019m just insecure. I\u2019m hypercritical of how I look, how I act, how I come across in interviews. Every new year I make the same resolution: be kinder to yourself. I try to stay positive, but it never lasts. I\u2019ve been in therapy for a couple of years now, and I don\u2019t look at photos of me, or read what people say. My mum made sure I always felt powerful. My parents were loving, encouraging my brother and me in everything we did \u2013 whether that was pursuing performing after seeing Annie on Broadway aged five, or spending hours rolling around in the front yard. By my teenage years I\u2019d grown despondent, I was ready to leave the small town I grew up in earlier than I could. Make lists after break-ups, they focus your mind when you are pining or desperate. Mourning the end of a relationship is important, but so too is perspective. I write down all the things that didn\u2019t work as a reminder of the bad stuff; another with what I want from a future partner. Passionate flings are an antidote, too, who doesn\u2019t want an ego boost there and then? Bernie Sanders is punk as fuck, plain and simple. I\u2019m petrified of the US government right now. We need someone radical to take Trump on, and Bernie\u2019s record as a senator speaks for itself. Honestly, at this stage, I\u2019ll campaign for whoever runs as a Democrat. We just have to get out and fight. My father passed away when I was 20 and, to be honest, I\u2019m still figuring out how to deal with the loss. I have a picture of my dad in a necklace that I wear, and his initials on my keychain. I was driving to a wedding in upstate New York a few weeks back and got pulled over by the cops for speeding. They ran my licence and found I had an outstanding warrant from 1991 that I had no recollection of. I could have been arrested, but the trooper let me off. I haven\u2019t driven since. My garbage causes me a lot of anxiety. I look at how much trash I generate and it fills me with dread, and I end up flying a lot to work. It all just feels like total hypocrisy given we\u2019re on the verge of environmental catastrophe. I\u2019m working on it, though, but I wish I could be better. Intimacy matters to me more than sex. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m a triple Scorpio, or that I was showered with so much affection as a child, but I always crave the physical touch. Performative sex is boring, for me it\u2019s all about feeling something, actually connecting. That\u2019s how I approach sex scenes: they only work if you trust your partner and together you can find some truth.

They weren\u2019t.</p> <p>Those moves on their own, however, aren\u2019t quite enough to explain why things went so badly this season. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that Chris Sale \u2013 who has, at times, been the best pitcher in baseball during his career \u2013 reverted to a below-average starter after Dombrowski handed him a five-year, <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/chris-sale-contract-extension-with-red-sox\">$145m contract extension</a>. He went 6-11, his worst season, and his campaign was cut short with <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/chris-sale-contract-extension-with-red-sox\">an elbow injury</a>.</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t have hurt the team so much if it weren\u2019t for the fact that former Cy Young winners David Price and Rick Porcello both had down years at the same time. Eduardo Rodriguez, who is currently chasing a 20-win season, admirably stepped up to become their most reliable starter but it\u2019s not great when your ace-by-default has issues getting past the sixth inning and your team doesn\u2019t really have a functioning bullpen. When your pitching is this unreliable, it doesn\u2019t really matter that your offense features reigning AL MVP Mookie Betts and outstanding shortstop Xander Bogaerts. Meanwhile, the Sox are well over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_luxury_tax\">the luxury tax</a> threshold and they might have the <a href=\"https://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/article/47305/2019-prospects-organization-rankings/\">worst farm system in baseball</a>.</p> <p>Now, part of the team\u2019s failures has to do with <a href=\"https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/what-is-regression-to-the-mean/\">regression to the mean</a>.

But, few imagined the correction would be so extreme.</p> <p>Dombrowksi didn\u2019t do much to change the team\u2019s fortunes either. The only major move the Red Sox made before the trade deadline was dealing for Baltimore Orioles starter Andrew Cashner to try to bolster the leaky starting rotation. Cashner has been a below-average starter for the majority of his career despite having an uncharacteristically effective first half for the dreadful Baltimore Orioles. To absolutely nobody\u2019s surprise but the Sox, <a href=\"https://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/article/47305/2019-prospects-organization-rankings/\">Cashner immediately regressed</a> when playing for a would-be contender and he was promptly relegated to the bullpen despite the team being desperate for starters.</p> <p>Even for those who believed that Dombrowski deserved to be fired, there\u2019s no question that ownership <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2019/09/10/dave-dombrowski-fired-2\">went about it the wrong way</a>. They promptly ended his tenure after yet another painful loss to the Yankees, announcing the move by issuing a statement and then letting Cora and the players \u2013 all of whom were as stunned as anybody else \u2013 answer questions from the media.</p> <p>Now that the Red Sox season has come to a merciful end, it leaves behind an obvious question: is this the most embarrassing follow-up to a World Series win?

The then-Florida Marlins won the World Series in 1997 and then proceeded to tear apart the team roster in the first of several fire sales, something which permanently hurt their chances of gaining a true fanbase in south Florida. They at least waited an extra year after beating the Yankees in the 2003 World Series, only slashing their payroll in 2005. Rebranding as the Miami Marlins and hiring beloved former Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter were not enough to prevent them from sealing their fate as the cheapest and least-loved team in the MLB.</p> <p>Red Sox owner John Henry can\u2019t claim to be unaware of the Marlins\u2019 checkered history \u2013 he was their sole owner from 1999 to 2002.

Ownership \u201cparted ways\u201d with Dombrowski partly because they could no longer justify going well over the luxury tax for such meager returns in the standings.

Before Voysey built it, his only cottage hospital, the villagers in the 13 surrounding rural parishes who fell ill had to travel all the way to Exeter or Okehampton.\u201d From next year, not only will a third of the old hospital be restored for continued use as a community health resource, but each year the remainder will be offered out at no cost for selected dates, along with some of the trust\u2019s other buildings, as a place for those in need, including bereaved children, traumatised veterans and carers, to come and recuperate. The scheme, called 50 for Free, has been running for five years and was inspired by the way that visitors to the trust\u2019s buildings commented on how their mood was boosted by a stay in an ancient place, or unusual historic venue, away from the trappings of modern life. Applications for the next charitable visits open next month. English Heritage and Historic England, two of Britain\u2019s other major heritage and conservation charities, are also exploring the therapeutic side of their properties. English Heritage has set up days for people living with mental health problems and on low incomes at Stonehenge, a site it maintains jointly with the National Trust. Human Henge events focus on the site\u2019s strong associations with natural healing and contemplation, much as the Japanese therapy of shinrin-yoku, or forest bathing, is now being prescribed by some doctors treating depression. Historic England has also found that visits to historic towns, ancient places of worship and archaeological sites have the same beneficial effects on blood pressure and general wellbeing as social sporting activity. Research by University College London five years ago was among the first to make the link between heritage sites and mental wellness. It showed that contact with a heritage site, whether as a visitor or a volunteer, frequently improved mood and even promoted a sense of citizenship among isolated and disadvantaged groups. And this weekend, at the culmination of the annual Heritage Open Days week, many of Britain\u2019s local authorities will be encouraging families to visit nearby museums, stately homes and historic sites as a healthy way to break the repetitive pattern of work, shopping and domestic chores. While a period of respite in a beautiful castle or folly would probably benefit anyone, Stanford believes that Winsford, offering a moment \u201cout of time\u201d, with no phone or television, was always destined to be a haven of peace and healing again. Now, as the last nails are hammered in by conservationists, it is a place of restoration in both senses of the word.",

What I really love, is what this NRL final between the Storm and the Eels might produce. Whichever way you look at it, one of these teams will be done and dusted after tonight.

      "bodyText": "Seven tries to nil tells the story and Melbourne put to bed their loss to Canberra to set up a tantalising preliminary final date against the Roosters. The Storm were on from the first second. Strange to say but for such a flogging the Eels weren\u2019t awful. They were simply given no chance by a rabid Storm outfit. Papenhuyzen, Vunivalu and Addo-Carr were immense, to name a few. The better team won, and won well, and Melbourne\u2019s clash with the Chooks can\u2019t come quick enough. Try! Melbourne 32-0 Parramatta Great try-saving tackle from Brown to deny Olam but that just frees up open spaces for the Storm and Asofa-Solomona uses brute strength to cross over and put some icing on the cake for Melbourne. 73 mins: A penalty to Melbourne and the zip is now out of this game. The Storm have eyes set on the Roosters, the Eels have eyes set on Trivago. Lovely kick almost sets Addo-Carr free but Ferguson is there to save the day. 68 mins: Parra win a penalty but they are making hard work of the territory battle and Melbourne regain possession. Ferguson is looking proppy after a clash of bodies but returns to the scrum. The Eels can\u2019t make any inroads and now Melbourne get a fresh set. 62 mins: Only 11 completed sets from the Eels. In a semi-final. Against the Storm. And now a stray pass from Ferguson hands possession back to Melbourne. Did I mention Parra were 26 points down? Try! Melbourne 26-0 Parramatta Ripping try from the Storm, working the ball out wide from the scrum and Papenhuyzen doing the rest courtesy of some acrobatics near the post. Training ground drill, that. Bouquets for Melbourne, but naive defending from the Eels. 55 mins: Vunivalu dumps Gutherson from a kick just inside the Parra half. The Eels No.1 is looking very groggy. Vinivalu has been huge tonight. Possession, though, is still with the Eels. They\u2019ve had more of the footy but the Storm are still winning the war. 53 mins: Oh-so-close for Ferguson, who flies high out wide but can\u2019t reel in the pass. They\u2019re getting closer, the Eels, but they need to get a hurry-on. Storm defending very well. 48 mins: Addo-Carr, the star, intercepts at the tail-end of an Eels set. Nothing going right for Parra. 44 mins: Parra start the second half a bit more conservatively, looking to at least complete a set or two, and they do gain some territory. But the Storm work their way back with relative ease before Scott knocks on and forces the scrum 30m out for the Eels. Nothing comes of it but that\u2019s better from Parra. And here\u2019s the Smith incident. The Storm are dominating all statistical measures, as you would imagine: Possession, completion, metres gained (754-361!!!!!), tackles, even their hairstyles look better. Mostly. Can\u2019t see a way back for Parra here. Barring something approaching a miracle, yet another preliminary final weekend will feature Melbourne. HT: Melbourne 22-0 Parramatta Parramatta a held scoreless for the first time in the first half of a final since the 2009 grand final (against Melbourne). An amazing first half from Melbourne. It had it all. Including a brain fade from Smith. 33 mins: Nice intercept from King repels a rare Eels charge. I don\u2019t want to harp on about this, but, 22-0 up, what was Smith thinking? 30 mins: The two No.9s come together and Smith is in the sin bin after clocking Mahoney in the face right in front of the ref. That is bizarre. Good agitation from the Eel, but what was Smith thinking? Try! Melbourne 22-0 Parramatta It\u2019s all Melbourne. Vunivalu owns Brown, earning the Storm a fresh set. From this something-from-nothing, Munster delivers a searching kick that looks to be dead but ends up in the hungry hands of Addo-Carr. That man has some gas. Very few wingers, very few players, could have made up that ground and timed his run to such perfection. Great try. 25 mins: The Eels finally toss the ball around a bit but just when they look threatening Sivo concedes a penalty, cleaning up Vunivalu with barely an eye on the ball. Advantage Melbourne. Try! Melbourne 18-0 Parramatta Melbourne have the Midas Touch tonight. Brilliant work from Vunivalu to keep the ball in play from a Hughes kick at the end of the set, leaving Hughes to follow up his own kick and cross for another try. And finally we have a conversion. This is one-way traffic. 19 mins: Parra finally get some good fortune, with the Eels getting a scrum feed 10m out thanks to a dog of a bounce that Bromwich couldn\u2019t drag in. Parra try to string some passes together before Blake fumbles and is dumped. Gutherson then cleans up the corner post with a kick that wasn\u2019t, um, meant for the corner post. The Eels are rattled. Try! Melbourne 12-0 Parramatta The Eels can\u2019t take a trick and cough the ball up 20m from the line, Smith with a deft left foot kick that ricochets off a leg before Munster pounces on the loose ball for the Storm\u2019s third try. But, jeepers creepers, Smith fails to convert again, this time from not far out from straight in front. He, after all, is human. Try! Melbourne 8-0 Parramatta Melbourne have had five of the first six sets and they have run galore out wide. The Eels give Melbourne way too much room, Jennings overcommits, and Vunivalu strolls over to make it two tries for the hosts - twice as many as they scored last week. Tight angle again for Cam Smith and he can\u2019t convert. But a scintillating start from the Storm. 9 mins: Melbourne are dominating possession and stringing passes together. But, wow, one way to stop that is with a shoulder charge. Huge, huge hit from Sivo on Papenhuyzen. Sivo\u2019s on report but not in the bin. Try! Melbourne 4-0 Parramatta Addo-Carr at his slick, swerving best, collects the ball from inside Parra\u2019s end before getting in the clear and tossing a dummy just before the line before crossing. Smith, from a tight angle, can\u2019t convert. But what magic from Addo-Carr. Like a knife through butter. 2 mins: Huge fend from Asofa-Solomona on Moses. Good pressure from Melbourne forces the turnover and they produce an excellent set that doesn\u2019t trouble the scorer but puts Parra on notice. We\u2019re almost under way. Weather is a bit dicey in Bleak City. It\u2019s a bit wet. Clean hands will be important. Strap yourselves in. OK, to recap today. The Wallabies were given heart palpitations by Fiji. Collingwood were given the sweats by GWS, then gave the Giants the hurry-up, before taking leave from this season by less than a kick. This NRL final has more angles than a fly-fishing tournament. I ask you this: will Melbourne bounce back or will Parramatta prove last week\u2019s landslide wasn\u2019t a flash in the pan? Team news: Eels unchanged but Curtis Scott to start with Will Chambers on the bench for the first time since Cam Smith was knee high to a grasshopper. Fair call? Evening, sports fans. Scott Heinrich here, reporting for duty. Thanks, first of all, goes to Geoff Lemon for racing back to Australia from the UK specifically to kick off this Sportwatch liveblog. Really commendable considering his plan was to spend a week in the Greek islands doing five-eighths of bugger all before he returned to this bronzed land. But the call came to kick off this blog and he answered the only way he knows how. That\u2019s how much he loves you guys. And I kind of love you, too, in a distant, platonic kind of way. What I really love, is what this NRL final between the Storm and the Eels might produce. Whichever way you look at it, one of these teams will be done and dusted after tonight. My Lord, what if it\u2019s Melbourne. Will the world end if they exit 2019 in straight sets? Righto, that\u2019s it for me. Next up it\u2019s the NRL, with the Storm taking on the Eels. Electricity on both fronts. Scott Heinrich will be your companion for that. If you want to follow the All Blacks and South Africa in the World Cup, we\u2019re running a separate live blog on that here. 30 disposals for Haynes the best on the day, 28 for Howe, 27 for Kelly. Cameron kicked three, two apiece for Stephenson, Thomas and Finlayson. A low-scoring fight in the wet. The battle between Grundy and Mumford was a highlight. Taranto was important out of the backline and kicked a goal. Adams was a livewire for Collingwood. Mihocek, Reid, Davis and Hill were among the least effective. Reid, Mayne and Adams all had chances for late important goals for the Pies but missed. It\u2019s another tough one for Collingwood, and a historic day for GWS. There\u2019s a big big sound in the west of the town \u2013 it\u2019s the sound of the mighty siren. It\u2019s over. The Giants hang on. For the first time in their history, the Giants will play off for a premiership. They\u2019ve won at the MCG tonight, and they could do it again in a week\u2019s time. Collingwood kicked three straight to start the match, then couldn\u2019t find a goal in a half of footy. GWS kicked seven in the meantime. Then Collingwood finally came back and kicked five in a row. They had no right to still be in it, really, but they found their fight at the end. A great finish to three quarters of a very dour match. Full time: Coll 7.10 (52) to GWS 8.8 (56) \u2013 The Giants hang on! Mumford was huge in that last minute (he\u2019s always huge, but you know what I mean). He clears the ball out of the goal square with a kick, and GWS wrestle it to the 50. Then it comes back in and Mumford is fighting at ground level, trying to lock it in. Wrestle after wrestle, a couple of ball-ups. Eventually Haynes gets a clearing kick. Collingwood bounce back in, to full forward. Need a mark, but it\u2019s spoiled! Haynes runs the ball towards the boundary! Clocks counts to zero! 4Q: 1 min remaining: Coll 7.9 (52) to GWS 8.8 (56) \u2013 Giants clear to the wing! Pies get back forward! Can they score? It\u2019s out of bounds at half-forward with a minute to go. 4Q: 3 mins remaining: Coll 7.9 (52) to GWS 8.8 (56) \u2013 How big is that Jeremy Cameron miss now? Collingwood within a goal. They stream forward again, Adams has been in everything, he kicks long and... hits the post! Four points, three minutes! 4Q: 5 mins remaining: Coll 7.8 (51) to GWS 8.8 (56) \u2013 A goal! But it isn\u2019t! The score review overrules on this occasion. Chris Mayne again, steaming out of the goalsquare to mark on the lead in heavy traffic. Goes back from 40, pokes at his set shot a bit, and after many replays the officials rule the goal was touched on the line. 4Q: 7mins remaining: Coll 7.8 (50) to GWS 8.8 (56) \u2013 Too much happening to relate! Mumford takes a ball out of the ruck and tries to scrub a goal, but it gets chopped off. Everyone is injured now. Bodies hitting the ground. Stephenson, was it, or Treloar? Off the ground through the middle, chips to his teammates\u2019 advantage. The ball gets forward, big fly, no mark, Giants defend, but eventually it comes to Josh Thomas. The unlikely star! Snaps his second for the night! One goal the difference. 4Q: 11mins remaining: Coll 6.8 (44) to GWS 8.8 (56) \u2013 Collingwood on fire! Ben Reid takes a huge pack mark 20 out from goal! The long kicks in have suddenly started to happen, and they\u2019re creating scoring chances. But Reid misses his set shot! Pushes it to the right. Had the chance to put the Pies within 7. Instead it\u2019s still 12 points the difference. 4Q: 12mins remaining: Coll 6.7 (43) to GWS 8.8 (56) \u2013 Miracle goal! Chris Mayne! He earns a lot of money for playing not a lot of games, but he\u2019s earned his cheque tonight! Again the long kick is spoiled, one attempted soccer is smothered, the ball is surely going to be punched over, but Mayne arrives with a toe! From a crazy angle! And slots it off the ground! 4Q: 13mins remaining: Coll 5.7 (37) to GWS 8.8 (56) \u2013 Another driving ball to the teeth of Collingwood\u2019s goal, and it\u2019s punched over by the Giants\u2019 defence. One more point. The difference is 19. 4Q: 14mins remaining: Coll 5.6 (36) to GWS 8.8 (56) \u2013 Two in a row for Collingwood! Quick movement forward, into a pack, Taylor Adams scrambling the snap, and it\u2019s through! Survives a score review for being touched. Collingwood still in it. 4Q: 15mins remaining: Coll 4.6 (30) to GWS 8.8 (56) \u2013 Stephenson goals for Collingwood! Any life in the Pies yet? A short pass just inside 50, and the tipster is on the lead up towards the arc. He goes back to shoot and makes sweet contact. 4Q: 16mins remaining: Coll 3.6 (24) to GWS 8.8 (56) \u2013 Hill marks in the centre of the ground, kicks forward for Cameron to mark just inside 50. This time his set shot floats wide. Collingwood clear their defence. Mihocek gets his first kick of the night running through the centre, on to Elliott, but his shot at goal misses. Collingwood started with three goals straight, but just eight points since the second quarter. 4Q: 17 mins remaining: Coll 3.5 (23) to GWS 8.7 (55) \u2013 Jeremy Cameron! What a player! A mass of players, a free kick for him on the forward flank. Just inside 50, on the right-hand side of the forward line. It\u2019s a tough kick, 50 metres on the angle, but he nails it! Bends it home! 4Q: 18 mins remaining: Coll 3.5 (23) to GWS 7.7 (49) \u2013 Last chance saloon for Collingwood. The ball is bounced. Grundy rucks, Mumford roves! The GWS ruckman stays down and takes the tap. GWS make a couple of forward forays immediately. Three-quarter time: Coll 3.5 (23) to GWS 7.7 (49) \u2013 A mark just before the siren for Noble, who kicks from just outside 50. But going for the distance sees him push his kick wide to the left after the siren. No team-lifting goal for the Pies. 3Q: 2 mins remaining: Coll 3.4 (22) to GWS 7.7 (49) \u2013 A free goal for GWS! Everyone sweeps up the ground, except Cameron stays at home. Another Collingwood turnover in midfield, fast movement back, and Cameron is all on his own! Goes back and slots the set shot for the team\u2019s seventh. It\u2019s out to 27 points. 3Q: 3 mins remaining: Coll 3.4 (22) to GWS 6.7 (43) \u2013 This is so, so scrappy. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve seen more than two disposals in a row hit a target. Maybe we haven\u2019t even seen two. Stephenson has made a lot of blues for Collingwood. Heath Shaw is desperate in contest after contest. Eventually Collingwood break clear, Crisp fires from outside 50 and kicks a point. 3Q: 5 mins remaining: Coll 3.3 (21) to GWS 6.7 (43) \u2013 At the bottom of a pack on the GWS forward flank, Bobby Hill traps the ball between his ankles to keep it in, but not be done for holding the ball. That\u2019s an elite ankle move. 3Q: 8 mins remaining: Coll 3.3 (21) to GWS 6.7 (43) \u2013 Almost some good moves from the Pies up forward, but the marks don\u2019t quite stick and the pick-ups don\u2019t quite pick up. GWS players are in everyone\u2019s pocket. Josh Thomas gets a hurried snap away but it hits the post, and so does Heath Shaw with his face while trying to mark the ball. 3Q: 10 mins remaining: Coll 3.2 (20) to GWS 6.7 (43) \u2013 It could have been five in a row, with a soft 50-metre penalty as Tomlinson is pushed after receiving a free kick. But he misses his set shot from 40. Ball back into the Giants forward line immediately from the kick-in. Collingwood can\u2019t get away. All the players are appealing for deliberate out of bounds but it isn\u2019t given. A second throw-in follows the first. Grundy! Gets monstered! Shoved out of the ruck contest by Mumford, who grabs the ball first pluck, and check-sides a goal! That was a push in the back, probably. Mumford was trying to push him in the side but it wasn\u2019t a subtle move. Still, you can\u2019t score review for a potential free kick. The rain is coming down again, and it\u2019s a long time since Collingwood scored. 3Q: 13 mins remaining: Coll 3.2 (20) to GWS 5.6 (36) \u2013 Four in a row for GWS! In this game that\u2019s a big lead. Rooty Hill will be pumping! Penrith will be electric! Throw-in in the forward pocket, Finlayson tips it over the back, and Taranto is lurking to run onto that ball and dribble a goal! 3Q: 15 mins remaining: Coll 3.2 (20) to GWS 4.6 (30) \u2013 Another goal for the Giants! A bunch of pressure acts along the 50 arc in the GWS forward line, fights and drops and snaps and ricochets, and finally one clean brushstroke among the Jackson Pollock \u2013 it\u2019s Zac Williams who picks up the loose ball and slots it home from 40! 3Q: 17 mins remaining: Coll 3.2 (20) to GWS 3.6 (24) \u2013 Away in the third quarter. Quickly forward to the Giants\u2019 end, and Finlayson has a long high shot at goal that drifts wide on the air currents way up there. They\u2019ve got a goal the hard way, in the form of six behinds. The ball goes down to defence, but there\u2019s a good relieving mark. Back they come up the wing. Hill has had a quiet day in for Greene, but manages to trap the ball against the paint and get a handball away to Hopper. It ends up with Daniels, who snaps from the left forward pocket and goals! Giants in front! NRLW: Brisbane Women are leading Sydney Roosters Women 16-0 with a few minutes to go. My colleague Adam Collins has sent an email about the toss. \u201cIt mattered quite a bit in the 1987 prelim when Tuck\u2019s decision essentially meant that Hawthorn kicked with the wind for three quarters!\u201d He does things like this. Half-time: Coll 3.2 (20) to GWS 2.5 (17) \u2013 There\u2019s the break, and thank heavens for that. What an drudge of a display. It started hammering down rain in Melbourne in the last little while. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrific game,\u201d says Paul Roos, who loved coaching Sydney to wins where they only kicked two goals. It is not a terrific game, Paul. It is decidedly unterrific. No one can pick up the ball. No one even tried in that last few minutes. And the one method of opening up the play in these conditions \u2013 the free kick \u2013 has been abandoned by the umpires. The league should just give Richmond the cup now on moral grounds alone. Q2: 1 min remaining: Coll 3.2 (20) to GWS 2.5 (17) \u2013 How is that not a free kick? Hoskin-Elliott is being manhandled by Haynes, and never took possession of the ball but is held off it obviously on the half-forward flank. The umpires are letting anyone do anything at the moment. GWS go forward, switch play, but Collingwood\u2019s defence comes right back out again. Q2: 4 mins remaining: Coll 3.2 (20) to GWS 2.5 (17) \u2013 Goal! Pendlebury with one of his classic snaps in traffic. And you can mark half of that goal down to Brodie Grundy. The Giants were about to get a clearance, but Grundy lying on the ground shoots his arms out from under the pack and grabs the ball, rips it away, gets it clear. But we\u2019ve had a score review now, and the ball was touched! Off the boot. Just got a finger from... I think it was Kelly? Q2: 6 mins remaining: Coll 3.1 (19) to GWS 2.5 (17) \u2013 Callum Brown! Has a fresh air shot from off the deck, 10 metres out from goal. Runs over it completely, after the ball spilled from a dangerous centring ball from Tom Phillips. Ball stays inside 50 for Collingwood. Reid drops a mark, a couple of throws go unpunished from either team. Adams snaps and misses. This is... not good football, ladies and gents. Q2: 10 mins remaining: Coll 3.0 (18) to GWS 2.5 (17) \u2013 The Giants just can\u2019t get through half-forward. They\u2019ve had the bulk of the possession but can\u2019t find a path. Reid gets a free kick on the half-back flank and moves Collingwood the other way. There\u2019s a run through the middle of the ground, then a switch of play to the right forward flank. Inside 50 in the middle, Adams fighting at ground level, but the Giants lock it up. They win it back, run the length of the ground, and Cameron is running onto the loose ball inside 50 but gets scragged by Darcy Moore all the way back, and can only soccer a behind. Could have been about three free kicks there. One point the difference. Q2: 14 mins remaining: Coll 3.0 (18) to GWS 2.4 (16) \u2013 Goal for GWS! They finally find a way through. Cameron leads into the pocket, the lead is honoured, and he marks on an angle to kick from 40 out. No problem for the left-footer from the right pocket. Q2: 16 mins remaining: Coll 3.0 (18) to GWS 1.4 (10) \u2013 The Giants nearly find their second, but desperate defending from Collingwood sees Hill tackled in the goal square as he tries to snap in dense traffic, and the kick skews wide. It all started with Taranto\u2019s hard work in defence, then a couple of tough contests on the wing. Finally GWS get forward with a chain of handballs under immense pressure, but Collingwood hang on. Q2: 18 mins remaining: Coll 3.0 (18) to GWS 1.3 (9) \u2013 Second quarter is away. GWS with the early movement forward, but Howe again wins the free for being infringed in the marking contest. Collingwood get the quick transition, up the flank on the Members side of the ground, into the forward line and Ben Reid uses his strength to protect the drop, then leaps forward to mark in front of the goal square. Goal! Slots it from 15 out. Quarter time: Coll 2.0 (12) to GWS 1.3 (9) \u2013 A handsome long kick from Lloyd with 20 seconds left, from a set shot outside 50. But it fades right just at the end of its run, and misses for a point. A tight first quarter, scrappy and with finals intensity. The game might open up a bit now that the early exchanges are done. Q1: 1 mins remaining: Coll 2.0 (12) to GWS 1.2 (8) \u2013 Ian Hill marks hard on the boundary line in the forward pocket, but Jeremy Howe is given a free kick. Goes long up the wing, then the ball comes back, and Howe comes flying above the pack to punch it 40 metres forward. A better spoiler than the one on any Commodore. Pies lose possession again, and back it comes to Hill\u2019s advantage again, marking deep in the pocket. But he shanks the kick to the right, out on the full. Q1: 3 mins remaining: Coll 2.0 (12) to GWS 1.2 (8) \u2013 Another long point for GWS, rolling through and escorted at the last second from Lloyd\u2019s kick. Q1: 5 mins remaining: Coll 2.0 (12) to GWS 1.1 (7) \u2013 Stephenson takes the lead back for the Pies! Fast movement through the centre, a fumble at centre-half forward as Stephenson tackles, chases up the loose ball, gathers, runs to 30 and snaps truly. Great individual goal, and shepherded through well by Elliott. Q1: 7 mins remaining: Coll 1.0 (6) to GWS 1.1 (7) \u2013 Finally a clear shot on goal. Jeremy Cameron traps the ball by the boundary line on the forward flank. Centres to Finlayson, who kicks from 50 and slots the goal! Q1: 9 mins remaining: Coll 1.0 (6) to GWS 0.1 (1) \u2013 Mumford should be having a shot from inside 50 but he spills the chest mark. Collingwood rebound with dash and pace all the way to their forward line, but some desperate last-line defending from the Giants makes space to run the ball out. Back to centre wing, which is where we all live now. Q1: 10 mins remaining: Coll 1.0 (6) to GWS 0.1 (1) \u2013 Stephenson to Elliott on the flank, but his kick inside 50 is touched off the boot. Mihocek tries to run through a pack but is brought down. Should be holding the ball but it isn\u2019t paid. The ball gets over the boundary from the bounce. Q1: 11 mins remaining: Coll 1.0 (6) to GWS 0.1 (1) \u2013 Lots of back and forth on the wing, but very little clean possession. A few throw-ins. Q1: 13 mins remaining: Coll 1.0 (6) to GWS 0.1 (1) \u2013 Mumford on centre wing gets a massive punch forward from a throw-in, but with more high-tempo footy, the ball is eventually kicked back under the pack it just came out of. Grundy is working well at ground level, his agility his advantage. But Collingwood turn it over with a throw. Heath Shaw wide to Haynes, up to forward 50, but Daniels, the hero of last week, can\u2019t handle the footy. No one wants possession, it\u2019s too hard to hold onto the ball. Q1: 15 mins remaining: Coll 1.0 (6) to GWS 0.1 (1) \u2013 Lots of hard tackling by Collingwood around the GWS half-back line. Eventually there\u2019s a free kick for Mumford, advantage paid as Hopper takes a flying shot at goal but misses to the left from 50. Q1: 16 mins remaining: Coll 1.0 (6) to GWS 0.0 (0) \u2013 Nick Haynes for the Giants goes up for a flyer at half-back but misjudges it and has landed on his head and neck. He gets up eventually but looks the worse for wear. Q1: 18 mins remaining: Coll 1.0 (6) to GWS 0.0 (0) \u2013 Holding the man paid to Grundy against Mumford, but his kick into the forward line is pulled back for taking it too early. He tries again, but Taranto cuts it off with a intercept mark. Giants get to half-forward, but eventually it comes back on a stream of passes, the last of them into the Collingwood forward pocket where Jamie Elliott marks. He converts with a kick sliding left to right, but sneaking in by the near post. Anthems have been sung, Collingwood have won the toss (I think? who cares about the toss in football?) and several of the various sirens have gone. Let\u2019s go. Some big outs for both sides: Jordan de Goey (hamstring) and Levi Greenwood (knee) for Collingwood, Lachie Whitfield (appendix) and Toby Greene (stupidity) for GWS.

Reid Jacob Hopper Adam Tomlinson Harry Himmelberg Daniel Lloyd Adam Kennedy Here\u2019s the classic and best version of the GWS song. For the neutral, there is only one option to support. We need a Richmond-GWS grand final purely so we can have the two best club songs on the day. Everyone knows the Tigerland / yellow &amp; black bit, and you can be jaded about it but it\u2019s a classic for a reason. Fewer people appreciate the Moscow Olympics / brass-band bombast of the Giants, the most upbeat and hearty tune of them all. Here is the definitive ranking of the best AFL club songs: 1: GWS 2: Richmond 3: Sydney That is all. All the rest are awful. Welcome to Sportwatch. Cricket season in England is just finishing, and cricket season in Australia is about to begin, but this week is all about football. We\u2019ll check on the rugby league and the Rugby World Cup as we go, and throw to the Storm v Eels game when we\u2019re done, but for the next couple of hours it\u2019s going to be the AFL preliminary final between Collingwood and Greater Western Sydney.",

The days following last weekend\u2019s attacks on Saudi oil facilities, blamed by the US on Iran, have seen an almost comical display of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/19/us-dials-back-iran-rhetoric-and-seeks-peaceful-resolution-over-saudi-attack\" title=\"\">indecision, confusion and bluster</a> by the leader of the world\u2019s most powerful country. As a result, Iran looks stronger \u2026 and Donald Trump looks like a clown. </p> <p>If Iranian leaders intended to call Trump\u2019s bluff, they have succeeded \u2013 for now at least. The president\u2019s immediate reaction to the attacks was to declare the US \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/16/trump-says-us-locked-and-loaded-after-saudi-arabia-oil-attack-as-crude-prices-soar-iran-aramco\" title=\"\">locked and loaded</a>\u201d for retaliatory strikes. Then he remembered he\u2019s opposed to fighting wars in the Middle East and hopes to be re-elected next year.</p> <p>Trump switched tack, saying the attacks were no big deal, even as global oil prices rocketed, because the US <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-attacks-trump/trump-says-u-s-does-not-need-middle-east-oil-but-cargoes-keep-coming-idUSKBN1W12RO\" title=\"\">no longer needed</a> Middle East energy. That\u2019s not strictly true. Official figures show the US imported 48 million barrels of oil and petroleum products a month from the Gulf in 2018. Still dodging and weaving, he said what happened next was up to the Saudis \u2013 an extraordinary outsourcing of national security policy.</p> <p>Trump ended the week still trying to have it both ways. He imposed additional sanctions on Iran and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/20/us-troops-saudia-arabia-iran-oil-industry-attack\" title=\"\">ordered a limited number of troops</a> to Saudi Arabia and the UAE for defensive purposes. But he did not rule out talks with Iran\u2019s president at the UN this week \u2013 despite the US <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/iran-bicker-visa-rouhani-hints-skipping-meeting-190919035017873.html\" title=\"\">denial of visas</a> to many of his officials. </p> <p>It had become painfully clear Trump simply had no idea what to do. With his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Tehran backfiring and his bellicose threats ringing hollow, he is the emperor with no clothes, the president who speaks loudly and fears to wield the big stick. Trump, plainly, has no strategy, no back-up plan \u2013 and no clue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/how-did-attack-breach-saudi-defences-and-what-will-happen-next\">How did oil attack breach Saudi defences and what will happen next?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This White House farce, which included the appointment of uber-hawk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/18/robert-o-brien-us-national-security-adviser\" title=\"\">Robert O\u2019Brien</a> to replace uber-hawk John Bolton as national security adviser, is of course no laughing matter. Trump could start firing off missiles at any moment. His unpredictability is part of the problem. The Iranians, emboldened, could overplay their hand. Another perceived provocation could jerk the meter back towards war. </p> <p>Yet this latest phase of the Iran crisis does have an upside. By supplying a much-needed reality check, it has driven home to all concerned the disastrous consequences a new, multi-dimensional Gulf war could have for international security and the global economy. And it has exposed Trump\u2019s failure to think through his bid to force Iran to its political and economic knees.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Another hard truth is that Iran is proving a tougher nut to crack than hawks such as Bolton ever imagined</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One such newly illuminated hard truth is the very limited nature of US military options. Military analysts say missile strikes, or a naval blockade of Iranian ports, would invite devastating retaliation. After the Iraq experience, ground troops are out of the question. And attacks on Iranian allies such as Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah would risk drawing Israel into an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/01/israel-anti-tank-missiles-fired-from-lebanon-military-says\" title=\"\">expanding regional conflict</a>. Although it has drawn up a <a href=\"https://geopoliticalfutures.com/us-military-options-in-iran/\" title=\"\">target list</a>, the Pentagon cautioned Trump last week against taking precipitate action. </p> <p>Another hard truth is that Iran is proving a tougher nut to crack than hawks such as Bolton ever imagined. The oilfield attacks, using drones and cruise missiles, demonstrated considerable military daring and technical expertise. Embarrassingly, they bamboozled the Saudis\u2019 expensive <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-security/costly-saudi-defenses-prove-no-match-for-drones-cruise-missiles-idUSKBN1W22FR\" title=\"\">US-supplied Patriot missile defences and early-warning systems</a>. </p> <p>Abandoning its policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d after enduring a year of punitive oil and financial sanctions, Iran has shifted to a twin-track strategy, slowly resuming prohibited nuclear activities while disrupting global energy supplies, for example by targeting Gulf tankers. So far, despite all Trump\u2019s ranting, Tehran has paid zero military price.

      "bodyText": "They must be laughing their socks off in Tehran. The days following last weekend\u2019s attacks on Saudi oil facilities, blamed by the US on Iran, have seen an almost comical display of indecision, confusion and bluster by the leader of the world\u2019s most powerful country. As a result, Iran looks stronger \u2026 and Donald Trump looks like a clown. If Iranian leaders intended to call Trump\u2019s bluff, they have succeeded \u2013 for now at least. The president\u2019s immediate reaction to the attacks was to declare the US \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for retaliatory strikes. Then he remembered he\u2019s opposed to fighting wars in the Middle East and hopes to be re-elected next year. Trump switched tack, saying the attacks were no big deal, even as global oil prices rocketed, because the US no longer needed Middle East energy. That\u2019s not strictly true. Official figures show the US imported 48 million barrels of oil and petroleum products a month from the Gulf in 2018. Still dodging and weaving, he said what happened next was up to the Saudis \u2013 an extraordinary outsourcing of national security policy. Trump ended the week still trying to have it both ways. He imposed additional sanctions on Iran and ordered a limited number of troops to Saudi Arabia and the UAE for defensive purposes. But he did not rule out talks with Iran\u2019s president at the UN this week \u2013 despite the US denial of visas to many of his officials. It had become painfully clear Trump simply had no idea what to do. With his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Tehran backfiring and his bellicose threats ringing hollow, he is the emperor with no clothes, the president who speaks loudly and fears to wield the big stick. Trump, plainly, has no strategy, no back-up plan \u2013 and no clue. This White House farce, which included the appointment of uber-hawk Robert O\u2019Brien to replace uber-hawk John Bolton as national security adviser, is of course no laughing matter. Trump could start firing off missiles at any moment. His unpredictability is part of the problem. The Iranians, emboldened, could overplay their hand. Another perceived provocation could jerk the meter back towards war. Yet this latest phase of the Iran crisis does have an upside. By supplying a much-needed reality check, it has driven home to all concerned the disastrous consequences a new, multi-dimensional Gulf war could have for international security and the global economy. And it has exposed Trump\u2019s failure to think through his bid to force Iran to its political and economic knees. One such newly illuminated hard truth is the very limited nature of US military options. Military analysts say missile strikes, or a naval blockade of Iranian ports, would invite devastating retaliation. After the Iraq experience, ground troops are out of the question. And attacks on Iranian allies such as Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah would risk drawing Israel into an expanding regional conflict. Although it has drawn up a target list, the Pentagon cautioned Trump last week against taking precipitate action. Another hard truth is that Iran is proving a tougher nut to crack than hawks such as Bolton ever imagined. The oilfield attacks, using drones and cruise missiles, demonstrated considerable military daring and technical expertise. Embarrassingly, they bamboozled the Saudis\u2019 expensive US-supplied Patriot missile defences and early-warning systems. Abandoning its policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d after enduring a year of punitive oil and financial sanctions, Iran has shifted to a twin-track strategy, slowly resuming prohibited nuclear activities while disrupting global energy supplies, for example by targeting Gulf tankers. So far, despite all Trump\u2019s ranting, Tehran has paid zero military price. Meanwhile, it has flatly denied responsibility for the Saudi attacks in a formal note sent to Washington. Diplomatically speaking, too, Iran is ahead. European governments supportive of the nuclear agreement rejected by Trump last year blame aggressive US policy for the current escalation. Britain does not say so in public, but Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, is not so timid. \u201cThe deal to stop Iran acquiring military nuclear capabilities is a building block we need to get back to,\u201d she said last week. This lack of a united front is damaging, as Trump may belatedly be realising. Inverting \u201cAmerica first\u201d unilateralist rhetoric, he has ordered his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to try to assemble an anti-Iran \u201cinternational coalition\u201d. Suddenly Trump\u2019s problem was the \u201cworld\u2019s problem\u201d. Pompeo is now saying the US seeks a \u201cpeaceful resolution\u201d and is stressing non-military means to \u201cmitigate\u201d the crisis. Like the US plan for joint Gulf naval patrols, the idea of an American-led coalition has few takers \u2013 partly because US policy is so obviously wrong-headed. But doubts about Trump\u2019s trustworthiness are also a factor. US claims in 2003 about Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction turned out to be false. Many Europeans will question the credibility of accusations made against Iran by a proven serial liar. These doubts are shared by Saudi leaders, who reportedly do not wholly trust Trump to back them if war breaks out.

For many, however, Mirfin says, heading into pubs and hotels is unpractical and expensive. \u201cI\u2019m pretty annoyed about it, with what farmers do, we\u2019re on a tight schedule; we can\u2019t just drop everything and go to the pub even if its going to be on there. It\u2019s a pretty awkward situation all around.\u201d Mike Connors, the CEO of the West Coast Rugby Union Club, said many people did not like going to pubs to watch games as alcohol could make things rowdy and the sound and quality of the experience often was not up to scratch. \u201cMost of New Zealand is a pretty rural farming country, so this is a pretty strange decision,\u201d Connors said. \u201cSome people just won\u2019t be able to watch, there are no contingencies in place. \u201cIf you live 150km from a town, are you going to drive in to watch it? Personally I don\u2019t even like the atmosphere at bars. A lot of people are the same.\u201d TV and audiovisual experts nationwide have also reported a boom in business as they guide people through installing the tricky technology. As the All Blacks ran out to meet the Springboks on Saturday, delays and freezing interrupted the lead-up. For some viewers, the live stream froze for more than 20 seconds and only went live again as George Bridge of the All Blacks scored the first try of the match. Earlier in the evening, more than 88,000 New Zealanders had tuned in to watch the Fiji vs Australia match, with over 10% reporting problems. A spokesperson for Spark told the Guardian there had been \u201cno issues reported\u201d in the lead-up to the All Blacks\u2019 kick-off on Saturday, despite evidence of numerous live complaints to the company on social media, and reports of issues with games and pre-game commentary, freezing, displaying error messages and flicking to black. \u201cIn terms of performance of our platform, we have no issues from our end,\u201d a Spark spokesperson said. \u201cOur customer care teams are working with customers who are experiencing user-related or device issues on an individual basis.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a decade and a half since <a href=\"http://www.teodor-currentzis.com/\" title=\"\">Teodor Currentzis </a>promised to save classical music. He was a young newcomer, his evangelism raw and provocative. The Greek-born, Russian-based conductor (b1972)is now mid-career, his fervour if anything more audacious. Last week he and his period-instrument ensemble, <strong>MusicAeterna</strong>, provided a triumphant finale to the 2019 Lucerne summer festival by performing all three Mozart/Da Ponte operas (<em>Le nozze di Figaro</em>, <em>Don Giovanni</em>, <em>Cos\u00ec fan tutte</em>) in concert stagings, with the mezzo-soprano <a href=\"https://www.ceciliabartoli.com/\" title=\"\">Cecilia Bartoli</a> a star attraction. You could hear the audience\u2019s intake of breath as Currentzis beetled into the overture to <em>Figaro </em>at cartoon car-chase velocity. And what was that thumping? Ah yes, the sound of his boot heels rhythmically landing on the podium. His jump-squat conducting style is in a class of its own.</p> <p>More familiar on the European festival circuit, notably Salzburg, Currentzis has hardly been seen in the UK. Last year he and his musicians \u2013 previously state-funded and resident in Perm, near the Urals, now independent and based in St Petersburg \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ec3d2m/play/ajzcv2/p06kf1w4\" title=\"\">gave a BBC Prom</a>.

The <em>New York Times</em> carried a feature in anticipation, with the headline: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/arts/music/teodor-currentzis-shed-verdi-requiem.html\" title=\"\">Saviour or Charlatan?</a>\u201d This gives the Currentzis flavour.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He directs every note, waving his hands right in the faces of the singers, though he refrained with Cecilia Bartoli</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Currentzis and MusicAeterna have already recorded the <a href=\"https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/8363454--mozart-da-ponte-cycle\" title=\"\">Da Ponte cycle</a>. I found the discs a struggle to get through and put them aside. Speeds now breakneck, now almost becalmed, the fussy ornamentation and idiosyncratic accentuation don\u2019t easily bear repeat listening. Yet these were precisely the qualities that gave the Lucerne festival concerts their compelling energy and fire. You have to be there. CD sales aside, this is what Currentzis would want. Repetition is anathema to him. This conductor demands the maximum from his musicians. Rehearsals are reported to go on late into the night, regardless of the union rules other orchestras abide by. The exhaustive attention to detail that results \u2013 the hair-raising, fleet-fingered string playing; the mellow woodwind, raspy brass and abrupt, percussive (rather than resonant) timpani \u2013 adds up to an experience that is arresting, often vulgar and irritating, but affecting.</p> <p>Much of the singing, Bartoli and some of the main soloists aside, was unexceptional, but the sense of ensemble and risk compensated. The chorus was magnificent, the orchestral playing breathtaking. Currentzis\u2019s youthful musicians, taking only the briefest of pauses, are on their feet throughout. The continuo players, who accompany the recitatives, improvise and decorate roughly twice as much as usual. Snatches of the Nokia theme, and a Bach violin partita, crept into the fortepiano flourishes. Why not? Mozart would have adored the zest of their <em>Figaro</em>, the Bacchanalian madness of <em>Don Giovanni</em> \u2013 which ended with the Don in hell, forgoing the final ensemble \u2013 and the erotic temerity of <em>Cos\u00ec fan tutte</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c4f0eb91fd6ac4fde21de3905856448248b0221\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c4f0eb91fd6ac4fde21de3905856448248b0221/0_0_3543_2346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cecilia Bartoli with Teodor Currentzis and MusicAeterna in Lucerne, 13 September 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cecilia Bartoli with Teodor Currentzis and MusicAeterna in Lucerne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Fischl</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Currentzis\u2019s approach is old-style authoritarian. He directs every note and phrase, waving his hands right in the faces of the singers, though he refrained with Bartoli in this, their stage debut together. As well as a concert of Mozart arias, she sang Despina, in <em>Cos\u00ec</em>, a role she first played in 1996. Currentzis may reckon she knows how it goes. Sparky, spiky, witty and brilliant, she in turn seemed to have no objection to Currentzis\u2019s more extreme tempi. At the same time, she centred the performance with her impeccable musical intelligence and style. It was the most successful of the three operas.</p> <p>With too many cast members to name, special praise to Irish mezzo-soprano <a href=\"http://www.paulamurrihy.com/www.paulamurrihy.com/Intro.html\" title=\"\">Paula Murrihy</a> (Cherubino/Dorabella) and Federica Lombardi (Donna Elvira). The Greek baritone Dimitris Tiliakos and American bass-baritone Kyle Ketelsen were well matched as Don Giovanni and Leporello, with the veteran British bass Robert Lloyd making a welcome appearance as the Commendatore. To fit in with Bartoli\u2019s schedule, Currentzis broke his usual rule and conducted four concerts in a row. Lucerne festival audiences benefited. The SWR Symphony Orchestra in Stuttgart, where he recently became chief conductor, paid the price. A day later he cancelled his concerts there for September. Maddening though he may be, Currentzis is neither saviour nor charlatan. The truth is more subtle and more interesting.</p> <p>We may feel his influence at the Royal Opera House\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/15/joyce-didonato-interview-agrippina-royal-opera-house\" title=\"\">new </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/15/joyce-didonato-interview-agrippina-royal-opera-house\" title=\"\">Agrippina</a></em> next week, conducted by Maxim Emelyanychev. The young Russian (newly appointed music director of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra) spent time as Currentzis\u2019s harpsichordist in Perm, and shares a similarly incisive, if less reckless, verve. The ROH season began last week with two revivals, <em><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/don-giovanni-by-kasper-holten\" title=\"\">Don Giovanni</a></em> \u2013 live in cinemas <a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/showings/don-giovanni-live-2019\" title=\"\">on 8 October</a> \u2013 and Massenet\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/werther-by-benoit-jacquot\" title=\"\">Werther</a></strong>, the third return of Beno\u00eet Jacquot\u2019s 2004 production, with designs by Charles Edwards that grow more austere and elegant as the tragedy darkens. Edward Gardner, conducting, allowed the ROH orchestra free rein in the brass-heavy, doom-laden fortissimos. There was delicacy too: the strings, in the passage accompanying Werther\u2019s letter about the grey winter sky, achieved a silvery eeriness.</p> <p>The Peruvian tenor <a href=\"https://www.juandiegoflorez.com/\" title=\"\">Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez</a>, tackling a vocally weightier part than usual, sang the title role. He isn\u2019t a nuanced actor but conveyed this romantic hero\u2019s relentless, lovelorn depression effectively, his voice true and passionate, almost always cutting through the orchestral outbursts. The American mezzo-soprano <a href=\"https://isabelleonard.com/\" title=\"\">Isabel Leonard</a> made a striking ROH debut as Charlotte, resolute, convincing, entrancing. Albert, her dull husband, was awarded unusual depth by the South African baritone <a href=\"https://www.intermusica.co.uk/artist/Jacques-Imbrailo\" title=\"\">Jacques Imbr</a><a href=\"https://www.intermusica.co.uk/artist/Jacques-Imbrailo\" title=\"\">ailo</a>, who can make standing stock-still look interesting. <a href=\"https://www.heatherengebretson.com/\" title=\"\">Heather Engebretson</a> (Sophie) and <a href=\"https://www.michaelmofidian.com/\" title=\"\">Michael Mofidian</a> (Johann) gave classy support. As long operatic deaths go, Werther\u2019s is epic. How Charlotte managed not to splash blood on her ivory dress, and what happened when she got home, are questions we can only ponder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"51e48d96adeb983455130d809b07cca0a0cb5552\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51e48d96adeb983455130d809b07cca0a0cb5552/2232_2439_1936_1161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez and Isabel Leonard in Werther at the Royal Opera House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez and Isabel Leonard in Werther at the Royal Opera House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Ashmore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Star ratings (out of five) <br>MusicAeterna/Currentzis </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<em><br>Werther </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/werther-by-benoit-jacquot\">Werther</a> continues at the Royal Opera House, London, until 5 October</p></li> </ul>",

The exhaustive attention to detail that results \u2013 the hair-raising, fleet-fingered string playing; the mellow woodwind, raspy brass and abrupt, percussive (rather than resonant) timpani \u2013 adds up to an experience that is arresting, often vulgar and irritating, but affecting. Much of the singing, Bartoli and some of the main soloists aside, was unexceptional, but the sense of ensemble and risk compensated. The chorus was magnificent, the orchestral playing breathtaking. Currentzis\u2019s youthful musicians, taking only the briefest of pauses, are on their feet throughout. The continuo players, who accompany the recitatives, improvise and decorate roughly twice as much as usual. Snatches of the Nokia theme, and a Bach violin partita, crept into the fortepiano flourishes. Why not? Mozart would have adored the zest of their Figaro, the Bacchanalian madness of Don Giovanni \u2013 which ended with the Don in hell, forgoing the final ensemble \u2013 and the erotic temerity of Cos\u00ec fan tutte. Currentzis\u2019s approach is old-style authoritarian. He directs every note and phrase, waving his hands right in the faces of the singers, though he refrained with Bartoli in this, their stage debut together. As well as a concert of Mozart arias, she sang Despina, in Cos\u00ec, a role she first played in 1996. Currentzis may reckon she knows how it goes. Sparky, spiky, witty and brilliant, she in turn seemed to have no objection to Currentzis\u2019s more extreme tempi. At the same time, she centred the performance with her impeccable musical intelligence and style. It was the most successful of the three operas. With too many cast members to name, special praise to Irish mezzo-soprano Paula Murrihy (Cherubino/Dorabella) and Federica Lombardi (Donna Elvira). The Greek baritone Dimitris Tiliakos and American bass-baritone Kyle Ketelsen were well matched as Don Giovanni and Leporello, with the veteran British bass Robert Lloyd making a welcome appearance as the Commendatore. To fit in with Bartoli\u2019s schedule, Currentzis broke his usual rule and conducted four concerts in a row. Lucerne festival audiences benefited. The SWR Symphony Orchestra in Stuttgart, where he recently became chief conductor, paid the price. A day later he cancelled his concerts there for September. Maddening though he may be, Currentzis is neither saviour nor charlatan. The truth is more subtle and more interesting. We may feel his influence at the Royal Opera House\u2019s new Agrippina next week, conducted by Maxim Emelyanychev. The young Russian (newly appointed music director of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra) spent time as Currentzis\u2019s harpsichordist in Perm, and shares a similarly incisive, if less reckless, verve. The ROH season began last week with two revivals, Don Giovanni \u2013 live in cinemas on 8 October \u2013 and Massenet\u2019s Werther, the third return of Beno\u00eet Jacquot\u2019s 2004 production, with designs by Charles Edwards that grow more austere and elegant as the tragedy darkens. Edward Gardner, conducting, allowed the ROH orchestra free rein in the brass-heavy, doom-laden fortissimos. There was delicacy too: the strings, in the passage accompanying Werther\u2019s letter about the grey winter sky, achieved a silvery eeriness. The Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez, tackling a vocally weightier part than usual, sang the title role. He isn\u2019t a nuanced actor but conveyed this romantic hero\u2019s relentless, lovelorn depression effectively, his voice true and passionate, almost always cutting through the orchestral outbursts. The American mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard made a striking ROH debut as Charlotte, resolute, convincing, entrancing. Albert, her dull husband, was awarded unusual depth by the South African baritone Jacques Imbrailo, who can make standing stock-still look interesting. Heather Engebretson (Sophie) and Michael Mofidian (Johann) gave classy support. As long operatic deaths go, Werther\u2019s is epic. How Charlotte managed not to splash blood on her ivory dress, and what happened when she got home, are questions we can only ponder. Star ratings (out of five) MusicAeterna/Currentzis \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Werther \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Werther continues at the Royal Opera House, London, until 5 October",

      "bodyText": "The family of Daphne Caruana Galizia, the anti-corruption journalist killed by a car bomb in Malta in October 2017, have raised concerns about the impartiality of individuals appointed to lead a public inquiry into her death. The Maltese government announced a wide-ranging inquiry late on Friday, six days before the expiry of a three-month deadline set by the Council of Europe. The announcement came after a long campaign by the family, who have been calling for greater scrutiny into what they claim is a lack of accountability for criminal actions and political corruption in Europe\u2019s smallest member state. Caruana Galizia\u2019s family have requested an urgent meeting with the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, saying: \u201cThe board [of inquiry] will be unfit for purpose if the public has reason to doubt any of its wider members\u2019 independence or impartiality.\u201d Three men are awaiting trial for allegedly planting the bomb that killed Caruana Galizia, but the police investigation to uncover who ordered her assassination has stalled. The terms of inquiry set out in a statement released by the government range from determining whether the state could have prevented the killing, to whether criminal law provisions are sufficient to prevent a culture of impunity. The commission meets in public, but its members can decide to hear some witnesses in private. The government says it expects the inquiry to take nine months. The commission will be chaired by retired judge Michael Mallia, and its two other members are a litigator and professor of law at the university of Malta and a former director of forensic science laboratories at the Malta police department. \u201cGiven the gravity of its purpose and its mandate to investigate state institutions,\u201d the family said, \u201cjustice demands that the board\u2019s wider members have no financial or political links to the current political administration\u201d. It is understood the family support the choice of Mallia as chair but have concerns about the impartiality of the other two commission members. Caruana Galizia\u2019s son, Paul, said on Twitter on Saturday morning there were \u201cserious problems with regard to the members of the Board of Inquiry announced last night\u201d. According to reports published by Maltese news outlets, one of the members, law professor and litigator Ian Refalo, has represented clients investigated by Caruana Galizia for corruption. \u201cThe establishment of a public inquiry is long overdue, and is an essential step towards justice for the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia,\u201d said Rebecca Vincent, UK bureau director of journalists\u2019 campaign group RSF. \u201cBut a public inquiry that lacks independence and impartiality will fool no one \u2013 and the goal remains full justice for this heinous assassination.

In his opinion Hodge should have been sent off.</p> <p>Instead, it was Yato who had to go. He left the field for a head injury assessment on his concussion, which he failed.

He is certain to miss Fiji\u2019s next game against Uruguay on Wednesday.</p> <p>Yato had been the best player on the pitch until that point, driving Fiji forward with his hard-charging runs through midfield. He had made three carries, two clean breaks, and beaten two defenders, for 81 metres. Now he was gone, the game slowly began to tilt back Australia\u2019s way. Worse still, it was Hodge who scored the next try, with a fine flying finish in the corner on the overlap.</p> <p>There is no blame on Australia, here. They caught a break and made every use of it. Given the way they tightened up their play in the 20 minutes after half-time, when they settled down to a lot of dirty \u2013 and deadly effective \u2013 set\u2011piece work, they may well have won anyway.</p> <p>The problem is that what everyone understood to be true from World Rugby\u2019s tackle directives, and what everyone saw play out on the pitch, did not seem to square up with each other. If the game does not seem to make sense to people who already know and love it, what chance has everyone else got?</p>",

He won a penalty by swooping on the loose ball and breaking away down the middle in a mad sprint after Christian Lealiifano had been clattered by Levani Botia. Hodge was having a hell of a day. When Yato came at him again, barnstorming down the wing after a nifty short lineout, Hodge decided to throw himself into the road like a despairing lemming. Trouble was, he did not make any effort to tackle him or even try to wrap his arms around him. In the end it was like watching a runaway truck colliding with a telegraph pole. They both came tumbling down. World Rugby\u2019s tackle directives could not be any clearer about a collision like this. Hodge did not use his arms, his shoulder collided with Yato\u2019s head, and, since they had both been standing up, there were no mitigating circumstances. Dominiko Waqaniburotu, Fiji\u2019s captain, said later he had asked the referee to have the TV match official, Rowan Kitt, take a look at it, and that O\u2019Keeffe reported back that the Englishman had not seen anything. Online, though, one of the men involved in developing those new tackle guidelines, the South African sports scientist Ross Tucker, was unequivocal. In his opinion Hodge should have been sent off. Instead, it was Yato who had to go. He left the field for a head injury assessment on his concussion, which he failed. When he reappeared, it was only so he could lie flat on his back by the side of the field, distraught that it was all over for him. He is certain to miss Fiji\u2019s next game against Uruguay on Wednesday. Yato had been the best player on the pitch until that point, driving Fiji forward with his hard-charging runs through midfield. He had made three carries, two clean breaks, and beaten two defenders, for 81 metres. Now he was gone, the game slowly began to tilt back Australia\u2019s way. Worse still, it was Hodge who scored the next try, with a fine flying finish in the corner on the overlap. There is no blame on Australia, here. They caught a break and made every use of it. Given the way they tightened up their play in the 20 minutes after half-time, when they settled down to a lot of dirty \u2013 and deadly effective \u2013 set\u2011piece work, they may well have won anyway. The problem is that what everyone understood to be true from World Rugby\u2019s tackle directives, and what everyone saw play out on the pitch, did not seem to square up with each other. If the game does not seem to make sense to people who already know and love it, what chance has everyone else got?",

Second world war anti-tank obstacles stretch across marshy lagoons with plovers and swallows, which are starting to return south, darting overhead.

      "bodyText": "A beautiful late summer\u2019s day and I\u2019m swimming in the sea, south of Shingle Street. It feels like elemental coast: a steep bronze bank of pebbles sloping down to a gentle curve of green water. Jellyfish float past under the glinting surface and a white sail drifts on the horizon. Sandwiched between the River Deben and the North Sea is an enchanting, embattled corner of Suffolk. Bleakly beautiful Shingle Street was evacuated during the second world war and rumours of a failed German invasion persist years after declassified files have shown them to be myths. A row of houses faces the sea across the stones, where there are patches of sea kale and pink-flowered sea peas and a long line of bleached shells, first put there by letter-carver Lida Kindersley and a friend. I spend the morning exploring Sutton Hoo, a mile down the road from Melton railway station. I\u2019ve caught the train to this stretch of coast several times since moving to Essex nine years ago, but a landlocked suburb-dweller\u2019s thrill at racing past shining estuaries has still not worn off. The National Trust has almost finished a \u00a34m upgrade at Sutton Hoo (\u00a313.50 adult/\u00a36.75 child). A gleaming new exhibition and glass-walled visitor centre complement the site\u2019s shady paths and valleys. Overlooking the harebell-carpeted mounds of the royal burial ground itself, where a treasure-filled 27-metre-long ship was unearthed in the 1930s, an observation tower is under construction and should be open soon. Exploring the area, I cross banks of purple heather and reedbeds alive with dragonflies. There are views across the River Deben to Woodbridge and its white weather-boarded Tide Mill. Bawdsey Hall, where I\u2019m staying, is eight miles away and I\u2019ve pre-booked demand-responsive public transport, at a fraction of the cost of a taxi (\u00a33.70 from Sutton Hoo, Connecting Communities, 01728 635938). I\u2019ve used this minibus before to access the Deben peninsula\u2019s walking and great pubs \u2013 the riverside Ramsholt Arms and the pink, thatched Sorrel Horse at Shottisham. I wander past Bawdsey\u2019s flint-towered church, where sunlight slants among the graves, and walk along the coast to Shingle Street for a swim and seaside picnic. The sun is setting behind the Martello towers as I head back. These defensive forts are just part of the area\u2019s epoch-spanning military history. Second world war anti-tank obstacles stretch across marshy lagoons with plovers and swallows, which are starting to return south, darting overhead. The area\u2019s history and wildlife attract specialists and acronyms; it\u2019s a heritage coast, an AONB, an SSSI and a lepidopterist\u2019s paradise with hundreds of moth species. Back at Bawdsey Hall, I fall asleep to the calls of owls and wake to find the trees round the misty lawn full of chirruping goldfinches and cooing doves. On a slightly inland stretch of the Suffolk Coast Path, Bawdsey Hall attracts hikers and cyclists; two fellow guests at breakfast have walked 20 miles from Ipswich via the Shotley peninsula and two ferries. Inspired, I ramble a mile or so southwards, sampling blackberries and yellow bullaces from the roadside hedges.

      "body": "<p>Tyler Mitchell was only 23 when he was invited to photograph Beyonc\u00e9 for American Vogue\u2019s September 2018 issue. In one of the two covers, she smoulders at the camera, wearing barely-there makeup and balancing a halo of colourful flowers on her head. In the other, she stands outside in an Alexander McQueen tiered dress with pan-African coloured lace, lifting white material above her natural braided hair. There is a raw beauty to both, casting the almost superhuman pop star in an unusually intimate light. But that wasn\u2019t the only noteworthy thing about the pictures: Mitchell had made history, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/08/tyler-mitchell-the-photographer-who-made-history-with-beyonce\" title=\"\">first African American photographer to shoot </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/08/tyler-mitchell-the-photographer-who-made-history-with-beyonce\" title=\"\">a Vogue</a> cover.</p> <p>A few months later, Nadine Ijewere became the first black woman to reach a similar milestone, when she shot the singer Dua Lipa in a Gucci gown for the January 2019 issue of Edward Enninful\u2019s British Vogue.

By the autumn of 2017, armed with a degree in film and television from New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts, he had decided photography was his calling and bought a one-way ticket from Atlanta to London, where he tried \u201calmost too hard to meet with every magazine and agency under the sun\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Growing up, you\u2019re taught you\u2019re gonna have to work three times as hard. I love creating a world free of that pressure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All Mitchell\u2019s work is in some way personal, starting with early photo essays such as I\u2019m Doing Pretty Hood in My Pink Polo, a series of images taken in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where he portrayed black men as vulnerable and free. Mitchell cites predecessors such as Kerry James Marshall, who \u201creimagined the projects in Chicago as a place that is lush, vibrant. Even Frederick Douglass [a key 19th-century activist, social reformer and abolitionist] knew the importance, for a black man, of creating and imagining his own image.\u201d</p> <p>The coloured backdrops and dreamy lighting of Mitchell\u2019s shoots create a fantastical world for black people to inhabit. \u201cWhen you\u2019re [black] growing up, you\u2019re taught you\u2019re gonna have to work three times as hard to get the same results as your white counterparts,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s so many different ways that this is beaten into our psyche. There\u2019s a thing said at American colleges: \u2018Look left and look right, one of you is gonna end up in jail.\u2019 I love creating a world free of that pressure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cce04f3af13853a1a340cedd62ee727047ff64e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce04f3af13853a1a340cedd62ee727047ff64e4/4_17_2357_2946/800.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled (New Royals II), Miami, 2018, by Tyler Mitchell.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled (New Royals II), Miami, 2018, by Tyler Mitchell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyler Mitchell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The primary aim is not to cater to the white gaze but to subvert it. \u201cWe\u2019re paving the way, so that others don\u2019t have to be boxed into the categories we were before,\u201d says Brooklyn-based photographer Micaiah Carter. Early on in his career, he says, the jobs given to black men tended to centre on urban life, but that didn\u2019t always interest him.

      "bodyText": "Tyler Mitchell was only 23 when he was invited to photograph Beyonc\u00e9 for American Vogue\u2019s September 2018 issue. In one of the two covers, she smoulders at the camera, wearing barely-there makeup and balancing a halo of colourful flowers on her head. In the other, she stands outside in an Alexander McQueen tiered dress with pan-African coloured lace, lifting white material above her natural braided hair. There is a raw beauty to both, casting the almost superhuman pop star in an unusually intimate light. But that wasn\u2019t the only noteworthy thing about the pictures: Mitchell had made history, as the first African American photographer to shoot a Vogue cover. A few months later, Nadine Ijewere became the first black woman to reach a similar milestone, when she shot the singer Dua Lipa in a Gucci gown for the January 2019 issue of Edward Enninful\u2019s British Vogue. Both covers were widely celebrated as landmark moments, but Mitchell is quick to level an awkward question at the media gatekeepers: \u201cWhy did it happen so late? If it were up to me, it would have happened earlier,\u201d he tells me on the phone from New York. Mitchell and Ijewere are two of 15 photographers included in The New Black Vanguard, a book curated by US art critic Antwaun Sargent that maps out a new generation of photographers who are challenging stereotypes. For hundreds of years, images of the black body as hypersexual, aggressive, brutalised and bestial have slipped into the bloodstream of society; as Sargent points out, it matters who gets to be an image-maker, who has agency over how their community is presented and perceived. These photographers are spearheading a new aesthetic in fashion and art, and are currently some of the most sought-after names in the business. The work of Campbell Addy, who runs the London-based Niijournal magazine, and has his own casting agency, featured in the recent London Get Up, Stand Up Now exhibition; while Dana Scruggs\u2019s plus-size fashion campaign for Eloquii has made waves on the New York subway. Sargent has included other names picked from across the globe \u2013 from Sheffield-based Ruth Ossai to Stephen Tayo, quickly gaining recognition for his portrayal of Lagos life, and Bronx-born Renell Medrano. It is easy to point to magazine covers as markers of changing times, but many of these photographers didn\u2019t wait for the old-guard titles to bestow approval, forging partnerships with brands such as Nike, Apple and Tiffany &amp; Co. Mitchell says that \u201calmost all\u201d his connections in the industry came about through social media; platforms such as Instagram have helped democratise the creative industries. When Ethiopian-American photographer Awol Erizku shot Beyonc\u00e9 displaying her pregnant belly in front of a wall of flowers in 2017, the set of Botticelli-like images were released solely on her Instagram account, circumventing traditional media altogether. The maternity annoucement became the most liked image on the site that year. \u201cI am trying to create a new vernacular,\u201d Erizku explains in the book, \u201cblack art as universal.\u201d Mitchell originally picked up a camera to make skateboarding films, before moving into music videos. By the autumn of 2017, armed with a degree in film and television from New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts, he had decided photography was his calling and bought a one-way ticket from Atlanta to London, where he tried \u201calmost too hard to meet with every magazine and agency under the sun\u201d. All Mitchell\u2019s work is in some way personal, starting with early photo essays such as I\u2019m Doing Pretty Hood in My Pink Polo, a series of images taken in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where he portrayed black men as vulnerable and free. Mitchell cites predecessors such as Kerry James Marshall, who \u201creimagined the projects in Chicago as a place that is lush, vibrant. Even Frederick Douglass [a key 19th-century activist, social reformer and abolitionist] knew the importance, for a black man, of creating and imagining his own image.\u201d The coloured backdrops and dreamy lighting of Mitchell\u2019s shoots create a fantastical world for black people to inhabit. \u201cWhen you\u2019re [black] growing up, you\u2019re taught you\u2019re gonna have to work three times as hard to get the same results as your white counterparts,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s so many different ways that this is beaten into our psyche. There\u2019s a thing said at American colleges: \u2018Look left and look right, one of you is gonna end up in jail.\u2019 I love creating a world free of that pressure.\u201d The primary aim is not to cater to the white gaze but to subvert it. \u201cWe\u2019re paving the way, so that others don\u2019t have to be boxed into the categories we were before,\u201d says Brooklyn-based photographer Micaiah Carter. Early on in his career, he says, the jobs given to black men tended to centre on urban life, but that didn\u2019t always interest him. This changed when he got his start in local papers, taking people\u2019s portraits and hearing their stories. He has since worked for the magazines Wonderland and the Fader, and corporate clients such as Nike, but says his style is influenced more by family albums than the fashion or art worlds. \u201cMy dad shot a lot in the army when he lived abroad, in Germany, Spain and Vietnam,\u201d he says. \u201cI also look at my grandparents\u2019 photography from the 1940s. Everything was taken with a specific intent and I try to present that in my own work.\u201d But it was focusing on his own community that ultimately helped him to find his place. \u201cMy skin colour is going to define me, whatever I am doing, but at the same time I want to show my own viewpoint and my world.\u201d An image of the singer Adeline\u2019s plaited hair, adorned with dozens of clips and accessories, is instantly recognisable to any child of the black diaspora who has sat between their mother\u2019s legs for hours as she creates similarly intricate decorations. South African photographer, Jamal Nxedlana also kicks against stereotypical ideas of black identity. His portraits of Johannesburg\u2019s cool kids pop with colour, and native and natural hairstyles; his gender fluid models contort their bodies in surprising ways. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of frustration playing out right now in South Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is an extremely violent society. I think that\u2019s a result of our past, which stems from toxic masculinity. So I suppose [my work] does something to dismantle this hyper-hyper masculine idea of what a man should be in art.\u201d In one image that Nxedlana shot and styled, a man stands in a tailored yellow jacket, representing convention and formality. \u201cI then used other symbols \u2013 a brooch, lace gloves \u2013 within fashion to disrupt and challenge notions of black masculinity,\u201d he says. After a brief stint in London, where he interned at Dazed magazine, Nxedlana returned to South Africa in 2011; he was earning too little to qualify for a working visa. But he had picked up an interest in subcultures; he knew about Teddy Boys, mods and rockers, and couldn\u2019t think of anyone who was documenting South African cliques such as Izikhothane, or the \u201cZulu guys\u201d from KwaZulu-Natal province, who listen to a specific type of music and wear the same cut of trousers. In 2015, he launched his youth culture platform Bubblegum Club. \u201cIt made unconventional voices \u2013 and ourselves \u2013 visible,\u201d he says.

As Jekyll and Hyde a performance from the French as you\u2019re ever likely to see (at least until the next time). Both sides started with understandable nerves, but it was Argentina that settled first, before a two-try blitz of sumptuous running rugby from the French lit the touch paper for this game. Los Pumas rallied just before half time but it appeared their inability to make it count had left them far too much to do in the second half. That was of course not factoring for a complete capitulation from Les Bleus after the break. Credit the Argentines, who rallied, and rucked, and mauled their way back into this by pure tenacity. As the margin crept ever tighter - from 20-3 back to 20-18 it was set for a blockbuster ending. Camille Lopez\u2019s sublime drop goal - against the run of play and with Argentina in the ascendancy - ultimately the difference, after Boffelli missed a 79th minute penalty to win it.</p> <p>Hearts in mouth.

      "bodyText": "Where to even begin with that game of rugby. As Jekyll and Hyde a performance from the French as you\u2019re ever likely to see (at least until the next time). Both sides started with understandable nerves, but it was Argentina that settled first, before a two-try blitz of sumptuous running rugby from the French lit the touch paper for this game. Los Pumas rallied just before half time but it appeared their inability to make it count had left them far too much to do in the second half. That was of course not factoring for a complete capitulation from Les Bleus after the break. Credit the Argentines, who rallied, and rucked, and mauled their way back into this by pure tenacity. As the margin crept ever tighter - from 20-3 back to 20-18 it was set for a blockbuster ending. Camille Lopez\u2019s sublime drop goal - against the run of play and with Argentina in the ascendancy - ultimately the difference, after Boffelli missed a 79th minute penalty to win it. Hearts in mouth. High drama. Ladies and Gentlemen. The 2019 Rugby World Cup has arrived. And as we catch our breath - if you missed any of that one, firstly commiserations, secondly, here\u2019s the match report: What a feast of rugby this is turning into. Fiji with a first half scare against Australia, Argentina with a second half \u00fcber-scare against France, and the big one - South Africa v New Zealand - still to come! Luke McLaughlin is your man with a plan for that one, don\u2019t even think about mowing the lawn/helping a neighbour with chores etc today: It\u2019s a hugely relieved French captain, Guilhem Guirado, at full time. He knows his side got away with one there. There was the spectre of the come-from-behind loss to Wales during the Six Nations stalking the corridors of the French minds at the end there. At least some demons have been exorised now. What courage from Argentina - that\u2019s the stuff of nightmares. They presumably copped a Ledesma lashing at half-time - they certainly came out with much better intent and aggression. But also, a return to basics. Two tries from driving mauls, classic Pumas rugby. Spare a thought for Boffelli. One of their better performers tonight - but it was his missed penalty with just 26 seconds of regulation time left in play, that could have handed Argentina a memorable win. What an incredible finish - what a remarkable game. On their first half performance, France were no chance of losing; on their second half they looked like they had no intention of winning! Camille Lopez\u2019s drop goal ultimately the inspiration. Only off the bench after a head knock to Penaud, and what a telling contribution. 80 min: It\u2019s Machenaud!! He turns it over in midfield and they kick it into touch. France have won - out of the fire! And there\u2019s a blue after the whistle. So much emotion on show, and the melee diffuses. What a dramatic conclusion!! What an incredible, topsy-turvy contest! 80 min: There\u2019s our full-time gong, but we continue. Argentina with one last play, ball in hand. They\u2019re just inside the French half - can they find the metres to line up a drop goal? 79 min: Penalty missed!! Oh my, oh my. Boffelli\u2019s almost 50m out, and he hits it hard for the distance - it looks on track, but it fades agonisingly to the left! Heartbreaking for Los Pumas fans. 78 min: They chase their own kick aggressively, Argentina, and the French just recover. Dupont with a box kick, and Boffelli recovers. And there\u2019s a penalty against France! Fickou catches Boffelli in the air - and they\u2019ve a chance at snatching this at the death! 77 min: Penalty missed! Oh my. The first one he\u2019s duffed all day - and how crucial might that be from Ntamack! The French fans in the crowd can\u2019t believe their luck. One last role of the dice, Argentina! 75 min: France work up field and Argentina are forced to clear from their own line. It will be French ball again, though - so the chance to run the clock a little. Les Bleus win their own lineout. And now there\u2019s a penalty against Argentina! Petti pinged for coming in from the side. What an error from a player who\u2019s been almost flawless all game. 74 min: Intercept by Picamoles! He\u2019s sprung out of the line and just snaps up the half-backs pass. What a contribution. Ledesma is raging in the Argentinian coaches box - was he offside, the Frenchman? 72 min: Turnover! Argentina earn the lineout as France spill the ball over the touchline. Big passage of play here. More substitutes - what a time to come into this contest. 70 min: Loose ball and France thump it downfield. Argentina return with a kick, but it\u2019s Les Bleus, ball in hand, just inside their own half. Suddenly the French crowd are back in the stadium. 69 min: Cheeky! Camille Lopez has hardly been on the pitch and he\u2019s caught Argentina napping, and slotted the drop goal from 35m out or so - it just has the distance. That\u2019s his first touch of the game! Almost a complete hush falling over the stadium as the substitute kicker lined that up. It wasn\u2019t a gimme - and he\u2019s swept the left boot through it sweetly - and all of a sudden, Argentina are back in front! What a turnabout. 68 min: Penaud leaves the field with a heavy head knock - that\u2019s a concern for French fans. We have a TMO, no infringement from Boffelli on Penaud as the two plays contested the aerial ball, game continues. They elect for the kick, Argentina. Can Urdapilleta put them in front? 66 min: Argentina look to carry, but Kremer has spilled it in contact. Fickou with ball in hand - it seems an age since we\u2019ve seen that - what can they come up with. There\u2019s a turnover, and it\u2019s Carreras racing down the touchline! He puts it on the toe but the covering defence intercept to clean up. A huge ball win from Petti - how good has he been today! And they\u2019ve the chance at a shot at goals, Argentina. 64 min: Scrum, Argentinian feed. Suddenly the Southern hemisphere nation\u2019s fans have found their voices. You didn\u2019t know there were any in the stadium for 20-odd minutes during that first half. 63 min: Bemba carries through the middle, they look to build some phases, France. Dupont rifles a high kick, and it\u2019s regathered by the French - but there\u2019s a knock on. An injury concern over Huget, who contested that kick - but he\u2019s back on his feet. 61 min: Well, well, well. They went 20 points unanswered in the first half, but now they\u2019re on the end of a 15-point response. They need to stem the bleeding, France - and we see more substitutions as Picamoles and Ramos trot into the game, with Alldritt and Medard making way. It\u2019s the substitute Benjamin Urdapilleta who takes the penalty, and it\u2019s sweetly struck by the left-footer. Over the dot. And the lead is suddenly back to just two! 57 min: A close call! They swing it wide, the French, but it\u2019s ball to ground. Almost a comical moment where nobody knew where it had gone, and Argentina almost capitalise just 20m out. It\u2019s eventually cleared - but then a big bust from Los Pumas backs! They have it midfield, it looked like there was a try begging out wide, but the French defence hold on. Penalty advantage, they\u2019ll take the shot at three. 55 min: So - how to respond if you\u2019re Jacques Brunel and his staff? They\u2019ve been very much second best since the restart. What was in the Argentine half-time sandwiches? Kremer with a big hit on the kicker Ntamack. They need some old heads to stand up for France. And it\u2019s the replacement hooker who crashes over! It\u2019s the driving maul once again. Under a penalty warning they couldn\u2019t infringe, France. It\u2019s Old Skool Rugby from the Pumas, and the replacement front rower grabs the five-pointer. No extras from Sanchez - he hooks that away to the left. We\u2019re back to one-try difference though. Game. On! 53 min: In from the side is the penalty against the French. Referee Gardner warns against a potential yellow card. A tenth penalty of the game against France. They\u2019ve not looked good since the break. 51 min: Have France survived? Or is there more pressure to come? Creevy makes way for Montoya, both sides continue to make the chances. It\u2019s another inch-perfect kick to the corner from Sanchez, they\u2019re coming again, the Pumas! 49 min: They halt the driving maul this time, France. Argentina look to mix it up - ach. It\u2019s a forward pass! Such a criminal error from the Pumas, they had a gilt-edged opportunity to put themselves right back in this game! 48 min: A lovely dummy from Cubelli, who almost sneaks through the line, but France hang on. A terrific kick to the wing by Sanchez, but Penaud covers to prevent the try. It\u2019s into touch and another Argentine offensive lineout. Big chance! 46 min: Big scrum from Argentina! They win a crucial penalty, and both sides look for the opportunity to shuffle their packs. Demba Bamba trots on for the French. What a lump of a lad. 44 min: A clever chip and chase from the French, but it\u2019s a terrific claim from de la Fuente. It bounced up nastily, and the centre just claimed it before the onrushing attackers. But they\u2019ve spilled the pill, Argentina and it\u2019s a scrum to France. Lovely forward attack! They win the lineout and get the maul driving. Petti\u2019s at the end of it, and the big second rower crashes over - there\u2019s about five of them in blue and white over the line, they\u2019ve bashed through the French defence. Sanchez adds the extras, good kick. What a start to the second half, Argentina! 42 min: Big call here for the Pumas. They win the penalty - do they take the three, or push for the line? Sanchez kicks to touch and gets it right in the corner. Good set up. What can they make of it? Sanchez gets us underway, and it\u2019s not taken cleanly, but the French recover. Dupont with the kick out of scrum-half and it\u2019s well taken at the back. Argentina on the attack. Argentina enjoyed a touch more of the possession that half (I wonder if that includes time with ball in the scrum-halve\u2019s hands awaiting resets) - but it was a whopping 308m carried by France compared to 113m for the Pumas. 17 defenders beaten, seven clean breaks, 11 offloads - and 17 missed tackles forced. You read about the attacking backlines of nations like Fiji etc - but how about that from the French? So, your assessment of that first forty? Where has the advantage been lost and gained by the two respective sides? They started slowly, the French, with Argentina enjoying the first momentum and the first points. But a two-try blitz - in quick succession - had Les Bleus very much in the ascendancy. A late scare endured as well, but they head into the sheds comfortable leaders, France. It wasn\u2019t the best of his efforts, the youngster, but it sneaks between the posts. What a way to close the half for the French. 39 min: A suspected high tackle from Cubelli. It\u2019s been a horror few minutes for the Pumas. They were right there, knocking at the door - and now as the gong sounds it\u2019s the French with a chance to extend their lead from the boot of Ntamack. 38 min: Back to back penalties - a sloppy one to concede, from Lavanini, I believe. And they get to clear their lines, the French. Now another chance to spread their wings. They push wide - was that forward? Another flowing backline move, they\u2019re rapid - the French backline. 36 min: This is a little painful. We\u2019re continuously resetting scrums. Is this over zealousness from our Australian whistle-blower, or are these two front rows just being a little naughty? We have another penalty - this time to France! They celebrate among themselves - that could be a big turning point in this match. Ledesma rages in the coaches\u2019 box - he\u2019s not happy the Argentinian boss. 35 min: Another talking to the the respective front rows. It\u2019s not going smoothly at the scrum so far. Feed to the Pumas. 5m out. Big chance. 34 min: Another penalty against the French - offside is the call. Repeat penalties, there could be a yellow here shortly. Can they make it to the break with their full complement, France? 32 min: Argentina look to get the maul driving - they\u2019re just metres from the line ... oh no! There\u2019s a deflection on the pass and the ball is put down by the runner. Angus Gardner looks at the tape and picks up the French knock on first - so they set for another scrum, Argentina. 30 min: Argentina reeling - what a blistering 15-20 minutes this has been from France. An attacking opportunity now, and they look to push for maximum points. The Pumas kick to the corner and look to set up for an attacking lineout. Ntamack - the baby of the squad lines up a penalty attempt - and it\u2019s straight as an arrow. Can they send one of these six nations kickers to the Southern hemisphere to teach the NZ and Australian kickers how it\u2019s done? Points on the board. 28 min: A set play now from the French - it\u2019s Penaud again making the metres. But, ach. It\u2019s a dropped ball. Once again they do the hard stuff, but duff the simple stuff, the French. Six carries from Penaud already, six defenders beaten. Magical. 27 min: Referee Angus Gardner has been prominent early on. He\u2019s not happy with this scrum - and talks to both teams to improve their bind. It\u2019s another scrum penalty against the French, who go slightly too early. 25 min: A spontaneous rendition of La Marseillaise rings around this fine stadium in Tokyo. Daniel Welsh writes in: Not just the anthem game these teams are winning...they\u2019re also winning the best kit competition... For those at home - it\u2019s two classic strips from both France and Argentina - I\u2019m inclined to agree. Clean, classic. Lovely. 23 min: Good hands from Penaud, Dupont and Ollivon once again - this is running rugby at its finest! But it eventually goes to ground. A break in play for an injury concern, but we\u2019re all clear. Nine offloads already, from the French. Wow. My, oh my! That was razzle dazzle stuff from the French! They didn\u2019t have much room to operate in out wide, it was brilliant from Penaud, and he\u2019s backed up on the inside by the scrum half, Dupont! He scores in the corner. Lovely. And would you believe it - from the touchline on the other side, it\u2019s Ntamack who knocks over another perfect conversion. Argentina scratching their heads - what a lightning raid from the French! 19 min: Ooph. Loose from Argentina - it\u2019s Sanchez who fumbles with the ball and they\u2019re forced to retreat and recover. A lot of vocal support for the French inside the stadium today, and they lift a gear every time Les Bleus get the ball. Lovely scamper from Ollivon, they\u2019re picking and running here, building the phases. Still a bit loose, but Fickou to keep it alive. Terrific running rugby from the French! It\u2019s Penaud who sparks it all with a lovely run - they swing the other side and it\u2019s the two centres Vakatawa and Fickou who stop and start, and pick their way through the despairing Argentine defence. And it\u2019s an excellent conversion attempt from the touchline, Ntamack adds the extras. There\u2019s the response from France! 15 min: France with a clever play, there\u2019s a footrace for the corner, but Sanchez is there first to ground and Argentina drive the line dropout. Opportunity for the French to attack. No mistake this time from Sanchez, from near dead in front. They\u2019ve started well, Argentina - some real momentum building there over the past few minutes. What can the French come up with? 13 min: Sanchez looks to put first points on the board - but he misses the penalty attempt! Let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t prove critical. It\u2019s a big run from Petti! He bashes and barges towards the line, two or three would-be defenders swatted aside - Argentina with a real chance here. 11 min: Argentinian scrum - Angus Gardner wants it reset. What a battle this will be today. And it\u2019s a penalty to the Pumas! Poirot pinged for not keeping his feet. I promise no jokes, but clearly that was one mystery he couldn\u2019t solve for the French. 9 min: Some early nerves, therefore, from both sides. No surprises there - it\u2019s the first 10 minutes of the World Cup. Big clearing kick from Argentina. But Penaud is crunched by Creevy! The French are then penalised for a late hit - it\u2019s marginal, and the crowd doesn\u2019t like the decision. 7 min: A clever popped-pass on the inside, but it\u2019s heavy traffic as Argentina struggle to make inroads. Knock on, Argentina - but France have advantage and the crowd gets engaged as they move it, ball in hand. 6 min: Ntamack flies high to claim the bomb, but he spills it forward. Argentina elect to take the lineout over the scrum - they feed right on halfway. 4 min: Good defence, France - the metres are hard up the middle for Argentina. Sanchez looks for the short crossfield kick - but he\u2019s misjudged that too! Into touch on the full - favour returned. 3 min: Intercept! France attack, ball in hand. Brilliant work Ollivon - they have four v three on the outside, France, but they look to put it on the toe. Was that the play? It ricochets off the defender and the momentum is lost. First scrum, and first penalty! It\u2019s the Argentine scrum that holds up first. Watch this space over the next 80. 2 min: Ach, it\u2019s a kicking error - not the perfect start for France, as that one flies into touch and just misses the mark. Argentina with the lineout feed just inside the French half. Allez, allez! It\u2019s France who get us underway, and Argentina receive well, but don\u2019t get too much distance on the clearance. First opportunity to run with ball in hand, they start just inside the Argentinian half, France. Anthems observed - and what an atmosphere we have here already. Not to pick favourites, but there are anthems, and there are anthems - and let\u2019s admit it: La Marseillaise is an anthem. The French players belt it out with gusto. Let\u2019s see if their early play matches that intensity. Australia\u2019s Angus Gardner will be the man with the whistle. As always fire us your best insights, quips and quibbles - via email or twitter to join the coverage. I will take late last minute predictions - but remember, your peril is potentially being wrong, on the internet, forever. Our players are heading down the tunnel - you can already hear the noise that awaits them when they emerge into the sunlight. What a tournament this is already shaping to be, full credit Japan, as we hear the war drums thunder out this stunning stadium in Tokyo. But without further ado, let\u2019s get down to team news: France: 15 Maxime Medard, 14 Damian Penaud, 13 Gael Fickou, 12 Virimi Vakatawa, 11 Yoann Huget, 10 Romain Ntamack, 9 Antoine Dupont, 8 Gregory Alldritt, 7 Charles Ollivon, 6 Wenceslas Lauret, 5 Sebastien Vahaamahina, 4 Arthur Iturria, 3 Rabah Slimani, 2 Guilhem Guirado (captain), 1 Jefferson Poirot. Bench: 16 Camille Chat, 17 Cyril Baille, 18 Demba Bamba, 19 Bernard Le Roux, 20 Louis Picamoles, 21 Maxime Machenaud, 22 Camille Lopez, Thomas Ramos Argentina: 15 Emiliano Boffelli, 14 Matias Moroni, 13 Matias Orlando, 12 Jeronimo de la Fuente, 11 Ramiro Moyano, 10 Nicolas Sanchez, 9 Tomas Cubelli, 8 Javier Ortega Desio, 7 Marcos Kremer, 6 Pablo Matera (captain), 5 Tomas Lavanini, 4 Guido Petti, 3 Juan Figallo, 2 Agustin Creevy, 1 Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro. Bench: 16 Julian Montoya, 17 Mayco Vivas, 18 Santiago Medrano, 19 Matias Alemanno, 20 Tomas Lezana, 21 Felipe Ezcurra, 22 Benjamin Urdapilleta, 23 Santiago Carreras. Alors! Thanks for your company - what a day of rugby we have today: first the tight one between Australia and Fiji - now this tasty clash, and later, the jewel in the crown of Pool action - South Africa v New Zealand. We\u2019ve got Guardian liveblog action across all three, so if you missed the earlier result, here\u2019s Gerard Meagher\u2019s report from Sapporo: From Pool D to Pool C - and what a key clash this will be. On paper it\u2019s the World No 8 v the World No 11, but those numbers are almost meaningless, given the pedigree in both these sides. Two sides very strong at the scrum, with solid forward packs. France enjoys the historical edge between these two nations 36-14 with a solitary draw, but the Argentinians have beaten the French before at World Cup level. The French have been on the wane recently in the six nations, but try telling a nation that\u2019s been to a World Cup final that they don\u2019t know how to click on the biggest stage. Similarly, it wasn\u2019t the best Rugby Championship campaign for Argentina, but at Super Rugby level the Jaguares were a rising force, so expect the national team to profit from that continuity and understanding. Plenty to like about both these sides - a tight one, and the ramifications for Pool C, and England, could be important. Pop the kettle on and settle in for this one!",

Everyone at Saracens rallied behind Duncan during his injury troubles. It has been a tough few years for him and no one would have given him a chance of making the World Cup after he smashed every ligament in his knee a year ago. \u201cHe got through it and to be starting a match in the World Cup is incredible. He is looking fit and we all know what he can do. I\u2019m just stoked to be sharing the field with him and fair play to him after all that he has been through.\u201d The lure of playing in the World Cup was Taylor\u2019s inspiration after missing out in 2015 because of a shoulder injury. \u201cI never feared the worst,\u201d he says. \u201cThe positive feedback I had from the physios at Sarries and Scotland meant I never allowed dark thoughts to enter my head. Everyone was sure I would be able to get back to my best. \u201cIt was mentally challenging but it has given me resilience. Being surrounded by so many amazing people has helped and I am confident that if more injuries come along in my career, I am in a good place to deal with them.\u201d Taylor, like the rest of his teammates, will need to be at his best if Scotland are to put themselves in control of a group that includes the hosts. Even without three injured Lions backs \u2013 Rob Kearney, Robbie Henshaw and Keith Earls \u2013 Ireland have a settled feel and boast one of the most effective half-back combinations in international rugby in Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton. \u201cIreland have threats across the backline and players of real class,\u201d says Taylor, who was born in Northampton but qualifies for Scotland through his parents. \u201cIt is a massive challenge for us in our first game and we would make a big statement if we beat them. We have had some close games with them in recent years and we know this will be a test of where we stand. \u201cWhile I am delighted to be at the World Cup after all I have been through, just being here is not enough. I want to be part of a winning side that gets through the group and into the knockout stage. \u201cThis tournament is the pinnacle for a player, something you dream of. After missing out four years ago, desperation drove me on. It will keep doing so because you want to the dream to remain for as long as possible.\u201d",

Boris is the type of teenager who sneers and smokes and steals his parents\u2019 drugs. He gets Theo into trouble and gets him out of it again. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely my favourite character I\u2019ve played so far,\u201d says Wolfhard. \u201cThere\u2019s something so interesting about someone who is so nihilistic but also really open to life.\u201d Wolfhard worked hard for the role, learning his Russian accent from YouTube videos, reading Russian literature \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/26/highereducation.classics\">Dostoyevsky\u2019s The Idiot</a> \u2013 and going through a great many fake cigarettes on set. \u201cIt was a cool change of pace to do something completely different,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Stranger Things, a lot of it is visual effects and big-budget crazy sets, so a lot of the time I\u2019m interacting with a tennis ball or something.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af0f1d7f1fbff4345bfb097325d97e1cefe2089a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af0f1d7f1fbff4345bfb097325d97e1cefe2089a/398_0_3598_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"High (avi)culture...

I love the distillation and the scale and the sensuousness of cinema.

A painting does, a novel does, a movie does. A TV series? Arguably not so much. Not yet. Perhaps it is a question of scale. Fabritius\u2019s painting of The Goldfinch is barely bigger than an A4 piece of paper. Its power comes from the way it captures such a tiny fragment of the world. Tartt\u2019s novel and Crowley\u2019s movie are both more substantial, but still they operate within the bounds set by their media.

      "body": "<p>If you have ever wondered how it feels to have your magazine guest-edited by the world\u2019s most-watched royal, here is a rough guide. Travel to Kensington Palace alone, in secret, many months before publication. Agree a plan over mint tea. Assign said royal a code name, known only to your innermost circle, and distract the rest of your staff by having them work on a completely different issue. (This may be used later, or even written off as a loss leader; it\u2019s a price worth paying for the impact the project will have.)</p> <p>For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/edward-enninful\" title=\"\">Edward Enninful</a>, who morphed from Vogue editor to covert agent when the Duchess of Sussex, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex\" title=\"\">Meghan Markle</a>, expressed an interest in guest-editing his magazine, the deception was the hardest part. \u201cEvery single day we were having secret meetings in my office,\u201d Enninful tells me, speaking on the phone a fortnight after the magazine reached newsstands. \u201cWe were just grateful for each day that went by without a leak.\u201d</p> <p>There were no royal visits to Vogue House (too much of a giveaway) but Enninful and Markle kept in touch by phone, email and through meetings at Kensington Palace. \u201cWhen the magazine came out, I spoke to everybody we\u2019d kept in the dark, explaining that it wasn\u2019t personal,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I understood that the fewer people who knew, the better. For the people in the know, they couldn\u2019t even tell their partners. Having to keep it quiet like that didn\u2019t compare to anything I\u2019d done before.\u201d</p> <p>When the time came, the final proof pages of the magazine had to be transported from Vogue HQ to the printers face down. But perhaps the most challenging step in the process came afterwards \u2013 when Enninful revealed his secret to the world, and the culture war began.</p> <p>Enninful and Markle\u2019s collaboration, <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/meghan-markle-guest-editor-september-issue-british-vogue-2019\" title=\"\">the cover</a> of which was a grid of 15 women jointly selected as \u201cForces For Change\u201d, quickly became a proxy battle about modern, diverse Britain.

The very fact of its publication became a news story around the world, generating interest and an audience that went far beyond Vogue\u2019s usual constituency. \u201cFor a magazine like Vogue to still cause a debate, especially at a time when it\u2019s supposed to be \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/10/marie-claire-uk-cease-print-publication-after-31-years\" title=\"\">the end of magazines</a>\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s pretty incredible,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe that so many people wanted to talk about it. That\u2019s what magazines did best when we were growing up, back in the day.\u201d</p> <p>But the backlash was equally loud. Markle was, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/07/31/misguided-patronising-duke-duchess-sussex-need-get-real/\" title=\"\">according to critics</a>, being unduly political, \u201cdivisive\u201d for celebrating transgender women, and \u201cleftwing\u201d for supporting progressive causes.

And it\u2019s true that, besides their shared love of fashion, literature and photography, both have experienced controversy simply for daring to occupy the space they are in. While Markle\u2019s entry to the royal family prompted endless comment \u2013 much of it openly hostile \u2013 about her biracial heritage, self-made career and feminist values, Enninful\u2019s appointment was also regarded as provocative: the first Vogue editor in the magazine\u2019s 103-year history <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/10/british-vogue-appoints-edward-enninful-as-new-editor\" title=\"\">to represent a departure from white, female privilege</a>.

Although the pages I\u2019m about to see being finalised are the product of the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s editorship, I don\u2019t know that yet; the cover and letter she has written to readers have been quietly left aside. Instead, at Enninful\u2019s desk, his own life story is laid out before me in pictures, as told through a sample of <a href=\"https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/evxx77/diversity-champion-and-i-d-family-member-edward-enninful-announced-as-the-new-editor-of-british-vogue\" title=\"\">old i-D magazines</a>, spanning a period of 20 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"755ed0e659298b09262f0ca05c82ac68b413bbcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/755ed0e659298b09262f0ca05c82ac68b413bbcc/0_0_3317_4930/673.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Enninful as a model\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As a model, in Wolfgang Tillmans\u2019 portrait \u2018Edward\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Tillmans</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is where it all started for me,\u201d Enninful says, as we examine photographs of his first modelling shoot in 1988: a sultry-looking teenager rocks a grungy camel hat and coat, shirt nonchalantly tied around his waist. It\u2019s an intriguing glimpse into the earliest phase of Enninful\u2019s fashion career, just days after he was spotted by Simon Foxton, a stylist for i-D magazine. At 16, Enninful oozes all the edgy cool and quirk of a London teen, despite having arrived in the UK only a few years earlier. His father, CK Enninful, a major in the Ghanaian military, had moved with his wife and six children to London in 1985, and his mother, Grace, a seamstress, was on her way to becoming a fashion force herself.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we lived in Ghana, my mother had been busy making clothes for everyone in high society,\u201d Enninful tells me, proudly. \u201cBut once we got to London it went to another level. I was her favourite \u2013 a sensitive creature, the gay one. We were always sketching together, and I learned how to construct clothes.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an origin story that is an irresistible departure from that of the stereotypical British Vogue editor: a larger-than-life seamstress whirring away at a seemingly endless production of figure-hugging outfits in bright lace, cotton and wax prints with her youngest son at her side, immersed in a world of hooks and eyelets, peplums and sleeves. Enninful\u2019s mother, he says, gave him his love and instinct for style. \u201cI learned my sense of colours from her. I learned to build characters. We would ask: \u2018What kind of woman wears this dress?\u2019\u201d he explains. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s made me a bit different from other stylists. I have to know the woman, put her in a location, know her character, her inner life. If I don\u2019t have a character, I can\u2019t style.\u201d</p> <p>After being spotted by Foxton and shooting his first commercial, Enninful rose quickly through the ranks of i-D magazine, becoming Foxton\u2019s assistant and then, remarkably, fashion director at just 18. Founded in 1980 by former British Vogue art director Terry Jones and his wife Tricia, i-D had by then established itself as the home of alternative style, nurturing new talent and treating street culture as serious fashion. Enninful had stumbled into the perfect home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5b7b969fcb4a3f65cbd952f5159a1e2ed618d962\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7b969fcb4a3f65cbd952f5159a1e2ed618d962/0_0_2716_3505/775.jpg\" alt=\"i-D cover 150, styled by Edward Enninful.

I don\u2019t really know anything about England,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cAt 16, I\u2019m modelling. At 18, I\u2019m editing!\u201d The Vogue editor is still surprised at the unlikeliness and speed of his ascent.</p> <p>Enninful\u2019s family had left Ghana in a hurry. His father\u2019s military service, including peacekeeping missions to Egypt and Liberia, meant that Enninful and his siblings grew up on an army barracks at Cape Coast, Ghana\u2019s one-time colonial capital. It was a \u201csheltered\u201d life, as Enninful describes it, until it wasn\u2019t. By the late 70s, General Ignatius Kutu Acheampong \u2013 a military dictator who had seized power in a coup \u2013 lost power in a second, and was executed in a third.</p> <p>The instigator of what is now remembered as one of the country\u2019s most unstable periods was a charismatic Ghanaian pilot named Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings, who assumed the leadership in 1981. \u201cI remember when Rawlings came in; I remember the shouting!\u201d Enninful recalls. \u201cI remember that some people loved him \u2013 to them, he was like the saviour of the world. But not to my father. He wasn\u2019t going to work for Rawlings.\u201d Such was the enmity between Enninful Sr and the new president that the family left the country.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I took the OBE for Dad. He cried, apparently. I had a party afterwards, and he was dancing with Madonna</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was all a blur,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cI\u2019m sure it was a disaster for me, leaving my friends, and I had my big glasses and my afro. I didn\u2019t even realise we were leaving Ghana for good. One minute we were in Vauxhall staying with an aunt, the next we were whipped off to Ladbroke Grove\u2026\u201d</p> <p>When Enninful led a trip of notable Ghanaians back to the country of his birth in 1991, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/naomi-campbell\" title=\"\">Naomi Campbell</a> and designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/ozwald-boateng\" title=\"\">Ozwald Boateng</a>, his father forbade him from meeting President Rawlings. \u201cMy dad was very clear: you cannot meet that man,\u201d he says. And on that occasion, he obeyed his father. At other times, there was conflict \u2013 especially when, aged 18, Enninful quit his degree course at Goldsmiths, University of London, to work full time at i-D. \u201cMy dad was a disciplinarian, a traditional Ghanaian and a military man,\u201d Enninful explains. \u201cMy mother knew that I was this gay, creative child, and she gave me her blessings. But my father kicked me out. I had found fashion, but I had to grow up quickly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5a6bdcbec464f01aaa02879547d1e316294eb2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5a6bdcbec464f01aaa02879547d1e316294eb2e/37_0_3925_2355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Enninful receiving his OBE at Buckingham Palace in October 2016.

I had a party afterwards, and he was dancing with Madonna. The man who once kicked me out became so proud.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Later that day, I sit in on an editorial meeting with Enninful\u2019s team, reviewing the final stages of the forthcoming issue. He has been keen to explode any preconceptions of a work environment straight out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/06/drama\" title=\"\">The Devil Wears Prada</a>, the film in which the staff of a magazine closely modelled on American Vogue are depicted as stressed-out, neurotic and harassed, while at all times dressed to kill. \u201cWe do have a lot of work to do, it is stressful,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cBut the way I work best is to be surrounded with people who are quite joyful, and to keep everything light.\u201d</p> <p>We begin in the newsroom, reviewing the website\u2019s performance for the day so far. It is hard to concentrate at first because \u2013 I\u2019m afraid to say \u2013 the staff <em>are</em> distractingly well-dressed. The digital director is wearing a hot pink catsuit, and the fashion director an elegant ensemble of black summer pleats. Enninful is clearly in charge, standing at the helm of the open-plan workspace as staff offer contributions from their desks on the floor, his tone businesslike and expectant.</p> <p>The meeting races through the day\u2019s stories: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/why-i-love-zendaya-bim-adewunmi\" title=\"\">Zendaya</a> has revealed her new Spider-Man suit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/02/heidi-klum-q-and-a-interview\" title=\"\">Heidi Klum</a> has joined Naomi Campbell on a <a href=\"https://www.bravotv.com/project-runway\" title=\"\">Project Runway</a> spin-off, Emma Corrin (who plays Princess Diana in the fourth season of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-crown\" title=\"\">The Crown</a>) is writing an exclusive Glastonbury festival diary <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/emma-corrin-princess-diana-glastonbury\" title=\"\">for the Vogue website</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kendall-jenner\" title=\"\">Kendall Jenner</a> has offered an online Q&amp;A.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f045989ae8bb205579a81f06a120cc756575a834\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f045989ae8bb205579a81f06a120cc756575a834/0_295_9937_6333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Enninful, editor-in-chief of British Vogue,  photographed at his desk in London, July 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I like to roll my sleeves up and style a lot of the covers.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastian Nevols/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In more traditional royal fashion news, Kate Middleton\u2019s reworking of a pair of Princess Diana\u2019s earrings has been a huge success. I nearly choke on my cup of tea when I hear the words, \u201cLet\u2019s re-social all of our other classic royal jewellery stories, and think about how we can lean into the jewellery community on this,\u201d wondering if the meeting has veered into parody. But royal jewellery stories, it turns out, are very serious business; this is Vogue, after all. But it\u2019s a relief to discover Enninful\u2019s team are not above sending themselves up. As we turn to the print edition, an editor says, \u201cOK, yes, we have<em> </em>done a feature on breathing. It\u2019s <em>very</em> now. It\u2019s a <em>must</em>!\u201d I\u2019m not the only one laughing.</p> <p>There is also a lively debate about what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island\" title=\"\">Love Island</a> tells us about racism, conducted with an ease that I can\u2019t help but link to the diversity in the room. And with each story, Enninful wants to know how it is performing, and why, and what\u2019s next. He is an old hand at this, and the collection of i-D magazines back in his office has aged well. In 1995 he styled a \u201cfuture of fashion\u201d edition featuring a dark-skinned black model, her luminescent eyes made up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/aug/06/beauty-queen-how-pat-mcgrath-revolutionised-makeup\" title=\"\">Pat McGrath</a>, a member of Enninful\u2019s original 80s squad of friends who, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kate-moss\" title=\"\">Kate Moss</a>, Campbell and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/steve-mcqueen\" title=\"\">Steve McQueen</a>, went on to superstardom. There are Birkenstocks, the return of bumbags (the last time around), patterned knitwear and velvet, all of which would look right at home this decade, if not this season.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They said black girls don\u2019t sell magazines, so I put Rihanna on the cover</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I tell Enninful I once met a former i-D journalist, who worked at the magazine in the early 00s and whose job it was to get hold of Enninful. She described him as a whirlwind of activity, who had \u201cabout 10 different phones and was still almost impossible to reach\u201d. He laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s true! At that stage, I was always working. I found out I love to be nonstop.\u201d</p> <p>Being i-D fashion editor was a big beat; Enninful did everything from styling the shoots to writing articles, sourcing clothes for shopping pages and dealing with advertisers. \u201cI was fearless,\u201d he says of his younger self. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any role models, anyone to show me how it was done, so I had to be. I had a duty to reflect the world I saw around me, growing up in Ladbroke Grove.

But I always let my work speak for itself.\u201d</p> <p>One of Enninful\u2019s last acts as creative director of W, in February 2017, was a YouTube video, <a href=\"https://www.wmagazine.com/story/new-york-fashion-week-2017-i-am-an-immigrant\" title=\"\">I Am An Immigrant</a>, inspired by his anger at Trump\u2019s travel ban.

There was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/04/vogue-spat-shulman-enninful-fashion\" title=\"\">barely veiled attack</a> on editors who are \u201cless magazine journalists and more celebrities or fashion personalities with substantial social media followings\u201d from departing editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/alexandra-shulman\" title=\"\">Alexandra Shulman</a>, and the frequent assertion that Enninful was some kind of fashion \u201coutsider\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat really made me laugh \u2013 how am I a fashion outsider?\u201d Enninful cries. \u201cI have been in fashion since I was 16. The suggestion that I was unknown, or, \u2018How can he edit a magazine when he\u2019s just a stylist?\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/anna-wintour\" title=\"\">Anna Wintour</a> was a stylist! <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/dec/22/franca-sozzani-editor-in-chief-of-vogue-italia-dies-aged-66\" title=\"\">Franca </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/dec/22/franca-sozzani-editor-in-chief-of-vogue-italia-dies-aged-66\" title=\"\">Sozzani</a> was a stylist! <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/diana-vreeland\" title=\"\">Diana Vreeland</a> was a stylist. I am under more scrutiny than other people,\u201d Enninful admits. \u201cBut that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d</p> <p>The magazine remains a platform for unattainable affluence and luxury, and some have criticised a particularly celebrity-heavy approach under Enninful, making its world appear even further out of reach. But he sees his work with celebrities, most of whom he styles himself (\u201cI like to roll my sleeves up [and] style a lot of the covers\u201d) as a form of subversion.</p> <p>\u201cDiversity doesn\u2019t mean downmarket \u2013 high fashion can be applied to all races, sizes, religions,\u201d Enninful explains. \u201cThey said black girls don\u2019t sell magazines, so I put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna\" title=\"\">Rihanna</a> on the cover, and I styled her myself. And they told me two things you can\u2019t do is have a black-and-white cover, and a cover model who is not looking at you. So I did <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/madonna-june-issue-british-vogue-2019\" title=\"\">a cover with Madonna</a> that was both,\u201d he says of his June 2019 edition, sold on a monochrome shot in which the pop superstar gazes away from the viewer over the side of a bathtub.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s aspirational \u2013 just look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey\" title=\"\">Oprah</a>!\u201d he declares, referencing <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/british-designers-custom-looks-oprah-winfrey-vogue-cover\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/british-designers-custom-looks-oprah-winfrey-vogue-cover\" title=\"\">August 2018 cover</a>. \u201cShe was dripping with diamonds. You couldn\u2019t think of a more high-fashion image. That\u2019s Vogue! But my work always involves documenting what\u2019s around me, and to keep normalising the marginalised. Every month I can put my hand on my heart and say it\u2019s all there: the black woman, the curvy woman, the Asian woman. We don\u2019t even think about it. It really bothered me that Vogue was seen as a magazine that is only for a certain type of woman,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it be for everyone? Why shouldn\u2019t a woman who is black, or Muslim, or gay, or a refugee, or plus-size, see themselves reflected in what we do? Our job is simple: to keep moving the needle.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>If Enninful\u2019s passion for styling came from his beloved seamstress mother, I can\u2019t help but wonder how much of his lifestyle is inherited from his military father. His daily routine, he tells me, involves waking up at 5.30am to meditate, then working out at <a href=\"https://www.bxrlondon.com/\" title=\"\">BXR</a> \u2013 the state-of-the-art gym founded by boxer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anthony-joshua\" title=\"\">Anthony Joshua</a> \u2013 where he likes to use the gruelling <a href=\"https://www.bxrlondon.com/sweat-cardio.html\" title=\"\">VersaClimber </a>machine. He eats, he says, \u201cvery, very well. I love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/10/jollof-rice\" title=\"\">jollof rice</a>,\u201d he continues, speaking wistfully of the traditional West African dish, \u201cand Jamaican rice and peas. But I gain weight easily, and these days I don\u2019t eat it too often.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f114698fe4db1efae91808d3961dd261c6549f65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f114698fe4db1efae91808d3961dd261c6549f65/502_0_3278_2195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Enninful and Kate Moss at The Daily Front Row Fashion Media Awards, Inside, Spring Summer 2020, New York Fashion Week, USA - 05 Sep 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Kate Moss, one of Enninful\u2019s original 80s squad of friends who went on to superstardom.

Perhaps this is an endorsement of Enninful\u2019s approach, which is unapologetically crowd-pleasing. \u201cFor the covers, we just figure out who represents the zeitgeist \u2013 women we love who are making some kind of a statement, and women who are having an impact on culture,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat links the cover images is a sense of classicism, modernity, and a certain throwback aspect.\u201d</p> <p>And he seems to love a good throwback. In his office, there is one more magazine he wants to show me: a 2017 edition of the men\u2019s style magazine Arena Homme.

Despite his long career, Enninful still revels in the improbability of this state-school-educated, gay, black immigrant ending up as the editor of British Vogue. \u201cThis is where I could have ended up,\u201d Enninful says, pointing at the fast food restaurant. \u201cThat could have been the alternative.\u201d It\u2019s an image he cherishes \u2013 not because of where he is, but because of how far he has come.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you have ever wondered how it feels to have your magazine guest-edited by the world\u2019s most-watched royal, here is a rough guide. Travel to Kensington Palace alone, in secret, many months before publication. Agree a plan over mint tea. Assign said royal a code name, known only to your innermost circle, and distract the rest of your staff by having them work on a completely different issue. (This may be used later, or even written off as a loss leader; it\u2019s a price worth paying for the impact the project will have.) For Edward Enninful, who morphed from Vogue editor to covert agent when the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, expressed an interest in guest-editing his magazine, the deception was the hardest part. \u201cEvery single day we were having secret meetings in my office,\u201d Enninful tells me, speaking on the phone a fortnight after the magazine reached newsstands. \u201cWe were just grateful for each day that went by without a leak.\u201d There were no royal visits to Vogue House (too much of a giveaway) but Enninful and Markle kept in touch by phone, email and through meetings at Kensington Palace. \u201cWhen the magazine came out, I spoke to everybody we\u2019d kept in the dark, explaining that it wasn\u2019t personal,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I understood that the fewer people who knew, the better. For the people in the know, they couldn\u2019t even tell their partners. Having to keep it quiet like that didn\u2019t compare to anything I\u2019d done before.\u201d When the time came, the final proof pages of the magazine had to be transported from Vogue HQ to the printers face down. But perhaps the most challenging step in the process came afterwards \u2013 when Enninful revealed his secret to the world, and the culture war began. Enninful and Markle\u2019s collaboration, the cover of which was a grid of 15 women jointly selected as \u201cForces For Change\u201d, quickly became a proxy battle about modern, diverse Britain. Its ferocity was not something the editor saw coming. \u201cI was so engrossed in these women, and in the magazine,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe were not trying to create an issue that was shocking \u2013 we were shining a light on incredible women, some who are not famous at all.\u201d The September Vogue, which Markle has described as having her \u201cthumbprint\u201d all over it, reportedly sold out in just two weeks, and is currently being auctioned for more than five times its \u00a33.99 cover price on eBay. The very fact of its publication became a news story around the world, generating interest and an audience that went far beyond Vogue\u2019s usual constituency. \u201cFor a magazine like Vogue to still cause a debate, especially at a time when it\u2019s supposed to be \u2018the end of magazines\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s pretty incredible,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe that so many people wanted to talk about it. That\u2019s what magazines did best when we were growing up, back in the day.\u201d But the backlash was equally loud. Markle was, according to critics, being unduly political, \u201cdivisive\u201d for celebrating transgender women, and \u201cleftwing\u201d for supporting progressive causes. One entertainment writer even professed to know the inner thoughts of the monarch, claiming: \u201cThe Queen will think this is an absolutely idiotic, ridiculous decision, as do I.\u201d After the dust settled, Markle\u2019s noisiest rightwing critics \u2013 Melanie Phillips and Sarah Vine among them\u2013 moved on to their next target, leaving only the trolling dregs. \u201cWas the criticism racist? Some of it, yeah,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cActually it was more than racism,\u201d he adds. \u201cI thought it was personal \u2013 attacking someone you don\u2019t know, attacking her.\u201d The double standard at work was hard to ignore. While Enninful and Markle\u2019s collaboration prompted sneers, Prince Charles\u2019s two-time guest editorship of Country Life magazine, and stints by Prince Harry at Radio 4\u2019s Today programme and Kate Middleton at Huffington Post, had been quietly praised at the time. Many of the criticisms aimed at Markle \u2013 she was branded \u201cuppity\u201d for assuming the role, and accused of being \u201canti-white\u201d for focusing on diversity \u2013 are familiar tropes aimed at people of colour who enter white spaces and fail to seek white approval, or who celebrate their heritage and diversity. Enninful says that Markle\u2019s first email to him proposing a collaboration \u2013 which he describes as being signed somewhat cryptically with a single \u201cM\u201d \u2013 suggested that they would have \u201clots in common\u201d. And it\u2019s true that, besides their shared love of fashion, literature and photography, both have experienced controversy simply for daring to occupy the space they are in. While Markle\u2019s entry to the royal family prompted endless comment \u2013 much of it openly hostile \u2013 about her biracial heritage, self-made career and feminist values, Enninful\u2019s appointment was also regarded as provocative: the first Vogue editor in the magazine\u2019s 103-year history to represent a departure from white, female privilege. This 47-year-old, gay, state-school-educated Ghanaian immigrant is, it\u2019s fair to say, a serial offender when it comes to the crime of editing while being black. *** Enninful and I sit down for the first time six weeks before publication of the Markle issue, in his bright and uncluttered office, high up in Vogue House. Although the pages I\u2019m about to see being finalised are the product of the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s editorship, I don\u2019t know that yet; the cover and letter she has written to readers have been quietly left aside. Instead, at Enninful\u2019s desk, his own life story is laid out before me in pictures, as told through a sample of old i-D magazines, spanning a period of 20 years. \u201cThis is where it all started for me,\u201d Enninful says, as we examine photographs of his first modelling shoot in 1988: a sultry-looking teenager rocks a grungy camel hat and coat, shirt nonchalantly tied around his waist. It\u2019s an intriguing glimpse into the earliest phase of Enninful\u2019s fashion career, just days after he was spotted by Simon Foxton, a stylist for i-D magazine. At 16, Enninful oozes all the edgy cool and quirk of a London teen, despite having arrived in the UK only a few years earlier. His father, CK Enninful, a major in the Ghanaian military, had moved with his wife and six children to London in 1985, and his mother, Grace, a seamstress, was on her way to becoming a fashion force herself. \u201cWhen we lived in Ghana, my mother had been busy making clothes for everyone in high society,\u201d Enninful tells me, proudly. \u201cBut once we got to London it went to another level. I was her favourite \u2013 a sensitive creature, the gay one. We were always sketching together, and I learned how to construct clothes.\u201d It\u2019s an origin story that is an irresistible departure from that of the stereotypical British Vogue editor: a larger-than-life seamstress whirring away at a seemingly endless production of figure-hugging outfits in bright lace, cotton and wax prints with her youngest son at her side, immersed in a world of hooks and eyelets, peplums and sleeves. Enninful\u2019s mother, he says, gave him his love and instinct for style. \u201cI learned my sense of colours from her. I learned to build characters. We would ask: \u2018What kind of woman wears this dress?\u2019\u201d he explains. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s made me a bit different from other stylists. I have to know the woman, put her in a location, know her character, her inner life. If I don\u2019t have a character, I can\u2019t style.\u201d After being spotted by Foxton and shooting his first commercial, Enninful rose quickly through the ranks of i-D magazine, becoming Foxton\u2019s assistant and then, remarkably, fashion director at just 18. Founded in 1980 by former British Vogue art director Terry Jones and his wife Tricia, i-D had by then established itself as the home of alternative style, nurturing new talent and treating street culture as serious fashion. Enninful had stumbled into the perfect home. \u201cAt 13, I arrive from Ghana. I don\u2019t really know anything about England,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cAt 16, I\u2019m modelling. At 18, I\u2019m editing!\u201d The Vogue editor is still surprised at the unlikeliness and speed of his ascent. Enninful\u2019s family had left Ghana in a hurry. His father\u2019s military service, including peacekeeping missions to Egypt and Liberia, meant that Enninful and his siblings grew up on an army barracks at Cape Coast, Ghana\u2019s one-time colonial capital. It was a \u201csheltered\u201d life, as Enninful describes it, until it wasn\u2019t. By the late 70s, General Ignatius Kutu Acheampong \u2013 a military dictator who had seized power in a coup \u2013 lost power in a second, and was executed in a third. The instigator of what is now remembered as one of the country\u2019s most unstable periods was a charismatic Ghanaian pilot named Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings, who assumed the leadership in 1981. \u201cI remember when Rawlings came in; I remember the shouting!\u201d Enninful recalls. \u201cI remember that some people loved him \u2013 to them, he was like the saviour of the world. But not to my father. He wasn\u2019t going to work for Rawlings.\u201d Such was the enmity between Enninful Sr and the new president that the family left the country. \u201cIt was all a blur,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cI\u2019m sure it was a disaster for me, leaving my friends, and I had my big glasses and my afro. I didn\u2019t even realise we were leaving Ghana for good. One minute we were in Vauxhall staying with an aunt, the next we were whipped off to Ladbroke Grove\u2026\u201d When Enninful led a trip of notable Ghanaians back to the country of his birth in 1991, alongside Naomi Campbell and designer Ozwald Boateng, his father forbade him from meeting President Rawlings. \u201cMy dad was very clear: you cannot meet that man,\u201d he says. And on that occasion, he obeyed his father. At other times, there was conflict \u2013 especially when, aged 18, Enninful quit his degree course at Goldsmiths, University of London, to work full time at i-D. \u201cMy dad was a disciplinarian, a traditional Ghanaian and a military man,\u201d Enninful explains. \u201cMy mother knew that I was this gay, creative child, and she gave me her blessings. But my father kicked me out. I had found fashion, but I had to grow up quickly.\u201d Reconciliation with his father came gradually, Enninful says, culminating in his decision in 2016 to accept an honour. \u201cI took the OBE for Dad,\u201d he says. \u201cHe cried, apparently, and I was glad to give him that. I had a party afterwards, and he was dancing with Madonna. The man who once kicked me out became so proud.\u201d *** Later that day, I sit in on an editorial meeting with Enninful\u2019s team, reviewing the final stages of the forthcoming issue. He has been keen to explode any preconceptions of a work environment straight out of The Devil Wears Prada, the film in which the staff of a magazine closely modelled on American Vogue are depicted as stressed-out, neurotic and harassed, while at all times dressed to kill. \u201cWe do have a lot of work to do, it is stressful,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cBut the way I work best is to be surrounded with people who are quite joyful, and to keep everything light.\u201d We begin in the newsroom, reviewing the website\u2019s performance for the day so far. It is hard to concentrate at first because \u2013 I\u2019m afraid to say \u2013 the staff are distractingly well-dressed. The digital director is wearing a hot pink catsuit, and the fashion director an elegant ensemble of black summer pleats. Enninful is clearly in charge, standing at the helm of the open-plan workspace as staff offer contributions from their desks on the floor, his tone businesslike and expectant. The meeting races through the day\u2019s stories: Zendaya has revealed her new Spider-Man suit, Heidi Klum has joined Naomi Campbell on a Project Runway spin-off, Emma Corrin (who plays Princess Diana in the fourth season of The Crown) is writing an exclusive Glastonbury festival diary for the Vogue website and Kendall Jenner has offered an online Q&amp;A. In more traditional royal fashion news, Kate Middleton\u2019s reworking of a pair of Princess Diana\u2019s earrings has been a huge success. I nearly choke on my cup of tea when I hear the words, \u201cLet\u2019s re-social all of our other classic royal jewellery stories, and think about how we can lean into the jewellery community on this,\u201d wondering if the meeting has veered into parody. But royal jewellery stories, it turns out, are very serious business; this is Vogue, after all. But it\u2019s a relief to discover Enninful\u2019s team are not above sending themselves up. As we turn to the print edition, an editor says, \u201cOK, yes, we have done a feature on breathing. It\u2019s very now. It\u2019s a must!\u201d I\u2019m not the only one laughing. There is also a lively debate about what Love Island tells us about racism, conducted with an ease that I can\u2019t help but link to the diversity in the room. And with each story, Enninful wants to know how it is performing, and why, and what\u2019s next. He is an old hand at this, and the collection of i-D magazines back in his office has aged well. In 1995 he styled a \u201cfuture of fashion\u201d edition featuring a dark-skinned black model, her luminescent eyes made up by Pat McGrath, a member of Enninful\u2019s original 80s squad of friends who, alongside Kate Moss, Campbell and Steve McQueen, went on to superstardom. There are Birkenstocks, the return of bumbags (the last time around), patterned knitwear and velvet, all of which would look right at home this decade, if not this season. I tell Enninful I once met a former i-D journalist, who worked at the magazine in the early 00s and whose job it was to get hold of Enninful. She described him as a whirlwind of activity, who had \u201cabout 10 different phones and was still almost impossible to reach\u201d. He laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s true! At that stage, I was always working. I found out I love to be nonstop.\u201d Being i-D fashion editor was a big beat; Enninful did everything from styling the shoots to writing articles, sourcing clothes for shopping pages and dealing with advertisers. \u201cI was fearless,\u201d he says of his younger self. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any role models, anyone to show me how it was done, so I had to be. I had a duty to reflect the world I saw around me, growing up in Ladbroke Grove. People said it was edgy, but for me it was normal \u2013 it was literally what I saw.\u201d He was not afraid to criticise his own industry. On being missed off the guestlist for a John Galliano show in 1995, he wrote: \u201cWho knows: maybe next year the people who have supported Galliano since leaving college will be privileged to join the ranks of those allowed to see his collection. Still, that\u2019s fashion. Plus \u00e7a change\u2026\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of a tweet Enninful posted decades later, in 2013. By then fashion director at W magazine, he wrote from a New York fashion show: \u201cIf all my (white) counterparts are seated in the front row, why should I be expected to take 2nd row? racism? xoxo.\u201d His pointed comment was widely shared, but Enninful won\u2019t discuss this specific incident now. \u201cI never let racism question my confidence. I don\u2019t shy away from it. But I always let my work speak for itself.\u201d One of Enninful\u2019s last acts as creative director of W, in February 2017, was a YouTube video, I Am An Immigrant, inspired by his anger at Trump\u2019s travel ban. At British Vogue, he has published the first cover of a model wearing a hijab \u2013 the diminutive and dazzling Halima Aden. But despite working at the top of the fashion world for three decades, his appointment as Vogue editor in April 2017 was met with scepticism. There was the barely veiled attack on editors who are \u201cless magazine journalists and more celebrities or fashion personalities with substantial social media followings\u201d from departing editor Alexandra Shulman, and the frequent assertion that Enninful was some kind of fashion \u201coutsider\u201d. \u201cThat really made me laugh \u2013 how am I a fashion outsider?\u201d Enninful cries. \u201cI have been in fashion since I was 16. The suggestion that I was unknown, or, \u2018How can he edit a magazine when he\u2019s just a stylist?\u2019 Anna Wintour was a stylist! Franca Sozzani was a stylist! Diana Vreeland was a stylist. I am under more scrutiny than other people,\u201d Enninful admits. \u201cBut that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d The magazine remains a platform for unattainable affluence and luxury, and some have criticised a particularly celebrity-heavy approach under Enninful, making its world appear even further out of reach. But he sees his work with celebrities, most of whom he styles himself (\u201cI like to roll my sleeves up [and] style a lot of the covers\u201d) as a form of subversion. \u201cDiversity doesn\u2019t mean downmarket \u2013 high fashion can be applied to all races, sizes, religions,\u201d Enninful explains. \u201cThey said black girls don\u2019t sell magazines, so I put Rihanna on the cover, and I styled her myself. And they told me two things you can\u2019t do is have a black-and-white cover, and a cover model who is not looking at you. So I did a cover with Madonna that was both,\u201d he says of his June 2019 edition, sold on a monochrome shot in which the pop superstar gazes away from the viewer over the side of a bathtub. \u201cIt\u2019s aspirational \u2013 just look at Oprah!\u201d he declares, referencing the August 2018 cover. \u201cShe was dripping with diamonds. You couldn\u2019t think of a more high-fashion image. That\u2019s Vogue! But my work always involves documenting what\u2019s around me, and to keep normalising the marginalised. Every month I can put my hand on my heart and say it\u2019s all there: the black woman, the curvy woman, the Asian woman. We don\u2019t even think about it. It really bothered me that Vogue was seen as a magazine that is only for a certain type of woman,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it be for everyone? Why shouldn\u2019t a woman who is black, or Muslim, or gay, or a refugee, or plus-size, see themselves reflected in what we do? Our job is simple: to keep moving the needle.\u201d *** If Enninful\u2019s passion for styling came from his beloved seamstress mother, I can\u2019t help but wonder how much of his lifestyle is inherited from his military father. His daily routine, he tells me, involves waking up at 5.30am to meditate, then working out at BXR \u2013 the state-of-the-art gym founded by boxer Anthony Joshua \u2013 where he likes to use the gruelling VersaClimber machine. He eats, he says, \u201cvery, very well. I love jollof rice,\u201d he continues, speaking wistfully of the traditional West African dish, \u201cand Jamaican rice and peas. But I gain weight easily, and these days I don\u2019t eat it too often.\u201d He still lives in west London, with his partner Alec Maxwell, a film-maker to whom he has been engaged for 14 years, and their dog Ru, a black-and-white Boston terrier, whose Instagram account (14,600 followers) shows him sandwiched between Claudia Schiffer and Donatella Versace. But Enninful says he makes plenty of time for work, fortified by his early-morning regime, a healthy diet and a disciplined attitude towards parties \u2013 \u201cI dip in and out.\u201d There is, after all, a lot of work to do. The market for women\u2019s magazines is tough, with some Vogue rivals \u2013 such as Cosmopolitan, whose circulation dropped by a third between January and June this year \u2013 clearly struggling. This month, it was announced that the British edition of Marie Claire would cease print publication after 31 years, while Vogue\u2019s parent company, Cond\u00e9 Nast, stopped Glamour\u2019s monthly print edition in 2018. Last year, however, Cond\u00e9 Nast turned 2017\u2019s \u00a314m pre-tax loss into a profit; sales of Vogue have remained stable at 192,212, while its digital revenues have risen by 40%, year-on-year. The magazine is still selling more copies than its rivals \u2013 more than double the circulations of Vanity Fair and Tatler. Meanwhile, it is the editions with a strong Enninful stamp that seem to have fared best on the newsstand; last year\u2019s September issue featuring Rihanna, and his Ariana Grande cover last July came close to selling out; the Markle Forces For Change edition overtook the previous September issue after just 12 days on sale. Perhaps this is an endorsement of Enninful\u2019s approach, which is unapologetically crowd-pleasing. \u201cFor the covers, we just figure out who represents the zeitgeist \u2013 women we love who are making some kind of a statement, and women who are having an impact on culture,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat links the cover images is a sense of classicism, modernity, and a certain throwback aspect.\u201d And he seems to love a good throwback. In his office, there is one more magazine he wants to show me: a 2017 edition of the men\u2019s style magazine Arena Homme. The photographer Juergen Teller shot Enninful for it sitting on an ornate chair before a marble table, manoeuvring a piece on a chessboard. \u201cCan you see what he did? The black versus the white \u2013 his pictures are so loaded,\u201d Enninful says, admiringly. For him, however, the most powerful image in the shoot shows him standing in front of a Burger King. Despite his long career, Enninful still revels in the improbability of this state-school-educated, gay, black immigrant ending up as the editor of British Vogue. \u201cThis is where I could have ended up,\u201d Enninful says, pointing at the fast food restaurant. \u201cThat could have been the alternative.\u201d It\u2019s an image he cherishes \u2013 not because of where he is, but because of how far he has come. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Which is great news if you want to spend more of these darker mornings in bed. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

Letting Jackie into the story helped, because she asked the questions that people didn\u2019t want to answer.\u201d</p> <p>Both women encountered hostility when they began their inquiries. Lacy had neighbors come up to her asking her why she was stirring things up, encouraging outsiders to come into town to tell them how to behave.</p> <p>Even some of her own relatives advised her to let go of the fight for justice for Lennon.

When Olive first began filming in communities in 2010 very few people \u2013 white or black \u2013 were willing to face up to the fact that their own town had such a dark past.</p> <p>\u201cMost communities were in denial,\u201d Olive said. \u201cThese were places where half the town would have turned up in thousands to a lynching, openly cheering it on.

      "body": "<p>You\u2019ve probably noticed that bemoaning the lack of cinema release for certain outstanding films is a recurring theme in this column, so here\u2019s a change of tune. One of the year\u2019s loveliest arthouse releases did in fact get a big-screen UK airing back in the spring, courtesy of plucky indie distributor <a href=\"https://www.day-for-night.org/\" title=\"\">Day for Night</a>. Still, if you didn\u2019t see or hear of Chilean director Dominga Sotomayor\u2019s richly evocative growing-up study <strong>Too Late to Die Young</strong>, that\u2019s understandable. It was in a handful of cinemas, and, the market being what it is, didn\u2019t stick around for long.</p> <p>Thankfully, Mubi.com is offering its subscribers <a href=\"https://mubi.com/showing/too-late-to-die-young\" title=\"\">a second chance</a> to catch up with the film, as well as with Sotomayor\u2019s earlier work. Just three films in and she\u2019s already among the most exciting and distinctive talents in South American cinema. <em>Too Late to Die Young </em>(not to be confused with Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/20/too-old-to-die-young-nicolas-winding-refn-amazon-show-an-indulgence-too-far\" title=\"\">grisly-gorgeous</a> TV series <em>Too Old to Die Young</em>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Too-Old-Die-Young-Season/dp/B07NTV427M\" title=\"\">streaming on Amazon</a>) went up on Mubi early last week and is probably the best place to start, being Sotomayor\u2019s most fully realised and widely seen work to date. Prior to its UK release, it competed for best film at the London film festival and won her <a href=\"https://www.locarnofestival.ch/pardo/pardo-live/today-at-festival/2018/day-11/Dominga-Sotomayor.html\" title=\"\">best director at Locarno</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s a coming-of-age film \u2013 a saturated genre, admittedly, though Sotomayor (b1985) takes the term more literally and specifically than most. Rather than a generic adolescent story, <em>Too Late to Die Young</em> offers an exacting, sensuous look at the precise, awkward bridging point between overgrown childhood and unknowing adulthood, tracing the curdling impulses of youth and maturity in its 16-year-old protagonist with compassion and humour.</p> <p>The lives in focus aren\u2019t exactly normal ones. Sofia (the enchanting Demian Hern\u00e1ndez) lives with her father in an isolated rural commune. It\u2019s 1990, in the immediate aftermath of Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship, and while their tranquil surroundings muffle its political impact, Sofia, who is preparing to move in with her mother in Santiago, picks up on the country\u2019s restless new energy. As New Year\u2019s Eve approaches, feeling more momentous than usual, Sofia, her drifting friend Lucas and new arrival Clara wrestle with their ambitions and their cut-off lifestyle. Inspired by the director\u2019s own commune-based upbringing, all the bristling frustration and dreamy hope feels duly pulled from the heart.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW8IqaJcR8Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aW8IqaJcR8Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW8IqaJcR8Q\">Watch a trailer for Too Late to Die Young.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>More modest in scope but just as finely textured and affecting is Sotomayor\u2019s 2012 debut, <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/thursday-till-sunday\" title=\"\">Thursday Till Sunday</a></strong>, which hits Mubi\u2019s menu .

He\u2019s been proven right, though my praise would be less qualified than his. Sotomayor plays gently with the form and rhythms of the road movie in this intimate look at a family car trip as seen through the eyes of 10-year-old Luc\u00eda (Santi Ahumada), which are more perceptive than her frostily arguing parents realise.</p> <p>The family is ostensibly heading on vacation, though the mood isn\u2019t celebratory: Sotomayor exquisitely captures the strained sense of pretence in a family unit seemingly on borrowed time. Ahumada\u2019s remarkable performance, meanwhile, proves the director\u2019s delicate facility with young actors right off the bat.</p> <p>A couple on a tense vacation is also the subject of Sotomayor\u2019s second, least well-known film, <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/mar\" title=\"\">Mar</a></strong>, which starts streaming on Mubi on 30 September. (This one never got a UK release after premiering at the 2015 Berlin fest, so the chance to see it is quite rare.) Yet it\u2019s the odd one out among her films, in much the way that <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/27/exhibition-review-joanna-hogg-uncomfortably-frank\" title=\"\">Exhibition</a></em> stands icily apart in Joanna Hogg\u2019s catalogue.</p> <p>More emotionally cool and improvisational in technique, <em>Mar</em> is only an hour long, and its study of a soured thirtysomething romance \u2013 no kids in this one \u2013 is more arch and elusive than either of the films bookending it. Still, the casual ease of Sotomayor\u2019s craft and the patient serenity of her gaze mark it as unmistakably hers. Where she goes from this mini-retrospective will be fascinating to see.</p> <h2>Also new on DVD and streaming</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaba1acbf7864d41e33807d43a20cf417b643989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaba1acbf7864d41e33807d43a20cf417b643989/0_4_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elsie Fisher stars in Eighth Grade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elsie Fisher in Eighth Grade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Eighth Grade<br></strong><em>(Sony, 15)<br></em>As befits its youthful focus, there\u2019s no physical media release for Bo Burnham\u2019s tender, uproarious, achingly well-observed study of a 13-year-old girl surviving the last week of US middle school.

A couple on a tense vacation is also the subject of Sotomayor\u2019s second, least well-known film, Mar, which starts streaming on Mubi on 30 September. (This one never got a UK release after premiering at the 2015 Berlin fest, so the chance to see it is quite rare.) Yet it\u2019s the odd one out among her films, in much the way that Exhibition stands icily apart in Joanna Hogg\u2019s catalogue. More emotionally cool and improvisational in technique, Mar is only an hour long, and its study of a soured thirtysomething romance \u2013 no kids in this one \u2013 is more arch and elusive than either of the films bookending it. Still, the casual ease of Sotomayor\u2019s craft and the patient serenity of her gaze mark it as unmistakably hers. Where she goes from this mini-retrospective will be fascinating to see. Also new on DVD and streaming Eighth Grade (Sony, 15) As befits its youthful focus, there\u2019s no physical media release for Bo Burnham\u2019s tender, uproarious, achingly well-observed study of a 13-year-old girl surviving the last week of US middle school. It\u2019s available to stream via Amazon and the like. Mapplethorpe (Signature, 15) Skipping cinemas and heading straight to VOD is this disappointingly tame, impersonal biopic of defiantly queer photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, with Matt Smith working hard but frankly miscast in the role. Our Time (Drakes Avenue, 15) One for the devotees of Mexican auteur Carlos Reygadas only \u2013 though it might even test some of them \u2013 this three-hour autobio-docu-hybrid-wotsit is boundary-testing and often starkly beautiful, but a pretty arduous test of faith. Aladdin (Disney, PG) Within the ranks of Disney\u2019s recent spate of self-remakes, Guy Ritchie\u2019s live-action Arabian Nights tale isn\u2019t terrible \u2013 there are some lively numbers, and the cast is game \u2013 but neither does it answer the question of why, economic interests aside, it should exist.",

      "bodyText": "So, it\u2019s one from one in Pool D for Australia, as they start their ninth World Cup campaign in the manner they\u2019ve started eight previously, with a win. For nearly 50 minutes they were absolutely in a battle here - Fiji were expected to be fearsome with ball in hand, but especially in the first half the Pasifika nation also looked well-organised, disciplined and solid at the set piece. They led at the break, and even jumped to a nine-point lead early in the second half, but whether fitness or depth played a part, it was Australia that finished by far the stronger side. A change of tactics - a reversion to a simpler form of rugby, built on clever kicking and solid metres up the centre - probably played a part in the significant shift of momentum. Fiji saw a man dismissed for repeated infringements and the Wallabies were ruthless in prosecuting their advantage. A bruising encounter first up - plenty to come from this group with Wales, Georgia and Uruguay still to come! A tweet in from Michael: What do you think, folks back home? There was certainly a huge momentum change about 60 minutes into that one - but were Fiji starting to fade before the yellow card for repeated infringements? Australia were good in the scrum, solid in the lineout and started to get on top with the driving mauls. We\u2019ll wait to see what coach John McKee makes of it all the post-game presser, I guess. So! A first look at Pool D action. Your thoughts on that opening clash? Michael Hooper looks a relieved man after the match. \u201cAre you happy with that one?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d And can you blame him. 18 points the difference at the end - you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone who would tell you that that was an eighteen point match, though. And after a bonus five minutes (that might have felt an eternity for aching limbs) its Pocock who gets his hands on the pill and boots it into touch! That\u2019s the game, that\u2019s the win for Australia. They\u2019ve come through a tough first-up examination - and just got over the line. 80 min: And there\u2019s that gong again (love it). Fiji earn the penalty and they look to play on - can they salvage a late consolation try? It\u2019s a Fijian lineout 5m out and they go short. There\u2019s another advantage for collapsing the maul, and we play an extra few minutes. I don\u2019t think guys like Pocock fancy this - it\u2019s been a long hard road back from injury for some. They go short with another line out, and it\u2019s a knock on as Slipper dives for the intercept but can\u2019t hold it. We play on. 79 min: Australia get isolated and Fiji win the turnover. One last chance for Fiji to show their backline pace. There\u2019s a knock on though, and the chance is lost. Some big tired bodies out there. 77 min: Over 40,000 fans in tonight in Sapporo, and they\u2019ve seen some decent rugby tonight - even if the neutral might have wanted to see it finish a little closer. 75 min: it\u2019s Australia, once again on the attack. It\u2019s a tough scoreline this - if you wandered in you\u2019d think it was a comfortable margin for the Wallabies, but for 60 or so minutes it was anything but. Fiji have grounds to be aggrieved - they\u2019ve been so good for so long, but it\u2019s those championship minutes that have come to haunt them. 73 min: Good work from Dane Haylett-Petty, fresh off the bench, to make space out wide for the flyer, Koroibete - and the former Melbourne Storm man scores in the corner! Toomua with the attempt from near the touchline - and the legs are warm now, and he slots it! 71 min: A close up of a frustrated John McKee in the Fijian coaching box. He came so close to engineering a stunning first-up result here today, but perhaps that reaction tells you that he knows his side have finally let this one slip. 68 min: They\u2019re besieging the Fijian line here - Australia, but so far the defence has been okay around the ball. They swing it wide for a change, and the man advantage pays dividend. It\u2019s the outside centre who crashes over - and surely, that\u2019s the resistance broken. Toomua slots that one, and he adds the two extra points. 66 min: Jordan Uelese with the lineout feed as Latu leaves the pitch the first hooker to have ever scored a World Cup double. But he misses the jumper! Let off for Fiji. They clear their lines, but not huge metres. Australia come again, but it\u2019s a terrific steal from the fullback Murimurivalu with the Wallabies threatening once again! 64 min: So, after just over an hour - finally the Wallabies hit the front. Can they take advantage of the one-man advantage? Another penalty to Australia, they\u2019ve got all the momentum, the 2015 World Cup finalists. 61 min: Yellow card! They had the warning - as Australia were on the attack once again it was another penalty against Fiji, and it\u2019s the inside centre Levani Botia who\u2019s sent to the sin bin. It\u2019s almost a carbon copy play from Australia - they get the push moving, Fiji try to defend but they spin it left this time, and it\u2019s a rare try double for the hooker, Latu! A third different kicker for the Wallabies, as Matt Toomua - freshly on for Leali\u2019ifano - who tries his hand (or foot). But it just slides to the left! Important misses, these. Will it prove costly? 60 min: So - they\u2019ve led for almost an hour, Fiji - but now the pressure is building. Can they hang on for this final 20? Both sides will begin to shuffle their packs - do they have the depth from the bench? 57 min: There was no collapsing that maul - it was a decent initial counterpush from Fiji, put Pocock and Sio spin off the side and it\u2019s the front-rower Latu who ends up over the line! A strong forward pack move from Australia, and they finally get their reward! It\u2019s gettable from Hodge - but he thumps the conversion attempt to the right. Two points left on the field? 56 min: Australia try the cross-field kick - but the fullback Murimurivalu cleans up. A talk to the Fijian captain as we come back for another advantage penalty - it\u2019s another case of collapsing the maul: next incident gets a yellow card is the word from the whistle-man, Ben O\u2019Keefe. 55 min: Australia look to spread wide, but there\u2019s a penalty against Fiji for collapsing the maul beforehand so we come back for the advantage. The Wallabies have a conference but decided to kick for touch. It worked last time - will they get the extra points this time? 53 min: Genia with a kick to the corner - and the 100+ cap half rolls on lovely ball into touch. Fiji lineout feed, which they win - but they\u2019ve knocked on! Big opportunity for Australia to push from a 5m lineout. 50 min: It\u2019s a change of kickers with Leali\u2019ifano perhaps carrying a slight leg knock, and Hodge smashes it over the black dot. An important three points for Australia to bring it back inside a converted try. And Cheika\u2019s seen enough - it\u2019s White off and Genia on for an early change in the halves. 48 min: It\u2019s a burst from Hooper! He\u2019s leading from the front, and that\u2019s great metres off the pop-pass from Leali\u2019ifano. They\u2019re about 10m out, Australia - but it\u2019s been turned over! The fullback gets it one-on-one from Latu, great strength, Murimurivalu. They kick to clear their line, Fiji. 46 min: They\u2019ve only had 30% of the possession so far, Fiji, but haven\u2019t they made the most of what they\u2019ve had. For all the talk of their lethal backs, their forward pack has been pretty solid today, as well, Fiji. Oh my, oh my. It\u2019s ball to ground in a pretty routine backline play - maybe some pressure from Fiji causing nerves in that area. And it\u2019s the big centre - Nayacalevu - who recovers and sprints away through the middle! Nobody can catch him, it\u2019s about a 60m dash. They were on the attack Australia, and they\u2019ve coughed it up. How costly! Volavola with the conversion from dead in front. A game-high 9pt lead for Fiji! 43 min: And now a penalty to the Wallabies as White is cleaned out illegally. Pocock with the turnover, he\u2019s started the half brightly. Great metres from Hodge with the kick for touch - they gain 40m or so. 41 min: It\u2019s pinched by Pocock - but he\u2019s been pinged by the Kiwi referee for not supporting his bodyweight in the steal. A tight one - he doesn\u2019t often get those wrong, the world\u2019s best pilferer. And we\u2019re back, and it\u2019s Australia who start with ball in hand. White with the kick-clearance from inside the 22. Fijian lineout just inside the Wallabies\u2019 half. Tweet in from Ben: It\u2019s a good point, Ben. There\u2019s been a fair bit on investment from world rugby into some of the so-called \u201ctier two\u201d nations in recent years - $60m and the investment behind a \u201cscrum factory\u201d to help develop forward play. A good yarn on this topic from last week - here\u2019s Ben Ryan on the topic for your half-time reading: So! A chance to catch breath. Your thoughts on that first half? Fiji looking so dangerous one-on-one and out wide, as you\u2019d suspect. Australia enjoying a little bit of superiority at the scrum and up through the middle. Ceri Griffiths has written in: At 24min that big last man tackle from Hodge on Yato looked an awful lot like a shoulder to the head! Should he even be on the field right now? It\u2019s an interesting question, Ceri - at first look I did wonder if he got the arms wrapped, the Australian winger, as he came across at pace. It was a big collision and it\u2019s a shame to see that Yato hasn\u2019t returned to the action. A fair talking point. And Volavola looks for touch - and that\u2019s the first half! Both sides head to the sheds to the applause of an appreciative crowd in Sapporo. What a half of rugby from Fiji: they go in ahead, can they repeat the dose after the break? 39 min: Another injury break as the big front rower Campese Ma\u2019afu receives some attention ahead of the scrum. He seems okay, thankfully. There\u2019s the gong for half-time. Love it - very Iron Chef. We set for a scrum though. 37 min: Rodda with the receive deep after Fiji restart. Australia look to spread again, but Koroibete almost runs out of real estate. Good run from O\u2019Connor who skips through one or two would-be tacklers. Kerevi tries to pump the legs, 10 phases from the Wallabies. But it\u2019s a knock on from White. Ach, a let off. 34 min: Hooper elects to go for touch! Big call from the captain - they\u2019ll need points here to justify this. Australia win the lineout, they set for the big push. Nakarawa almost turns it over, but the Wallabies retain. They\u2019re about 10m out - they swing to the edge.. and it\u2019s Hodge in the corner! Leali\u2019ifano from the touchline with the conversion attempt to level it - but he hooks it across the face. 32 min: Penalty against the Fijians this time. Australia kick to touch and Latu looks to feed in. Arnold rises and wins well. Gee, they\u2019re up quick on Leali\u2019ifano once again - he\u2019s having a torrid start to this one. We go back for a high tackle. Do they take the shot, Australia? It\u2019s about 40m out. A tricky one from Volavola but he just creeps it over. A good strike and an important three points - takes it out to a converted try lead. Some frustration creeping in for the Wallabies - you can hear players questioning the refereeing team on certain occasions. A tweet in from Andy: It\u2019s a terrific question. The Wallabies going wide early on on several occasions, and not getting any rewards from it. Maybe nerves? Peer pressure? 28 min: Good attacking momentum here, but they\u2019ve spilled in contact again, just 10m from the line, Fiji! Credit the defence, I guess, but a couple of loose carries letting themselves down. Samu Kerevi with a clearing kick - but we come back for a suspected high shot from Izack Rodda. 27 min: They go left Fiji, but it\u2019s good defence from Hodge once again and Botia spills the ball in the contact! Australia kick to clear their line but doesn\u2019t get much distance on it. Fijian lineout about 20m out. 26 min: Some concussion concern for Yato - that\u2019s a shame, what a start he\u2019s had. But he\u2019s replaced for a suspected head knock. What can they muster from the scrum, Fiji. We know how good their backs are - let\u2019s see what their forwards can come up with. 24 min: Fiji with a lineout feed and it\u2019s Yato bursting through - what a game he\u2019s having, he\u2019s broken the Australian line on at least three occasions already. Big last man tackle from Hodge - he may have saved a try there. And then it\u2019s Kerevi who picks up a spilled ball, but he\u2019s caught in his own in-goal area, and it\u2019s Fiji with an attacking scrum! They take the shot at goal from deep, and it just stays on line from Volavola. It really is an unusual kicking style - not Dan Biggar or Johnny Wilkinson prep-wise, just odd. I dunno - see if it\u2019s on Youtube somewhere. It gets the job done, though, and that\u2019s the main thing. 20 min: Fiji restart deep, Hooper receives (he\u2019s everywhere!) Advantage Australia as a Fijian player gets offside and prevents the distribution from White. They kick to touch and look to feed a lineout from just inside the Fijian half, but it\u2019s a terrific hit on Leali\u2019ifano and they cough up possession, Australia! Are they targeting the Wallabies\u2019 No 10, or is he just unlucky early on? this time it\u2019s Botia who collects the fly half. 17 min: Wallabies with a big push from the scrum - good opportunity here, they\u2019re just 10m out. They look to pick and carry, and there\u2019s a man in gold that\u2019s bustled over - it\u2019s the skipper! He\u2019s got through about three there from 5m out - plenty to do, but he stayed low and got there. Leali\u2019ifano converts from just off to the side. 15 min: Leali\u2019ifano sparks a move, but he\u2019s clattered and remains down as Australia look to spread wide. This is better from the Wallabies, but the force the last pass and it\u2019s turned over. They win the scrum feed after a small Fijian knock on. Leali\u2019ifano gets back to his feet, a little gingerly. 13 min: Relieving penalty for Australia from the scrum - they need to win some little battles, the Wallabies - it\u2019s been the Pasifika nation that\u2019s on the front foot over the first 10 or so minutes. 11 min: Penalty against Australia, as Koroibete gets isolated - the attack peters out. Fiji kick to touch and look to launch from a five-man lineout. It\u2019s a long feed, and they\u2019re straight on the attack, the Fijians. They look for Radradra with the crossfield kick and he rises above Hodge - but can\u2019t quite hold the regather! Nearly a second try! 10 min: Welly, well. If they didn\u2019t realise they were at the World Cup, the Wallabies - they do now. Ten of the fifteen in gold making their cup debuts today. You\u2019d imagine some settling words from Hooper. 7 min: Lovely bust! It\u2019s Tuisova with a huge bump down the wing - his opposite number brushed aside with consummate ease, and then with hardly any territory to work with they burst down the wing - Yato, backs up on the inside and scores in the corner! Volavola just hooks to the left with the conversion attempt. Game on! 6 min: Australia do well to regather from the short kick off, but they look to push wide and it\u2019s into touch as Beale fails to find his man on the wing. Fijian lineout. First blood! Out to the left of the posts but it\u2019s right over the black dot from Ben Volavola. A curious kicking style, but he gets it done. 3 min: A well-weighted kick to the corner by Fiji - and it will be an Australian lineout just 5m out from their own line. They win it, the men in gold - but Nakarawa isolates Nic White, and they\u2019ve conceded an early penalty, the Wallabies! 2 min: First look of Australia with the ball, but O\u2019Connor is turned over after a strong one-on-one tackle from Tuisova. A nervous moment for the Fijian winger a little later as Koroibete puts a kick in that he juggles, but it goes backwards. 1 min: It\u2019s the Wallabies who get us underway, and they kick deep. And there\u2019s a charge down! Dramatic start - Fiji recover the ball, just metres from their own line. We\u2019ve seen the Fijians rugby sevens gather with a song of praise - but it\u2019s the pre-game war dance for the 15s team. It\u2019s well received by the crowd, and the Australian team. A conflicted role for former Australian U20s assistant coach John McKee - Fiji\u2019s coach. But he\u2019s a professional, you\u2019d imagine. Three Fijian-born players in the Wallabies XV - Samu Kerevi, Marika Koroibete and Isi Naisarani. So emotions all round, you\u2019d think. Our players have had their dressing room huddles - and they\u2019ve just left the tunnel to a tremendous reception. What a crowd, what a stadium this looks! And now it\u2019s time for the anthems, Fiji first, then Australia. So without further ado - some team news: It feels an age since both David Pocock and Michael Hooper both started in gold for Australia, while for NRL fans, there\u2019s a pretty familiar name starting in the centres for Fiji. Australia: 15 Kurtley Beale, 14 Reece Hodge, 13 James O\u2019Connor, 12 Samu Kerevi, 11 Marika Koroibete, 10 Christian Lealiifano, 9 Nic White, 8 Isi Naisarani, 7 Michael Hooper (c), 6 David Pocock, 5 Rory Arnold, 4 Izack Rodda, 3 Allan Alaalatoa, 2 Tolu Latu, 1 Scott Sio. Bench: 16 Jordan Uelese, 17 James Slipper, 18 Sekope Kepu, 19 Adam Coleman, 20 Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, 21 Will Genia, 22 Matt To\u2019omua, 23 Dane Haylett-Petty. Fiji: 15 Kini Murimurivalu, 14 Josua Tuisova, 13 Waisea Nayacalevu, 12 Levani Botia, 11 Semi Radradra, 10 Ben Volavola, 9 Frank Lomani, 8 Viliame Mata, 7 Peceli Yato, 6 Dominiko Waqaniburotu (c), 5 Leone Nakarawa, 4 Tevita Cavubati, 3 Peni Ravai, 2 Samuel Matavesi, 1 Campese Ma\u2019afu. Bench: 16 Tuvere Vugakoto, 17 Eroni Mawi, 18 Manasa Saulo, 19 Tevita Ratuva, 20 Mosese Voka, 21 Nikola Matawalu, 22 Alivereti Veitokani, 23 Vereniki Goneva. As I noted in the preview, Australia have won the previous 11 clashes against Fiji - but with the last of those coming over two years ago it\u2019s uncertain how little of that history will matter today. They\u2019ve won their opening pool game on 7 of 8 occasions, Australia (spot quiz: can you remember the one they didn\u2019t?) - so it may very much depend upon whether Michael Cheika has got his troops in the right headspace. With the most experienced group at the entire WC (average caps / player) you\u2019d imagine Australia won\u2019t get \u201ccaught cold\u201d - but stranger things have happened. Fiji for their part come in on a three-game winning streak and their highest ever world ranking, so will be no pushovers. Afternoon/morning/evening all! From me to you, from wherever you\u2019re following our coverage today. I\u2019m not sure about you, but I have genuine butterflies in the stomach - not for any partisan reasons, but simply because it\u2019s the World Cup! The pinnacle of any sport\u2019s quadrennial calendar - the event that fuels the dreams that get players through every dreary morning training or gruelling injury recovery sessions. Australia v Fiji. No walk in the park for the Wallabies and what a test for the Pasifika nation. Ranked in the top ten - above nations such as Argentina that have troubled Australia. Your thoughts on this contest? Fire us an email or tweet to join the conversation here - this is a train that picks up all passengers. With a flurry of pomp and pageantry the Rugby World Cup is officially underway - and in pretty positive fashion for the home nation after their opening night triumph. For Australian and Fijian fans all eyes turn to game two - which outside of the massive NZ v South Africa blockbuster later today is surely one of the picks of the opening rounds. In theory, Australia should be strong favourites to win. That\u2019s certainly been the case the last eleven times these two nations have met, including twice previously at World Cup level. And yet. With Fiji one of the so-called \u201ctier two\u201d nations that\u2019s very much on the rise, packed with explosive individual talent, there\u2019s a lurking suspicion the powerhouses at rugby sevens level might just be ready to step up and make a huge statement in the 15-a-side game. It\u2019s a clash that has \u201cbanana skin\u201d written all over it - especially for a Wallabies side coming off hugely indifferent form over the past 18 months, despite the recent win over New Zealand. Whatever happens, it\u2019s likely to be fast, furious, and above all, hugely entertaining - so strap in and enjoy the ride!",

Bigger households could save even more by switching. So where should you be taking your energy business? After Eversmart Energy this month became the latest in a long line of suppliers to cease trading, we now discount firms that are new entrants or have poor customer service records.</p> <p>Avro Energy appears to have the standout fixed price tariff: its Simple and SuperSave deal costs a bit more than the cheapest tariff, at \u00a3891 a year, but insulates buyers against future price rises.</p> <p>The company has been around for a while and is rated as mid-table by Which? for customer service. Crucially, prices are fixed for 12 months and there are no exit fees, meaning you can switch out at any time in the unlikely event that prices fall again. Grab this soon, as it may not be around for ever.</p> <p>If you want a 100% green energy provider that has the added benefit of being a name, British Gas\u2019s Energy Plus Protection Green Oct 2020 tariff is the one to go for. At \u00a3983 a year, it is a bit pricier, but offers 100% renewable electricity and 100% carbon-offset gas. </p> <p>Crucially, prices are fixed until the end of October 2020. Note, buyers receive free central heating insurance for one year, which will automatically renew if you do not cancel it at the end of the period.</p> <p>MoneySavingExpert has a <a href=\"https://clubs.moneysavingexpert.com/cheapenergyclub/register?isCollectiveSwitchRegistration=true&amp;target=%2Fcheapenergyclub%2Fresults%3Fsort%3Dsuperb\" title=\"\">great green deal with Pure Planet</a> (\u00a3890 a year after cashback) but prices are pegged to wholesale costs, with all the risks that entails.</p> <p>Mark Todd, who runs the switching website Energyhelpline.com, said: \u201cI recommend a fixed-price deal so you are guaranteed not to get hit by price rises. A perk of autumn switching is that most energy accounts tend to be in credit at this time of year, as usage is lowest in the summer.</p> <p>\u201cSo, as well as saving a few hundred pounds from switching, you are likely to get a big refund from your existing supplier \u2013 often \u00a3200-\u00a3300.

      "bodyText": "The experts are in agreement: now is the moment to grab a new fixed-price gas and electricity tariff in time for the big central heating switch-on, in order to protect yourself against the chunky price hikes that appear to be heading our way. Uncertainty in the Middle East, concerns over French nuclear supplies, gas restrictions from Russia \u2013 and, dare we mention it, Brexit \u2013 all arguably add up to a situation where those who are free to switch gas and electricity supplier should probably do so now. On Monday, Craig Lowrey, a senior energy watcher at Cornwall Insight, warned consumers that prices looked destined to rise. \u201cAn increase in oil prices is likely to lead to a corresponding rise in gas and electricity prices, which will be reflected in higher tariffs for customers going forward, while existing fixed-price, fixed-duration tariffs may also be withdrawn,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prospect of an oil-led commodity price spike adds to the chance of market rises feeding into higher bills for customers at some stage.\u201d His forecast was immediately borne out, as EDF pulled a top deal later that day, meaning now is the time to act. An average household will spend about \u00a31,170 next year if they are currently on a capped standard gas and electricity tariff with one of the big six suppliers. However, tariffs that fix your gas and electricity prices for the next 12 months are currently available at \u00a3879 a year \u2013 a \u00a3291-a-year saving. Bigger households could save even more by switching. So where should you be taking your energy business? After Eversmart Energy this month became the latest in a long line of suppliers to cease trading, we now discount firms that are new entrants or have poor customer service records. Avro Energy appears to have the standout fixed price tariff: its Simple and SuperSave deal costs a bit more than the cheapest tariff, at \u00a3891 a year, but insulates buyers against future price rises. The company has been around for a while and is rated as mid-table by Which? for customer service. Crucially, prices are fixed for 12 months and there are no exit fees, meaning you can switch out at any time in the unlikely event that prices fall again. Grab this soon, as it may not be around for ever. If you want a 100% green energy provider that has the added benefit of being a name, British Gas\u2019s Energy Plus Protection Green Oct 2020 tariff is the one to go for. At \u00a3983 a year, it is a bit pricier, but offers 100% renewable electricity and 100% carbon-offset gas. Crucially, prices are fixed until the end of October 2020. Note, buyers receive free central heating insurance for one year, which will automatically renew if you do not cancel it at the end of the period. MoneySavingExpert has a great green deal with Pure Planet (\u00a3890 a year after cashback) but prices are pegged to wholesale costs, with all the risks that entails. Mark Todd, who runs the switching website Energyhelpline.com, said: \u201cI recommend a fixed-price deal so you are guaranteed not to get hit by price rises. A perk of autumn switching is that most energy accounts tend to be in credit at this time of year, as usage is lowest in the summer. \u201cSo, as well as saving a few hundred pounds from switching, you are likely to get a big refund from your existing supplier \u2013 often \u00a3200-\u00a3300. Energy is the easiest big bill to switch and can be done in minutes.\u201d \u2022 To find the right deal for your household, do a whole of market comparison at Energyhelpline.com. Ideally, input your previous year\u2019s usage figures to produce accurate results. You can opt for green or fixed deals and follow the link to switch supplier.",

To \u201cunlock\u201d them, you have to share a post promoting the show on Facebook or Twitter, and you can typically buy up to two tickets.</p> <p>Meanwhile, every week, 40 tickets for each performance of the London production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child the following week are released via TodayTix priced at \u00a340 (\u00a320 per part).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e5767dcecec80c5aadc665d3699da813bef27269\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5767dcecec80c5aadc665d3699da813bef27269/141_0_1986_2481/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ian McKellen on Stage\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eighty seats for each performance of Ian McKellen on Stage are on sale for \u00a310 each.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Rosser</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sign up for email alerts</strong></h2> <p>Assuming you don\u2019t mind the extra traffic into your inbox (maybe set up an email address specifically for this), you should sign up for as many ticket agency and theatre newsletters and alerts as possible. They often have details of decent discounts and offers. ATG Tickets and Delfont Mackintosh are just two of the biggies.</p> <h2><strong>The \u2018upper circle trick\u2019</strong></h2> <p>This is where you buy the cheapest tickets in the upper circle or balcony. Rich says: \u201cOn a quiet night the theatre will close them, and you will be promoted to the costlier seats downstairs. This works on less popular shows only, of course!\u201d</p> <p>Linked to this, it may be worth opting to pick up your tickets from the box office on the night rather than having them posted, as it is then easier for staff to upgrade you to better seats.</p> <h2><strong>Watch the sites like a hawk</strong></h2> <p>Many venues use dynamic pricing, where the cost of a ticket changes according to demand. Sometimes this means prices will drop at the last minute. If you have your eye on a show, check the ticket site(s) a day or two before a performance, and then from around 10am on the day. Sometimes bargains will pop up \u2013 unsold day seats, for example, or house seats originally held back for guests/VIPs etc.</p> <h2><strong>Sign up to an audience club or \u2018seat-filling\u2019 service</strong></h2> <p>There are a number of below-the-radar clubs whose job it is to build word-of-mouth buzz and ultimately make sure the actors are not gazing out at rows of empty seats. They do this by discreetly dishing out free or very cheap tickets, often at very short notice (for free tickets there is usually an admin charge). Once you have signed up, you will usually receive regular emails about shows. You will often need to act fast, and invariably you have to keep quiet about how you got your tickets. If you claim a free ticket, it\u2019s highly frowned-upon to then not turn up, and you are encouraged to show your support by maybe buying a drink or a programme.</p> <p>Leading clubs include <a href=\"https://www.showfilmfirst.com/\" title=\"\">ShowFilmFirst</a> and <a href=\"https://www.myboxoffice.biz/#\" title=\"\">My Box Office</a> (the latter charges a \u00a315 annual fee).

So at \u00a337.50 per seat, this two-seater \u2018box\u2019 gives you lots of space (as chairs are free-standing), privacy, a bit of exclusivity and a great view. So you have to lean over the rail a bit and can\u2019t see a tiny bit of the stage, but you are so close to the stage that it really doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 If I had a party of four, I would go for Boxes A/B or C/D, so all sat together, and for \u00a3150 in a totally private space, you will have a wonderful time!

      "bodyText": "You would like to go to the theatre more often, but you\u2019re put off by the exorbitant cost. Yes, tickets can be pricey, particularly for the big shows in the West End of London, but you don\u2019t have to pay \u00a375 or \u00a3100 (or more) \u2013 with a little insider knowledge, you can often get a decent seat for about \u00a310 to \u00a320. And then there are the hush-hush ways you can get free tickets for some shows. Here, we share some of the secrets of how to bag a bargain \u2013 or at least not pay massively over the odds. We also shine a spotlight on the seats that regular theatregoers don\u2019t want you to know about: the cheap \u201crestricted view\u201d ones that really aren\u2019t that restricted at all, and the good-value seats that don\u2019t seem to be on many people\u2019s radar. For example, there\u2019s the \u201croyal\u201d box at Hamilton that seats two people in comfort and allows you to practice your regal wave, smug in the knowledge that you have paid far less than most of the punters sitting in the stalls and dress circle. Then there\u2019s the leading theatre that lets you watch its shows for 10p. Meanwhile, there are the schemes that allow people who spread the word about certain shows on Twitter or Facebook to buy tickets at a fraction of the full price. Some of these tips and tricks are courtesy of Steve Rich, the founder of the website Theatremonkey.com, which features seat reviews and rounds up the latest cheap deals. Pricey seats mean cheap seats Top-end prices in the West End have risen by nearly a fifth in the space of a year, according to The Stage\u2019s most recent annual survey, and the best seats at Hamilton and The Phantom of the Opera now cost up to \u00a3250 apiece. But in many cases, these premium seats are subsidising much cheaper tickets aimed at bringing in new, younger audiences. In some cases, these cheap tickets are available to all; in others, they are restricted to certain groups. For example, with Ian McKellen on Stage, the actor\u2019s one-man show at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London that had its first performance last night and runs until 5 January, top-price seats cost up to \u00a3125. But at the same time there are 80 seats for \u00a310 at every show, including some in the stalls. Meanwhile, tickets went on sale this week for a new production of Cyrano de Bergerac starring James McAvoy that will run at the Playhouse Theatre in London from 27 November. While some seats cost \u00a3144.50 each, there will be 15,000 tickets at \u00a315 for key workers, under 30s and those receiving jobseeker\u2019s allowance or other benefits, plus 15,000 free tickets for first-time theatregoers. The first release of the \u00a315 seats will be on 4 November at 12pm via the ATG Tickets website. Here are some of the other notable schemes: \u2022 Bristol Old Vic\u2019s text message-based \u201cArts Ping\u201d scheme, for students at the city\u2019s two main universities, lets people nab last-minute seats for as little as \u00a35. \u2022 At Manchester Royal Exchange, students and people under 26 can get tickets costing \u00a37 for any main house weekday show \u2013 a saving of up to 80% on the full price. This offer applies to its current production of Macbeth, which opened this week, plus upcoming shows such as Gypsy. \u2022 The Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon runs the \u201cRSC Key\u201d scheme offering \u00a35 tickets if you are 16 to 25, plus a \u00a310 \u201cFirst Time Friday\u201d deal. \u2022 With the \u201cPwC \u00a310 Previews\u201d at the Old Vic in London, five weeks before the first preview of a show, the theatre releases at least half the seats for \u00a310 for the first five performances. No age limit. \u2022 National Theatre of Scotland\u2019s Futureproof Passport programme allows those aged 14 to 26 to sign up for \u00a35 tickets. \u2022 Young+Free at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden, London, offers free tickets by ballot to those aged 16 to 25. \u2022 The National Theatre\u2019s Friday Rush where, every Friday at 1pm, \u00a320 tickets for shows in all three theatres at the London complex the following week go on sale. All ages. \u2022 Birmingham Rep\u2019s Preview Club for 16- to 30-year-olds, which offers \u00a35 preview tickets. Sign up to TodayTix in London Billed as \u201cUber for theatre tickets\u201d, this app has become hugely popular. TodayTix offers tickets to dozens of West End and fringe shows at savings of up to 70%-plus. Shows currently featured range from 9 to 5 the Musical at the Savoy Theatre to A Very Expensive Poison at the Old Vic. You can also enter lotteries to win \u00a320 front-row tickets to shows such as Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie. In addition, TodayTix allows people who spread the word about shows to buy heavily discounted \u201cRush\u201d tickets: for example, you pay \u00a325 in the case of the musicals Fiddler on the Roof, Waitress, Six and Come From Away, and \u00a325 and \u00a315 respectively for the plays The Night of the Iguana and The Son.

He informed officers he had been having sex with a minor and had potentially given him a sexually transmitted infection. The minor, a 12-year-old boy, confirmed the details of the abuse and rape to police officers in February 2017.</p> \n<p>Despite the age of the victim, which meant the case was a matter of statutory rape with no defence of \u201cmistaken reasonable belief\u201d, and the admission by the perpetrator, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said a review of the boy\u2019s phone was required for a charging decision to be made. Among the data the Met\u2019s specialist unit were instructed to extract and review were 40,000 messages from the boy\u2019s phone.</p> \n<p>The boy\u2019s family instructed lawyers at the beginning of 2018 when they became frustrated by the failure to promptly charge and prosecute the perpetrator. The boy\u2019s lawyers repeatedly asked the CPS and the Met why an extensive review of 40,000 files of personal data was required for a charging decision to be made. In June 2018, the CPS maintained that charges would not be pressed until police had reviewed the data on the minor\u2019s phone. Days later, the Met informed the boy\u2019s lawyers that his phone was still three to four months away from being examined as \u201cpost-charge cases take priority\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe response demonstrated the incongruous situation that many victims of serious crimes, like our client, may find themselves in. On the one hand, our client was told by the CPS that an unlawful electronic review of his personal data had to take place prior to a charging decision, but on the other hand the police force responsible for such a review admitted that they prioritised reviews of electronic data only in cases where a charge had been made,\u201d Rachel Harger, a solicitor at Bindmans LLP, says.</p> \n<p>Following a pre-action letter for judicial review, a charging decision was made, almost a year and a half after the incident had been reported. The perpetrator was convicted on 20 September 2018 after he pleaded guilty to offences, which included rape, attempted rape and sexual touching of a child under 13. <strong>Aamna Mohdin</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9e4dde84-a054-4276-b74f-c3c0d5e247dd\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Police guidance states that when investigating a crime: \"Mobile phones and other digital devices such as laptop computers, tablets and smart watches can provide important relevant information and help us investigate what happened.

She\u2019ll screenshot me the emails and we\u2019ll just go: \u2018Wow!\u2019 Because those people were not returning her emails at the beginning of this year, I\u2019ll tell you that!\u201d</p> <p>Sadly for us in the UK, this is all too little, too late. By the time you read this, 30-year-old Hughes will be in Los Angeles working with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/13/issa-rae-interview-insecure-little\">Issa Rae</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/07/insecure-review-hbo-issa-rae\">Insecure</a> co-creator, Larry Wilmore, on the pilot for a sitcom based on her own life. She cannot say much yet, but what she does say is: \u201cI wanna bring black British culture to America; the positive side to black British culture, none of this Top Boy stuff.\u201d</p> <p>It has only been three years since Hughes first crossed the Atlantic, but things have moved fast. \u201cI feel like something shifted over there and black women\u2019s stories are wanted now. People like Issa Rae and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/07/tiffany-haddish-if-meryl-streep-can-go-to-the-oscars-22-times-why-cant-i\">Tiffany Haddish</a> opened the doors for me, so I can easily walk through.\u201d Over here, however, she has felt stigmatised by her association with kids\u2019 TV (she was a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00922mx\">CBBC presenter</a> from 2009 to 2011) and overlooked in favour of her pale, male peers. \u201cI\u2019m definitely riding the wave in America. Here, there\u2019s no wave. Like the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/08/michaela-cole-enjoy-making-people-uncomfortable-chewing-gum-season-two\">Michaela Coel</a> had a whole two seasons of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/04/michaela-coel-chewing-gum-e4-comedy-series-men-and-sex\">Chewing Gum</a> and then it ended and none of you thought: maybe we should replace this? But everyone\u2019s looking for the next <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/08/farewell-fleabag-the-most-electrifying-devastating-tv-in-years\">Fleabag</a>! OK. There\u2019s no wave.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2699b519aecccd47e4790c106ec3849968eef740\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2699b519aecccd47e4790c106ec3849968eef740/1835_1137_4885_2931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London Hughes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>While it sounds as though Hughes\u2019s heart has irrevocably hardened as far as the British comedy establishment is concerned, she was sincerely moved by her Edinburgh nomination. \u201cI literally fell to the floor. It just meant validation. It was like: \u2018You\u2019re not crazy.\u2019 The whole of my career I\u2019ve been told: \u2018No, not right for us\u2019; \u2018Oh no, we like London, but we don\u2019t think she\u2019s right\u2019; \u2018Oh she\u2019s not right \u2026 \u2019 Never, never, never, never been accepted. Not in this industry, not in this lifetime. And, for the first time, I finally felt accepted \u2026 It will for ever be the best day of my life.\u201d</p> <p>So, although the award eventually went to another comedian, Jordan Brookes, for Hughes it was mission accomplished: \u201cMy whole thing about Edinburgh was, basically \u2013 it sounds so big-headed, but it\u2019s the truth \u2013 I was like, make them realise they messed up. Go to Edinburgh one more time, kill it and then leave. To let them know, you can\u2019t keep doing this to your black talent. You just can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>She has no regrets about moving on from British comedy. She knows it is not her fault (\u201cIt\u2019s literally, systemically, their problem\u201d), yet the rejection still stings. \u201cBecause it\u2019s my home! It\u2019s my people,\u201d she says, sounding genuinely pained. \u201cI wanted to make it here first, but I just knew \u2013 I just knew \u2013 as a black woman, I wouldn\u2019t. There are no black female household names in this country, bar Naomi Campbell.\u201d</p> <p>Success has been a long time coming for London Hughes, especially when you consider how early she started. Her name was bestowed before birth. She was a \u201cmiracle baby\u201d \u2013 her parents were not sure she would survive long outside the womb \u2013 so they went all out and gave her six middle names, with London being the least unusual option. \u201cMy mum wanted to call me Nashwan which was the name of the horse that won the Derby that day and Sonar, after the sonar treatment they used to save my life. So \u2026 \u201d Otherwise, she had what she calls \u201ca normal black British girl experience\u201d growing up in Thornton Heath, south London, the same area as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/29/stormzy-historic-glastonbury-performance\">Stormzy</a>. \u201cMy parents worked really hard and my story is not different from anybody else\u2019s. I\u2019m not from a gang, I\u2019m not from a council estate, but I\u2019m not wealthy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"940007d82653f3e09e65cf1706b38b74b5af7531\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/940007d82653f3e09e65cf1706b38b74b5af7531/0_321_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>She gets her stage presence and glamorous style from her mother. \u201cI\u2019m, like, Jamaican culture: we show out,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I was going to church my mum would make sure I looked legit for God. So now I\u2019m a comedian on stage, do you think I\u2019m gonna do it in jeans and a top? Never!\u201d Her humour, she reckons, comes more from her dad, who grew up in Sussex, the black son of white adoptive parents. \u201cMy grandma, God rest her soul, was a very woke woman \u2013 like, she got me black Barbie dolls, and was very cultured, for someone who had no black friends and whose own mother had a cat called \u2018Nigger\u2019 \u2026 So my dad is a very proud black man, but he grew up on Radio 4 shows and I used to listen to them, too. No black girl from south London, at six years old, should be able to quote Round the Horn and The Goon Show, but I could. So for real, like, you cannot put me in a box!\u201d</p> <p>That box, and Hughes\u2019s refusal to get in it, also helps explain the twists and turns of her showbiz journey. \u201cSometimes, I feel like I\u2019m not black enough for TV, because I\u2019m not urban \u2026 If I had The London Hughes Show, there\u2019d be no graffiti backgrounds, there\u2019d be no \u2018Nursery Grimes\u2019,\u201d she says, presumably in reference to Channel 4\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/12/mo-gilligan-the-comedian-on-viral-videos-to-chatshow-host\">The Lateish Show With Mo Gilligan</a>. \u201cIt would just be a show hosted by a woman who happens to be black. I would probably reference my blackness, but it wouldn\u2019t be in a way of: \u201cOh yeah, let me just basically play a racial stereotype.\u201d Like, cool, have shows like that, but then also, have other shows. If you didn\u2019t have any black friends, you lived in Brexit Britain and you looked on TV, you\u2019d think we are all grime rappers.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, there is only one point in our interview when the supremely confident Hughes looks uncomfortable, and that\u2019s when she opens up about her own teenage rap alter-ego, Lady Diamond. Why so cringy? \u201cMy mum had just moved us to Brighton and that\u2019s when I felt like I needed to hold on to my blackness the most, because I was surrounded by white people, so, I became a rapper. I had these song lyrics like, \u2018Brap, brap, brap, come to your house \u2026 \u2018 Like, what am I \u2018brapping\u2019? There\u2019s nothing to \u2018brap\u2019! I will not come to your house, I don\u2019t own a gun, I\u2019ve never even seen a gun! So that was annoying because I was holding on to something that wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbHq4YVfSrs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BbHq4YVfSrs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>No one who has caught Hughes on Don\u2019t Hate the Playaz will be surprised to learn that she still finds inspiration in hip-hop and feels a particular sense of kinship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2019/aug/27/good-as-hell-why-lizzo-is-the-feel-good-superstar-everyone-needs\">Lizzo</a>: \u201cShe\u2019s been going for 10 years; I\u2019ve been going for 10 years. Two years ago she released Truth Hurts; two years ago I was in Edinburgh doing my comedy and nobody cared. Two years later, Truth Hurts goes to No 1; two years later, I get nominated for a comedy award. And we\u2019re both 30. Everything about her is me.\u201d It was also during the Lady Diamond years that Hughes had her first kiss \u2013 with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/24/wiley-godfather-grime\">Godfather of Grime, Wiley</a>, no less (\u201cGreat kisser! I don\u2019t think he even knows who I am\u201d), and threw an 18th birthday party attended by future Channel 4 talkshow host <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/11/im-not-a-token-black-guy-a-day-in-the-life-of-big-narstie-and-his-mum\">Big Narstie</a> (\u201cSo, basically I joined MySpace because I wanted rappers to date me \u2026 And it worked!\u201d).</p> <p>Because she\u2019s London Hughes, her Wiley name-drop is quickly followed by a lively anecdote about the time Prince Charles told her she was too pretty to be a comic. \u201cPrince Charles walked in the room, just oozing sex appeal, with all the badges on. I\u2019m like, \u2018Yaaaasss, Prince! Yaaaaasss!\u2019 I\u2019m the only black girl in the whole room, he makes a beeline for me, cos we know Prince Charles likes black girls ... \u201d Wiley and Prince Charles? It\u2019s a juxtaposition that amuses Hughes, too: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! Get you a chick that can do both. Round the Horn and twerking!\u201d Yet even as Hughes was mixing in such exulted MySpace circles, and building the bulletproof ego that still powers her performances, she was being bullied; first at school and then by female \u201cfriends\u201d at university. \u201cI thought I was the problem and they kept telling me I was the problem. So growing up I felt I had to be like: \u2018Please like me!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Now, she is keen to build more mutually supportive relationships with other women. \u201cLike, I am amazing, but also my amazingness does not take away from yours. That\u2019s what women need to learn,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially in this industry \u2026 I just wish that there was more of a sisterhood when it comes to females in general, and way more of a sisterhood when it comes to black females \u2026 That\u2019s why I always big-up Thanyia Moore or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/29/lolly-adefope-first-trip-to-edinburgh-fringe-comedy-summer\">Lolly Adefope</a>: I haven\u2019t been in a room with Lolly Adefope for years, but I will always talk about her and how proud I am of her. Or Michaela Coel. I don\u2019t chat to Michaela Coel, but I will celebrate her.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes rarely lets her inner people-pleaser get a word in these days, but she does acknowledge the crucial part it played in her development as a comic. One of the thrills of seeing her live is the sense that she never weighs her words or regrets something she has said, however scandalous. And it\u2019s no stage illusion: \u201cNow, I\u2019m this age, I\u2019m like, I\u2019m a queen! Do I like me? Yes, I do, and that\u2019s where the \u2018no-filter\u2019 thing came from. I\u2019m not a nasty person, but I\u2019m free with my mouth and I say what I want and if you don\u2019t like that, fine.\u201d</p> <p>And if you do like that? Better get in there quick. That\u2019s the sound of London Hughes not calling us back: \u201cI want my own sitcom. If you can\u2019t give me that, then don\u2019t ring my phone. I\u2019m in America.\u201d</p> <p><em>Don\u2019t Hate the Playaz is on Wednesdays, 10pm, ITV2</em></p>",

At this year\u2019s Edinburgh festival fringe, her sold-out, roof-raising show To Catch a Dick narrowly missed out on the big prize, making her the first black British woman to be nominated. In Atlanta, Georgia, she recently did a standup gig for an African-American crowd which received the besotted-yet-bemused heckle: \u201cWhat part of \u2018black\u2019 you from?\u201d Meanwhile, back in her home town and namesake, she is continuing her regular gig on ITV2\u2019s panel show, Don\u2019t Hate the Playaz, starting her new Spotify dating podcast, London Actually, and kicking up a Top Boy-related Twitterstorm about black representation (\u201cBlack British culture is not is not just one way, there\u2019s more to us than grime and gangs and knife crime,\u201d she tweeted). The offers are pouring in so fast \u2013 gigs, book deals, merchandising \u2013 that all she can do is laugh: \u201cGod, you should see my agent\u2019s emails; it\u2019s, like, ridiculous!

I don\u2019t think he even knows who I am\u201d), and threw an 18th birthday party attended by future Channel 4 talkshow host Big Narstie (\u201cSo, basically I joined MySpace because I wanted rappers to date me \u2026 And it worked!\u201d). Because she\u2019s London Hughes, her Wiley name-drop is quickly followed by a lively anecdote about the time Prince Charles told her she was too pretty to be a comic. \u201cPrince Charles walked in the room, just oozing sex appeal, with all the badges on. I\u2019m like, \u2018Yaaaasss, Prince! Yaaaaasss!\u2019 I\u2019m the only black girl in the whole room, he makes a beeline for me, cos we know Prince Charles likes black girls ... \u201d Wiley and Prince Charles? It\u2019s a juxtaposition that amuses Hughes, too: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! Get you a chick that can do both. Round the Horn and twerking!\u201d Yet even as Hughes was mixing in such exulted MySpace circles, and building the bulletproof ego that still powers her performances, she was being bullied; first at school and then by female \u201cfriends\u201d at university. \u201cI thought I was the problem and they kept telling me I was the problem. So growing up I felt I had to be like: \u2018Please like me!\u2019\u201d Now, she is keen to build more mutually supportive relationships with other women. \u201cLike, I am amazing, but also my amazingness does not take away from yours. That\u2019s what women need to learn,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially in this industry \u2026 I just wish that there was more of a sisterhood when it comes to females in general, and way more of a sisterhood when it comes to black females \u2026 That\u2019s why I always big-up Thanyia Moore or Lolly Adefope: I haven\u2019t been in a room with Lolly Adefope for years, but I will always talk about her and how proud I am of her. Or Michaela Coel. I don\u2019t chat to Michaela Coel, but I will celebrate her.\u201d Hughes rarely lets her inner people-pleaser get a word in these days, but she does acknowledge the crucial part it played in her development as a comic. One of the thrills of seeing her live is the sense that she never weighs her words or regrets something she has said, however scandalous. And it\u2019s no stage illusion: \u201cNow, I\u2019m this age, I\u2019m like, I\u2019m a queen! Do I like me? Yes, I do, and that\u2019s where the \u2018no-filter\u2019 thing came from. I\u2019m not a nasty person, but I\u2019m free with my mouth and I say what I want and if you don\u2019t like that, fine.\u201d And if you do like that? Better get in there quick. That\u2019s the sound of London Hughes not calling us back: \u201cI want my own sitcom. If you can\u2019t give me that, then don\u2019t ring my phone. I\u2019m in America.\u201d Don\u2019t Hate the Playaz is on Wednesdays, 10pm, ITV2",

      "body": "<h2>A fisherman\u2019s hut in the Dordogne</h2> <p><strong>Kate Humble, TV presenter and author</strong></p> <p>I\u2019d been having cabin fantasies \u2013 I wanted to go off-grid, swim in a river, eat tomatoes and read books. I wanted to be Huckleberry Finn. We booked a rural place in the north of the Dordogne, did lots of walking and as it was <em>cep</em> (porcini) season, the local market was full of delicious mushrooms. Most visitors to France buy wine and some cheese to take home, but by the end of the week we\u2019d found some land nearby for sale, with a little fisherman\u2019s hut by a lake, surrounded by trees. This was almost 10 years ago, and the two-room cabin is now our little piece of eco-heaven.</p> <p>We used clay and straw to plaster the inside, and the wood for the staircase and the handcut chestnut roof shingles came from our land or our neighbour\u2019s. It has a kitchen-living area, a bedroom under the eves, a terrace and a composting loo, but no telly or phone signal. There\u2019s a shower with a solar pump connected to the lake \u2013 but my favourite way of washing there is to heat a kettle on the woodburner and have a bucket shower.</p> <p>We go a couple of times a year, paddling on a raft and swimming, surrounded by kingfishers, swallows and dragonflies, with the sound of frogs in the evening. I once spent a month trying to spot a black woodpecker, which I saw fleetingly while running with my dog. You can feel like Henry David Thoreau on Walden Pond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b5eb5c444a994949ff4e423733db6de2eb96776b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5eb5c444a994949ff4e423733db6de2eb96776b/0_367_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poacher\u2019s Cabin, Dordogne, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pond at the Poacher\u2019s Cabin</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Canopy &amp; Stars</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For campervan drivers in France, there\u2019s a system called <a href=\"https://www.france-passion.com/en/\" title=\"\">France Passion</a> . Membership costs \u20ac28 and includes a directory of places where you can stay for free for 24 hours. Some have a farm shop, so you can buy, say, some cider in return.</p> <p>My favourite thing is the night walk (about \u20ac12) from Busserolles village, which usually happens in July. About 300 people of all ages meet at 7pm to take one of two routes (8km or 12km). After a few kilometres, you convene in a field where there are lots of bottles of wine and little <em>amuse-bouches</em>. Further on, another field has rows of trestle tables for the main course \u2013 perhaps a huge bowl of bean soup with bread and cheese \u2013 by which time it\u2019s dark and most people are a bit drunk. Back in the village there\u2019s coffee and eclairs or sticky buns and a disco in the square. It\u2019s a lovely community event that brings everyone together on the level that walking does. I\u2019m researching a book about living simply, so in November I\u2019m going to be an intern at the Earthship. It was started by architect Michael Reynolds, in Taos, New Mexico, who builds autonomous buildings made of 50% rubbish, designed to regulate temperature, recycle water, and have space to grow food. The book is about how to live happily with a lighter footprint on the planet. There\u2019s no blanket solution but it\u2019s about balance and consciousness, and as a global community, we\u2019re all culpable.<br><em>\u2022 Poacher\u2019s Cabin sleeps two and is available to rent from <a href=\"https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/france/aquitaine/dordogne/poacher-s-cabin/poacher-s-cabin\" title=\"\">Canopy &amp; Stars</a> (\u00a390 a night)</em></p> <h2>East of England boat and road trip</h2> <p><strong>Craig Bennett</strong><strong>, CEO, <a href=\"https://friendsoftheearth.uk/\" title=\"\">Friends of the Earth</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d909a9fa80161270e1350ebb8872fe2ff3caea91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d909a9fa80161270e1350ebb8872fe2ff3caea91/0_313_4765_2859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alnmouth village and the Aln Estuary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alnmouth village and the Aln Estuary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the most important things to do on holiday is to disconnect from the outside world. No TV, no newspapers or looking at phones too much. When we visited the Norfolk Broads a few years ago, it was fantastic for going offline. Our children are 12 and 14, and it was the youngest who suggested it again for this year. Spending time as a family with the dogs on a boat with a top speed of about six miles an hour really makes you slow down.</p> <p>We picked up the boat in Stalham, cruised past Yarmouth to Beccles and Lowestoft then back up via Reedham. We did a few nights of wild moorings, under beautiful dark skies, and saw an otter or two, herons and lots of other wildlife. It\u2019s a different experience from other ways of travelling around the UK \u2013 arriving at little villages by water, taking a walk to seek out a teashop, or into a pub for dinner. We loved the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theferryinnstokesby/\" title=\"\">Ferry Inn</a> in Stokesby and the <a href=\"http://www.risingsuncoltishall.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Rising Sun</a> in Coltishall, both with overnight moorings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"69579842ce9d5e298553d2cb15dc12b5eadb93b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69579842ce9d5e298553d2cb15dc12b5eadb93b1/0_241_1599_959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Craig Bennett and his labrador in Northumberland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craig Bennett in Northumberland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Bennett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We then drove up the east coast to Northumberland and stayed in a cottage on a farm near Alnmouth. I had my first family holiday in the village when I was 13 and I\u2019d often pass it on the train to Edinburgh, and thought I\u2019d like to return.</p> <p>We spent half a day at <a href=\"https://friendsoftheearth.uk/latest/druridge-bay\" title=\"\">Druridge Bay</a>, just south of Amble. Friends of the Earth have been fighting against a proposal for a new opencast coal mine on this unspoiled coastal stretch. Tourism has brought in \u00a31bn for the region, but the proposal could end the very reason people visit these parts. The Northumberland coast is extraordinary, with beautiful sand dunes and hardly anyone there. We had a lot of long walks on dog-friendly beaches, made \u201cwater worlds\u201d in the sand, and caught a whiff of smoky kippers in Craster.</p> <p>People will often talk about holidays in the UK as a \u201cstaycation\u201d but I find that odd. When I was growing up, the normal thing was to holiday in the UK \u2013 it\u2019s how I got to know the country I live in, an experience I want my children to have too.<br></p> <h2>Italy by train</h2> <p><strong>Emma Kemp, campaigner, 10:10 Climate Action, leader of its <a href=\"https://www.climateperks.com/\" title=\"\">Climate Perks</a> initiative </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57fc3a4f6bfd7ddf0016bb011c22ab133f9ff05b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57fc3a4f6bfd7ddf0016bb011c22ab133f9ff05b/0_180_5405_3243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street in the centre of Naples.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street in the centre of Naples.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ArtMarie/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following a breakup, I decided to travel solo around Italy for two-and-a-half weeks in the hope of filling myself with Italian veggie food, sunny weather and Roman history. It was my first time travelling alone and the days before I left were speckled with excitement over my new-found independence, as well as nerves.</p> <p>I was stunned by the views from the train between Paris and Turin, through mountains and little villages. After a day spent cycling along the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2013/sep/05/river-po-cycle-path-in-pictures\" title=\"\">riverbank</a> and eating amazing local raspberry and almond granita, it was on to the Cinque Terre, where fresh pesto in Vernazza was a highlight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"42ca35443a42556266e017f4820d9b95760aa2a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42ca35443a42556266e017f4820d9b95760aa2a0/0_265_1337_1337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Kemp on the ferry to the Cinque Terre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Kemp on the ferry to the Cinque Terre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma Kemp</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next, an overnight train took me to Puglia, the heel of Italy\u2019s boot. I adored the whole region: Lecce is all baroque architecture, and in Ostuni I feasted on regional beetroot and turnip-top soup and truffle pasta with wild mushrooms. A lot of the traditional food in this region is vegetarian, because meat was once unaffordable for most.</p> <p>Everyone told me the same thing about Naples: that you cry twice. Once when you arrive and again when you leave. I was surprised by how much this rang true. When I got off the coach it was a shock after clean, quaint Lecce, but I fell in love while wandering the city\u2019s streets and eating deep-fried pizza.</p> <p>After day trips to the Amalfi coast, Pompeii and Paestum \u2013 said to be the birthplace of mozzarella \u2013 I took a sleeper train to Sicily, which goes on the ferry to cross the Strait of Messina. Syracuse has an amazing archeological park, with both Greek and Roman ruins and, 15km south, a flawless beach called Fontane Bianche. Later in the trip I passed through Siena \u2013 stumbling on a vegan dessert shop during the busy horse race celebrations \u2013 and spent a rainy day in Venice.</p> <p>Going by train allowed me to rediscover the magic of travel, and although it was more expensive than flying, it didn\u2019t break the bank.<br></p> <h2><strong>New Forest wildlife walk</strong></h2> <p><strong>Neil Ansell, author </strong><strong>of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/last-wilderness-610241.html\" title=\"\">The Last Wilderness: A Journey into Silence</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d028a20c5e5c90a8670040af2df7a93e60b3243f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d028a20c5e5c90a8670040af2df7a93e60b3243f/0_268_3780_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dartford warbler in the New Forest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dartford warbler in the New Forest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year I made a conscious choice to stay close to home, using public transport to visit a place where I spent a lot of my childhood \u2013 the New Forest in Hampshire. The forest has some spectacular ancient woodland but also wide expanses of lowland heath which is great for wildlife but a globally threatened habitat. I took advantage of fine weather with an exposed heathland walk on Hampton Ridge in the north of the forest. From the bus stop in Fordingbridge, I walked two miles along country lanes to the hamlet of Frogham, where there is a pub, the <a href=\"https://the.littlepubgroup.co.uk/the-foresters-arms\" title=\"\">Foresters Arms</a>. Beside this is <a href=\"http://www.newforestcampsite.com/\" title=\"\">Harry\u2019s Field</a> for camping, open only for summer weekends.</p> <p>The trail leads up onto a high gravel ridge with long views north and south over heathland flushed purple with heather. It looked just as I remembered it from my last visit, way back in the 1970s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"02e66ef9576d3f47bbd902e95663cb93e84140a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02e66ef9576d3f47bbd902e95663cb93e84140a1/0_938_1980_1188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Ansell at Hampton Ridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Ansell at Hampton Ridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Ansell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The place is tranquil now, but it was not always so; in the 1940s it was part of a bombing range. There are still a few traces that remain, including a slightly alarming 30-metre concrete arrow, a directional marker for bombers.</p> <p>Beside the ever-present buzzards, there is a chance to see other birds of prey, including goshawks, hobbies and even honey buzzards; and in the gorse brakes along the ridge-line trail, there are stonechats and Dartford warblers, only found on lowland heath.</p> <p>At the end of the ridge, the trail leads left into the isolated Pitts Wood Inclosure, known for woodpeckers, crossbills, and hawfinches. I saw both roe and fallow deer too, fawns in tow, and by staying until dark, was able to watch the mysterious nightjar.</p> <p>From the wood, the path heads up Cockley Hill to the village of Godshill and the <a href=\"http://fightingcockspub.com/\" title=\"\">Fighting Cocks pub</a>. I usually camp in the area; there are 40 campsites scattered around the forest, such as <a href=\"https://www.campingintheforest.co.uk/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_content=longbeech&amp;utm_campaign=google_places\" title=\"\">Longbeech</a> close to this trail, where I\u2019ve stayed before. The walk, from roadhead to roadhead, could be managed in two or three hours, but it\u2019s better to make a day of it, or stay overnight, and just wander and soak up the atmosphere.</p> <h2><strong>Dartmoor </strong><strong>eco-retreat</strong></h2> <p><strong>Donnachadh McCarthy, co-founder of <a href=\"http://stopkillingcyclists.org/\" title=\"\">Stop Killing Cyclists</a> and author of <a href=\"http://www.lulu.com/shop/donnachadh-mccarthy/the-prostitute-state-how-britains-democracy-has-been-bought/ebook/product-21827747.html\" title=\"\">The Prostitute State \u2013 How Our Democracy Has Been Bought</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7886d38a60eff60c25cd9d18bba42260a66636c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7886d38a60eff60c25cd9d18bba42260a66636c9/0_0_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rewilding Consciousness Retreat at Embercombe Centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rewilding Consciousness retreat at Embercombe Centre</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I usually seek out a rural UK eco-retreat for a holiday, and this year headed to the <a href=\"https://embercombe.org/rewilding-consciousness/\" title=\"\">Rewilding Consciousness</a> retreat at the Embercombe Centre near Dartmoor. I travelled by fold-up bike to the station, took a train to Exeter, then cycled to Embercombe \u2013 a hilly but pleasingly low-traffic ride. The great thing about a bike is that if you have to push it uphill, you have fun free-wheeling down the other side.</p> <p>Halfway there, the heavens opened, turning the roads into raging muddy torrents. I got soaked, but this was warm summer rain so felt like a hilarious adventure. Rolling up to reception, I stood in silence looking at the valley below and felt a sense of achievement in getting there without motor transport.</p> <p>Accommodation was in little yurt villages, with woodburners and composting loos among trees laden with ripe fruit. The wind in the woodland whispered gently, and roared in a glorious storm one evening. Embercombe also has a lake called Tree Mirror, which is great for swimming.</p> <p>The course taught us to open our ears and eyes to nature and reconnect to it in a way that we have lost in our busy tech-based lives. On the final evening, I slipped out to the stone circle to spend the night in my sleeping bag under the full moon. By the end of a week without my phone, my soul felt recharged. Investing in such \u201choly-days\u201d heals our hearts and minds.</p> <h2>Sussex countryside</h2> <p><strong>Roger Hallam, co-founder of <a href=\"https://rebellion.earth/\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bee36d64294dedc8a070c4c0a654e812e5d7566c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bee36d64294dedc8a070c4c0a654e812e5d7566c/0_233_5713_3428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A family walks along the top of the South Downs escarpment in Sussex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A family walks along the top of the South Downs escarpment in Sussex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the under-reported things about Extinction Rebellion (XR) is that it\u2019s developing into a really close community. A lot of people who felt isolated in their horror at the climate emergency suddenly find all these other compassionate, dedicated people who feel the same, so there\u2019s an immediate connection. Naturally, people get to know each other and travel to see one another for talks and events. More than once I\u2019ve rung someone in the organisation and they\u2019ve helped me find somewhere to stay.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been very busy this year, and didn\u2019t have much planned for the summer. I was asked to talk at <a href=\"https://www.bylinefestival.com/\" title=\"\">Byline Festival</a> in East Sussex [which helps promote independent journalism], so decided to have a holiday in the area too. I phoned an XR friend in Brighton and asked if she knew of anyone with a bit of land to camp on but it turned out her family home was in the countryside near Pulborough, and she let us borrow it.</p> <p>We mostly relaxed at the house but did go to the local village fete in Rackham one day. But my thing is cooking. I\u2019m an organic farmer (although I\u2019m now mainly based in the XR London office), so I brought enough veg from the farm in Wales to last us the week. We had a vegan sausage barbecue, and there were apples, plums and blackberries growing onsite to make a pie from. The South Downs was great for long walks \u2013 it\u2019s about as wild as southern England gets.</p> <p>I often travel around the UK, but I don\u2019t take many holidays. There\u2019s definitely a balance that we\u2019re all trying to negotiate, and the two big lifestyle issues are flying and meat. My feeling is that we are on the verge of a major change in social attitudes.</p> <h2><strong>Transylvania\u2019s \u2018hidden village\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nicoleta Carpineanu, founder of <a href=\"https://www.forestswithoutfrontiers.org/\" title=\"\">Forests Without Frontiers</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eddf60bdd141febdc788ba2e8a3f0b6f04391f85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eddf60bdd141febdc788ba2e8a3f0b6f04391f85/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holbav in Transylvania, autumn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Transylvania in autumn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Janoka82/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I live in Brighton but one of my favourite places to go on holiday is Transylvania, where I\u2019m from.

I\u2019ll take the ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe, stopping off at Mont Ventoux in Provence for the not-insignificant challenge of cycling up the mountain from three different approaches in one day. So my summer has been a series of weekend training trips in the UK, visiting places I love or have never been to.</p> <p>Abergavenny falls into the latter group. The Tumble, a famous climb at the edge of the Brecon Beacons, was my goal, and Wales didn\u2019t disappoint. It was a weekend of cycling in horizontal rain. The River Usk foamed the colour of chocolate at the bottom of the valley, as the mercifully flat towpath led into Brecon for shelter and warming soup.</p> <p>The Lake District could not have been more different \u2013 it was the August bank holiday weekend, when heat records were broken yet again. Accommodation was at the YHA: it was comfortable, a great budget option, and a lovely melting pot of people. From the hostel, the views across Windermere were spectacular, and the cycling was terrific \u2013 wild, windswept moorland and rich, luscious greenery. It was really hard, but I was fuelled by Kendal mint cake. The view changed with every turn, from a corrugated skyline of mountains to smaller hills marked with sheep and the scribbling of dry stone walls.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t flown for 10 years, and I\u2019m not about to start now. There is so much variety here in the UK that we\u2019re spoiled for choice with no-fly adventures.

There were 25 of us from the UK, and 446 in total, from 37 different countries. I took the train from Exeter to London, the Eurostar to Paris and then the TGV to Lausanne. It was the best train journey I\u2019ve ever done, watching the mountains pass as we travelled through the Alps. It was beautiful. We stayed in the Pontaise district and had meetings and workshops at the University of Lausanne. The food at the university was vegan, a lot of it from supermarkets who were about to throw it out \u2013 all fresh but going to waste because it had reached its sell by date.</p> <p>Lake Geneva is right beside the university. It has a beach where we went swimming and had seaweed fights. We also went into Lausanne town and bought Swiss chocolate. </p> <p>It was my first proper trip abroad without my family. They just went to Turkey without me, but I didn\u2019t want to fly, and don\u2019t enjoy the heat that much. We need to improve transport around the UK, and I think we should use a frequent flyer levy to invest in rail and bus travel, to make it easier to get around rural areas. </p> <h2>South of France on two wheels</h2> <p><strong>Ruth Hyde, director, <a href=\"https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Woodland Trust</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff926f7fe1585ab83132e63bdf19bc55bf02989e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff926f7fe1585ab83132e63bdf19bc55bf02989e/0_138_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val in Tarn-et-Garonne, which is 90km north of Toulouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val in Tarn-et-Garonne, which is 90km north of Toulouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Images Group/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This summer I went to Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val in Tarn-et-Garonne, in the south of France with a friend.

We saw a lot on the way down, and felt we\u2019d travelled properly; with air travel there\u2019s no real sense of journey.</p> <p>We stayed in a friend\u2019s townhouse a few minutes from the centre, called <a href=\"https://www.saintantoninnobleval.com/accommodation/cordeliers/\" title=\"\">Cordeliers</a>.

One ride took us to Saint Projet, where we joined a <em>march\u00e9 gourmand</em> community food event, with lots of food stalls and everyone eating at communal tables.

We caught the Snow Express coach from London Victoria to Tignes in the French Alps, which took around 20 hours with stops for coffee breaks. Part of the journey was on the Dover-Calais ferry, which gave us a chance to stretch our legs. .</p> <p>We booked into a <a href=\"https://www.ucpa.com/destination/village-sportif/tignes\" title=\"\">UCPA</a> (French non-profit) hostel that provides equipment, half-day lessons, lift passes and meals.

The Alps in winter aren\u2019t an obvious place to go birdwatching, but the snowy backdrop makes it easy to spot anything flying around.

It\u2019s increasingly difficult to justify the carbon emissions of flying. Next year, for any trips around the continent, the journey will be part of the holiday \u2013 watching the different landscapes pass by instead of hurrying around by plane.

      "bodyText": "A fisherman\u2019s hut in the Dordogne Kate Humble, TV presenter and author I\u2019d been having cabin fantasies \u2013 I wanted to go off-grid, swim in a river, eat tomatoes and read books. I wanted to be Huckleberry Finn. We booked a rural place in the north of the Dordogne, did lots of walking and as it was cep (porcini) season, the local market was full of delicious mushrooms. Most visitors to France buy wine and some cheese to take home, but by the end of the week we\u2019d found some land nearby for sale, with a little fisherman\u2019s hut by a lake, surrounded by trees. This was almost 10 years ago, and the two-room cabin is now our little piece of eco-heaven. We used clay and straw to plaster the inside, and the wood for the staircase and the handcut chestnut roof shingles came from our land or our neighbour\u2019s. It has a kitchen-living area, a bedroom under the eves, a terrace and a composting loo, but no telly or phone signal. There\u2019s a shower with a solar pump connected to the lake \u2013 but my favourite way of washing there is to heat a kettle on the woodburner and have a bucket shower. We go a couple of times a year, paddling on a raft and swimming, surrounded by kingfishers, swallows and dragonflies, with the sound of frogs in the evening. I once spent a month trying to spot a black woodpecker, which I saw fleetingly while running with my dog. You can feel like Henry David Thoreau on Walden Pond. For campervan drivers in France, there\u2019s a system called France Passion . Membership costs \u20ac28 and includes a directory of places where you can stay for free for 24 hours. Some have a farm shop, so you can buy, say, some cider in return. My favourite thing is the night walk (about \u20ac12) from Busserolles village, which usually happens in July. About 300 people of all ages meet at 7pm to take one of two routes (8km or 12km). After a few kilometres, you convene in a field where there are lots of bottles of wine and little amuse-bouches. Further on, another field has rows of trestle tables for the main course \u2013 perhaps a huge bowl of bean soup with bread and cheese \u2013 by which time it\u2019s dark and most people are a bit drunk. Back in the village there\u2019s coffee and eclairs or sticky buns and a disco in the square. It\u2019s a lovely community event that brings everyone together on the level that walking does. I\u2019m researching a book about living simply, so in November I\u2019m going to be an intern at the Earthship. It was started by architect Michael Reynolds, in Taos, New Mexico, who builds autonomous buildings made of 50% rubbish, designed to regulate temperature, recycle water, and have space to grow food. The book is about how to live happily with a lighter footprint on the planet. There\u2019s no blanket solution but it\u2019s about balance and consciousness, and as a global community, we\u2019re all culpable. \u2022 Poacher\u2019s Cabin sleeps two and is available to rent from Canopy &amp; Stars (\u00a390 a night) East of England boat and road trip Craig Bennett, CEO, Friends of the Earth One of the most important things to do on holiday is to disconnect from the outside world. No TV, no newspapers or looking at phones too much. When we visited the Norfolk Broads a few years ago, it was fantastic for going offline. Our children are 12 and 14, and it was the youngest who suggested it again for this year. Spending time as a family with the dogs on a boat with a top speed of about six miles an hour really makes you slow down. We picked up the boat in Stalham, cruised past Yarmouth to Beccles and Lowestoft then back up via Reedham. We did a few nights of wild moorings, under beautiful dark skies, and saw an otter or two, herons and lots of other wildlife. It\u2019s a different experience from other ways of travelling around the UK \u2013 arriving at little villages by water, taking a walk to seek out a teashop, or into a pub for dinner. We loved the Ferry Inn in Stokesby and the Rising Sun in Coltishall, both with overnight moorings. We then drove up the east coast to Northumberland and stayed in a cottage on a farm near Alnmouth. I had my first family holiday in the village when I was 13 and I\u2019d often pass it on the train to Edinburgh, and thought I\u2019d like to return. We spent half a day at Druridge Bay, just south of Amble. Friends of the Earth have been fighting against a proposal for a new opencast coal mine on this unspoiled coastal stretch. Tourism has brought in \u00a31bn for the region, but the proposal could end the very reason people visit these parts. The Northumberland coast is extraordinary, with beautiful sand dunes and hardly anyone there. We had a lot of long walks on dog-friendly beaches, made \u201cwater worlds\u201d in the sand, and caught a whiff of smoky kippers in Craster. People will often talk about holidays in the UK as a \u201cstaycation\u201d but I find that odd. When I was growing up, the normal thing was to holiday in the UK \u2013 it\u2019s how I got to know the country I live in, an experience I want my children to have too. Italy by train Emma Kemp, campaigner, 10:10 Climate Action, leader of its Climate Perks initiative Following a breakup, I decided to travel solo around Italy for two-and-a-half weeks in the hope of filling myself with Italian veggie food, sunny weather and Roman history. It was my first time travelling alone and the days before I left were speckled with excitement over my new-found independence, as well as nerves. I was stunned by the views from the train between Paris and Turin, through mountains and little villages. After a day spent cycling along the riverbank and eating amazing local raspberry and almond granita, it was on to the Cinque Terre, where fresh pesto in Vernazza was a highlight. Next, an overnight train took me to Puglia, the heel of Italy\u2019s boot. I adored the whole region: Lecce is all baroque architecture, and in Ostuni I feasted on regional beetroot and turnip-top soup and truffle pasta with wild mushrooms. A lot of the traditional food in this region is vegetarian, because meat was once unaffordable for most. Everyone told me the same thing about Naples: that you cry twice. Once when you arrive and again when you leave. I was surprised by how much this rang true. When I got off the coach it was a shock after clean, quaint Lecce, but I fell in love while wandering the city\u2019s streets and eating deep-fried pizza. After day trips to the Amalfi coast, Pompeii and Paestum \u2013 said to be the birthplace of mozzarella \u2013 I took a sleeper train to Sicily, which goes on the ferry to cross the Strait of Messina. Syracuse has an amazing archeological park, with both Greek and Roman ruins and, 15km south, a flawless beach called Fontane Bianche. Later in the trip I passed through Siena \u2013 stumbling on a vegan dessert shop during the busy horse race celebrations \u2013 and spent a rainy day in Venice. Going by train allowed me to rediscover the magic of travel, and although it was more expensive than flying, it didn\u2019t break the bank. New Forest wildlife walk Neil Ansell, author of The Last Wilderness: A Journey into Silence This year I made a conscious choice to stay close to home, using public transport to visit a place where I spent a lot of my childhood \u2013 the New Forest in Hampshire. The forest has some spectacular ancient woodland but also wide expanses of lowland heath which is great for wildlife but a globally threatened habitat. I took advantage of fine weather with an exposed heathland walk on Hampton Ridge in the north of the forest. From the bus stop in Fordingbridge, I walked two miles along country lanes to the hamlet of Frogham, where there is a pub, the Foresters Arms. Beside this is Harry\u2019s Field for camping, open only for summer weekends. The trail leads up onto a high gravel ridge with long views north and south over heathland flushed purple with heather. It looked just as I remembered it from my last visit, way back in the 1970s. The place is tranquil now, but it was not always so; in the 1940s it was part of a bombing range. There are still a few traces that remain, including a slightly alarming 30-metre concrete arrow, a directional marker for bombers. Beside the ever-present buzzards, there is a chance to see other birds of prey, including goshawks, hobbies and even honey buzzards; and in the gorse brakes along the ridge-line trail, there are stonechats and Dartford warblers, only found on lowland heath. At the end of the ridge, the trail leads left into the isolated Pitts Wood Inclosure, known for woodpeckers, crossbills, and hawfinches. I saw both roe and fallow deer too, fawns in tow, and by staying until dark, was able to watch the mysterious nightjar. From the wood, the path heads up Cockley Hill to the village of Godshill and the Fighting Cocks pub. I usually camp in the area; there are 40 campsites scattered around the forest, such as Longbeech close to this trail, where I\u2019ve stayed before. The walk, from roadhead to roadhead, could be managed in two or three hours, but it\u2019s better to make a day of it, or stay overnight, and just wander and soak up the atmosphere. Dartmoor eco-retreat Donnachadh McCarthy, co-founder of Stop Killing Cyclists and author of The Prostitute State \u2013 How Our Democracy Has Been Bought I usually seek out a rural UK eco-retreat for a holiday, and this year headed to the Rewilding Consciousness retreat at the Embercombe Centre near Dartmoor. I travelled by fold-up bike to the station, took a train to Exeter, then cycled to Embercombe \u2013 a hilly but pleasingly low-traffic ride. The great thing about a bike is that if you have to push it uphill, you have fun free-wheeling down the other side. Halfway there, the heavens opened, turning the roads into raging muddy torrents. I got soaked, but this was warm summer rain so felt like a hilarious adventure. Rolling up to reception, I stood in silence looking at the valley below and felt a sense of achievement in getting there without motor transport. Accommodation was in little yurt villages, with woodburners and composting loos among trees laden with ripe fruit. The wind in the woodland whispered gently, and roared in a glorious storm one evening. Embercombe also has a lake called Tree Mirror, which is great for swimming. The course taught us to open our ears and eyes to nature and reconnect to it in a way that we have lost in our busy tech-based lives. On the final evening, I slipped out to the stone circle to spend the night in my sleeping bag under the full moon. By the end of a week without my phone, my soul felt recharged. Investing in such \u201choly-days\u201d heals our hearts and minds. Sussex countryside Roger Hallam, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion One of the under-reported things about Extinction Rebellion (XR) is that it\u2019s developing into a really close community. A lot of people who felt isolated in their horror at the climate emergency suddenly find all these other compassionate, dedicated people who feel the same, so there\u2019s an immediate connection. Naturally, people get to know each other and travel to see one another for talks and events. More than once I\u2019ve rung someone in the organisation and they\u2019ve helped me find somewhere to stay. I\u2019ve been very busy this year, and didn\u2019t have much planned for the summer. I was asked to talk at Byline Festival in East Sussex [which helps promote independent journalism], so decided to have a holiday in the area too. I phoned an XR friend in Brighton and asked if she knew of anyone with a bit of land to camp on but it turned out her family home was in the countryside near Pulborough, and she let us borrow it. We mostly relaxed at the house but did go to the local village fete in Rackham one day. But my thing is cooking. I\u2019m an organic farmer (although I\u2019m now mainly based in the XR London office), so I brought enough veg from the farm in Wales to last us the week. We had a vegan sausage barbecue, and there were apples, plums and blackberries growing onsite to make a pie from. The South Downs was great for long walks \u2013 it\u2019s about as wild as southern England gets. I often travel around the UK, but I don\u2019t take many holidays. There\u2019s definitely a balance that we\u2019re all trying to negotiate, and the two big lifestyle issues are flying and meat. My feeling is that we are on the verge of a major change in social attitudes. Transylvania\u2019s \u2018hidden village\u2019 Nicoleta Carpineanu, founder of Forests Without Frontiers I live in Brighton but one of my favourite places to go on holiday is Transylvania, where I\u2019m from. It\u2019s a place of wild, untouched beauty and I go back whenever I can. Cluj is the second-largest city in Romania and is very multicultural, home to lots of artists and festivals, such as the Transylvanian film festival in May, and Untold dance music festival in August. Cluj is very close to the Apuseni mountains, where I stay in a restored village called Raven\u2019s Nest. They\u2019ve converted beautiful old houses into guest accommodation and source local products for everything, from soaps to throws. The views are stunning and there\u2019s an outdoor hot tub for soaking under the stars. The restaurant uses regional, organic ingredients and has a good selection of Romanian wines. I love walking to waterfalls and caves in the surrounding wilderness. There are bears here and other amazing wildlife, too. I\u2019m going back to Romania at the end of September and plan to take the train there via Vienna, where I\u2019ll spend the night. It\u2019s one of my favourite capitals, the meeting place of east and west Europe. I love the museums. I\u2019ll continue to Romania by rail, and visit the area in the Carpathian mountains where I\u2019m planting trees with my new reforestation charity, Forests Without Frontiers. I want to visit Amfiteatrul, an eco-lodge in the mountains that I\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about. This is my favourite kind of trip \u2013 slow travel, really connecting with nature and with local people. Cycling in Wales and the Lake District Anna Hughes, author and founder of Flight Free UK I\u2019m training for a big cycle ride this month, from Dieppe to Nice. I\u2019ll take the ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe, stopping off at Mont Ventoux in Provence for the not-insignificant challenge of cycling up the mountain from three different approaches in one day. So my summer has been a series of weekend training trips in the UK, visiting places I love or have never been to. Abergavenny falls into the latter group. The Tumble, a famous climb at the edge of the Brecon Beacons, was my goal, and Wales didn\u2019t disappoint. It was a weekend of cycling in horizontal rain. The River Usk foamed the colour of chocolate at the bottom of the valley, as the mercifully flat towpath led into Brecon for shelter and warming soup. The Lake District could not have been more different \u2013 it was the August bank holiday weekend, when heat records were broken yet again. Accommodation was at the YHA: it was comfortable, a great budget option, and a lovely melting pot of people. From the hostel, the views across Windermere were spectacular, and the cycling was terrific \u2013 wild, windswept moorland and rich, luscious greenery. It was really hard, but I was fuelled by Kendal mint cake. The view changed with every turn, from a corrugated skyline of mountains to smaller hills marked with sheep and the scribbling of dry stone walls. I haven\u2019t flown for 10 years, and I\u2019m not about to start now. There is so much variety here in the UK that we\u2019re spoiled for choice with no-fly adventures. And my return from Nice next month will be by train. Train to Switzerland Sophie Sleeman, UK Student Climate Network After turning down a trip to New York in May because I didn\u2019t want to fly, I had the chance to go to Lausanne in Switzerland for a week in August, for an international conference with other young climate activists. There were 25 of us from the UK, and 446 in total, from 37 different countries. I took the train from Exeter to London, the Eurostar to Paris and then the TGV to Lausanne. It was the best train journey I\u2019ve ever done, watching the mountains pass as we travelled through the Alps. It was beautiful. We stayed in the Pontaise district and had meetings and workshops at the University of Lausanne. The food at the university was vegan, a lot of it from supermarkets who were about to throw it out \u2013 all fresh but going to waste because it had reached its sell by date. Lake Geneva is right beside the university. It has a beach where we went swimming and had seaweed fights. We also went into Lausanne town and bought Swiss chocolate. It was my first proper trip abroad without my family. They just went to Turkey without me, but I didn\u2019t want to fly, and don\u2019t enjoy the heat that much. We need to improve transport around the UK, and I think we should use a frequent flyer levy to invest in rail and bus travel, to make it easier to get around rural areas. South of France on two wheels Ruth Hyde, director, Woodland Trust This summer I went to Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val in Tarn-et-Garonne, in the south of France with a friend. I wanted somewhere I could drive to with my road bike, so we took the Eurotunnel, but abandoned the car for the week to cycle and walk around. We saw a lot on the way down, and felt we\u2019d travelled properly; with air travel there\u2019s no real sense of journey. We stayed in a friend\u2019s townhouse a few minutes from the centre, called Cordeliers. There\u2019s a great Sunday market on the town square selling local produce \u2013 cheese, bread, wine and wobbly fruit and vegetables that taste amazing. As the town is in a gorge, whichever way you cycle, it seems to be up. But there are plenty of medieval towns with old churches and ruins to explore, with masses of countryside and smooth riding on often empty roads in between. We\u2019d go out in the mornings before it got too hot, then sometimes spend the afternoon relaxing by the River Aveyron, swimming or exploring by kayak. One ride took us to Saint Projet, where we joined a march\u00e9 gourmand community food event, with lots of food stalls and everyone eating at communal tables. This one was big on goat\u2019s cheeses and aligot \u2013 the smoothest mashed potato ever with cheese and garlic. Next year I\u2019m planning to cycle coast to coast in France, probably from Caen to Nice, which is around 900 miles and will be a real adventure. Skiing in the French Alps Tiffany Francis, nature writer and author of Dark Skies: A journey into the Wild Night Last January, my husband and I went for a week of snowboarding and skiing for my birthday. We caught the Snow Express coach from London Victoria to Tignes in the French Alps, which took around 20 hours with stops for coffee breaks. Part of the journey was on the Dover-Calais ferry, which gave us a chance to stretch our legs. . We booked into a UCPA (French non-profit) hostel that provides equipment, half-day lessons, lift passes and meals. It was beautiful weather all week, with good snowfalls overnight. One morning I explored the area on foot, and loved watching a flock of Alpine choughs \u2013 a yellow-beaked member of the crow family \u2013 hopping over chalet roofs in the warm sun. The Alps in winter aren\u2019t an obvious place to go birdwatching, but the snowy backdrop makes it easy to spot anything flying around. There\u2019s also the chance to see bearded vultures, one instructor told us, which are on the rise in the area after a successful breeding programme. Being out on the slopes all day meant most evenings were spent eating and relaxing, but on my birthday we went to Cocorico apr\u00e8s ski bar. The music was cheesy 1990s and noughties, which was perfect for singing along to, no matter what languages everyone spoke. We had a great night drinking beers and vodka shots and dancing under the stars. We both love travelling by train, and have decided to avoid taking flights in Europe for the foreseeable future. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to justify the carbon emissions of flying. Next year, for any trips around the continent, the journey will be part of the holiday \u2013 watching the different landscapes pass by instead of hurrying around by plane. We love the idea so much we\u2019re now thinking of saving up to take the Trans-Siberian Express to Mongolia. Looking for a holiday with a difference?

My nine-year-old son is severely autistic and attends a specialist school and, because I don\u2019t have any childcare available as my family work full time, I had to quit my job to become a carer for my son. He has several health-related appointments a week, and with me on my own now, it would have been difficult to find a job, as employers don\u2019t tend to be flexible. My daughter attends a different school and the school run takes me one-and-a-half hours.

Even though I was earning a lot, I felt that putting it on the credit card was a better option than buying things with cash.</p> <p>I ignored the letters for a while and hoped the situation would go away. I was petrified to answer my door in case bailiffs were standing there. But in March last year I contacted National Debtline for advice, and explained my circumstances, and they gave me some options. As I didn\u2019t own any assets, I felt the best decision was to declare myself bankrupt, which I did in April 2018. I was discharged from bankruptcy in April this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a654545ec1352be0380d045f6de57b93fce228f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a654545ec1352be0380d045f6de57b93fce228f1/0_121_4242_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The diary in which Amy notes down her spending\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The diary in which Amy notes down her spending.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pinder/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being debt-free has felt like a new start.

Out of that, I pay \u00a3550 a month for my rent. My daughter goes to stage school, which is \u00a390 a month, which I pay if I can, or my mum helps us out.</p> <p>I\u2019ve finally learned how to manage money. Rather than set up direct debits, I physically pay or transfer the money, as paying it makes me aware of how much is in my account. I have a diary in the kitchen where I write down what needs to be paid and what date. For example, on a Friday I top up \u00a320 on the gas and electricity. I\u2019m quite strict with my budget now. I give myself a food shopping budget of \u00a350 a week, and only carry that amount with me.

For example, it looks at your income and outgoings and, based on what you spend, it might take a certain amount out and put it into a separate savings pot. I started it in March this year and I\u2019ve already saved \u00a3800. With Christmas coming up, it\u2019s nice to know that in December I don\u2019t have to panic and will have that money to one side.</p> <p>We don\u2019t have any holidays planned, but earlier this year we enjoyed a break to Haven in Primrose Valley [in North Yorkshire] on behalf of Family Fund, which provides grants to families with disabled children.</p> <p>Do I spend any money on me? No, not really \u2013 all the money is spent on the kids. I don\u2019t go out or drink or smoke. I don\u2019t ever buy myself clothes \u2013 the only new clothes are if my mum buys them for us.

      "bodyText": "Name: Amy McDermott Age: 32 Income: \u00a31,374 per month in benefits Occupation: full-time mother Life has changed dramatically for me over the past two years \u2013 I\u2019ve gone from being married and having a successful career in marketing with a healthy income of \u00a33,500 a month to becoming a single parent and declaring myself bankrupt. On top of dealing with the breakup of my marriage, I had to move house, start again in a new place and really explore my options. My nine-year-old son is severely autistic and attends a specialist school and, because I don\u2019t have any childcare available as my family work full time, I had to quit my job to become a carer for my son. He has several health-related appointments a week, and with me on my own now, it would have been difficult to find a job, as employers don\u2019t tend to be flexible. My daughter attends a different school and the school run takes me one-and-a-half hours. When my mum retires I\u2019ll look to go back to work, as she\u2019ll be able to take over the appointments. By the time my ex and I split up, I\u2019d accumulated quite a lot of debt: in total it was \u00a330,000. Even though I was earning a lot, I felt that putting it on the credit card was a better option than buying things with cash. I ignored the letters for a while and hoped the situation would go away. I was petrified to answer my door in case bailiffs were standing there. But in March last year I contacted National Debtline for advice, and explained my circumstances, and they gave me some options. As I didn\u2019t own any assets, I felt the best decision was to declare myself bankrupt, which I did in April 2018. I was discharged from bankruptcy in April this year. Being debt-free has felt like a new start. I never slept when I was in debt \u2013 I felt worried all the time. I currently receive a carer\u2019s allowance of \u00a3264 a month, \u00a3720 in tax credits and \u00a3390 for housing benefit, all of which comes to a total of \u00a31,374 for the month. Out of that, I pay \u00a3550 a month for my rent. My daughter goes to stage school, which is \u00a390 a month, which I pay if I can, or my mum helps us out. I\u2019ve finally learned how to manage money. Rather than set up direct debits, I physically pay or transfer the money, as paying it makes me aware of how much is in my account. I have a diary in the kitchen where I write down what needs to be paid and what date. For example, on a Friday I top up \u00a320 on the gas and electricity. I\u2019m quite strict with my budget now. I give myself a food shopping budget of \u00a350 a week, and only carry that amount with me. Every day I write down how much I\u2019ve spent and then, at the end of the week, I go through it, highlighting what could have been avoided. My friend introduced me to a financial app, Plum, which matches up to your bank account and creates your own savings pot. For example, it looks at your income and outgoings and, based on what you spend, it might take a certain amount out and put it into a separate savings pot. I started it in March this year and I\u2019ve already saved \u00a3800. With Christmas coming up, it\u2019s nice to know that in December I don\u2019t have to panic and will have that money to one side. We don\u2019t have any holidays planned, but earlier this year we enjoyed a break to Haven in Primrose Valley [in North Yorkshire] on behalf of Family Fund, which provides grants to families with disabled children. Do I spend any money on me? No, not really \u2013 all the money is spent on the kids. I don\u2019t go out or drink or smoke. I don\u2019t ever buy myself clothes \u2013 the only new clothes are if my mum buys them for us. As long as the kids are happy and they\u2019ve got plenty to do and keep occupied with, then I\u2019m happy. As told to Suzanne Bearne",

Other motions going into the same composite include ending airport expansion and re-wilding 25% of Britain\u2019s land.</p> <h2>Abolish private schools</h2> <p>This proposal \u2013 brought forward by the <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/a7aa2d643ebe/abolisheton\">Abolish Eton</a> campaign and now backed by Momentum \u2013 would see Labour commit to integrating private schools into the state sector. It has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/18/john-mcdonnell-backs-abolish-eton-debate-labour-conference\">endorsed by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell</a>. More recently Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said she would make no attempt to water it down. It would include a redistribution of the endowments, investment and properties held by private schools across the country\u2019s educational institutions.</p> <h2>A four-day week</h2> <p>Backed by the campaign group <a href=\"https://gmail.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4c80d58ed52811b3975a3d098&amp;id=0fc989ce16\">Labour </a><a href=\"https://gmail.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4c80d58ed52811b3975a3d098&amp;id=0fc989ce16\">For a Four Day Week</a>, Momentum and the CWU, this policy would see a transition to a 32-hour week with no loss in pay. Before the conference, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/12/four-day-working-week-report\">Labour-commissioned report by the crossbench peer Robert Skidelsky</a> said working fewer hours would be good for people\u2019s wellbeing but a rigid four-day week was not realistic or desirable.</p> <h2>Abolish detention centres</h2> <p>Backed by Momentum and Labour against Racism and Fascism, this proposal would see the closure of all detention centres, replacing them with a community-based alternative. Labour has already committed to closing two of the most notorious detention centres \u2013 Yarl\u2019s Wood and Brook House \u2013 but not all of them.

      "bodyText": "With a general election likely to come within months, or perhaps even weeks, Labour activists are pushing for a series of transformative policies to be included in the party\u2019s manifesto, to make it the party\u2019s most radical ever. Green New Deal Momentum is backing the biggest policy push at conference towards a radical Green New Deal, including a target of zero carbon by 2030. With more than 120 motions from local parties, this is the most popular policy submitted for consideration, and if adopted will result in Labour having one of the most radical climate change policies in the world. Other motions going into the same composite include ending airport expansion and re-wilding 25% of Britain\u2019s land. Abolish private schools This proposal \u2013 brought forward by the Abolish Eton campaign and now backed by Momentum \u2013 would see Labour commit to integrating private schools into the state sector. It has been endorsed by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. More recently Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said she would make no attempt to water it down. It would include a redistribution of the endowments, investment and properties held by private schools across the country\u2019s educational institutions. A four-day week Backed by the campaign group Labour For a Four Day Week, Momentum and the CWU, this policy would see a transition to a 32-hour week with no loss in pay. Before the conference, a Labour-commissioned report by the crossbench peer Robert Skidelsky said working fewer hours would be good for people\u2019s wellbeing but a rigid four-day week was not realistic or desirable. Abolish detention centres Backed by Momentum and Labour against Racism and Fascism, this proposal would see the closure of all detention centres, replacing them with a community-based alternative. Labour has already committed to closing two of the most notorious detention centres \u2013 Yarl\u2019s Wood and Brook House \u2013 but not all of them. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, is expected to give more details of how the party would liberalise the immigration system in her speech on Sunday. Compulsory purchase of empty houses and link rents to local incomes Submitted by local parties, these proposals will give councils increased power to purchase empty homes and cap rents at a third of local incomes. Other policies in the same area would also affirm a community right to buy and bring into local public ownership privately rented homes owned by big landlords, management companies and housing associations. Inclusive ownership funds This policy, announced by McDonnell at last year\u2019s Labour conference, would transfer 1% of the ownership of a company to its workers every year up to a certain percentage. Workers would be paid a dividend up to \u00a3500, with the remaining dividends going to a national wealth fund that benefits all citizens.",

      "body": "<p>Just before we moved into our house, I was given a quick demonstration of the existing alarm system. I paid almost no attention. I will leave it alone, I thought, and it will leave me alone.</p> <p>Two years later, the alarm remains off, or mostly off; the panel in the hall has a yellow light that blinks 24 hours a day. Sometimes when it\u2019s very dark its pulse can be felt through the whole house \u2013 a faint reflection glancing off walls, reaching up the stairs. I hardly notice it any more.</p> <p>It is late morning. I am sitting in my office shed when my wife comes to the door.</p> <p>\u201cThe alarm is doing something weird,\u201d she says. I am momentarily bewildered.</p> <p>\u201cThe alarm?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cYou mean the car?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cNo, the house,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cOur house?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cAre you doing this on purpose?\u201d she says.</p> <p>I follow her through the kitchen and into the hall. The alarm isn\u2019t going off, but issuing some kind of warning: a loud, two-note chirp that sounds inside the house, not outside. It\u2019s more than annoying; there is something accusatory in it.</p> <p>The panel is lit up, with a notification scrolling by \u2013 something to do with a numbered error message.</p> <p>\u201cIt wants the security code,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat is the security code?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d my wife says. \u201cI\u2019ve never known.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d I say. \u201cWait.\u201d I take out my keyring, on which hangs a little plastic fob I was given two years ago, bearing the logo of the alarm company. I touch it to the panel and the noise stops.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll invoice you,\u201d I say.</p> <p>This is not the end of the story, but the beginning. The alarm sounds the same warning a week later, and again I silence it with the fob. After that it begins a new cycle, going off every few nights at precisely 4.50am. I trudge down the stairs with my keys and trudge back up again, but I can\u2019t go back to sleep.</p> <p>It takes no more than a week for the alarm to break me. I have trouble getting to sleep in the first place, not knowing if tonight is one of the nights I will be woken at 4.50am. Sometimes the youngest one beats me downstairs, armed with a spare fob he found in a drawer. The first time it happened, I thought he was a burglar. My heart continued to thud for a further hour.</p> <p>\u201cI called the alarm people,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThey wanted to charge me \u00a3260 just to look at it, so I told them to fuck off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I was actually very polite,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say, \u201cbecause I think they might have us over a barrel.\u201d I can find no manual or online remedies, other than the suggestion that I purchase an annual maintenance contract. I begin to suspect the alarm has been remotely programmed to torture me until I give in.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive,\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cI think the alarm might be the most expensive thing we own,\u201d I say. \u201cOur best hope is that someone breaks in and steals it.\u201d</p> <p>The next day I am in a recording studio, eyes itching, when my wife rings.</p> <p>\u201cSo I was coming back from the shops and I saw one of their vans parked in the road,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cThe alarm company,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cYou mean they\u2019re spying on us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI knocked on the guy\u2019s window and gave him 20 quid to come in and look at the box.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe just happened to be there?\u201d I say. \u201cBy coincidence?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/24/tim-dowling-when-you-die-want-that-picture\">Tim Dowling: 'When you die, I want that picture,' the oldest says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d she says. \u201cAnyway, he said there was a fault with one of the sensors, back door or something, and he just turned that bit off.

      "bodyText": "Just before we moved into our house, I was given a quick demonstration of the existing alarm system. I paid almost no attention. I will leave it alone, I thought, and it will leave me alone. Two years later, the alarm remains off, or mostly off; the panel in the hall has a yellow light that blinks 24 hours a day. Sometimes when it\u2019s very dark its pulse can be felt through the whole house \u2013 a faint reflection glancing off walls, reaching up the stairs. I hardly notice it any more. It is late morning. I am sitting in my office shed when my wife comes to the door. \u201cThe alarm is doing something weird,\u201d she says. I am momentarily bewildered. \u201cThe alarm?\u201d I say. \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cYou mean the car?\u201d I say. \u201cNo, the house,\u201d she says. \u201cOur house?\u201d I say. \u201cAre you doing this on purpose?\u201d she says. I follow her through the kitchen and into the hall. The alarm isn\u2019t going off, but issuing some kind of warning: a loud, two-note chirp that sounds inside the house, not outside. It\u2019s more than annoying; there is something accusatory in it. The panel is lit up, with a notification scrolling by \u2013 something to do with a numbered error message. \u201cIt wants the security code,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat is the security code?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d my wife says. \u201cI\u2019ve never known.\u201d \u201cMe, neither,\u201d I say. \u201cWait.\u201d I take out my keyring, on which hangs a little plastic fob I was given two years ago, bearing the logo of the alarm company. I touch it to the panel and the noise stops. \u201cI\u2019ll invoice you,\u201d I say. This is not the end of the story, but the beginning. The alarm sounds the same warning a week later, and again I silence it with the fob. After that it begins a new cycle, going off every few nights at precisely 4.50am. I trudge down the stairs with my keys and trudge back up again, but I can\u2019t go back to sleep. It takes no more than a week for the alarm to break me. I have trouble getting to sleep in the first place, not knowing if tonight is one of the nights I will be woken at 4.50am. Sometimes the youngest one beats me downstairs, armed with a spare fob he found in a drawer. The first time it happened, I thought he was a burglar. My heart continued to thud for a further hour. \u201cI called the alarm people,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThey wanted to charge me \u00a3260 just to look at it, so I told them to fuck off.\u201d \u201cDid you?\u201d I say. \u201cNo, I was actually very polite,\u201d she says. \u201cGood,\u201d I say, \u201cbecause I think they might have us over a barrel.\u201d I can find no manual or online remedies, other than the suggestion that I purchase an annual maintenance contract. I begin to suspect the alarm has been remotely programmed to torture me until I give in. \u201cIt\u2019s too expensive,\u201d my wife says. \u201cI think the alarm might be the most expensive thing we own,\u201d I say. \u201cOur best hope is that someone breaks in and steals it.\u201d The next day I am in a recording studio, eyes itching, when my wife rings. \u201cSo I was coming back from the shops and I saw one of their vans parked in the road,\u201d she says. \u201cWho?\u201d I say. \u201cThe alarm company,\u201d she says. \u201cYou mean they\u2019re spying on us?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI knocked on the guy\u2019s window and gave him 20 quid to come in and look at the box.\u201d \u201cHe just happened to be there?\u201d I say. \u201cBy coincidence?\u201d \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d she says. \u201cAnyway, he said there was a fault with one of the sensors, back door or something, and he just turned that bit off. It took five minutes.\u201d \u201cWow,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat you mean is\u2026\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I mean is, well done.\u201d \u201cCorrect,\u201d she says. I am reminded, not for the first time, of the extent to which my life is made secure by the vigilance of an actual capable person. That night I sleep soundly and gratefully, until 4.50am, when I am woken by the alarm.",

If you\u2019re still a Corbynista, then the notion of him as a stabilising premier for today\u2019s turbulent Britain may be equally absurd.

With western capitalism having a crisis of confidence, at the very least \u2013 this week the Financial Times announced <a href=\"https://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/09/18/ft-calls-reset-capitalism-biggest-brand-push-2008-financial-crash\" title=\"\">\u201cCapitalism: time for a reset\u201d</a> \u2013 Labour\u2019s radical economic alternatives have begun to look more reasonable to some business journalists. The Economist, despite its longstanding support for the Thatcherite free-market reforms that McDonnell would like to reverse, has been covering the development of Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/05/17/corbynomics-would-change-britain-but-not-in-the-way-most-people-think\" title=\"\">new economic thinking</a> with intense curiosity since 2017. This month, the more cautious, centrist FT has published a succession of long articles about \u201cLabour\u2019s new establishment\u201d and its ambitions for Britain. While the pieces were still spiked with criticisms, the scale of the coverage has suggested a degree of respect \u2013 and that corporate Britain needs to understand Corbynism, and be prepared to make some accommodations with it. </p> <p>Meanwhile, even some Conservatives have been daring to say the unsayable. In August, the Welsh MP Guto Bebb, a defence minister until last year, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-49355867\" title=\"\">declared that</a> \u201ca short-term [caretaker] Jeremy Corbyn government\u201d would be \u201cless damaging\u201d than a no-deal Brexit.

On the face of it, the shift is all about stopping or moderating Brexit, at any cost. A little less obviously, it\u2019s about the condition of the Conservative government: its snowballing incompetence, its increasingly manic and fantastical policies, its disregard for democracy and the law, its readiness to break up the UK, and its shallow pool of talent after almost a decade in power.

First, do British voters actually want a sober, reforming government? The polls currently suggest not: since Johnson began his cartoonish premiership, Labour has been consistently behind (though the margins have varied from substantial to tiny, usually according to the pollsters\u2019 different methods).</p> <p>Britain has arguably not had a Labour government with ambitions to profoundly alter the country since Harold Wilson\u2019s first in the 1960s (and his reforming zeal didn\u2019t last long). With Labour so often cautious since, many voters \u2013 and political journalists \u2013 have become unused to making the effort needed to consider novel and ambitious leftwing policies, such as McDonnell\u2019s plan to change the balance of power in companies permanently by making their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/23/labour-private-sector-employee-ownership-plan-john-mcdonnell\" title=\"\">workforces into major shareholders</a>. It\u2019s easier just to dismiss such proposals as anti-business, and then get back to gossiping about the latest Tory leadership shambles.</p> <p>Another problem for Labour with trying to play the grownups is that clearing up messes left by Conservative governments can be a thankless task. In 1974, Wilson\u2019s second administration inherited an economic and industrial relations crisis from the disastrous 1970-74 premiership of Edward Heath. Wilson never quite managed to resolve the crisis, and soon his party was blamed for it \u2013 so much so that Britain\u2019s struggles during the 1970s have been synonymous with Labour ever since.</p> <p>Corbyn and McDonnell\u2019s smart suits and new ideas will only get them a fair hearing from the establishment for so long. A Corbyn government, if it ever comes, will disrupt the status quo: \u201cChange is coming,\u201d McDonnell warned the FT this month. For the moment, some business figures may prefer a Corbyn government to a Tory one that can\u2019t guarantee the food supply; but they may soon decide that an actual reforming Labour government is not such a good idea after all. As Oliver Harvey of Deutsche Bank reassured the Telegraph, \u201cany market-unfriendly policies instigated during a Labour government\u201d need only be \u201ctemporary\u201d. They would apply only \u201cuntil the government is voted out of office\u201d. And just in case that doesn\u2019t happen quickly enough, the papers read by Britain\u2019s rich are full of articles about how to get your money out of the country. </p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the Guardian</p>",

He was there in Los Angeles when his boss was sacked on national TV, by the president, at the advice of Jared Kushner.</p> <p>Less than a year later, Campbell wrote <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/opinion/leaving-the-fbi.html\">a column for the New York Times</a>, titled \u201cWhy I Am Leaving the FBI\u201d. He has now authored a must-read on what went down in the first 18 months of the Trump presidency. Filled with color and quotes, it is highly digestible.</p> <p>Campbell remains disgusted by the debasement of law enforcement institutions by the president and his allies. Just as Comey did, he sees Trump acting as a \u201cmob boss\u201d.</p> <p>After watching Trump suck up to Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in July 2018, Campbell concludes that Trump acted as if he were somehow compromised by the Russian strongman and \u201cafraid of what Mueller might find\u201d.

In rebuttal, he painstakingly lays out a tick-tock of the Russia investigation, codenamed \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d.</p> <p>The popularization on the right of the idea that the deep state is a source of Trump\u2019s woes lies with Breitbart, which began flogging the concept in <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/12/12/virgil-the-deep-state-vs-donald-trump/\">December 2016</a>. Yet as a Steve Bannon, the brains behind Trump\u2019s victory and a former head of Breitbart, told the author Michael Wolff: \u201cYou do realize \u2026 none of this is true.\u201d Let that sink in.</p> <p>Crossfire Hurricane also turns it guns on Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general; Rod Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general; William Barr, the current attorney general; and Sarah Sanders, Trump\u2019s former spokeswoman. It is a target-rich environment.</p> <p>Campbell accuses Rosenstein of Janus-faced duplicity. In his telling, Rosenstein invited Comey to speak to a group of lawyers on \u201ceffective leadership\u201d, then in a matter of weeks branded Comey a \u201cterrible leader who was no longer effective\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Campbell describes Rosenstein\u2019s oleaginous efforts to get hold of him after learning the author had a gig on CNN. Suffice to say, Campbell is neither flattered nor amused.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Not surprisingly, Campbell rejects the notion of a 'deep state' in opposition to the 'will of the people'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Barr comes in for his share of criticism. Campbell tags him for his letter that characterized the Mueller report as giving Trump a clean bill of legal health, when it did no such thing.

      "bodyText": "Few people had better seats than Josh Campbell for the drama that has shaped the Trump presidency. A supervisory special agent at the FBI, he was special assistant to James Comey and stayed on into Robert Mueller\u2019s first year as special counsel. In real time, he witnessed the investigations into both Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. He was there in Los Angeles when his boss was sacked on national TV, by the president, at the advice of Jared Kushner. Less than a year later, Campbell wrote a column for the New York Times, titled \u201cWhy I Am Leaving the FBI\u201d. He has now authored a must-read on what went down in the first 18 months of the Trump presidency. Filled with color and quotes, it is highly digestible. Campbell remains disgusted by the debasement of law enforcement institutions by the president and his allies. Just as Comey did, he sees Trump acting as a \u201cmob boss\u201d. After watching Trump suck up to Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in July 2018, Campbell concludes that Trump acted as if he were somehow compromised by the Russian strongman and \u201cafraid of what Mueller might find\u201d. In light of recent reports that Trump\u2019s communications with an unidentified foreign leader may have injured US security and triggered a standoff between the administration and Congress, Campbell\u2019s take cannot be readily dismissed. Not surprisingly, Campbell rejects the notion of a \u201cdeep state\u201d in opposition to the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. In rebuttal, he painstakingly lays out a tick-tock of the Russia investigation, codenamed \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d. The popularization on the right of the idea that the deep state is a source of Trump\u2019s woes lies with Breitbart, which began flogging the concept in December 2016. Yet as a Steve Bannon, the brains behind Trump\u2019s victory and a former head of Breitbart, told the author Michael Wolff: \u201cYou do realize \u2026 none of this is true.\u201d Let that sink in. Crossfire Hurricane also turns it guns on Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general; Rod Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general; William Barr, the current attorney general; and Sarah Sanders, Trump\u2019s former spokeswoman. It is a target-rich environment. Campbell accuses Rosenstein of Janus-faced duplicity. In his telling, Rosenstein invited Comey to speak to a group of lawyers on \u201ceffective leadership\u201d, then in a matter of weeks branded Comey a \u201cterrible leader who was no longer effective\u201d. Elsewhere, Campbell describes Rosenstein\u2019s oleaginous efforts to get hold of him after learning the author had a gig on CNN. Suffice to say, Campbell is neither flattered nor amused. Barr comes in for his share of criticism. Campbell tags him for his letter that characterized the Mueller report as giving Trump a clean bill of legal health, when it did no such thing. As the special counsel said, Barr\u2019s account \u201cdid not fully capture the context, nature and substance\u201d of the actual report. Campbell also takes issue with Barr\u2019s public contention that the Trump campaign was the target of \u201cspying\u201d. In Campbell\u2019s view, the accusation was baseless political \u201cred meat\u201d, another indication that \u201cTrump\u2019s war on the FBI is far from over\u201d. As for Sanders, Campbell is filled with unbridled \u2013 and deserved \u2013 contempt. After Comey was fired, the White House press secretary went on national TV and lied \u201cabout countless members of the FBI\u201d who were supposedly grateful. On that score, Campbell quotes an FBI agent who bluntly bellowed \u201cWhat a load of bullshit\u201d and labeled Huckabee\u2019s story \u201ccomplete garbage\u201d. Sanders confessed to the special counsel that her comment was Trump fan fiction, \u201cmade \u2018in the heat of the moment\u2019 that was not founded on anything\u201d. Sanders is now a member of the Fox commentariat and complains that \u201c99%\u201d of the people who attack her are women. In case she missed it, women went for Clinton by 14 points in 2016 and voted Democratic almost three to two in last year\u2019s midterms. Sanders appears to be angling to run for Arkansas governor, a job once held by her father. Crossfire Hurricane also shines a light on Devin Nunes and the battle over Trump within the House intelligence committee, which can be described as both discouraging and illuminating. Campbell interviews Eric Swalwell, a committee member and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. From Swalwell\u2019s perspective, life within the intelligence committee was icy, not heated: an undesirable outcome. As Swalwell frames it, he actually wishes things had become \u201ccontentious\u201d because \u201cthat would have meant that Nunes and the Republicans were engaging us. But they never engaged.\u201d Committee Democrats met with \u201cblank stares\u201d, he says. What this episode holds for a post-Trump world should leave Americans worried. The book also grapples with Comey\u2019s conduct of the Clinton investigation, recording voices critical of the press conference in which he announced that Clinton would not be prosecuted, but said her conduct was less than desirable. Among those interviewed is Robby Mook, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. Campbell also suggests the debacle arose because Loretta Lynch, then attorney general, declined to recuse herself after meeting Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac, and Comey felt it necessary to throw himself into the breach. As Campbell puts it: \u201cTwo things I know for certain. The first is that James Comey is an honorable man.\u201d Second, \u201cComey was dealt an impossible hand.\u201d In late August, the justice department inspector general issued his report on Comey memorializing his meetings with the president then leaking them to the press.

More important, \u201cDoJ declined prosecution\u201d and national security was not compromised. Even by Trump\u2019s own twisted standards, Comey and Campbell have some reason to smile.",

America\u2019s Mayor has tied himself in ever-tighter knots over claims that at Trump\u2019s behest he improperly sought to coerce Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden in the hope of dredging up damaging information.</p> <p>No fewer than <a href=\"https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=685\">three House committees</a> this week launched investigations into the Trump-Giuliani efforts in Ukraine. Though not yet on the scale of Mueller\u2019s inquiry into whether Trump colluded with Russia, the new uproar bears chilling echoes of it.</p> <p>At the heart of the row is the whistleblower complaint that was raised by an intelligence official on 12 August. Exactly what that complaint says is not yet known, but details have emerged that point the spotlight squarely at Ukraine.</p> <p>Reporting led by the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trumps-communications-with-foreign-leader-are-part-of-whistleblower-complaint-that-spurred-standoff-between-spy-chief-and-congress-former-officials-say/2019/09/18/df651aa2-da60-11e9-bfb1-849887369476_story.html\">Washington Post</a> suggests the unnamed official was so alarmed by Trump\u2019s \u201ccommunications with a foreign leader\u201d \u2013 now thought to be Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2013 that he or she considered it a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d.</p> <p>On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-defends-conversation-with-ukraine-leader-11568993176?mod=hp_lead_pos1\">the Wall Street Journal</a> disclosed devastating new details of a phone conversation between Trump and Zelenskiy on 25 July. The paper reported that Trump pressed \u201cabout eight times\u201d for his opposite number to look into work in the country by Biden\u2019s son Hunter.</p> <p>And, the Journal wrote, Trump explicitly urged Zelenskiy to work with one person in forwarding the mission: Rudy Giuliani.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb72057e9badbfb5949628724914845b02649d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb72057e9badbfb5949628724914845b02649d0/535_1238_3962_2378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump is reported to have pressed the Ukrainian president \u2018about eight times\u2019 to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump is reported to have pressed the Ukrainian president \u2018about eight times\u2019 to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That Trump would be willing to attract further legal scrutiny just months after Mueller wrapped up his work, by inviting yet another foreign government to assist him in a presidential election campaign, is profoundly puzzling. After all, he partly brought the Mueller inquiry down upon his own head by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-putin-no-relationship-226282\">inviting Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in July 2016</a>.</p> <p>But if Trump\u2019s actions are peculiar, they are nothing compared with Giuliani\u2019s. For the past five months he has been telling anyone prepared to listen about his attempts to enlist Ukraine as a partner in Trump\u2019s re-election.</p> <p>Giuliani began thumping the Ukraine theme in April, when he laid out his theory \u2013 some would say, conspiracy theory \u2013 on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trumps-communications-with-foreign-leader-are-part-of-whistleblower-complaint-that-spurred-standoff-between-spy-chief-and-congress-former-officials-say/2019/09/18/df651aa2-da60-11e9-bfb1-849887369476_story.html\">Fox News</a>. He accused the former vice-president of using bribery to shield his son from legal peril relating to business activities in the eastern European country.</p> <p>Specifically, Giuliani alleged that Biden leant on a former Ukraine president to fire a top prosecutor who had been investigating corruption within a gas company on whose board Hunter Biden then served.</p> <p>A week after Joe Biden launched his presidential campaign, Giuliani blabbed to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/us/politics/biden-son-ukraine.html\">New York Times</a> that he had discussed the issue of the Bidens and Ukraine with Trump on \u201cmultiple occasions\u201d. He also divulged that he planned to make a trip to Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian president.</p> <p>Under US law, it is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EllenLWeintraub/status/1139309394968096768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1139309394968096768&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2019%2F6%2F14%2F18677631%2Ftrump-campaign-finance-law-fec-illegal-fbi\">categorically illegal</a> for anybody to solicit the help of any foreign national \u2013 let alone a government \u2013 for a US election. Yet here was Giuliani blithely telling the same newspaper a week later his visit to Kyiv was intended to kickstart an investigation into the Bidens that could be helpful in next year\u2019s presidential race.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about it,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cSomebody could say it\u2019s improper \u2026 That information will be very, very helpful to my client.\u201d</p> <p>Giuliani cancelled his Kyiv trip. Instead, he travelled to Madrid in August, where he met a top Ukrainian official whom he \u201cstrongly urged\u201d to reopen the investigation into the Bidens.</p> <p>Perhaps most incendiary of all are suggestions Trump and Giuliani may have tried to encourage the Ukraine government to play ball by invoking US aid to the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe potentially most explosive issue here is whether the president essentially offered Ukraine a quid pro quo,\u201d said Richard Pildes, professor of constitutional law at New York University.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll provide substantial US foreign aid if you provide damaging information concerning Joe Biden or his son.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 October 2019 to correct the spelling of Kyiv.</p>",

America\u2019s Mayor has tied himself in ever-tighter knots over claims that at Trump\u2019s behest he improperly sought to coerce Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden in the hope of dredging up damaging information. No fewer than three House committees this week launched investigations into the Trump-Giuliani efforts in Ukraine. Though not yet on the scale of Mueller\u2019s inquiry into whether Trump colluded with Russia, the new uproar bears chilling echoes of it. At the heart of the row is the whistleblower complaint that was raised by an intelligence official on 12 August. Exactly what that complaint says is not yet known, but details have emerged that point the spotlight squarely at Ukraine. Reporting led by the Washington Post suggests the unnamed official was so alarmed by Trump\u2019s \u201ccommunications with a foreign leader\u201d \u2013 now thought to be Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2013 that he or she considered it a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal disclosed devastating new details of a phone conversation between Trump and Zelenskiy on 25 July. The paper reported that Trump pressed \u201cabout eight times\u201d for his opposite number to look into work in the country by Biden\u2019s son Hunter. And, the Journal wrote, Trump explicitly urged Zelenskiy to work with one person in forwarding the mission: Rudy Giuliani. That Trump would be willing to attract further legal scrutiny just months after Mueller wrapped up his work, by inviting yet another foreign government to assist him in a presidential election campaign, is profoundly puzzling. After all, he partly brought the Mueller inquiry down upon his own head by inviting Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in July 2016. But if Trump\u2019s actions are peculiar, they are nothing compared with Giuliani\u2019s. For the past five months he has been telling anyone prepared to listen about his attempts to enlist Ukraine as a partner in Trump\u2019s re-election. Giuliani began thumping the Ukraine theme in April, when he laid out his theory \u2013 some would say, conspiracy theory \u2013 on Fox News. He accused the former vice-president of using bribery to shield his son from legal peril relating to business activities in the eastern European country. Specifically, Giuliani alleged that Biden leant on a former Ukraine president to fire a top prosecutor who had been investigating corruption within a gas company on whose board Hunter Biden then served. A week after Joe Biden launched his presidential campaign, Giuliani blabbed to the New York Times that he had discussed the issue of the Bidens and Ukraine with Trump on \u201cmultiple occasions\u201d. He also divulged that he planned to make a trip to Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian president. Under US law, it is categorically illegal for anybody to solicit the help of any foreign national \u2013 let alone a government \u2013 for a US election. Yet here was Giuliani blithely telling the same newspaper a week later his visit to Kyiv was intended to kickstart an investigation into the Bidens that could be helpful in next year\u2019s presidential race. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about it,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cSomebody could say it\u2019s improper \u2026 That information will be very, very helpful to my client.\u201d Giuliani cancelled his Kyiv trip. Instead, he travelled to Madrid in August, where he met a top Ukrainian official whom he \u201cstrongly urged\u201d to reopen the investigation into the Bidens. Perhaps most incendiary of all are suggestions Trump and Giuliani may have tried to encourage the Ukraine government to play ball by invoking US aid to the country. \u201cThe potentially most explosive issue here is whether the president essentially offered Ukraine a quid pro quo,\u201d said Richard Pildes, professor of constitutional law at New York University. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ll provide substantial US foreign aid if you provide damaging information concerning Joe Biden or his son.\u2019\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 October 2019 to correct the spelling of Kyiv.",

      "bodyText": "7 April Rudy Giuliani alleges on Fox News that former vice-president Joe Biden was involved while in office in irregular activity in Ukraine. The lawyer claims Biden pressed for the dismissal of a top Ukrainian prosecutor who had been leading a corruption investigation into a gas company on whose board Biden\u2019s son Hunter had served. 25 April Biden launches his presidential campaign. 1 May The New York Times reports that Giuliani has been urging Ukraine to conduct a new investigation into the activities of Joe and Hunter Biden. \u201cGiuliani called Mr Trump excitedly to brief him on his findings,\u201d the paper says. 10 May Giuliani cancels a trip to Ukraine. He had planned to travel to Kiev to put pressure on President-elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy to reopen investigations, in the hope of dredging up dirt on the Bidens. The lawyer described the aim of his aborted visit as \u201cmeddling in an investigation\u201d and admitted \u201csomebody could say it\u2019s improper\u201d. 20 May Zelenskiy assumes the Ukrainian presidency. 25 July Key telephone call takes place, between Trump and Zelenskiy. The call now appears to be at the centre of the whistleblower complaint filed the following month. 12 August Whistleblower complaint is filed by a member of the intelligence community, raising an \u201curgent concern\u201d relating to the president\u2019s actions. 21 August Giuliani reveals that in August he travelled to Madrid to meet a top Ukrainian official, Andriy Yermak. He \u201cstrongly urged\u201d Yermak to reinvestigate the Bidens, among other matters. \u201cJust investigate the darn things,\u201d Giuliani says he told the official. The lawyer insists he is acting as a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d, though it later emerges the meeting was arranged with the help of Kurt Volker, US envoy to Ukraine. 9 September Leading Democrats in Congress write to the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, requesting all documents relating to any effort by Trump to put pressure on the Ukrainian government to help with his re-election bid. The letter accuses Trump and Giuliani of acting \u201coutside legitimate law enforcement and diplomatic channels\u201d to harm Biden\u2019s campaign. 13 September Adam Schiff, Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, subpoenas the Trump administration, demanding that the whistleblower complaint be handed over. Refusal to do so by the director of national intelligence, a Trump appointee, sparks an constitutional tug-of-war. 18 September The Washington Post reveals that the whistleblower complaint concerns Trump\u2019s \u201ccommunications with a foreign leader\u201d and a \u201cpromise\u201d that was regarded as \u201ctroubling\u201d. 19 September Giuliani is interviewed by Chris Cuomo on CNN and in a heated exchange at first denies that he asked Ukraine to investigate Biden. About 30 seconds later, he reverses himself. \u201cOf course I did,\u201d he says.",

In separate investigations into the same scheme, the justice minister of North-Rhine Westphalia said that Cologne prosecutors are now conducting 56 probes with a total of about 400 suspects related to cum-ex. More than 400 individuals and companies have been sued in connection with the scheme in Denmark. Estimated losses include an estimated \u20ac31.8 bn Germany, at least \u20ac17bn for France, \u20ac4.5bn in Italy, \u20ac1.7bn in Denmark and \u20ac201m for Belgium \u201cThe Cologne investigations have now reached a point that prosecutors say that cum-ex wasn\u2019t a legal tax-driven trading strategy, but organised white-collar crime of unimaginable magnitude,\u201d the minister said. The alleged architects of the scheme Hanno Berger A prominent German tax official turned tax lawyer whose past clients include the owners of BMW and companies like Adidas, Berger has been described as the mastermind behind the cum-ex scheme and was charged with tax fraud at a court in Wiesbaden last year. Based in Switzerland, he insists all of his dealings were within the law and has not appeared in court so far. Paul Robert Mora A 51-year-old Kiwi with a penchant for rugby and Hawaiian shirts, Mora had a background in tax law before moving into investment banking in the City of London. At HypoVereinsbank and his own investment vehicles Ballance Capital and Arunvill, Mora is alleged to have worked with Berger to construct a vast number of cum-ex trades. Believed to have returned to New Zealand, where he has property investments in Christchurch, Mora has also not appeared in the German courts to far. Sanjay Shah Shah is the key figure for investigations in Denmark, where prosecutors say the Briton defrauded the treasury to the tune of \u20ac1.3bn, mainly through his hedge fund Solo Capital LLP, by copying the system used by Berger. Shah has denied any wrongdoing. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 September 2019 to remove irrelevant material about Sanjay Shah and correct a detail about Martin Shields\u2019 court appearance.",

When the Trump administration moved to undo California\u2019s strict vehicle emissions standards this month, the state <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/19/california-trump-vehicle-emissions-standards-cars\">vowed to fight</a>. Governor Gavin Newsom hit back with, of course, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1174365760887513088\">a tweet</a>: \u201cWe will prevail. See you in court.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Earlier this week, the University of California <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2019/09/uc-divests-fossil-fuels-citing-finance-renewable-energy-climate-change/\">pledged to divest</a> over $80bn in endowment and pension funds from fossil fuel companies, citing the \u201cfinancial risk\u201d posed by the industry, compared to renewable energy. Climate advocates called it the biggest single commitment by any university, and perhaps the beginning of a new divesting trend. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>California cities, including Berkeley and San Jose, are leading the country with a wave of local laws to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/23/berkeley-natural-gas-ban-environment\">phase out natural gas</a> hook-ups in new construction, despite strong and well-funded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/26/us-natural-gas-ban-socalgas-berkeley\">opposition from the gas industry</a>. Natural gas is the greatest source of carbon emissions from buildings, while fully electrifying homes and businesses could allow them to run on clean, renewable energy instead.<br></p> \n  <p>California\u2019s municipalities have also taken direct aim at the industry responsible for so much of the climate crisis. Eight cities and counties in the state have filed civil lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, alleging public nuisance and in some cases negligence.

Leaders from around the world, including the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson; France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron; and India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, are expected at the summit as part of a major UN push to heighten the response to the escalating climate crisis.</p> \n  <p>UN sources said the booking of the room was relatively last minute and will cause some logistical issues given the major security operation that accompanies the US president wherever he goes. But a senior UN official said they were \u201cnot panicked\u201d given the large organizational capacity of the UN general assembly.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNo one was really expecting the president to come to the climate summit,\u201d the official said. It\u2019s understood that senior UN staff have realistic expectations of Trump and do not expect him to engage on the climate crisis, even for a summit held in his hometown.

climate action, which have drawn huge crowds around the world. <br></p> \n  <p>We expect the US will be staging its largest ever climate strike, with actions planned in more than 1,000 locations, including major rallies in New York, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami.<br></p> \n  <p>Here at the Guardian\u2019s New York office, members of our team in midtown Manhattan walked out at midday local time to participate in the strike. <br></p> \n  <p>Further downtown, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg will be leading a big strike rally which she is expected to speak at later in the day, ahead of addressing the UN\u2019s Climate Action Summit next week. <br></p> \n  <p>Activists are gathering in Foley Square, near City Hall, and will start marching south on Broadway at 1pm ET to rally in Battery park. <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea6f983535428c36d32c79c776f41271915f3b03\"> \n   <img

Most companies will be affected by climate chaos in some way, however: extreme weather events are already costing billions a year and those costs are not coming down soon. Foresighted companies will audit the risks they face and act to deal with them. If you work for a publicly listed company, you could try buying some shares and turning up at the AGM to ask questions about how they are dealing with climate risk. If you don\u2019t, more of your co-workers may be interested in the climate than you think: polls show a great majority of people in most countries are concerned about the climate crisis.</p> \n  <p>Dan from Tunbridge Wells asked:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>How will we make our nuclear power plants safe if this civilisation collapses? How does the hydrological cycle fit in?

As for hydrology, the effects of climate chaos are likely to be the wet areas of the world getting wetter and the dry areas getting drier, which is problematic. And as for nuclear power, some people - including the Guardian\u2019s George Monbiot - see it as an uncomfortable but perhaps necessary way out of the climate crisis, but the very long-term storage of nuclear waste is a problem still to be solved.</p> \n  <p> Kee from London asked:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>How much impact do long-haul flights have?

So, what role, if any, does solar activity (solar winds, solar flares, sunspots) play in climate change right now? Are we missing something, have we miscalculated or does the sun have nothing to do with climate change at this point?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Changes in the sun\u2019s activity are not causing the climate change and global heating we are currently experiencing. They are caused by human actions, chiefly burning fossil fuels and changing land use, as successive reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have conclusively shown. <br></p> \n  <p>Alex from Warwickshire asked:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The electrification of small vehicles is seen as an achievable near-term step towards cutting emissions, but to replace a significant fraction of the current fossil-fuelled fleet would presumably require a drastic increase in the global extraction and use of \u2018rare-earth\u2019 metals for battery manufacture. How well do we currently understand the environmental impact of such a change and are there more sustainable battery technologies on the horizon?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In the long term, availability of rare earths will be an important issue but it is equally important to note that there are no serious current supply problems as the manufacturing rates show. Batteries are one of the biggest areas of research and there are multiple avenues being explored, from nanotechnology to graphene and even aluminium, a common metal, as an alternative. Hydrogen fuel cells are another possibility.</p> \n  <p> Tracey from Ross-on-Wye asked:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Guy McPherson, an environmental scientist, argues that, due to the protection from the sun\u2019s heat attributable to global dimming, if we cut carbon emissions the Earth will heat faster, and the planet will be uninhabitable for any species within a decade. Why is this theory not spoken about or even mentioned by any other leading environmental voices?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Because it is wrong. The dimming of light from the sun owing to aerosols does have a small effect, but as you seem to be pointing out, many of the aerosols are soot, or black carbon. Black carbon actually adds to warming, especially when it falls on snow. Removing black carbon and other short-lived climate pollutants could reduce temperatures by as much as 0.5C as work by Durwood Zaelke and others has clearly shown.</p> \n  <p>You<a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/questions_fiona_harvey\"> can share your questions now via our form here,</a> or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they\u2019ll be easier for us to find.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T13:25:50.348Z\">at 2.25pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d84d1088f08f30dc5bbf1cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T13:19:38.874Z\">2.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Lyra Harris, six, from Islington, London, protesting outside 10 Downing Street, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Stop this nonsense.

Why not see this as an opportunity to engage pupils rather than turn them off?</p> \n  <p>Derek from West Sussex asked:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The UK has a good record of deploying offshore wind generation. What I don\u2019t understand is why we aren\u2019t deploying wave power and tidal power generation? We have the most coastline per head of any major European country. Wave power never stops, unlike wind, it is more energy dense than wind, and it could have other benefits like reducing coastal erosion.</p> \n   <p>Tidal power solutions likewise are always available and energy dense. There is an ecological cost in habitats but a balance is needed here. Do we really think that the ecological cost of a tidal barrier is worse than a nuclear power station? There is an ecological cost to farmland too, but we need to eat, so we cut down all the forests we had in medieval times to make room for agriculture. We just need to make some room for power generation too.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The UK is a world leader on offshore wind, as the latest green power auctions show. Wave and tidal power have proved more difficult, in the latter case partly owing to the changes that would be required to landscape a tidal lagoon. But as public subsidy is less needed for wind and solar as prices have come down, it might become possible to spend more of it on wave and tidal power \u2013 they may prove cheaper than the high costs agreed to by the government for nuclear energy.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T13:03:17.474Z\">at 2.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d84cb8c8f08f9df5bdd82a5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/josh-halliday\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T12:55:39.085Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, received a warm applause at the city\u2019s climate protest when he gave a speech pledging that \u201cfracking is the past, it is not the future\u201d \u2013 but by far the biggest cheers went to a 10-year-old girl called Lillia who took to the stage next.<br><br>The local schoolgirl, with a high-pitched Mancunian accent and fluorescent ear-defenders tied to her backpack, gave a rousing speech taking aim at politicians for their \u201clies\u201d \u2013 before turning directly to Burnham.<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Lies, when you don\u2019t count the airport in the emission figures!

Our knowledge of the harms of air pollution has expanded dramatically in the past few years: we now know air pollutants can be found in all human organs, and it is linked not only to respiratory problems and heart disease but also dementia, developmental problems and miscarriage.</p> \n  <p>In some ways, the cleaning up of air pollution is easier to explain than climate chaos because people can see and feel air pollution more clearly than the link between invisible carbon dioxide and extreme weather, and increasingly air pollution campaigners are making the link with climate benefits from moving away from coal and diesel in particular.</p> \n  <p>Louis from London asked: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Today is wonderful to see - the energy and passion - but how can you be sure we haven\u2019t left it too late ?

But there is still time to stave off the worst effects if we take action on emissions now.</p> \n  <p>The IPCC has said emissions must be effectively zero by around mid-century to hold the world to no more than 1.5C of warning, and every effort to bring down emissions helps towards that goal. But there are scary things we know less about: tipping points, which could cause runaway heating to take hold. These include Arctic sea ice melt, which reveals dark sea instead of reflective ice, creating more warming, and the melting permafrost that releases methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, in a vicious circle. <br></p> \n  <p>Some have suggested we turn our efforts to adapting to climate change instead of cutting emissions. But adapting without cutting emissions is like trying to mop up an overflowing sink with the taps still running. The truth is we need to do both, and urgently.</p> \n  <p>You<a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/questions_fiona_harvey\"> can share your questions now via our form here,</a> or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they\u2019ll be easier for us to find.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T13:19:43.444Z\">at 2.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d84c46b8f08f9df5bdd8241\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mark-rice-oxley\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T12:37:36.375Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Just to stand back from the breathless enthusiasm of the protests for a moment, our environment editor, Damian Carrington, has been pulling out a series of charts that highlight the scale of the challenge - and the beginnings of some solutions.</p> \n  <p>Perhaps the most important one is this: the planet\u2019s average temperature started a steady climb two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen.

The science is clear that, without urgent action, sea levels will rise further, extreme temperatures will become the norm and climate-related disasters will inflict even greater damage. We are making historic investments to prepare and adapt our cities to the inevitable consequences of emissions already released into the atmosphere.</p> \n   <p>When your house is on fire, somebody needs to sound the alarm. Young people in our cities, displaying incredible maturity and dignity are doing just that. School children are taking to the streets, drawing attention to the terrifying threat that climate breakdown poses to their future. Young people recognise just how unfair climate change is. Those who have generated the least greenhouse gas emissions, including the poorest, most disadvantaged and youngest in society, will suffer the worst effects of a rapidly changing global climate. They are right to sound the alarm, and they are right to demand action that tackles climate change and inequality simultaneously. </p> \n   <p>On September 20, these inspiring young leaders have called for adults to join them for a Global Climate Strike. We have an opportunity to show, not only that we hear their message, but that they have inspired us to act even faster. </p> \n   <p>As mayors, our greatest responsibility is to protect the lives and wellbeing of those that live in our cities. As adults, our obligation is to leave the world in a better state for our children than we inherited it. Fortunately, the evidence is increasingly clear that transforming our cities to prevent the climate crisis will also make them healthier, more equitable, safer and ultimately better places to live. The cities of the future will enjoy affordable and reliable public transport; the air will be free from poisonous toxins; buildings will generate zero emissions thanks to ultra-high efficient heating, cooling and insulation; waste will be recycled or reused, and all of this will be powered by abundant renewable energy. We have a unique opportunity to bestow a bright and hopeful legacy to the next generation. This is the future we want.</p> \n   <p>That is why we are supporting the Global Climate Strikes. Mayors around the world, working through C40 Cities, are committed to deliver on the Paris Agreement and taking action to peak their emissions as our cities already have and bring them down sharply by 2030. Many businesses, investors, labour groups, faith leaders and local communities share our urgency. But we cannot tackle the climate crisis alone. We need science-based action from every sector of the economy, and we expect greater leadership from nation states.

An umbrella organisation that includes organisations such as \u201cPsychologists for Future\u201d, \u201cEntrepreneurs for Future\u201d and \u201cGrandparents for Future\u201d has called for people to join in, as has the services union Verdi and the German Protestant Church. \u201cWe stand side by side with Fridays for Future\u201d, said Annette Kurschus, the president of the Protestant Church of Westphalia, \u201cPlanet Earth does not belong to us, it has only been entrusted in our care\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Germany has two faces when it comes to the environment: the country that prides itself in its high recycling rates, phasing out nuclear power and pioneering renewable energies is still the world\u2019s sixth biggest pollutant, with 865m tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2018.</p> \n  <p>Borne out of this realisation, much of the recent debate in the country has focused on the phase-out of the country\u2019s approximately 130 smoke-belching coal plants. The government wants to close them down by 2038 \u2013 too soon for many unions, especially in the coal-rich east, and too late for climate activists galvanised by Fridays for Future. In Europe\u2019s \u201ccar nation\u201d, air pollution through exhaust fumes is another contentious issue, with some cities having introduced driving bans for diesel cars last year.</p> \n  <p>The Fridays for Future protests have had a tangible effect on the political climate, with several polls earlier this year showing the Green party emerging as the strongest political force in the country. Many other parties have tried to copy its message, with even the arch-conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union calling for a coal phase-out by 2030, bans on plastic bags and new wind farms.

Designing and building a 100% renewable energy system is a huge challenge for Australia. I think Australians are up for the challenge. Your home state of South Australia has solar and wind already providing over half of the electricity supplied to South Australians. </p> \n   <p>In planning for 100% renewables, the first 50% is easier than the second 50%. Solar and wind generation follow the sun and the wind, so when it is not sunny and windy we can\u2019t produce power for customers.</p> \n   <p>I reckon that above about 50% renewables for Australia we need to find ways to move the power from the sun and the wind to dark and still times, or use it immediately.</p> \n   <p>One way we do this is storage. Already we have two of the largest batteries in the country in Victoria, and we are working on two large pumped hydro projects \u2013 one of which is in your state of South Australia.</p> \n   <p>Another way we are exploring is helping customers use power when it is available from the sun and the wind. We can time pool pumps and hot water systems to run just through these times.</p> \n   <p>There\u2019s a long way to go but we like tackling tough problems, like the second 50%.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T03:30:49.998Z\">at 4.30am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d8443738f08f9df5bdd7eb7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helen-davidson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-20T03:12:26.615Z\">4.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In Sydney Daisy, 17, tells the crowd their frustration has never been about people working in the fossil-fuel industry.

The Stanwell Corporation is one of Australia\u2019s biggest energy companies. EnergyAustralia and Stanwell were the only members of <a href=\"http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/NGER/Pages/Published%20information/Data%20highlights/2017%E2%80%9318-published-data-highlights.aspx\">Australia\u2019s top 10 carbon emitters</a> who agreed to take a question for our live blog today. </p> \n  <p><strong>Narii Hamill-Salmon</strong>, 15, from the Gold Coast asks: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The Stanwell Corporation was named as the nation\u2019s third largest carbon emitter in 2017-18 [by the Clean Energy Regulator] thus making the company a significant contributor to the climate crisis.</p> \n   <p>Mr Van Breda, if you could say one thing to the future generations of this planet, the ones who are going to experience the most devastating impacts of climate change, what would you tell them?\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Richard Van Breda, </strong>chief executive:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Thanks for your question, Narii. I think a lot about that, and here\u2019s what I would tell future generations about the work we do at Stanwell.</p> \n   <p>The electricity industry is at a tricky time in its transition to lower carbon technologies. The proportion of low carbon energy and storage in Australia is increasing quickly, but those technologies are not yet at a point where they can function without support from fossil fuel generation.</p> \n   <p>As a company that operates coal-fired power stations, it\u2019s Stanwell\u2019s job to provide the electricity that people need, as the industry moves to a lower carbon future. That change can\u2019t happen immediately and needs to be planned and done carefully.</p> \n   <p>We ramp generation from our coal-fired power stations up and down every day to support solar generation in the middle of the day, and still provide the electricity people need in the evenings. </p> \n   <p>We are also exploring new generation and storage technology that will help reduce emissions. I\u2019m really proud of the work Stanwell people are doing in all those areas.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

Sea walls to protect vulnerable communities are being constructed \u2013 from the former gold-mining town of Hokitika on the west coast to vulnerable beachside huts in the isolated far north.

      "bodyText": "For the past 24 hours, the Guardian has been reporting in real time as millions of people joined in a worldwide, youth-led climate strike \u2013 with correspondents filing dispatches from the demonstrations across the globe. We\u2019re ending our liveblog here , but not our commitment to covering the climate crisis. Read our roundup of the historic day of action: A moment of appreciation for the doggos These puppers want action on climate change right now. And maybe also a treat, please? Thousands of tech employees walked out of their workplaces to join the climate strike Workers from Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter staged walkouts in what may be the largest coordinated worker action in the history of the tech industry. At the demonstration in Seattle, more than 3,000 tech workers walked out of their workplaces on Friday and thousands more joined actions across the country, according to Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, a group calling for Amazon to make more effort to address climate change. Globally, more than 1,800 Amazon employees walked out across 25 cities and 14 countries on Friday to protest the company\u2019s failure to take more action to address the climate crisis. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s CEO, has made some efforts to address climate concerns, including an announcement on Thursday that the company expects to be carbon neutral by 2040 and a February announcement of a goal, known as Shipment Zero, to be carbon neutral on 50% of shipments by 2030. But workers are asking for more: zero emissions by 2030, increasing the number of electric vehicles in its fleet, and refusing to set contracts with companies that damage the climate. \u201cAmazon still has a long way to go,\u201d said Danilo Quilaton, product designer at Amazon in San Francisco. \u201cWhat kind of climate leader can we be if we\u2019re still partnering with fossil fuel companies, selling our AI technologies to extract oil faster?\u201d Other tech companies were present at marches in San Francisco and beyond. Twitter workers walked out, marching alongside workers from tech payment firm Square in San Francisco. Facebook workers walked out of offices around the country, including employees who left the headquarters in San Jose. More than 1,800 workers at Google signed a pledge supporting climate action from the company, including zero emissions by 2030, eliminating contracts with oil and gas companies, and promising zero harm to climate refugees. Hundreds walked out of Google offices across the US, including in New York City and at the headquarters in San Jose. \u201cAs individuals, we may feel alone in facing climate change,\u201d the Google petition said. \u201cBut if we act together \u2013 if we act now \u2013 we can build a better future.\u201d Amazon workers join the climate strike Hundreds of Amazon workers left their desks Friday to join a thousands-strong climate strike march in Seattle. Workers rallied in front of Amazon\u2019s focal point \u2013 the Amazon Spheres, geodesic glass terrariums marking the company\u2019s center of gravity in downtown Seattle \u2013 before marching to city hall. The mood was light, their march well ordered and rife with signage playing on Amazon slogans, including \u201cCustomer Obsessed = Climate Obsessed\u201d. Those gathered joked that they were skipping a lunch at their desks to join the noontime protest. The grim realities of the climate crisis were mentioned, particularly the challenges facing Amazon warehouse workers in southern California, but the 2,000-or-so workers and throngs of supporters were prepared to celebrate. They\u2019d won, after all, Amazon\u2019s first broad pledge to contain its carbon footprint. EVAN: Bobbing along with a stream of colleagues, Evan Pulgino was awestruck. Pulgino, a software engineer from Pittsburgh who arrived in Seattle three years ago to work at Amazon, was a face in the crowd of several thousand Amazon and Google employees and their supporters. Badges colored to mark seniority, standard at Amazon, hung from lanyards and fobs. Having set out from the Amazon Spheres in downtown Seattle, the tech crowd merged with throngs of high schoolers arriving on Fifth Avenue to join the march on Seattle\u2019s City Hall. Pulgino described the disparate mass of humanity \u2013 Amazon\u2019s orderly herd of 20s and 30-somethings mixing with exuberant teens \u2013 as \u201cincredible\u201d. Pulgino, who has been active on climate issues since October, said he was cheered by the commitment made Thursday by Amazon to attain zero net carbon emissions by 2040. It was a start, he said, and a heartening one. Pulgino objected to Amazon\u2019s continued financial support for climate change-denying thinktanks and politicians, and to Amazon Web Services\u2019 contracts with fossil fuel companies. \u201cIt was important to be part of the fight,\u201d said Pulgino, carrying a sign that read \u201cStop funding climate denial, start leading for zero emissions\u201d. \u201cTech drives so much change,\u201d the 38-year-old continued. \u201cIf Amazon leads the way, other companies will follow.\u201d ROSHNI: Roshni Naidu, a five-year Amazon veteran, expected something out of Finding Nemo when last year she traveled to Australia to take in the Great Barrier Reef. Naidu, 28, was shocked to find a graying, vacant space. \u201cIt was nothing at all like what I expected,\u201d said Naidu, a senior technical product manager. Returning to Seattle shaken by witnessing the degradation of the planet, Naidu got to work at her work. She began agitating with other Amazon employees for the company to get it right on climate change. Amazon, she said, can lead on climate. She described herself as \u201ccautiously celebratory\u201d after company leaders announced a suite of climate change-related reforms aimed at eliminating Amazon\u2019s carbon footprint by 2040. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that collective action works,\u201d Naidu said. Friday\u2019s march, she added, \u201cputs even more pressure on Amazon to do more.\u201d It\u2019s great, she said, to be able to say she\u2019s \u201csaving the world\u201d. NICK: Milling among his climate activist colleagues, Nick Andrews, a program manager now in his sixth year at Amazon, was ready to scream. Which, as a chant leader, was his job for the afternoon. Andrews, 32, had been active for months pushing Amazon to reduce its climate footprint and cut ties to the fossil fuel industry. Like several of his colleagues, he struck a tone more disappointed than angry. Amazon workers tend to believe their company can do anything, including save the planet. At the outset, Andrews said, pushing the sometimes autocratic company seemed like it would be nerve-racking work. It didn\u2019t turn out that way. \u201cEveryone came in with trepidation,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really received a company-wide embrace.\u201d It helps, he said, that he and other Amazonians turn out \u2013 unsurprisingly to those who\u2019ve watched the company come to dominate the retail economy and cloud computing \u2013 to be \u201cvery good organizers\u201d. He celebrated on Thursday when Amazon leaders announced a series of steps designed to eliminate Amazon\u2019s net carbon footprint. He looks forward to Amazon doing more, though. \u201cWe pride ourselves on being a bar-pushing company,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThis is a good start, but I think we can do better.\u201d The Guardian has partnered with Friends of the Earth to highlight the climate crisis and raise funds for the charity, which is doing so much to address the damage that has been done and continues to be done to the planet. Scenes from Richmond, California \u2013 a town under Chevron\u2019s shadow The main climate strike action in the Bay Area today was in the center of San Francisco, always a magnet for regional progressive activism. But across the bay, Richmond, population 110,000, more than held its own. The small crowd at the city\u2019s civic center peaked at about 100 before a short youth-led march. Speakers took turns addressing the group from atop a park bench, rallying with call-and-response chants and songs, and impromptu speeches about factory farming, a Green New Deal and geoengineering. But while this may have been a small branch of a global day of action, the main thrust here was local issues, as residents shared updates on local organizing efforts to stop the climate pollution happening in their own town. Richmond is actually younger than the 117-year-old, 2,900 acre Chevron oil refinery that occupies much of the city\u2019s scenic bayside hillscape, and the fossil fuel giant has long exerted outsized influence not just over the city\u2019s environment, but also its politics. Richmond also feels the impact of over a million tons of coal and petroleum byproducts exported from its bayside terminal each year \u2013 the city\u2019s asthma rates are far above those of other Bay Area communities. Urgency on the global climate crisis won the day worldwide, but in Richmond and other front-line cities, the impacts of the fossil fuel industry and issues of environmental justice feel even more immediately dire. \u2018It is like they are burning our soul\u2019: Brazil\u2019s indigenous people call for international help At the third Rio de Janeiro demonstration of the day, Tereza Arapiun, a chief from the Arapiun tribe from the Amazon state of Par\u00e1, called for international help for Brazil\u2019s indigenous people. \u201cWe are surrounded by destruction, loggers and mining,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need help.\u201d Amazon deforestation, fires and land invasions worsened under Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro, she said. \u201cHe encourages it. Before, there was protection. He destroyed it.\u201d Arapiun welled up as she told how a friend described hearing the screams of dying animals as fires raged recently near Alter do Ch\u00e3o, a renowned beauty spot in the same state. \u201cIt is very painful. It is like they are burning our soul,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need help \u2013 and help won\u2019t come from Brazil.\u201d Colombian demonstrators demand a world \u201cwithout plastic and without war\u201d Demonstrators have begun to gather at parks and squares across Colombia now. Here in Bogot\u00e1 \u2013 the capital \u2013 the historic Plaza de Bol\u00edvar in front of the congress building is slowly drawing crowds despite the rain. \u201cColombia, our land,\u201d one group of students chanted as they arrived. \u201cWithout plastic and without war!\u201d Near the statue of the country\u2019s independence hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, demonstrators banged drums and burnt incense, waving signs that read \u201cRebel or burn out\u201d. \u201cWhen the problem is as urgent as climate change, it\u2019s only by coming together that we can make a difference,\u201d said Alejandra Moreno, a student from Bogot\u00e1. Unlike many similar events around the world, this one was not preceded by a major strike and schools were open as normal. This could be because events got little publicity in local media. The two main dailies, El Espectador and El Tiempo, ran agency-written stories online on worldwide strikes that did not once mention Colombia. Instead, the mantle to promote today\u2019s march was picked up by an opposition political party, Colombia Humana, and local environmental activists. Both used social media extensively. \u201cWhy in London are people so willing to move to pressure their government and the world for drastic measures to attack the climate crisis and not in Colombia, if the problem is the same?\u201d the senator Gustavo Petro \u2013 the leader of Colombia Humana and a former presidential candidate \u2013 tweeted this morning. \u201cBecause of something called asymmetrical information: in Colombia the danger is ignored.\u201d Colombia has made efforts to position itself as a regional leader on environmental issues, recently hosting a summit in its Amazonian city Leticia, where Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru agreed on measures to tackle the nearby raging rainforest fires. However, local activists say it is just window-dressing given that Colombia remains one of the most dangerous countries for environmentalists. Twenty-four environmental activists were murdered here in 2018, second only to the Philippines, according to the watchdog Global Witness. \u201cColombia is living through constant threats of damage to ecosystems and deforestation, and our cities are heating up,\u201d said Isabel Cristina Zuleta, an environmental activist with the Rios Vivos movement, who has received many death threats for her work. She was attending a march in Medell\u00edn, Colombia\u2019s second largest city. \u201cIn Colombia, to protest and to march is to put yourself at risk,\u201d Zuleta said. \u201cThat\u2019s why today it is so important to see people in the streets.\u201d Protesters in Miami Beach wrap it up, head to \u201cEnd of the World\u201d after party The climate strike has wrapped up in Miami Beach after a \u201chistoric\u201d day that saw thousands of schoolchildren, college students and workers gather at two events at city hall. But organizers say this is just the start of something much bigger. \u201cYou saw how many people were here, it was incredible,\u201d said youth climate activist John Paul Mejia, who spoke at the morning school strike and evening rally for those who couldn\u2019t take time off during the day. \u201cNow we need to keep the conversation going, to build on this historic day and get things done.\u201d The Miami protestors were heading for an after-strike party with live music at a bar in nearby Overtown arranged by 350southflorida, an environmental group. The relaxation will be short, however. Next week\u2019s planned protest activities include a sit-in at Miami Beach\u2019s sustainability committee meeting and a strike in downtown Miami at Chase Bank, which 350southflorida says is the world\u2019s biggest funder of fossil fuels. The \u201cweek of action\u201d wraps up with an End of the World party on the second Global Climate Strike day next Friday. Young activists in Brazil: less CO2, more vida There were small demonstrations across Brazil on Friday. In the morning, dozens of school and university students occupied the steps of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s state legislature in hot sun. They sang, waved placards and called for the removal of business-friendly environment minister Ricardo Salles. Striking high school student Maria Hardman, 15, was angry over far-right president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s failure to protect the Amazon. \u201cHe does not value the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cBolsonaro is an imbecile. He does not represent me.\u201d Brazilians have yet to grasp the scale of the climate emergency, said Mariana Imp\u00e9rio, 30, a masters student at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Thalita Alves, 20, a trainee teacher at the Federal Fluminense University, said people began waking up when fires in the Bolivian Amazon caused S\u00e3o Paulo skies to darken. \u201cBrazilians who voted for Bolsonaro \u2026 faithfully believe what he says,\u201d she said. Later another demonstration marched from Ibama, the environmental agency, to the city centre. High school students formed a human mosaic reading: \u201cSave the Amazon\u201d in Recife and held up placards with data on Amazon fires in Salvador. Students marched in the town of Novo Friburgo and in the capital Bras\u00edlia, an SOS Amazon banner was hung on the walls of the environment ministry. In the Amazon city of Bel\u00e9m, hundreds gathered beside the Maraj\u00f3 Bay. \u201cComing from the Amazon, I feel it\u2019s a duty to fight,\u201d said Lidia Seabra, 24, studying a masters in biology at the Federal University of Par\u00e1. \u201cWe are united here to defend the Amazon,\u201d said engineering student Devyison de Jesus, 21. In S\u00e3o Paulo, a few thousand blocked Paulista Avenue after cheering speeches from children such as Cora Ramos, 10, who held up a placard she had made that read \u201cthere is no planet B\u201d. \u201cIf we destroy this one, there won\u2019t be another,\u201d she said. Brazilian activists were also present at marches abroad. Alessandra Munduruku, an indigenous activist from the Munduruku tribe of Par\u00e1 state, made a short, powerful speech to an enormous crowd in Berlin. \u201cMy people are grateful to have good people fighting and defending the Amazon,\u201d she said through a translator to deafening cheers. \u201cI saw many children, many young people, parents, old people, I thought that demonstration was very beautiful,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI had goosebumps.\u201d Mexico City protestors to AMLO: \u201cWe want a future, not hydrocarbons!\u201d Climate protests started early outside the National Palace in central Mexico City, where President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador usually holds a daily press conference. The president \u2013 commonly called AMLO \u2013 was instead in the state of Yuct\u00e1n on Friday and didn\u2019t speak of the climate issue. But he boasted, \u201cThe fall in [Mexican] petroleum production has stopped and we\u2019re starting to produce more petroleum. ... We\u2019re now producing more petrol in Mexico\u2019s refineries.\u201d AMLO has bet big on boosting Mexico\u2019s petroleum output and promised to lower the price of gasoline. He\u2019s also pushed ahead with plans to build an $8bn refinery in the state of Tabasco \u2013 even starting construction prior to completing the environmental permits. AMLO also cancelled an electricity auction, which would have allowed more renewable energy into the market, and the Federal Electricity Commission (CRE) has announced plans to instead burn more coal. \u201cThere a campaign that renewables are cheaper and it\u2019s a lie,\u201d CFE director Manuel Bartlett said earlier this year. The government\u2019s focus on fossil fuels has put in question the country\u2019s commitment to generate 35% of its energy with renewables by 2024, according to climate change analysts. Marchers in Mexico City targeted AMLO, chanting, \u201cWe want a future, not hydrocarbons!\u201d Greta Thunberg: \u201cChange is coming whether they like it or not.\u201d The crowd in Battery Park roared in anticipation of Greta Thunberg, who was introduced by Alexandria Villase\u00f1or, Thunberg\u2019s NYC equivalent who her spends her Fridays protesting outside the UN headquarters in New York City. \u201cGreta! Greta! Greta!\u201d the crowd chanted as Thunberg got on the stage. The 16-year-old started her speech off by marking the number of people who participated in the strike around the world. In New York City, 250,000 people marched. Worldwide, more than 4m demonstrated. Thunberg\u2019s directed her speech to the hundreds of students in the crowd, though she acknowledged that adults also skipped worked to strike. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse, even if it means skipping school or work, because this is more important,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cWhy should we study for a future that is being taken away from us?\u201d Thunberg had to pause her speech twice to point out that people in the crowd needed medical attention. Many people had been in the sun all afternoon waiting for Thunberg to speak. The crowd patiently waited for Thunberg to start speaking again, each time cheering when she continued. Thunberg elicited laughter when she described all the politicians she had met who asked for selfies and \u201ctell us they really, really admire what we do\u201d yet have done nothing to address the climate crisis. \u201cWe demand a safe future. Is that really to much to ask?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d the crowd shouted back. At the end of her speech, Thunberg emphasized that the strikes around the world are just the start of change. \u201cIf you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, we have some very bad news for you, because this is only the beginning,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cChange is coming whether they like it or not.\u201d Students in the crowd said they felt moved seeing Thunberg speak in person. \u201cI started crying. I just found it powerful and empowering,\u201d said Juliana Rubiano, 16. \u201cShe represents a lot of people, and that\u2019s us, that\u2019s the youth.\u201d Californians are no strangers to the climate crisis fight \u2013 and now they\u2019re taking on the federal government California is not a place that requires convincing that the climate is changing. The people here don\u2019t even need to see the science \u2014 they\u2019re feeling the impacts firsthand, as the state teeters between an eroding coastline and growing wildland fires. Perhaps because of its many vulnerabilities, California has taken arguably the strongest stance of any US state in fighting the climate crisis, at times also fighting with the federal government in the process. When the Trump administration moved to undo California\u2019s strict vehicle emissions standards this month, the state vowed to fight. Governor Gavin Newsom hit back with, of course, a tweet: \u201cWe will prevail. See you in court.\u201d Earlier this week, the University of California pledged to divest over $80bn in endowment and pension funds from fossil fuel companies, citing the \u201cfinancial risk\u201d posed by the industry, compared to renewable energy. Climate advocates called it the biggest single commitment by any university, and perhaps the beginning of a new divesting trend. California cities, including Berkeley and San Jose, are leading the country with a wave of local laws to phase out natural gas hook-ups in new construction, despite strong and well-funded opposition from the gas industry. Natural gas is the greatest source of carbon emissions from buildings, while fully electrifying homes and businesses could allow them to run on clean, renewable energy instead. California\u2019s municipalities have also taken direct aim at the industry responsible for so much of the climate crisis. Eight cities and counties in the state have filed civil lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, alleging public nuisance and in some cases negligence. The suits seek billions of dollars in damages to help mitigate climate impacts. Maanvi Singh, here \u2014 taking up the Guardian\u2019s live climate strike coverage from the West Coast. Coming up, West Coast environment correspondent Susie Cagle will be sharing sketches and scenes from the demonstration in Richmond, California, across the bay from San Francisco. A Chevron refinery older than the town itself looms over it, and the area is home to some of the boldest climate-minded activism in California. Technology reporter Kari Paul will be following up on climate walkouts at Amazon, Twitter, Facebook and Google. And Los Angeles correspondent Sam Levin will bring us dispatches from the protests in southern California. Mexico City protests: thousands take to the streets Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Mexico City to join the global climate strike this afternoon. \u201cSe ve, se siente, la tierra est\u00e1 caliente,\u201d the crowds shouted as they processed down the city\u2019s main avenue, Reforma towards its presidential palace. \u201cYou see it, you feel it. The earth is getting hotter.\u201d Protesters - many of them school children and teenagers - carried homemade banners reading: \u201cThere\u2019s no money in a dead earth\u201d and \u201cAction now!\u201d One placard urged demonstrators to make love, not CO2. There were reports of other demonstrations, big and small, across Mexico in cities including Acapulco, Irapuato, Guadalajara and Tijuana. Unlike in Brazil, where far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has ignored today\u2019s movement, the protests received the blessing of the Mexican government which tweeted its support. In a Twitter video Victor Toledo, Mexico\u2019s environment secretary, urged the country to reflect on the environment \u201cinsurgency\u201d taking place around the world and to take action where possible. \u2018There is no Planet B\u2019 Best friends Amaya Mejia, 10, and Scarlett Harrison, 11, skipped school together to join the Miami Beach youth climate strike, after staying up late the night before to craft their placards. Amaya opted for a globe with the simple message: \u201cThere is no Planet B\u201d. \u201cYou need to listen to us, it\u2019s the only planet we\u2019ve got and we need to protect it,\u201d said Amaya, who attends the Gulliver private school in Coral Gables. Messages on banners ranged from simple and effective like Amaya\u2019s, to the deeply political and often comical. \u201cThe government can regulate my uterus but not single-use plastics?\u201d read one. Another student held aloft a sign informing the crowd: \u201cI\u2019m not showing up for school because adults aren\u2019t showing up for children,\u201d while another said: \u201cYou\u2019ll die of old age, I\u2019ll die of climate change.\u201d More locally-themed placards, referencing the threat of sea level rise to Miami Beach, a hugely popular tourism destination, included one that read: \u201cTake a stand before our city is all sand.\u201d My favorite, however, was perhaps the most understated message of the day. \u201cI\u2019m very upset,\u201d it read. Covering Climate Now Covering the climate crisis is absolutely core to the Guardian\u2019s editorial mission. And all this week, we have been a lead partner in Covering Climate Now, an initiative founded earlier this year with the Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation. This has led to more than 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries \u2013 with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people \u2013 signing on to amplify and share content on climate change. There has been a burst of coverage this week on the Guardian and beyond ahead of the UN climate summit next week on Monday 23 September. Check out some of our pieces this week including: The silenced: meet the climate whistleblowers muzzled by Trump The sinking class: the New Yorkers left to fight the climate crisis alone How TV weathercasters became the unsung heroes of the climate crisis \u2018Like a sunburn on your lungs\u2019: how does the climate crisis impact health? Thousands of people are striking in Boston, Massachusetts Organizers expected some 10,000 people to rally at City Hall Plaza for the Boston Climate Strike organized by youth climate activists. Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu and former Environmental Protection Agency head Gina McCarthy were among scheduled speakers, according to NBC10 Boston. Miami striker: \u2018Does it matter if we\u2019re under 15 feet of water or 50 feet?\u2019 Dan Gelber, the mayor of Miami Beach, received a warmer reception than any politician might have expected when he emerged to address the hundreds of student climate campaigners making a racket right outside his office window. Perhaps it\u2019s the $500m dollars his city is investing over the next five years to combat the effects of sea level rise, which already leaves neighborhoods under water during higher than usual tides. Scientists predict up to a three feet sea level rise by 2050. Gelber pointed out the strides already taken to improve things on this island city barely seven by one miles in size: an aggressive program of elevating roads and laying larger capacity drainage pipes, along with investing in modern pump equipment and technology to faster shift the rising flood waters. It\u2019s little wonder the environmentally-conscious city\u2019s slogan is Rising Above. And today the Miami Herald reported on what could become the city\u2019s most ambitious project yet, a proposal to turn the city-owned golf course into a 115-acre wetland park, which the newspaper says is certain to test the boundaries of what the public will accept in the name of resilience. \u201cChange is never easy,\u201d Miami Beach commissioner Ricky Arriola said. \u201cIf we\u2019re truly serious about dealing with climate change then everything is on the table, including the golf course. If we\u2019re not willing to even talk about it then we\u2019re just paying lip service.\u201d Gabriella Marchesani, 17, organizer of the Miami Beach youth climate strike, praises the city\u2019s efforts but says more needs to be done to address the causes of the climate crisis as well as dealing with its effects. \u201cMiami Beach has spent a lot of money on adaptation, it can be the leading city and we hope other cities in Florida will follow,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this cannot be done slowly, and we need climate policy. Does it matter if we\u2019re under 15 feet of water or 50 feet?\u201d Thousands converge on Battery Park, New York Most New York strikers have now made it down to Battery Park where a stage has been set up close to the water. Hundreds of people are packed around the stage, Greta is slated to speak, and many more are camped out sitting on the grass in the park. Young speakers took the stage giving personal testimonies of how the climate crisis is affecting them, denouncing politicians on both sides, saying just believing the facts isn\u2019t enough without action. When Jaden Smith took the stage, people started running the stage. In between two songs he reminded the crowd: \u201cWe gotta show people we care about this.\u201d Climate meme power Dorian victims convinced of link to climate change Reporting from the hurricane-hit Bahamas last week, I met David Dean, a sous chef at one of its holiday resorts. \u201cMy wife and kids had me as \u2018dead\u2019 on Facebook because they couldn\u2019t find me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I called them, there was a lot of crying.\u201d Like many in these Caribbean islands, Dean is convinced that the climate crisis in making hurricanes such as Dorian more likely and more intense. \u201cIt was very hot,\u201d the 38-year-old said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the hurricane was coming to us. Heat brings the hurricane and makes it worse.\u201d Some 52 people are confirmed dead in the Bahamas, a figure expected to rise, and more than 1,300 are still missing. The scale of destruction was astonishing, as if a giant with a child\u2019s temperament had run amok, flipping over cars and buses like toys. As so often, the underclass suffers the most. The science is complex but this Guardian article explains how global heating made Dorian bigger, wetter and deadlier. Many in the Bahamas are determined to stay the course, not least because tourism is so crucial to the economy. The owners of the hard hit Treasure Cay beach, marine and golf resort declared their intention to rebuild. But some residents also expressed concern that such efforts could be undone by the next hurricane, and the one after that. For now the Bahamas is dealing with scars, mental and physical. Dean told me: \u201cNow, if I feel a little rain, it might be drive me crazy. I\u2019m traumatised. I don\u2019t ever want to go through that again.\u201d This video is great at capturing some of the scale of the New York action. Which countries contribute most to the climate crisis? How much is the US to blame? China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US, the European Union, India and Russia. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China\u2019s carbon footprint. What has happened to the US Environmental Protection Agency with climate change? The EPA has begun efforts to eliminate climate rules for power plants, cars and the methane leaked from oil and gas facilities. Has the US already pulled out of the Paris accord? What if Democrats win next election? The US has not yet exited the international accord, in which every other nation on earth agreed to voluntarily begin to curb emissions. The deal was meant to prevent global average temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Technically, the US cannot leave the agreement until the day after the November 2020 election, when Trump will still be president regardless of the outcome. A Democrat president could rejoin the deal. Is Donald Trump making climate change worse with his rollbacks? The US is falling far short of its commitments to curb heat-trapping pollution, in part because Trump has gutted efforts made by his predecessor, Barack Obama. The country is on track to cut emissions 13% to 16% below 2005 levels by 2020, according to the analysis firm Rhodium Group. That\u2019s short of the 17% reduction the US promised in the Copenhagen Accord. \u201cLooking ahead to 2025, the US is on track to achieve reductions anywhere from 12% to 19% below 2005 levels absent major policy changes\u2014a far cry from its Paris Agreement pledge to reduce emissions 26% to 28%,\u201d Rhodium Group explains. The US, however, represents 15% of world emissions. Is Donald Trump a climate change denier? What is his record? Before becoming president, Trump called climate change a Chinese hoax. In an interview with Piers Morgan, he deflected questions about how his policies promote continued climate-change causing emissions. He said the US has \u201cthe cleanest climates\u201d and \u201cChina, India, Russia, many other nations, they have not very good air, not very good water.\u201d Trump\u2019s White House has downplayed the dangers of the climate crisis, including disagreeing with a federal report showing it threatens the US economy. Many of the president\u2019s appointees have denied climate change, and government scientists say their work on the crisis has been silenced. It is, of course, worth keeping in mind today the specific demands that climate groups have for meaningful action. The Youth Climate Strike Coalition in the US, has issued a set of policy demands which includes: Transform our economy to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2030 and phase out all fossil fuel extraction through a just and equitable transition, creating millions of good jobs A halt to all leasing and permitting for fossil fuel extraction, processing and infrastructure projects immediately Respect of Indigenous Land and Sovereignty and Environmental Justice Protection and restoration of 50% of the world\u2019s lands and oceans including a halt to all deforestation by 2030 Investment in farmers and regenerative agriculture and an end to subsidies for industrial agriculture Downtown New York City is packed with sign-bearing people of all ages, though the crowd noticeably skews young. Students from all over NYC have come to the march. Many young children are accompanied by their parents while middle and high school students are here with their friends. Almost all groups have posters in hand. On the way down to the march, I caught up with students from Professional Performing Arts School, who caught the subway to attend the strike together. They met up at school and decided to go to the march in a group. \u201cI just want the world to exist the way I knew it was growing up,\u201d said Nyla Robothan, a 15-year-old student at the school, on why she\u2019s striking. Many say this isn\u2019t their first march, having participating in other climate marches or the March For Our Lives protest in 2018. They say that they feel like their future feels uncertain because of the climate crisis, yet no one is listening to their generation. \u201cOur planet is dying, and no one\u2019s going to be doing anything except for us right now,\u201d said Arlene Guevara, 17, a student at Beacon High School in Manhattan. The march is slowly making its way down to Battery Park at the southern tip of Manhattan, where speakers, including Greta Thunberg, are slated to speak in the afternoon. We are expecting hundreds of Amazon workers to strike later in their HQ city of Seattle, Washington. Levi Pulkkinen is there to report on this for us and ahead of the strikes there, sent us this explainer of how some of the giant firm\u2019s workers are taking action and Thursday\u2019s move by Jeff Bezos pledging to improve Amazon\u2019s environmental impact: After months agitating for climate accountability from their employer, Amazon.com workers celebrated Thursday as the Seattle-based retail and cloud computing giant pledged to zero out carbon emissions by 2040. The announcement from CEO Jeff Bezos came as about 1,500 Amazon workers prepared to walkout Friday as part of the global strike for climate change. The disruption would mark the first time white-collar Amazon workers have walked off the job. Asserting that Bezos\u2019 pledge \u201cproves that collective action and employee pressure works,\u201d organizers of the stoppage reiterated demands that Amazon Web Services stop doing business with fossil fuel companies, and that the company cut ties with lobbyists, politicians and researchers hostile to climate science. Those calls were left unaddressed by the company, which did announce plans to acquire 100,000 electric delivery vans manufactured by an Amazon-funded company and an $100m commitment to an environmental restoration fund managed by The Nature Conservancy. In a statement, Bezos described the initiatives as evidencing a shift within Amazon. \u201cWe\u2019re done being in the middle of the herd on this issue \u2014 we\u2019ve decided to use our size and scale to make a difference,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cIf a company with as much physical infrastructure as Amazon \u2014 which delivers more than 10 billion items a year \u2014 can meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early, then any company can.\u201d Amazon, making good on a promise offered earlier in the year, also for the first time released an accounting of its carbon footprint. The assessment, audited by Paris-based certification agency Bureau Veritas, showed Amazon\u2019s direct and indirect CO2 emissions amounted to 44.4 million metric tons in 2018, a year that saw 37.1 billion metric tons of the greenhouse gas released globally. The Guardian\u2019s Latin American correspondent Tom Phillips has spotted a striking banner in Guadalajara, Mexico. Here\u2019s some footage from climate strikes around the world today: Miami student Greta Rodriguez feels exactly the same way as the famous teenage climate activist who shares her first name, and had a similar message as she joined dozens of classmates to protest in Miami Beach: We\u2019ve just had enough. The 15-year-old was among a party of 50 students from the Cushman private school in Key Biscayne who wanted to make their voices heard in this low-lying coastal city that is recognized as ground zero for sea level rise. \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough of big business and their trash, burning fossil fuels, depleting the earth,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has to change.\u201d Chaperoned by biology teacher Jen Russell, the Cushman kids were among the loudest at the Miami Beach strike. \u201cThey wanted to be here and the student government association organized the whole thing,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIt was important to them. We can talk to them as adults but it\u2019s the children who have the voice, it\u2019s their future.\u201d The Miami Beach strike drew hundreds of students from schools, colleges and universities across South Florida. A similar, simultaneous event outside the Broward school district headquarters in Fort Lauderdale attracted another large crowd. While private schools such as Cushman turned up with numbers, local public school leaders proved less amenable to students walking out of classes, however. Elijah Ruby, 17, a senior at South Broward high school, was banned from his prom for handing out flyers for the Fort Lauderdale event, according to the Miami Herald, and both the Broward and Miami-Dade school districts announced that absences for the strike would be recorded as unexcused. At the New York event are Zariah, age seven, and Lori Sapphire, who says: \u201cWe\u2019re here to save the planet. So no packaging. It\u2019s an easy solution. Focus on solar energy. No more cars burning oil. Stop taking every mineral from the earth. Go back to the simple ways. \u201cThere\u2019s enough for everyone. Stop burning the forests because we want to eat meat and soybeans. Use hemp for everything. It almost a joke that everything were doing is being so selfishly and unconsciously. It like we\u2019re not from the planet, otherwise we\u2019d care.\u201d The crowds in New York are massive but everyone is slowly making their way down to Battery Park. Earlier at the breakfast meeting for indigenous people from the Amazon and Indonesia, 19 year old Artemisa Barbosa Ribeiro, a climate activist known as Artemisa Xakriab\u00e1, told the Guardian she is thankful for all the young people who are joining the movement. \u201c I can see a future where we can make a difference but for that we must be listened to and respected,\u201d she said, describing how her people, the Xakriab\u00e1 peoples, a group of approximately 12 thousand people who live on the left bank of the S\u00e3o Francisco River, in the municipality of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o das Miss\u00f5es, in the state of Minas Gerais, have watched as mining companies have denied them access to the river and its water. \u201cThe scarcity of water in the territory is noticeable\u201d she says. \u201c We need the river and the water for our living and for our spiritual health, our connection to the earth. So access to the river is a big issue for us.\u201d Ribeiro, who was recently in Washington DC to demand action from members of the US congress alongside Greta Thunberg, said she felt that Jaire Bolsnaro\u2019s government have a plan for all indigenous people. \u201cI believe they want to assassinate us,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cIt\u2019s got much worse in the last eight months. We need support from outside the country because from the inside we have no support. \u201cThe main thing you can do in the west to help is to stop importing hard wood because that is causing deforestation and exploitation. That is the best way you can help,\u201d Ribeiro added. Here is a message from Greta Thunberg, who will be making a speech at the New York event later in Battery Park: There are many, many hundreds of protesters in DC. Blocks and blocks of a roughly 6-lane street filled and more coming and marching toward the US Capitol. I can\u2019t see the end. This gives you a sense of how big the gathering in New York is - so many people want to participate. Delaney Reynolds has addressed the general assembly of the United Nations on the climate crisis. She has appeared in a prime time National Geographic special, written books, won awards, launched a non-profit battling sea rise, shared a stage with Al Gore and changed laws in almost a decade as an environmental activist and entrepreneur. She is also still only 20. \u201cThe youth voice is extremely powerful,\u201d says Reynolds, a speaker at this morning\u2019s youth climate strike in Miami Beach. \u201cI hope our elected leaders realise that current young voters and soon-to-be voters care passionately about this issue and very much want to see something done about it.\u201d Reynolds is not afraid to play hardball to tackle the climate emergency. She is the lead plaintiff of eight young Floridians currently suing their state and its governor for \u201cviolating their fundamental rights to a stable climate system\u201d through their reliance on fossil fuels. But she knows collaboration can work just as well as confrontation. As a teenager she was instrumental in getting the city of South Miami to adopt Florida\u2019s first law requiring solar panels on newly-built homes. \u201cWe also spoke at a Miami-Dade budget hearing and the same day after hearing the children speak the county created the post of chief resilience officer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe young generation is starting to realise our voice matters. Our leaders are going to have to pay attention if a bunch of kids stop going to school and start standing on their steps at city hall. They may not have a vote but they do have a voice.\u201d The climate strike is being held the same day as the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico and left nearly 3,000 people dead. In recognition of that event, the climate strike is happening in concert with a Puerto Rico Day of Action to highlight the struggles the island still faces in its effort to rebuild, while remaining vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Marisol Rivera, a 13-year-old Puerto Rican student in Brooklyn, has been speaking on Friday about Maria and how it impacted her family, She will connect the issues there to the climate crisis. Other Puerto Rican activists will also speak at the event, including Gustavo Rivera, a New York state senator (he is unrelated to Marisol). Puerto Rico is still recovering from the hurricane, which affected all of the 3.5 million Americans who lived on the island. Its power grid was knocked out completely by the storm and families reported having no electricity nearly a year after the hurricane. Here are some photographs of people gathering in New York\u2019s Foley Square. Donald Trump is set to attend the United Nations headquarters during Monday\u2019s key summit on the climate crisis \u2013 but will be there to take part in a meeting on religious freedom instead. A senior UN official confirmed to the Guardian that the White House has booked one of the large conference rooms in the New York headquarters on Monday so that the president can address a gathering on religious freedom. The move is likely to be seen as a blatant snub to the UN climate summit, to be held in the same building on the same day. Leaders from around the world, including the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson; France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron; and India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, are expected at the summit as part of a major UN push to heighten the response to the escalating climate crisis. UN sources said the booking of the room was relatively last minute and will cause some logistical issues given the major security operation that accompanies the US president wherever he goes. But a senior UN official said they were \u201cnot panicked\u201d given the large organizational capacity of the UN general assembly. \u201cNo one was really expecting the president to come to the climate summit,\u201d the official said. It\u2019s understood that senior UN staff have realistic expectations of Trump and do not expect him to engage on the climate crisis, even for a summit held in his hometown. Trump has vowed the US will withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement. Many folks have come to New York from all over the world to attend today\u2019s strike, planning their trips months in advance. Our Village, a coalition made of indigenous groups and communities of color, spoke to reporters this morning, in a studio space in New York City where they were making signs and distributing T-shirts in anticipation of the march. Dinaman Tux\u00e1, traveled from Bahia, Brazil with a delegation of six Brazillians from all over the country to speak out against the injustices against indigenous communities in Brazil. \u201cWe\u2019re going through a process of genoicde. \u2026 President Bolsonaro, he\u2019s spreading hate against the indigenous populations of Brazil,\u201d Tux\u00e1 said through a translator. \u201cUs, the indigenous people, we are the guardians of the forest. \u2026 We need the world to recognize our contributions and help us protect our territories.\u201d Tux\u00e1 said that he traveled to New York because Brazillians aren\u2019t listening to the cry of indigenous communities in their country, so they\u2019re making an international cry in anticipation of the UN climate summit. The United Nations headquarters in New York will play host tonight to an immersive art installation by artist Joseph Michael that features images of an iceberg and six young advocates, including Greta Thunberg, addressing hopes and fears around the climate crisis. We have some pictures from last night\u2019s final rehearsal: We will be live through the rest of the day here in the US with Oliver Milman, Lauren Aratani and Ed Helmore reporting on the big rally in New York city. Emily Holden, meanwhile, is out with activists in Washington DC while Richard Luscombe is at the strikes in Miami Beach. Later on, Levi Pulkkinen in Seattle will be with more than 1,500 corporate Amazon workers expected to strike to highlight criticisms of the company\u2019s climate policies. CEO Jeff Bozos said on Thursday that Amazon would do more and pledged the firm would be carbon neutral by 2040. Susie Cagle, meanwhile, will be reporting on the strikes from the city of Richmond, California, and we\u2019ll also have a dispatch from Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro. All week, the Guardian has been part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate emergency. Welcome from the Guardian\u2019s office in New York, where we are now anchoring live coverage of these calls for climate action, which have drawn huge crowds around the world. We expect the US will be staging its largest ever climate strike, with actions planned in more than 1,000 locations, including major rallies in New York, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. Here at the Guardian\u2019s New York office, members of our team in midtown Manhattan walked out at midday local time to participate in the strike. Further downtown, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg will be leading a big strike rally which she is expected to speak at later in the day, ahead of addressing the UN\u2019s Climate Action Summit next week. Activists are gathering in Foley Square, near City Hall, and will start marching south on Broadway at 1pm ET to rally in Battery park. There have already been significant protests across the world today with millions joining the climate strike to urge politicians and businesses to take action to avert the climate crisis. With parts of the US just waking up and others still asleep it\u2019s far from over so I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Mark Oliver, who is taking over the blog and will keep you abreast of all the latest developments in the US and elsewhere. Back in the UK, the police monitoring group Netpol says that officers are restricting protesters in London by kettling them (for those unfamiliar with the British vernacular it means confining demonstrators in a small area) on the southside of Westminster Bridge. New York is standing up! The Rolling Stones legend Keith Richards has endorsed the climate strike, realising that Time is not actually On Our Side (sorry). The Guardian has partnered with Friends of the Earth to highlight the climate crisis and raise funds for the charity, which is doing so much to address the damage that has been done and continues to be done to the planet. Here is a country I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve featured on the blog so far today. With the US protests beginning, it feels like a good time to highlight this article on the huge impact climate change could have on the nation if it is not arrested. The US is waking up (in more ways than one) and already there are sizeable crowds reported. Here is a useful reminder about the impact of flying. You can also calculate the impact of your next trip. Anuna De Wever, 18, a cofounder of Belgium\u2019s school strike movement, which has organised 20 nationwide strike days since January, said today\u2019s protest in Brussels made her feel hopeful. It was amazing, we had 20,000 across the streets. I am really happy about this strike because I feel like after coming on the streets after 20 weeks, this is our season two. There are so many people ready and it just makes me feel very hopeful. But she added: Belgium is doing really badly on the climate crisis. There is not any ambition from any of our politicians. So we are really asking them to take responsibility because right now we don\u2019t have a climate policy and they really need to take responsibility. While Belgium has signed the Paris Agreement, the three Belgian regions (Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia) have so far been unable to agree on the distribution of emissions cuts. De Wever thinks the school strike movement is helping to bridge these old political divides. There are some arguments, especially in politics but we don\u2019t care about that and we want to unite everyone to fight with us. I think it\u2019s beautiful that no one is thinking about this, are they from the Walloon side or are they from the Flemish side. The Brussels protest finished close to the headquarters of the European commission and European council - not an accidental choice as the EU debates decarbonising its economy by 2050. Earlier in the day, De Wever and other activists met the European commission vice president, Frans Timmermans, who has been tasked with drawing up a Green New Deal to allow the EU to move away from fossil fuel and meet its climate pledges. The bulk of those still taking part in the climate strike in London reached the entrance to Trafalgar Square a little earlier, where police blocked it off at Northumberland Avenue, to chants of \u201clet them through\u201d. Many people are on their way home now. I was speaking at the back of the crowd to two new mothers, Chloe Reeves and Lauren Slattery, who had brought along their children, Leo (five months) and Phoenix (seven months). While deeply concerned about the climate crisis \u2013 to the extent that they have discussed jointly purchasing land on higher ground for children as a reaction to rising sea levels - they\u2019ve been drawing some encouragement from the international focus of the strikes. \u201cTo be honest as a new mother I\u2019ve been putting all my energy into the basic job of keeping baby alive and looking after him and I\u2019ve purposefully not thought about climate change because it has freaked me out so much, but now my mother instincts have allowed me to shift a bit of emphasis on to things like this and the action that we need to take,\u201d said Chloe. Lauren added: \u201cActions like today have really been inspiring. We recycle and do as much as we can in our personal daily lives but you really realise that so much more needs to done, and we really are on a tight schedule.\u201d Nearly two-thirds (64%) of Generation Z Americans want to work for employers committed to tackling climate change, according to research released today from international non-profit organisation the Climate Group. It surveyed more than 1,000 16- to 24-year-olds across the US to find out their views on climate change and how it will affect their future choices. Three in four young people (77%) feel climate change is an important issue that needs to be solved, with almost identical results for Democratic and Republican states (80% v 76%). With the US federal government actively rolling back pro-climate policies, for most young people the bulk of responsibility to solve the climate crisis rests on the shoulders of big US businesses and state governments alike (60% for big businesses v 69% for state governments). Four out of five (80%) support US companies adopting renewable energy in place of fossil fuels, with two in five (40%) believing they should be using 100% clean energy already. Two-fifths think the switch needs to be made by 2030 at the latest. Within the transport sector, two-thirds (66%) of young people would support the replacement of short-haul flights with cleaner alternatives, such as high-speed rail. Helen Clarkson, CEO of the Climate Group, which annually hosts Climate Week NYC, said: We need wholescale changes to economies and infrastructure to make pro-climate choices the new normal. It is in the interests of every business and government to sit up and listen to the next generation of workers and voters. We know through our initiatives for business on renewables, electric vehicles, and smart efficient energy and work with state and regional governments that good progress is being made in the US, but more needs to be done at a greater pace and scale. Demonstrations, marches, even open-air classes on environmental policy are planned in more than 40 Brazilian cities on Friday. And while numbers are likely to range widely \u2013 from 186 people who signed up for the Facebook event of a protest at 5pm in the southern city of Florian\u00f3polis to 12,000 promising to attend another at 4pm on S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s landmark Paulista Avenue, activists said the geographical spread of cities taking part shows how non-party, environmental activism is growing here. \u201cWe are talking to churches, unions, social movements,\u201d said Yumi Kawamura, 45, a sociologist helping organise the S\u00e3o Paulo event, \u201clooking to unite organisations with different agendas and find a common way forward.\u201d In Rio de Janeiro, a protest at 10am outside the state legislature is aimed at children and young people. Another is scheduled for 2.30pm. Then at 4pm demonstrators hold an open-air class outside the headquarters of beleaguered environment agency Ibama - under attack from far-right president Jair Bolsonaro and his business-friendly environment minister, Ricardo Salles \u2013 before marching to the city centre. Events are being staged by the Rio Climate Coalition (Coaliz\u00e3o Pelo Clima Rio), an umbrella group of collectives. \u201cIt is very plural, it is horizontal, it is collective. It is aligned with the movement that Greta (Thunberg) started in Europe,\u201d said Hanna Cordeiro, 31, an advertising executive and climate activist from the coalition. Brazil is one of the world\u2019s deadliest countries for environmental defenders \u2013 one reason, Cordeiro said, why environmental demonstrations in Brazil are usually smaller here. Another is that pressing problems with poverty, crime, unemployment and a lack of basic sanitation obscure environmental issues for many Brazilians. \u201cIn Brazil it is jobs and housing. The environmental agenda is seen as more subjective. In Europe it is much stronger,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Oeiras, 57, a climate organiser for the leftist Workers\u2019 party helping stage a demonstration at 4pm in the Amazon city of Bel\u00e9m. When the Amazon fires crisis exploded, Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters flooded social media and WhatsApp with fake news \u2013 a report by the Publica journalism agency showed how automated Twitter accounts led attacks. The propaganda deluge echoed Bolsonaro\u2019s unproven arguments that the blazes were started by foreign NGOs and foreign interest constituted an attack on Brazilian sovereignty. Such nationalist rhetoric has long resounded in the Amazon. \u201cThis is an old argument,\u201d Oeiras said. \u201cIt\u2019s a contradiction we need to overcome.\u201d Fatima Zara Alarakha, 20, a campaigner for Islamic Relief UK and an arts student, marching on Millbank beside the Houses of Parliament in central London, said fighting climate change was imperative, given her beliefs: I\u2019m here today because it is my duty as Muslim and a human. Allah entrusted us to look after the earth and it is our responsibility to do so. I\u2019m striking today to represent my family in Pakistan whose houses are being flooded as a result of our overconsumption in the west. I\u2019m also here to represent the future generations whose lives will be affected by the decisions we make. I want to bring children up in a world where they don\u2019t have to suffer from majorly polluted air, decrepit housing and the health problems and poverty brought on by the climate crisis. Manisha Jeevan, 16, isn\u2019t sure she is ready for her music exam tomorrow. But she decided to skip school because climate change is more important, she says. \u201cIf there is no earth then how will we live?\u201d She is protesting near Lodhi gardens, Delhi, with her friend, Kushi, also 16. They worry about pollution in Delhi, about the failure to manage waste properly and about the increasingly hot weather. \u201cIt\u2019s September. Our parents used to get winter in this month but we have not got winter. We are losing our seasons,\u201d says Kushi. Rishika Singh, 18, a college student, worries about the damage that Delhi\u2019s pollution is doing to her lungs. She says: I even bought a mask, but it\u2019s not so easy to wear every day. The pollution that we see here, and the water here which has a lot of chlorine in it - it\u2019s not good. It\u2019s the poorest who suffer the most.The rich are better off - they make the use of air conditioning and private cars for comfort. It\u2019s evening now in Delhi and, after an afternoon of chanting and banging drums, protesters have gone home. Nimrat Singh, 21, a law student, says people want action, not words, from their leaders. \u201cWe want the system to actually recognise climate change,\u201d she says. New York City is anticipated to see one of the largest climate strikes today. Thousands of people are expected at the protest, which is being co-hosted by over two dozen local and national groups. Protesters plan to gather at a park outside New York\u2019s City Hall and march a mile down to Battery Park, where Greta Thunberg is scheduled to speak in the afternoon along with other performers and speakers. In anticipation of the strikes, NYC\u2019s Department of Education announced the absences of students in the district, the largest school district in the nation, will be excused on Friday with parental permission. In other words, 1.1 million students have been given the green light to attend the strikes if they want to. Many students have spent the last few weeks painting signs and banners in preparation. Before the march\u2019s official start at noon local time (5pm BST), a rally honoring the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria will take place in downtown Manhattan. The central London rally, outside parliament, has heard speeches from Jeremy Corbyn and Caroline Lucas, with the Labour leader calling for tougher global environmental standards to prevent the import of products made overseas using harmful processes. From an open-top double-decker bus being used a stage, Corbyn told the crowd: So when we measure the effects of climate change emissions, let\u2019s measure those emissions at the source, where they are created, and not put ourselves in some comfort zone, that we\u2019re doing OK at the expense of somebody else. Corbyn also called for what Labour term a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d \u2013 a version of the green new deal \u2013 to invest heavily in areas such as sustainable energy. That green industrial revolution can bring about, I believe, 400,000 decent, high-quality jobs. And with that we also have cleaner air, we have better quality of life, and we deal with many of the health inequalities that exist in this country. Beforehand, Lucas began by noting that in May parliament had passed a motion declaring a climate emergency. \u201cSo don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you that you are not making a difference,\u201d the Green MP told the crowd. \u201cYou are making history.\u201d Calling it \u201cthe biggest social justice issue of our time\u201d, Lucas said the government needed to make more urgent plans than the commitment of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. She said: The truth is that a climate target of net zero by 2050 is not climate leadership. When your house is on fire you don\u2019t call 999 and ask for a fire engine in 30 years\u2019 time. You want urgent action now. This is a striking picture, no pun intended, from Berlin. The translation of the sign held by \u201cMerkel\u201d reads: \u201cMother (Merkel) has failed, now it\u2019s the turn of young people.\u201d The Bishop of Wolverhampton, Clive Gregory, has asked all clergy members and lay employees within the Dioceses of Lichfield to set aside their usual duties today to focus instead on Climate Action activities. Gregory led a special service at Lichfield Cathedral to raise awareness about the climate crisis. Around 550 pupils and teachers from five West Midlands primary schools attended. Children from St Michael\u2019s CE primary school in Lichfield arrived holding handmade signs and chanting \u201csave our world\u201d. My colleague, Ben Quinn, is in Westminster where climate strikers are heading towards Downing Street, but there is also a counter-demonstration by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s brother, and famed climate change denier, Piers. The German government today announced a new climate protection package costing \u20ac50bn, which was immediately criticised as lacking ambition by Fridays for Future protesters. At a press conference in central Berlin, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that as a scientist she had been impressed by Greta Thunberg\u2019s motto \u201cunite behind the science\u201d. Following a marathon negotiation session, Merkel\u2019s conservatives and her Social Democrat coalition partner detailed plans for increased purchase premiers for electric cars, and new taxes for traditional cars with emissions over 115mg. The measures include a ban on installing oil-fired heating in buildings from 2025, with a subsidy for householders prepared to switch to more climate-friendly alternatives. A price for emissions of carbon dioxide has also been agreed that will take effect via trading in emissions certificates. The package also includes new investment in rail networks, and promises of reduced fares. In a tweet, Fridays for Future criticised the plans: Dear government: if you spend years doing nothing for climate protection and then, after months of massive public pressure, discuss measures that have nothing to do with [the plan to halt global warming at] 1.5C, then that\u2019s not a \u2018breakthrough\u2019 but a scandal. You can see some of the best pictures of the day here: Thanks for the excellent questions, which have ranged from science and politics to a plea from a deskbound worker \u2013 hang in there! \u2013 and thanks to you all for taking part in the debate over climate issues and solutions. Today\u2019s climate strikes have sent a message round the world that will be heard in the highest echelons of politics and business, but which have also helped to spur public engagement with the solutions to the crisis that will be needed if we are to make the vast changes we must to avoid the worst ravages of climate chaos. On a personal note, today is almost exactly 15 years since I started writing full-time about the climate crisis, and related environmental issues, and although progress in that time has been grindingly slow in many ways, it has also been marked by sudden leaps forward. Improving public understanding and engagement is at the heart of making a better future. The messages from today are clear. This is not somebody else\u2019s problem: it is ours. This is not a problem for the future: it is now. This is not an inevitable catastrophe: we can still make things much better. A noisy and good natured protest is being held in Bedford, with a few hundred protesters, including one dressed as a giant dinosaur, marching along the High Street at lunchtime shouting \u201cwhat do we want, climate justice\u201d, \u201cno planet B\u201d and \u201cthis is what democracy looks like\u201d. The protest is being led by children from local schools, clearly drawing their inspiration from climate activist Greta Thunberg. Earlier, Bedford\u2019s MP, Mohammad Yasin, addressed the crowd, saying he was sorry that politicians had let people down and pledging his support. One young protester addressing the crowd said: \u201cWe may only be 14 or 15 years old but we\u2019re a force to be reckoned with.\u201d Later, a die-in was held in Harpur Square in Bedford town centre. Indy Willaert, Liza, Fran Demeyer and Jana Bameils, all aged 13, have taken half a day off school to attend the climate march in Brussels. Not all their teachers are in favour. \u201cSome of them are alright with it, but some of them would rather have us in class,\u201d says Fran, who has already taken part in several school strikes. \u201cThat climate is more important ... You can always do [your work] after school,\u201d adds Indy. Liza wants politicians to help make green choices easier, including reducing plastic waste. \u201cWe can only buy plastic because everything is in plastic. We want them to help us\u201d They all agree with Jana that politicians are not doing enough. The four schoolgirls arrived from their home city of Ghent to join the climate march in Brussels, which started from the city\u2019s North Station and will finish around the headquarters of the European Union. Along the route there was music, drum beating and chanting. Young people jumped up and down to the slogan: \u201cPlus chaud, plus chaud, plus chaud que le climat\u201d (Hotter, hotter, hotter than the climate). Stijn, a 28-year-old engineer, was missing work to join the protest. His employers \u201cwere not very happy about it but they couldn\u2019t really make a fuss about it either,\u201d he said. \u201cLike the other side of my sign says there are no jobs on a dead planet so it is important to be here today.\u201d His friend, Deniz Malat, 27, a recent plant biology graduate, feels people are being ignored by the government. \u201cWe want change and we are being ignored by the government - the politicians. We want to come together to show we are serious and they should consider what we are saying here.\u201d People are also out in force in Poland. Ten-year-old Nellie Jacobs and her mother, Helen, had never protested before their hometown of Whaley Bridge made national headlines earlier this month. Nellie and her Dad were choosing books in the library of their quiet Derbyshire town when Helen called them in a panic to say its dam had burst and the whole neighbourhood could go under. Carrying a homemade placard saying \u201cSchool strike for climate\u201d, Nellie was allowed to take the day off school at Whaley Bridge primary to join the global strike in Manchester. She said: Everyone had to be evacuated and we raced for high ground. I was quite scared because we weren\u2019t expecting it. We occasionally get police cars coming through Whaley for something that\u2019s not in Whaley but we\u2019ve not had crises in Whaley. I\u2019m worried it might happen again. We weren\u2019t used to that much rain so it made me worry and it made me think all this rain, we don\u2019t get it usually so I thought that it was climate change that caused the rain. Her mother Helen Jacobs said she had never protested in her life but felt infuriated by the inaction of global leaders. She said: It\u2019s kind of getting the politicians to realise that they\u2019ve made a mistake in saying that it\u2019s really nothing when it\u2019s a really big problem and we need to act on it now. I thought if I got out here and did something then it might happen. It\u2019s been building up a lot in my mind. The climate is under threat and it has been for a long time but the action doesn\u2019t seem to have fit the imperative. We feel like we need to wake the government up, we need to wake world leaders up and make them realise that we need systematic massive change. We\u2019re here and ready for change to bring the temperature down. We feel like we need to shake them by the collar to make them realise. The scientists are there telling them and still President Trump is denying climate change exists! Other leaders need to grab him, shake him, and get him on board. The whole world needs to get on this. In Aviemore, a town in the Cairngorms National Park, in the Scottish Highlands, strikes are taking place. We were sent another photograph of activity there today from Iain Gibson. Nick from Norwich asked: How can I join in the strike in a non-unionised office where no one cares about climate change without getting the sack? That is a tough one. Most companies will be affected by climate chaos in some way, however: extreme weather events are already costing billions a year and those costs are not coming down soon. Foresighted companies will audit the risks they face and act to deal with them. If you work for a publicly listed company, you could try buying some shares and turning up at the AGM to ask questions about how they are dealing with climate risk. If you don\u2019t, more of your co-workers may be interested in the climate than you think: polls show a great majority of people in most countries are concerned about the climate crisis. Dan from Tunbridge Wells asked: How will we make our nuclear power plants safe if this civilisation collapses? How does the hydrological cycle fit in? Can regenerative agriculture help? Regenerative agriculture can help, and sustainable agriculture can reduce emissions, aid carbon storage and feed the world more healthily, as recent reports by the Lancet and WRI, among others, have shown. As for hydrology, the effects of climate chaos are likely to be the wet areas of the world getting wetter and the dry areas getting drier, which is problematic. And as for nuclear power, some people - including the Guardian\u2019s George Monbiot - see it as an uncomfortable but perhaps necessary way out of the climate crisis, but the very long-term storage of nuclear waste is a problem still to be solved. Kee from London asked: How much impact do long-haul flights have? How does the impact compare with, say, driving a car, or using electrical household appliances every day? My colleague Niko Kommenda recently published an excellent calculator showing what impact flights have. Whether you can offset the emissions from such flights by cutting carbon in other aspects depends on how many flights you take and where to. Niko from Germany asked: What is your estimate on how much renewables capacity Europe needs to build to meet its climate targets? My rough guess is between 30-40 GW per year, that would equal about 600 wind turbines per month, that\u2019s quite a challenge (other forms of renewables are of course available). The International Energy Agency and the European Environment Agency are the best sources. Stephen from Cheshire asked: Whatever happened to the plant a tree in \u201873 campaigns I grew up with in the 1970s? Surely now is a good time to kickstart this again with planting in every public space and private garden. Fruit trees also feed us and wildlife. I have planted hundreds of trees over the years. Ultimately, however, the planet is simply overcrowded. My wife and I chose to be child free so we\u2019ve done our bit... I love the plant a tree in 73 campaign as I used to have some of the stickers! Planting trees is part of the UK government response but so far targets have been missed. Today my colleague Rowena Mason reports on an NHS tree planting campaign. Thousands of French youngsters skipped school to march through Paris. Claude Guyon, a cinema decorator and sculptor, was dressed as a Brazilian tribal leader and carried a \u201csacred rattle\u201d. He said: I\u2019m here to represent the guardians of the Earth from north and South America. The tribal leader, who is a woman, gave me this headdress so I could be here today as an ambassador for her. Primary school headteacher Scott McFarlane took the morning off work to attend the Middlesborough climate strike with his wife, who is also a teacher, and his nine-year-old son, who is a pupil at his school. During the strike, dozens of protesters staged a \u201cdie in\u201d in the North Yorkshire town\u2019s Centre Square \u2013 lying on the pavement for seven minutes to illustrate the rate at which it is believed species are becoming extinct. McFarlane allowed other children at Stokesley primary academy to take part in the strikes if they wished, giving them an \u201ceducation other than at school\u201d mark on the register. While not many took up the offer, he said the fact that so many young people seemed to be engaged with environmental activism had given him hope. \u201cI think Greta Thunberg\u2019s an absolute idol. We\u2019ve got kids at school who last year were coming dressed as Ariana Grande, but have now changed their hairstyles to look like Greta,\u201d said McFarlane. McFarlane, who is a member of Extinction Rebellion Teesside, said he and his son would be striking from the school next month for XR\u2019s October Rebellion in London. \u201cI am genuinely scared for the future of the human race. Not in the distant future but soon. We have to act,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any further action like today, I will always let children have the day off. Not everybody agrees and I\u2019m not asking them to, really. But I hope our example is one that people are starting to take on board.\u201d Of all the venues globally that will host climate strike protests today, none can surpass Miami Beach for poignancy. Florida\u2019s poster-city for sea level rise will sink under seven feet of water by the end of the century, if scientists\u2019 predictions are realised, and already it takes only a high tide and a rainy day to send floodwaters surging inland. These dark clouds are why student climate activists from all over South Florida will gather at Miami Beach city hall this morning to reinforce their message that more needs to be done. At the most recent youth strike in May, barely four dozen waved placards and called for action - but today students will walk out of their South Florida schools and assemble there in their hundreds to highlight the urgency of the moment. Gabriella Marchesani, a Miami high school senior and an organiser of today\u2019s rally: We\u2019re told by the adults, \u2018what you\u2019re doing is a good thing, keep up the great work\u2019. But it shouldn\u2019t be just \u2018oh, keep doing what you\u2019re doing\u2019, it should be \u2018let me see what I can do to help you. How can I be a climate voter? How can I switch my lifestyle to be more sustainable? How can I lower my carbon footprint?\u2019 She adds: We want this to be that historic moment that we look back on and say that was the day we got it changed. That was the day we were able to make people hear us, and create legislation and address this crisis. Andreu from Valencia, Spain asked: According to scientists, the \u201cnatural evolution\u201d of the sun will lead to major climate change here on the Earth. So, what role, if any, does solar activity (solar winds, solar flares, sunspots) play in climate change right now? Are we missing something, have we miscalculated or does the sun have nothing to do with climate change at this point? Changes in the sun\u2019s activity are not causing the climate change and global heating we are currently experiencing. They are caused by human actions, chiefly burning fossil fuels and changing land use, as successive reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have conclusively shown. Alex from Warwickshire asked: The electrification of small vehicles is seen as an achievable near-term step towards cutting emissions, but to replace a significant fraction of the current fossil-fuelled fleet would presumably require a drastic increase in the global extraction and use of \u2018rare-earth\u2019 metals for battery manufacture. How well do we currently understand the environmental impact of such a change and are there more sustainable battery technologies on the horizon? In the long term, availability of rare earths will be an important issue but it is equally important to note that there are no serious current supply problems as the manufacturing rates show. Batteries are one of the biggest areas of research and there are multiple avenues being explored, from nanotechnology to graphene and even aluminium, a common metal, as an alternative. Hydrogen fuel cells are another possibility. Tracey from Ross-on-Wye asked: Guy McPherson, an environmental scientist, argues that, due to the protection from the sun\u2019s heat attributable to global dimming, if we cut carbon emissions the Earth will heat faster, and the planet will be uninhabitable for any species within a decade. Why is this theory not spoken about or even mentioned by any other leading environmental voices? Because it is wrong. The dimming of light from the sun owing to aerosols does have a small effect, but as you seem to be pointing out, many of the aerosols are soot, or black carbon. Black carbon actually adds to warming, especially when it falls on snow. Removing black carbon and other short-lived climate pollutants could reduce temperatures by as much as 0.5C as work by Durwood Zaelke and others has clearly shown. You can share your questions now via our form here, or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they\u2019ll be easier for us to find. Lyra Harris, six, from Islington, London, protesting outside 10 Downing Street, said: Stop this nonsense. Our Earth is getting too hot. We have to act now for everyone. It\u2019s not just for humans, climate change harms the animals too. Over in Greece it is pupils who have been leading protests with hundreds pouring into Athens\u2019 main plaza, Syntaga square. Ariadni, 15, holding a hand-drawn placard of a weeping planet under a halo of heat said: I am here to raise awareness. There\u2019s not much time left. This is global. People need to be informed and they need to act now. Maria Makarem, the 16-year-old who had helped organise the strike said the protesters had ended up in front of the parliament to ram home the message that urgent times call for urgent measures. \u201cThey have to understand, all the politicians in there, that we are the new generation and we want change,\u201d she said, her own placard proclaiming: \u201cOur world, our future, our choice.\u201d Yiannis Marangakis and Foivos Anastadiades, both aged 10 and both taken out of class by their mothers Daniella and Myrtia to attend the protest, had an even simpler message: \u201cThe earth is very important to us. We have to save it.\u201d This shows the scale of the march in Edinburgh: Ian Mantgani, 36, is striking in London today. He says: We have to put pressure on our employers, MPs and friends. We need a new power grid and electric cars on the road or we\u2019re toast. Keep pressuring those in power for concrete change and keep pressuring them when they give you mealy mouthed answers. I believe that\u2019s the best way forward for change.\u201d Chris from South Africa asked: Why are we not seeing a rise in sea levels? Could it perhaps partly be due to the fact that rainfall across the SAHEL region that is rapidly greening is 40m olympic swimming pools up on a few years ago? We are seeing a rise in sea levels. And sea levels alone are not the biggest problem: storm and tidal surges are much worse when sea levels are even slightly higher, with the power to overtop our sea defences. Desertification is increasing in many parts of Africa, with climate change one of the reasons but not the only one (overgrazing and land use changes also play a major role). Artur from Crewe asked: Are we prepared to do real things to tackle climate change? We can say do this or do that but our use of social media takes significant resources. The cheap food, cheap technology, new mobiles released every year is driven by customers not the other way around so how many are actually genuinely prepared to change their way of life? People are increasingly understanding that lifestyle changes are necessary, from veganism and flexitarian diets to changing our travel habits. Renewable energy such as wind and solar is already cheaper or on a par with fossil fuels in many areas, and its deployment is increasing fast. A Guardian reader from London who wanted to remain anonymous asked: How democratic is it that a secondary school threatens their pupils with being expelled if they participate in today\u2019s strike? How are we teaching \u2018British values\u2019 to our kids if in their school are not allowed to protest for something that fully impacts their future? What will it be next? Forbid them to participate in any human rights support act? Schools will make their own judgment, but engaging children with a subject of huge importance in scientific, political and historical terms might strike many teachers as a great opportunity. The climate emergency relates to chemistry, physics, biology, geography, history, social studies \u2013 you could probably even fit it into a load of other lessons too. Why not see this as an opportunity to engage pupils rather than turn them off? Derek from West Sussex asked: The UK has a good record of deploying offshore wind generation. What I don\u2019t understand is why we aren\u2019t deploying wave power and tidal power generation? We have the most coastline per head of any major European country. Wave power never stops, unlike wind, it is more energy dense than wind, and it could have other benefits like reducing coastal erosion. Tidal power solutions likewise are always available and energy dense. There is an ecological cost in habitats but a balance is needed here. Do we really think that the ecological cost of a tidal barrier is worse than a nuclear power station? There is an ecological cost to farmland too, but we need to eat, so we cut down all the forests we had in medieval times to make room for agriculture. We just need to make some room for power generation too. The UK is a world leader on offshore wind, as the latest green power auctions show. Wave and tidal power have proved more difficult, in the latter case partly owing to the changes that would be required to landscape a tidal lagoon. But as public subsidy is less needed for wind and solar as prices have come down, it might become possible to spend more of it on wave and tidal power \u2013 they may prove cheaper than the high costs agreed to by the government for nuclear energy. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, received a warm applause at the city\u2019s climate protest when he gave a speech pledging that \u201cfracking is the past, it is not the future\u201d \u2013 but by far the biggest cheers went to a 10-year-old girl called Lillia who took to the stage next. The local schoolgirl, with a high-pitched Mancunian accent and fluorescent ear-defenders tied to her backpack, gave a rousing speech taking aim at politicians for their \u201clies\u201d \u2013 before turning directly to Burnham. Lies, when you don\u2019t count the airport in the emission figures! Lies, when we have 1,200 air pollution related deaths in Manchester just last year \u2013 but they plan to build a huge car park right next door to a school in Ancoats. Lies when the pension funds of Manchester are still investing \u00a31.4bn in fossil fuel companies \u2026 Lies, in April the mayor Andy Burnham, when I asked if he would support us. I asked for more than publicity stunt pictures. Where\u2019s the action? To huge cheers, she continued: Today I woke up to the images around the world of a million people striking and my heart lifted because I knew we weren\u2019t alone in our fight. Thank you for coming out to support us. Thank you for having the courage to fight for our future! To adults I say, you have the power to vote you need to keep amplifying our voices. We the youth cannot wait until we are old enough - we need action now. Numbers at Berlin\u2018s Klimastreik have reached 100,000, it has just been announced. Carola Rackete, the SeaWatch Captain who was arrested in Italy several weeks ago addressed Berlin\u2019s Klimastreik, to huge applause. She told them: We adults are responsible for the fact that the Earth is dying ... we should not be under the illusion that our individual actions can ... turn the situation around. She paid tribute to \u201cthe children and young people who have campaigned tirelessly for over a year ... and managed to get this issue to the top of the political agenda\u201d. She said temperatures could be expected to rise by 4-6C by the end of the century. Extinction Rebellion, to which she belongs, was telling the truth when it predicted the collapse of human civilisation as a result. We can no longer stop global heating, she said, \u201cit\u2019s too late\u201d, but we can \u201creduce greenhouse gases with immediate effect\u201d. Sarah from Cardiff asked: What are the advantages people will see and experience through the changes we need to make due to climate change? For example, I believe cycling rather than driving will make people healthier, shopping locally rather than online increases daily interactions. Do you envisage the activists and media managing to put this side of the crisis across? Cleaning up greenhouse gases has myriad beneficial side effects, including cleaner air as diesel and petrol cars are taken off the roads in favour of electric vehicles, public transport and walking or cycling. Our knowledge of the harms of air pollution has expanded dramatically in the past few years: we now know air pollutants can be found in all human organs, and it is linked not only to respiratory problems and heart disease but also dementia, developmental problems and miscarriage. In some ways, the cleaning up of air pollution is easier to explain than climate chaos because people can see and feel air pollution more clearly than the link between invisible carbon dioxide and extreme weather, and increasingly air pollution campaigners are making the link with climate benefits from moving away from coal and diesel in particular. Louis from London asked: Today is wonderful to see - the energy and passion - but how can you be sure we haven\u2019t left it too late ? There is a climate doomosphere - I\u2019m thinking Paul Beckwith, Peter Wadhams and others who suggest overwhelming events in the next decade or two. Can they be dismissed as fringe cranks? Climate change is a problem for today, not the distant future, and the effects are already being seen, as we have extensively reported. But there is still time to stave off the worst effects if we take action on emissions now. The IPCC has said emissions must be effectively zero by around mid-century to hold the world to no more than 1.5C of warning, and every effort to bring down emissions helps towards that goal. But there are scary things we know less about: tipping points, which could cause runaway heating to take hold. These include Arctic sea ice melt, which reveals dark sea instead of reflective ice, creating more warming, and the melting permafrost that releases methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, in a vicious circle. Some have suggested we turn our efforts to adapting to climate change instead of cutting emissions. But adapting without cutting emissions is like trying to mop up an overflowing sink with the taps still running. The truth is we need to do both, and urgently.

Just to stand back from the breathless enthusiasm of the protests for a moment, our environment editor, Damian Carrington, has been pulling out a series of charts that highlight the scale of the challenge - and the beginnings of some solutions. Perhaps the most important one is this: the planet\u2019s average temperature started a steady climb two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. We have also tried to capture this alarming rise in temperatures in a startling piece of music. Alas, it is not a banger, so is unlikely to become a global anthem for the Friday strikes movement. But it\u2019s not all gloom and doom. The three charts below show the progress we have made, in renewable energy generation, electric vehicle production, and battery development. Today\u2019s climate strikes highlight a crucial fact: that our actions in the next few years will decide the world\u2019s future, and whether we can avoid the worst ravages of global heating or succumb to climate chaos. We must effectively eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, and nurture the natural world enough to absorb the remainder, by mid-century to avoid a future of catastrophic and irreversible climate chaos. Extreme weather is already driving 2 million people a week to seek humanitarian aid, and that is set to rise to 150 million in the next decade alone. The Guardian will try to answer your questions on the climate strikes and the forces shaping them.

The US is set to stage its largest ever day of protest over the climate crisis, with tens of thousands of students set to be joined by adults in abandoning schools and workplaces for a wave of strikes across the country. Climate strikes will take place in more than 1,000 locations, with major rallies in New York, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. The young strikers\u2019 totemic figure, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, will take part in the New York walkout and will speak to massed protesters in Manhattan. Authorities in New York City have announced that its student population of 1.1 million is allowed to skip school in order to attend the strikes. Dozens of companies, including Patagonia and Ben and Jerry\u2019s, will support striking staff, with major unions also backing the walkouts. Dulce Belen Ceballos Arias, an 18-year-old from San Francisco, said she will be striking because \u201cI want children of my own and I want them to have a better life than me. I don\u2019t want that to be taken away by climate change.\u201d Students in Boston will also be excused school, with a crowd of 10,000 expected to assemble. \u201cWe are excited to disrupt business as usual, to demand a Green New Deal,\u201d said Audrey Maurine Xin Lin, an 18-year-old organizer in Boston, in reference to the resolution put forward by progressive Democrats to enact a second world war-style mobilization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. A big difference on today\u2019s march in London is the presence of trade union activists alongside young people and their parents, writes Guardian environment correspondent Matthew Taylor, Graham Petersen, from the UCU lecturers\u2019 union and member of the green jobs alliance, said unions had to take a lead in the climate fight. This is going to be the defining issue for future generations and if we are not involved now how are we going to be relevant to the young people here today when they go into work. Trade unions around the world are backing today\u2019s protests and Petersen said it was \u201cabout time\u201d they engaged in the climate crisis. In the UK it is difficult because people have their hands full with austerity and precarious jobs but unions are starting to realise that if we get the climate justice policies right we can tackle not just the climate but also a wider social justice issues. Lois Borny has been speaking to young people on the London march, including student Noemie, who told her: It\u2019s depressing knowing you\u2019re waking up to not such a bright future. The climate crisis has always been in the back of my mind, but I always used to be a bit of a pessimist ... now that the movement has gained traction you get the feeling that you can change something. When asked what she thinks about the fact children are leading the movement she says: It almost seems like a game for them [the politicians]. They aren\u2019t taking it seriously. This isn\u2019t for fun or just for the sake of it. It\u2019s real and urgent. It is Nazreen\u2019s first day in London, having arrived from Malaysia yesterday. The 22-year-old, who is studying political philosophy, said: I\u2019m happy this is happening because at home we have a big haze problem, because of forests being burned in Borneo. Nazreen says that if we were in Borneo, from where we are standing (by the stage) the Houses of Parliament would be unrecognisable from the haze. Borneo is burning. It has one of the oldest rainforest in the world and half of it is gone. We are really proud of our rainforests, but what is there to be proud of when it is gone? He says that it is good children are leading the movement, because it is allowing them to see \u201cwhat is happening in the real world\u201d. A small but noisy crowd gathered in the financial district of Sandton in Johannesburg, outside the offices of Sasol, a huge South African energy and chemical company. Natalie Kapsosideris, 16, said: We don\u2019t really have a way out of this. The future looks really dismal at this point. There\u2019s not going to be a lot of food available, there will be droughts, floods, natural disasters. The fact that Sasol gets away with stealing our future from us ... and it\u2019s all because they want to make money. Tariro Banganayi, 18, a student at Sacred Heart college, said: It\u2019s important that I lend my voice to this cause ... a lot of people who aren\u2019t as privileged as I am don\u2019t have the opportunity to speak out against these sorts of issues, who live where the air is unbreathable, where toxic waste is dumped in rivers, those people don\u2019t have a voice to speak out ... Also I am here to educate people about these issues and to get as much information from as many different places as I can ... I am going to try to diversify the way that I raise awareness ... I am going to use my social media a lot more effectively, I am going to centre my conversations with my friends, I am going to bring it up at the dinner table with my family ... because if every person tells one person then we can tell everybody. Crowds of students in Delhi are blocking the road near to Lodhi Gardens, chanting: \u201cWhat do we want? Climate justice.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t run away from climate change,\u201d reads one sign. Delhi is one of 21 cities predicted to run out of groundwater by 2020, according to the Indian government\u2019s policy thinktank, Niti Aayog. It is also one of the most polluted cities in the world.\u201cThe lungs of an 11 year old have black spots on them,\u201d Shivam, a law student, says. \u201cThis is why we have to change things now.\u201d In Exeter, the protest is in full swing. Leon Hayton-Twigg, 11, (pictured below with his brother Lucas and his friend Ossian Finn, 10) says: \u201cWe have come here to show the people there\u2019s a problem and we want it to stop.\u201d More of the protest signs from the Exeter strikes ... Archie Graham, 15, and his friends were supposed to be in school today but felt compelled to join Manchester\u2019s climate strike, while still rocking their school ties. He said: What\u2019s the point in going to school if we can\u2019t use that knowledge in the future because there won\u2019t be a future for us. His friend, Sam Pembroke, added: It\u2019s really important because there\u2019s no second chance - this is the only chance we have. If this carries on it\u2019s just going to end. Their friend, Santana Daza, 15, said they might get in trouble for bunking off school but it was worth it: I think it definitely does make a difference. They encourage us to learn about it but we all know about climate change - we don\u2019t need to be educated about it, it\u2019s more about taking action. Herding a group of six placard-carrying children, Kitty Rostron, 40, said her seven-year-old daughter Margot watches Greta Thunberg on YouTube and asks: Why is this happening? Why is Boris Johnson not doing anything? Why do people not make good decisions about climate change? Her friend Karine Joshua, 39, said it was important to bring children along so they understand what is happening to the environment: There\u2019s a real crisis right now, not in 10, 20 years time. Action is needed now so we\u2019re trying to teach them if we come together and show our support hopefully we can make a change. Here is a selection of images from other climate strikers: Hello, this is Haroon Siddique taking over from Sarah. The video below shows a small proportion of the staff who walked out at the Guardian. If you want to get in touch, please tweet me @Haroon_Siddique The Guardian live blog will be closing from noon (12:00 BST) until 12.30 BST as we are participating in a solidarity strike. When it resumes, my colleague Haroon Siddique will be taking over. In an email to staff explaining why we are walking out for 30 minutes, Guardian editor in chief, Katharine Viner, said: We fully support this global campaign, and we want colleagues to feel able to show solidarity with campaigners - so we are happy to support this activity across the organisation. Sadiq Khan is not the only mayor who has come out strongly behind today\u2019s strikes. The leaders of Paris, New York City, Los Angeles and Copenhagen released a strongly worded joint statement overnight. Our shared planet is facing a climate emergency. The science is clear that, without urgent action, sea levels will rise further, extreme temperatures will become the norm and climate-related disasters will inflict even greater damage. We are making historic investments to prepare and adapt our cities to the inevitable consequences of emissions already released into the atmosphere. When your house is on fire, somebody needs to sound the alarm. Young people in our cities, displaying incredible maturity and dignity are doing just that. School children are taking to the streets, drawing attention to the terrifying threat that climate breakdown poses to their future. Young people recognise just how unfair climate change is. Those who have generated the least greenhouse gas emissions, including the poorest, most disadvantaged and youngest in society, will suffer the worst effects of a rapidly changing global climate. They are right to sound the alarm, and they are right to demand action that tackles climate change and inequality simultaneously. On September 20, these inspiring young leaders have called for adults to join them for a Global Climate Strike. We have an opportunity to show, not only that we hear their message, but that they have inspired us to act even faster. As mayors, our greatest responsibility is to protect the lives and wellbeing of those that live in our cities. As adults, our obligation is to leave the world in a better state for our children than we inherited it. Fortunately, the evidence is increasingly clear that transforming our cities to prevent the climate crisis will also make them healthier, more equitable, safer and ultimately better places to live. The cities of the future will enjoy affordable and reliable public transport; the air will be free from poisonous toxins; buildings will generate zero emissions thanks to ultra-high efficient heating, cooling and insulation; waste will be recycled or reused, and all of this will be powered by abundant renewable energy. We have a unique opportunity to bestow a bright and hopeful legacy to the next generation. This is the future we want. That is why we are supporting the Global Climate Strikes. Mayors around the world, working through C40 Cities, are committed to deliver on the Paris Agreement and taking action to peak their emissions as our cities already have and bring them down sharply by 2030. Many businesses, investors, labour groups, faith leaders and local communities share our urgency. But we cannot tackle the climate crisis alone. We need science-based action from every sector of the economy, and we expect greater leadership from nation states. Young people are telling us that the climate emergency demands an emergency response. We couldn\u2019t agree more. It was signed by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, as well as the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, and the lord mayor of Copenhagen, Frank Jensen. Lovely thread by Mary Hamilton on what to do if you cannot make the strikes today but still want to make an effort to reduce your waste. Ruby, 10, and Dougie, 7, (pictured below), were the first to start striking outside the Scottish parliament, back on a cold dark 11 January. Back then it was just them and the police. Seeing how big the movement has become, Ruby says she feels \u201chappy and proud\u201d. \u201cAmazing,\u201d says Dougie. Staff at the Guardian will be striking today at noon, so there will be no posts on the live blog between 12:00 BST and 12:30 BST. The fashion industry is a fossil-fuel-guzzling operation, as many of our clothes are made from petroleum-based textiles such as polyester. Even natural fibres such as cotton have a huge carbon footprint and require a large portion of the world\u2019s pesticides. In a bid to solve this disastrous environmental equation, scientists and designers are creating completely new textiles from fast-growing, carbon-sucking organisms such as micro- and macro-algae, mycelium (elements of fungus), bacteria and fermented yeast. These new biotechnologies efficiently convert sunlight and CO2 into mass raw materials, suck carbon out of the atmosphere and pave the way to a carbon-negative wardrobe. Tens of thousands of young people and adults are already streaming into the streets around Westminster in central London, and organisers say the protest, which was formally due to start at 11am, already dwarfs previous school strike demonstrations. Among those gathered in the sunshine were a group of medics. Isobel Braithwaite, a public health doctor from London, said they were there because the climate crisis was also a health crisis: \u201cFrom heatwaves to floods; food shortages to devastating storms, these things are having a huge impact on health now and it is going to get worse.\u201d She said it was time adults listened to young people who had taken the lead in addressing this crisis. \u201cWe need urgent widespread action and it must happen quickly... we are running out of time.\u201d Glorious scenes in Edinburgh as thousands of children, parents, students and musicians gather at the Meadows for the Climate Strike. \u201cThis is our Earth and our future. We need to take care of it,\u201d said 11-year-old Leila Koita, pictured here with friends Eilidh Tedesco, Norah Turner, Tilly Torrie, Megan Berger and Nan Zhang. Norah\u2019s mum, Jo Spencely, says she hasn\u2019t been on a demo for decades but she is here to show support. \u201cI\u2019m massively concerned about their future. I almost can\u2019t bear to read about the climate. It\u2019s so scary.\u201d The march sets off at 11:30am and will pass through Edinburgh city centre and end with a rally in front of the Scottish parliament. As in London, police have imposed restrictions, in this case by refusing permission for the marchers to walk down Princes Street. As elsewhere, this is just the start of a week of climate action. On Saturday, activists will stage a \u201cdie in\u201d, Monday will be a \u201cday of disruption\u201d, musicians will join a \u201cLove the Planet festival\u201d on Wednesday, and there\u2019ll be another rally outside parliament the following day. Even Emmeline Pankhurst has joined in the protests in Manchester. A statue of the suffragette hero has donned a bright orange lifejacket and has a placard that asks: \u201cReady for rising sea levels to reach this height?\u201d The stunt was the idea of Katie Bradshaw and Ryan Griffiths, both 31, who described themselves as first-protesters who felt the need to act today. \u201cEmmeline still carries that Mancunian spirit of standing up for what she believes in and great causes,\u201d said Griffiths. \u201cClimate change is so important and we think it\u2019s an issue she would be at the forefront of if she were around today.\u201d Bradshaw added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do our bit, even if it\u2019s just putting some signs up and making people realise we need to look after our planet. If she was around today she\u2019d be supporting it.\u201d Friends of the Earth, an international network of environmental organisations in 74 countries, is calling on people across Britain to join young people in striking against climate change. Muna Suleiman, a Friends of the Earth campaigner, said: Most of us want to fix the climate crisis. And it can be done. But we need our politicians to act. Climate breakdown is already hurting people around the world, with many of those who have contributed least to the crisis being subjected to the harshest impacts. \u201cAnd right when we need our leaders to step up, they continue to let us down. From filling the skies with more planes, to backing fracking in the UK and funding oil and gas projects abroad. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re standing shoulder to shoulder with young people to call on our politicians to deliver emergency climate action now. And we\u2019re asking everyone to join us.\u201d Bob Dylan\u2019s Blowin\u2019 in the Wind kicks off Berlin\u2019s \u201cKlimastreik\u201d to huge cheers from the thousands gathered, although no official estimates of the numbers attending are available yet. Contender for banner of the day is: \u2018Grandpa what is a snowman?\u2019 Hundreds of people are streaming through the portals of the Brandenburg Gate, through the Tiergarten Park and from every direction onto Platz des 18. M\u00e4rz. Lots of Berlin\u2019s young are here with the blessing of their parents and teachers, though many have defied their schools to be here. At 1pm, the student strikers are planning to let off alarm clocks across the UK, and are encouraging businesses to set off their fire alarms at the same time in support. Jake Woodier, the campaign co-ordinator at UK Student Climate Network, said: \u201cYoung people across the world have taken the lead in highlighting the need for urgent climate action over the past year. \u201cThey are calling for adults to join them for the global climate strike, just three days before the UN climate action summit to pressure our governments to act to tackle the climate crisis. \u201cRaise the Alarm will help draw attention to the climate emergency in workplaces across the breadth of the UK,\u201d Woodier said. Students at Torquay Girls\u2019 Grammar school have made a video about climate change. What\u2019s the carbon footprint of my trip? The square outside Manchester\u2019s grand central library has been taken over by a sea of people carrying homemade placards and chanting. Hundreds of those gathered sang \u201cWhose planet? Our planet!\u201d with scores of children among the protesters. Nellie Jacobs, 10, and her mother Helen said they were motivated to take part in the global climate strike after their hometown Whaley Bridge was evacuated earlier this month when it was deluged with months-worth of rain in a short period, causing a dam to burst and dozens of properties to flood. Nice cartoon just in from reader Jesse Leonard. You get the picture, literally. Possibly the first time the climate crisis has been likened to a purple piano, but why not? If there are any other artists out there with climate emergency sketches/drawings/cartoons, send them in via this link. The Kichwa tribe in the Sarayaku region of the Amazon in Ecuador believe in the \u201cliving forest\u201d, where humans, animals and plants live in harmony. They are fighting oil companies who want to exploit their ancestral land. A delegation of indigenous people are at the Paris COP21 climate conference to make sure their voices are heard. Can they win their battle? Tweeting a photo from a climate strike, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: Kate Connolly, the Guardian and Observer\u2019s Berlin correspondent, has been out this morning in the German capital. Strikes are planned for at least seven Nigerian cities, such as Lagos, which is clogged by mountains of toxic waste including thousands of tons of e-waste from the EU, particularly the UK and Germany. There will be a protest in Port Harcourt, capital of the country\u2019s oil-producing region, whose residents and their possessions have been covered in soot for the past few years, believed to be the result of destroying illegal oil refineries. There will also be two protests against a proposed coal plant in San Pedro in Ivory Coast, while in Ghana, a group called Young Reporters for the Environment is leading a march from the city hall of the capital, Accra. Next Friday, there will be a demonstration in Kumasi, the capital of Ghana\u2019s Ashanti region. Ghana is losing its rainforests faster than any other country, with a 60% increase in primary forest loss from 2017 to 2018. In Senegal, there are marches in Rufisque and Thies this Friday, a climate camp in Kaolack on Sunday, followed by a demonstration against a new coal plant in Bargny, and a march in the capital, Dakar on the 27th. Air pollution in Dakar is causing more and more respiratory problems, in large part because of \u201cdirty\u201d, sulphur-laden diesel. Environmental activists Greta Thunberg and George Monbiot have helped produce a short film highlighting the need to protect, restore and use nature to tackle the climate crisis. Berlin\u2019s main transport line, the S-Bahn, has virtually ground to a halt this morning due to a major engineering breakdown leaving many protesters stranded and unable to reach the protest. Participants are being encouraged to take their bikes instead. Many have pointed out the irony. Meanwhile, at the Brandenburg Gate, scene of the main protest in Berlin that is due to kick off just before noon, protesters have been organised into neat blocks. Apart from the huge crowds of protesters, the other uplifting piece of climate news today is that onshore wind has just became the cheapest source of energy in the UK. Industry analysts can\u2019t believe how quickly the price has fallen. This shows the transition away from fossil fuels is much more affordable than people dared hope five years ago. On the business side of things, also encouraging to note efforts by companies with a green reputation, who seem to be competing to do more by selling less. The Patagonia outdoor clothing store will close all its European outlets today and next Friday so staff can join the protests. Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s and Lush also shutting today. Burton, the winter sports chain, is giving workers a paid day off to join the strike and have halted online sales for 24 hours. The company\u2019s webpage today reads \u201cClosed for business. Open for action. Let\u2019s protect our playground.\u201d In London, where big crowds are expected to gather near Westminster from 11am, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has thrown his weight behind today\u2019s strikes. He told the Guardian this morning he fully supports schools across the city who are \u201cworking with pupils and allowing them time, without sanction, to peacefully and lawfully join the strikes today\u201d. \u201cIt is unbelievable that we need strike action for the future of our planet to be taken seriously by government\u2019s around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI fully support the thousands of young people peacefully and lawfully protesting around the country today who feel so strongly about the climate change emergency and I share their frustration. The stark reality is we are running out of time for meaningful change. The climate crisis is one of the very biggest challenges we face \u2013 I have declared a climate emergency in London \u2013 and governments around the world are failing to take the action we need.\u201d Berlin has kicked off its Fridays For Future this morning with road blockades, cycle rallies and a demonstration in front of the cuboid chancellery of Angela Merkel, where about 40 young people have unfurled a banner asking: \u201cReturn of the climate chancellor?\u201d It\u2019s an appeal to Merkel, once environment minister, to live up to the reputation she is seen to have squandered over everything from her support of the car industry to her refusal to back a phase-out of brown coal mining. They are keen to pressurise her coalition government ahead of the launch of its much-awaited package of climate emergency measures which the cabinet has spent the night negotiating and is due to launch early this afternoon. The protesters are chanting: \u201dWir sind hier, wir sind laut, weil Ihr uns die Zukunft raubt.\u201c \u2013\u201cWe are here and we are loud, because you\u2019re stealing our future\u201d. The main protest at the Brandenburg Gate is due to start just before noon. When there is protest in Berlin, there is usually also techno, and from 3pm a \u201cRave Rebellion\u201d march will depart from Potsdamer Platz square, under the motto \u201cNo Future No Dancefloor\u201d. Extinction Rebellion has announced plans to block traffic at strategic points \u201cwhere it will hurt drivers\u201d around the capital. Elsewhere, 400 protests have been announced across the country, which will likely attracts adults as well as children. An umbrella organisation that includes organisations such as \u201cPsychologists for Future\u201d, \u201cEntrepreneurs for Future\u201d and \u201cGrandparents for Future\u201d has called for people to join in, as has the services union Verdi and the German Protestant Church. \u201cWe stand side by side with Fridays for Future\u201d, said Annette Kurschus, the president of the Protestant Church of Westphalia, \u201cPlanet Earth does not belong to us, it has only been entrusted in our care\u201d. Germany has two faces when it comes to the environment: the country that prides itself in its high recycling rates, phasing out nuclear power and pioneering renewable energies is still the world\u2019s sixth biggest pollutant, with 865m tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2018. Borne out of this realisation, much of the recent debate in the country has focused on the phase-out of the country\u2019s approximately 130 smoke-belching coal plants. The government wants to close them down by 2038 \u2013 too soon for many unions, especially in the coal-rich east, and too late for climate activists galvanised by Fridays for Future. In Europe\u2019s \u201ccar nation\u201d, air pollution through exhaust fumes is another contentious issue, with some cities having introduced driving bans for diesel cars last year. The Fridays for Future protests have had a tangible effect on the political climate, with several polls earlier this year showing the Green party emerging as the strongest political force in the country. Many other parties have tried to copy its message, with even the arch-conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union calling for a coal phase-out by 2030, bans on plastic bags and new wind farms. Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government is expected to announce a plan for tackling climate change, rumoured to involve \u20ac75bn of investment by 2030, just in time for Friday\u2019s climate strike. The planet\u2019s average temperature started a steady climb two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. Heatwaves, droughts and floods are likely in the future if urgent action isn\u2019t taken to stop climate change, experts warn. It comes as strikes take place across the world on Friday, calling on governments to take immediate action on climate change. The demonstrates have been planned ahead of the landmark UN climate action summit in New York on 23 September World leaders will discuss how they can reduce their carbon emissions with the aim of stopping global temperature rise from exceeding 1.5\u00b0C under the Paris agreement. Prof Nigel Arnell, professor of climate system science at the University of Reading: This week, the United Nations general assembly will be discussing how to encourage countries to be more ambitious in their targets to reduce future emissions of greenhouse gases. It\u2019s clear that increased effort is needed if we are to avoid significant climate change impacts. We\u2019re probably already seeing some of the consequences of climate change \u2013 heatwaves, wildfires, unusually slow and intense hurricanes \u2013 and things will get much worse if we continue on our current path of increasing emissions. We recently published a study showing the number of people exposed to major heatwaves would increase from 330 million per year now to up to 8 billion per year in 2050 \u2013 just 30 years away - the number people exposed to drought would increase from 400 million per year to up to 1 billion per year, and the number of people affected by flooding from major rivers would increase from 15 million per year now to up to 100 million per year. Reducing emissions now will reduce these impacts, but at the same time we also need to increase efforts to enhance resilience to the impacts that are inevitable following our emissions so far.\u201d Keith Shine, regius professor of meteorology and climate science at the University of Reading: We are coming to the end of another decade. Each of the past four decades has, when averaged over the whole planet, been 0.1 to 0.2 degrees celsius warmer than the decade before; carbon dioxide levels have continued their relentless rise; and methane levels have grown much more rapidly than in the previous decade. Unless things start to change markedly over the coming decade, it is going to get harder and harder to meet the goals of the UN\u2019s Paris agreement on climate change.\u201d Protests taking place in Johannesburg, South Africa\u2019s biggest city and capital of Gauteng province. The Guardian environment journalist Fiona Harvey will be on hand to answer any questions you have about the climate crisis between 1.30 and 2.30pm BST. You can share your questions now via our form here, or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they\u2019ll be easier for us to find. With hundreds of thousands of children joining the global youth strike in cities around the globe, Extinction Rebellion UK said it stands in solidarity with all those striking. Caspar Hughes, 48, a Extinction Rebellion activist and father of school striker Max, 12, said: \u201cParents have left their children to clear up the climate and ecological crisis they have created. The youth should be out partying rather than protesting.\u201d Extinction Rebellion activists will join the strikes in London and are holding their own actions and performances. At 2.30pm, a concert will take place in Victoria Tower Gardens, London. Jonathan Watts, the Guardian\u2019s global environment editor, has written about young activists calling for north-south solidarity to the tackle climate emergency. He writes: While previous generations failed to notice the slowly shifting baselines, today\u2019s young will watch the sixth great wave of extinction accelerate before their eyes. Due to warming seas and acid bleaching, coral reef systems will flicker out one by one. Species that existed for millions of years will tip into the abyss. Among those closest to the edge are the black rhino, the Chinese giant salamander, the Siberian crane, the Western gorilla, the Ganges dolphin, Bactrian camels, Pygmi sloths and Attenborough\u2019s long-beaked echidna. Thousands of species of insects, plants and amphibians may go extinct before they are discovered. For many young people today, their only chance of seeing unspoiled beaches, savannahs, reefs and forests will be on old documentaries, 3D interactives or their grandparents\u2019 holiday videos. Picturesque landscapes that defined communities and nations will be transformed. Read the full article here. The climate change strikes have spread far and wide, including the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. By William Yang in Taipei In Taiwan, dozens of representatives from primary schools, high schools, and universities gathered in the capital, Taipei, to launch a petition called \u201cFridays for the future\u201d. The aim of it is to press candidates in the upcoming presidential election to lay out concrete policies to mitigate climate change risks that Taiwan faces. Some held signs that said: \u201cIt\u2019s getting hot in here\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t drop it like it\u2019s hot\u201d, after popular song lyrics. Student activists spoke on stage, sharing their personal reasons for joining the global campaign to fight climate change. Wei Hung-zhan, aged nine, said: \u201cOur future has been sacrificed by the older generation.\u201d He asked: \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the older generation remembered to share earth\u2019s resources with the next generation?\u201d Students said that they planned to mail their petitions to each presidential candidate\u2019s office and ask politicians to provide complete responses to their demands through online live-broadcasts in a month. The event\u2019s organiser Chang Li-Wen said: \u201cThe only candidate who cares about Taiwan\u2019s future is the person who proposes a complete set of climate change policies.\u201d Over the next week, a series of climate change events are scheduled across Taiwan, including major rallies in Taipei and Kaohsiung on 27 September. People are taking to the streets in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, in southern Asia. Climate change in Bangladesh is a pressing issue. According to National Geographic, Bangladesh is one the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change. Millions are marching across the globe in what could be the largest climate protest in history. The first of the worldwide protests took place in Australia, where an estimated 300,000 people gathered at more than 100 rallies calling for action to guard against climate change. Other demonstrations were held across parts of Asia. In the UK, children and young people across the country will walk out of lessons and lectures They will be joined by hundreds of thousands of workers. The school strikes movement was sparked by the teenage activist Greta Thunberg who demonstrated at the Swedish parliament. The first large-scale protests of Friday\u2019s \u201cglobal climate strike\u201d took place in Sydney and Canberra, with demonstrators calling on leaders in Australia, the world\u2019s largest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas, to take more drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Similar rallies are planned for around the world, with 800 events set to take place in the US and 400 in Germany. The protests come ahead of a climate summit at the UN next week convened by the secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, to urge countries to up their climate efforts. Much stronger measures are needed across the globe to prevent temperature rises of more than 1.5C (2.7F) or 2C (3.6F) to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: \u201cIt is unbelievable that we should need global strike action for the future of our planet to be taken seriously. The stark reality is that our climate is changing rapidly and we are running out of time to address it. \u201cI hope governments around the world who are failing to take action hear the voices of millions of people, young and old, unified in their call for action to save our planet. Our future depends on it.\u201d The level of CO2 has been rising since the industrial revolution and is at its highest for about 4 million years. The rate of the rise is even more striking \u2013 the fastest for 66m years \u2013 with scientists saying we are in \u201cuncharted territory\u201d. Strikes are also taking place in Uganda, east Africa. They are also under way in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital. Events in Italy will be held throughout the coming week, culminating with demonstrations in more than 100 cities on Friday 27 September. \u201cItalian schools only went back last week and we needed some time to plan and mobilise, so we voted to hold the major demonstrations on the 27th,\u201d said David Wicker, a representative of the Turin branch of Fridays for Future Italia. More than 470,000 people took part in the first global climate strike in Italy on 15 March and a similar number is expected to join next week\u2019s demonstrations. Though Italy\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have been decreasing over the past decade, the country was criticised this year by the European Climate Foundation for failing to provide an adequate plan to further reduce emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. Activists are hoping Italy\u2019s new left-leaning coalition will take concrete action and fulfil its pledge of making environmental issues a priority. \u201cThey need to entirely cut the subsidies and investments going to the fossil fuel industry,\u201d said Wicker, aged 14. \u201cAnd we need to start immediate investment in green energy to help society have an ecological transition.\u201d Young activists for Fridays for Future in Turin, one of the most polluted cities in Europe, have been holding the local authority to account over its environmental policies. \u201cThe town hall gives us feedback every two months and we give this information to scientists, who will say whether anything is really being done or not,\u201d said Wicker. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government has set the object of making France carbon-neutral by 2050. However, greenhouse gas emissions have risen in the country since 2015, and in 2017 were said to be 7% above official targets. Climate change activists say Macron has gone back on promises. Sceptics doubt claims the government would renovate 500,000 buildings a year to use less energy and are angry at what is seen as bowing to the powerful agriculture lobby over pesticides. Meanwhile, it is the mainstream centre-right that has proven most resistant to Greta Thunberg\u2019s appeals. The announcement that the Swedish teenager was to address the French assembl\u00e9e nationale in July provoked outbursts of indignation and insults from opposition MPs. \u201cDon\u2019t expect me to be applauding a prophet in short trousers,\u201d tweeted one. Others appealed for a boycott of her address. Le Monde pointed out French climate change sceptics were no longer attacking the message but the messenger and pointed to a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against Thunberg. After a slow start \u2013 an action that involved only 150 protesters in February in Nantes, reports suggest 56 organisations, ecology associations and social rights groups in France plan to demonstrate on Friday and Saturday. Youth for Climate France has organised a number of marches across France, and youngsters cave called on adults to join their action. They urged citizens: \u201cStrike for the climate, which means above all leave your home, your office, your farm or your factory. Smashing the status quo requires the involvement of everyone: sportsmen and women, actors, teachers, food industry workers, psychologists, delivery people, it doesn\u2019t matter. Whatever our position, we can all bring our stone to the building by refusing to accept the status quo.\u201d In Paris, a march will begin at Place de la Nation and finish with a gathering at Parc de Bercy with workshops, conferences and \u201ccitizens\u2019 meetings\u201d. Several French unions including the powerful CFDT and CGT have issued calls for joint mobilisation. The action group Lib\u00e9rons le Louvre (Liberate the Louvre) is planning an action at the museum in protest at its long-standing partnership with the petrol group Total. Last year, black-clad members of the ecology association 350.org lay down in one of the Louvre\u2019s galleries in protest at Total\u2019s financial support of the museum, which dates back more than 20 years and which Louvre officials say has funded \u201cexhibitions, renovations, educational and cultural activities and social actions\u201d. Among the specific demands of French climate activists is that the French national education system introduces the teaching of the \u201cenvironmental situation\u201d and that France and the European Union officially declare a state of \u201cclimate, environmental and social\u201d emergency. In France, a second day of protests on Saturday is planned to mark World CleanUp Day. A government minister said he cannot endorse children leaving school to take part in the climate strikes. Minister for business, energy and clean growth Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Breakfast on Friday that he supported the \u201cenergy and creativity\u201d of students but said time spent in school was \u201cincredibly important\u201d. When asked if the government was listening to the young protesters, he said: \u201cTheir voices are being heard ... What I do support is their energy, their creativity, and the fact that they have completely mastered these issues and take them very seriously. \u201cI am not going to endorse people leaving school because I think education, time spent in school is incredibly important.\u201d Here are the final exclusive Twitter figures for the climate strike in Australia. And this is what the school strike conversation has looked like on Twitter in the past three days leading up to today\u2019s demonstrations: There is a lot planned for South Africa today, with demonstrations in Johannesburg, the commercial capital, on the south-eastern coast in Durban, in Pretoria, and in Cape Town, where there\u2019ll be a march on parliament. Ayakha Melithafa, 17, said she would be joining the global strike in Cape Town.The march won\u2019t start until early afternoon to allow students to finish most of the school day. \u201cWe\u2019ll be marching to parliament to demand that the government take this issue seriously. It needs to declare a climate emergency here in South Africa, and a moratorium on coal, gas and oil mining licences. They have just ignored the problem so far,\u201d Melithafa said. South Africa is one of the continent\u2019s most developed economies and relies heavily on coal powered energy generation. It is building new and very big coal-fired power stations. \u201cWe have arranged with our teachers to leave early. it is up to us. We are the leaders of today. We don\u2019t just want the system to change. We want a brand new system which will help us live sustainably with a bright new future,\u201d Melithafa said. A roundup of what is happening around Europe on Friday: France Youth for Climate France has organised a number of marches across the country, and youngsters cave called on adults to join their action. In Paris, a march will begin at Place de la Nation and finish with a gathering at Parc de Bercy with workshops, conferences and \u201ccitizens\u2019 meetings\u201d. A second day of protests on Saturday are planned to mark World CleanUp Day. Italy More than 470,000 people took part in the first global climate strike in Italy on 15 March and a similar number is expected to join next Friday\u2019s demonstrations. Germany Nearly 500 climate change demonstrations are planned across Germany on Friday. In Berlin, several demonstrations will take place throughout the day. The Fridays for Future gathering starts at noon at the Brandenburg Gate under the motto: \u201cEveryone for the climate.\u201d Organisers expect 10,000 people. Why is this week important? The strikes take place ahead of the UN general assembly and the climate action summit on 23 September. The summit will bring together governments, the private sector, civil society, local authorities and other international organisations to develop ambitious solutions. The world\u2019s leaders will converge on New York for the assembly, where each is given an (unenforced) time limit of 15 minutes to speak in front of the green marble podium. Leaders occupy positions in the hall in alphabetical order by country name, usually with a different nation occupying the first seat each year. General assembly week usually makes news in the first day or two, when the US president and other powerful heads of state tend to have their moment, and then attention tends to tail off. For that reason, there is always some horse trading before the general assembly week, with prime ministers from big countries trying to swap speaking slots with presidents of small countries.

Activists on bicycles block traffic at Ernst-Reuter-Platz square in Berlin, Germany, as they take part in the global climate strike today. There will be a \u201cspecial takeover\u201d of Channel 4\u2019s usual evening weather report today, as the network joins the world\u2019s largest climate strike. The channel\u2019s social media accounts will also join the walkout, bosses said, and will be going on strike between 9.30am and 5.30pm. Additionally, continuity announcers will share facts drawn from World Meteorological Organisation research throughout the day on Channel 4. No details were given on the nature of the weather forecast\u2019s \u201cspecial takeover\u201d. Across Britain, thousands will take part in a march. Worldwide, campaigners say there are more than 3,400 events planned in 120 countries, with numbers taking part expected to surpass the estimated 1.6 million people who took part in the global strike in March. The outdoor apparel brand Patagonia is closing every store worldwide to encourage employees and customers to join the climate strike. Demonstrators from more than 150 countries are expected to put pressure on governments and decision-makers to do more about climate issues. The strikes come ahead of the United Nations climate change summit, which begins on 23 September. While in the UK and many other countries the strike is taking place today, in some countries such as Italy and the Netherlands the strike is happening next Friday, 27 September. Explaining the decision to close stores, Ryan Gellert, the general manager, EMEA, Patagonia, said: \u201cThe climate crisis is a human issue \u2013 affecting all of us ... As a global business, we will be closing our stores on 20 and 27 September, striking with the youth activists and calling for governments around the world to take action.\u201d The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will today thank young people for educating the world about the climate crisis. Speaking at the youth climate strike, Corbyn will also criticise the prime minister, Boris Johnson, for calling global warming a \u201cprimitive fear\u201d. He is expected to say: To the young people leading by example today here and across the world, I want to say thank you: thank you for educating us about the climate crisis and the emergency of species extinction and biodiversity loss. I know the situation can look bleak. We have a prime minister that has called global warming a \u2018primitive fear without foundation\u2019. The US president is a full-blown climate denier, putting our planet in danger by pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. And the Amazon is on fire, looted by big corporations with a Brazilian president watching on who doesn\u2019t care. But when we see young people demanding urgent action, it\u2019s an inspiration. When I see this movement growing \u2013 and it\u2019s growing every day \u2013 I know we can tackle the climate emergency. The next Labour government will welcome your pressure and hear your demands for change. We will kick-start a green Industrial revolution and protect our planet, so it\u2019s there to give life and joy to generations to come.\u201d I will be picking up the live blog from the Guardian\u2019s London offices. Please share any photographs or comments from where you are with me: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com I\u2019ll be handing over the blog now to my colleague Sarah Marsh. There are still hundreds of places, thousands of students and hours of protest to come. Stay with us as the strikes sweep across Asia, Africa and Europe, and into the Americas. There will also be plenty more Australian news and analysis to come. To recap what we\u2019ve seen across Asia and the Pacific today: At least 300,000 people have taken part in the largest climate strike across Australia yet. Melbourne\u2019s event drew 100-150,000 people, and Sydney\u2019s 80-100,000. Hobart\u2019s 22,000 attendees made it Tasmania\u2019s biggest ever strike action. Hundreds of regional centres joined in \u2013 from Alice Springs, Byron Bay and Katherine. As part of Guardian Australia\u2019s coverage, the federal energy minister, the opposition energy spokesman and two of the country\u2019s biggest energy companies took questions from students. In Vanuatu, the deputy prime minister spoke directly to the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as countries \u201cto blame for this threat to our survival\u201d. Protests also unfolded in the Solomon Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, India, Pakistan and more. As our Australian coverage wraps up, here\u2019s a great round-table discussion from some Brisbane students. They\u2019ve finally started marching in Melbourne. And here\u2019s our video wrap of the thousands on the streets today. More from Lisa Cox in Melbourne Edie Shepherd, a Wiradjuri and Noongar woman, spoke to the crowd earlier. She said she\u2019d recently visited communities in the Lake Woods region in the NT, an area that gas companies are proposing to frack. \u201cWhile Lake Woods usually flows with water, this time it ran dry,\u201d she said. As well as students, unions are here today. Sam Davis is a member of the National Union of Workers and was here with his young family. \u201cWe want to show that climate justice is very important to workers as well. A lot of our workers are going to be impacted by climate change in the near future too,\u201d he says. \u201cThe values we have as unionists are why I\u2019ve brought my kids.\u201d They\u2019ve started in Mumbai: In Pakistan: While in Melbourne, the crowd is so big it\u2019s going to take a few more hours: If you\u2019re waking up in Europe and the UK, then here is where you can find a protest near you: And here\u2019s First Dog\u2019s last cartoon for today: The organisers of the School Strike For Climate have estimated more than 300,000 people took to the streets across Australia today. More than double the number of Australians who rallied at climate strikes in March came out today, with an estimated 100,000 in Melbourne, 80,000 in Sydney, 30,000 in Brisbane, 20,000 in Hobart, 15,000 in Canberra, 10,000 in Perth and 10,000 in Adelaide, not to mention the other more than 100 events in non-capital cities and towns. Organisations striking included 33 Australian unions, 2,500 businesses including Atlassian, Canva, Domain and Intrepid, and faith institutions including the Anglican Church &amp; Uniting Church, they said. There are well over 100,000 people here in Melbourne and organisers are talking about 150,000. Niamh, 17, from Castlemaine told the crowd: \u201cI fight for climate justice because everyone deserves a safe future. The government is not supporting it yet, but together we will change that.\u201d Freya, 16, from Melbourne said: \u201cThe climate crisis is a human and global issue, and we need to act now.\u201d The students spoke about recent natural disasters around the world, including massive wildfires in the Amazon and the early bushfires that have caused devastation in Queensland and NSW. \u201cThis is predicted to get a lot worse if we don\u2019t act now,\u201d Niamh said. The students then spoke about the demands of young people striking today, which include the complete phase-out of fossil fuels. The students have gone to great lengths to talk about the need to secure the futures of workers in fossil fuel-intensive industries, whose livelihoods will be affected as economies become carbon-neutral. Freya said: \u201cWe understand the role fossil fuels have played in putting food on the table for families. It\u2019s vital we all work together, not against one another. It\u2019s not about jobs v the environment.\u201d Tens if not hundreds of thousands packed out Sydney\u2019s Domain park in the CBD. Moemoana, 18, has come from Wollongong to the protest, and her homeland is Samoa. She\u2019s here with members of the Matavai Pacific cultural centre. \u201cI\u2019ve come to fight for the Pacific. The Pacific Islands are [only] metres above sea level because of climate change and it\u2019s a scary future for our islands. We want to urge people to take some action. \u201cSeas are rising [in] Pacific Islands, especially Tuvalu and Kiribati, it\u2019s a real threat, and Australia needs to know that Pacifika are neighbours and Australia really needs to help out. 17-year-old protest organiser Daisy spoke of the third demand of the campaign: funding a just transition and job creation for all fossil-fuel workers and communities. \u201cWe need solutions that care for people and our planet,\u201d she said. \u201cClimate justice is not about jobs versus the environment. Just as climate change hurts people, unemployment hurts people.\u201d She said too many people were already suffering and would suffer if governments did not find solutions. \u201cIf our government cares about all of us then they need to get on with the job of stopping any new coal, oil and gas projects, powering Australia with 100% renewable energy by no later than 2030, and doing all this while funding just transition and jobs for all fossil fuel workers and their communities so that no one is left behind.\u201d Marlie Thomas, a Kamilaroi teenager from Gunnedah, said she was attending the rally on the authority of her elders, not the Department of Education. \u201cI\u2019ve had to help collect bottled water for our family in Walgett,\u201d she said. Former federal MP and City of Sydney councillor Kerryn Phelps told Guardian Australia cities \u201cneed to play their part when it comes planning for the future and mitigating climate change\u201d. \u201cThat includes our own operations, working with businesses and residents, providing incentives to people to reduce their carbon footprint, to encourage active public transport, to encourage renewable sources of energy. \u201cAnd because of the sheer size of the population, not only do they contribute so much to climate change risk but they also have the most, I think, to offer. Obviously we\u2019ve got the agriculture sector, which needs to play its part, the transport sector, but individuals also can do so much themselves.\u201d With the Australian strikes not even half over in many places, here\u2019s what has happened so far: Hundreds of thousands have participated in the largest climate strike across Australia yet: more than 100 locations, from capital cities to regional centres such as Alice Springs, Byron Bay and Katherine. In Sydney and Melbourne crowds were estimated at 80,000 to 150,000 respectively, making them the biggest demonstrations since the Iraq war. In Tasmania 22,000 marchers made it the biggest strike action the state had ever seen. As part of Guardian Australia\u2019s coverage, the federal energy minister, the opposition energy spokesman and two of the country\u2019s biggest energy companies took questions from students. In Vanuatu, the deputy prime minister spoke directly to the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as countries \u201cto blame for this threat to our survival\u201d. Protests in the Solomon Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and many more also continued throughout the day. They\u2019re marching in the Philippines, too. Justin McCurry in Japan writes: Japan has suffered unseasonable, powerful and fatal storms in recent years that have also inflicted serious damage on its infrastructure. Last week\u2019s typhoon was unusually strong, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power. The country has also been hit by record-breaking heatwaves \u2013 one last summer killed 65 people in a single week. Japan\u2019s government had planned to expand nuclear power in an effort to tackle carbon dioxide emissions, but the Fukushima disaster changed all that. Pressure is building to invest more in renewables as the government expands coal-fired power stations and imports of gas and oil to fill the energy gap left by the post-Fukushima closure of dozens of nuclear reactors. Japan\u2019s involvement in the climate strike has been low key. This Friday adults and children belonging to the Fridays for Future Tokyo movement will gather outside the United Nations University in central Tokyo at 5pm, make speeches and then march through the streets of the capital. Just over 100 people turned up in March; students at Japanese state schools were noticeably absent and I think that will be the case this Friday. A few protests have begun in Japan, and one is scheduled for Tokyo at 5pm local time. I cannot stress enough that my favourite thing from today is students on the ground interviewing their fellow strikers. Here is Oscar Lander-McBride, 10, interviewing Zac, 13. And from earlier, Esther Plummer, 13, interviewing Jasper, 15. There are more than 100,000 people in Melbourne, according to organisers. An aerial view of Melbourne, only 30 minutes in. And here\u2019s the march crossing Brisbane\u2019s Victoria bridge: In Bali: In Singapore: And in Brisbane who better to give a crowd estimate than Haemish Lander-McBride, 13, who has been to the past two strikes. \u201cIt\u2019s massive in comparison to the other ones ... People aren\u2019t just going to the first one \u2013 people are really coming again and again and again.\u201d And big crowds in Adelaide: An estimated 10,000 in Perth: Mike Bowers in Canberra: It\u2019s just past 2pm, which is the official start time in Melbourne. But as we saw in Sydney, crowds are so huge there are lines to get in. It\u2019ll take a while to get into full swing. Early crowd numbers out of Sydney: 50,000 to 80,000 people at least. More from First Dog: Over on 2GB in Sydney and 4BC in Brisbane this morning Alan Jones was keeping a sceptical eye on the climate strike. \u201cIf you ask some of these people what it was about they wouldn\u2019t have a clue,\u201d Jones said without actually asking any of the strikers that question. An elderly caller suggested the children\u2019s minds were being manipulated just like those of the Hitler Youth in Germany decades ago. Warming to the theme, Jones had a Goebbels quote on hand: \u201cI will remind our listeners that his minister of propaganda ,Joseph Goebbels, also said it would not be impossible to prove with sufficient repetition and the psychological understanding of the people concerned that a square is in fact a circle. They are mere words and words can be moulded until they clothe ideas in disguise. This is what\u2019s going on here isn\u2019t it? Immensely disturbing I have to say. Immensely disturbing.\u201d Former Queensland Greens senator Andrew Bartlett has this estimate: Similar thoughts in Sydney: The Brisbane rally keeps growing. People are still streaming in 30 minutes after the posted start time and police have had to shut roads on two sides of Queens Park. Hard to guess at a crowd figure, but comfortably over 10,000 at this point. This is not, of course, an anti-government rally, but there\u2019s certainly no love for the coal embrace of the Queensland government. And notably, there are at least a half dozen left-wing unions here. The Electrical Trades Union has just taken a swipe, officials complaining the government has let the private sector do the heavy lifting on renewables, and giving a strong endorsement of climate action. Rebecca Ratcliffe in Delhi writes: Students protesters in India have a long list of demands for their political leaders. The air in many of its cities is infamously toxic, poor waste management is putting lives at risk and water shortages have reached crisis levels. Last year India was ranked among the bottom five countries on the environmental performance index produced by Yale and Columbia universities and the World Economic Forum. \u201cWe are in September now and we would be usually subjected to monsoon rains at this time but the rainfall is so erratic,\u201d said Jacintha Thota, 14, who lives in Hyderabad. On Friday 200 students from her school and some of their teachers are expected to march together. Hyderabad is one of tens of locations, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru, where protests are expected to take place. The Fridays for Future movement is much smaller than other more established environmental campaigns in India, but students say it is growing in popularity, thanks partly to social media. In Delhi protesters are planning seven days of action, which includes marching to the ministry of urban affairs and housing on Friday. On Sunday protesters will meet at Bhalswa landfill, the second biggest dump yard in the city, while next week they will protest at other key political buildings. Bhavreen Kandhari, an environmental activist from Fridays For Future India will take part. \u201cWe have beautiful laws on the paper but none of it is being executed,\u201d she said. Five years ago, when her daughters had an X-ray, she discovered the impact of Delhi\u2019s pollution. \u201cTheir lungs were black in colour; they should be pink. For a child who is born and brought up in Delhi for 10 years this is the damage that they suffer,\u201d she said. Her twin daughters, 15, will also be attending the march in Delhi. \u201cThe rich think \u2018Oh I\u2019ll put a mask on my child\u2019, \u2018I\u2019ll get an air purifier\u2019, and the poorest they can barely make two meals [a day].\u201d Big turnout in Thailand \u2013 and a reminder that many of the protests in Asia will be kicking into gear soon as well. Wait no, maybe this one: Calling the winner now Meanwhile the Brisbane protest has broken its banks and people are streaming down the streets. There\u2019s already a crowd at Treasury Gardens for the Melbourne school strike which kicks off at 2pm. Thea Hamilton, 16, is one of the organisers. \u201cI\u2019m really excited and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to get some really good action out of this and get more people involved in climate action and climate justice,\u201d she says. She says young people \u201care looking for a space to be heard and to really feel represented by this global movement so we can call for climate action at the UN global climate summit on the 23rd\u201d. Continuing our series. EnergyAustralia has agreed to take a question from a climate striker. Along with Queensland\u2019s Stanwell Corporation, it is the other one of Australia\u2019s top 10 carbon emitters to agree to take a question. Josh O\u2019Callaghan, 15, from Adelaide asks: What are the future initiatives that your company plans to put in place to have 100% renewable energy production? Mark Collette, the head of EnergyAustralia\u2019s customer business: Thanks Josh. Designing and building a 100% renewable energy system is a huge challenge for Australia. I think Australians are up for the challenge. Your home state of South Australia has solar and wind already providing over half of the electricity supplied to South Australians. In planning for 100% renewables, the first 50% is easier than the second 50%. Solar and wind generation follow the sun and the wind, so when it is not sunny and windy we can\u2019t produce power for customers. I reckon that above about 50% renewables for Australia we need to find ways to move the power from the sun and the wind to dark and still times, or use it immediately. One way we do this is storage. Already we have two of the largest batteries in the country in Victoria, and we are working on two large pumped hydro projects \u2013 one of which is in your state of South Australia. Another way we are exploring is helping customers use power when it is available from the sun and the wind. We can time pool pumps and hot water systems to run just through these times. There\u2019s a long way to go but we like tackling tough problems, like the second 50%.\u201d In Sydney Daisy, 17, tells the crowd their frustration has never been about people working in the fossil-fuel industry. Their demand is \u201cabout acting to halt this crisis while creating safe and meaningful work for all of us\u201d. And let\u2019s not forget the regions. More photos from Lismore from Frewoini Baume: And these beautiful pictures from Katherine in the NT: And here\u2019s Albury: The crowd in Sydney is getting so big you can really only see it from the air. Perth and Canberra aren\u2019t too shabby either: This is the third nationwide climate strike in Australia \u2013 after November 2018 and March 2019. They get bigger every time. Amelia Neylon, 16, is on the ground and tells Guardian Australia: The crowd is reportedly over 22,000. Bob Brown at this count has said it is larger then the Franklin River rally. Making this the largest rally in Tasmania held to date. It\u2019s all happening. Another must-watch, exclusive to Guardian Australia: Meanwhile Australia\u2019s strikes are making waves around the world: If you are Gen X or above, then you can laugh at the latest from First Dog on the Moon instead*: *This is a joke \u2013 First Dog is funny for all ages. I\u2019m a millennial / Gen Z so I understand these signs. If you don\u2019t, rest assured they are very funny. In Brisbane, here\u2019s Parker with his message to the government \u2013 and a great poem. The award for best sign is getting more competitive every minute. Here is Matilda (3). Sydney\u2019s strikes have started but aren\u2019t even at full swing, Melbourne\u2019s starts in 1.5 hours, and preparations have begun in Perth. Earlier today we saw huge turnouts in regional areas, including Alice Springs and Byron Bay. Angus Taylor has also agreed to take a question. From Josh O\u2019Callaghan, 15, from Adelaide: It is said that \u2018if those who believe in climate change are wrong, we will have needlessly created a cleaner world, but if those who don\u2019t believe in climate change are wrong, we will die\u2019. Do you agree? If so, how should we act on this? Angus Taylor : The federal government is taking strong action to reduce global emissions and respond to the serious challenge of climate change. The government\u2019s $3.5bn climate solutions package sets out how we will meet our 2030 Paris target, down to the last tonne. People are free to have their views, but my personal opinion is that students should be at school during school hours.\u201d Reporter Helen Davidson is on the ground in Sydney: Our first dispatches from Amelia Neylon in Hobart: Meanwhile crowds build in Sydney. There is a LONG line to get in. Esther in Byron Bay has interviewed her fellow strikers. Must-watch. First images in from Hobart: Sydney\u2019s strike is scheduled to start at noon. Huge crowds are still making their way to the city. This could take some time and is looking immense. Some footage from Thailand: Continuing our Q&amp;A series is Labor\u2019s spokesman on climate change and energy, Mark Butler. Frewoini Baume, 18, from Lismore asks: Permanent destruction for temporary economic gain is not a sustainable or stable economy. Why are you supporting the coal industry when it has been scientifically proven to be unsustainable? Yes, the economy may temporarily suffer but the longer you wait the more severe the impact. So why not act now? Mark Butler: The Labor party remains deeply committed to taking climate action to make sure that we comply with the commitments to future generations in the Paris agreement \u2013 to keep global warming way below 2 degrees and to pursue efforts around 1.5 degrees to make sure that we are at net zero emissions by the middle of the century. There is no denying that Australia needs to drastically reduce its carbon emissions, but after coming down by more than 10% when Labor was last in office, emissions have been rising ever since the election of Tony Abbott, and the government\u2019s own data shows they will keep rising all the way to 2030. Australia doesn\u2019t have a national climate policy. That is why we need to keep pressuring the Liberal government to take serious climate action.\u201d Some more charts, this time Australia-specific from our data editor, Nick Evershed: This first shows warming in Australia, measuring how different the temperature is in a given year against the long-term average. Put simply, it demonstrates how things are getting hotter, and 2018 was the third-hottest year: This second shows Australia\u2019s quarterly emissions over time. The bars need to be under the two lines (assuming a linear rate of reduction to meet the target) if we are going to meet various emissions targets. The pink line shows the trajectory to a 28% reduction in emissions, based on 2005 levels, by 2030. This is the more ambitious of Australia\u2019s possible reduction targets under the Paris agreement. The purple line is the trajectory proposed by the Climate Change Authority based on the best available science to ensure Australia makes a meaningful contribution towards keeping global temperature increases under 2C. Ideally the bars should be below both lines. And some early data from Twitter: #ClimateStrike is trending #1 in Australia and has been for the past two hours #schoolstrike4climate is at #2 and #friday4future is at #5 Australian cities where #climatestrike is trending: Adelaide #2 Darwin #1 Melbourne #1 Perth #1 Sydney #1 An on-the-ground sketch from First Dog on the Moon You may have noticed the arresting temperature chart at the top of our site this morning \u2013 I know I did. Our colleagues internationally have also compiled more charts that explain the climate crisis. And some slightly better news: In Lismore Frewoini Baume has interviewed Suhani Sheppeard, 16. FB: \u201cWhy are you striking?\u201d SS: \u201cI\u2019m striking because I believe it takes one person to change the world. Having that opportunity to be that person is incredibly inspiring and I want to be the one voice to inspire others. \u201cIt feels incredibly empowering to be a part of the community in our global strike, and inspires me to always fight for climate justice.\u201d Jotham Napat, Vanuatu\u2019s deputy prime minister, delivered his speech in English \u201cbecause the people who need to hear this, the ones who are causing the problems, are not here\u201d. According to the Vanuatu Posts\u2019 Dan McGarry, Napat named the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as the ones who are \u201cto blame for this threat to our survival\u201d. Earlier Vanuatu\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Ralph Regenvanu, also spoke and criticised Australia. He characterised the discussions at the recent Pacific Islands forum in Tuvalu as a \u201cfight\u201d between Australia and the rest of the Pacific. Regenvanu, an outspoken Pacific leader, has also promised to take his country\u2019s climate grievance to the International Court of Justice to seek legal redress. During the Pacific Islands forum Regenvanu told the Guardian that critical talks almost collapsed twice amid \u201cfierce\u201d clashes between Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and other Pacific leaders. \u201cAustralia is out there \u2013 they\u2019re not with us,\u201d Regenvanu said at the time. Today students in Vanuatu partnered with the Vanuatu climate action network to stage a silent strike. Students wearing traditional dress and holding banners with messages about the climate crisis stood around the capital, Port Vila, as politicians walked around the city viewing the messages, finishing up at the seafront of the city where there were art exhibitions, poetry performances and speeches. In Albury the march will head to the office of the environment minister, Sussan Ley. Our first Q&amp;A is in. The Stanwell Corporation is one of Australia\u2019s biggest energy companies. EnergyAustralia and Stanwell were the only members of Australia\u2019s top 10 carbon emitters who agreed to take a question for our live blog today. Narii Hamill-Salmon, 15, from the Gold Coast asks: The Stanwell Corporation was named as the nation\u2019s third largest carbon emitter in 2017-18 [by the Clean Energy Regulator] thus making the company a significant contributor to the climate crisis. Mr Van Breda, if you could say one thing to the future generations of this planet, the ones who are going to experience the most devastating impacts of climate change, what would you tell them?\u201d Richard Van Breda, chief executive: Thanks for your question, Narii. I think a lot about that, and here\u2019s what I would tell future generations about the work we do at Stanwell. The electricity industry is at a tricky time in its transition to lower carbon technologies. The proportion of low carbon energy and storage in Australia is increasing quickly, but those technologies are not yet at a point where they can function without support from fossil fuel generation. As a company that operates coal-fired power stations, it\u2019s Stanwell\u2019s job to provide the electricity that people need, as the industry moves to a lower carbon future. That change can\u2019t happen immediately and needs to be planned and done carefully. We ramp generation from our coal-fired power stations up and down every day to support solar generation in the middle of the day, and still provide the electricity people need in the evenings. We are also exploring new generation and storage technology that will help reduce emissions. I\u2019m really proud of the work Stanwell people are doing in all those areas.\u201d And Frewoini Baume, 18, has sent through the first few images of the Lismore strikes. If people want a last minute sign for the climate strike First Dog on the Moon says you can print this out on vegan paper and wave it about. More dispatches from Esther in Byron: There are big contingents and great photos coming in from all across the Pacific \u2013 especially Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands right now. And in Castlemaine, Victoria, where this all began (in Australia at least), there are no signs of slowing. Early signs from University of Sydney: And nearby, stores all along King Street have closed for the day in solidarity. In Gloucester New South Wales we have an early contender for best costume today (the sunflower). In a landmark decision earlier this year, a court blocked a new coalmine in the region because of the \u201cdire consequences\u201d of increasing emissions. Absolutely huge turnout in Geelong where they\u2019re singing and chanting. And more from Townsville: It\u2019s not even 11am yet on the east coast and it\u2019s already obvious today\u2019s protests are going to be bigger than ever before. First Barnesy now The Oils: In Vanuatu: The Knitting Nannas are already down in Lismore. Our first student on the ground Esther Plummer (13) has sent pictures from Byron Bay. Earlier we said 1,000 businesses are supporting the strike. That number is now 2,600, with the latest figures from Not Business As Usual. And here is music legend (and all-round legend) Jimmy Barnes, with his message of support to the strikers. In New Caledonia: Big turnout in Townsville. The event there started at 9am and they will be marching at 10am. Protesters are staging a die-in in the centre of Alice Springs. Traditional owners have stressed the importance of putting Indigenous perspectives at the centre of these protests. Yesterday Sammy Wilson, a custodian of Uluru and chair of the Central Land Council, announced that the council will join the strike across the Northern Territory. \u201cAboriginal people want to be part of the solution,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to have access to clean technologies such as solar power so that our children have the chance to keep living on our traditional country. \u201cI support their right to take this action [and] I call on them to spare a thought for Aboriginal people out bush who may not be able to travel to the strikes but who are already suffering most during our hotter, longer and drier summers.\u201d After the NT\u2019s hottest summer on record, delegates at the council meeting last month said climate change and water security were their top policy priorities. Kate Lamb in Jakarta writes: In Indonesia the climate strikes come as the country faces an escalating environmental emergency \u2013 tens of thousands of hectares of rainforest are burning in Sumatra and Kalimantan, home to some of the largest swathes of virgin forest in the world. This year the annual fires \u2013 a result of \u201cslash and burn\u201d practices to clear land mostly for palm oil plantations \u2013 have been exacerbated by the El Nino phenomenon and severe droughts. Thick haze has blanketed cities in Indonesia and neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia, and also forced schools to be closed and increased the risk of respiratory-related illnesses. Also on the minds of young Indonesian activists is how to curb the country\u2019s plastic addiction. Home to more than 250 million people, Indonesia is the second largest contributor to ocean plastics after China. But in recent years environmental awareness around plastics has gained momentum, largely driven by inspiring Indonesian students, artists, musicians and activists. On Friday hundreds are expected to take to the streets of Jakarta and 12 cities across the archipelago, on the islands of Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan and Bali. Expect colourful costumes, live performances from local indie bands, and talk of an \u201cenergy revolution\u201d. From here in the steamy tropics, the focus of that discussion will be on the future of solar energy. More from the Pacific from Kate Lyons Climate strike events kicked off in Tonga yesterday (which held its main event \u2013 a community clean-up on Thursday because of the significant number of Seventh Day Adventists in the country who observe the Sabbath on Fridays). Pacific countries, many of which are bearing the brunt of the effects of the climate crisis, are holding events today, though most are not holding strikes or traditional protests, instead focusing on community events such as clean-ups, barbecues and poetry performances. Things are already well under way in Alice Springs. Up to 60 local businesses have also shut their doors for today. Meanwhile preparations continue around the country. Eleanor Ainge Roy writes from Dunedin New Zealand is pushing back its participation in the strikes to Friday 27 September so high school students can sit national exams this week. Large strikes are planned nationwide. Sea level rise is a real and increasingly urgent threat to New Zealand. Most of New Zealand\u2019s nearly 5 million people live on the coast. Sea walls to protect vulnerable communities are being constructed \u2013 from the former gold-mining town of Hokitika on the west coast to vulnerable beachside huts in the isolated far north. Sea level rise is also a pressing issue for the country\u2019s Indigenous people, with their tribal marae [meeting houses] mostly on low-lying coastal land. Jacinda Ardern\u2019s Labour coalition government has vowed to tackle climate change head on, committing to making the country carbon neutral by 2050 and planting 1bn trees. The first climate strike in New Zealand was interrupted by the Christchurch mosque attacks, with children in central Christchurch shepherded into lockdown for hours. It was initially thought, incorrectly, that the striking children may have been a target. Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s policy manager, Annaliese Johnston, says New Zealand youth climate groups have been instrumental in increasing awareness in the Pacific region. \u201cThe youth of today in New Zealand ... have woken us all up to the urgent call to action to protect our common home and future.\u201d Greta Thunberg, the 16-year old Swedish student who inspired this movement, has recorded a short film for today\u2019s strike. In it, she and Guardian columnist George Monbiot talk about the importance of natural solutions \u2013 low-cost, effective initiatives such as rowing trees. And for a bit of a blast from the past you can read Thunberg\u2019s opinion piece from November 2018 \u2013 written specifically for Australia \u2013 when we became one of the first countries to hold nationwide student strikes. \u201cIn the Pacific we don\u2019t go on strike, but we do other things,\u201d says Patricia Mallam, a Fijian climate activist from 350.org. Over the course of the day children and students from Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Tonga, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea will take part in poetry performances, silent protests, sporting events, barbecues and intergenerational discussions about the effects of climate change in the region. These events rather than traditional protests and street marches make more sense for the Pacific, says Mallam, because it is such a community-driven region \u201cand we all know that the problem is not within the community\u201d. \u201cFor instance, you don\u2019t have any coalmines in the Pacific, so we can\u2019t have people striking outside coalmines. The problems are not being caused here. But in countries where there are coalmines or banks financing the fossil-fuel industry, it makes sense for people to go on strike, so they\u2019re voicing their distaste for what\u2019s going on to keep their economies afloat,\u201d she says over the phone from Fiji. \u201cWe all know that the problem is not being caused here in the Pacific, but we\u2019re facing the full brunt of the climate crisis.\u201d The Pacific is estimated to contribute just 0.03% of global emissions despite making up 0.12% of the world\u2019s population, but is at the frontline of the climate emergency, with countries facing rising sea levels, coastal erosion, the destruction of crucial reefs, inundations and warming seas that lead to more frequent and more severe cyclones. \u201cIt is a day, especially for the polluters, they need to quickly understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Mallam. \u201cBut at the same time, in the Pacific we feel that because we\u2019re at the frontline of the impacts, it\u2019s important for us to speak up and have other nations hear what\u2019s happening.\u201d Preparations are under way in the Solomon Islands already. And Kate Lyons spoke to some of the activists across the Pacific ahead of today\u2019s big day. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about today\u2019s strikes as collated by my colleague Lisa Cox. There are more than 100 locations, and the strikes have support from 30 unions, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and more than 1,000 businesses including Atlassian, Future Super and KeepCup. And in news from this morning, more than 250 academics have also signed on in support. Morning everyone. Today the global climate strikes start in Australia and the Pacific. The Guardian Australia team will follow it all. We have a huge day of coverage planned. The Australian strikes will be in full swing from 11am or noon (local time) and before that in New Zealand and the Pacific. Our correspondents are standing by, and cartoonist First Dog on the Moon is on duty \u2013 they\u2019ll be sketching throughout the day. And because today is really about the students, we\u2019ve organised to receive on-the-ground updates from participants. Here they are in a (non-exhaustive) list: Narii-Hamill Salmon, 15, Gold Coast Qld Frewoini Baume, 18, Lismore NSW Josh O\u2019Callaghan, 15, Adelaide SA Amelia Neylon, 16, Hobart Tas Esther Plummer, 13, Byron Bay NSW Iestyn (13) and Owynn (11) Harries, Brisbane Qld Dakota Barret-Perry, 15, Melbourne Vic They have also been given the opportunity to ask a question directly of federal politicians and prominent business leaders \u2013 from the energy minister to EnergyAustralia. We\u2019ll publish the questions and their answers throughout the day. Stay with us. For the next 24 hours, the Guardian will be reporting in real time on the wave of climate strikes as they ripple around the world, starting in the Asia-Pacific region and continuing through Europe and Africa before culminating in the Americas. Millions of young people are expected to turn out in more than 3,000 events worldwide in this latest edition of the Fridays For Future strikes. On this occasion, adults have been invited to join in and companies, organisations, trade unions, even churches are expected to join the fray. Our correspondents on the ground will be feeding in with live updates from the world\u2019s major metropolises, and we\u2019ll be pausing for breath every now and then to consider the bigger picture, the state we\u2019re in, the scale of the challenge. The strike kicks off a big week for environmental activism with a major climate action summit at the UN next week and another round of Friday strikes on the 27th. The Guardian will be at these events too.",

The LGBTQ 2020 forum in Iowa is starting now, featuring Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Joe Sestak, Elizabeth Warren and Marianne Williamson. Watch live here: Some links and news from the day: Trump on Friday denied an accusation from his political rival Hillary Clinton that he sought help from a foreign government to help his bid for re-election. Numerous reports suggested Trump pressed the leader of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son. The calls for impeachment escalated in the wake of the Ukraine reports. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the first time has added white supremacist violence to its list of major national security threats. Democrats are calling on Housing and Urban Development (HUD) secretary Ben Carson to resign one day after reports that he made transphobic comments in San Francisco. US defense secretary Mark Esper announced that US air forces would be sent to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, calling them \u201cdefensive in nature\u201d. California and 23 other states have filed a lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from blocking California\u2019s authority to set emission standards for cars and trucks. Trump is set to attend the United Nations headquarters during Monday\u2019s key summit on the climate crisis \u2013 but will be there to take part in a meeting on religious freedom instead. Some Democrats are calling on Housing and Urban Development (HUD) secretary Ben Carson to resign one day after reports that he made transphobic comments in San Francisco. The Washington Post reported Thursday that in front of dozens of HUD staffers in California, Carson expressed concerns about \u201cbig, hairy men\u201d trying to infiltrate women\u2019s homeless shelters and lamented that society no longer seemed to know the difference between men and women. Trans rights groups noted he was using a \u201cheinous insult\u201d to attack trans women, and that Carson has a history of anti-trans remarks and policy efforts: Some of the calls for resignation: Carson wrote a note to staff addressing the controversy on Friday night, according to the Post\u2019s latest story. In it, he defended his remarks and repeated the transphobic argument that he was concerned about situations when \u201cmen would claim to be women\u201d. Trans people face disproportionately high levels of violence and discrimination in housing and other areas. More here on the Trump administration\u2019s escalating attacks on LGBTQ rights: At least a dozen Iranian students scheduled to begin engineering and computer science graduate programs had their visas abruptly canceled and were barred from their flights to the US this month, according to a new New York Times report: The State Department told the New York Times there was no change in policy. Most of the students were planning to go to University of California schools. Also from today, a Democracy Now segment on youth climate activist Nasratullah Elham ,of Afghanistan, who was invited to a UN summit, but could not come after the but the US rejected his visa: Meanwhile, at Trump\u2019s Australia State dinner, Rudy Guiliani apparently laughed off questions about his testy and bizarre interview with CNN last night... US defense secretary Mark Esper just announced that US air forces would be sent to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, calling them \u201cdefensive in nature\u201d: From the AP: The Pentagon says the US will deploy additional troops and military equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to beef up security, as Trump has at least for now decided against any immediate military strike on Iran in response to the attack on the Saudi oil industry. Defense secretary Mark Esper says this is a first step, and he is not ruling out additional moves down the road. He says it\u2019s a response to requests from the Saudis and the UAE to help improve their air and missile defenses. Esper and Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, say details of the deployments will be determined over the coming days. Joe Biden has released a statement following reports that Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the former vice president\u2019s son, saying, \u201cThis behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes.\u201d Full statement here: The 2020 Democratic candidate said \u201cat minimum\u201d, Trump should release the transcript of his call with Ukraine\u2019s president: California\u2019s legal action against the Trump administration over vehicle emissions standards marks the 60th time the state has sued the administration, the Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho notes: More background from Vivian: The state has battled Trump on a number of different issues, on everything from immigration to the state\u2019s high-speed rail project. Trump, who rarely visits the state, was in California this week, when he claimed that the EPA was issuing San Francisco an environmental violation notice for its homeless population polluting the ocean with hypodermic needles and waste through the sewer system \u2013 an allegation that city officials said was false. More on Trump\u2019s California attacks this week: Impeachment calls are ramping up again amid the widening scandal surrounding Trump\u2019s alleged effort to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son. A sample: The Washington Post is now also confirming earlier reports that Trump pressed the leader of Ukraine to investigate Biden\u2019s son: White House counsel Pat Cipollone has also \u201cbeen engaged in the matter since shortly after the whistleblower action surfaced\u201d, according to the Post\u2019s report, which said he identified \u201clegal obstacles to the sharing of information that could be politically damaging to Trump\u201d. A senior administration official told the paper: \u201cAt no time has Pat Cipollone personally directed the [director of national intelligence] to withhold information from Congress.\u201d Sam Levin here, taking over our live coverage on this busy Friday afternoon. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the first time has added white supremacist violence to its list of major national security threats, officials revealed today while unveiling details of its new counterterrorism strategy. Kevin McAleenan, acting homeland secretary, said in a speech earlier: The continuing menace of racially based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to our nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population, and the core values of both our society and our department.\u201d This is a move that experts on far-right threats and domestic terrorism say is long overdue. More than 175 people were killed worldwide in the last eight years in attacks linked to white nationalists, according to a recent Guardian analysis, which looked at 16 high-profile attacks motivated by white nationalist conspiracy theories. Concerns about the US government\u2019s failure to take rightwing violence seriously escalated after a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas last month in an attack against Latinos. A former intelligence officer recently talked to the Guardian about the backlash he faced internally after issuing a briefing on rightwing extremism a decade earlier. More details on today\u2019s development here: And a recent overview from the Guardian on the growing white supremacist threats: \u2022Donald Trump pressed the president of the Ukraine eight times to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The president reportedly told President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he should work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer, on investigating Biden. \u2022That revelation came after Trump had dismissed reports that a whistleblower had raised the alarm over Trump\u2019s conversations with a foreign leader. Throughout Friday Trump insisted there was \u201cnothing said wrong\u201d during his phone conversations. Trump said the whistleblower was \u201cpartisan\u201d, before confessing he did not actually know who the whistleblower is. \u2022Even before the WSJ\u2019s reporting, Nancy Pelosi warned the whistleblower\u2019s complaint raised \u2018grave, urgent concerns for our national security\u2019. We will continue to follow the facts and explore every possible option to ensure the American people get the truth,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. We would hope that Republicans would join us in supporting the constitution.\u201d Not much reaction from Democrats (or Republicans) yet to the latest Trump-whistleblower revelations. Sen Chris Murphy, a Democrat, is one of the few to comment so far: No word from Trump yet regarding these new whistleblower revelations. Although, four minutes after the Wall Street Journal dropped its story, the president did tweet out this video of him enjoying himself with the Australian prime minister. Some Democrats seem to think Trump asking the president of Ukraine eight times to investigate his main 2020 rival\u2019s son is the final straw. Well, one Democrat. (But bear in mind the Wall Street Journal only published that story thirty minutes ago.) During a July phone call Donald Trump repeatedly pressured the president of the Ukraine to investigated Joe Biden\u2019s son, the Wall Street Journal reports. According to the Journal, Trump asked Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u201cabout eight times\u201d to work with Rudy Giuliani on an investigation into Hunter Biden. From the Journal: \u201c[Trump] told [Zelenzky] that he should work with [Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know,\u201d whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said. Trump didn\u2019t mention a provision of foreign aid to Ukraine on the call, said this person, who didn\u2019t believe Trump offered the Ukrainian president any quid-pro-quo for his cooperation on an investigation. Earlier today Trump said his conversation with the Ukraine president was \u201ctotally appropriate\u201d. Trump also said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed\u201d in the call. He did, however, tell journalists: \u201cSomeone ought to look into Joe Biden.\u201d Who among us hasn\u2019t attempted to hide in an elevator when confronted about our support for a bigot? A woman who is suing Customs and Border Patrol after a federal agent questioned her and a friend for speaking Spanish in a convenience store says the backlash has forced them to leave their small Montana home town. Ana Suda said today she has been harassed by other residents of Havre, a remote town in northern Montana, in stores and restaurants ever since a video of a Border Patrol agent questioning her and Martha \u201cMimi\u201d Hernandez was uploaded to YouTube. One version has been viewed more than 123,000 times since February, the Associated Press writes. Suda is now living in El Paso, Texas, on the US-Mexico border. Attorney Alex Rate says Hernandez is living in the much larger town of Great Falls and commutes to Havre. The US citizens are asking a judge to block the federal agency from detaining anyone based on race, accent or language alone. Border patrol officials and the US attorney\u2019s office declined comment. The women were given an award by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in the summer, given annually to chosen Montanans who are fighting for \u201cracial justice and educational equity,\u201d according to the ACLU of Montana. \u201cReports of a reliable whistleblower complaint regarding the President\u2019s communications with a foreign leader raise grave, urgent concerns for our national security,\u201d Nancy Pelosi said in a statement this afternoon. \u201cWe must be sure that the President and his Administration are conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President\u2019s personal interest. [...] We will continue to follow the facts and explore every possible option to ensure the American people get the truth. We would hope that Republicans would join us in supporting the Constitution.\u201d Walmart will stop selling all e-cigarettes, the company said on Friday. \u201cGiven the growing federal, state and local regulatory complexity and uncertainty regarding e-cigarettes, we plan to discontinue the sale of electronic nicotine delivery products at all Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club U.S. locations,\u201d Walmart said. \u201cWe will complete our exit after selling through current inventory.\u201d CNBC was the first to report on Walmart\u2019s move, which comes as the government moved to ban most flavored e-cigarettes. There have now been eight deaths connected to vaping in the US, and more than 500 cases of lung problems. In about 80% of those cases individuals said they were using liquids that THC. The Trump administration is planning to sign an agreement to help make one of Central America\u2019s most violent countries, El Salvador, a haven for migrants seeking asylum, Associated Press is reporting: The agreement could lead to migrants from third countries obtaining refuge in El Salvador even though many Salvadorans are fleeing their nation and seeking asylum in the United States. A Salvadoran delegation has been in the U.S. this week discussing the matter. [...] It\u2019s the latest effort by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to force asylum-seekers in Central America to seek refuge outside the United States. Immigration officials also are forcing more than 42,000 people to remain in Mexico as their cases play out and have changed policy to deny asylum to anyone who transited through a third country en route to the southern border of the US. California and 23 other states are suing to stop the Trump administration from revoking the state\u2019s authority to set auto emission standards, Associated Press is reporting. On Thursday the White House formally moved to revoke California\u2019s ability to set its own vehicle emissions standards. In that announcement the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said the government\u2019s decision would ensure \u201cmuch-needed regulatory certainty for the automotive industry\u201d and \u201cpromote economic growth by reducing the price of new vehicles to help more Americans purchase newer, cleaner, and safer cars and trucks\u201d. California governor Gavin Newsom had threatened to sue ahead of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement. The full list of those states, as per New York attorney general Letitia James: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia; as well as the cities of Los Angeles and New York. Top Democrats are calling for the government to release information on the whistleblower complaint regarding a Trump conversation with a foreign leader. Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, told reporters on Friday that he intended to get to the bottom of the complaint \u201ccome hell or high water\u201d. Schiff said the seriousness of the complaint, which the director of national intelligence is refusing to release to Congress, should not be underestimated. This involves something more sinister, something involving a serious or flagrant abuse or violation of law or misappropriation, and the IG underscored the seriousness of this, and also that this needs to be looked into. And right now, no one is looking into this. Earlier Nancy Pelosi called on the director of national intelligence to \u201cuphold the law\u201d, during an interview with CNN. \u201cWell, the law says that the DNI should send the information, shall, not should, shall send that information to Congress,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cSo the law is the law. So, we just have to uphold the law.\u201d Donald Trump is now giving a press conference with Australian prime minister Scott Morrison. Asked about the likelihood of a trade deal with China, Trump says it probably won\u2019t be done before November 2020. We\u2019re pausing our live politics blog now for the US portion of the global climate strike \u2013 back at 12.30pm ET. You can follow our coverage of the strike here: Trump\u2019s informal press conference at the White House is continuing. Trump says he has shown restraint over Iran. He says \u201cthe easiest thing to do\u201d would be to order a military strike on the country, but warns he could \u201cdo it right here in front of [the assembled media]\u201d. \u201c[I could] knock out 15 different major things in Iran,\u201d Trump says. \u201cI could do that and [...] it\u2019s all set to go.\u201d Trump adds: \u201cIt would take place in one minute. I could do it right here in front of you. [...] I think it shows much more strength to do it the way we\u2019re doing it.\u201d Trump is scheduled to hold a press conference at 11.45am, but he\u2019s currently doing his freeform thing from a chair next to the Australian prime minister. The president is asked if he has read the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. \u201cNo,\u201d Trump says. Despite not having read it, Trump says of the complaint: \u201cIt\u2019s another media disaster.\u201d \u201cYou have been wrong on so many things,\u201d he tells the assembled journalists. Some other lines from this chat: asked about the nationality of astronauts that might be sent into space in the future, Trump said he personally would not like to go into space. Trump praised Australia\u2019s mineral mining industry, and said the country had eradicated \u201cblack lung\u201d. Typically confusing, and contradictory, statements from Trump just now. Trump referred to the whistleblower controversy a \u201cridiculous story\u201d. And then: asked whether Trump discussed Joe Biden in conversations with Ukraine, Trump said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed\u201d. He added: \u201cSomeone ought to look into Joe Biden.\u201d Trump also said the whistleblower was \u201cpartisan\u201d, before telling the White House reporter he did not know who the whistleblower is. News from the Oval Office, where Trump has announced new sanctions on the Iranian national bank: According to a White House pool report, Trump said the sanctions are: \u201c[The] highest sanctions ever imposed on a country.\u201d The sanctiond go \u201cright to the top\u201d, Trump added. Donald Trump is welcoming Australian prime minister Scott Morrison to the White House today. Morrison will be afforded a full state visit, according to the New York Times \u2013 becoming only the second foreign leader to receive such a welcome. (French president Emmanuel Macron was the other.) Keen Trump followers will remember that the transcript of a rambling, confused phone call Trump had with former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull was leaked in 2017. The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger wrote at the time that the transcript exposed Trump\u2019s \u201cill-informed narcissism\u201d. Trump and Morrison are holding a joint press conference at 11.45am. It\u2019s very likely that Trump will be asked about Ukraine and whistleblowing. In a boost for the president, but a blow to anyone who is opposed to a president (allegedly) using the office to enrich himself, a US Marine Corps unit in South Florida is planning to hold its annual ball at ... Mar-a-Lago. The Miami Herald reports that a Marine reserve unit stationed in South Florida plans to celebrate the 244th anniversary of the Marines\u2019 founding at Trump\u2019s Palm Beach club on November 16. \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d a Marine told tje Herald on Thursday. We are planning on Mar-a-Lago but nothing is set in stone. We booked it but there were complications involved. ... It\u2019s just money and some other things. We\u2019re doing our best. In other news we\u2019re following today: Bill de Blasio \u2013 brace yourself \u2013 has ended his campaign for president. In an op-ed published by NBC News, de Blasio said: \u201cI have reached the point where I feel I have contributed all I can to this Democratic primary.\u201d Interviewed by MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, de Blasio added: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not my time, so I\u2019m going to end my presidential campaign.\u201d de Blasio has been polling at roughly zero percent of the vote for weeks. Housing and urban development secretary Ben Carson is under fire after reportedly making transphobic comments. According to the Washington Post: \u201cCarson expressed concern about \u2018big, hairy men\u2019 trying to infiltrate women\u2019s homeless shelters during an internal meeting.\u201d Transgender people seem to be of particular interest to Carson. During his aborted 2016 presidential campaign he said trans people were \u201cabnormal\u201d. Hi, welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the day\u2019s political news. The whistleblower row over Donald Trump\u2019s alleged \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign leader is now focussed on the president\u2019s conversations with Ukraine, according to reports from Washington DC, as the president was forced to defend himself on Friday against accusations of impropriety. Both the Washington Post and the New York Times reported on Thursday night that Ukraine was the subject of the unnamed whistleblower\u2019s alarm. Trump\u2019s conversation with a foreign leader had so troubled an intelligence official that they reported it. The White House is yet to pass the details of the complaint to Congress. On Thursday night Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s attorney, admitted that he had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. On CNN Giuliani said: \u201cOf course I did,\u201d when asked whether he had pressed Ukraine to look into Biden. The business dealings of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, in the country, have become a focus for Republicans. Some of the GOP have suggested there was impropriety in an investigation in Biden Jr, which was dropped. Trump defended himself against any accusations on Friday morning, tweeting that there was \u201cnothing said wrong\u201d during his conversation with (an unnamed) foreign leader, describing it as \u201cpitch perfect\u201d.",
