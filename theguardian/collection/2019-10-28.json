Gavin Newsom, the California governor, declared a state of emergency on 27 October, as crews worked to control several large blazes, including the Tick fire in the Santa Clarita Valley and a brush fire near the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The largest of the fires, the Kincade fire in Sonoma county, forced almost 200,000 people to evacuate. Meanwhile, millions of people across California are without power, as utilities blacked out entire swathes of the state in an effort to prevent more blazes. Extreme weather has contributed to the wildfires\u2019 intensity. The past weekend saw a \u201chistoric\u201d wind event in the northern San Francisco Bay Area with gusts of nearly 100mph. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the business 30 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Steve Anderson, a forecaster in the San Francisco office of the National Weather Service. Here\u2019s what else you need to know about the crisis: Is this normal, or is it global heating? Wildfires are part of life in California and a natural part of the ecosystem, and autumn is the traditional high-risk season for fires to break out. However, experts broadly agree that the climate crisis is making the conditions for wildfires worse, and extending the season for longer. Since 1970, temperatures in the western US have increased by about double the global average, lengthening the western wildfire season by several months and drying out large tracts of forests, making them more fire-prone. \u201cClimate change is increasing the vulnerability of many forests to ecosystem changes and tree mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought and disease outbreaks,\u201d a major climate assessment by the US government states. Cal Fire, the state\u2019s wildfire disaster agency, says that \u201cwhile wildfires are a natural part of California\u2019s landscape, the fire season in California and across the west is starting earlier and ending later each year. Climate change is considered a key driver of this trend.\u201d Prominent figures, including the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the environmental scholar Bill McKibben, have called the fires an urgent reminder that we need to cut carbon emissions drastically or face irreversible climate breakdown. Why are there power outages? California\u2019s power companies fear that their equipment may start new fires amid high-risk weather conditions, including the fierce winds the state saw in past days. Rather than risk trees toppling power lines or other equipment malfunctioning, Pacific Gas &amp; Electricity and Southern California Edison have preventively cut off power to more than a million customers, sometimes for days on end. PG&amp;E, California\u2019s largest utility company, filed for bankruptcy in January as a result of numerous litigation over its role in the 2017 northern California fires and the 2018 Camp fire, the deadliest in state history. The current power shutoff is not the first this year, but it is the largest so far and unprecedented in the state\u2019s history. Authorities have not yet confirmed what sparked the Kincade fire, but PG&amp;E said a 230,000-volt transmission line near the wine-country town of Geyserville malfunctioned minutes before that blaze erupted on Wednesday night. What\u2019s going on with the wind? Strong fall winds are typical in California, so typical in fact that local residents refer to them by proper names \u2013 \u201cthe Diablos\u201d in the north and \u201cthe Santa Anas\u201d in the south. The winds are caused when high-pressure air inland warms, dries and picks up speed as it travels down the Sierra Nevada mountains toward the Pacific coast. This year\u2019s record heat in Alaska, as well as unseasonable cold in other western US states, have made that wind pattern even more extreme than usual. How do these fires compare to previous years? The 2017 and 2018 were the two deadliest wildfire years on record. The Kincade fire is still only a fraction of the size of the 2017 northern California fires, which killed 44, and there have been no fatalities linked to the fires yet. But in a state still reeling from the aftermath of the 2017 fires, as well as the 2018 Camp fire in Paradise, which left 86 dead, the shadow of previous disasters is looming large. Rebuilding in places like Paradise has only begun, while some people have only recently returned home now face having to leave again. And from northern California to Los Angeles, residents are grappling with the sinking sense of that their state has become unlivable amid a \u201cnew normal\u201d of debilitating heat, an endless fire season, mandatory mass evacuations and forced power shutdowns to prevent new blazes.",

It has also said its transmission lines may have been responsible for the Kincade fire.</p> \n<p>The utility has been roundly criticized for its handling of the blackouts, the first of which came early in October.

      "bodyText": "California firefighters raced against time on Monday to bring a raging wine country wildfire under control amid a lull in the weather, with warnings that the extreme winds fueling fires across the state could pick up again soon. Violent winds of up to 100mph helped the Kincade fire, currently the largest burning in the state, to double in size over the weekend. The fire has scorched nearly 75,000 acres, destroyed more than 120 structures, and forced an unprecedented evacuation of more than 185,000 people in the area. In the south of the state, a blaze broke out in the early morning near the Getty art museum in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, hailed \u201ca lot of amazing heroes\u201d while warning residents to heed evacuation warnings. \u201cIf you have an evacuation notice and you are still in your home, leave. We have seen tragedies before ... get your loved ones and your pets and go,\u201d he said. No deaths from either blaze were reported, but a firefighter was seriously injured in the wine country fire in Sonoma county. The winds wound down Monday morning but forecasters predicted the respite would be brief. The Weather Channel reported that the state would see a third round of fire danger on Tuesday and southern California could see its highest winds yet. Meanwhile, more than 2 million people remained without electricity, after the state\u2019s largest utility company, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, shut off power over the weekend to prevent its equipment from sparking blazes. PG&amp;E said it was slowly restoring power to customers, but it warned that more deliberate blackouts were possible in the coming days because of the new round of high winds in the forecast. Roughly 741,000 homes or businesses were still without power on Monday afternoon, according to the company. In Los Angeles, the Getty fire broke out at 1.34am local time near the museum and the 405 Freeway, in dry brush. The Getty Center said its museum grounds remained safe as of Monday morning, with the fire burning to the north and west of the property. The art was also protected by \u201cstate-of-the-art technology\u201d, the center said, adding, \u201cThe safest place for the art and library collections is inside.\u201d The Getty fire forced the evacuation of the NBA star LeBron James and the former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, with the Terminator star tweeting that his neighbors should flee when ordered: \u201cIf you are in an evacuation zone, don\u2019t screw around. Get out.\u201d The flames also threatened Mount St Mary\u2019s University, a local college, and a spokeswoman said all 450 students were evacuated to the university\u2019s campus near downtown. The region is no stranger to destructive fires. In 2017, the Skirball fire destroyed six Bel Air homes, valued at roughly $20m. Last week, the nearby Pacific Palisades fire also damaged several multimillion-dollar homes near the beach. There are more than a dozen fires burning across the state, and with no rain in the forecast and more winds, the outlook in the coming days is grim. \u201cThis is when we have the most potential for large and damaging fires,\u201d said Thom Porter, chief of the California department of forestry and fire protection (Cal Fire). \u201cAll of California is in play right now.\u201d The high winds expected in southern California could help spread the Getty fire if firefighters in Los Angeles are not able to contain it by the time the winds pick up. And conditions could complicate efforts to extinguish the still-burning Kincade fire, which as of Monday morning was only 5% contained. The National Weather Service predicted that southern California could see the highest winds of the season, with its peak expected on Wednesday and gusts of up to 80mph in the mountains. High winds, low-humidity and dry vegetation can be a deadly combination for wildfires. Conditions statewide made California \u201ca tinderbox\u201d, said Jonathan Cox, a spokesman for the California department of forestry and fire protection. For residents in both north and south, fleeing wildfires has become a way of life. In the city of Santa Rosa, some residents have only just returned to homes destroyed by the 2017 northern California fires, which killed 44 people, when they were forced to flee the Kincade blaze. Coffey Park, a dense neighborhood in north Santa Rosa, is still deep in the midst of rebuilding. With smoke from the fire bearing down over the weekend, many Coffey Park residents had evacuated. But on Sunday, one woman stood in the doorway of her home that she recently, finally finished rebuilding after wildfires in 2017. She covered her face with her hands. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving again,\u201d said Debbie, who decline to give her last name. \u201cThis time I\u2019m gonna stay and I\u2019m gonna burn in my house.\u201d PG&amp;E, which was driven into bankruptcy because of legal claims over its role in several deadly wildfires in recent years, admitted on Monday that despite the outages, its power lines might have started two smaller fires over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has also said its transmission lines may have been responsible for the Kincade fire. The utility has been roundly criticized for its handling of the blackouts, the first of which came early in October. And in a new, 230-page report made public on Monday, PG&amp;E acknowledged \u201csignificant shortcomings\u201d, admitting that its communication with customers and agencies was inadequate. With heavy smoke spilling out over the Bay Area on Monday, commuters noticed a new trend: a growing number of area residents donning air masks that can help filter particles floating in the smoky air. Experts recommend that residents limit their time outdoors, but the thousands of people forced to sleep outdoors as a result of the housing crisis don\u2019t have that luxury. A local organization, Mask Oakland, has been organizing volunteers to hit the streets and hand out air masks to the homeless.\ufeff",

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) claim they played a key role in tracking down Baghdadi to a compound in northern Syria where he was reportedly planning his escape over the nearby border into Turkey. Donald Trump has thus played down the role of the SDF, who fought the military campaign against Isis with US troops, but whom Trump abandoned earlier this month by ordering US troops to stand aside before a Turkish offensive against the Syrian Kurds. \u201cSince 15 May, we have been working together with the CIA to track Al Baghdadi and monitor him closely,\u201d Polat Can, a senior SDF official said on Twitter. \u201cOne of our sources was able to reach the house where Al Baghdadi was hiding. Al Baghdadi changed his places of residence very often. He was about to move to a new place in Jerablus [on the border with Turkey].\u201d He continued: \u201cOur own source, who had been able to reach Al Baghdadi, brought Al Baghdadi\u2019s underwear to conduct a DNA test and make sure (100%) that the person in question was Al Baghdadi himself.\u201d Trump has claimed credit for masterminding the operation that led to Baghdadi\u2019s death, but according to the SDF version, his withdrawal of US forces led to a postponement of the operation. \u201cMore than a month ago, the decision was made to eliminate Al Baghdadi. However, the US withdrawal and the Turkish invasion prompted us to stop our special operations, including the pursuit of Al Baghdadi. The Turkish invasion caused a delay in the operation,\u201d Can said. \u201cOur intelligence source was involved in sending coordinates, directing the airdrop, participating in and making the operation a success until the last minute.\u201d The SDF commander, General Mazloum Kobani, also referred to a SDF-run spy in Baghdadi\u2019s entourage in interviews with US media on Monday. Asked about the SDF role in the operation in Idlib province late on Saturday night, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, gave a carefully-worded reply, saying he was \u201cnot going to comment on what may or may not have happened with the SDF\u201d but stressing that the air operation and the soldiers sent into the compound were exclusively US special forces. Mazloum told NBC that the SDF agent was at the Baghdadi compound when the assault took place, that he had served as a security adviser to the Isis leader and that his betrayal was motivated by revenge. The husband of Baghdadi\u2019s sister-in-law has emerged as another key figures earlier on in the hunt for the Isis leader. According to Iraqi intelligence officials, Muhammad Ali Sajid al-Zobaie led them to a desert tunnel on the Iraqi Syrian border, where items linked to the Isis leader were found. The Iraqis say they found a weapon, medical bags, religious books and a small handbag containing maps and hand-drawn locations inside the cache. From that starting point, the smuggler who proved central to the hunt was located, as was one of Baghdadi\u2019s wives and a nephew. All three were co-opted, and they led Iraqis and Syrian Kurds who had then been enlisted by the CIA to northern Idlib province, near an area called Jebel al-Druze in the beginning of September. Baghdadi is thought to have not long been in the province and was regularly moving between a series of simple houses. In a Pentagon briefing Milley gave few new details about the Saturday raid on a compound near the Syrian-Turkish border which led to Baghdadi\u2019s death when he detonated a suicide vest in a tunnel. \u201cBaghdadi\u2019s remains were then transported to a secure facility to confirm his identity with forensic DNA testing, and the disposal of his remains has been done, and is complete, and was handled appropriately,\u201d Milley said. Another Pentagon official confirmed that Baghdadi\u2019s body was buried at sea at an unnamed location, similar to the 2011 sea burial of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden after he was killed in a US special forces raid in Pakistan. He said that two men had been captured alive at the compound and were in US custody in an unspecified location. Milley said he could not confirm Trump\u2019s claim that Baghdadi had been \u201cwhimpering and crying\u201d as he fled US forces in a tunnel at the compound. \u201cThe president had planned a talk down to the unit and unit members,\u201d the general said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the source of that was, but I assume it was talking directly to unit.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The London fire brigade\u2019s readiness for the Grenfell Tower fire was \u201cgravely inadequate\u201d and fewer people would have died if it had been better prepared, a long-awaited public inquiry report into the disaster that killed 72 people has concluded.</p> \n<p>The first phase of the report into the biggest single loss of life in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> since the second world war also ruled that the building had been refurbished in breach of safety regulations and that contrary to the evidence so far of the cladding panel manufacturer, Arconic, \u201cthe principal reason why the flames spread so rapidly up the building\u201d was its aluminium composite panels and the \u201cmelting and dripping of burning polyethylene\u201d.</p> \n<p>The retired appeal court judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick, who led the inquiry, found that despite senior officers knowing about the risk of cladding fires from high rise blazes abroad, the \u201cpreparation and planning for a fire such as Grenfell\u201d by the London fire brigade (LFB) fell far short of what should have been expected.</p> \n<p>Moore-Bick used the 1,000-page report to criticise the LFB\u2019s commissioner Dany Cotton for \u201cremarkable insensitivity\u201d for claiming in evidence to the inquiry that she wouldn\u2019t change anything the brigade did on the night. It showed \u201cthe LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire\u201d.</p> \n<p>He concluded many lives could have been saved if her officers had identified sooner that the fire was out of control and told residents to evacuate. He found that the LFB failed to train its incident commanders and firefighters in how to recognise the need for evacuation or in the dangers of combustible cladding.</p> \n<p>Bereaved and survivors welcomed Moore-Bick\u2019s much-delayed but \u201cstrong\u201d conclusions after previously<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/26/grenfell-survivors-fear-inquiry-judge-will-side-with-establishment\"> fearing he would delay making significant findings</a> until the second phase of the inquiry which begins next year, which will examine the refurbishment project that preceded the fire.</p> \n<p>Moore-Bick said there was already \u201ccompelling evidence that the external walls of the building failed to comply with requirements\u201d of building regulations governing fire safety. They didn\u2019t adequately resist the spread of fire, \u201con the contrary they actively promoted it\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Lawyers for the LFB sought the ruling that the building breached regulations, arguing the \u00a310m refit completed in 2016 was \u201ccatastrophically non-compliant with fire safety requirements\u201d. The LFB has said the entire safety strategy for Grenfell Tower required any fire to remain compartmentalised and that it could not have been expected to cope if the building was changed to allow fire to spread as it did.</p> \n<p>Moore-Bick praised the \u201cextraordinary courage and selfless devotion to duty\u201d of rank-and-file officers and said \u201cthose in the control room and those deployed on the incident ground responded with great courage and dedication in the most harrowing of circumstances\u201d.</p> \n<p>But the absence of an operational evacuation plan for Grenfell Tower was \u201ca major omission\u201d by the LFB, which was guilty of an \u201cinstitutional failure\u201d to inform firefighters about the risks of cladding fires before the disaster. On the night of the fire there was a \u201cfailure of command\u201d which meant firefighters with extended-duration breathing kits were deployed too slowly.</p> \n<p>Michael Dowden, the watch manager from North Kensington fire station and the commander on the scene for most of the first hour, was criticised for failing to consider an evacuation sooner and not making efforts to find out what residents were telling 999 operators or the conditions in the building. The inquiry heard an officer of his rank would not normally be in charge of such a huge fire, but Moore-Bick concluded: \u201cI have little doubt that fewer people would have died if the order to evacuate had been given by 2am.\u201d</p> \n<p>The report was informed by evidence from hundreds of witnesses including 88 firefighters, control room officers and senior LFB commanders, together with 35 of the bereaved, survivors and residents.</p> \n<p>In September, the LFB said leaders of the brigade have been interviewed under caution by Scotland Yard detectives in relation to health and safety offences.</p> \n<p>The report is set to be published in full on Wednesday, but was circulated to the bereaved, survivors and residents on Monday morning. Those seen collecting printed copies included Nabil Choucair who lost six members of the family in the fire, Clarrie Mendy, the aunt of the celebrated young artist Khadija Saye who died with her mother Mary Mendy, and Natasha Elcock, the chairwoman of Grenfell United who escaped with her partner and daughter but lost her uncle, who lived on an upper floor.</p> \n<p>Everyone who received an advance copy of the report was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement before taking it away.</p> \n<p>Among the 72 victims of the fire were 19 children, and Cotton angered their relatives in her evidence when she compared preparing to tackle a fire like Grenfell to developing \u201ca training package for a space shuttle landing on the Shard\u201d, in other words something she would never need to do.</p> \n<p>Moore-Bick addressed this saying it showed an \u201cunwillingness to confront\u201d the fact that in October 2016 LFB fire engineers produced a slideshow titled \u201cTall Building Facades\u201d featuring cladding fires around the world. It warned of \u201ca need to understand what products are being used in the facade system and their fire behaviour \u2026 These could affect the way fires develop and spread in a building.\u201d</p> \n<p>The findings came 26 months after Theresa May set up the inquiry in the wake of the disaster that devastated the north Kensington community and sparked a national fire safety crisis. Over 400 other tower blocks in England were found to have been wrapped in similar combustible cladding to that of Grenfell Tower.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 October 2019 because an earlier version mistakenly described Martin Moore-Bick as a retired high court judge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b545ceba-9401-402d-929b-dab803cc0cce\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RddAQ0pyUXE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "The London fire brigade\u2019s readiness for the Grenfell Tower fire was \u201cgravely inadequate\u201d and fewer people would have died if it had been better prepared, a long-awaited public inquiry report into the disaster that killed 72 people has concluded. The first phase of the report into the biggest single loss of life in London since the second world war also ruled that the building had been refurbished in breach of safety regulations and that contrary to the evidence so far of the cladding panel manufacturer, Arconic, \u201cthe principal reason why the flames spread so rapidly up the building\u201d was its aluminium composite panels and the \u201cmelting and dripping of burning polyethylene\u201d. The retired appeal court judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick, who led the inquiry, found that despite senior officers knowing about the risk of cladding fires from high rise blazes abroad, the \u201cpreparation and planning for a fire such as Grenfell\u201d by the London fire brigade (LFB) fell far short of what should have been expected. Moore-Bick used the 1,000-page report to criticise the LFB\u2019s commissioner Dany Cotton for \u201cremarkable insensitivity\u201d for claiming in evidence to the inquiry that she wouldn\u2019t change anything the brigade did on the night. It showed \u201cthe LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire\u201d. He concluded many lives could have been saved if her officers had identified sooner that the fire was out of control and told residents to evacuate. He found that the LFB failed to train its incident commanders and firefighters in how to recognise the need for evacuation or in the dangers of combustible cladding. Bereaved and survivors welcomed Moore-Bick\u2019s much-delayed but \u201cstrong\u201d conclusions after previously fearing he would delay making significant findings until the second phase of the inquiry which begins next year, which will examine the refurbishment project that preceded the fire. Moore-Bick said there was already \u201ccompelling evidence that the external walls of the building failed to comply with requirements\u201d of building regulations governing fire safety. They didn\u2019t adequately resist the spread of fire, \u201con the contrary they actively promoted it\u201d he said. Lawyers for the LFB sought the ruling that the building breached regulations, arguing the \u00a310m refit completed in 2016 was \u201ccatastrophically non-compliant with fire safety requirements\u201d. The LFB has said the entire safety strategy for Grenfell Tower required any fire to remain compartmentalised and that it could not have been expected to cope if the building was changed to allow fire to spread as it did. Moore-Bick praised the \u201cextraordinary courage and selfless devotion to duty\u201d of rank-and-file officers and said \u201cthose in the control room and those deployed on the incident ground responded with great courage and dedication in the most harrowing of circumstances\u201d. But the absence of an operational evacuation plan for Grenfell Tower was \u201ca major omission\u201d by the LFB, which was guilty of an \u201cinstitutional failure\u201d to inform firefighters about the risks of cladding fires before the disaster. On the night of the fire there was a \u201cfailure of command\u201d which meant firefighters with extended-duration breathing kits were deployed too slowly. Michael Dowden, the watch manager from North Kensington fire station and the commander on the scene for most of the first hour, was criticised for failing to consider an evacuation sooner and not making efforts to find out what residents were telling 999 operators or the conditions in the building. The inquiry heard an officer of his rank would not normally be in charge of such a huge fire, but Moore-Bick concluded: \u201cI have little doubt that fewer people would have died if the order to evacuate had been given by 2am.\u201d The report was informed by evidence from hundreds of witnesses including 88 firefighters, control room officers and senior LFB commanders, together with 35 of the bereaved, survivors and residents. In September, the LFB said leaders of the brigade have been interviewed under caution by Scotland Yard detectives in relation to health and safety offences. The report is set to be published in full on Wednesday, but was circulated to the bereaved, survivors and residents on Monday morning. Those seen collecting printed copies included Nabil Choucair who lost six members of the family in the fire, Clarrie Mendy, the aunt of the celebrated young artist Khadija Saye who died with her mother Mary Mendy, and Natasha Elcock, the chairwoman of Grenfell United who escaped with her partner and daughter but lost her uncle, who lived on an upper floor. Everyone who received an advance copy of the report was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement before taking it away. Among the 72 victims of the fire were 19 children, and Cotton angered their relatives in her evidence when she compared preparing to tackle a fire like Grenfell to developing \u201ca training package for a space shuttle landing on the Shard\u201d, in other words something she would never need to do. Moore-Bick addressed this saying it showed an \u201cunwillingness to confront\u201d the fact that in October 2016 LFB fire engineers produced a slideshow titled \u201cTall Building Facades\u201d featuring cladding fires around the world. It warned of \u201ca need to understand what products are being used in the facade system and their fire behaviour \u2026 These could affect the way fires develop and spread in a building.\u201d The findings came 26 months after Theresa May set up the inquiry in the wake of the disaster that devastated the north Kensington community and sparked a national fire safety crisis. Over 400 other tower blocks in England were found to have been wrapped in similar combustible cladding to that of Grenfell Tower. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 October 2019 because an earlier version mistakenly described Martin Moore-Bick as a retired high court judge.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s the simplest of formulas \u2013 put X number of people united by one common factor and differing in almost all other respects in front of cameras and let what will be be \u2013 but when it works, it really works.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0009tvl\" title=\"\">Who Are You Calling Fat?</a> (BBC Two) it is the turn of nine people living with obesity to be brought together under one Oxfordshire roof for a month to examine attitudes to fatness. At one end of the spectrum is gastric-banded 57-year-old Del, who was previously 25st, and had many health issues, together with side-effects from the drug he takes to control them. At the other end of the spectrum is Victoria, a fat-positive advocate and activist who calls bariatric surgery \u201cstomach amputation\u201d and considers \u201coverweight\u201d and \u201cobese\u201d to be offensive terms that carry unnecessary moral implications by suggesting there is a weight you \u201cshould\u201d be. The rest fall between them, with civil servant Babs at the most conflicted midpoint: she hates \u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cthe amount of adipose tissue she carries\u201d and herself for having accumulated it. But after a life of futile dieting and covering up on the beach, she wishes she could find a way for her size not to matter to her \u2013 or at least not to dominate her life.</p> <p>All nine seem mentally robust enough to preclude the accusations of exploitation commonly made against this kind of thing \u2013 your mileage may vary, of course. They articulate their own life experiences and their responses to the various positions held by those in the house.</p> <p>Victoria is the primary catalyst for discussions, reappraisals and/or retrenchments among the group. Watching 25-year-old Jack, who has overhauled his lifestyle since being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, swimming in the outdoor pool she notes that society distinguishes between \u201cgood fatties, who work out, performing to show that they\u2019re worthy\u201d while \u201cbad fatties eat pizza\u201d. She is \u201can intuitive eater\u201d who believes that when nothing is forbidden, the craving for the (socioculturally) sinful goes away. Jack \u201cthinks it\u2019s all a load of bollocks, to be honest\u201d and carries on swimming, weight-training and running.</p> <p>He also invites a Diabetes UK volunteer, Colin, who lost his leg and suffered in various other ways from complications of the disease, to talk about the impact of his obesity (Colin and Jack have no problem with the word). Victoria, Miranda and David cluster in a room afterwards, seeking solace in their shared outrage at his use of shaming and fatphobic language. Others, including Jed, decide to head to the doctor for the first time in years. They disagree with Victoria that \u201cthe science is bogus\u201d and do not find the same comfort Miranda does in her assertion that \u201cskinny people can be unhealthy too\u201d.</p> <p>There is the emotional set piece mandated by all reality documentaries \u2013 here, a blindfolded Victoria, Courtney and eventually Babs stripping down in a busy high street and inviting people to write supportive messages on their skin \u2013 but the real substance lies in the rest. Watching Victoria at work is to be visited by endless important questions. Where does truth give way to conspiracy theorising? Is the fat positivity movement a necessary corrective to fat people\u2019s unquestionable marginalisation, or a damaging cult?

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the simplest of formulas \u2013 put X number of people united by one common factor and differing in almost all other respects in front of cameras and let what will be be \u2013 but when it works, it really works. In Who Are You Calling Fat? (BBC Two) it is the turn of nine people living with obesity to be brought together under one Oxfordshire roof for a month to examine attitudes to fatness. At one end of the spectrum is gastric-banded 57-year-old Del, who was previously 25st, and had many health issues, together with side-effects from the drug he takes to control them. At the other end of the spectrum is Victoria, a fat-positive advocate and activist who calls bariatric surgery \u201cstomach amputation\u201d and considers \u201coverweight\u201d and \u201cobese\u201d to be offensive terms that carry unnecessary moral implications by suggesting there is a weight you \u201cshould\u201d be. The rest fall between them, with civil servant Babs at the most conflicted midpoint: she hates \u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201cthe amount of adipose tissue she carries\u201d and herself for having accumulated it. But after a life of futile dieting and covering up on the beach, she wishes she could find a way for her size not to matter to her \u2013 or at least not to dominate her life. All nine seem mentally robust enough to preclude the accusations of exploitation commonly made against this kind of thing \u2013 your mileage may vary, of course. They articulate their own life experiences and their responses to the various positions held by those in the house. Victoria is the primary catalyst for discussions, reappraisals and/or retrenchments among the group. Watching 25-year-old Jack, who has overhauled his lifestyle since being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, swimming in the outdoor pool she notes that society distinguishes between \u201cgood fatties, who work out, performing to show that they\u2019re worthy\u201d while \u201cbad fatties eat pizza\u201d. She is \u201can intuitive eater\u201d who believes that when nothing is forbidden, the craving for the (socioculturally) sinful goes away. Jack \u201cthinks it\u2019s all a load of bollocks, to be honest\u201d and carries on swimming, weight-training and running. He also invites a Diabetes UK volunteer, Colin, who lost his leg and suffered in various other ways from complications of the disease, to talk about the impact of his obesity (Colin and Jack have no problem with the word). Victoria, Miranda and David cluster in a room afterwards, seeking solace in their shared outrage at his use of shaming and fatphobic language. Others, including Jed, decide to head to the doctor for the first time in years. They disagree with Victoria that \u201cthe science is bogus\u201d and do not find the same comfort Miranda does in her assertion that \u201cskinny people can be unhealthy too\u201d. There is the emotional set piece mandated by all reality documentaries \u2013 here, a blindfolded Victoria, Courtney and eventually Babs stripping down in a busy high street and inviting people to write supportive messages on their skin \u2013 but the real substance lies in the rest. Watching Victoria at work is to be visited by endless important questions. Where does truth give way to conspiracy theorising? Is the fat positivity movement a necessary corrective to fat people\u2019s unquestionable marginalisation, or a damaging cult? Does the fact that medical advice is often too unthinkingly mixed with prejudice and acceptance of social norms actually mean that \u201chealth is a social construct\u201d and that there is no such thing as a healthy weight? Does self-love mean indulging every appetite to its fullest, heedless of others\u2019 opinions or likely consequences for yourself, or is there a better definition to be had? At one point, interspersed with shots of Colin struggling to move around the house and off sofas, the unseen interviewer asks Victoria if she wouldn\u2019t prefer to have her body than Colin\u2019s. She contends that: \u201cIf you are asking \u2018Would I prefer to have mobility?\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s an ableist question.\u201d Language itself buckles under the weight it has to bear. From there we are easily into broader questions, such as what evangelism offers the preacher and the preached to, when silent tolerance of others\u2019 beliefs becomes irresponsible, and what the limits can/are/should/should not be on matters of self-identification. Where do we end up if there are no such things as facts? Wholly liberated, or constrained by the uncertainty of the shifting sands about us? Discuss, long into the night. Altogether it is a programme that carries an unexpected heft, and carries it well.",

We want something that definitely and definitively takes no deal off the table and ensures that the voting rights of all of our citizens are protected ... </p> \n   <p>We agree that an early election is necessary.

Here is an excerpt.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Prime ministers <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/may-at-10-by-anthony-seldon-grumpy-theresa-was-terrible-campaigner-say-ex-aides-rkkch2mgj\">earn authority and respect</a> from ministers in part on how effectively they conduct themselves in cabinet, just as respect from MPs is earned by their conduct in the house. One official in attendance at cabinet comments: \u201cShe didn\u2019t enjoy chairing cabinet. Nor did she enjoy the company of cabinet colleagues. I began to think she thought cabinet was a waste of her time. Her initial ambition was of a \u2018return to cabinet government\u2019, similar to Gordon Brown when he became prime minister. But it was not true. She had neither the time, nor patience, nor inclination to discuss important matters in cabinet and cabinet committees. Someone said she was a good poker player. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, because she wasn\u2019t that subtle and didn\u2019t think deeply enough. On most prime ministerial issues, other than those she had dealt with at the Home Office, she didn\u2019t have a view at all. She had neither political friends nor any idea that they were important to a prime minister.</p> \n   <p>Another official adds: \u201cShe was the least collegiate prime minister I ever worked with, worse even than Gordon Brown because she was not as bright and lacked his intelligence and vision. She was very insular and couldn\u2019t communicate.

The term is close to useless in casting light on a leader, but as far as it means anything, it points us in the wrong direction here. Politically she was in a much weaker position, but as a personality she remained the most stubborn prime minister to occupy No 10 for many decades \u2013 arguably more so than Margaret Thatcher. Often Thatcher was more expedient than she seemed. May was a wilful leader in a weak position: an explosive combination.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Prime Ministers is superb, one of those rare books that can change the way you think about politics, and I would recommend it strongly. It covers every PM from Harold Wilson to May, focusing not so much on what they did as on what their premierships reveal about leadership, and about what works and what doesn\u2019t. This is a subject often not fully addressed by biographers, and almost never as well as by Richards here.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc89c4652672451ac11add895c19ab0be9dc9d13\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc89c4652672451ac11add895c19ab0be9dc9d13/0_222_4651_2791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May in the Commons for PMQs last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May in the Commons for PMQs last week.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-29T09:57:56.871Z\">at 9.57am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db70ee88f0859498cfb43aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-28T15:53:59.926Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Sun\u2019s <strong>Matt Dathan</strong> has more on today\u2019s shadow cabinet.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/matt_dathan/status/1188844280741318656\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At today's meeting of the Shadow Cabinet Diane Abbott tore into Labour MPs opposed to an election, saying the PLP can \"go f*** themselves\".</p>\u2014 Matt Dathan (@matt_dathan) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matt_dathan/status/1188844280741318656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 28, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/matt_dathan/status/1188844371598368770\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That full Diane Abbott quote at Shadow Cabinet according to one in the room was:&nbsp;\u201cThe PLP were in the tea room and my office crying about an election saying Jeremy should stand down in 2017.

We recommend that the house should suspend Mr Vaz from its service for six months.</p> \n   <p>We note that this suspension, if agreed by the House, will trigger the provisions of the Recall of MPs Act 2015 and require a recall petition to be opened in Mr Vaz\u2019s constituency.</p> \n   <p>We further recommend that if Mr Vaz were to cease to be a member of the house for whatever reason, he should not be eligible to be granted a former member\u2019s pass.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This recommendation has to be approved by the Commons as a whole, but that is almost automatic in the case of reports from this committee.</p> \n  <p>No MP has ever been suspended for this long since the second world war, as<a href=\"http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN02430/SN02430.pdf\"> this report (pdf)</a> confirms, although one Labour MP was expelled from the Commons <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Allighan\">in 1947</a>, and a Conservative<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Baker_(British_politician)\"> in 1954</a>.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3031708689fcf0c5e41de3f9649ed000db1abf9e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3031708689fcf0c5e41de3f9649ed000db1abf9e/0_76_4013_2407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Vaz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Vaz.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gadd/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-28T16:08:10.446Z\">at 4.08pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db6eeba8f08993584c8c099\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-28T13:36:13.593Z\">1.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From the BBC\u2019s <strong>Laura Kuenssberg</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1188794136897433600\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Shadow Cabinet sat down to discuss position at 12 - members aware it's much harder for them to resist call for election with the other two main opposition parties out backing one</p>\u2014 Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1188794136897433600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 28, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db6ed428f08142786c51a33\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/angeliquechrisafis\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-28T13:35:08.460Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>President Macron\u2019s office said France had worked all weekend to insist on very clear conditions written \u201cin black and white\u201d to allow the UK\u2019s Brexit extension.

Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the PM was in Essex on a visit connected to the death last week of 39 people found in the back of lorry. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The PM has not yet seen the EU\u2019s response to parliament\u2019s request for a delay, and the PM will respond once he has seen the detail. His view has not changed: parliament should not have put the UK in this position and we should be leaving on 31 October.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>With a delay inevitable, Johnson\u2019s spokesman was repeatedly pressed on whether the PM had any contrition for failing to keep to the key campaign pledge which arguably most helped him become Conservative leader and thus enter No 10. The answer, while oblique, was a definite \u201cno\u201d.

Here are three reasons why.</p> \n  <p><strong>1 - Boris Johnson has now failed to achieve what he set out as the most important goal of his premiership.</strong> Even at the end of last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/oct/25/pm-claims-it-is-still-possible-to-achieve-brexit-on-31-october-video\">he was still claiming that Brexit could happen by 31 October</a>, but that dream is now dead. And it is hard to overstate how important this was to the Johnson project. During the Tory leadership campaign the most important issue that separated Johnson from Jeremy Hunt, his challenger, was that Johnson said Brexit would have to happen by 31 October, whereas Hunt said it was more realistic to accept that the deadline might slip. After becoming prime minister Johnson repeatedly said unequivocally Brexit would happen by 31 October, particularly on social media. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/boris-johnson-rather-be-dead-in-ditch-than-agree-brexit-extension\">He said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than extend Brexit.</a> And then, of course, there were the Tory countdown clocks, one of which was delivered to No 10. Presumably this morning they have been stalled.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Conservatives/status/1156649060981497857\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Party Chairman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesCleverly?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JamesCleverly</a> with the \u23f0<br><br>\u270d We will deliver Brexit by October 31st. <br><br>Back <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a>'s pledge here: <a href=\"https://t.co/ZkcKvLONpm\">https://t.co/ZkcKvLONpm</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/aFF4Kfcav3\">pic.twitter.com/aFF4Kfcav3</a></p>\u2014 Conservatives (@Conservatives) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Conservatives/status/1156649060981497857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 31, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But Johnson\u2019s monumental failure in this regard begs a much bigger question ...</p> \n  <p><strong>2 - Johnson\u2019s political future now depends on whether voters will forgive him for breaking his signature promise. </strong>Sometimes politicians can be destroyed by failing to deliver on a high-profile promise (eg George Bush putting up taxes, when Americans remembers \u201cRead my lips, no new taxes\u201d, and Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems putting up tuition fees, when they promised before the 2010 general election to vote against tuition fee increases). But sometimes politicians can get away with it <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1451596/Blair-broke-promise-on-tuition-fees-says-Howard.html\">(Tony Blair also broke a tuition fees promise)</a>, and so far the polling evidence suggests that Johnson (a politician who has more experience than most at getting away with flouting norms) and his party does not seem to have been damaged much by the expectation (confirmed this morning) that Brexit would be delayed. (See the polling below.) What seems to be working in his favour is the perception that at least he tried. Whether or not opinion turns against him on this later may decide the next election.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1188566838386581506\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here's how the polls have changed since last week:<br><br>CON: 35.1% (+0.3)<br>LAB: 25.4% (-)<br>LDEM: 18.1% (-0.1)<br>BREX: 11.3% (-0.1)<br>GRN: 4.0% (-0.2)<br><br>via Britain Elects poll tracker<br><br>More: <a href=\"https://t.co/spVpGNV8oG\">https://t.co/spVpGNV8oG</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/dCH4dacG8Z\">pic.twitter.com/dCH4dacG8Z</a></p>\u2014 Britain Elects (@britainelects) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1188566838386581506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 27, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>3 - The EU decision will make it harder for Labour to justify opposing an early election. </strong>At one point Jeremy Corbyn was saying that, as soon as the Benn act became law, Labour would be ready to vote for an election.

This is how <strong>Jo Swinson</strong>, the Lib Dem leader, explained it on The Andrew Marr Show yesterday. She said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have worked hard in parliament to try to secure a majority for a people\u2019s vote. It hasn\u2019t been forthcoming. Even this week we tabled an amendment. We have tabled amendments for a people\u2019s vote 17 times and Labour have not backed them in sufficient numbers. In contrast, 19 Labour MPs voted for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But this morning <strong>Tom Baldwin,</strong> communications director for the People\u2019s Vote campaign, insisted that there was a majority in the current House of Commons for a second referendum. He told the Today programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The more people look at Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, the more they realise this is perhaps not quite what was promised. And if we can expose Boris Johnson\u2019s deal for what it is, I believe there is a majority in the current House of Commons for a confirmatory referendum. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When challenged on this, he repeated the point about the majority being there for a second referendum once the flaws in Johnson\u2019s deal were obvious. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[The majority is there] when you have exposed Boris Johnson\u2019s deal for what it is. What I have said all the way through is that our strategy is to be the last thing standing. We are not an option in this crisis. We are a solution to it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>I described Baldwin as the communications director of the People\u2019s Vote campaign but that is a moot point because Baldwin was on the programme to discuss the reports that emerged last night that he had been sacked. Here is our overnight story about the row.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/28/peoples-vote-senior-figures-forced-out\">People's Vote senior figures forced out</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Baldwin told the Today programme that he did not actually work for <strong>Roland Rudd</strong>, one of the People\u2019s Vote campaign figureheads and the person who supposedly sacked him, and that he would be going into work as normal today.</p> \n  <p>In a subsequent interview Rudd said that Baldwin had not been fired, but that he was being offered \u201can opportunity for a different type of role\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Rudd also said he thought there was \u201ca real opportunity\u201d this week to get MPs to vote for a confirmatory referendum. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more MPs supporting us than ever before and I think we have every chance to be able to get that prize, which is being able to put it back to the people,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>As <strong>Michael Savage </strong>explained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/27/peoples-vote-campaign-civil-war-struggle-strategy-splinter-group\">in this Observer article at the weekend</a>, the row at the People\u2019s Vote campaign is largely about strategy, and the extent to which it should transform into an overt remain campaign. But, as with most feuds in smallish political organisation, personality clashes are thought to have been a factor too.</p> \n  <p>People\u2019s Vote supporters can take comfort from the fact that something very similar happened to the Vote Leave campaign in 2016. Dominic Cummings, its campaign director, came close to being ousted in a boardroom coup, but survived. Vote Leave went on to win.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cce1dc0a0663f6c44f760d0c4b965766be861eb3\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce1dc0a0663f6c44f760d0c4b965766be861eb3/361_37_1607_964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Baldwin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Baldwin.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-28T12:31:44.332Z\">at 12.31pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db6b7f88f0898437061ca48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-28T09:42:37.652Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From Sky\u2019s<strong> Michelle Clifford</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/skynewsmichelle/status/1188752685866110976\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichelBarnier?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MichelBarnier</a> says he\u2019s always happy when decisions are taken after EU27 agree to give UK Brexit \u201cflextension\u201d until Jan 31st.

I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Damien Gayle, and back from a particularly ill-timed half-term holiday. I\u2019ve missed some intense parliamentary drama, although, as is usual with Brexit, deadlock and uncertainty still prevail.</p> \n  <p>Or perhaps not. Today Boris Johnson is staging a third vote on an early election \u2013 which, again, he is expected to win, but not by the two-thirds majority required under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for it to actually happen.</p> \n  <p>But this morning we have had fresh evidence that the government is gearing up to support the Liberal Democrat/Scottish National party proposal to bypass the FTPA by using legislation to schedule an early poll. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/26/boris-johnson-no-brexit-until-january-block-christmas-general-election\">the plan was revealed in the Observer</a>, James Cleverly, the Conservative chairman, yesterday dismissed it as \u201ca gimmick\u201d.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: Boris Johnson vowed to renew his push for a 12 December general election after being denied it in the Commons. MPs voted by 299 to 70 in favour of holding the election, though that was 135 short of the two-thirds majority required by law. Later, Downing Street said the prime minister would seek to amend the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act to allow an election on that date anyway. The prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal will not be brought back to this parliament. No 10 pledged to drop it in a bid to convince the SNP and the Lib Dems to support the push for a general election before Christmas. Boris Johnson formally broke his promise to bring the UK out of the EU on 31 October. The prime minister accepted the bloc\u2019s offer of a three-month extension, though Brexit could still happen before 31 January if MPs vote through a deal to leave. This parliament has \u201crun its course\u201d, Johnson said as he demanded the pre-Christmas election just a fortnight after insisting on setting out a new legislative programme. No 10 claimed the Commons was to blame for the further delay to Brexit, not the prime minister. The MP, Keith Vaz, should be suspended for six months, the Commons standards committee recommended. Its report said Vaz had expressed willingness to buy a class A drug. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleague Rowena Mason has the full story: My colleagues, Rowena Mason and Rajeev Syal, have been looking into what they\u2019ve termed the \u201cmeltdown: at the People\u2019s Vote campaign. It\u2019s embroiled in infighting after the chairman, Roland Rudd, fired two directors by email over the weekend. Today, Peter Mandelson \u2013 an Open Britain board member \u2013 has said: Roland Rudd is like the captain of the Titanic demanding the passengers show him more respect as the iceberg carves open the hull and water gushes into the bowels of the ship. Operation Yellowhammer, Whitehall\u2019s no-deal Brexit planning effort, has been shelved, the government has confirmed. While it\u2019s understood that some planning for such an eventuality will continue because the government\u2019s official position is that the possibility of it yet happening remains open, Yellowhammer has been stood down operationally. In August, my colleague Rowena Mason helpfully set out the findings of a government report on Yellowhammer that set out the probable consequences of a no-deal Brexit. It makes for useful reading this evening: The SNP will not be \u201cdancing to Boris Johnson\u2019s tune\u201d on his demands to get a general election on 12 December, one of its MPs has said. Kirsty Blackman told Channel 4 News: We are keen for there to be a general election before the 12th. I don\u2019t trust Boris Johnson. I\u2019m not convinced I trust him to follow through on any promises that he\u2019s likely to make on this. We may have conversations with many different people but we will not be dancing to Boris Johnson\u2019s tune on this. Boris Johnson could have secured a general election by supporting the Lib Dems\u2019 bill for a vote on 9 December, the party\u2019s leader, Jo Swinson, has said. The prime minister has lost another vote in parliament. This latest attempt to force his bad Brexit bill through parliament has failed because this parliament simply does not trust him. Boris Johnson claims he wants a general election, but he also claimed he wouldn\u2019t prorogue parliament or put a border down the Irish sea. If Boris Johnson wants a general election, then he could have supported our bill for a general election on 9 December. Instead, he has chosen to stick to his original plan for 12 December, which we have already rejected. Labour made suggestions it was poised to reject Johnson\u2019s latest bid to get a pre-Christmas general election. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the proposed 12 December vote would \u201cdisenfranchise\u201d voters including students and cause voters \u201cimmense\u201d difficulties getting to the polls. Asked if Labour would rule out a winter general election, he told Sky News: I think it\u2019s very unwise to be having a general election in the run-up to Christmas. If it comes, it comes. We will get on with it and we will take our proposals to the people. I doubt the wisdom of holding it at this time of year; it\u2019s not a wise choice. MPs will be asked to vote for the general election under the one-clause motion on Tuesday, the Press Association understands. A one-clause motion to amend the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (FTPA) to call for a general election with the specific date of 12 December will be laid tonight, an unnamed Downing Street source has told the Press Association. The source is also quoted as saying that the withdrawal agreement bill to implement Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal \u2013 referred to as the WAB \u2013 will not be put back to MPs. Tonight we are laying a one-clause motion to amend the FTPA and call an election with the named day of 12 December. The bill is very similar to the LD/SNP bill. The WAB will not be put back. This is the way to get Brexit done so the country can move on. Only one Labour MP voted with the prime minister for a general election this evening: Kate Hoey. Johnson had the support of 280 of his Tory colleagues and 18 independents. No Conservative MP voted against, though Ken Clarke \u2013 formerly of the party and now sitting as an independent \u2013 did vote \u2018no\u2019. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told the Commons his party would support the prime minister\u2019s new plan for a 12 December election if he gave a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d he would not bring back the withdrawal agreement bill. It is clear that there is a desire on the opposition benches to bring forward a bill that can give us an election. But we don\u2019t trust this prime minister and we don\u2019t trust this prime minister for good reason. So, the prime minister, if he is going to bring forward a bill, must give an absolute cast-iron assurance that, up until the passage of that bill and the rising of parliament, that there will be no attempt to bring forward the withdrawal agreement bill. Raising his point of order after belatedly entering the Commons, Corbyn told MPs: I apologise to you and to the prime minister for not being here at the point when he raised his point of order, I was detained outside the chamber, I\u2019m now back here. I understand a bill will be tabled tomorrow. We will obviously look [at] and scrutinise that bill and we look forward to a clear, definitive decision that no deal is absolutely off the table and there is no danger of this prime minister not sticking to his word \u2013 because he has some form on these matters \u2013 and taking this country out of the EU without any deal whatsoever, knowing the damage it will do to jobs and industries all across this country. The Labour MP Stephen Doughty says he was wrong when he suggested earlier that there were rumours that Boris Johnson could stand as a candidate in East Yorkshire, not in his current constituency, Uxbridge and South Ruislip. (See 5.42pm.) He says the Tory MP for East Yorkshire, Sir Greg Knight, has been readopted as a candidate. Doughty says he muddled the constituency up with another one. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Jeremy Corbyn says Labour will look at the bill and scrutinise it. He says Labour wants a definite statement about no deal being off the table. He says this must be clear, because the PM has \u201csome form\u201d for not keeping his word. Boris Johnson makes a point of order. People will find Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stance \u201cbewildering\u201d. Johnson says tonight the government will give notice of its plans for a short bill for a general election on Thursday 12 December. Johnson says he will legislate for an early election. A bill will not be subject to a super-majority, and with the Lib Dems and the SNP potentially supporting the government (although they want a different date), Johnson has a good chance of winning. MPs have backed the motion by 299 votes to 70 - leaving Boris Johnson 135 votes short of the votes he needed for this division to have force. Reading out the result, John Bercow says this technically means \u201cthe noes have it\u201d. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Boris Johnson\u2019s first attempt to call an early election using the Fixed-term Parliaments Act super-majority procedure was on 4 September. The motion was passed by 298 votes to 56 - leaving Johnson 136 votes short of the target he needed. And the second attempt was on 9 September. That motion was passed by 293 votes to 46 - leaving Johnson 141 votes short. MPs are now voting. Here is the text of the motion: That there shall be an early parliamentary general election. For the motion to pass and have effect, it needs to be backed by two-thirds or more of all MPs \u2013 434. No one expects it to clear that hurdle. What we are really waiting for is not the result, but what Boris Johnson says once it is over. He is expected to use a point of order to make an announcement about what the government will do next. Mike Gapes, the former Labour MP who now sits for the Independent Group for Change, told MPs that internet campaigning would not be properly regulated in any election held in the next few weeks. His group is opposed to an early election. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford I\u2019ve updated some of the earlier posts from the opening of the debate with direct quotes. But to see the updates, you may need to refresh the page. The DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, is speaking now. He says what is on offer is not Brexit for the whole of the UK, because it leaves Northern Ireland in the single market. He describes the PM\u2019s deal as a \u201cdeath deal to the union\u201d. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has just finished speaking now. She said that she wanted a second referendum but did not believe there was a majority for it in the Commons. That is why she wanted an early election, she said. She argued that this provided the best chance of stopping Brexit. Anna Soubry, the former Tory MP who now leads the Independent Group for Change, intervened. She said she thought there was now a majority in the Commons for a confirmatory referendum. Swinson did not accept this. Like Blackford, Swinson also defends giving 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote - but without making it a precondition for backing an early election. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, told MPs that his party would not back the motion for a December 12 election but would support efforts for a December 9 poll. If we enable this motion to pass, we will be out [of the EU] before the prime minister\u2019s election. We cannot allow the Prime Minister to railroad through this disastrous so-called deal. We will support the Liberal Democrats\u2019 proposals for an election before Brexit can happen, with no reintroduction of the withdrawal agreement bill. Because given the way that some Labour MPs voted we cannot trust Labour to block the Bill in future. Asked by the Tory Brexiter Iain Duncan Smith if the SNP would insist on amending an early election bill to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote, Blackford said his party favoured this because it was the right thing to do. (In Scotland 16 and 17-year-olds were given the vote for the 2014 independence referendum, and subsequently they were allowed to vote in elections to the Scottish parliament and for local government.) But Blackford did not appear to insist on this as a red line. From RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly on Boris Johnson\u2019s letter to Donald Tusk. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said about the conditions that would need to be apply for Labour to back an early election. He said: Many of us are very cautious of believing anything the prime minister said. We want it tied down before we agree to anything. The 12 December election is less than a fortnight before Christmas, nine days before the shortest day of the year. The house must consider that in parts of this country it will be dark before 4pm. Many students will have just finished their term and gone home for Christmas ... and they risk being disenfranchised ... As I was saying about students and their opportunity to vote on the dates in question, the latter point may not be the case on the 9 December and we will consider carefully any legislation proposed that locks in the date. The theme of this is we don\u2019t trust the prime minister. We want something that definitely and definitively takes no deal off the table and ensures that the voting rights of all of our citizens are protected ... We agree that an early election is necessary. But also seek good reason, since no general election has been held in December since 1923 ... When no deal is off the table, when the date for an election can be fixed in law, and when we can ensure that students are not being disenfranchised, we will back an election so this country can get the government it needs. And here are the main points. Corbyn appeared to rule out accepting an early election on Thursday 12 December, the government\u2019s preferred date. He suggested this would lead to students being disenfranchised. But he suggested that Labour could back on early election taking place on Monday 9 December (the date proposed by the Lib Dems and the SNP). But the date would have to be set in law, he said (something that would happen if MPs passed an amendment to the Fixed-term Parliament\u2019s Act for an early election, but not if MPs used a FTPA super-majority vote to trigger one - because that mechanism would allow the PM to decide the election date.) Labour sources are saying it would be a mistake to take Corbyn\u2019s words as implying that he favours an election in early January. (See 5.48pm.) That would involve the election campaign taking place over the Christmas holidays - something that would probably be as popular with voters as the plague. Journalists are split over the precise implications of Corbyn\u2019s words. This is from the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson. And this is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. I will post the exact quotes in a moment so that you are better able to judge who\u2019s right. Corbyn also says he is opposed to an election on Thursday 12 December, particularly because students might not be at university to vote. Corbyn says Labour will not agree to an early election until the government has committed itself to a specific date. This is significant because it implies Labour could support, or at least abstain on, legislation to amend the Fixed-term Parliaments Act to allow an early election. Labour\u2019s Stephen Doughty intervenes to say there are rumours that Johnson will not even stand as an MP at the election in his constituency, Uxbridge and South Ruislip (where he had a majority of 5,034 at the last election). Johnson may stand in Sevenoaks (where there was a Tory majority of 21,917 in 2017) or East Yorkshire (where it was 15,006), Doughty says. Johnson shakes his head but does not intervene. UPDATE: Corbyn also took an intervention from the Labour MP Paula Sherriff who said Johnson still had not apologised for what he said to her in a debate in September implying her concerns about death threats to MPs were \u201chumbug\u201d. Corbyn replied: I will be happy to give way now to the prime minister if he wants to get up and apologise to my friend for what he said about her during that debate. Johnson replied: I will happily apologise if the shadow chancellor would for instance apologise for inviting the population to lynch [Tory minister Esther McVey]. Corbyn said: \u201cSorry seems to be the hardest word, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Jeremy Corbyn is responding to Boris Johnson. He says Johnson has broken his promises. This is a prime minister who cannot be trusted. Having illegally prorogued parliament for five weeks for his Queen\u2019s speech, he now abandons that Queen\u2019s speech. He got his deal through a second reading then abandoned it. He promised us a budget on November 6 and then he abandoned that too. He said he would never ask for an extension and he said he would rather die in a ditch - another broken promise. The government spent \u00a3100m on an advertising campaign saying the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October. He says that money could have been spend on food parcels for food banks, or social care packages. He says an investigation for Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches programme has revealed that the government has been holding secret meetings with US drug companies about the price paid for drugs by the NHS. He says the prime minister has not confirmed that he will be accepting the extension offered by the EU. This provokes much jeering from MPs who have been reading Twitter on their phones. Johnson intervenes and says he has sent a letter to the EU confirming that he will obey the law. (Corbyn will have written his speech before the text of the PM\u2019s letter to Tusk was published. See 5.31pm.) Boris Johnson has written to Donald Tusk, president of the European council, confirming that the UK is accepting the extension offered by the EU. Under the Benn Act, he had no choice. See 10.13am. Here is his letter (pdf). In the letter Johnson urges the EU to rule out any further extension beyond 31 January. Johnson accuses Jeremy Corbyn of wanting to frustrate the wishes of the people. Corbyn has \u201crun out of excuses\u201d, he says. He says first Corbyn said the Benn act would have to pass for Labour to back an election. Then Corbyn said the Benn act would have to be implemented, Johnson says. And now Corbyn is coming up with more extreme excuses, he says. He says Corbyn now wants the government to rule out a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020. We must have an election now, we cannot continue with this endless delay, and I don\u2019t know about you Mr Speaker, but I think the leader of the opposition has now run out of excuses ... And he\u2019s still coming up with ever more ludicrous excuses for hiding from the British people. Now he says we\u2019ve got to take no-deal off the table at the end of the transition period in December 2020. Would it not make sense, according even to his own logic, for him to agree to an election now, so that he can have an opportunity to take no-deal off the table himself - isn\u2019t that the logic of his position? He says Corbyn\u2019s allies, like the Lib Dems and the SNP, are deserting him. He can run, but he cannot hide forever. Across parliament, his supposed allies are deserting him. The SNP, I now read, are in favour of an election, and the Lib Dems are in favour of an election. What an incredible state of affairs that there is one party tonight that is actually against a general election. There is one party that does not trust the people of this country, and that is the principal party of opposition. I hope he accepts tonight that he is snookered, that this charade has gone on for long enough, that he will agree to allow Brexit to get done, and then allow us to make our cases to the people. And, when that election comes, the people of this country will have to make a choice between a government that delivers, a government that not only got a great Brexit deal when they said it was impossible, but which is also putting 20,000 more police on the streets, delivering the biggest hospital building programme in a generation, investing \u00a314bn more in our schools in levelling up education funding across the country, a great one nation Conservative government, which is what we represent, and a Labour opposition that would turn the year 2020 into a toxic tedious torture of two more referendums. The DUP MP Ian Paisley intervenes. If Boris Johnson wins the election, will he implement the Brexit deal he negotiated? Or will he try and renegotiate the provisions for Northern Ireland. Johnson says he will be campaigning to implement the \u201cexcellent deal\u201d he negotiated. Boris Johnson is opening the debate on his motion calling for an early election. It is the third time he has asked MPs to vote on this. After both previous debates Johnson won the vote - but not with the two-thirds majority required under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for the vote to count. He starts by saying that MPs do not want an early election. But there is a widespread view that this parliament has \u201crun its course\u201d, he says. He says it is not capable of delivering on the priorities of the people. Across the country there is a widespread view that this parliament has run its course. I simply do not believe that this house is capable of delivering on the priorities of the people, whether that means Brexit or anything else. This is from the Conservative Brexiter MP Craig Mackinlay. Steve Baker, the Tory MP who chairs the European Research Group, which represents hardline Brexiters, thinks his colleague has a point. The Scottish parliament\u2019s information centre has produced a 39-page briefing (pdf) on what the withdrawal agreement bill means for Scotland. According to a snap YouGov poll, only around a quarter of people think the UK will leave the EU by 31 January \u2013 the new deadline set by the EU. The Times has been serialising the new book about Theresa May\u2019s premiership by Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell, but May probably wishes they weren\u2019t. Saturday\u2019s excerpts (paywall) focused on how bad she was as a campaigner. Today\u2019s (paywall) include comments from insiders arguing that she was pretty hopeless at managing cabinet too. Here is an excerpt. Prime ministers earn authority and respect from ministers in part on how effectively they conduct themselves in cabinet, just as respect from MPs is earned by their conduct in the house. One official in attendance at cabinet comments: \u201cShe didn\u2019t enjoy chairing cabinet. Nor did she enjoy the company of cabinet colleagues. I began to think she thought cabinet was a waste of her time. Her initial ambition was of a \u2018return to cabinet government\u2019, similar to Gordon Brown when he became prime minister. But it was not true. She had neither the time, nor patience, nor inclination to discuss important matters in cabinet and cabinet committees. Someone said she was a good poker player. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, because she wasn\u2019t that subtle and didn\u2019t think deeply enough. On most prime ministerial issues, other than those she had dealt with at the Home Office, she didn\u2019t have a view at all. She had neither political friends nor any idea that they were important to a prime minister. Another official adds: \u201cShe was the least collegiate prime minister I ever worked with, worse even than Gordon Brown because she was not as bright and lacked his intelligence and vision. She was very insular and couldn\u2019t communicate. She shared one trait with Brown, though: neither trusted people, and both were very tribal.\u201d There is also a perceptive essay on May in the new book from Steve Richards, The Prime Ministers. He says that, although May was often described as weak, that does not explain her flaws as a PM. May was often described as \u2018weak\u2019. The term is close to useless in casting light on a leader, but as far as it means anything, it points us in the wrong direction here. Politically she was in a much weaker position, but as a personality she remained the most stubborn prime minister to occupy No 10 for many decades \u2013 arguably more so than Margaret Thatcher. Often Thatcher was more expedient than she seemed. May was a wilful leader in a weak position: an explosive combination. The Prime Ministers is superb, one of those rare books that can change the way you think about politics, and I would recommend it strongly. It covers every PM from Harold Wilson to May, focusing not so much on what they did as on what their premierships reveal about leadership, and about what works and what doesn\u2019t. This is a subject often not fully addressed by biographers, and almost never as well as by Richards here. The Sun\u2019s Matt Dathan has more on today\u2019s shadow cabinet. In the Commons Priti Patel, the home secretary, has just delivered a statement about the 39 people who were found dead in the back of a lorry in Essex. As well as updating MPs on the fact that a lorry driver has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, she said that those who died were the victims of \u201cbrutal and unscrupulous criminal gangs\u201d and a reminder of the evils of people trafficking. She said that the nationality of the 39 people who died has still not been confirmed, and that the investigation would be long and meticulous. She also said the Border Force was increasing its presence at Purfleet and that Belgium was allowing the UK to deploy more border officials in Zeebrugge. From the Financial Times\u2019s Sebastian Payne There are five MPs in the Independent Group for Change (aka continuity Change UK). They will not be voting for an early election, Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall reports. \u201cShock bombshell\u201d is sarcasm (not always obvious on Twitter) because it is widely assumed that the IGC MPs will all lose their seats at the election. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth ITV\u2019s Joe Pike has more on John Mann. The Treasury has confirmed that Labour\u2019s John Mann has been appointed steward and bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds - the archaic process that means he is no longer an MP. He is going to the House of Lords to take up a post as an independent government adviser on antisemitism. Mann voted leave in 2016 and was one of the 19 Labour MPs who voted to give Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill a second reading last week. The shadow cabinet seems to have wrapped up. This is from my colleague Rowena Mason. This is from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. And this is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. Here are two questions from readers about the Lib Dem/SNP proposal for a general election on Monday 9 December, instead of Thursday 12 December (which is what the government is proposing). What are the advantages of having the election on Monday 9 December, not Thursday 12 December? The Lib Dems have not officially given an explanation for this, but in private, party sources have said one advantage of having the election on the Monday rather than the Thursday is that students are more likely to be at university on the Monday. This is from the academic Ivor Gaber. In a very useful analysis for the Higher Education Policy Institute website, Nick Hillman, its director, points out that there are seats where the student vote has clearly helped the Lib Dems. But he also concludes: It is hard to find a single general election when the student vote determined who got the keys to Number 10. Even if the contested claim that student support for Jeremy Corbyn made a big difference at the 2017 election is true, Labour still lost (as Kay Burley famously reminded Richard Burgon MP the other day). There are other advantages to the Liberal Democrats from a 9 December election. It would allow more time for a new government to agree a Brexit deal, or negotiate another extension, before the 31 January deadline. And it would allow even less time for Boris Johnson to pass his Brexit deal, which is something the Lib Dems are opposing ahead of an early election. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, instead of just amending it as the Lib Dems and the SNP propose? The Lib Dems and the SNP are proposing legislation that would effectively allow a one-off exemption from the FTPA, to allow an early election to take place this year. Theresa May prepared a similar bill in 2017, although in the end she did not need it because (to her surprise) Labour agreed to vote for an early election (meaning she had the two-thirds majority needed under the FTPA for an election poll to go ahead). Another option would be to repeal the FTPA wholesale. But this would effectively put the power to call an election back entirely in the hands of the prime minister, at a time when the trend has been to curtail these prerogative powers (as in the supreme court ruling on article 50), not extend them. In the current circumstances, it is very hard to see how this would get through parliament. The Commons standards committee has just published a report on its very long-running inquiry into the Labour MP Keith Vaz. It is recommending that he be suspended as an MP for six months for expressing willingness to buy a class A drug. Here is an extract from the report (pdf). We have found that Mr Vaz acted in breach of paragraph 16 of the 2015 House of Commons code of conduct. By expressing willingness to purchase a class A drug, cocaine, for others to use, thereby showing disregard for the law, and by failing to cooperate fully with the inquiry process, thereby showing disrespect for the house\u2019s standards system, he has caused significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole. This is a very serious breach of the code. We recommend that the house should suspend Mr Vaz from its service for six months. We note that this suspension, if agreed by the House, will trigger the provisions of the Recall of MPs Act 2015 and require a recall petition to be opened in Mr Vaz\u2019s constituency. We further recommend that if Mr Vaz were to cease to be a member of the house for whatever reason, he should not be eligible to be granted a former member\u2019s pass. This recommendation has to be approved by the Commons as a whole, but that is almost automatic in the case of reports from this committee. No MP has ever been suspended for this long since the second world war, as this report (pdf) confirms, although one Labour MP was expelled from the Commons in 1947, and a Conservative in 1954. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg President Macron\u2019s office said France had worked all weekend to insist on very clear conditions written \u201cin black and white\u201d to allow the UK\u2019s Brexit extension. An \u00c9lys\u00e9e official said: All weekend, France took the initiative with Germany, Ireland, Donald Tusk\u2019s team and a few other countries, to fix the terms of the extension very precisely: that the withdrawal agreement isn\u2019t renegotiable, that the UK would follow a code of conduct and allow the EU\u2019s 27 members to meet to discuss other issues for their future [such as the budget], and that the UK must legally appoint a commissioner if the European commission sits before the UK leaves. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e said France\u2019s long-held preference for a much shorter extension had focused minds, put on pressure and allowed those clear conditions to be put in place. After Macron was styled by some media as seeking to put a spanner in the works of a longer extension, the Elys\u00e9e official said this had never been France\u2019s line. A veto or tension is not our approach. We always build a collective solution in the end ... The most important issue is the unity of the EU\u2019s 27 members. We wanted to preserve that unity without creating a crisis over Brexit. Because the worst outcome would be for Brexit \u2013 a British political crisis \u2013 to be imported to the EU and spread a form of poison and division that we don\u2019t want. The source added that France\u2019s main concern was to stay out of British internal politics and to ensure that a Brexit extension was justified. Some said we were playing Boris Johnson\u2019s game, or the British opposition\u2019s game. We have never tried to take any part in Britain\u2019s internal game. The official said Macron had no interest in imposing a General de Gaulle or Napoleon-inspired \u201csplendid isolation\u201d within the EU. France has now insisted that in December the EU\u2019s 27 members must sit down in the cold light of day to hold discussions on strategy for the future negotiations over the relationship with the UK. The official said: It\u2019s healthy to sit down and lay out our ideas for future negotiations, to stop reacting in the heat of the moment to this or that Brexit event. Yesterday Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, posted a thread on Twitter explaining why her party was supporting the Lib Dem call for an early election. She said there was no evidence that there was a majority in parliament now for a second referendum. And she also commended this article by the prominent anti-Brexit journalist Ian Dunt arguing why an election now was probably the best option for remainers. Her thread starts here. The SNP normally works closely with Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, but on this issue the two nationalist parties are divided. Plaid Cymru says a second referendum should come first. In a statement Liz Saville Roberts, its leader at Westminster, said: Boris Johnson has failed to deliver on yet another promise. Working together, opposition parties have stopped Mr Johnson delivering his damaging Brexit deal \u2013 or no deal \u2013 on Halloween. Those of us opposed to inflicting the harm of Brexit on the four nations of the UK must now unite again to deliver the most sensible way to end this mess \u2013 a final say referendum. The extension granted by the EU should now be used to secure a people\u2019s vote and end the Brexit chaos. If the government fail to deliver this, opposition parties must work together, and if necessary, form a caretaker government to deliver this most democratic solution to Brexit. These are from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom. Ahead of the vote this afternoon on his call for an early election, Boris Johnson has used a Commons written statement to set out the election timetable that would be followed if he secures the two-thirds majority required under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for an early election to go ahead. He said: The government has tabled a motion proposing that an early general election be held. The motion is in the terms set out in section 2(2) of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. If agreed to by a super-majority of the House of Commons, an early election will take place in accordance with that act. In the event this house approves the motion for an early election, I will recommend that Her Majesty the Queen appoints 12 December as the date of the general election. This would mean parliament dissolving just after midnight on 6 November. In line with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the date of parliament\u2019s return will be set by royal proclamation following dissolution, and I will recommend to the Queen that the first meeting of the new parliament takes place before 23 December. Labour says it will only back an early election when a no-deal Brexit has been taken off the table and one concern it has raised is that an early election could result in a new government not taking office until mid January, leaving it very little time to pass a new deal. Johnson declaration that the new parliament would meet before Christmas in the event of the election taking place on Thursday 12 December seems intended to address this point. Government sources are now briefing the broadcasters that if Boris Johnson fails to get the two-thirds majority needed this evening to trigger an early election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, he will table a very similar bill tomorrow. These are from Laura Kuenssberg, Robert Peston and Beth Rigby, political editors at the BBC, ITV and Sky respectively. No 10 did not go quite this far on the record at the morning lobby briefing, but journalists who attended were left with the impression that this was being planned (see 12.15pm) and it is also what Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, was suggesting in interviews this morning. (See 8.39am.) There are two Commons statements today, and no urgent questions. That means the debate on holding an early election should start soon after 5.30pm, with the vote soon after 7pm (90 minutes later). Boris Johnson has no intention of apologising for failing to meet his repeatedly promised deadline of 31 October to leave the EU, and believes parliament is to blame for the delay, Downing Street has said. At the regular lobby briefing there was not, as yet, a formal response to the EU\u2019s offer of another extension, to 31 January. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the PM was in Essex on a visit connected to the death last week of 39 people found in the back of lorry. He said: The PM has not yet seen the EU\u2019s response to parliament\u2019s request for a delay, and the PM will respond once he has seen the detail. His view has not changed: parliament should not have put the UK in this position and we should be leaving on 31 October. With a delay inevitable, Johnson\u2019s spokesman was repeatedly pressed on whether the PM had any contrition for failing to keep to the key campaign pledge which arguably most helped him become Conservative leader and thus enter No 10. The answer, while oblique, was a definite \u201cno\u201d. His spokesman said: What the prime minister has done, despite being told it was impossible, was secure a deal and set out a timetable which would have allowed us to deliver that deal on 31 October. Parliament has stood in the way of being able to deliver Brexit. Pressed repeatedly on the matter, he eventually said: \u201cI think I\u2019ve said all I have to say on that matter.\u201d What does seem more likely is that Downing Street could embrace a version of the Lib Dem-inspired plan to force an election via a new bill requiring a simple majority in the Commons, if its attempt to call one through a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA) does not reach the necessary two-thirds majority, as seems inevitable. Asked about the idea of a bill-based election, Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the government was \u201ccurrently focused on the FTPA bill\u201d. But if this falls, it seems there could be movement on an election bill pretty quickly. It is understood the government could even accept the Lib Dems\u2019 preferred election date of 9 December, meaning that, to allow the required five-week campaign period, the election would need to be called this week. With parliament not due to sit on Friday, and set to be dominated on Wednesday by the response to the report into the Grenfell tragedy, that would leave Tuesday or Thursday. Yet even with this tight timetable, so far there have been no talks between the Lib Dems and No 10. Here are three journalists all making broadly the same set of points, which sum up quite well the 24-carat dysfunctionality of Westminster at the moment. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From the Atlantic\u2019s Tom McTague This is from the politics professor Philip Cowley on the issue of whether or not Boris Johnson gets the blame for the Brexit extension. (See 10.55am.) From Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London The prime minister and the home secretary joined Essex emergency services this morning to pay their respects to the 39 people found dead in a refrigerated lorry trailer last week, the Press Association reports. Alongside senior local dignitaries, Boris Johnson and Priti Patel, whose constituency of Witham is in Essex, signed a book of condolence and will lay wreaths in Mulberry garden outside the Thurrock civic offices in remembrance. From my colleague Peter Walker, who has been at the No 10 lobby briefing. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, is also urging the UK not to waste this extension. This morning John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, claimed that the Lib Dem decision to back an early election (see 8.39am) showed that they were aligning with the Tories and \u201cselling out the People\u2019s Vote campaign\u201d. That prompted this response from Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader. The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has received a sobering warning that its deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, may lose his seat to Sinn F\u00e9in in the next election. Steve Aiken, the incoming leader of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), has ruled out a tactical voting pact with the DUP, leaving Dodds vulnerable in his Belfast North constituency. The prospect will complicate the DUP\u2019s calculations over whether to back efforts in Westminster to trigger a December election. The UUP and DUP have cooperated in recent elections to avoid splitting the unionist vote in marginal constituencies, enabling Dodds to fend off Sinn F\u00e9in and lead the DUP\u2019s 10 MPs at Westminster. Over the weekend Aiken, a former submarine commander who is due to take charge of the UUP next month, announced it would contest every seat and not make a pact with a party that had bungled Brexit and \u201cbesmirched unionism with its corruption and sleaze\u201d, a reference to the cash-for-ash scandal. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said this would imperil Dodds, who faces a stiff challenge from Sinn Fein\u2019s John Finucane, the mayor of Belfast. \u201cI think that\u2019s really regrettable, that\u2019s something for him to reflect on, I think it\u2019s something for wider unionism to reflect on,\u201d she said. Something else to reflect on: according to a new poll 65% of voters in Northern Ireland believe Brexit will make a united Ireland more likely within 10 years. And more from Jennifer. This is a reference to what Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said in April, when the UK\u2019s second and longer Brexit extension was agreed. \u201cPlease do not waste this time,\u201d he said. The Conservative party then embarked on a leadership contest, and it was six months before the new PM presented a revised deal to parliament. Tusk may feel his advice was not taken very seriously. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin This is from David Sassoli, president of the European parliament. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston The announcement that the EU would agree to delay Brexit until 31 January did not come as a surprise to anyone this morning. But it is still a milestone in the Brexit process, and arguably one of the most important moments in Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership. Here are three reasons why. 1 - Boris Johnson has now failed to achieve what he set out as the most important goal of his premiership. Even at the end of last week he was still claiming that Brexit could happen by 31 October, but that dream is now dead. And it is hard to overstate how important this was to the Johnson project. During the Tory leadership campaign the most important issue that separated Johnson from Jeremy Hunt, his challenger, was that Johnson said Brexit would have to happen by 31 October, whereas Hunt said it was more realistic to accept that the deadline might slip. After becoming prime minister Johnson repeatedly said unequivocally Brexit would happen by 31 October, particularly on social media. He said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than extend Brexit. And then, of course, there were the Tory countdown clocks, one of which was delivered to No 10. Presumably this morning they have been stalled. But Johnson\u2019s monumental failure in this regard begs a much bigger question ... 2 - Johnson\u2019s political future now depends on whether voters will forgive him for breaking his signature promise. Sometimes politicians can be destroyed by failing to deliver on a high-profile promise (eg George Bush putting up taxes, when Americans remembers \u201cRead my lips, no new taxes\u201d, and Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems putting up tuition fees, when they promised before the 2010 general election to vote against tuition fee increases). But sometimes politicians can get away with it (Tony Blair also broke a tuition fees promise), and so far the polling evidence suggests that Johnson (a politician who has more experience than most at getting away with flouting norms) and his party does not seem to have been damaged much by the expectation (confirmed this morning) that Brexit would be delayed. (See the polling below.) What seems to be working in his favour is the perception that at least he tried. Whether or not opinion turns against him on this later may decide the next election. 3 - The EU decision will make it harder for Labour to justify opposing an early election. At one point Jeremy Corbyn was saying that, as soon as the Benn act became law, Labour would be ready to vote for an election. With the party split internally about the wisdom of an early election, Corbyn has now set new hurdles for what might be needed before his party would be willing to back an early poll. Yesterday the party said Johnson would have to rule out a no-deal Brexit in all circumstances before Labour would agree to an election. But this argument is starting to sound tenuous (at other times the party has said assurances from Johnson cannot be believed), and so it is conceivable that Corbyn could lift his opposition to an early poll. From PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield We have not had a response from No 10 yet to the EU Brexit extension decision. But under the terms of the Benn act (the law that was passed requiring Boris Johnson to request an extension), he has to accept the offer. This is what it says in section 3(1): If the European council decides to agree an extension of the period in article 50(3) of the treaty on European Union ending at 11.00pm on 31 October 2019 to the period ending at 11.00pm on 31 January 2020, the prime minister must, immediately after such a decision is made, notify the president of the European council that the United Kingdom agrees to the proposed extension. Here is our main story from Daniel Boffey and Jon Henley about the EU offering a Brexit \u201cflextension\u201d until 31 January. From the French journalist Quentin Aries From Sky News Bloomberg\u2019s Nikos Chrysoloras has a helpful summary of the \u201cflextension\u201d proposal from the EU. One of the reasons by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are pushing for an election now is because they have given up hope of MPs voting for a second referendum in this parliament. This is how Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, explained it on The Andrew Marr Show yesterday. She said: I have worked hard in parliament to try to secure a majority for a people\u2019s vote. It hasn\u2019t been forthcoming. Even this week we tabled an amendment. We have tabled amendments for a people\u2019s vote 17 times and Labour have not backed them in sufficient numbers. In contrast, 19 Labour MPs voted for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. But this morning Tom Baldwin, communications director for the People\u2019s Vote campaign, insisted that there was a majority in the current House of Commons for a second referendum. He told the Today programme: The more people look at Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, the more they realise this is perhaps not quite what was promised. And if we can expose Boris Johnson\u2019s deal for what it is, I believe there is a majority in the current House of Commons for a confirmatory referendum. When challenged on this, he repeated the point about the majority being there for a second referendum once the flaws in Johnson\u2019s deal were obvious. He explained: [The majority is there] when you have exposed Boris Johnson\u2019s deal for what it is. What I have said all the way through is that our strategy is to be the last thing standing. We are not an option in this crisis. We are a solution to it. I described Baldwin as the communications director of the People\u2019s Vote campaign but that is a moot point because Baldwin was on the programme to discuss the reports that emerged last night that he had been sacked. Here is our overnight story about the row. Baldwin told the Today programme that he did not actually work for Roland Rudd, one of the People\u2019s Vote campaign figureheads and the person who supposedly sacked him, and that he would be going into work as normal today. In a subsequent interview Rudd said that Baldwin had not been fired, but that he was being offered \u201can opportunity for a different type of role\u201d. Rudd also said he thought there was \u201ca real opportunity\u201d this week to get MPs to vote for a confirmatory referendum. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more MPs supporting us than ever before and I think we have every chance to be able to get that prize, which is being able to put it back to the people,\u201d he said. As Michael Savage explained in this Observer article at the weekend, the row at the People\u2019s Vote campaign is largely about strategy, and the extent to which it should transform into an overt remain campaign. But, as with most feuds in smallish political organisation, personality clashes are thought to have been a factor too. People\u2019s Vote supporters can take comfort from the fact that something very similar happened to the Vote Leave campaign in 2016. Dominic Cummings, its campaign director, came close to being ousted in a boardroom coup, but survived. Vote Leave went on to win. From Sky\u2019s Michelle Clifford This is from Donald Tusk, the president of the European council. \u201cFlextension\u201d means flexible extension. If MPs approve the Brexit deal sooner, the UK could leave the EU before 31 January. Under the draft plan being considered by EU ambassadors this morning, 1 December or 1 January would also be possible dates for Brexit in the event of the deal passing. Here are the main items on the agenda for the day. We will be focusing mostly on Brexit-related news, and so I have only included the Brexit-related items. 9am (UK time): EU ambassadors meet in Brussels to discuss the proposed Brexit extension. As Daniel Boffey and Jon Henley report, the EU is expected to agree an extension to 31 January 2020 with an option for the UK to leave earlier if a deal is ratified. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Priti Patel, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: MPs debate the government motion calling for an early election. The debate will last 90 minutes, with voting immediately afterwards. If there are urgent questions or statements, the debate will start not at 3.30pm but later. Late afternoon: MPs start the debate on the second reading of the environment bill. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Damien Gayle, and back from a particularly ill-timed half-term holiday. I\u2019ve missed some intense parliamentary drama, although, as is usual with Brexit, deadlock and uncertainty still prevail. Or perhaps not. Today Boris Johnson is staging a third vote on an early election \u2013 which, again, he is expected to win, but not by the two-thirds majority required under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for it to actually happen. But this morning we have had fresh evidence that the government is gearing up to support the Liberal Democrat/Scottish National party proposal to bypass the FTPA by using legislation to schedule an early poll. After the plan was revealed in the Observer, James Cleverly, the Conservative chairman, yesterday dismissed it as \u201ca gimmick\u201d. But later No 10 sources would not rule out the idea, and this morning Gavin Williamson, the education secretary and former chief whip who has been doing a media round, strongly hinted that the government might back the plan if, as expected, it doesn\u2019t get enough votes this afternoon. From the government\u2019s point of view, the main advantage of the Lib Dem/SNP plan is that passing legislation to amend the FTPA just requires a majority of one, which means the Labour party would not have a veto. There are drawbacks too, because legislation could be amended, but the Lib Dem/SNP proposal does offer a route to a pre-Christmas election. These are from Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen and the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason, covering what Williamson has been saying. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, who together with the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has put forward a tightly drafted bill that would grant an election on 9 December, have said their plan is \u201cstill alive\u201d. Swinson and Blackford have put forward a bill that would grant an election on 9 December \u2013 three days earlier than the PM\u2019s suggested polling date \u2013 as long as the European Union grants an extension until 31 January. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: It certainly, it seems to me a sensible way forward. We also understand from our contacts in the EU that putting forward this bill and sending the letter that we did has helped out EU friends have confidence that if they offer the extension that they\u2019re discussing today that that will be time well spent. One of their big concerns was that they offered an extension earlier this year, said \u2018don\u2019t waste time\u2019, and then we had a Conservative leadership election and Boris Johnson mucked about not trying to get a deal, shutting down parliament, and you know, the very master class in time-wasting so, understandably, they had a degree of reluctance, I think evidenced by the fact they didn\u2019t grant the extension on Friday when many thought they would. So I\u2019m hopeful that as a result of what we\u2019ve done we will see that extension granted today because otherwise we\u2019re still in the very real risk of crashing out without a deal on Thursday. Boris Johnson and his cabinet hope the election of a new Speaker will help force a general election, the Times reports this morning. John Bercow, a b\u00eate noire of the Tory right, retires on Thursday and the government apparently thinks his successor will be much more amenable. \u201cThe government believes his successor will be much less likely to allow backbenchers to seize control of the order paper again to pass legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit,\u201d writes the Times\u2019 deputy political editor, Steven Swinford. Bercow has repeatedly allowed MPs to seize control of Commons business and push through legislation against the wishes of the government, including the so-called Benn act that forced Johnson to go cap in hand to Brussels to ask for a Brexit extension. Johnson might not get what he is looking for, however. Among contenders for Bercow\u2019s job is Harriet Harman. Harriet Harman features in G2 today, speaking to Gaby Hinsliff about her campaign to become the new Speaker and her listening tour of the country, asking people what they think of parliament. Leafing through her notes from the mini listening tour she has undertaken, asking people around the country what they think of parliament, underlines how difficult that has become. Westminster politics is seen as aggressive, entitled, phoney and unprofessional, a braying bear pit hopelessly out of step with modern workplaces, where respect and empathy are increasingly valued. \u201cOne woman said: \u2018I\u2019m a trade union negotiator. I\u2019d get nowhere if I walked into a negotiation and behaved like that,\u2019\u201d Harman recalls. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s been very striking is that people think the anger that\u2019s displayed in parliament is an artefact, that it\u2019s basically fake, playing up to the cameras. So if anybody\u2019s under the impression that their anger is regarded as inspiring by people outside \u2013 people don\u2019t buy it.\u201d And that hints at something more complicated than the crude \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d narrative pushed by Downing Street, pitting furious leave voters against a supposedly obstructive elite. Harman\u2019s research suggests the angry, uncompromising stances that many Brexiters (and, arguably, parts of the left) see as connoting passion or ideological purity don\u2019t always come across that way to voters, many of whom see squabbling and division merely as proof of impotence. Resorting to shouting is seen as \u201cthe ultimate failure of an institution\u201d, says Harman. \u201cIn the outside world, people disagree about Brexit but they get along.\u201d If she\u2019s right, then politicians who believe they are channelling the public mood by ratcheting up their language may be in for a shock come a general election. PA Media reports that the government is going ahead with its preparations for a no-deal Brexit by activating measures to manage traffic on Kent\u2019s motorways despite the EU considering an extension. Operation Brock will come into force at 6am on Monday \u2013 three days before the UK is due to withdraw from the EU and the day parliament votes on whether to hold a snap general election. It comes amid signs the EU is set to grant a fresh Brexit delay until the end of January after Boris Johnson was forced \u2013 under the terms of the so-called Benn act \u2013 to request a further extension. The traffic measures are designed to keep the M20 open in both directions in case there is a disruption to services across the English Channel. Lorries heading for Europe will face a 30mph limit on a 13-mile stretch of the coast-bound carriage of the M20. All other traffic on the motorway \u2013 including lorries carrying out UK deliveries \u2013 must use a 50mph contraflow of two lanes in each direction on the London-bound side of the road. Several holding areas to park lorries are also available to be activated if required, including at Manston airfield. Hauliers must be ready to show they have the correct paperwork before reaching the border or face being turned back. Motorists have been warned to allow for extra travel time and to make sure they have food and water in their vehicles in case of delays. Nicola Bell, the Highways England south-east operations director, said Operation Brock was part of a set of measures in place to allow the M20 and the rest of Kent to keep moving in the event of cross-channel disruption. \u201cWe have worked extensively with our partners in Kent to ensure that the county is as prepared as possible for any disruption to cross-channel services,\u201d she said in a statement. Operation Brock was initially deployed on 25 March, four days ahead of the first planned Brexit date. It was deactivated about three weeks later following the delay to the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, but the steel barriers for the contraflow system and 50mph speed limit remain in place. How the papers covered it There\u2019s a mix of stories on the front pages today, including the killing of Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. But some papers splash on politics, including the Guardian, with our exclusive story \u201cEU read to give UK three-month Brexit extension, leak reveals\u201d. Good morning and welcome to Politics Live on this Monday morning. The government has tabled a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA) for a general election to be held on 12 December. But, in reality, this is not likely to get over the line. The FTPA requires that two-thirds of MPs need to vote to trigger an early election and Labour looks like it will not play ball on this one. However, we may still get an early election, but by a different means, as both the remain-backing Lib Dems and the government have proposed amending the FTPA to pass a separate one-line bill specifying that there will be an election on a certain date. The advantage of this route is that, as a traditional bill, it requires only a straightforward majority to pass the Commons. It is in the Lib Dems\u2019 interest to get an election on the table before a Brexit deal has been locked in and decided, because it is thought their appeal could diminish if people believe the argument has been settled. Meanwhile, according to a leaked draft seen by the Guardian, the EU is preparing to sign off on a Brexit extension to 31 January 2020 with an option for the UK to leave earlier if a deal is ratified, suggesting the EU will agree to the UK\u2019s request for a further delay. As usual, you can get in touch with me while I have the blog in the early hours, on Twitter or via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). Thanks for reading.",

It is more widely used in podcasting, allowing listeners to consume episodes at a greater speed. \u201cWe\u2019re always experimenting with new ways to help members use Netflix,\u201d a Netflix spokesperson said. \u201cThis test makes it possible to vary the speed at which people watch shows on their mobiles. As with any test, it may not become a permanent feature on Netflix.\u201d The news arrives just weeks before their longest original film to date, Martin Scorsese\u2019s 210-minute crime drama The Irishman, which Vanity Fair now points out would now be consumed in under three hours. Netflix, which has recently increased its release of viewing data, counts more than 70% of a movie or episode as a watch.",

The Labour leader said he will consider Boris Johnson\u2019s fresh proposal of an election on 12 December and scrutinise his new short bill when it is introduced on Tuesday. It came after MPs voted down Johnson\u2019s original plan for a 12 December election through the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, which required the support of two-thirds of MPs.

Day 35 Monday 28 October Top developments In response to repeated attacks by Donald Trump on the impeachment inquiry as illegitimate, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced a vote to formalize the inquiry and to lay out steps for moving the inquiry from closed-door depositions to public hearings. The move was designed in part to remove the Trump administration\u2019s main excuse for not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry. Tell me more In an 8 October letter, the White House laid out a policy of blanket defiance of the House inquiry, calling it unfounded and \u201ccontrived\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The EU will start strategising for the post-Brexit trade negotiations with the UK at a December leaders\u2019 summit following Boris Johnson\u2019s formal agreement to an extension to 31 January 2020. There is renewed confidence in Brussels that the UK is moving towards a general election and resolution of the first Brexit phase. Johnson\u2019s attempt to secure both a short period for pushing the withdrawal agreement bill through the Commons as well as a post-Brexit general election on 12 December was defeated on Monday evening. But there are signs that there may still be a majority for a pre-Brexit general election after the government indicated it would table a bill allowing that to happen. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, gave his most positive comments yet about a December poll in his statement to the Commons following the vote on Monday evening. \u201cWe agree that an early election is necessary,\u201d he said. The French government is leading the way in insisting that in December the EU\u2019s 27 members should sit down in the cold light of day to hold discussions on strategy for the future negotiations over the relationship with the UK. An \u00c9lys\u00e9e palace official said: \u201cIt\u2019s healthy to sit down and lay out our ideas for future negotiations, to stop reacting in the heat of the moment to this or that Brexit event.\u201d Earlier on Monday, the EU agreed to a Brexit extension to 31 January 2020, with the option for the UK to leave earlier if a deal is ratified, clearing the way for opposition parties to back a general election. After a 30-minute meeting of European ambassadors, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said the EU27 had agreed to the request made by the British prime minister just over a week ago. Johnson, who said he would rather die in a ditch than delay Brexit, was under an obligation to agree to the terms, breaking his pledge to leave on 31 October, \u201cno ifs, no buts \u2026 do or die\u201d. He later sent a letter insisting that the delay was \u201cunwanted\u201d but confirmed \u201cthe UK\u2019s formal agreement to this extension\u201d. He added he hoped the EU would insist that this would be the last extension but no such pledge was made by any heads of member states or heads of the bloc\u2019s institutions. Sources in Brussels said they would not make any commitments that could be a \u201chostage to fortune\u201d. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: \u201cRelieved that finally no one died in a ditch. Whether the UK\u2019s democratic choice is revoke or an orderly withdraw, confirmed or not in a second referendum, the uncertainty of Brexit has gone on for far too long. This extra time must deliver a way forward.\u201d Under the terms of the extension, the UK has three months more of EU membership but it can leave on the first day of any of those months if the withdrawal agreement is ratified in both Westminster and the European parliament in the meantime. The EU has insisted it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement again. The UK also has \u201can obligation\u201d to nominate a candidate to join the European commission. The prime minister has previously said he will not put forward a nominee. By agreeing the extension through a written procedure, to be completed by Wednesday at the latest, EU leaders will avoid convening for a summit in Brussels. \u201cTusk will launch the written procedure among EU27 with a deadline of 24 hours,\u201d an EU source said. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office said France had worked all weekend to insist on very clear conditions written \u201cin black and white\u201d to allow the UK\u2019s Brexit extension. An \u00c9lys\u00e9e official said: \u201cAll weekend, France took the initiative with Germany, Ireland, Donald Tusk\u2019s team and a few other countries, to fix the terms of the extension very precisely: that the withdrawal agreement isn\u2019t renegotiable, that the UK would follow a code of conduct and allow the EU\u2019s 27 members to meet to discuss other issues for their future [such as the budget], and that the UK must legally appoint a commissioner if the European commission sits before the UK leaves.\u201d The \u00c9lys\u00e9e said France\u2019s long-held preference for a much shorter extension had focussed minds, applied pressure and allowed those clear conditions to be put in place. After Macron was styled by some media as seeking to put a spanner in the works of a longer extension, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e official said this had never been France\u2019s line. \u201cA veto or extension is not our approach. We always build a collective solution in the end ... The most important issue is the unity of the EU\u2019s 27 members. We wanted to preserve that unity without creating a crisis over Brexit. Because the worst outcome would be for Brexit \u2014 a British political crisis \u2014 to be imported to the EU and spread a form of poison and division that we don\u2019t want.\u201d The source added that France\u2019s main concern was to stay out of British internal politics and to ensure that a Brexit extension was justified. \u201cSome said we were playing Boris Johnson\u2019s game, or the British opposition\u2019s game. We have never tried to take any part in Britain\u2019s internal game.\u201d The official said Macron had no interest in imposing a General de Gaulle or Napoleon-inspired \u201csplendid isolation\u201d within the EU. During the ambassadors\u2019 meeting, France\u2019s representative complained that the three-month extension would lift the pressure on MPs to ratify the revised withdrawal agreement, but reluctantly gave his support, EU sources said.",

      "bodyText": "And finally.... America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index has closed at a new all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 finished the day 16.7 points higher at 3,039, up 0.55% today, at its highest ever close. Telecoms and tech stocks drove the rally, with healthcare and consumer-focused firms close behind. The Dow gained 129 points, or 0.5%, to 27,087, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1% to 8,326. Traders ended the day cheered by Donald Trump\u2019s hint of a Phase One trade deal with China next month. Encouraging comments from Beijing overnight that the technical work for a preliminary deal was mostly done also cheered Wall Street. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW With roughly 30 minutes until the closing bell, the S&amp;P 500 is still striding to a record closing high. The index is 0.6% higher today, up 18.35 points at 3,040. Republican congressman Paul Mitchell of Michigan reckons Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts programme deserves some credit: Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco, also believes investors are feeling less anxious: \u201cIt just seems like the things that would disrupt the rally\u2013 tightening monetary policy - off the table. Some kind of big battle with the Chinese seems to be off the table, some kind of political upheaval seems be off the table. \u201cAll of that means the line of least resistance is higher.\u201d (via Reuters, thanks!) Big Tech is playing a key role in the stock market rally, points out Caroline Hyde of Bloomberg: Wall Street seems to have learned to stop worrying about recessions, trade wars and Brexit - at least for the moment. Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin explains (via Reuters). \u201cMost of the things that have been worrying markets haven\u2019t necessarily been resolved but the concern about them has waned a little bit. \u201cIn general, it is more of a lack of bad news than it is an abundance of good news.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story on the big stock market float of the day: Over in Frankfurt, Mario Draghi has signed off from the European Central Bank with a call for close fiscal union. Draghi, whose term ends on Thursday, told his leaving party that monetary union needs to be strengthened (to avoid a repeat of the crises that erupted during his tenure). The road towards a fiscal capacity will most likely be a long one. History shows that budgets have rarely been created for the general purpose of stabilisation, but rather to deliver specific goals in the public interest. In the US, it was the need to overcome the Great Depression that led to the expansion of the federal budget in the 1930s. Perhaps, for Europe, it will require an urgent cause such as mitigating climate change to bring about such collective focus. Whichever path is taken, it is plain to see that now is the time for more Europe, not less. I mean this not in an axiomatic way, but in the truest traditions of federalism. Where results can best be delivered by national policies, let it stay that way. But where we can only deliver on the legitimate concerns of the public by working together, we need Europe to be stronger. The US Dow Jones industrial average is moving towards its own record high today. The benchmark index is up 87 points or 0.3% at 27,045, on hopes of a US-China trade deal (phase one) being inked next month. Microsoft leads the rally, up 2.2%, following by Goldman Sachs (+1.6%), tech firm 3M (+1.5%), and pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer (+1.5%). After a busy morning on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 is firmly on track for a record closing high. The index has held onto its early gains, and is still up 16 points of 0.5% at 3,038 points, as traders grab some lunch. 304 members of the index are up, with 199 down and two unchanged. Takeover target Tiffany is still the top riser, up 31%. Telecoms firm AT&amp;T is up 4% after announcing a three-year strategic plan including $10bn of asset sales. Chipmaker AMD are up 3.2%, as tech stocks are lifted by trade deal hopes. European stock markets have closed higher, taking a lift from the rally in New York. Stocks vulnerable to the trade war, such as industrial firms (including car makers) and tech companies led the rally. Here\u2019s the closing prices: German DAX: up 62 points at 12,957, + 0.6% French CAC: up 16 points at 5,738, +0.3% Italian FTSE MIB: up 86 points at 22,695, +0.4% Spanish IBEX: up 6 points at 9,437, +0.1% FTSE 100: up 6 points at 7,331, up 0.1% In London, the FTSE 100 was held back by the pound, which strengthened after the Brexit extension was agreed, and by HSBC\u2019s losses (-4%) after its weak results today. Pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca gained 4%, though, after reporting that a cancer drug had passed a key trial. Brexit relief is also pushing stock markets higher. David Madden of CMC Markets in London says the EU\u2019s decision to offer a flextension up to 31 January 2020 has cheered the City: Stocks are higher today on the back of the news that Brexit has been delayed until potentially the end of January 2020. The extension was granted this morning, and even though it wasn\u2019t a surprise that Brussels agreed to the three month delay, the confirmation encouraged some buying. The focus will now be on UK politics. Prime Minister Johnson is hoping for a general election in mid-December. Mr Johnson will need the support of two thirds of MPs in order to press ahead with the pre-Christmas election. The Conservatives are doing well in the opinion polls which is why Boris is keen for an election. Jeremy Corbyn claims he will won\u2019t support an election until the no-deal option is removed, but the Labour Party are performing poorly in the polls, and that\u2019s the real reason why they don\u2019t want an election in December Shares in Fitbit, the exercise-tracking tech firm, have surged 27%, following reports that Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is in takeover talks. Expectations of a cut to US interest rates on Wednesday are also lifting shares today. Marie Owens Thomsen of Indosuez explains that a cut - the third this year - is heavily priced in: The markets are pricing a 91% probability (Bloomberg) of a rate cut. The Fed under Jerome Powell appears to be more reluctant to risk surprising the markets than past Feds, and therefore the chance for a move this week is significant. Data of course cuts both ways in a slowing economy. A 3.5% unemployment rate clearly does not warrant a rate cut, although high policy uncertainty (323.2 in September, down from 350.8 in August), and slipping inflation expectations arguably do. A couple of photos from the floor of the New York stock exchange today: Here\u2019s a neat summary of the markets today, from Bloomberg: U.S. stocks reclaimed an all-time high after three months, with the final leg coming on rising optimism for a trade deal with China. Treasuries slumped at the start of a a week packed with earnings and the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decision. The S&amp;P 500 took out its July record after President Donald Trump said the U.S. is ahead of schedule to sign part of the trade deal. Microsoft jumped after winning a Pentagon contract, while AT&amp;T climbed following a board shuffle. Tiffany surged after LVMH said it held discussions with the jeweler. PG&amp;E plunged on liability risk from California wildfires. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose even as banks slipped after HSBC\u2019s disappointing earnings. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a six-week high. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are feeling more upbeat and piling into riskier assets such as equities. He says stock market \u2018bulls\u2019 pushed the S&amp;P 500 to a record high an hour ago: It\u2019s a remarkable achievement against faltering corporate earnings, a festering (if not quite total) trade war, and softer macro data everywhere you look. Bulls had tried their hardest Friday but some really positive noises on trade nudged us over the line today. President Trump said the US and China are looking to be ahead of schedule on sign the \u2018phase one\u2019 trade deal at the APEC meeting in Chile in mid-Nov. The bar on a US-China trade deal had been set so low that the market seems content with this pretty puny agreement. At least the direction is positive. If you\u2019re just tuning in... Today\u2019s rally on Wall Street was sparked by optimistic comments on the US-China trade war from both sides. Overnight, China\u2019s commerce ministry says that technical talks about the phase 1 trade deal text with the US was \u201cbasically completed\u201d. Earlier, the US Trade Representative\u2019s Office said negotiators had \u2018made headway\u2019 on some key issues. Full details here. President Trump then backed this optimism up, by saying negotiations were ahead of schedule. BUT.... this is only for a Phase One trade deal, which might reset relations between the two sides and could lift some tariffs. A full-blown agreement, tackling stickier issues such as forced technology transfers and China\u2019s subsidies, is some distance off. The S&amp;P 500 is scrambling boldly into new heights, now up 19 points at 3,041 for the first time ever. Virtually every sector is up, led by telecoms (+2.6%), technology (+0.9%), healthcare (+0.8%) and basic materials (+0.8%). Tiffany is the top riser, surging 28% following LVMH\u2019s takeover approach. Mihir Kapadia, the CEO of Sun Global Investments, says talk of a Phase One trade deal between the US and China has pushed shares to record levels. Positive sentiment was boosted by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representatives stating that the administration is close to finalizing some sections of the \u201cphase one\u201d agreement with China. Encouraging companies results have also helped, he adds: 3Q earnings have also boosted the market, driving the Tech sector to outperform the rest of the SPX on strength in the semis group. Tech shares were up (+ 1.2% on Friday), followed by Materials (+1.04%) and Energy, as trade optimism and constructive fundamentals propped up oil and base metals prices. Sir Richard Branson had a great view of today\u2019s record high. He\u2019s is on the floor of the New York stock exchange for the flotation of Virgin Galactic. The S&amp;P 500 has now risen by 21% this year. That may be surprising, given trade war jitters and signs that America\u2019s economy is slowing. But the rally has been helped by recent cuts to US interest rates, as the Federal Reserve has bowed to pressure from Trump. Technology stock have played a major role in the rally: Apple: up 56% Microsoft: up 43% Facebook: up 41% Amazon: up 16% The Nasdaq 100 index of large technology companies has also hit a record high. BOOM! The S&amp;P 500 index of US companies listed in New York has opened at a new all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 gained 15 points or 0.4% to hit 3,038 points, a new record level. The Dow Jones industrial average also opened higher, up 112 points or 0.4%. The tech-focused Nasdaq index has gained 0.5%. Traders are taking heart from Donald Trump\u2019s hint that he\u2019ll sign a trade war deal with China\u2019s Xi Jinping next month. Microsoft is helping to drive the rally, up 2.8%, having won the Pentagon\u2019s $10bn cloud computing contract on Friday night. Music streaming service Spotify have jumped by 8.4%, after releasing strong results today. Donald Trump also told reporters that he hopes to sign the deal with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Chile next month. The U.S. president said the phase one portion would \u201ctake care of the farmers\u201d and \u201calso take care of a lot of the banking needs,\u201d adding: \u201cSo we\u2019re about I would say a little bit ahead of schedule maybe a lot ahead of schedule\u201d. Boom! Donald Trump has just predicted that he will sign a preliminary trade deal with China soon. That\u2019s a loud hint that the deal could be signed off at next month\u2019s meeting of Asia-Pacific world leaders. It makes sense, given the reports of progress from Beijing and Washington in recent days. It may drive shares higher on Wall Street today - perhaps to new alltime highs in just 30 minutes time. Reuters has the details: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he expected to sign a significant part of the trade deal with China ahead of schedule but did not elaborate on the timing. \u201cWe are looking probably to be ahead of schedule to sign a very big portion of the China deal, we\u2019ll call it Phase One but it\u2019s a very big portion,\u201d he told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before leaving on a visit to Chicago We all know there\u2019s a gender pay gap problem, but the full scale of the financial hit suffered by women over their careers is pretty shocking. New official data show that women are paid just \u00a3380,000 on average over their lifetimes. Men? They receive \u00a3643,000 over the same period, on average. My colleague Patrick Collinson reports: The Office for National Statistics figures revealed huge inequality between men and women even at the highest levels of educational attainment. It said women with a master\u2019s or PhD degree still made one-third less over their lifetimes than men with the same qualifications. \u201cWomen aged 26 to 35 years with higher degrees have average lifetime earnings of \u00a3803,000, whereas men of the same age with undergraduate level qualifications have average lifetime earnings of around \u00a31,160,000,\u201d said the ONS. Apparently there\u2019s been a small improvement in the last 15 years -- women are now earning 59% of men\u2019s average lifetime earnings; up from 56% in 2004. Not much done, lots more to do.... Here\u2019s our updated story on the Tiffany takeover tussle: Jewellery chain Tiffany has confirmed that rival luxury chain LVMH has tabled a takeover bid. Tiffany &amp; Co says its board of directors were \u201ccarefully reviewing the proposal\u201d and advised shareholders not to take action at this point in time. Shares in Tiffany have spiked by 32% in pre-market trading. Over in New York, traders are speculating that the S&amp;P 500 index could hit a new record high today. Stocks are up in the futures market, following encouraging noises on a trade deal from China and the US over the weekend (see earlier post). British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson is floating his Virgin Galactic spaceflight company on Wall Street too.... The prospect of another Brexit extension will irk some UK companies, as they stare at massive stockpiles of raw materials, parts and finished goods. Bosses now have to decide whether to whittle these supplies down, or maintain them in case Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 January (the new deadline agreed by EU leaders today). Amanda Tickel, global Brexit lead at Deloitte, says businesses will have \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Donald Tusk\u2019s announcement today. While there is relief that the disruption of a no-deal exit on 31 October is off the table, further delay prolongs uncertainty. Businesses will be wondering what to do with partially implemented restructuring, stockpiles and logistics plans. With the added stepping stone of a possible election in the coming weeks, planning for the future could be even harder. Tickel adds that businesses will be \u2018exhausted\u2019 by the prospect of another crunch deadline in three months time: \u201cWhile preparedness levels vary, business has generally listened to the clear government messaging to get ready for Brexit on 31 October. With the prospect of preparing for a fourth deadline, there\u2019s a feeling of extension exhaustion. The CBI\u2019s retail sales survey shows that UK consumers are notably cautious, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club Her\u2019s his take: A notable feature of the survey was that retailers\u2019 stock levels relative to expected sales reached a record high in October. This was a consequence of a double driving force of uncertainty ahead of the 31 October scheduled date for the UK to leave the EU and the proximity to Christmas Retailers will be particularly worried that consumers appear to be cautious over spending as the vital Christmas shopping period looms; they will be hoping that some of the recent lacklustre sales performance is due to consumers taking a breather before splashing out over the festive season. The survey indicates that retailers are far from confident about the near-term outlook for sales with a marginal positive balance of +1% expecting them up year-on-year in November. Here\u2019s are the key findings from the CBI\u2019s monthly healthcheck Retail sales volumes in the year to October fell for the sixth consecutive month (-10%) but at the slowest pace over this period so far. Retailers expect sales volumes to be broadly flat next month (+1%). Orders placed on suppliers also fell in the year to October (-4%) at a slightly slower pace than September (-9%). Expectations are for a deterioration in orders next month (-22%). Sales for the time of year were poor (-12%), to a similar degree to last month (-11%). Sales are expected to remain poor next month (-10%). Year-on-year internet sales growth improved in October (+49%, from +33% in September). Similar growth is expected pace in November (+51%). These tweets from the CBI show how stockpiling has spiked, even as sales have weakened. Breaking: Stockpiling by UK retailers has hit a record level. The latest survey of Britain\u2019s retail industry, conducted by the CBI, shows that shops brace for Brexit disruption and the peak Christmas shopping season. The CBI found that \u201cstock levels in relation to expected sales\u201d has hit its highest level since the survey began in 1983. Worryingly, shops also reported that retail sales volumes and orders both fell in the year to October for the sixth month in a row. But despite this weakening demand, shops have been cramming their shelves, warehouses and offices to the rafters, in case of Brexit-related disruption. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, says retailers are facing tough times: \u201cRetailers have now endured six months of falling sales, the longest period of decline since the financial crisis. The sector is struggling with ongoing digital disruption, layered on top of cost pressures from a weak pound and the cumulative burden of an outdated business rates regime. \u201cRetailers have also had to contend with the looming Brexit deadline, which has partly driven a record spike in stocks. The timing could not be worse: the run-up to Christmas is a crucial time of year for the retail sector, and not knowing where we will be on November 1st is adding more strain to an already beleaguered sector.\u201d More to follow.... Asia-Pacific stock markets have all closed higher, with Japan touching a one-year peak, amid the trade war optimism. As Stephen Innes of AxiTrader puts it: With indications that the U.S. and China are making more progress in tariff discussions, sentiment continues to turn more favourable. In New York, shares in Microsoft are rallying in pre-market trading after it won a $10bn contract to provide cloud computing services for the Pentagon late last week. But Amazon, who were favourite to claim the contract, are down in pre-market trading -- having already said it was \u201csurprised about this conclusion\u201d. The whole process became mired in allegations of conflict of interests, and also overshadowed by president Trump\u2019s enmity towards Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The European Central Bank are throwing a farewell party for Mario Draghi this afternoon, before he steps down as president on 31 October. But the latest money supply figures, released this morning, have put a dampener on celebrations. Growth in bank lending across the eurozone slowed to 3.7% in September, down from 4.3% in August. This suggests banks are taking credit out of the economy, just as the ECB tries to encourage them to lend more! Growth in money supply - a gauge of future spending and activity - also slowed down last month. Eric Moore, fund manager of FP Miton Income Fund, agrees that the US-China trade war has hurt HSBC, helping to push profits down. He writes: \u201cThere is not much to like in HSBC\u2019s Q3 numbers today. Reported revenues are down 3%, whilst operating expenses are up 2%. The knock-on impact on profits has been severe with reported pre-tax profit down 18%. This runs counter to HSBC\u2019s recent mantra of having \u201cpositive jaws\u201d, that is to say their intention to have revenues growing faster than costs. This is plainly easier when the top line is growing, as there is a certain level of inflation embedded in their cost base. But with interest rates very low everywhere and yield curves very flat it is hard for all banks to deliver revenue growth. Add in the continuing US-China trade dispute and a generalised slowdown in economic growth expectations and HSBC says the \u201coutlook for revenue growth is softer than we anticipated at the half year. Why the pound isn\u2019t higher -&gt; Breaking: European Union leaders have granted the UK a Brexit \u2018flextension\u2019. This gives parliament until 31 January to agree a deal to leave the EU. EC president Donald Tusk has tweeted the decision: The pound has risen very slightly, up to $1.284 against the US dollar (up 0.1% today). HSBC\u2019s travails has dragged the London stock exchange into the red in early trading. The FTSE 100 inex has lost 16 points, or 0.2%, to 7,307. Last week it gained 2.5% in a rally partly driven by the softening pound. Germany\u2019s DAX is up 0.13%, lifted by carmakers (thanks to the trade deal hopes). Volkswagen and BMW have both gained around 1%. France\u2019s CAC has dipped by 0.1%, although LMVH has gained 0.4% as traders welcome its takeover approach to Tiffany. Shares in HSBC have slumped by 4% this morning, after the banking giant issued disappointing financial results. Europe\u2019s biggest bank reported an 18% drop in pretax profits for the last quarter, sending its shares to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Its Return on Tangible Equity figure - a broad measure of profitability - slumped to 6.4% from 10%, forcing HSBC to drop its target of lifting it to 11% next year. HSBC admitted that its performance in parts of continental Europe, the UK and the US were unacceptable; fixing those problems will push up restructuring charges. Interim CEO Noel Quinn didn\u2019t sugar-coat the numbers either, telling shareholders: \u201cParts of our business, especially Asia, held up well in a challenging environment in the third quarter. However, in some parts, performance was not acceptable, principally business activities within continental Europe, the non-ring-fenced bank in the UK, and the US. Our previous plans are no longer sufficient to improve performance for these businesses, given the softer outlook for revenue growth. We are therefore accelerating plans to remodel them, and move capital into higher growth and return opportunities.\u201d All at a time when geopolitical crises are making trading tough. Richard Hunter of Interactive Investors explains: Restructuring charges in the final part of the year are likely to hurt and will be in addition to the current fears of a global economic slowdown following on from the US/China trade spat, political turmoil in Hong Kong and general European economic malaise. There\u2019s not much optimism in Hong Kong this morning. After months of pro-democracy protests, the City state is expected to plunge into recession when the latest GDP figures are released on Thursday. Yesterday, Hong Kong\u2019s financial secretary also warned that the region is unlikely to achieve annual economic growth this year. Paul Chan warned: \u201cThe blow to our economy is comprehensive.\u201d \u201cIt seems it will be extremely difficult for us to reach full-year economic growth of 0 to 1%. I would not rule out the possibility that the full-year economic growth will be negative.\u201d Takeover news: French luxury group LVMH has confirmed it held talks with US rival Tiffany. The company behind the Louis Vuitton fashion house, Moet and Chandon champagne and Hennessy cognac hopes to snaffle Tiffany &amp; Co, for a reported $14.5bn. My colleague Julia Kollewe has more details: LVMH said it had held preliminary discussions with Tiffany, known for its diamond engagement rings, after reports said it had made a $14.5bn bid. It stressed that there was no certainty that a deal would be agreed. LVMH is the world\u2019s largest luxury goods group, with brands including Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Christian Dior and Hublot watches. It is owned by Europe\u2019s richest man, Bernard Arnault. Shares in European car companies have hit their highest levels since May, supported by trade deal optimism. Shares in Chinese tech companies are rocketing this morning, after president Xi Jinping said China intends to invest in blockchain technologies. Xi told a meeting of top Communist party officials that blockchain (the technology underpinning bitcoin) would play \u201can important role in the next round of technological innovation and industrial transformation\u201d. Xi also chaired a study session last week on developing China\u2019s crypo industry. Shares in Chinese companies with a focus on blockchain, such as DHC Software, have surged by 10% - the maximum one-day move allowed. Trade war optimism has pushed Japan\u2019s Nikkei index to a one-year high today. Investors piled into globally-focused companies, on hopes that a US-China trade deal would spur growth. Reuters has more details: Lifting the mood were comments from U.S. and Chinese officials that they are \u201cclose to finalizing\u201d some parts of a trade agreement after high-level telephone discussions on Friday. Traders reacted quickly by buying shares perceived to be sensitive to global economic cycles, including semi-conductor chip-related shares and shipping firms. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are starting the week in good heart, as Washington and Beijing inch towards a \u2018phase one\u2019 trade deal. U.S. and Chinese officials have both said they are \u201cclose to finalizing\u201d some parts of a preliminary trade agreement, following a high-level phone call on Friday. China\u2019s commerce ministry says that technical talks about the phase 1 trade deal text with the US is \u201cbasically completed\u201d. Both sides have agreed to properly address core issues, it says. And there\u2019s also a mini-breakthough: The US has agreed to import cooked poultry from China, while Beijing will lift a ban on U.S. poultry. This has driven Asia-Pacific stocks to a three-month high this morning, with gains in China (+0.7%), Japan (+0.3%) and South Korea (+0.2%). The US trade representative has also said that the two sides are \u201cclose to finalising some sections\u201d of an interim agreement to ease trade tensions between the two countries, following that call between Robert Lighthizer, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, and China\u2019s vice-president Liu He. Lighthizer\u2019s office added that the negotiators \u201cmade headway on specific issues\u201d. But investors shouldn\u2019t, ahem, count their chickens yet. A \u2018Phase One\u2019 trade deal could mean that planned US tariffs on Chinese goods aren\u2019t imposed in December, which could boost trade and economic growth. Donald Trump is very keen to sign such a deal when he meets China\u2019s Xi Jinping next month, at the Apec meeting in Chile in November. However, this would only be a stepping stone towards a comprehensive deal, which could take much longer.... Also coming up today The pound is hovering around $1.282 this morning, as EU leaders prepare to agree to a Brexit extension -- probably to 31 January. In Westminster, prime minister Boris Johnson will make another push for a general election in December, but Labour are expected to block him again. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group says the pound would weaken if EU leaders only granted a short delay. As it stands today, the probability of a no-deal Brexit is very slim. From the market perspective, a no-deal scenario is almost fully reflected in sterling prices near the 1.30 mark against the US dollar. Pound traders have further trimmed their net short positions during the week that ended on October 22nd and have already moved on to pricing Britain\u2019s next political challenges. The agenda 11am GMT: CBI survey of UK retail sales in September 12.30pm GMT: US trade date for September 3pm GMT: ECB president Mario Draghi speaks at a \u2018farewell event\u2019 before his term ends this week",

After all, what goes up must come down \u2013 but it may be the addition of Andonovski, who leaves a coaching gig in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, that can help the USWNT defy physics for a little while longer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/25/high-school-soccer-team-equal-pay-burlington\">\u2018It\u2019s blown us away\u2019: how high school soccer team\u2019s equal pay push caught fire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, it\u2019s important to understand why the job opened up for Andonovski. Ellis stepped down after leading the US to two Women\u2019s World Cup titles, but the less-discussed aspect of her tenure is a disastrous run through the 2016 Olympics, where the US suffered its earliest exit in a major tournament in the history of the team. Ellis\u2019s reasoning for stepping away <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/jill-ellis-stepping-down-uswnt-coach\">hasn\u2019t been terribly specific</a>, but surely going out on top and avoiding the tarnish of another Olympic setback played a factor.</p> <p>Now, the short turnaround to the 2020 Olympics, only nine months away, becomes Andonovski\u2019s problem.</p> <p>But if there\u2019s a coach who could step in under such circumstances, it\u2019s probably Andonovski, who has spent the past six years working with the USWNT player pool via the NWSL. He won two NWSL championships with FC Kansas City, and last week was named this season\u2019s NWSL coach of the year for his impressive work with an injury-riddled Reign in Seattle, where he had to field more than 30 players and the team still made playoffs.</p> <p>But for anyone who hasn\u2019t been watching the NWSL on a regular basis, Andonovski is a name that may feel like it\u2019s arrived out of nowhere.

      "bodyText": "How do you take the reins from a manager who has won consecutive World Cups? That\u2019s the unenviable position Vlatko Andonovski finds himself in. Andonovski was named Monday as the new coach of US women\u2019s national team, taking over for Jill Ellis, who stepped down last month \u2013 and he arrives at a time when the two-time reigning World Cup champions seem due for regression. After all, what goes up must come down \u2013 but it may be the addition of Andonovski, who leaves a coaching gig in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, that can help the USWNT defy physics for a little while longer. First, it\u2019s important to understand why the job opened up for Andonovski. Ellis stepped down after leading the US to two Women\u2019s World Cup titles, but the less-discussed aspect of her tenure is a disastrous run through the 2016 Olympics, where the US suffered its earliest exit in a major tournament in the history of the team. Ellis\u2019s reasoning for stepping away hasn\u2019t been terribly specific, but surely going out on top and avoiding the tarnish of another Olympic setback played a factor. Now, the short turnaround to the 2020 Olympics, only nine months away, becomes Andonovski\u2019s problem. But if there\u2019s a coach who could step in under such circumstances, it\u2019s probably Andonovski, who has spent the past six years working with the USWNT player pool via the NWSL. He won two NWSL championships with FC Kansas City, and last week was named this season\u2019s NWSL coach of the year for his impressive work with an injury-riddled Reign in Seattle, where he had to field more than 30 players and the team still made playoffs. But for anyone who hasn\u2019t been watching the NWSL on a regular basis, Andonovski is a name that may feel like it\u2019s arrived out of nowhere. After all, he has no international management experience \u2013 not even at the youth level \u2013 and it\u2019s been a meteoric rise for the 43-year-old Macedonian who no one outside of Kansas City had heard of until a few years ago. In 2000, he arrived in the United States speaking little English to play professional indoor soccer, and he ended up at the Kansas City Comets, where he\u2019d finish his playing career. In 2012, when the Comets ownership group launched a team in the new National Women\u2019s Soccer League called FC Kansas City, they asked Andonovski to coach it. Some USWNT players actively opposed being allocated there because they hadn\u2019t heard of Andonovski and weren\u2019t sure what kind of coach he\u2019d be. But he quickly established himself as a tactically smart coach who pushed his teams to play aesthetically attractive possession football while managing the personalities in the locker room. His players rave about how he made them better. Megan Rapinoe, the reigning best player in the world, has said he\u2019s something of a tactical mastermind, quick to adapt when necessary, but that he excels at helping players understand what he wants and convincing them to buy in. After veterans on the US women\u2019s national team tried unsuccessfully to get Ellis fired before the World Cup in France, and none of them offered any kind parting words for Ellis in her final days on otherwise active social media accounts, it appears the players are getting what they want with Andonovski. The coach search was led by general manager Kate Markgraf but player input was weighed heavily, and Andonovski was the top pick amongst the USWNT core. Andonovski can be intense as a coach.

Recommended reads Tracy Sorenson is voting No 1 galah in the bird of the year poll, and here\u2019s why: \u201cI was about five years old when my parents acquired the baby girl galah with her pink eyes, vigorous dance moves, biting potential and propensity for ear-splitting loudness. She learned to call \u2018DEBBEH! DEBBEH!\u2019, copying my mother trying to get the attention of my sister, Deb. She made a dock-dock-dock noise which we finally worked out was the sound of ladies\u2019 shoes on the concrete floor as they passed her cage on the way to the toilet during fittings (Mum was a dressmaker).

      "body": "<p>It was not where the People\u2019s Vote campaign wanted to be on the eve of a crucial week in parliament that could determine the fate of Brexit and 10 days after hundreds of thousands took to the streets to demand a second referendum.</p> <p>Two of its senior executives \u2013 James McGrory and Tom Baldwin \u2013 had been fired, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/28/peoples-vote-senior-figures-forced-out\">dozens of staff staged a walkout from their Millbank offices</a>, and work had to be carried on first in the Tate Britain cafe, then later in a pub near the Thames.</p> <p>McGrory and Baldwin, the campaigns and communications director respectively, are not going away without a battle, and staff are pushing for them to be reinstated. But to get their positions back they have to go head-to-head with Roland Rudd, the powerful City PR guru who effectively controls the campaign through the Open Britain organisation.</p> <p>Rudd, a multimillionaire businessman and the brother of the Conservative former cabinet minister Amber Rudd, is one of the godfathers of the 2016 remain campaign, having co-founded the Britain Stronger in Europe group that turned into the official coordinating body. He later went on to chair its successor organisation, Open Britain, which now effectively controls the movement for a People\u2019s Vote.</p> <p>People\u2019s Vote is an umbrella alliance, with five groups supporting its aim of a second referendum. But Open Britain is by far the biggest, employing almost all the staff, owning most of the data on supporters, renting the offices and owning the equipment. Rudd, its chairman, also says he is chair of People\u2019s Vote, although that is disputed by his opponents.</p> <p>Sources on both sides of the hostilities say rows have been raging for months, but there is little agreement about whether the root cause of the argument is a power struggle over resources or more of an ideological division about the future of the second referendum movement.</p> <p>One person familiar with all the parties said the fallout began when Rudd began to install his allies on the board, with Peter Mandelson and others trying to stop him taking control. In his next step in the battle, Rudd is expected to make moves to remove Lord Mandelson and his allies \u2013 two former remain campaign executives, Will Straw and Joe Carberry \u2013 from the board of Open Britain.</p> <p>Anger among senior staff also boiled over when another friend of Rudd, Hugo Dixon, was made deputy chair of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, and began organising a semi-rival March for Change that they felt cut across some of the organisation\u2019s aims.</p> <p>One senior figure still involved in the campaign, who knows all parties, said his belief was that \u201cRoland is a frustrated politician\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s very pleased with his success in business. But it\u2019s never been enough. He\u2019s desperate to be acknowledged publicly. It\u2019s a combination of pique, <em><a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amour%20propre\">amour propre</a></em> and a desperation for publicity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But other staffers say it is more of a battle over fundamental ideology, with wrangling about the soul of a future in campaign. They place Rudd on the side of \u201cstarry-eyed remainiacs\u201d, saying he wants to form an alliance with other pro-EU groups and potentially even help bring about a realignment of centrist politics around the Lib Dems.</p> <p>On the other side, the current executive team have been focused on winning the practical arguments for a second referendum in the country and trying to get more soft Tories and Labour figures on board in parliament.</p> <p>But allies of Rudd say this characterisation is rubbish and a \u201csmokescreen\u201d for explaining away problems with the current structure. They also point to previous efforts by Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, the former communications director to Tony Blair, to get rid of Rudd, saying that had pushed him into this course of action. A rival plan pushed by the Mandelson group would have put Michael Heseltine, Dominic Grieve and Margaret Beckett in senior roles.</p> <p>In an email to staff, Rudd referred to a need to make the campaign \u201cmore professional and more in touch\u201d. While thanking McGrory and Baldwin, he said: \u201cAs you will all understand, the ongoing internal issues in the campaign have been allowed to carry on for too long. We now need a much clearer structure as we move forward.\u201d He said the appointment of Patrick Heneghan to replace them would \u201ctake the organisation to the next level\u201d.</p> <p>Supporters of McGrory, a former spinner for Nick Clegg and the remain campaign, and Baldwin, a former director of media for Ed Miliband, are not sure where the battle will go next. They are planning to turn up at the office on Tuesday, where some staff are expected to argue for the sacked pair to get their jobs back.</p> <p>However, Rudd effectively has power over Open Britain, with majority support on the board, and control over it via a new company called Baybridge. Those familiar with his thinking say the ultimate aim is for Open Britain to merge with other pro-EU groups such as Best for Britain and the European Movement to form a more structured campaign to remain in the EU.</p> <p>MPs involved in the People\u2019s Vote campaign are baffled by the developments. It was originally launched in spring 2018 by a cross-party lineup of MPs who took to the stage at the Electric Ballroom in Camden, north London, including then Conservative Anna Soubry, Chuka Umunna, then with Labour, the Greens\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/caroline-lucas\">Caroline Lucas</a> and Liberal Democrat Layla Moran.</p> <p>One prominent MP who supports the People\u2019s Vote said they were \u201csimply sad\u201d at the wrangling, but MPs would be focusing on building support in parliament for a second referendum. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually need People\u2019s Vote for now, when we are just trying to get parliament and the parties to back a second referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will need the data when there\u2019s an actual remain campaign to be fought. They\u2019d better get their act together by then.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was not where the People\u2019s Vote campaign wanted to be on the eve of a crucial week in parliament that could determine the fate of Brexit and 10 days after hundreds of thousands took to the streets to demand a second referendum. Two of its senior executives \u2013 James McGrory and Tom Baldwin \u2013 had been fired, dozens of staff staged a walkout from their Millbank offices, and work had to be carried on first in the Tate Britain cafe, then later in a pub near the Thames. McGrory and Baldwin, the campaigns and communications director respectively, are not going away without a battle, and staff are pushing for them to be reinstated. But to get their positions back they have to go head-to-head with Roland Rudd, the powerful City PR guru who effectively controls the campaign through the Open Britain organisation. Rudd, a multimillionaire businessman and the brother of the Conservative former cabinet minister Amber Rudd, is one of the godfathers of the 2016 remain campaign, having co-founded the Britain Stronger in Europe group that turned into the official coordinating body. He later went on to chair its successor organisation, Open Britain, which now effectively controls the movement for a People\u2019s Vote. People\u2019s Vote is an umbrella alliance, with five groups supporting its aim of a second referendum. But Open Britain is by far the biggest, employing almost all the staff, owning most of the data on supporters, renting the offices and owning the equipment. Rudd, its chairman, also says he is chair of People\u2019s Vote, although that is disputed by his opponents. Sources on both sides of the hostilities say rows have been raging for months, but there is little agreement about whether the root cause of the argument is a power struggle over resources or more of an ideological division about the future of the second referendum movement. One person familiar with all the parties said the fallout began when Rudd began to install his allies on the board, with Peter Mandelson and others trying to stop him taking control. In his next step in the battle, Rudd is expected to make moves to remove Lord Mandelson and his allies \u2013 two former remain campaign executives, Will Straw and Joe Carberry \u2013 from the board of Open Britain. Anger among senior staff also boiled over when another friend of Rudd, Hugo Dixon, was made deputy chair of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, and began organising a semi-rival March for Change that they felt cut across some of the organisation\u2019s aims. One senior figure still involved in the campaign, who knows all parties, said his belief was that \u201cRoland is a frustrated politician\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s very pleased with his success in business. But it\u2019s never been enough. He\u2019s desperate to be acknowledged publicly. It\u2019s a combination of pique, amour propre and a desperation for publicity,\u201d he said. But other staffers say it is more of a battle over fundamental ideology, with wrangling about the soul of a future in campaign. They place Rudd on the side of \u201cstarry-eyed remainiacs\u201d, saying he wants to form an alliance with other pro-EU groups and potentially even help bring about a realignment of centrist politics around the Lib Dems. On the other side, the current executive team have been focused on winning the practical arguments for a second referendum in the country and trying to get more soft Tories and Labour figures on board in parliament. But allies of Rudd say this characterisation is rubbish and a \u201csmokescreen\u201d for explaining away problems with the current structure. They also point to previous efforts by Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, the former communications director to Tony Blair, to get rid of Rudd, saying that had pushed him into this course of action. A rival plan pushed by the Mandelson group would have put Michael Heseltine, Dominic Grieve and Margaret Beckett in senior roles. In an email to staff, Rudd referred to a need to make the campaign \u201cmore professional and more in touch\u201d. While thanking McGrory and Baldwin, he said: \u201cAs you will all understand, the ongoing internal issues in the campaign have been allowed to carry on for too long. We now need a much clearer structure as we move forward.\u201d He said the appointment of Patrick Heneghan to replace them would \u201ctake the organisation to the next level\u201d. Supporters of McGrory, a former spinner for Nick Clegg and the remain campaign, and Baldwin, a former director of media for Ed Miliband, are not sure where the battle will go next. They are planning to turn up at the office on Tuesday, where some staff are expected to argue for the sacked pair to get their jobs back. However, Rudd effectively has power over Open Britain, with majority support on the board, and control over it via a new company called Baybridge. Those familiar with his thinking say the ultimate aim is for Open Britain to merge with other pro-EU groups such as Best for Britain and the European Movement to form a more structured campaign to remain in the EU. MPs involved in the People\u2019s Vote campaign are baffled by the developments. It was originally launched in spring 2018 by a cross-party lineup of MPs who took to the stage at the Electric Ballroom in Camden, north London, including then Conservative Anna Soubry, Chuka Umunna, then with Labour, the Greens\u2019 Caroline Lucas and Liberal Democrat Layla Moran. One prominent MP who supports the People\u2019s Vote said they were \u201csimply sad\u201d at the wrangling, but MPs would be focusing on building support in parliament for a second referendum. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually need People\u2019s Vote for now, when we are just trying to get parliament and the parties to back a second referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will need the data when there\u2019s an actual remain campaign to be fought. They\u2019d better get their act together by then.\u201d",

Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters that the results will be checked against the lists of missing people both in the capital and across the country. A number of the skulls were found arranged within a kind of altar. Police also seized 40 jaw bones, as well as 30 leg and arm bones, and a fetus in a glass jar. Photographs distributed by the authorities showed the altar also featured a cross, wooden masks, knives, and a large picture of what appears to be a horned goat in front of a pyramid. The find is not necessarily an indication of murder in a country where popular culture provides for a vast range of different relationships with the dead. All over the country people flock to cemeteries during Day of the Dead celebrations around 1 November to decorate, and often party, over the graves of their loved ones. In the indigenous Mayan community of Pomuch, in the southern state of Campeche, the tradition includes families digging up the bones of their relatives and giving them a clean.

An analysis by the Guardian has shown that the left slate is currently ahead and likely to win several more candidate selections in the next two weeks. Despite a surge for the party\u2019s centrists over the weekend, with several unexpected wins in the Midlands and north of England, Momentum said the left was providing the \u201cnew generation\u201d of potential MPs for the Labour party. Claims of centrally organised \u201cstitch-ups\u201d by the office of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, have dominated selection battles so far. Concerns have been raised that local candidates are being deliberately left off longlists created by the national executive committee in favour of people on the left with a national profile, but the party denies this is the case. A Momentum spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re very happy to see a new generation of leftwing MP candidates being selected in safe Labour seats across the country. \u201cThis is down to the hard graft of local activists and the widespread support among grassroots Labour members for a new generation of leftwing MPs committed to backing a radical, transformative agenda when in government.\u201d Of the 33 seats where a new Labour candidate must be chosen due to the sitting MP retiring, defecting to another party or currently being under suspension, so far 12 seats have gone to a Momentum-backed candidate, compared with seven for centrists. Over the weekend, those opposing Corbyn\u2019s leadership hailed the result for the ultra-safe seat of Vauxhall in south London, where Corbyn\u2019s former political secretary Katy Clark was heavily outvoted in favour of Florence Eshalomi, the London assembly member for Lambeth and Southwark. In leave-voting Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, a remain-backing former London councillor, Sally Gimson, won the selection ahead of two leftwing challengers. The Momentum-backed candidate in Blyth Valley, Northumberland, also missed out to a local government figure. Elsewhere in non-Labour-held seats, Momentum\u2019s vice-chair Emina Ibrahim lost to a local councillor in Finchley and Golders Green, north London, to challenge the sitting Tory Mike Freer, and ex-Labour MP Luciana Berger, who is now standing for the Liberal Democrats in the seat. Luke Akehurst, secretary of the centre-left group Labour First, said: \u201cIf Labour returns the same number of MPs, the hard left could get a minimum of 44 MPs, and a maximum of 55. \u201cThey are not going to have to worry about not getting their leadership candidate on the ballot paper, which is a big moral thing for them, but it\u2019s hardly the dramatic reshaping of the parliamentary Labour party that they dreamt of.\u201d He said the centre-left side of the party had had success in Ashfield, Bassetlaw, Blyth Valley, Cynon Valley, Enfield North, Vauxhall and Ynys M\u00f4n so far. In Poplar and Limehouse, east London, the Met police were called to the selection ballot after people said they felt intimidated as hundreds of party members tried to pour into a church to vote. According to reports in the Evening Standard, hundreds of people turned out to vote for Corbyn supporter and Momentum-backed Apsana Begum following the retirement of longstanding MP Jim Fitzpatrick. Video footage showed people cramming to get into St Paul\u2019s church in Bow Common. The party said it was confident the process had been run correctly. A Labour insider from the soft-left wing of the party said the five results from over the weekend show that the grip of Karie Murphy, Corbyn\u2019s former chief of staff who has been seconded to oversee the party\u2019s general election campaign, was weakening. They said: \u201cKarie Murphy\u2019s grip is slipping.

The campaign for a second referendum is set for a showdown on Tuesday morning after around 35 staff walked out in support of James McGrory, the campaign director, and Tom Baldwin, the communications director, who were fired by email by Rudd over the weekend.

      "bodyText": "In a dramatic comeback, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, one of Argentina\u2019s most popular presidents during her two terms from 2007 to 2015, has been voted back into office as vice-president. A large crowd of supporters burst into a roar outside the Frente de Todos (Everybody\u2019s Front) party bunker in the Chacarita neighbourhood of the capital Buenos Aires on Sunday night, when preliminary official results gave the victory to the centre-left presidential candidate Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and his running mate Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. Fern\u00e1ndez, who assumes office on 10 December, arrived at the presidential palace on Monday for a meeting with the outgoing incumbent, Mauricio Macri, to discuss the potentially tricky transition of power. The victory puts an end to the pro-business economic policies of Macri\u2019s administration, who promised \u201czero poverty\u201d during his electoral campaign but exits office with a plunging peso, an inflation rate that rocketed to an annual 56%, and the number of people living beneath the poverty line having risen from 29% to 35%. Conceding defeat on Sunday, Macri told his supporters: \u201cWe need an orderly transition that will bring tranquility to all Argentinians, because the most important thing is the wellbeing of all Argentinians.\u201d With more than 90% of ballots counted, Fern\u00e1ndez, no relation to Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, had 47.79% of the vote, compared with Macri\u2019s 40.71%. Fern\u00e1ndez is a moderate Peronist who has pledged to respect the $57bn IMF loan taken out by Macri last year to try and salvage Argentina\u2019s creaking economy while promising to improve wages and benefits for workers and pensioners. His victory was widely expected, and car horns started sounding nonstop in Buenos Aires after polling booths closed at 6pm on Sunday. In one quiet neighbourhood, a group of bicycle delivery workers\u2013 one of the few job opportunities available for young people during Macri\u2019s administration \u2013 rode through the streets tinkling their bells ecstatically to celebrate the end of his government. Argentina\u2019s elections, traditionally held the last Sunday of October, coincided this year with the ninth anniversary of the death from a sudden heart attack of N\u00e9stor Kirchner, the husband and predecessor in office of Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. During his 2003-2007 administration, Kirchner led Argentina\u2019s recovery from its economic collapse and monumental foreign debt default in 2001-02. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner served as president from 2007 to 2015. By the time she left office she was entangled in a string of court cases involving accusations of bribery, money laundering, corruption and allegations that she had helped cover up Iran\u2019s involvement in a terrorist bombing that prosecutor was investigating. Some of the corruption cases are continuing. She denies any wrongdoing. The memory of the period of sustained economic growth in the 2000s, during which time Fern\u00e1ndez was the cabinet chief, played an important part in the election campaign. Reflecting his confidence in an easy win, Fern\u00e1ndez, an amateur musician who enjoys hanging out with rock stars, spent a relaxed Saturday afternoon playing the guitar and singing 1960s and 70s Argentinian rock songs with Gustavo Santaolalla, the Argentinian musician who won two consecutive Academy Awards for Brokeback Mountain and Babel. A short video of the impromptu jam uploaded by Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s spokesman, Juan Pablo Biondi, soon reached over 170,000 views on Twitter. On Saturday, Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner visited her husband\u2019s mausoleum in the Patagonian city of R\u00edo Gallegos, and on Sunday at midday she was greeted by a large adoring crowd at the polling booth. \u201cThis is such an important day for democracy,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner said to journalists after voting. Future regional tensions were immediately on show as the far-right administration of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil hit out at the leftist\u2019s victory. Speaking in Abu Dhabi, Bolsonaro declined to congratulate Argentina\u2019s president-elect, telling reporters: \u201cArgentina has chosen badly.\u201d Bolsonaro\u2019s foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, went further, warning in a series of tweets that Argentina\u2019s new leaders would usher in an era of \u201cretrograde\u201d economic policies and support for dictatorships. \u201cThe indications are the worst possible \u2026 The forces of evil are celebrating,\u201d Ara\u00fajo said.",

Baghdadi, the latest leader of so-called Islamic State, had made a name for his group with a murderous reign of terror culminating in the shock fall of the city of Mosul into his hands a fortnight earlier. His claims about \u201ccrushing the idol of democracy\u201d and defeating \u201cagents of the crusaders and atheists, and the guards of the Jews\u201d were followed by a campaign of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_of_Yazidis_by_ISIL\" title=\"\">genocide</a>, slavery, rape and ultra-violence against <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2016/0706/In-Ramadan-attacks-ISIS-reveals-its-top-target-other-Muslims\" title=\"\">Muslims</a> primarily. Baghdadi\u2019s empire-building came to nothing when the \u201ccaliphate\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/23/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-isis-caliphate\" title=\"\">collapsed</a> in March this year. The world\u2019s most-wanted terrorist ended his life as a fugitive who decided that he would kill himself rather than surrender to justice. He came to an ignominious end; reportedly cornered by US special forces, Baghdadi blew himself up in a tunnel in Syria, killing three of his children as well.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Donald Trump could not resist the opportunity to make a series of questionable statements and promote himself.

      "bodyText": "At the end of June 2014 Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was announced as a caliph of all Muslims in a declaration that not only proclaimed a new \u201ccaliphate\u201d, but also warned fellow believers in Islam that they must \u201cpledge allegiance and support\u201d. Baghdadi, the latest leader of so-called Islamic State, had made a name for his group with a murderous reign of terror culminating in the shock fall of the city of Mosul into his hands a fortnight earlier. His claims about \u201ccrushing the idol of democracy\u201d and defeating \u201cagents of the crusaders and atheists, and the guards of the Jews\u201d were followed by a campaign of genocide, slavery, rape and ultra-violence against Muslims primarily. Baghdadi\u2019s empire-building came to nothing when the \u201ccaliphate\u201d collapsed in March this year. The world\u2019s most-wanted terrorist ended his life as a fugitive who decided that he would kill himself rather than surrender to justice. He came to an ignominious end; reportedly cornered by US special forces, Baghdadi blew himself up in a tunnel in Syria, killing three of his children as well. Unfortunately, Donald Trump could not resist the opportunity to make a series of questionable statements and promote himself. His claim that Baghdadi \u201cdied like a dog\u201d was unpleasant, unnecessary and will cause unintended problems for the United States that will require undoing, especially in the Muslim world where canines are considered unclean. It would help first to get the facts straight, instead of shrouding them in the \u201cfog of war\u201d. When Osama bin Laden was killed under the Obama administration in 2011, days after the event it had to offer an account that contradicted its previous assertions. There\u2019s good reason to expect that the Trump White House might have to correct a few self-serving myths in the coming days. The fact that Baghdadi took his own life means that the policy of killing members of terrorist groups as part of America\u2019s war on terror continues without the necessary and long overdue debate about the ethics and legality of targeted assassinations. The US will need all the help it can get to defeat terrorism in the Middle East. The death of Baghdadi is a blow to Isis but not a mortal one. Following the loss of its citadels, it had become a loose, decentralised series of terrorist groupuscules, which allow followers to carry out its violent ideology on their own.

      "body": "<p>Robert Evans, who has died aged 89, was an extravagant film producer whose exciting, glamorous and sometimes grotesque life threatened frequently to overshadow the movies he made. As head of production at Paramount Pictures in the late 1960s and early 70s, the former actor was responsible for reviving the fortunes of that moribund studio by overseeing hits such as Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1968), Love Story (1970), The Godfather (1972) and Chinatown (1974).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/28/robert-evans-celebrated-hollywood-producer-of-chinatown-dies-aged-89\">Robert Evans, celebrated Hollywood producer of Chinatown, dies aged 89</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was no shortage of stories to feed Evans\u2019s larger-than-life image. He cherished and bragged about his friendships with Henry Kissinger, Warren Beatty and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/26/obituary-ted-kennedy\" title=\"\">Ted Kennedy</a>. He lived in a 16-room Regency house in Beverly Hills and dispatched bottles of Dom P\u00e9rignon as quickly as he got through sexual partners.</p> <p>According to Peter Biskind\u2019s 1998 account of 70s Hollywood, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, a housekeeper would bring Evans breakfast in bed each morning accompanied by a piece of paper on which she had written the name of whichever woman happened to be lying beside him. He was married seven times, most famously in 1969 to Ali MacGraw, the star of Love Story, who left him four years later for Steve McQueen. One marriage, to the actor Catherine Oxenberg, lasted for only 12 days.</p> <p>This life of excess, including an addiction to cocaine, eventually ruined Evans\u2019s career: he went from being worth $11m in 1979 to having $37 to his name 10 years later. In 1980, he was given a suspended prison sentence for cocaine trafficking. As part of his plea bargain, he agreed to make an anti-drugs public information message.</p> <p>What started as a commercial became a week of star-studded TV specials instigated by Evans. He ploughed $400,000 of his own money into the campaign, which included the tuneless, anodyne celebrity singalong <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5xBwOSVYfg\" title=\"\">Get High on Yourself</a>.

In 1983, Evans\u2019s life spilled over from the showbusiness pages to the crime ones when he became a suspect in the murder of the producer and promoter <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/13/nyregion/california-body-identified-as-that-of-missing-producer.html\" title=\"\">Roy Radin</a>, who was involved with him in a co-financing deal on the expensive flop The Cotton Club (1984).</p> <p>Evans got his producing career temporarily back on track in the mid-90s, even returning to a deal at Paramount, but suffered a series of strokes in 1998 which restricted dramatically his mobility.</p> <p>Even this setback could not keep him down, and he returned to the limelight in 2003 to narrate a popular documentary about himself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/07/artsfeatures5\" title=\"\">The Kid Stays in the Picture</a>, which shared its title with his own bestselling 1994 autobiography.</p> <p>Those words had first come from the mouth of the producer Darryl F Zanuck, who had cast Evans as the bullfighter Pedro Romero in a 1957 adaptation of Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises. Ten days before shooting started, Zanuck received a signed petition from the rest of the cast, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/14/ava-gardner-screen-legend\" title=\"\">Ava Gardner</a> and Tyrone Power, asking him to remove Evans from the film. It read: \u201cWith Robert Evans playing Pedro Romero, The Sun Also Rises will be a disaster.\u201d Zanuck arrived on set and told the assembled cast and crew: \u201cThe kid stays in the picture.

When he and MacGraw split, for example, he reports Kissinger telling him: \u201cIf I can negotiate with the North Vietnamese, I think I can smooth the way with Ali.\u201d To which Evans replies: \u201cHenry, you know countries, you don\u2019t know women. When it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the book\u2019s stories were later contested, including Evans\u2019s claim that he helped Mario Puzo in 1968 with the \u201crumpled pages\u201d that eventually became The Godfather. (Puzo claimed not to have met Evans at that stage.) But then Evans usually had the monopoly on telling his own story. When asked for a comment on him, the Chinatown screenwriter Robert Towne replied: \u201cWhy? Why bother? Bob says it all himself.\u201d</p> <p>He was born Robert J Shapera in New York City \u2013 \u201cthe J sounding good but standing for nothing I knew of\u201d. His father, Archie Shapera, was a dentist who had a clinic in Harlem, while his mother, Florence, raised Robert and his brother, Charles, and sister, Alice; it was wealth from Florence\u2019s family that accounted for Evans\u2019s privileged upbringing on the city\u2019s Upper West Side.</p> <p>He was educated at Joan of Arc junior high school, the Bronx high school of science and Haaren high school, and was auditioning for acting roles from the age of 12. (He claimed to have had more than 300 parts on radio as a child.) He put this career on hold and became a disc jockey, a clothing model and a salesman.

      "bodyText": "Robert Evans, who has died aged 89, was an extravagant film producer whose exciting, glamorous and sometimes grotesque life threatened frequently to overshadow the movies he made. As head of production at Paramount Pictures in the late 1960s and early 70s, the former actor was responsible for reviving the fortunes of that moribund studio by overseeing hits such as Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1968), Love Story (1970), The Godfather (1972) and Chinatown (1974). There was no shortage of stories to feed Evans\u2019s larger-than-life image. He cherished and bragged about his friendships with Henry Kissinger, Warren Beatty and Ted Kennedy. He lived in a 16-room Regency house in Beverly Hills and dispatched bottles of Dom P\u00e9rignon as quickly as he got through sexual partners. According to Peter Biskind\u2019s 1998 account of 70s Hollywood, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, a housekeeper would bring Evans breakfast in bed each morning accompanied by a piece of paper on which she had written the name of whichever woman happened to be lying beside him. He was married seven times, most famously in 1969 to Ali MacGraw, the star of Love Story, who left him four years later for Steve McQueen. One marriage, to the actor Catherine Oxenberg, lasted for only 12 days. This life of excess, including an addiction to cocaine, eventually ruined Evans\u2019s career: he went from being worth $11m in 1979 to having $37 to his name 10 years later. In 1980, he was given a suspended prison sentence for cocaine trafficking. As part of his plea bargain, he agreed to make an anti-drugs public information message. What started as a commercial became a week of star-studded TV specials instigated by Evans. He ploughed $400,000 of his own money into the campaign, which included the tuneless, anodyne celebrity singalong Get High on Yourself. He later admitted that he was still taking cocaine while this media blitz was under way. He had always idolised and fraternised with gangsters (he was close friends with the mob lawyer and Hollywood \u201cfixer\u201d Sidney Korshak). In 1983, Evans\u2019s life spilled over from the showbusiness pages to the crime ones when he became a suspect in the murder of the producer and promoter Roy Radin, who was involved with him in a co-financing deal on the expensive flop The Cotton Club (1984). Evans got his producing career temporarily back on track in the mid-90s, even returning to a deal at Paramount, but suffered a series of strokes in 1998 which restricted dramatically his mobility. Even this setback could not keep him down, and he returned to the limelight in 2003 to narrate a popular documentary about himself, The Kid Stays in the Picture, which shared its title with his own bestselling 1994 autobiography. Those words had first come from the mouth of the producer Darryl F Zanuck, who had cast Evans as the bullfighter Pedro Romero in a 1957 adaptation of Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises. Ten days before shooting started, Zanuck received a signed petition from the rest of the cast, including Ava Gardner and Tyrone Power, asking him to remove Evans from the film. It read: \u201cWith Robert Evans playing Pedro Romero, The Sun Also Rises will be a disaster.\u201d Zanuck arrived on set and told the assembled cast and crew: \u201cThe kid stays in the picture. And anybody who doesn\u2019t like it can quit!\u201d Evans credited that moment with teaching him to stick to his guns when he became a producer. Of course, we only have his word for what happened, and the autobiography is knowingly hyperbolic, written in the hard-boiled, cornball slang of a dime-store detective novel. When he and MacGraw split, for example, he reports Kissinger telling him: \u201cIf I can negotiate with the North Vietnamese, I think I can smooth the way with Ali.\u201d To which Evans replies: \u201cHenry, you know countries, you don\u2019t know women. When it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over.\u201d Some of the book\u2019s stories were later contested, including Evans\u2019s claim that he helped Mario Puzo in 1968 with the \u201crumpled pages\u201d that eventually became The Godfather. (Puzo claimed not to have met Evans at that stage.) But then Evans usually had the monopoly on telling his own story.

At 20, he started a successful women\u2019s fashion business, Evan Picone, with his brother. But acting beckoned him back unexpectedly, when he was approached at a hotel swimming pool by Norma Shearer, who asked him to play her late husband, Irving J Thalberg, in the film Man of a Thousand Faces (1957). He accepted and she coached him obsessively on every aspect of his performance. He also starred in The Fiend Who Walked the West (1958) and The Best of Everything (1959), before his confidence took a knock when he lost out to Warren Beatty for the male lead in The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone (1961). He went back to fashion and made a fortune when Revlon bought his business. He used the windfall to pursue an ambition to become a producer, paying a friend, George Weiser, who worked at Publishers Weekly, to tip him off about any hot literary properties that were about to hit the shelves. Evans had his first decisive success in that field when he snapped up Roderick Thorp\u2019s novel The Detective, which was adapted by 20th Century Fox into a film starring Frank Sinatra.

      "bodyText": "The actors\u2019 union Equity has called for more casting directors to consider hiring transgender performers to play non-trans characters. In guidance for entertainment professionals working with LGBT+ performers, published on Monday, the union said some trans actors were better suited to playing characters who were cisgender \u2013 meaning their gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth. \u201cThe fact that [a performer] is trans may be completely invisible in the role or production, but it powerfully represents diversity in the industry,\u201d it said. \u201cThis \u2018invisible\u2019 diversity is just as important as more physically recognisable forms of diversity.\u201d It added: \u201cIt is hard for trans actors to build a career out of the very small amount of trans-specific roles if these are the only roles for which they are actively sought.\u201d At a launch event for the guidance at the National Theatre, Tigger Blaize, the vice-chair of Equity\u2019s LGBT+ committee, said the advice was designed to \u201chelp you to help us\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to bash anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a new area to many and it\u2019s OK to make mistakes.\u201d The union\u2019s guidance says it should be standard industry practice for people to introduce themselves with both their name and preferred pronoun. It advises asking performers what pronouns they prefer, rather than assuming. \u201cIf you make a mistake, apologise, correct and move on. No dramas,\u201d it reads.

      "body": "<p>Before we explore the unglamorous roots of this story, James Milner captures the pain and glory of losing and winning a Champions League final and sails through the ebbs and flows of a Premier League career that has lasted 17 years so far. He voices his contempt for VAR and celebrates his insistence on talking in Spanish to his children. Milner also reveals that he and Andy Robertson, his Liverpool teammate, have used a sleep-talking app \u2013 which proves that Milner speaks in Spanish while asleep.</p> <p>These topics are addressed in an entertaining book called <a href=\"https://www.quercusbooks.co.uk/titles/james-milner/ask-a-footballer/9781529404937/\" title=\"\">Ask a Footballer</a>.

Milner answers a series of open-ended questions put to him, mostly by fans, and uses the concept to expand on his distinctive career.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/27/liverpool-beating-heart-jordan-henderson-relentless-in-breaking-spurs\">Liverpool\u2019s beating heart Henderson is relentless in breaking Spurs | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His early years were very different to the path followed by pampered young footballers today. He was 16 when he made his Premier League debut for Leeds in 2002 and the character of Milner was sealed in those gritty days. \u201cHundred percent,\u201d he says. \u201cI was playing in the Premier League and still cleaning the under-18s captain\u2019s boots. I was scoring goals in the Premier League but, after the game, I\u2019m picking up the kit, taking the dirty slips to the bus with the kitman. I had to make tea on the bus. After 20 games in the Premier League, with a few goals, the kitman said: \u2018Go on, get on the bus.\u2019 That made me feel so good. But it gave me such hunger and you knew your place.</p> <p>\u201cIt definitely helped me and they\u2019re good values that I wish were still in the game. It would help young players. They\u2019re now looked after amazingly well but there\u2019s more scrutiny on social media. In some ways they probably have it harder than we did as kids.\u201d</p> <p>Milner sounds pragmatic rather than wistful when pointing out that dressing rooms are now much quieter and more sanitised. But his remorseless professionalism has not cost him his wit or honesty. He still speaks in unvarnished detail when, like here, he is relaxed during an hour-long interview and I ask him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/26/var-needs-to-work-faster-and-better-but-is-proving-to-be-a-joy-with-jeopardy\" title=\"\">about VAR</a>: \u201cI\u2019m not a fan at all.\u201d</p> <p>Milner grins when I remind him that, in his book, he says he hates VAR. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s in writing. So we\u2019ll go with that. It might just be the old school part of me but I think there\u2019s still too much debate around VAR. Goal-line technology is incredible. Instant decision. Black and white. But it\u2019s very hard to use VAR when you\u2019ve still got opinions on the decisions and the atmosphere is being ruined. You score, there\u2019s an explosion of noise and then it\u2019s VAR. You wait. Is it a goal?</p> <p>\u201cI had the experience of a penalty the other week [when Milner scored a much-delayed last-minute spot-kick to win the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/liverpool-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">game against Leicester</a>]. That was a new experience as they\u2019re debating if it\u2019s going to be a penalty. I think there\u2019s use for it \u2013 if we can improve it. But football is a game of human error on the field and in officiating as well. They have a very tough job and I\u2019m all for making their lives easier \u2013 but not at the expense of the flow of the game. If the VAR took away controversy I\u2019d back it 100%. But we\u2019re still having discussions about VAR. I don\u2019t think many footballers feel differently.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b8c850a6e5038c253b5f4f78068aa40beb89115a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8c850a6e5038c253b5f4f78068aa40beb89115a/0_280_2064_2806/736.jpg\" alt=\"Milner made his Premier League debut as a teenager with Leeds\" width=\"736\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milner made his Premier League debut as a teenager with Leeds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary M.

Me and Phil Dowd were close to each other, and he pulled my shirt. I look around, and I\u2019m thinking: \u2018Ref!\u2019 But, hang on a moment, it is the ref!

This was just before we went to the ground for the final and we had our usual 15-minute meeting. He just lifted his top and had Cristiano\u2019s boxer shorts on. Everyone started laughing \u2013 as you would before a Champions League final against one of the best players in the world and your manager\u2019s wearing his boxer shorts. He just relaxed everyone. That\u2019s why he\u2019s such a good manager.\u201d</p> <p>Did Klopp say much to Milner before this year\u2019s Champions League final? Milner had started virtually every Champions League game \u2013 but he was on the bench in the final. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything. He only explained his thinking to me after the game. He said he wanted me on the field at the end. If it got nervy he wanted me playing \u2013 especially if it went to extra time or penalties. I was obviously disappointed but you win things as a squad. After a day you think: \u2018What can I do to help us win this trophy?\u2019 Anyway I came on after an hour and we won. When you get over the line it\u2019s amazing and you remember all the games you\u2019ve played \u2013 like beating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/07/liverpool-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">Barcelona 4-0 at Anfield</a>. Winning it was incredible.\u201d</p> <p>The league now matters most to Liverpool, after a 30-year wait, and Milner acknowledges that the yearning of the fans can be intense. \u201cThey started getting quite nervous early in the title race last season. It was the first time I had sensed that atmosphere at Anfield. But nothing really changes in the dressing room. The lads are always calm and confident and hopefully winning the Champions League settles people down. I hope they can just enjoy it. As much as people want the trophy, it\u2019s the journey that you enjoy most.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to win the league. I\u2019ve been fortunate to win it a couple of times [with Manchester City] and last year we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/03/hope-heart-liverpool-premier-league-donald-mcrae-tom-jenkins\" title=\"\">were so close</a>. We were flying. We were winning every week and felt we should be 10 points clear. And you\u2019re still second. Last year, if you\u2019d have said: \u2018You\u2019ll only lose one [league] game all season,\u2019 I\u2019d have snapped your hand off. But it wasn\u2019t good enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4723fc6d75c19cd0ba6c948225e6189aa14bd95a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4723fc6d75c19cd0ba6c948225e6189aa14bd95a/0_0_6570_4380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milner\u2019s Premier League career has also taken in spells at Aston Villa, Newcastle and Manchester City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milner\u2019s Premier League career has also taken in spells at Aston Villa, Newcastle and Manchester City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis season we have a team that can do it. I think there\u2019s a calm around the club, both inside and outside, and people are confident we can get it done. But City are so good they\u2019re capable of winning every game. The gap is not that big so we have to just keep pushing, and not worry too much about the title.\u201d</p> <p>A six-point lead seems a comfortable margin for Liverpool after 10 games, with nine wins and draw, but next weekend they face City. \u201cA couple of bad games can happen,\u201d Milner admits, \u201cand with the amount of games we\u2019re playing there might be a couple of injuries. It could be a couple of poor performances and the lead\u2019s gone. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so special to win the league. It\u2019s so difficult and the best team always wins the league, no matter what. Hopefully winning that first trophy, the European Cup, as a squad will give us the experience to win the league.\u201d</p> <p>Milner played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/20/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against United</a> at Old Trafford \u2013 in the only game that Liverpool have dropped points so far. \u201cThey defended well and we only played our best for the last 15 minutes. It\u2019s never easy after an international break. That\u2019s no excuse but it might explain the lack of rhythm. The fight was there to the end and we got a point. You see that character in the squad time and time again. If someone\u2019s not in the gym you say: \u2018Where were you today?\u2019 That\u2019s the sort of dressing room we have. It\u2019s massive.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The best players might make a mistake once, twice maximum. But they learn from it and never do it again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>High standards also prevail in the Milner household. He nods when I ask if he is still talking to his small children in Spanish. \u201cI\u2019ll repeat things in English after I\u2019ve spoken to them in Spanish. But, yeah, always Spanish first. My daughter understands everything. My son repeats more, and doesn\u2019t understand as much. But a child\u2019s mind is incredible really. They pick up things so fast so it\u2019s the best time to do it. I got the idea because Ga\u00ebl Clichy [his former City teammate] said his daughter spoke three or four different languages. When I started to talk to the kids in Spanish my wife probably thought it would last a couple of weeks. But then again she knows me. Maybe she knew I\u2019d do it all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Milner did not reveal the extent of his Spanish to Lionel Messi after he had fouled him in the first leg at Barcelona last season. Messi reminded Milner of how he nutmegged him while calling him a \u201cburro\u201d \u2013 without realising the Yorkshireman understood it meant donkey in English. \u201cI just smiled and went back to the dressing room. We weren\u2019t in the best position then. But Messi\u2019s incredible. I\u2019m lucky to have played against him and Ronaldo because the numbers they put up every year are ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Milner says that Wilfried Zaha is the player against whom he has had the most difficulty. \u201cI\u2019ve been sent off for tackles on him twice. He\u2019s a talent. Unpredictable. You see how difficult it is to deal with him when you\u2019re watching him. And when you play against Zaha he\u2019s tricky and very tough to face.\u201d</p> <p>Last week Patrice Evra said the same about Milner when naming him as the player against whom he struggled most. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s a compliment,\u201d Milner says. \u201cHe thought I was a nuisance.\u201d</p> <p>Milner had far more critics at the start of his career \u2013 and he could have been ruined by comments attributed to Graeme Souness, his manager at Newcastle, who apparently said you can never win anything with a team of 11 James Milners. \u201cI was 18 so I wanted to show him he was wrong. Since then, he said he was misquoted. That was fuel for me, whether he said it or not. Ironically he was covering the game when we won the Premier League the first time at City. He didn\u2019t have to come over but he did. He was very nice and I have no problems with him. I think he\u2019s a legend.\u201d</p> <p>Milner was tested at City. There were occasions when he would drive home from training in tears because, no matter how well he played, he was left out of the team. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating when you feel like you can\u2019t do any more. But that\u2019s where you need that character and strength to bounce back. I always had good people around me which helped. The biggest thing in football, and life, is that you make mistakes. The best players might make a mistake once, twice maximum. But they learn from it and never do it again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"58078d53db451ba1358d5aea343ad6c94d45d4a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58078d53db451ba1358d5aea343ad6c94d45d4a2/0_0_3189_2421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milner smiles after the win over Tottenham on Sunday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"759\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milner smiles after the win over Tottenham on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Milner has learned from his mistakes and, even after making his 500th Premier League appearance last season, he is hungry for more. At 33 he still tops the fitness tests at Liverpool. \u201cSomeone said to me, a few years back, that I\u2019m going to have to rein it in in training, and look after myself a bit. I didn\u2019t agree. I felt that the more I pushed myself, then the higher level I get in terms of fitness. I still feel very good and no different to what I did six years ago. My contract with Liverpool is up at the end of the season but hopefully we\u2019ll sort something out. I want to keep going as long as possible at the highest level.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, Milner will continue having fun. \u201cI started using a sleeptalking app years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t use it every day but Robbo [Andy Robertson] and I had a laugh. Robbo said: \u2018I also talk in my sleep.\u2019 So we used it and we found it was me who was doing most of the talking \u2013 in Spanish. Robbo was making farm noises.\u201d</p> <p>This perhaps shows who is the most intelligent out of Liverpool\u2019s two jokers? \u201cYou could say that. On the pitch Robbo is unbelievable and off the pitch he is a great character. He also had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/21/andy-robertson-liverpool-real-madrid-interview-champions-league-final\" title=\"\">difficult journey into football</a> but his ability is massive. He\u2019s a big presence within the dressing room, lively, enjoys a joke and never shuts up. It\u2019s important to have those characters in the squad especially when, like us, you\u2019re chasing something special.\u201d</p> <p><em>James Milner\u2019s Ask a Footballer is published by Quercus</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Before we explore the unglamorous roots of this story, James Milner captures the pain and glory of losing and winning a Champions League final and sails through the ebbs and flows of a Premier League career that has lasted 17 years so far. He voices his contempt for VAR and celebrates his insistence on talking in Spanish to his children. Milner also reveals that he and Andy Robertson, his Liverpool teammate, have used a sleep-talking app \u2013 which proves that Milner speaks in Spanish while asleep. These topics are addressed in an entertaining book called Ask a Footballer. The footballer in question is Milner, who has made the sixth-most appearances in Premier League history while subverting his image from being parodied as the most boring man in football to becoming one of the most interesting players in the game. Milner answers a series of open-ended questions put to him, mostly by fans, and uses the concept to expand on his distinctive career. His early years were very different to the path followed by pampered young footballers today. He was 16 when he made his Premier League debut for Leeds in 2002 and the character of Milner was sealed in those gritty days. \u201cHundred percent,\u201d he says. \u201cI was playing in the Premier League and still cleaning the under-18s captain\u2019s boots. I was scoring goals in the Premier League but, after the game, I\u2019m picking up the kit, taking the dirty slips to the bus with the kitman. I had to make tea on the bus. After 20 games in the Premier League, with a few goals, the kitman said: \u2018Go on, get on the bus.\u2019 That made me feel so good. But it gave me such hunger and you knew your place. \u201cIt definitely helped me and they\u2019re good values that I wish were still in the game. It would help young players. They\u2019re now looked after amazingly well but there\u2019s more scrutiny on social media. In some ways they probably have it harder than we did as kids.\u201d Milner sounds pragmatic rather than wistful when pointing out that dressing rooms are now much quieter and more sanitised. But his remorseless professionalism has not cost him his wit or honesty. He still speaks in unvarnished detail when, like here, he is relaxed during an hour-long interview and I ask him about VAR: \u201cI\u2019m not a fan at all.\u201d Milner grins when I remind him that, in his book, he says he hates VAR. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s in writing. So we\u2019ll go with that. It might just be the old school part of me but I think there\u2019s still too much debate around VAR. Goal-line technology is incredible. Instant decision. Black and white. But it\u2019s very hard to use VAR when you\u2019ve still got opinions on the decisions and the atmosphere is being ruined. You score, there\u2019s an explosion of noise and then it\u2019s VAR. You wait. Is it a goal? \u201cI had the experience of a penalty the other week [when Milner scored a much-delayed last-minute spot-kick to win the game against Leicester]. That was a new experience as they\u2019re debating if it\u2019s going to be a penalty. I think there\u2019s use for it \u2013 if we can improve it.

Afterwards you think: \u2018Did that really happen?\u2019\u201d Did Dowd say much to him? \u201cYeah. We were joking about it. Strange. But it happened.\u201d Milner also confirms that J\u00fcrgen Klopp really did wear CR7 boxer shorts when making his final team talk before Liverpool faced Ronaldo and Real Madrid in the 2018 Champions League final. \u201cHe thinks deeply about what he\u2019s going to say before a game \u2013 and the CR7 thing broke the ice. This was just before we went to the ground for the final and we had our usual 15-minute meeting. He just lifted his top and had Cristiano\u2019s boxer shorts on. Everyone started laughing \u2013 as you would before a Champions League final against one of the best players in the world and your manager\u2019s wearing his boxer shorts. He just relaxed everyone. That\u2019s why he\u2019s such a good manager.\u201d Did Klopp say much to Milner before this year\u2019s Champions League final? Milner had started virtually every Champions League game \u2013 but he was on the bench in the final. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything. He only explained his thinking to me after the game. He said he wanted me on the field at the end. If it got nervy he wanted me playing \u2013 especially if it went to extra time or penalties. I was obviously disappointed but you win things as a squad. After a day you think: \u2018What can I do to help us win this trophy?\u2019 Anyway I came on after an hour and we won.

It was the first time I had sensed that atmosphere at Anfield. But nothing really changes in the dressing room. The lads are always calm and confident and hopefully winning the Champions League settles people down. I hope they can just enjoy it. As much as people want the trophy, it\u2019s the journey that you enjoy most. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to win the league. I\u2019ve been fortunate to win it a couple of times [with Manchester City] and last year we were so close. We were flying. We were winning every week and felt we should be 10 points clear. And you\u2019re still second. Last year, if you\u2019d have said: \u2018You\u2019ll only lose one [league] game all season,\u2019 I\u2019d have snapped your hand off. But it wasn\u2019t good enough. \u201cThis season we have a team that can do it. I think there\u2019s a calm around the club, both inside and outside, and people are confident we can get it done. But City are so good they\u2019re capable of winning every game. The gap is not that big so we have to just keep pushing, and not worry too much about the title.\u201d A six-point lead seems a comfortable margin for Liverpool after 10 games, with nine wins and draw, but next weekend they face City. \u201cA couple of bad games can happen,\u201d Milner admits, \u201cand with the amount of games we\u2019re playing there might be a couple of injuries.

There were occasions when he would drive home from training in tears because, no matter how well he played, he was left out of the team. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating when you feel like you can\u2019t do any more. But that\u2019s where you need that character and strength to bounce back. I always had good people around me which helped. The biggest thing in football, and life, is that you make mistakes. The best players might make a mistake once, twice maximum. But they learn from it and never do it again.\u201d Milner has learned from his mistakes and, even after making his 500th Premier League appearance last season, he is hungry for more. At 33 he still tops the fitness tests at Liverpool. \u201cSomeone said to me, a few years back, that I\u2019m going to have to rein it in in training, and look after myself a bit. I didn\u2019t agree. I felt that the more I pushed myself, then the higher level I get in terms of fitness. I still feel very good and no different to what I did six years ago. My contract with Liverpool is up at the end of the season but hopefully we\u2019ll sort something out. I want to keep going as long as possible at the highest level.\u201d In the meantime, Milner will continue having fun. \u201cI started using a sleeptalking app years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t use it every day but Robbo [Andy Robertson] and I had a laugh. Robbo said: \u2018I also talk in my sleep.\u2019 So we used it and we found it was me who was doing most of the talking \u2013 in Spanish. Robbo was making farm noises.\u201d This perhaps shows who is the most intelligent out of Liverpool\u2019s two jokers? \u201cYou could say that. On the pitch Robbo is unbelievable and off the pitch he is a great character. He also had a difficult journey into football but his ability is massive. He\u2019s a big presence within the dressing room, lively, enjoys a joke and never shuts up. It\u2019s important to have those characters in the squad especially when, like us, you\u2019re chasing something special.\u201d James Milner\u2019s Ask a Footballer is published by Quercus",

      "bodyText": "An 84-year-old man who once stood as a far-right candidate in local elections has been arrested on suspicion of carrying out a shooting and arson attack that injured two people outside a mosque in south-west France. Two men aged 74 and 78 are in a serious but stable condition in hospital after the incident in Bayonne on Monday afternoon. Police said a man tried to set fire to the door of the mosque and that when he was interrupted, he opened fire. The man then set fire to a car before fleeing, police said. The suspect was arrested close to his home in the Landes, 10 miles away. The two injured men are believed to have been worshippers at the mosque.

      "bodyText": "The decision by the billionaire Barclay brothers to put the Daily and Sunday Telegraph up for sale could herald the breakup of a vast but faltering business empire that ranges from luxury hotels to budget retail. Bidders are already circling the newspaper group after the identical twin brothers, who were 85 on Sunday, launched a sale process expected to recoup less than a third of the \u00a3665m they paid for it in 2004. Potential buyers include the publisher of the Daily Mail, foreign media groups and even the world\u2019s richest man \u2013 Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos. The sale also comes in the context of a wider review of the Barclays\u2019 business interests, which include the loss-making online retailer Shop Direct and the Ritz hotel in London. Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay boast a combined wealth of \u00a38bn, putting them 17th on the Sunday Times Rich List, but the financial performance of their sprawling network of businesses has proven patchy of late. The largest companies in their investment portfolio \u2013 Telegraph Media Group; the Spectator magazine; delivery firm Yodel; Shop Direct; the Ritz and the Beaumont hotel \u2013 are managed by Sir David\u2019s son Aidan and reported combined losses of \u00a3290m on revenues of \u00a32.8bn, in the latest year for which financial records are available. As losses have mounted, the brothers were reported this month to have put the Ritz up for sale at \u00a3800m, more than 10 times the \u00a375m they paid for it in 1995. Telegraph Media Group is expected to have a price tag of about \u00a3200m, according to media industry sources. That would be less than a third of the \u00a3665m they paid in 2004, although that purchase included the Spectator, which is not part of the current sale process. One reason for any fall in the value of the Telegraph group is whether it is still perceived as a \u201ctrophy\u201d asset worth more than the sum of its parts, given a decline of profits and sales in recent years. \u201cIt may have been a trophy asset when the Barclays bought it but you would struggle to say that now,\u201d said one City source. Potential suitors include DMGT, owner of the Mail titles, Mail Online and Metro, which is understood to have previously expressed an interest, although it would likely face regulatory scrutiny. Sources also pointed to Belgian group Mediahuis, which earlier this year paid \u20ac145.6m (\u00a3125.2m) to buy Independent News &amp; Media, publisher of the Irish Independent and Sunday Independent. INM is chaired by Murdoch MacLennan, a former chief executive of Telegraph Media Group who is rumoured to have encouraged a bid for his former employer. Interest is also expected from publishing investment vehicle National World, run by David Montgomery, the former chief executive of the publisher of the Mirror titles. Montgomery advised venture capital firm 3i in a bid to buy the Telegraph in 2004, in a bidding war that ultimately saw the Barclays triumph.

But both are at least profitable, which is more than can be said for some of the larger cornerstones of the Barclay edifice. Their biggest business by revenue is online retailer Shop Direct, which includes Very and the bones of Littlewoods, the department store chain for which they shelled out \u00a3750m in 2002 but which no longer has a bricks and mortar presence. Liverpool-based Shop Direct racked up revenues of just under \u00a32bn last year, an increase of nearly 2% on the previous year. But accounts released last week showed that it slumped \u00a3185.5m into the red, a loss seven times greater than that reported last year, due to \u00a3310m in exceptional costs.

The company said it had been forced to set aside cash to cover \u201ccustomer redress payments for historical shopping insurance sales\u201d and was looking at funding alternatives to cope with the liability. The poor performance for 2018 came a year after the Barclays lost a \u00a31.25bn lawsuit against HM Revenues &amp; Customs, after the supreme court ruled that Littlewoods had not overpaid its taxes. Parcels and courier business Yodel, built on the foundations of Shop Direct\u2019s delivery network, has fared no better than Shop Direct of late. It suffered a pre-tax loss of \u00a3116.4m last year on revenues of \u00a3481.5m, as customers deserted a business that struggled to shake off a reputation as one of the UK\u2019s most complained-about companies.

They don\u2019t want their work to be undervalued. It affects everything about their lives, it\u2019s not just about finances which are important \u2026 it is also about self-respect and about progression as well as pay.\u201d</p> <p>Gracie said that women such as Ahmed were willing to risk damage to their career in order to see \u201cequality honoured\u201d after being unsatisfied with the BBC\u2019s internal pay review processes: \u201cHer case is emblematic and extremely important to all the other women still fighting.\u201d</p> <p>Equal pay is different to the broader issue of the gender pay gap. Cases brought under equal pay legislation are based on specific claims that an individual was paid less than a colleague for doing the same, or equivalent, work.</p> <p>Gracie also highlighted wider concerns about BBC executives being unwilling to accept they have made mistakes, citing the recent row over the handling of a complaint against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/30/bbc-racism-row-naga-munchetty-complaint-was-also-about-dan-walker\">Naga Munchetty regarding comments about Donald Trump</a>: \u201cThis is not the kind of thing that management likes to see.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is facing at least a dozen legal cases from female members of staff who believe they were illegally paid less than their male counterparts, as a high-profile employment tribunal hearing gets underway involving the presenter Samira Ahmed. Ahmed is claiming she was underpaid by hundreds of thousands of pounds since taking over as host of the BBC\u2019s Newswatch programme in 2012. On Monday she arrived at the central London employment tribunal accompanied by dozens of well-wishers, including BBC Breakfast show host Naga Munchetty and the poet Lemn Sissay, who cheered as Ahmed entered the building. Carrie Gracie, the BBC\u2019s former China editor who resigned last year over equal pay, told reporters at the tribunal hearing that Ahmed is only the first of many cases in the pipeline: \u201cWomen want equality, they want their work respected. They don\u2019t want their work to be undervalued. It affects everything about their lives, it\u2019s not just about finances which are important \u2026 it is also about self-respect and about progression as well as pay.\u201d Gracie said that women such as Ahmed were willing to risk damage to their career in order to see \u201cequality honoured\u201d after being unsatisfied with the BBC\u2019s internal pay review processes: \u201cHer case is emblematic and extremely important to all the other women still fighting.\u201d Equal pay is different to the broader issue of the gender pay gap. Cases brought under equal pay legislation are based on specific claims that an individual was paid less than a colleague for doing the same, or equivalent, work. Gracie also highlighted wider concerns about BBC executives being unwilling to accept they have made mistakes, citing the recent row over the handling of a complaint against Naga Munchetty regarding comments about Donald Trump: \u201cThis is not the kind of thing that management likes to see. None of these people are going to be the favourites of their management while doing this.\u201d The BBC has already accepted that Ahmed was underpaid by between 50% and 33% compared to male colleagues for her work on programmes for Radio 4 and Radio 3, pledging to make up the difference. However, they are resisting Ahmed\u2019s claim that she was unfairly paid for her work presenting Newswatch , for which she received \u00a3440 an episode. She claims this is unfair because at the same time Jeremy Vine was paid \u00a33,000 for presenting each episode of Points of View, a programme of similar length also featuring viewer feedback on BBC programmes. Calculations suggest the total claim for five years of systematic underpayment could be as much as half a million pounds. Ahmed\u2019s tribunal hearing was closed to the public and reporters on Monday. Witnesses will only start giving evidence on Wednesday in hearings that could be potentially embarrassing for the broadcaster and lay bare some of its pay discussions. Before entering the hearing Ahmed, who is fighting the case with the support of the National Union of Journalists, issued a statement insisting she continued to believe in the BBC\u2019s mission. \u201cI have a sense of pride working for a public service broadcaster which seeks to represent the diversity of Britain and its licence-fee payers. On the back of my BBC ID card are written the BBC values, which include \u2018we respect each other and celebrate our diversity\u2019 and \u2018we take pride in delivering quality and value for money\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.\u201d A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cPoints of View is an entertainment programme with a long history and is a household name with the public.

The only difference is that this cache is not full of cat memes but rather decades of research delving into the hierarchies of labour, the formation of memories and the development of social history.

A quick trip into settings and the browser forgets all your logins, your recently viewed websites and Google searches for things like \u201cDonald Trump impeachment odds\u201d, \u201cbest sustainable swimsuits\u201d and \u201chow do I clear the cache?\u201d But what if we didn\u2019t clear the cache? What if \u2013 instead \u2013 we kept returning to the webpages we viewed for one minute, mining them for information and viewing them as avenues of exploration? That is what Elizabeth Price does in A Long Memory at the Whitworth, the Turner prize winner\u2019s most extensive exhibition to date. The only difference is that this cache is not full of cat memes but rather decades of research delving into the hierarchies of labour, the formation of memories and the development of social history. It is long in both its observation of time (looking to the future while reflecting on events in the 1970s) and in the depth of its investigation. Yet for something so multi-layered, A Long Memory is surprisingly succinct. Price is known for her rollicking multi-screen video projections that blend thumping bass with robotic narrators, bold text and a cascade of images. But this show opens quietly with a new series of photographs, sculptural prints and the archive of coal mine photographer Albert Walker, who informed Price\u2019s video work KOHL. GETT REDY is a collection of black and white photographs shot using a pinhole camera and various stencils. Greeted by a series of human tongues on the left and an assortment of glassware on the right, we consider how we form and hold memories. A glass is raised high to mark marriages, graduations, birthdays and any sort of momentous occasion. When we lift that glass to our mouths, thousands of taste buds savour and memorise our favourite flavours. Price\u2019s reintroduction of a more hands-on type of creating is her own refusal to lose knowledge after 15 years tapping away at a computer.

      "bodyText": "Millions of people around the world are hitting the streets this year in support of students who are demanding an end to fossil fuels. But we can also strike with our forks: global food production contributes around a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. Australia was recently flagged as one of the countries with the greatest potential to reduce diet-related greenhouse gas emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) declared that it is crucial for all sectors to rally against global heating, and targets to slow it down simply can\u2019t be achieved without addressing food production and land management. Environmental degradation also goes hand-in-hand with the global pandemic of chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes, cancer and heart disease. This double whammy includes other factors associated with industrial monocrops, such as pesticides and fertiliser. So tweaking dietary habits is a win-win for people and the planet. But just what would a climate-friendly diet look like? Meat would feature less Meat and dairy are two primary contenders, according to the IPCC \u2013 cattle production is a major source of methane emissions and deforestation. This is particularly relevant for Australians who relish their steaks and sausages \u2013 they are the world\u2019s second biggest meat eaters. Given that more than one in 10 people \u2013 and rising \u2013 is vegetarian some of us are eating an awful lot of animal flesh. In fact, Australian meat consumption has grown from 93kg to nearly 95kg per person each year \u2013 that\u2019s equivalent to everyone eating a very large steak every day. \u201cThe mass production of meat is the single biggest cause of land clearing around the world, if not directly for the animals themselves then indirectly for the monocultures such as corn or soy that feed them,\u201d says economist Dr Gillian Hewitson from the University of Sydney. Sustainability expert Dr Michalis Hadjikakou, from Deakin University, Melbourne, agrees that reducing meat is a good start, but acknowledges radical shifts to vegan or vegetarian diets are difficult for many. For those who struggle, he suggests cutting back on beef and lamb, meats with the biggest environmental footprint. Other more sustainable options include kangaroo meat \u2013 which is harvested wild under strict quotas and is becoming increasingly popular. Wild rabbit is another eco-friendly option that is making its way back onto Australian menus. Insects such as mealworms and crickets are also climate-friendly alternatives, for those who can stomach them. If not, other viable non-meat protein sources abound, including legumes, nuts, seeds (think quinoa, chia), wholegrains, eggs \u2013 and even nutty-flavoured hemp. Vegetarians might need to rethink too New research is making it harder to gloss over dairy\u2019s impact, suggesting that swapping out bacon for haloumi is not much gentler on the planet. The study models country-specific dietary changes that could alleviate our climate, water and health crises. Overall, it confirms that bovine, sheep and goat meats have by far the highest environmental impact. But eating certain animal products once a day has a smaller footprint than lacto-ovo vegetarian diets that exclude meats but include dairy foods. The small footprint of this \u201clow-food-chain\u201d diet, in which insects, forage fish and mollusks replaced a large chunk of terrestrial and aquatic animals, was second only to vegan diets. Plants would feature more In any event, switching to more plant foods is considered paramount for planetary and human health \u2013 especially as most Australians don\u2019t eat enough of them. Plant foods are staples of traditional diets, and the much-researched Mediterranean diet \u2013 rich in vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, seeds, wholegrains and extra virgin olive oil \u2013 delivers multiple health benefits with its kaleidoscope of nutrients and fibre. As a bonus, Australians can grow pretty much anything that thrives in Mediterranean regions \u2013 even in our own backyards \u2013 and research has shown this diet is both viable and easy for Australians to adopt. A wider variety of plants would be eaten Possibly some of the most sustainable \u2013 and nutritious \u2013 foods could be growing wild in our backyards or footpaths: edible weeds. Most cities even have guided foraging tours to help residents find them. Gardening expert Kate Wall, for instance, runs regular weed workshops in Brisbane that explore which weeds are edible and what can be done with them. \u201cWe have a forage and together we create a three-course meal with drinks, all based on weeds,\u201d she says. Over tens of thousands of years, the keen eyes of Indigenous Australians have unearthed this large island\u2019s abundance of nutritious, edible native plants that are adapted to our parched climate. From bush tomatoes and desert limes to Kakadu plums, quandong and riberries, there are potentially thousands of species to be widely adopted. Eating seasonal foods grown locally and avoiding imported foods can be another way to support the environment. There are, however, some contingencies depending on how it\u2019s grown \u2013 for instance, indoor farms that rely on artificial sunlight may be hyper-local, but they\u2019re not very energy efficient.

According to standard economic theory the lowest it can go is 0%, but negative interest rates just ignore that and set a rate where the RBA is effectively paying banks to borrow money.</p> <p>Imagine taking out a mortgage and getting interest payments rather than having to pay them!</p> <p>First off, I should let you know that it not likely to ever happen.</p> <p>A number of countries currently have negative interest rates \u2013 most notably Japan, which has had negative interest rate for nearly four years now \u2013 but even in those countries the mortgage rate <a href=\"https://www.ceicdata.com/en/japan/mortgage-rate\">is still above zero</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Official interest rates\">  <iframe title=\"Official interest rates\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fJCZy/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Negative interest rates are generally unadvisable, however, because it makes for a pretty dire situation for both savers and the banks themselves, whose margins get squeezed.</p> <p>They also have the effect of signalling to everyone that the economy is tanking, which can have a negative effect as people stop spending out of fear that bad times are ahead.</p> <p>Negative interest rates are not the only unconventional monetary policy that central banks can pursue. The other most-used measure is \u201cquantitative easing\u201d (QE), which is a term so mangled in jargon that it appears mostly used to ensure no one really knows what it means.</p> <p>Basically it is the central bank increasing the amount of money in the system. It doesn\u2019t do this by printing more money, but by buying a set amount of government bonds or bank-owned mortgage backed securities.</p> <p>QE has the impact of lowering the yields for these bonds and thus reducing the borrowing costs for companies and households.</p> <p>The other unconventional option is for the RBA to give forward guidance \u2013 such as saying it would not raise interest rates until certain conditions have occurred \u2013 such as an unemployment rate below 5% and inflation growth above 2.5%.</p> <p>Now, as noted you are not likely to be getting a negative mortgage rate, and even a cash rate below zero looks unlikely in the near future.</p> <p>There has been some movement on the futures market as investors and speculators try to read the RBA tea leaves, but for now the market anticipates another cut in the cash rate to 0.5%, but no real likelihood of a cut further than that.</p> <p>These things can change fast, however.</p> <p>At the start of this year the market was expecting the cash rate at this point would still be 1.5%, and even in June the anticipation was that the cash rate would now be 1.0%, as opposed to the actual rate of 0.75%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Market expectations of the RBA cash rate\">  <iframe title=\"Market expectations of the RBA cash rate\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7bo2n/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Things could be very different to what is anticipated currently \u2013 although over the past decade the market has generally been too optimistic about when interest rates will start to rise.</p> <p>And so even while it may not seem likely, the possibility of the cash rate going below zero is very much in the front of both the RBA\u2019s and the government\u2019s minds.</p> <p>The governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, recently <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs63.pdf\">co-authored a paper</a> by the Bank of International Settlements (often called the central banks\u2019 central bank) which discussed the efficacy of unconventional monetary policy.</p> <p>And over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/cabinet-considers-qe-amid-rate-warnings/news-story/55b1e8e9f487d540065a916e8c843e27\">the Australian\u2019s Michael Roddan</a> revealed an FOI-obtained Treasury department briefing on \u201cunconventional monetary policy\u201d provided to the cabinet.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-10/foi_2554.pdf\">documents</a> are themselves not all that shocking; they are the standard briefing note that the public service produces on all manner of issues every day. The shocking aspect is that the treasurer\u2019s office was actually asking for such a brief.</p> <p>There really are only two reasons why the Reserve Bank would adopt either negative interest rates or one of the other big \u201cunconventional\u201d policies: that the economy had deteriorated to such a state that the cash rate needed to be cut another three times to 0%, and that the government at the same time had refused to use any fiscal stimulus measures.</p> <p>The BIS paper on unconventional monetary policy makes this quite clear, noting that one of the problems of such measures is that \u201cit might induce a bias toward inaction among other policy authorities, such as regulatory, prudential and fiscal policymakers, if they believe the burden of policy interventions can be left to the central bank\u201d.</p> <p>The Treasury\u2019s own briefing supports this, noting that one of the problems of negative interest rates and QE is that they can cause a big increase in asset prices such as housing, while not improving the broader economy. It also noted that they can be difficult to unwind, and \u201cas such, fiscal policy can play a greater role when monetary policy is constrained\u201d.</p> <p>But there remains no sense of the government wanting to pursue any sort of fiscal stimulus, other than the tax cuts it has already legislated and which are taking some time to flow through into any meaningful pickup in demand.</p> <p>Certainly the forward-looking measures of inflation expectations show no sign of increased demand, despite the current record low interest rates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Inflation and inflation expectations\">  <iframe title=\"Inflation and inflation expectations\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8lQNN/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Essentially the government is hoping that while record low interest rates have not yet spurred an increase in demand, even lower record rates will do so.</p> <p>No one suggests we are at a point where we should be pursuing extreme fiscal stimulus as occurred during the GFC, and yet there appears to be willingness within the government for extreme monetary policy to be pursued.</p> <p>And extreme measures are only ever a sign that things have not gone to plan. Negative interest rates and quantitative easing are \u201cbreak glass in case of emergency\u201d measures; a prudent government might instead consider what it can do to ensure that emergency does not occur<a href=\"xhttp://www.theguardian.com\">.</a></p> <p>\u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boring old monetary policy is currently being given a jolt, as the government and Reserve Bank consider \u201cunconventional\u201d policy measures such as negative interest rates. And while they are extreme responses to a stagnant economy, they are also signs of how unwilling the government is to let go of its budget surplus, even while the economy cries out for stimulus. Negative interest rates sound like some mad economic science that turns everything we are used to on its head, because they mean the lender pays the interest rather than the borrower. Essentially, however, it is just an extension of standard monetary policy, where the RBA lowers the cash rate in order to reduce the costs for banks, which then lower their rates and encourage more people and businesses to borrow. Right now the cash rate is 0.75%. According to standard economic theory the lowest it can go is 0%, but negative interest rates just ignore that and set a rate where the RBA is effectively paying banks to borrow money. Imagine taking out a mortgage and getting interest payments rather than having to pay them! First off, I should let you know that it not likely to ever happen. A number of countries currently have negative interest rates \u2013 most notably Japan, which has had negative interest rate for nearly four years now \u2013 but even in those countries the mortgage rate is still above zero. Negative interest rates are generally unadvisable, however, because it makes for a pretty dire situation for both savers and the banks themselves, whose margins get squeezed. They also have the effect of signalling to everyone that the economy is tanking, which can have a negative effect as people stop spending out of fear that bad times are ahead. Negative interest rates are not the only unconventional monetary policy that central banks can pursue. The other most-used measure is \u201cquantitative easing\u201d (QE), which is a term so mangled in jargon that it appears mostly used to ensure no one really knows what it means. Basically it is the central bank increasing the amount of money in the system. It doesn\u2019t do this by printing more money, but by buying a set amount of government bonds or bank-owned mortgage backed securities. QE has the impact of lowering the yields for these bonds and thus reducing the borrowing costs for companies and households. The other unconventional option is for the RBA to give forward guidance \u2013 such as saying it would not raise interest rates until certain conditions have occurred \u2013 such as an unemployment rate below 5% and inflation growth above 2.5%. Now, as noted you are not likely to be getting a negative mortgage rate, and even a cash rate below zero looks unlikely in the near future. There has been some movement on the futures market as investors and speculators try to read the RBA tea leaves, but for now the market anticipates another cut in the cash rate to 0.5%, but no real likelihood of a cut further than that. These things can change fast, however. At the start of this year the market was expecting the cash rate at this point would still be 1.5%, and even in June the anticipation was that the cash rate would now be 1.0%, as opposed to the actual rate of 0.75%. Things could be very different to what is anticipated currently \u2013 although over the past decade the market has generally been too optimistic about when interest rates will start to rise. And so even while it may not seem likely, the possibility of the cash rate going below zero is very much in the front of both the RBA\u2019s and the government\u2019s minds. The governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, recently co-authored a paper by the Bank of International Settlements (often called the central banks\u2019 central bank) which discussed the efficacy of unconventional monetary policy. And over the weekend, the Australian\u2019s Michael Roddan revealed an FOI-obtained Treasury department briefing on \u201cunconventional monetary policy\u201d provided to the cabinet. The documents are themselves not all that shocking; they are the standard briefing note that the public service produces on all manner of issues every day. The shocking aspect is that the treasurer\u2019s office was actually asking for such a brief. There really are only two reasons why the Reserve Bank would adopt either negative interest rates or one of the other big \u201cunconventional\u201d policies: that the economy had deteriorated to such a state that the cash rate needed to be cut another three times to 0%, and that the government at the same time had refused to use any fiscal stimulus measures. The BIS paper on unconventional monetary policy makes this quite clear, noting that one of the problems of such measures is that \u201cit might induce a bias toward inaction among other policy authorities, such as regulatory, prudential and fiscal policymakers, if they believe the burden of policy interventions can be left to the central bank\u201d. The Treasury\u2019s own briefing supports this, noting that one of the problems of negative interest rates and QE is that they can cause a big increase in asset prices such as housing, while not improving the broader economy. It also noted that they can be difficult to unwind, and \u201cas such, fiscal policy can play a greater role when monetary policy is constrained\u201d. But there remains no sense of the government wanting to pursue any sort of fiscal stimulus, other than the tax cuts it has already legislated and which are taking some time to flow through into any meaningful pickup in demand. Certainly the forward-looking measures of inflation expectations show no sign of increased demand, despite the current record low interest rates. Essentially the government is hoping that while record low interest rates have not yet spurred an increase in demand, even lower record rates will do so. No one suggests we are at a point where we should be pursuing extreme fiscal stimulus as occurred during the GFC, and yet there appears to be willingness within the government for extreme monetary policy to be pursued. And extreme measures are only ever a sign that things have not gone to plan. Negative interest rates and quantitative easing are \u201cbreak glass in case of emergency\u201d measures; a prudent government might instead consider what it can do to ensure that emergency does not occur. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

In a paper by senior economist Alison Pennington, the Australia Institute\u2019s workplace thinktank has warned collective bargaining is on life support in the private sector, with coverage down to 11% and only 46 new collective pay deals negotiated in 2018. The paper released on Tuesday models the effect of key employer demands such as abolishing the better off overall test, removing checks that ensure workers genuinely agree to workplace pay deals, expanding the range of material banned from deals and introducing whole-of-life project agreements. The latter proposal \u2013 to abolish the four-year cap on wage deals for new work sites \u2013 is the subject of one of the first two consultation papers commissioned by the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter. Labor said it was open to the reform before the 2019 election. Pennington noted the government has indicated it will push ahead with the change \u201ccasting doubt on the extent to which the current \u2018review\u2019 constitutes a genuine inquiry, rather than an exercise to prepare the ground for changes it has already decided on\u201d. The paper models the full suite of employer demands by assuming they will increase the proportion of non-union workplace pay deals to 60% \u2013 as occurred in the WorkChoices era \u2013 and calculates lost wages by reference to the fact union agreements increase wages by 1% more per year than non-union deals.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The paper argues the decline in collective bargaining in the private sector is a \u201csignificant factor in the unprecedented deceleration of wages in Australia\u201d. It cites the fact that since 2013 private sector enterprise agreement coverage has halved to 11%, triggering a \u201cdramatic and lasting deceleration in wages\u201d, down to less than 2% in 2016 and 2017. In September, Porter told the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia the Morrison government is searching for industrial relations reforms that are \u201cactually possible\u201d and can achieve consensus in parliament. He said that reforms needed to \u201ccreate jobs and put upward pressure on wages to benefit workers, help business by boosting productivity\u201d and help the economy grow overall. But the Centre for Future Work director, Jim Stanford, told Guardian Australia that project-life agreements are \u201ca step towards limiting collective negotiation\u201d which would \u201cclearly suppress wages\u201d by preventing renegotiation mid-project. He said the reform could have \u201cunexpected\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d consequences if pay deals cover not just the construction phase but operation of the projects. When combined with the ability to strike deals at new sites without unions, the reform could result in \u201ca situation where employers can unilaterally set and lock wages and conditions for a long period of time \u2013 collective bargaining without the bargaining\u201d. The Coalition is also considering harsher penalties for wage theft. In its submission, released on Monday, the Australian Industry Group strongly opposes the introduction of criminal penalties, warning they would discourage employers from self-disclosing underpayments. Ai Group said wage theft was an \u201cinappropriate, misleading and overly emotive term which is leading to some employers being branded as thieves as a result of underpayments which were the result of genuine payroll errors\u201d. On Friday the Senate employment legislation committee delivered a report recommending the passage of the Coalition\u2019s bill to increase court powers to deregister unions or disqualify their officials. But Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick called for a range of changes, including removing the public interest test for union mergers and lifting the threshold so that trivial or technical breaches of the law will not trigger deregistration or disqualification. Porter described the proposed changes as \u201clargely workable\u201d, adding that \u201ca resolution is now much closer\u201d. Porter can now guarantee passage of the bill by making amendments to accommodate Centre Alliance while counting on the vote of Jacqui Lambie, who will vote for it because controversial unionist John Setka has refused to resign, or seek to push it through with Lambie and One Nation\u2019s support.",

But the government is understood to have ruled out a NFF request for a fresh round of exit payments for those wanting to leave the land after the idea was shot down in a meeting of the Coalition\u2019s backbench agriculture committee last week. The government is also facing a push from the Nationals for a $1.3bn expansion of the $130m drought communities program that gives funding directly to affected local councils. But some MPs are understood to have raised concerns internally about how the program has operated, with small councils with as few as 271 people receiving the same amount of taxpayer support through the program as councils with larger populations of up to 160,000. A dozen councils with about 1,000 residents or fewer have received at least $1m under the most recent grants round, with several receiving $2.5m since the program was established.

      "bodyText": "Voters are more inclined to argue the Morrison government should stimulate the economy to avoid a downturn than preserve the long-promised budget surplus at all costs, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The latest survey of 1,033 respondents suggests more than half the sample, 56%, would prioritise stimulating the Australian economy and delaying the surplus to help prevent a downturn over pushing the budget back into black at all costs (33%), with 12% unsure. Voters were asked questions about the economy and budgetary management this fortnight, prompted by the International Monetary Fund downgrading Australia\u2019s economic growth forecasts by 0.4% to 1.7% in 2019 amid rising geopolitical turmoil, and a rolling debate about whether there should be more pump priming of the economy. Asked to identify the main reason why the IMF had revised down Australia\u2019s economic growth forecast, 10% of the sample nominated local factors outside the federal government\u2019s control, 42% nominated global factors outside the federal government\u2019s control, and 29% cited the Morrison government\u2019s economic management, while 19% were unsure. While a chunk of respondents flagged concern about the government\u2019s current stewardship of the economy, with faltering economic growth and interest rates now set to emergency levels, speaking more generally, voters ranked the Coalition ahead of Labor on economic management. Asked which party they trusted more to handle economic management, 49% of the sample said the Coalition and 34% said Labor, with 17% unsure \u2013 the same result as in March, when the question was last asked. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Voters were asked this week to describe their own personal financial situation, which would impact their perceptions of the economy, and 38% characterised themselves as financially comfortable, 39% said they could manage household bills but would struggle to afford anything extra, and 22% reported feeling under financial pressure. The Morrison government has signalled repeatedly it can keep Australia out of a downturn and also guard the budget surplus forecast for next year. Despite the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, calling for further fiscal stimulus, the Coalition is persisting with a plan of relying on income tax cuts legislated in July and leaning on the states to accelerate small-scale infrastructure to stimulate growth \u2013 but the government has not ruled out taking future action if the economy deteriorates. Voters were also asked questions this week about Extinction Rebellion, a global protest movement calling for aggressive action on the climate crisis. The group is spearheading protests in major cities around the world, and its tactics are polarising. Sentiment in the survey is also polarised. For voters in the sample who are aware of Extinction Rebellion and its motives, 52% support the campaign either strongly or somewhat, and 44% oppose the protest activity either strongly or somewhat. The action has some support among Coalition voters, with 21% of people identifying themselves as Coalition voters who are aware of Extinction Rebellion and its objectives supporting the campaign either strongly or somewhat. 70% are opposed either strongly or somewhat. Unsurprisingly, Greens voters are the most supportive group in the sample, while Labor voters are split, but more favour the protest action than oppose it. There has been controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling, as none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition victory on 18 May. The polls instead projected Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis. Guardian Australia is not now publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party-preferred calculation, but is continuing to publish survey results of responses to questions about the leaders and a range of policy issues. The poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus 3%.",

      "bodyText": "A key company in the business empire of Australia\u2019s richest man, Anthony Pratt, has paid very little tax since 2013 despite reaping profits totalling more than $340m over the same period, corporate and tax records show. Pratt, who is ranked No 1 on rich lists maintained by the Australian Financial Review and The Australian, runs a globe-spanning packaging business and has raised money for both sides of politics. At the opening of a Pratt-owned factory in the US last month with Donald Trump, Scott Morrison described Pratt as the \u201cDon Bradman of job creation\u201d. Earlier this year, beforethe federal election, Pratt hosted a $5,000-a-head fundraiser for then opposition leader Bill Shorten at his family\u2019s historic Melbourne mansion, Raheen. Pratt Consolidated Holdings, which is ultimately owned by a Pratt family trust, collects dividends from other companies in the group and passes them on to the trust. Pratt Consolidated Holdings\u2019 most recent annual report, from 2018, does not disclose which companies it owns in Pratt\u2019s global empire, which includes the Visy packaging company in Australia, a similar business called Pratt Industries in the US and a recycling business in Europe. Its accounts, filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, show that between 2013 and 2018 it paid more than $295m to the family trust, and accumulated a net tax benefit of about $2,300. Data provided by the federal government under tax transparency laws shows that between 2014 and 2017 the company accumulated a taxable income of $327m but paid tax in only one of the years in question, 2017, when it paid $18.85m to the ATO. This equates to an effective tax rate of 5.8%, or less than a fifth of the headline corporate tax rate of 30%. Accounting figures and tax data frequently do not match because they are calculated differently. Visy and Pratt\u2019s US chief executive, Brian McPheely, did not respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s inquiries about the tax paid by Pratt Consolidated Holdings, the difference between the figures in company accounts and government data and the structure of the group. However, the company appears to be drawing on tax losses run up from unprofitable activities in the past \u2013 something it would be completely within its legal rights to do. Jason Ward, the principal analyst at the trade union-backed Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research, said it was \u201cdisturbing that one of the largest companies in Australia \u2013 with global operations and owned by Australia\u2019s richest man \u2013 appears to pay virtually no tax\u201d.

Guardian Australia\u2019s questions about the role of Pratt Holdings (Bermuda) Ltd, which Bermudian records show is run by directors including Pratt and his partner, Claudine Revere, were also not answered. However, corporate records in the UK show a Hong Kong company called Allpak Trading owns the European recycling business, Visy Recycling Europe. Allpak is in turn owned by one of the Australian companies in the Visy group, Hong Kong company records show. Visy also has a trading arm in another tax haven, Singapore, that \u201cis innovating supply chains by sourcing new cutting edge products saving our customers time, money and working capital\u201d, according to the company\u2019s website. Neither major political party would comment on Pratt\u2019s tax arrangements, despite a campaign from both to tackle tax avoidance. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t speculate on the detailed tax affairs of any particular taxpayer,\u201d a spokeswoman for the prime minister said. \u201cThere are a number of legitimate reasons why, in any given year, a company may pay tax at a rate below the headline corporate tax rate. \u201cThe government has however taken significant action to ensure that where companies should be paying tax, that they do pay that tax.

Whereas Eddie Jones is able to use Saracens as his foundation, Joe Schmidt had Leinster and Steve Hansen has the Crusaders, Hurricanes and the Chiefs, Gatland has been so feebly served by the regional system in Wales that he has developed many of his own players in training.

He was appointed after guiding the Scarlets to league success and a European Champions Cup semi-final, but he will face a rebuilding programme for the 2023 World Cup. He has a two-year break clause in his contract, along with his coaching team, which includes Stephen Jones, who took over as attack specialist from Robert Howley here, and while his style is different to Gatland\u2019s, laced with more adventure and risk-taking, he will need the ability of his predecessor to squeeze every last drop out of his players, finalise selection and detect potential.</p> <p>Wales\u2019s injuries here meant that their replacements against South Africa barely had more caps between them than Alun Wyn Jones, whose body will surely not last another four years, while Jonathan Davies, Liam Williams, George North, Dan Biggar, Leigh Halfpenny, Ken Owens and Justin Tipuric, Lions all, will probably need replacing by 2023.</p> <p>Pivac has a crop of young players who have gained experience in the past two years, including the flanker Ellis Jenkins, who missed this tournament through injury, but he will have to develop depth and be given time in a country not renowned for its patience: Gatland faced calls to be sacked two years after arriving.</p> <p>Wales, like Ireland, face transition under a new head coach at a time when England have reached the World Cup final while still on the up, unlike 2003 when they had peaked. England have the potential to dominate the Six Nations in the next four-year cycle, unless Fabien Galthi\u00e9 unites France\u2019s warring factions, with Eddie Jones having rebuilt his side over the last year. Gatland succeeded despite the system in Wales and Pivac, who has been here as an observer, will need to repeat the trick \u2013 or the heartache will come sooner.</p>",

Whereas Eddie Jones is able to use Saracens as his foundation, Joe Schmidt had Leinster and Steve Hansen has the Crusaders, Hurricanes and the Chiefs, Gatland has been so feebly served by the regional system in Wales that he has developed many of his own players in training. The latest of them, the prop Rhys Carr\u00e9, arrived here with one cap, against Ireland at the end of August, and not many more league starts for the now Saracens new boy\u2019s former region, Cardiff Blues. Another New Zealander, Wayne Pivac, is taking over from Gatland. He was appointed after guiding the Scarlets to league success and a European Champions Cup semi-final, but he will face a rebuilding programme for the 2023 World Cup. He has a two-year break clause in his contract, along with his coaching team, which includes Stephen Jones, who took over as attack specialist from Robert Howley here, and while his style is different to Gatland\u2019s, laced with more adventure and risk-taking, he will need the ability of his predecessor to squeeze every last drop out of his players, finalise selection and detect potential. Wales\u2019s injuries here meant that their replacements against South Africa barely had more caps between them than Alun Wyn Jones, whose body will surely not last another four years, while Jonathan Davies, Liam Williams, George North, Dan Biggar, Leigh Halfpenny, Ken Owens and Justin Tipuric, Lions all, will probably need replacing by 2023. Pivac has a crop of young players who have gained experience in the past two years, including the flanker Ellis Jenkins, who missed this tournament through injury, but he will have to develop depth and be given time in a country not renowned for its patience: Gatland faced calls to be sacked two years after arriving. Wales, like Ireland, face transition under a new head coach at a time when England have reached the World Cup final while still on the up, unlike 2003 when they had peaked. England have the potential to dominate the Six Nations in the next four-year cycle, unless Fabien Galthi\u00e9 unites France\u2019s warring factions, with Eddie Jones having rebuilt his side over the last year. Gatland succeeded despite the system in Wales and Pivac, who has been here as an observer, will need to repeat the trick \u2013 or the heartache will come sooner.",

      "body": "<p>Anupama Chandrasekhar isn\u2019t one to shy away from a tough subject. The Indian playwright has written about acid attacks, sex tapes and her home country\u2019s culture of patriarchal violence. \u201cI have been asked so many times, mostly by men, \u2018Why don\u2019t you write comedies, or plays that celebrate India?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI tell them: on the day that these things don\u2019t happen any more, I will happily start writing bedroom farces.\u201d</p> <p>Her latest play, <a href=\"https://kilntheatre.com/whats-on/when-the-crows-visit/\">When the Crows Visit</a>, takes Ibsen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/25/ghosts-review-royal-derngate-northampton-mike-poulton\">Ghosts</a> as its inspiration. This may seem something of a departure, but Chandrasekhar found a surprising degree of affinity within the drama. \u201cHere is a white, male, Norwegian playwright from the 19th century,\u201d she says, \u201cand yet, as an Indian woman in Chennai in the 21st, I find so much resonance in his work.\u201d It is a brilliantly creepy play, building up tension and horror through the crows that bridge the worlds of the living and the dead.</p> <p>There is one vital \u2013 and shocking \u2013 twist in her splicing of India with Ibsen. The original featured Mrs Alving and her syphilitic son Oswald, grappling with the awful disease handed down from his father. But in When the Crows Visit, the toxic inheritance comes in the form of sexual violence against women.

Outside of the cities, it's just another incident \u2026 candlelit vigils don't happen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Chandrasekhar has an important reason to return to the Delhi rape. Sexual violence, she says, has become more rife in India since 2012, despite all the national and international hand-wringing that followed the case. \u201cIt was not a one-off incident. It has happened over and over again since, and has just become more gory, more brutal. But you can sense the media fatigue around the reporting of crimes against women.

The candlelit vigils don\u2019t happen for women in small towns and villages.\u201d</p> <p>The resurgence of violence in the country has coincided with the rebirth of its rightwing movement and this, says Chandrasekhar, is complicated by the conflict between modernity and conservatism. \u201cEven 30 or 40 years ago, Indian women were growing up freer than girls are now. My grandmother is a pre-independence woman.\u201d India gained its freedom from Britain in 1947. \u201cShe was brought up on the idealism that women are as important as men for the growth of the country.

      "bodyText": "Anupama Chandrasekhar isn\u2019t one to shy away from a tough subject. The Indian playwright has written about acid attacks, sex tapes and her home country\u2019s culture of patriarchal violence. \u201cI have been asked so many times, mostly by men, \u2018Why don\u2019t you write comedies, or plays that celebrate India?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI tell them: on the day that these things don\u2019t happen any more, I will happily start writing bedroom farces.\u201d Her latest play, When the Crows Visit, takes Ibsen\u2019s Ghosts as its inspiration. This may seem something of a departure, but Chandrasekhar found a surprising degree of affinity within the drama. \u201cHere is a white, male, Norwegian playwright from the 19th century,\u201d she says, \u201cand yet, as an Indian woman in Chennai in the 21st, I find so much resonance in his work.\u201d It is a brilliantly creepy play, building up tension and horror through the crows that bridge the worlds of the living and the dead. There is one vital \u2013 and shocking \u2013 twist in her splicing of India with Ibsen. The original featured Mrs Alving and her syphilitic son Oswald, grappling with the awful disease handed down from his father. But in When the Crows Visit, the toxic inheritance comes in the form of sexual violence against women. What\u2019s more, the mother figure, played by Ayesha Dharker, is both a victim of this violence and an enabler. One reference point in the play is the Delhi bus gang rape of 2012. Even though this takes place off stage, the horror is palpable, spreading through the script like a contagion. The play is directed by Indhu Rubasingham, artistic director at London\u2019s Kiln theatre, and as the three of us sit in her attic office we talk about turning such inflammatory material into charged drama.

Farrell and May suffered dead legs against the All Blacks while Sinckler hobbled off early in the second half. \u201c[Jonny May is] pretty good. We had a walk through this morning and we had to tell Jonny to slow down a bit,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe is probably in better condition that he was last week [when he had a hamstring injury] at this stage. Immeasurably better. Owen is a bit sore but he will be fine.

The crowds here generally at the World Cup have been fantastic and I thought our supporters on Saturday night were massively instrumental in getting us home.

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones has hit back at Warren Gatland after the Wales head coach had suggested England have peaked too early in their pursuit of the World Cup, telling his old sparring partner to \u201cenjoy the third-fourth place play-off\u201d. Jones also insisted that it was his players\u2019 job to \u201cmake the country happy\u201d amid ongoing Brexit strife back home and delivered a positive injury bulletin as England set about preparing for the first World Cup final for 12 years on Monday. Twenty-four hours after England demolished the All Blacks to install themselves as the world\u2019s No 1-ranked side and favourites for the World Cup, Wales were edged out by South Africa and will face New Zealand in the bronze medal match, a day before the final, in what will be Gatland\u2019s last match of his tenure. After their semi-final defeat Gatland praised England\u2019s performance but questioned whether Jones\u2019s side would be able to repeat the same levels of intensity a week later against the Springboks. \u201cWe have seen in previous World Cups that teams sometimes play their final in semi-finals and don\u2019t always turn up for a final,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cSo it will be interesting to see how England are next week and it could be a good game.\u201d The two coaches have often clashed over the last few years and when Gatland\u2019s comment was put to Jones, he replied: \u201cWell guys, can you just send my best wishes to Warren and make sure he enjoys the third-fourth place play-off. Jones added: \u201cWe played a great team on Saturday but we don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve played as well as we can and the challenge for us is to keep improving. And there\u2019s small margins now. As you go through the tournament, the margins get smaller. The improvements you can make are still significant \u2013 we\u2019re looking to see how we can keep improving for this week\u2019s game and that\u2019s the exciting part for us.\u2019 With England seeking the second World Cup title in their history on Saturday, Jones has also been boosted with Owen Farrell, Jonny May and Kyle Sinckler all passed fit to face the Springboks. Farrell and May suffered dead legs against the All Blacks while Sinckler hobbled off early in the second half. \u201c[Jonny May is] pretty good. We had a walk through this morning and we had to tell Jonny to slow down a bit,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe is probably in better condition that he was last week [when he had a hamstring injury] at this stage. Immeasurably better. Owen is a bit sore but he will be fine. We have got a few others carrying bumps and bruises because it was a tough old game.\u201d Meanwhile, amid reports of ticket prices for the final soaring to more than \u00a312,000 and a surge in demand for flights from the UK to Japan, Jones saluted his side\u2019s supporters and acknowledged England were giving fans a welcome distraction amid political chaos back in the UK. \u201cI think it\u2019s great, you give the country something to cheer about and with Brexit at the moment they probably need something to cheer about,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s a job of the team to make the country happy, not as happy as they can be, because there is still a game to go. The crowds here generally at the World Cup have been fantastic and I thought our supporters on Saturday night were massively instrumental in getting us home. Their singing, their general support of the team were fantastic and we urge them to keep doing that.\u201d England were on Monday still waiting to hear whether they would be fined for their V-shaped response to New Zealand\u2019s haka before their semi-final victory. England\u2019s players revealed that Jones was behind the plan to counter New Zealand\u2019s traditional Maori challenge in order to show they were \u201cready for anything\u201d and it had the desired effect with Manu Tuilagi opening the scoring after just 96 seconds. It is understood that England breached World Rugby\u2019s \u201ccultural ritual protocol\u201d however, with players crossing the halfway line while the haka was performed.

Contemporaries in the 1600s gossiped that Judith is Allori\u2019s cruel mistress, Maria de Giovanni Mazzafirri. The severed head is, of course, his own. For good measure, Judith\u2019s servant is Mazzafirri\u2019s mother whom he blamed for wrecking their relationship.</p> <p>Maybe \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun was one of the many people who fell for Emma Hamilton, the wife of the British ambassador to Naples and mistress of Nelson.

He even paid homage to the Renaissance cult of the art of love in a series of engravings of Raphael and his mistress La Fornarina. But in his violently carnal masterpiece, The Three Dancers, he tells a story of love gone wrong. Two of the figures represent his friends Ramon Pichot and his wife, Germaine Gargallo. The third is believed to be his youthful friend (and Gargallo\u2019s lover) Carlos Casagemas, who killed himself over Gargallo. Frida Kahlo was just as painfully confessional: in her 1943 Self-Portrait as a Tehuana, she has the face of her difficult love Diego Rivera tattooed on her forehead.</p> <p>If Van Dyck hid his affair with Isabella in her portrait, it is just one among many passionate stories hidden in the world\u2019s greatest art.</p>",

Maybe \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun was one of the many people who fell for Emma Hamilton, the wife of the British ambassador to Naples and mistress of Nelson. This aristocratic artist and close friend of Marie Antoinette portrayed Hamilton four times, including in the nude. Her portraits capture the sexuality that seduced Nelson much more powerfully than any paintings by men. In modern times, Picasso coded every detail of his love life in his art, using it to celebrate and punish the women in his life. He even paid homage to the Renaissance cult of the art of love in a series of engravings of Raphael and his mistress La Fornarina. But in his violently carnal masterpiece, The Three Dancers, he tells a story of love gone wrong. Two of the figures represent his friends Ramon Pichot and his wife, Germaine Gargallo. The third is believed to be his youthful friend (and Gargallo\u2019s lover) Carlos Casagemas, who killed himself over Gargallo. Frida Kahlo was just as painfully confessional: in her 1943 Self-Portrait as a Tehuana, she has the face of her difficult love Diego Rivera tattooed on her forehead. If Van Dyck hid his affair with Isabella in her portrait, it is just one among many passionate stories hidden in the world\u2019s greatest art.",

The appearance of bird eggs is rooted in two pigments, one of which is greenish and the other reddish-brown. Different concentrations of these pigments, together with the underlying white calcium carbonate of the shell, give rise to colours ranging from deep blue to greenish-white and rich brown. But what influences the appearance of the eggs that different birds lay has been a topic of hot debate, with theories including the need for camouflage from predators, mitigating the harmful effect of UV light on the embryo\u2019s DNA, helping birds recognise which eggs are theirs \u2013 and even that different colours may have different antimicrobial properties. Researchers say while these factors might still play a role \u2013 particularly at a local level \u2013 a key influence at a global scale is temperature. \u201cEggs in these colder places are darker brown and then as you go towards the tropics and even the temperate zone there are just more competing selection pressures, so there is more variation in colours,\u201d said Dr Daniel Hanley, a co-author of the study from Long Island University. With global temperatures rising, he said one concern was the impact on organisms such as birds that have traits adapted to particular climates. Writing in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, Hanley and colleagues report how they analysed the colour and brightness of one egg from each of 634 species of bird from around the globe, and looked at the breeding range for each species. The team then took the average for egg brightness and colour across the communities of birds in a given area and created a map of the results.

      "body": "<p>Northern Ireland has long been viewed as a \u201cplace apart\u201d within the United Kingdom. Now, unionists fear it is about to become a \u201cplace apart\u201d outside the UK: separated from Great Britain by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/16/the-irish-sea-border-what-does-it-mean-for-businesses-brexit\" title=\"\">new border in the Irish Sea</a>, pushed closer to the EU and, eventually, into a united Ireland. That\u2019s why they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/northern-ireland-unionist-mps-attack-brexit-betrayal\" title=\"\">unsettled right now</a>, and indeed fearful.</p> <p>Unionists have been here before. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1972/mar/25/past.ianaitken\" title=\"\">1972 their parliament at Stormont was prorogued</a>, and direct rule imposed from Westminster. In 1973 the British and Irish governments, with limited input from unionists, concluded the Sunningdale agreement, which replaced majority rule with mandatory power-sharing and an \u201cIrish dimension\u201d. A little over a decade later the British and Irish governments signed the Anglo-Irish agreement, which unionism regarded as a form of joint sovereignty. And in 1993 the Downing Street declaration stated the British government has no \u201cselfish strategic or economic interest\u201d in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Each of these moments represented an enormous political and psychological blow to unionism. Each was accompanied by huge anger and enormous rallies. Yet while there was a fear that unionism was being pushed in a direction it didn\u2019t want to go, Northern Ireland was still an integral and equal part of the UK. Similarly, while sections of unionism, including the DUP, initially rejected the Good Friday agreement in 1998, it was still possible to sustain the argument that Northern Ireland would remain fully within the UK until a majority of its citizens decided otherwise.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is an anger across all sections of unionism unseen since 1985 and which may prove very difficult to contain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/26/dup-arlene-foster-johnson-brexit-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal</a> is very different. If it emerges from the parliamentary debate and scrutiny stages with its Irish sections intact then Northern Ireland will cease to be a full and equal part of the UK. Yes, Johnson could still argue that it would require victory at a border poll for Northern Ireland to formally cease to be part of the UK, but unionists believe that beginning the process of easing the region out \u2013 as his deal does \u2013 makes it much easier for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/31/sinn-fein-border-poll-ireland-unity-must-follow-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">Irish nationalists to make their case for reunification</a>.</p> <p>This is a hammer blow for the DUP. It has propped up Conservative governments since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/26/the-conservativedup-deal-what-it-says-and-what-it-means\" title=\"\">June 2017</a> and its 10 votes have saved Theresa May and Boris Johnson on several occasions. The unionists, not surprisingly, believe they are \u201cowed\u201d for that confidence and expected Northern Ireland\u2019s constitutional status to be protected come what may. May let them down with the notorious backstop. And now Johnson has let them down. Even the hardline Brexiters of the European Research Group have abandoned the DUP. What makes it immeasurably worse for Arlene Foster\u2019s party is that it made such a song and dance about the influence it had with its friends in high places.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/20/grassroots-loyalists-brexit-deal-sellout-tensions-running-high\">Grassroots loyalists think this Brexit deal is a sell-out. That\u2019s why tensions are running so high | Henry Patterson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a bigger hammer blow for the rest of unionism, raising the extraordinarily awkward question: if the DUP has been \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the party it had kept in power (and whose key players, including Johnson, had come to Belfast to trumpet their loyalty to Ulster unionism) then whom can unionists now trust to protect their constitutional interests?</p> <p>So far, that question remains unanswered. Which is why some elements of unionism/loyalism (and while they remain small in number, they have a worrying potential to grow) seem determined to send \u201csome sort of message\u201d to Johnson, the Irish government and the EU. But it is very difficult to send a strong message without damaging their own argument; because it is their own sovereign parliament, to which they are so loyally attached, that is ultimately responsible for their predicament. Put bluntly, it\u2019s very difficult to bully your own national government into treating you \u201cequally\u201d when both your own government and, the evidence suggests, an overwhelming majority of your fellow citizens across Great Britain, seem to have no particular interest in sustaining a link with you.</p> <p>It was very noticeable at the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-50189349\" title=\"\">party conference</a> on Saturday how much time during speeches and at a fringe event was devoted to the importance of the union and the lengths the DUP would be prepared to go to shore it up and maximise support for it. Indeed, this focus on the union was the clearest possible sign that the party recognises the dilemma unionism is currently facing.</p> <p>There is today an anger across all sections of unionism which I haven\u2019t seen since 1985 (one mass rally at the time sparked DUP leader Ian Paisley\u2019s famous \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zSWlAHD29M\" title=\"\">Never! Never! Never!</a>\u201d speech). And, because Johnson\u2019s deal brings the end of the union closer than has any previous pact, it is an anger which may prove very difficult to contain. Which leaves the DUP with some problems: how does it contain the anger, restore its credibility within unionism, block Johnson\u2019s deal, and lessen the chances of an early poll on a united Ireland?</p> <p>One thing it now knows for certain is that it cannot trust Johnson: even if the prime minister tries to appease it with a lorry-load of reassurances. The party\u2019s priority must be to find a way of removing itself from the series of hooks it has placed itself on since June 2016, when it backed Brexit. And it will have to admit that the uber-unionist nonsense that accompanied its relationship with the ERG was a monumental miscalculation. For the DUP, as with all Northern Ireland unionist parties, the union eclipses every other issue. </p> <p>I suspect the DUP knows all this. Which means it also knows what it needs to do. There is no enthusiasm for Johnson\u2019s deal in Northern Ireland (the nationalists are hardly fans either \u2013 they strongly voted remain). Unionists will never agree to anything that changes the constitutional position so significantly. All of which can ultimately lead to only one conclusion: the DUP must now shift towards remain. It will have to \u2013 for its very survival.</p> <p>\u2022 Alex Kane is a former director of communications for the Ulster Unionist party</p>",

Now, unionists fear it is about to become a \u201cplace apart\u201d outside the UK: separated from Great Britain by a new border in the Irish Sea, pushed closer to the EU and, eventually, into a united Ireland. That\u2019s why they are unsettled right now, and indeed fearful. Unionists have been here before. In 1972 their parliament at Stormont was prorogued, and direct rule imposed from Westminster. In 1973 the British and Irish governments, with limited input from unionists, concluded the Sunningdale agreement, which replaced majority rule with mandatory power-sharing and an \u201cIrish dimension\u201d. A little over a decade later the British and Irish governments signed the Anglo-Irish agreement, which unionism regarded as a form of joint sovereignty. And in 1993 the Downing Street declaration stated the British government has no \u201cselfish strategic or economic interest\u201d in Northern Ireland. Each of these moments represented an enormous political and psychological blow to unionism. Each was accompanied by huge anger and enormous rallies. Yet while there was a fear that unionism was being pushed in a direction it didn\u2019t want to go, Northern Ireland was still an integral and equal part of the UK. Similarly, while sections of unionism, including the DUP, initially rejected the Good Friday agreement in 1998, it was still possible to sustain the argument that Northern Ireland would remain fully within the UK until a majority of its citizens decided otherwise. Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal is very different. If it emerges from the parliamentary debate and scrutiny stages with its Irish sections intact then Northern Ireland will cease to be a full and equal part of the UK. Yes, Johnson could still argue that it would require victory at a border poll for Northern Ireland to formally cease to be part of the UK, but unionists believe that beginning the process of easing the region out \u2013 as his deal does \u2013 makes it much easier for Irish nationalists to make their case for reunification. This is a hammer blow for the DUP. It has propped up Conservative governments since June 2017 and its 10 votes have saved Theresa May and Boris Johnson on several occasions. The unionists, not surprisingly, believe they are \u201cowed\u201d for that confidence and expected Northern Ireland\u2019s constitutional status to be protected come what may. May let them down with the notorious backstop. And now Johnson has let them down. Even the hardline Brexiters of the European Research Group have abandoned the DUP. What makes it immeasurably worse for Arlene Foster\u2019s party is that it made such a song and dance about the influence it had with its friends in high places. It is a bigger hammer blow for the rest of unionism, raising the extraordinarily awkward question: if the DUP has been \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the party it had kept in power (and whose key players, including Johnson, had come to Belfast to trumpet their loyalty to Ulster unionism) then whom can unionists now trust to protect their constitutional interests? So far, that question remains unanswered. Which is why some elements of unionism/loyalism (and while they remain small in number, they have a worrying potential to grow) seem determined to send \u201csome sort of message\u201d to Johnson, the Irish government and the EU. But it is very difficult to send a strong message without damaging their own argument; because it is their own sovereign parliament, to which they are so loyally attached, that is ultimately responsible for their predicament. Put bluntly, it\u2019s very difficult to bully your own national government into treating you \u201cequally\u201d when both your own government and, the evidence suggests, an overwhelming majority of your fellow citizens across Great Britain, seem to have no particular interest in sustaining a link with you. It was very noticeable at the party conference on Saturday how much time during speeches and at a fringe event was devoted to the importance of the union and the lengths the DUP would be prepared to go to shore it up and maximise support for it. Indeed, this focus on the union was the clearest possible sign that the party recognises the dilemma unionism is currently facing. There is today an anger across all sections of unionism which I haven\u2019t seen since 1985 (one mass rally at the time sparked DUP leader Ian Paisley\u2019s famous \u201cNever! Never! Never!\u201d speech). And, because Johnson\u2019s deal brings the end of the union closer than has any previous pact, it is an anger which may prove very difficult to contain. Which leaves the DUP with some problems: how does it contain the anger, restore its credibility within unionism, block Johnson\u2019s deal, and lessen the chances of an early poll on a united Ireland? One thing it now knows for certain is that it cannot trust Johnson: even if the prime minister tries to appease it with a lorry-load of reassurances. The party\u2019s priority must be to find a way of removing itself from the series of hooks it has placed itself on since June 2016, when it backed Brexit. And it will have to admit that the uber-unionist nonsense that accompanied its relationship with the ERG was a monumental miscalculation. For the DUP, as with all Northern Ireland unionist parties, the union eclipses every other issue. I suspect the DUP knows all this. Which means it also knows what it needs to do. There is no enthusiasm for Johnson\u2019s deal in Northern Ireland (the nationalists are hardly fans either \u2013 they strongly voted remain). Unionists will never agree to anything that changes the constitutional position so significantly. All of which can ultimately lead to only one conclusion: the DUP must now shift towards remain. It will have to \u2013 for its very survival. \u2022 Alex Kane is a former director of communications for the Ulster Unionist party",

The best eight players in 2019 will be battling throughout the week, and there are few better prospects than this upcoming battle between Bianca Andreescu and Simona Halep. </p> <p>No 4 Andreescu has been <em>the</em> sensation at the top of the game in 2019, breaking through in March with her title at Indian Wells as a wildcard, then stamping her spot at the top of the game when Angelique Keber infamously called her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjF2axTw1Fg\">\u201cthe biggest drama queen ever\u201d</a>. After struggling with a bad shoulder injury, she only played one match the following four months. Upon her return, she immediately win the Rogers Cup at home in Canada before winning her first grand slam title at the US Open. Her win-loss record is an astounding 48-5.</p> <p>On the other hand, No 5 Simona Halep has been here before. This is her sixth(!) straight appearance at the WTA finals in 2014 and she has been by far the most consistent player in this period. This year she backed up last year\u2019s cathartic, long awaited Roland Garros title by beating Serena Williams to win the Wimbledon title on her \u2018worst\u2019 surface. However, she has been struggling with a back injury recently. We\u2019ll see if she\u2019s up to it.</p> <p>This should be a good one, so please feel free to drop an email <a href=\"mailto:tumaini.carayol@theguardian.com\">tumaini.carayol@theguardian.com</a> or tweet me at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tumcarayol\">@tumcarayol</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/26/wta-finals-shenzhen-womens-tennis-richest-event-history-troubling-backdrop\">Women\u2019s tennis takes victory lap in China despite troubling backdrop | Tumaini Carayol</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-28T12:52:21.259Z\">at 12.52pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me today, but what a fun, physical first meeting that was between Halep and Andreescu. The youngster burst through and shone bright, but the veteran showed why she is where she is. Hopefully this is the first of many meetings between them. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow for Osaka-Barty and Kvitova-Bencic. Until then. Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) 3-6 Halep: Simona Halep snatches a brilliant win in a gripping match. Andreescu was sublime for the first set, showing her full blinding arsenal of shots but that match was a measure of how tough Halep is to beat when she wants to these days. Many players can hit through her for a set and a bit, but can you do it across three sets? You have to hope that Andreescu\u2019s back is okay. Despite losing, the set she won bodes well for the rest of the round robin tournament. Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) *3-5 Halep: Well, well, well. Simona Halep will serve for the victory. Andreescu looks completely spent and Halep is still grinding her down with every shot of every long rally. A wicked dipping crosscourt forehand passing shot from Halep at 30-30 before another long rally forced the break. Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) *3-4 Halep: Andreescu doesn\u2019t need to look in great shape to win tennis matches though. Too many puffball second serves from Halep, and Andreescu is able to shorten the points. She finishes with a wicked crosscourt forehand return winner and here we are. Back on serve. Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) *2-4 Halep: Halep is doing some insane things on defence at the moment. At 15-15, she chases down a couple of sizzling Andreescu backhands, before snapping a backhand crosscourt winner of her own. Then she anticipates correctly on a backhand putaway from the Canadian and drills the passing shot crosscourt. She breaks with a solid defensive lob, with Andreescu dumping the smash into the net. Andreescu doesn\u2019t look good right now. Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) *2-3 Halep: Simona Halep recovers from 0-30 down to move up in the third set. A solid service game sealed with a great wrong-footing forehand winner. Meanwhile, Andreescu has the trainer out again for her back. She certainly isn\u2019t moving well at the moment. Here is one such ridiculous shot from Andreescu. Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) 2-2* Halep: It must be noted that Halep did indeed move forward\u2026 and she shanked the drive volley long on the second point of this game. However, Halep was solid enough to get the break by taking an Andreescu moonball early and crushing a forehand winner. Weird play from Andreescu right now. She\u2019s just going for everything and rolling through her vast arsenal without much thought. Some absolutely insane winners are coming from her racquet, but also plenty of errors. Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) *2-1 Halep: Again, we have seen Andreescu recover after looking down and out so frequently this year. Those errors from Halep have awoken the beast: Andreescu snapped a breathtaking forehand return winner at full stretch from 0-15, then she pushed Halep back with moonballs before stepping in and snapping a forehand winner at 15-15. At 15-40, Andreescu hit a brilliant dropshot and did just enough with the forehand passing shot to take the game. Darren Cahill is back on and he is practically begging Halep to move into the court and take on more drive volleys. We\u2019ll see if she does. Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) 1-1* Halep: That was\u2026 unimpressive from Simona Halep. Andreescu was spraying errors to move down 15-30 and still looked extremely shaky, but Halep went for two low percentage shots at full stretch, spraying a forehand wide and then a backhand into the net. Andreescu holds. Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) *0-1 Halep: Andreescu looks quite weary and is trying to shorten points even more than earlier, but we\u2019ve seen this many times before from Andreescu yet she has only lost 5 matches this year. Halep is more than happy to see more unforced errors and edges ahead. Andreescu is taking a medical timeout for her back/hip now. Second set tiebreak: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) Halep: Simona Halep saves a match point to force Andreescu to a third set! The level is sky-high here, with Halep\u2019s defence just making the difference in the tiebreak. She retrieved so many defensive shots with quality and depth, and forced Andreescu into going for too much. The set ended with a wild second serve return from Andreescu. This has been an experience. Second set tiebreak: Andreescu 6-3 6-6 (6-7*) Halep: Some absolutely immense defence from Simona Halep to build up a *6-4 lead, but she misses a bold down the line forehand at 6-4. Andreescu saves the second set point with a forehand volley winner. Another set point coming up for Halep though... Second set tiebreak: Andreescu 6-3 6-6 (3-3) Halep: Halep suddenly looked like the calmer player, moving up 3-0 in the tiebreak. But with her back against the wall, Andreescu snapped a huge forehand winner and came right back for 3-3. This is so tight. Second set: Andreescu 6-3 6-6 Halep: What a hold by Simona Halep! After immense pressure, copious dropshots and some brutal rallies won by the young Canadian, she brings up her first match point. Halep saves the match point with some brilliant defence before immediately flipping to offence and forcing an error with a great backhand crosscourt. Shortly after, Halep snaps a gutsy backhand down the line winner told hold again. Bold. Second set: Andreescu 6-3 6-5* Halep: An easy hold for Andreescu to pile the pressure back on the Romanian. She closed it off so impressively: she absolutely crushed a crosscourt forehand winner, then landed a delicate forehand dropshot as Halep braced herself far behind the baseline for another violent body blow, then closed with an unreturned first serve. Second set: Andreescu 6-3 *5-5 Halep: Halep gets herself back on track at just the right time. Some great depth from Halep, who painted the baseline a couple of times and forced errors out of Andreescu. This is very tight. Second set: Andreescu 6-3 5-4* Halep: Andreescu edges ahead and the Romanian will now serve to stay in the match. Wasteful from Halep, who twice had an easy short forehand to finish the point. She dumped the first into the net, then went straight back at Andreescu on the second, who rolled a backhand passing shot past her. Some solid serving from Andreescu and she is a game away. Second set: Andreescu 6-3 *4-4 Halep: Andreescu has a tendency to whack her shin with her racquet, and she has now drawn blood. But on-court, it was actually Halep who was bleeding errors in that game. Despite Cahill imploring her to attack her second serve ,it\u2019s sitting up a little too much and Andreescu is taking advantage. Medical timeout for Andreescu to address her shin. Cahill is back on: \u201cStay in there mentally and don\u2019t get down on yourself.\u201d Second set: Andreescu 6-3 3-4* Halep: Andreescu pieces together a nice regulation hold, but a winning tweener at 30-0 stole the show. Rather than a bit of showboating, it seemed like Andreescu got a little tangled up, but when your hands are that good you can adjust. Coach Darren Cahill is on court for Halep. He\u2019s very happy with her getting Andreescu on the move and opening up the court. He tells her to keep on trying to push the Canadian back with her second serve. We\u2019ll see if she can. Second set: Andreescu 6-3 *2-4 Halep: This time, Simona Halep consolidates her break with a hold but that was tough. Halep moved up 40-0 and seemed to be coasting, but then Andreescu pieced together three great points, winning two long exchanges and snapping one great forehand return. But once again it\u2019s Halep\u2019s serve that keeps her out of trouble. Two unreturned first serves from deuce givers the Romanian a hold. Slick. Second set: Andreescu 6-3 2-3* Halep: Simona Halep\u2019s tenaciousness has been impressive so far in set two. She is not controlling a lot of the play out here, but she continues to land returns deep, keep her consistent level and force Andreescu to put the ball past her frequently. She couldn\u2019t this time, hitting three unforced errors for Halep to move up a break once more. Second set: Andreescu 6-3 *2-2 Halep: Andreescu\u2019s weakness may be her concentration, but she is also so good at bouncing back. She gets the break back immediately. A slick angled drop volley at 0-30 from Andreescu, then she broke back with a stinging forehand crosscourt return. Second set: Andreescu 6-3 1-2* Halep: Andreescu\u2019s one weakness this year has been her tendency to lose concentration and go off the boil a little during matches. A series of errors from Andreescu, including a double fault at 15-30, and a solid Simona Halep is up a break in set two. Second set: Andreescu 6-3 *1-1 Halep: You won\u2019t see another service game like that from Simona Halep for a long, long time. The diminutive Romanian just held with two straight aces. She will take that every day of the week. Second set: Andreescu 6-3 1-0* Halep: Absolutely no let-up from Andreescu to start the second set. Halep spent a lot of time trying to break down the Canadian\u2019s backhand, but Andreescu is so good at throwing in a loopy ball or a slice and finding a big forehand again. Let\u2019s see if she can sustain this level. First set: Andreescu 6-3 Halep: That was quite an incredible set of tennis from Bianca Andreescu, who was absolutely dominant aside from one two-game stretch of excellence from the Romanian. Andreescu has dominated the exchanges, both by being the aggressor and constantly changing the pace. She\u2019s throwing in loopy high balls, drop shots, you name it. Halep isn\u2019t playing badly at all but she hasn\u2019t been able to stay with the Canadian. First set: Andreescu 5-3* Halep: Andreescu throws down another love hold, this time sealed with an ace. Cahill suggested taking on her backhand down the line and going after the early balls a little more, but it\u2019s so tough when Andreescu is putting her under this much pressure. Meanwhile, Coach Darren Cahill is back on-court with Halep. He was due to officially join her team again in the new season after taking a break this year, but clearly they just couldn\u2019t wait. First set: Andreescu *4-3 Halep: The one constant so far has been Andreescu relentlessly attacking the Halep second serve. But after wasting two more break points, Andreescu mixes in a few slices and forces an error to break again. First set: Andreescu 3-3* Halep: No problems for Andreescu after losing two games in a row. She absolutely crushed a few forehands, landed some first serves and held to love. First set: Andreescu *2-3 Halep: Both women are starting to thrive now and the rallies are tough. Andreescu absolutely obliterated a couple of Halep\u2019s serves to bring up 0-40, then Halep erased the danger with some quality counterpunching. Incredible work from Halep at deuce - she soaked up a series of big forehands, retrieved an Andreescu overhead and then immediately flipped the point, finishing with a forehand winner. First set: Andreescu 2-2* Halep: Well, it appears that Simona Halep has arrived. Some tough rallies end with Halep passing Andreescu at the net twice. First she easily retrieved an Andreescu dropshot, then held her ground and redirected a big Andreescu forehand past the Canadian at the net. High quality stuff. First set: Andreescu *2-1 Halep: Andreescu snatches the first break and she is already looking so sharp. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s the Canadian who is controlling most of these points early on and dictating the pace of the rallies. She hits a brilliant winning dropshot and then crushed a great inside-out forehand winner at 30-30. Halep isn\u2019t dealing with her weight of shot well so far. First set: Andreescu 1-1* Halep: Andreescu levels up immediately, holding to 15. A couple of huge forehands from Andreescu, who is already serving big. First set: Andreescu *0-1 Halep: As expected, Andreescu us already showing off her variety. She opened the match by narrowly missing a volley the net, then slipped in a slick drop shot winner. Despite being pushed to deuce, Halep rallies out a deuce game to get her first hold. How will this match be won? Good question. The most striking part of Andreescu\u2019s rise has been her style of play. She already possesses one of the biggest forehands in the world, she moves well, she returns extremely well and she can be really aggressive. But it\u2019s her variety that has really set her apart she\u2019ll throw in dropshots, loopy balls, net forays and she\u2019ll try to break Halep\u2019s rhythm Halep will have to soak up all of that pace and variety and she may look to move Andreescu with her angles. But this will be their first ever match-up so it will be fascinating to see how they try to outmanoeuvre and outthink each other. If Andreescu\u2019s surname didn\u2019t make it clear, the most notable aspect of this match-up is that Andreescu\u2019s parents are Romanian. She spent some of her youth in Romania, speaks the language and proudly represents both parts of her heritage. Naturally, she considers Halep her idol. When Andreescu was younger, she spoke with Halep in Romanian, who gave her some advice that she has never forgotten. It is a conversation that Halep has had to recount many times this year: \u201cYeah, I just told her that she has to stop juniors because she\u2019s strong enough to make the step,\u201d said Halep \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what she has done. To win a Grand Slam at 19, play few tournaments and win them, it\u2019s a great, great job. I just want to tell her that she deserved because she played really well these tournaments.\u201d Hello!

In a highly critical attack on the papacy\u2019s stonewalling response to decades of complaints, the lead counsel to the inquiry, Brian Altman QC, said it was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d that significant evidence and statements had been withheld.

At the start of its final, two week-long hearing into abuse within the Catholic church, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) detailed how it sought help from the UK Foreign Office to obtain answers from the Holy See to its questions. The inquiry is keen, in particular, to discover more about the role of the church\u2019s Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), which is supposed to discipline priests who commit offences.

That is a sobering perspective for us to take.\u201d Altman remarked to the inquiry panel: \u201cYou may wish to consider why, apparently, it was not until February 2019 that Cardinal Nichols \u2019began to see\u2019 what they were talking about from the perspective of the victim/survivor.\u201d Altman added: \u201cThe Holy See\u2019s refusal to provide the inquiry with all the evidence it has sought is very disappointing \u2026 Pope Francis [recently] acknowledged the \u2018physical, psychological and spiritual damage\u2019 done to the victims of child sexual abuse, and added that \u2018a continuous and profound conversion of hearts is needed, attested by concrete and effective actions that involve everyone in the church\u2019\u201d. Altman told the chair of the inquiry, Prof Alexis Jay, that she \u201cmay consider that it is difficult to reconcile the Pope\u2019s own words with the Holy See\u2019s response to the requests properly made to it by this inquiry.\u201d The papal nuncio, the Vatican\u2019s diplomatic representative in the UK, is Edward Adams. He was asked to cooperate in handing over evidence gathered by his office in 2011 and 2012 about allegations of abuse of pupils at St Benedict\u2019s school and Ealing Abbey in west London. \u201cLet me make perfectly clear,\u201d Altman said, \u201cthat the inquiry went through established diplomatic channels and all proper procedures, including seeking assistance and advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, despite which no statements have been provided to the inquiry by the Holy See.\u201d Last week, IICSA published a report into the \u201csadistic and predatory\u201d atmosphere and culture of cover-up and denial at St Benedict\u2019s school that allowed sexual abusers to commit crimes against children for decades. The hearing continues.",

      "bodyText": "John Oliver criticised Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull out US troops from the Syrian-Turkish border and examined the many problems that have arisen as a result. On Last Week Tonight, the British comic referred to Trump as \u201cthe first president elected without any prior experience as a human being\u201d before he played footage of him bragging about the killing of the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Oliver said that Trump \u201cdescribed it in the weirdest possible way\u201d before rewinding to examine the controversial decision to stop helping Kurdish forces on the border between Syria and Turkey. Oliver called it a catastrophe that has been \u201cuniversally condemned\u201d before explaining that nearly 180,000 people have since been displaced and 120 civilians have been killed. Trump later explained that the Kurds didn\u2019t help in the second world war, to which Oliver asked: \u201cWhat the fuck does that have to do with anything?\u201d He also used examples of conflicts where the Kurds did help the US before stating: \u201cThe Kurds fought with the US military in at least two more wars than Donald Trump ever fucking did.\u201d Trump has also since said that he didn\u2019t want to spend more time in Syria, a place of sand and death. \u201cSince when does Trump avoid areas with sand and death?

First up, an admirable post from steevieb, who has had a change of heart about Elizabeth Strout\u2019s Olive Kitteridge: Some time ago (years) I began reading Olive Kitteridge. Just couldn\u2019t get on with it though, got bored with the small town America bit. Last week I decided to give it another go, I am so glad I did, totally blew me away, beautifully written, I loved every page so much that I immediately bought Amy and Isabelle, which to me was even better. How I could have been bored by it (Olive K) the first time around is a puzzle. Moods, I guess. Tom Mooney has also been rereading some classics: Hemingway\u2019s The Old Man and the Sea, not for the first time. It is wonderful, perfect even. I found some of it a little tougher to read this time, particularly the killing of the sharks (I had been reading a LOT of Cormac McCarthy around the time I read it before so was likely very desensitised!) but it stands up magnificently to repeated reading. I must be in the mood for old stuff as I also recently reread The Swimmer, John Cheever\u2019s glorious masterpiece of a short story. It\u2019s one of my all-time favourites and shows what a sharp writer he was. Night Waking by Sarah Moss has satisfied BobHammond2: Set on the fictional Scottish island of Colonsay, academic Anna is trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood, marriage, her academic career and a fair amount of sleep deprivation - and then a mystery around a baby\u2019s skeleton buried outside her house on the island. Overlaid on top of this is a separate timeline where we see, throughout the book, a series of letters written by a midwife sent to the island back in the late 1800s to improve infant mortality. So, Moss has a lot to juggle but she does it brilliantly and the two separate stories and all the loose threads are brought together at the end of the book for a very satisfying conclusion. fuzzywuzz has enjoyed The Body by Bill Bryson: What a marvellous adventure I have been on, taking a tour of the various organ systems within a human being. Although I studied biochemistry and physiology in my student days, I have learned some interesting new things and revisited already known facts. What I particularly like about Bryson\u2019s style here is that he has taken some complex subject areas such as immunology and transfusion science and distilled them into something which can be mentally digested by those without a scientific background and does so without patronising the reader. ID673795 has enjoyed Caravan of the Lost and Left Behind by Deirdre Shanahan: The story of a woman traveller and her son returning from chaotic lives in England to live on a traveller\u2019s site in Ireland with her father, where she also hopes to find her daughter, left there as a baby. The landscape is beautifully described and the story very sad but in the end hopeful. BanjoGuru has just finished But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer \u201cwhich I enjoyed a lot\u201d: I was expecting straight biographies of some jazz greats, but it\u2019s an altogether stranger beast - part imagined, part true, full of shifting perspectives and illusions and some really perceptive and evocative prose. I can recommend it if you like jazz, or even if you don\u2019t. Rajeev Balasubramanyam\u2019s Professor Chandra Follows His Bliss has impressed WildIrish: Now this is a funny and wise book.

Matt Salinger talks to the New York Times about opening up his father\u2019s archive to the public.

She replied that it needed to be: being online made time pass more quickly for passengers, and is preferable to sleeping.</p> <p>Why? Coupland suggests we\u2019ve undergone a neural reconfiguration in the 21st century. In 1019, he claims, humans received three-and-a-half dopamine hits a day. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/04/has-dopamine-got-us-hooked-on-tech-facebook-apps-addiction\">nicknamed the Kim Kardashian of molecules</a> by British clinical psychologist Vaughan Bell. It creates feelings of pleasure that motivate a person to repeat a specific behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cA thousand years later, we receive hundreds, thousands, of dopamine hits a day,\u201d argues Coupland. \u201cThe part of our brain that regulates our time perception has been overloaded and exhausted, causing our sense of past, present and future to melt together.\u201d </p> <p>An urgent new exhibition called <a href=\"https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/247\">24/7: A Wake Up Call for Our Non-Stop World</a> explores this culture in which we sleep less, consume content via screens at all hours, disconnect from our surroundings and have our every interaction data-mined and predicted. </p> <p>Fifty artists have been asked respond to the causes and consequences of this culture and how we could combat it. For Jet Slag: Around the World in Seven Sleeps, Alice Vandeleur-Boorer took part in a sleep-deprivation study, living in a lab for 10 days without natural light or knowledge of the time, and advancing her body clock by four hours a night in order to sleep outside the normal 24-hour circadian rhythm. Her photographs and data graphs show the disturbingly disorientating effects the experiment had on her.</p> <p>As for Coupland, he has produced a series of posters called <a href=\"https://www.cca.qc.ca/en/events/62768/slogans-for-the-twenty-first-century\">Slogans for the 21st Century</a>. \u201cExplain clocks to someone from 1304,\u201d goes one.

      "bodyText": "Thirty-thousand feet over the Pacific, the author and artist Douglas Coupland asked a flight attendant why the airline\u2019s wi-fi was so impressively fast. She replied that it needed to be: being online made time pass more quickly for passengers, and is preferable to sleeping. Why? Coupland suggests we\u2019ve undergone a neural reconfiguration in the 21st century. In 1019, he claims, humans received three-and-a-half dopamine hits a day. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter nicknamed the Kim Kardashian of molecules by British clinical psychologist Vaughan Bell. It creates feelings of pleasure that motivate a person to repeat a specific behaviour. \u201cA thousand years later, we receive hundreds, thousands, of dopamine hits a day,\u201d argues Coupland. \u201cThe part of our brain that regulates our time perception has been overloaded and exhausted, causing our sense of past, present and future to melt together.\u201d An urgent new exhibition called 24/7: A Wake Up Call for Our Non-Stop World explores this culture in which we sleep less, consume content via screens at all hours, disconnect from our surroundings and have our every interaction data-mined and predicted. Fifty artists have been asked respond to the causes and consequences of this culture and how we could combat it. For Jet Slag: Around the World in Seven Sleeps, Alice Vandeleur-Boorer took part in a sleep-deprivation study, living in a lab for 10 days without natural light or knowledge of the time, and advancing her body clock by four hours a night in order to sleep outside the normal 24-hour circadian rhythm. Her photographs and data graphs show the disturbingly disorientating effects the experiment had on her. As for Coupland, he has produced a series of posters called Slogans for the 21st Century. \u201cExplain clocks to someone from 1304,\u201d goes one. Elsewhere are \u201cInsomnia is bad for business\u201d and \u201cShopping while sleeping is a fascinating idea.\u201d All are aimed at shaking us from our dogmatic slumbers about how the 24/7 world is changing us.

Angela Kelly, the Queen\u2019s dresser for a quarter of a century, has set the record straight in her book: The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe.</p> <p>It was pure coincidence, Kelly states in her book, said to have been personally approved by the Queen, and<a href=\"https://www.hellomagazine.com/fashion/royal-style/2019102879758/queen-eu-hat-truth-revealed/\"> serialised in Hello! magazine</a>.</p> <p>Of the hat, Kelly writes \u201cit never occurred to her\u201d or to milliner Stella McLaren that the hat would be compared to the EU flag, which consists of a circle of 12 yellow stars against a blue background.</p> <p>The Queen had worn the hat after opting to wear day dress instead of the traditional robe and imperial state crown to the state opening in June 2017, which because of the snap general election was scaled down as it took place only four days after trooping the colour.</p> <p>It also fell during Royal Ascot, a sacrosanct engagement in the royal diary, and so the outfit enabled the Queen to facilitate a quick wardrobe change before trotting off to the races.</p> <p>Kelly said: \u201cI had already had in stock some material suitable for Her Majesty\u2019s outfit, so after I\u2019d checked the background against which the Queen would be sitting \u2013 to be sure the colours wouldn\u2019t clash \u2013 I made the design and passed it, with my instructions, to the in-house dressmaker.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly and the milliner then discussed how to top off the outfit, and decided on a Breton-brim block-style hat so that the Queen\u2019s face could be clearly seen.</p> <p>The eventual design featured five flowers made from feathers with tiny seed pearls painted in yellow.</p> <p>\u201cIt never occurred to Stella and me that people might think we were copying the European Union flag,\u201d insisted Kelly. \u201cIt was a coincidence but, boy, did it attract a lot of attention, and it certainly made us smile\u201d.</p> <p>It is not the only time the Queen\u2019s outfit has been deemed to convey a subliminal message. During the 2018 visit of the US president, Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jul/18/was-the-queen-sending-coded-messages-to-donald-trump-via-her-brooches-absolutely\">great significance was placed on her choice of brooches</a>: the first had been gifted by his predecessor, Barack Obama; the second by Canada, with whom Trump was not best pleased; and the third had previously been worn by her mother, Queen Elizabeth, at the funeral of her father, George VI.

      "bodyText": "The Queen\u2019s wardrobe is often interpreted as relaying coded messages from a monarch constitutionally bound to remain mute on political issues of the day. So when she wore a bold blue hat with yellow flowers bearing an uncanny resemblance to the EU flag during the state opening of parliament in 2017, many thought it carried serious import. Could it be, Twitter asked that Her Majesty was a remainer? The image even prompted Guy Verhofstadt , the European parliament lead negotiator on Brexit, to tweet: \u201cClearly the EU still inspires some in the UK\u201d. Alas, the truth, it would appear, is more mundane. Angela Kelly, the Queen\u2019s dresser for a quarter of a century, has set the record straight in her book: The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe. It was pure coincidence, Kelly states in her book, said to have been personally approved by the Queen, and serialised in Hello! magazine. Of the hat, Kelly writes \u201cit never occurred to her\u201d or to milliner Stella McLaren that the hat would be compared to the EU flag, which consists of a circle of 12 yellow stars against a blue background. The Queen had worn the hat after opting to wear day dress instead of the traditional robe and imperial state crown to the state opening in June 2017, which because of the snap general election was scaled down as it took place only four days after trooping the colour. It also fell during Royal Ascot, a sacrosanct engagement in the royal diary, and so the outfit enabled the Queen to facilitate a quick wardrobe change before trotting off to the races. Kelly said: \u201cI had already had in stock some material suitable for Her Majesty\u2019s outfit, so after I\u2019d checked the background against which the Queen would be sitting \u2013 to be sure the colours wouldn\u2019t clash \u2013 I made the design and passed it, with my instructions, to the in-house dressmaker.\u201d Kelly and the milliner then discussed how to top off the outfit, and decided on a Breton-brim block-style hat so that the Queen\u2019s face could be clearly seen. The eventual design featured five flowers made from feathers with tiny seed pearls painted in yellow. \u201cIt never occurred to Stella and me that people might think we were copying the European Union flag,\u201d insisted Kelly. \u201cIt was a coincidence but, boy, did it attract a lot of attention, and it certainly made us smile\u201d. It is not the only time the Queen\u2019s outfit has been deemed to convey a subliminal message. During the 2018 visit of the US president, Donald Trump, great significance was placed on her choice of brooches: the first had been gifted by his predecessor, Barack Obama; the second by Canada, with whom Trump was not best pleased; and the third had previously been worn by her mother, Queen Elizabeth, at the funeral of her father, George VI. Just what was Her Majesty trying to say?",

      "body": "<p>Earlier this month, Tiffany Cab\u00e1n stood on a stage in Queensbridge Park, New York City, and told roughly 26,000 Bernie Sanders supporters that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had inspired her to run for office. This year, Cab\u00e1n, a 31-year-old public defender, ran in the Democratic primary for Queens district attorney on a platform calling for serious criminal justice reform. Cab\u00e1n lost by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/nyregion/melinda-katz-caban-queens-da.html\">the slimmest of margins, 60 votes</a>, to the Queens borough president, Melissa Katz, the favorite of the Queens political machine and its real-estate developer patrons.</p> <p>The massive crowd had gathered in Queens because Ocasio-Cortez had endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. The Sanders campaign had bet on the so-called \u201cAOC effect\u201d buoying his candidacy, and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s political clout was on full display that afternoon. But the real evidence that the \u201cAOC effect\u201d will deliver returns for Democrats and progressives in coming years is not in Sanders\u2019 resilience but in the power of local progressives like Cab\u00e1n, who are changing expectations about what is possible in their cities and states nationwide.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/23/think-americas-fate-hinges-on-the-2020-presidential-race-youre-forgetting-something\">Think America's fate hinges on the 2020 presidential race? You're forgetting something | Meaghan Winter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It goes without saying that Ocasio-Cortez is both a catalyst and result of the left\u2019s invigoration since 2016. Nationwide, many other primary challengers have attempted to unseat Democratic incumbents they say are milquetoast or bought off by corporate donors. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, many have lost their primary bids. If we think short-term, those candidates failed.</p> <p>But if we think long-term, those progressive challengers have paved the way for future wins. Dozens of progressive challengers have already filed to run against Democratic congressional incumbents in 2020. Many more are challenging incumbents at the city and state level. It is too soon to say how those challengers will fare, or what effect they will have on Democrats\u2019 chances of regaining power in the immediate term. But the long-term success of the Democratic party, the progressive movement and the nation will only be sharpened by primary challengers who stake out a moral ground and speak plainly about how much we have to lose if we don\u2019t repair our corrupt political system.</p> <p>For years, Democratic party officials and candidates across the country have relied on corporate patrons such as energy companies. As a result, many Democratic incumbents, along with their Republican colleagues, have obliged their donors and stymied legislative action on problems such as climate change. Progressive challengers are making sure that nobody takes that for granted any more.</p> <p>Take the candidacy of Yasmine Taeb in Virginia. This year, in the Democratic primary, Taeb ran against Dick Saslaw, who has represented Virginia\u2019s 35th district in the state senate since 1980 and hadn\u2019t faced a primary challenger since that first race. Saslaw, the state senate minority leader, has received <a href=\"https://www.vpap.org/candidates/47/donor/120206/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all&amp;contrib_type=all\">at least $363,000 in donations from the state\u2019s largest utility energy company</a> and a major political donor, Dominion Energy. Taeb made Saslaw\u2019s cozy relationship with Dominion a central theme of her campaign.</p> <p>Saslaw eked out a win with 48.6% of the primary votes. But Taeb helped achieve something important: last month, the Virginia Democratic party announced that it would no longer accept donations from energy utilities like Dominion.</p> <p>The change did not come from Taeb\u2019s candidacy alone. Like Ocasio-Cortez, Taeb was one person working within a movement. For years now, activist groups like Activate Virginia have been agitating to get Dominion money out of politics.

      "bodyText": "Earlier this month, Tiffany Cab\u00e1n stood on a stage in Queensbridge Park, New York City, and told roughly 26,000 Bernie Sanders supporters that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had inspired her to run for office. This year, Cab\u00e1n, a 31-year-old public defender, ran in the Democratic primary for Queens district attorney on a platform calling for serious criminal justice reform. Cab\u00e1n lost by the slimmest of margins, 60 votes, to the Queens borough president, Melissa Katz, the favorite of the Queens political machine and its real-estate developer patrons. The massive crowd had gathered in Queens because Ocasio-Cortez had endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. The Sanders campaign had bet on the so-called \u201cAOC effect\u201d buoying his candidacy, and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s political clout was on full display that afternoon. But the real evidence that the \u201cAOC effect\u201d will deliver returns for Democrats and progressives in coming years is not in Sanders\u2019 resilience but in the power of local progressives like Cab\u00e1n, who are changing expectations about what is possible in their cities and states nationwide. It goes without saying that Ocasio-Cortez is both a catalyst and result of the left\u2019s invigoration since 2016. Nationwide, many other primary challengers have attempted to unseat Democratic incumbents they say are milquetoast or bought off by corporate donors. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, many have lost their primary bids. If we think short-term, those candidates failed. But if we think long-term, those progressive challengers have paved the way for future wins. Dozens of progressive challengers have already filed to run against Democratic congressional incumbents in 2020. Many more are challenging incumbents at the city and state level. It is too soon to say how those challengers will fare, or what effect they will have on Democrats\u2019 chances of regaining power in the immediate term. But the long-term success of the Democratic party, the progressive movement and the nation will only be sharpened by primary challengers who stake out a moral ground and speak plainly about how much we have to lose if we don\u2019t repair our corrupt political system. For years, Democratic party officials and candidates across the country have relied on corporate patrons such as energy companies. As a result, many Democratic incumbents, along with their Republican colleagues, have obliged their donors and stymied legislative action on problems such as climate change. Progressive challengers are making sure that nobody takes that for granted any more. Take the candidacy of Yasmine Taeb in Virginia. This year, in the Democratic primary, Taeb ran against Dick Saslaw, who has represented Virginia\u2019s 35th district in the state senate since 1980 and hadn\u2019t faced a primary challenger since that first race. Saslaw, the state senate minority leader, has received at least $363,000 in donations from the state\u2019s largest utility energy company and a major political donor, Dominion Energy. Taeb made Saslaw\u2019s cozy relationship with Dominion a central theme of her campaign. Saslaw eked out a win with 48.6% of the primary votes. But Taeb helped achieve something important: last month, the Virginia Democratic party announced that it would no longer accept donations from energy utilities like Dominion. The change did not come from Taeb\u2019s candidacy alone. Like Ocasio-Cortez, Taeb was one person working within a movement. For years now, activist groups like Activate Virginia have been agitating to get Dominion money out of politics. Tom Perriello made the issue central to his own 2017 primary bid for governor. Countless people working untold hours across the state helped wrest the Democratic party\u2019s priorities from its corporate donors. In another example, last year, the Florida Democratic party decided to stop accepting funding from private prison companies. Those companies, like Geo Group, which has received multiple federal prison contracts expected to reap profits of at least $664m, have donated large sums to the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), which pushes anti-immigrant legislation that makes it easier for Ice to arrest people, and fill their prisons, increasing their profits. A former executive director of the Florida Democratic party now works for the lobbying firm Ballard Partners, run by Trump\u2019s top 2016 fundraiser, whose recent clients include Geo Group, an energy company that is a major Republican donor, and the government of Turkey. That the current iteration of the Florida Democratic party finally took a strong stance against private prisons because of local party activists\u2019 demands represents a sea change. Demands for politicians to sever ties with corporations are more popular among Americans than the Democratic party had long assumed. For years, prevailing Democratic strategists believed that they could strike a balance between the competing factions of their base and also appeal to swing voters by offering candidates perceived as centrist, as if the party could offer a median political figure that everyone would like. But political science research has found that there\u2019s less of a \u201cmushy middle\u201d in American politics; rather there are lots of people for whom neither of the parties\u2019 platforms is satisfying because they simultaneously hold far-right and far-left views. One 2017 study by the Voter Study Group found that only 26.5% of the 2016 electorate held right-of-center views on economic policy. In addition, roughly two-thirds of Americans across the political spectrum say they want major political donors to have less influence. That means that progressives\u2019 rallying cries about the corrosive effects of money in politics are less divisive than received wisdom would have us believe. If Americans don\u2019t want political parties or candidates for office to be reliant on mega-donors, they need to know that just voting will not be enough. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s meteoric rise was the result of the hard work and commitment of people in the Bronx and Queens, and national strategists from groups like Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress. While national pundits will spend the next few weeks trying to decide whether \u201cthe AOC effect\u201d will be enough to catapult Sanders\u2019 presidential candidacy, organizers and volunteers across the country are using Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s example \u2013 and the example of their local candidates \u2013 as evidence that it is not naive or deluded to think that candidates can win through concentrated organizing, while advocating for policies that prioritize people over corporate donors and political machines.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019d like to understand more about whether weekend loneliness is on the rise among single people and especially in big cities where it can be harder to feel a sense of community. Single people can find themselves dealing with loneliness during the weekend as their coupled up friends desert them to spend time with their other halves and their families. During the week, when busy with work and it\u2019s often easier to meet up with friends but during the weekend, it may be much harder to find people to do things with. We would love to hear from single people who are struggling with weekend loneliness and to find out how they\u2019re dealing with it. Share your experiences We are interested in hearing in detail from single people who are busy during the week but coping with loneliness during the weekend. How does this make you feel? How does it affect you? How often do you spend weekends on your own? Do you feel abandoned by your friends at the weekend? Are you trying to use the time to make new ones? And if so, how are you doing this? Or are you accepting your weekend alone as time off to relax from a hectic week?

It would have been unjust had the same happened here, but it could have happened, as Dortmund belatedly sparked into life in the closing quarter. Still, the real concern belonged more with Dortmund, after a second successive away game in which they looked powderpuff. The defeat at Inter in the Champions League, minus Reus, had been a non-event. Had this similarly blunt performance ended in a similar result, Favre \u2013 and the club\u2019s decision makers \u2013 would have had more pressing issues to answer. Collapses in the Revierderby have done for the likes of Roberto Di Matteo and Peter Bosz before.

Zorc told Sky bluntly at full-time that \u201cwe are not discussing the coach with you\u201d, but he didn\u2019t deny that the club expect more. There is no sense that Favre\u2019s job is under immediate threat, but his team feel a bit stuck and stodgy, especially given how many creative players he has at his disposal. What also concerns is Favre\u2019s history of not responding especially well as the pressure has intensified, as the endings to his tenures at Hertha and Gladbach chronicle.</p> \n<p>That expectation will go up a notch over the coming days. In less than a fortnight Dortmund will have completed a demanding quartet of fixtures taking in a Pokal meeting with Gladbach, the visit of unbeaten Wolfsburg, the return with Inter and finally a trip to Bayern. \u201cThere\u2019s still everything to play for,\u201d emphasised Zorc. Just how much is still on the table in two weeks\u2019 time will go a long way to governing how the future unfolds.</p> \n<p>Schalke\u2019s map is less clearly defined, but they are certainly facing forwards. On Saturday \u201cit was usually Schalke who were taking a chance\u201d, wrote David Herten of Der Westen, \u201cand that\u2019s exactly what BVB should think about\u201d. Fans of both sides are likely to think of little else this week.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 What must be of equal frustration to Dortmund fans is that Bayern are hardly the well-oiled machine of previous incarnations, though they did briefly go top after beating Union Berlin. Robert Lewandowski set a new record by scoring in a ninth straight Bundesliga game from the start of the season \u2013 what was less expected was that it proved to be the winner with Union subsequently winning two penalties, scoring one and missing one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e27a73e52edb1b0d1e5e6563bd7985bb2d294320\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e27a73e52edb1b0d1e5e6563bd7985bb2d294320/0_0_3500_2266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bayern Munich\u2019s Robert Lewandowski celebrates scoring their second goal against Union Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bayern Munich\u2019s Robert Lewandowski celebrates scoring their second goal against Union Berlin.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dalder/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 Gladbach are back on top after an exciting 4-2 win over Eintracht Frankfurt, in which the visitors more than played their part.

On Saturday \u201cit was usually Schalke who were taking a chance\u201d, wrote David Herten of Der Westen, \u201cand that\u2019s exactly what BVB should think about\u201d. Fans of both sides are likely to think of little else this week. Talking points \u2022 What must be of equal frustration to Dortmund fans is that Bayern are hardly the well-oiled machine of previous incarnations, though they did briefly go top after beating Union Berlin. Robert Lewandowski set a new record by scoring in a ninth straight Bundesliga game from the start of the season \u2013 what was less expected was that it proved to be the winner with Union subsequently winning two penalties, scoring one and missing one. \u2022 Gladbach are back on top after an exciting 4-2 win over Eintracht Frankfurt, in which the visitors more than played their part. Hats off too to Freiburg, who ended a week fraught with controversy over their new stadium by grinding their way to a 2-1 win over Leipzig. \u2022 Paderborn are basking in the afterglow of their first win of the season, 2-0, over Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf. \u201cGoing 4-3-3 was they key,\u201d said Klaus Gjasula.",

      "bodyText": "A coalition led by the far-right former interior minister Matteo Salvini has swept to power in the central Italian region of Umbria, ending 50 years of leftwing rule and further shaking the resilience of the national government. Salvini has bounced back after his League party was ejected from office in August after his failed attempt to bring about snap general elections. Its former partner, the Five Star Movement (M5S), then went into coalition with the centre-left Democratic party (PD). Donatella Tesei of the League was elected president of Umbria after capturing 57% of the vote on Sunday, backed by the smaller far-right party Brothers of Italy and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia. The result means the M5S and PD alliance has stumbled in its first electoral test, with the joint candidate, Vincenzo Bianconi, who was also backed by other leftwing and green groups, taking 37% of the vote. Elections in Umbria, a hilly region with a population of about 900,000, were brought forward by a year after Catiuscia Marini of the PD was forced to resign as president in April amid an investigation into the manipulation of entrance exams for staff at a hospital in Perugia. Salvini\u2019s coalition campaigned heavily as it seized on the scandal as well as the PD\u2019s neglect of areas of the region that were affected by earthquakes in 2016. But as the trio celebrated what Salvini hailed \u201ca historical feat\u201d, the mood in the hilltop town of Orvieto was despondent on Monday morning, with voters saying they had been faced with \u201ca choice between thieves and haters\u201d.

Over a year it is estimated that this could save 5 tonnes of plastic.</p> <p>The shop will also become the first in the retailing chain in the UK to trial a reusable \u201cclick and collect\u201d bag made from 100% recycled materials.

      "bodyText": "John Lewis has stopped selling 5p single-use plastic carrier bags at its Oxford store as part of a major trial to test and change shoppers\u2019 behaviour. The sustainability initiatives, which were unveiled on Monday, are aimed at encouraging a \u201creduce, reuse and return\u201d culture among customers and could provide a model for its other shops. The pilot will test eight ways in which both the retailer and its customers can lessen their impact on the planet, including reducing plastic and excess packaging in order to prevent it from going to landfill. John Lewis\u2019s Oxford store has removed 5p plastic carrier bags from all till areas and instead encourages customers to bring a bag, or buy a reusable one. Over a year it is estimated that this could save 5 tonnes of plastic. The shop will also become the first in the retailing chain in the UK to trial a reusable \u201cclick and collect\u201d bag made from 100% recycled materials. One in four orders will be delivered to the shop in these reusable bags, meaning customers will be handed their orders without any additional packaging. Stephen Cawley, the head of sustainability at John Lewis said: \u201cOur customers have told us they want us to help them reduce their impact on the planet and that reducing and recycling packaging is key for them. Our message that we want customers to take away just the product that they love and reduce and reuse the packaging that they don\u2019t, will be clearly communicated throughout the shop.\u201d Cawley said sales of plastic carrier bags across John Lewis had fallen by 30% since the introduction of the 5p charge in England in October 2015. But the chain still sold 11.5 million bags last year. \u201cThat is an unacceptable amount of plastic\u201d he said. As concern grows about the effect of single-use plastic on the environment, manufacturers and retailers have begun to tackle their substantial carbon footprints. Last month Sainsbury\u2019s said selling milk and fizzy drinks in returnable glass bottles was an option, while Tesco will ban brands that use excessive packaging from its stores from next year. In other measures introduced at John Lewis\u2019s Oxford store, recyclable eco-wrap is being substituted for bubble wrap for china and glass products. Customers can also bring back hangers \u2013 from any retailer or brand \u2013 to be reused or recycled.

Van Outen was replaced by Kelly Brook and Liza Tarbuck prior to re-joining Vaughan for a last hurrah before the pair sailed away into the sunset in January 2001. The Big Breakfast was swiftly relaunched for a third, final, and shark-jumpingly unnecessary time, with features including Streaky Bacon, where Richard Bacon egged members of the public to come out of their house and run along their street wearing nothing but pants made out of bacon in hope of winning \u2013 that\u2019s right \u2013 some bacon. But by now, The Big Breakfast had turned from morning glory to unwanted hangover, and in March 2002, it was finally canned for good.",

      "body": "<p>In the sometimes macho world of hip-hop dance, a form that demands power and immense strength, Teneisha Bonner, who has died of breast cancer at the age of 37, proved she could do anything her male peers could, and more. Bonner was the star female performer in the choreographer Kate Prince\u2019s company, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADMpV_yUv04\" title=\"\">ZooNation</a>, and was instrumental in helping Prince take hip-hop, a once underground culture, to mainstream theatre stages and family audiences.</p> <p>She played the sassy wannabe DJ Spinderella in the company\u2019s first hit show, the exuberantly energetic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jlq48nnJpkQ\" title=\"\">Into the Hoods</a> \u2013 an urban take on Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Into the Woods \u2013 which was commissioned by Sadler\u2019s Wells and debuted at the Peacock theatre, London, in 2006 and two years later went on to become the longest running dance show in the West End. The Observer\u2019s dance critic, Luke Jennings, wrote: \u201cThe piece\u2019s star is undoubtedly Bonner, whose dramatic beauty and fluent line compel the attention whenever she\u2019s on stage.\u201d</p> <p>Bonner\u2019s dazzling vitality and precision-tooled athleticism arrested the attention of anyone watching a ZooNation show. She could be sinuously slinky or funk it up; a dancer of fierce attack or commanding grace, with a level of finesse that is rarely seen in hip-hop. Her versatility made her a favourite backing dancer for major pop acts, too, touring arenas with artists including Take That, Kylie Minogue and Rihanna.</p> <p>But more than just a brilliant technician, Bonner was a dancer of dramatic and comic flair who loved to create characters, whether a terrifying Queen of Hearts in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcBs4RxuBUw\" title=\"\">Mad Hatter\u2019s Tea Party</a> (2014), at the Linbury Studio theatre, Royal Opera House, head thrown back in dastardly laughter, or dressed in wig and moustache playing goofy comedy and heartfelt drama as Kerri in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcRtG8NL41Q\" title=\"\">Some Like it Hip Hop</a> (2011), at the Peacock theatre, a supremely entertaining spin on the gender-swap and mistaken identity stories of Some Like it Hot and Twelfth Night.</p> <p>She won a Critics\u2019 Circle National Dance award for that role (along with her co-star Tommy Franzen), the first time hip-hop dancers had won in the award\u2019s history.</p> <p>Even in fantastical characters Bonner sought to build depth into her performance and communicate with her viewers. \u201cWith all of those [fairytale] stories, you can translate them into real life,\u201d she told me in an interview. \u201cI love connecting with people, I love connecting with audiences.\u201d</p> <p>As a dancer, Bonner owned the stage, but as a person she was modest and kind, with a warm sense of mischief and an incredible work ethic. She was born in St Catherine, Jamaica, to Yvette Singh and Emanuel Bonner. When her mother moved to London to work as a nurse Teneisha was brought up by her grandmother, before joining her mother in Peck- ham, south London, aged seven.</p> <p>She became the eldest of five children, and in a busy house \u201cmy way of escape was to dance,\u201d she once said.

And while she took some local street dance classes \u2013 and used to borrow the drama-room key at secondary school so she could practise there on her own at break times \u2013 Bonner came relatively late to serious training, joining the Brit School in Croydon at 16.</p> <p>Her talent was immediately clear. She got her first professional job at 17, dancing for the pop singer Dane Bowers, appearing on Top of the Pops and CD:UK. And she was awarded a scholarship to the London Studio Centre at 18, but her training was interrupted when she successfully auditioned for the Swedish street dance company Bounce and a European tour of their hugely popular show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uurv9xnPvk\" title=\"\">Insane in the Brain</a> (an adaptation of One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest).

      "body": "<p>Colin Lowe, a football coach in Manchester, often receives calls from women in the area keen to join his new grassroots team. But when one woman called last week to ask where the team trained, he couldn\u2019t give an exact answer. \u201cI said to her: I\u2019ll ring you back next week and let you know where we\u2019re playing, because we\u2019re struggling to find places to play.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lowe\u2019s problem is one affecting grassroots women\u2019s football teams across the country. The number of girls and women <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/07/grassroots-womens-football-clubs-ready-for-world-cup-boost\">taking up the sport</a> has skyrocketed since the Women\u2019s World Cup, with 605 new girls\u2019 youth teams and 260 new women\u2019s clubs registered to play this season. But grassroots teams say the lack of affordable and accessible pitches has made it a struggle to establish themselves or grow to meet increasing demand.</p> <p>Last year, Lowe, the 49-year-old chairman and coach of Longford Park, invited mothers who were standing on the sidelines and cheering their children on to try out for a women\u2019s team. Word and enthusiasm for the new team quickly spread and Longford Park Ladies now have 40 players. While it was relatively easy to find players, finding a space for the team to train has been a nightmare.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a7c8b41af5b596961b1ad13a16b987efb915f8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a7c8b41af5b596961b1ad13a16b987efb915f8c/0_43_4152_2491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England\u2019s Ellen White scores in the World Cup semi-final against the USA\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s Ellen White scores against the USA in the 2019 World Cup semi-final.

There\u2019s no point in being there. It\u2019s daft. It\u2019s not football is it?\u201d he said.</p> <p>Naomi Short, 41, who helps coach a girls\u2019 team and set up a women\u2019s team in Trafford, said the only slot the team could train on the local pitch was between 9.15pm and 10.15pm on a weeknight because more established teams block-book pitch space for weeks at a time. \u201cI\u2019ve played football since I was five years old and there is so much more available today than there was then, but the pitches do get booked out far too quickly and we have a lot of mums on our team who can\u2019t train at odd hours,\u201d she said. Eventually, she joined Longfield Park Ladies. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7c33f2aae2e149e7c5563b0546dcae6f6ede4d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7c33f2aae2e149e7c5563b0546dcae6f6ede4d9/0_58_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Short\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Short: \u2018The pitches do get booked out far too quickly.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Goal Diggers, one of London\u2019s biggest grassroots football teams open to women and non-binary players, said they have to cap training at a local school to 60 players and spaces can go within minutes. Fleur Cousens, who founded the team four years ago, said she has been looking for bigger pitch space in Hackney and Islington for three years, but the search has become more desperate over the past few months.</p> <p>\u201cEvery night of the week there\u2019s a men\u2019s 11-a-side league that dominates those spaces and that\u2019s 22 men using it,\u201d Cousens said. \u201cI think the fact the space is only being used by men needs to change \u2026 it makes it seem those spaces are masculine.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Bruce, the chairman of AFC Stoke Newington in north London, said in general there were not enough green spaces to play football, affecting new girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 teams as well as disability teams. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem in a city like London and we need to start asking how to better distribute pieces of land that can be used to better serve the community,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Cousens accepts that while the booking systems are not trying to be discriminatory, they have to account for the fact that from 1921 to 1971, women were banned from playing on Football Association pitches and have long been widely discouraged from taking part in the sport. \u201cWe\u2019re playing catch-up on space that has been taken by men,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She called on councils to implement fundamental changes to their booking systems for pitch space, such as having one night in the week that is only open to women\u2019s groups. As for the FA, a spokesperson said it was aware of issues relating to pitch allocation and was working with the Football Foundation \u201cto deliver approximately 400 new pitches over the next three years\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the difficulties of getting on a pitch, Christina Philippou, 37, a university lecturer, said she had been taken aback by the interest in the local women\u2019s football team she set up in Guildford, Surrey. \u201cDespite the fact it\u2019s a pretty crap slot, training on a Sunday evening, it\u2019s been amazing how many people continue to turn up. I\u2019ve been really surprised by the demand, but there seems to be a gap in the market there,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Nicky Ellison, an adult careers adviser, said the lack of pitch space meant she had an uphill battle in developing women\u2019s football in Bournemouth, Dorset. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to start my own five-a-side league, but before we even get to that point, just training on a normal pitch is impossible,\u201d she said. The team she set up plays at the local YMCA and though the facilities are not big enough, it is all they can afford.</p> <p>Ellison is determined to set up an accessible and affordable league despite the challenges, saying that she has seen women transform through playing with the team. \u201cI think sometimes women focus on their families and other supporting other people, and they don\u2019t do something for themselves, and I think we can do more to encourage that in this country,\u201d she said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Colin Lowe, a football coach in Manchester, often receives calls from women in the area keen to join his new grassroots team. But when one woman called last week to ask where the team trained, he couldn\u2019t give an exact answer. \u201cI said to her: I\u2019ll ring you back next week and let you know where we\u2019re playing, because we\u2019re struggling to find places to play.\u2019\u201d Lowe\u2019s problem is one affecting grassroots women\u2019s football teams across the country. The number of girls and women taking up the sport has skyrocketed since the Women\u2019s World Cup, with 605 new girls\u2019 youth teams and 260 new women\u2019s clubs registered to play this season. But grassroots teams say the lack of affordable and accessible pitches has made it a struggle to establish themselves or grow to meet increasing demand. Last year, Lowe, the 49-year-old chairman and coach of Longford Park, invited mothers who were standing on the sidelines and cheering their children on to try out for a women\u2019s team. Word and enthusiasm for the new team quickly spread and Longford Park Ladies now have 40 players. While it was relatively easy to find players, finding a space for the team to train has been a nightmare. \u201cWe\u2019ve got nowhere at the moment, we\u2019re struggling,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky one because the men have been established now for so many years, but all of a sudden in the last four years there\u2019s huge growth [in women\u2019s football].\u201d The local affordable pitches are all booked up, he explained, forcing women to chose between travelling far or paying more than \u00a3100 an hour to use private 4G astroturf pitches. Lowe said teams such as his have to settle for playing on hockey pitches for matches and training, much to his dismay. \u201cThere\u2019s no control with the football \u2026 And when it rains, you haven\u2019t got a chance. There\u2019s no point in being there. It\u2019s daft. It\u2019s not football is it?\u201d he said. Naomi Short, 41, who helps coach a girls\u2019 team and set up a women\u2019s team in Trafford, said the only slot the team could train on the local pitch was between 9.15pm and 10.15pm on a weeknight because more established teams block-book pitch space for weeks at a time. \u201cI\u2019ve played football since I was five years old and there is so much more available today than there was then, but the pitches do get booked out far too quickly and we have a lot of mums on our team who can\u2019t train at odd hours,\u201d she said. Eventually, she joined Longfield Park Ladies. Goal Diggers, one of London\u2019s biggest grassroots football teams open to women and non-binary players, said they have to cap training at a local school to 60 players and spaces can go within minutes. Fleur Cousens, who founded the team four years ago, said she has been looking for bigger pitch space in Hackney and Islington for three years, but the search has become more desperate over the past few months. \u201cEvery night of the week there\u2019s a men\u2019s 11-a-side league that dominates those spaces and that\u2019s 22 men using it,\u201d Cousens said. \u201cI think the fact the space is only being used by men needs to change \u2026 it makes it seem those spaces are masculine.\u201d Ian Bruce, the chairman of AFC Stoke Newington in north London, said in general there were not enough green spaces to play football, affecting new girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 teams as well as disability teams. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem in a city like London and we need to start asking how to better distribute pieces of land that can be used to better serve the community,\u201d he said. Cousens accepts that while the booking systems are not trying to be discriminatory, they have to account for the fact that from 1921 to 1971, women were banned from playing on Football Association pitches and have long been widely discouraged from taking part in the sport. \u201cWe\u2019re playing catch-up on space that has been taken by men,\u201d she said. She called on councils to implement fundamental changes to their booking systems for pitch space, such as having one night in the week that is only open to women\u2019s groups. As for the FA, a spokesperson said it was aware of issues relating to pitch allocation and was working with the Football Foundation \u201cto deliver approximately 400 new pitches over the next three years\u201d. Despite the difficulties of getting on a pitch, Christina Philippou, 37, a university lecturer, said she had been taken aback by the interest in the local women\u2019s football team she set up in Guildford, Surrey. \u201cDespite the fact it\u2019s a pretty crap slot, training on a Sunday evening, it\u2019s been amazing how many people continue to turn up. I\u2019ve been really surprised by the demand, but there seems to be a gap in the market there,\u201d she said. Nicky Ellison, an adult careers adviser, said the lack of pitch space meant she had an uphill battle in developing women\u2019s football in Bournemouth, Dorset. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to start my own five-a-side league, but before we even get to that point, just training on a normal pitch is impossible,\u201d she said. The team she set up plays at the local YMCA and though the facilities are not big enough, it is all they can afford. Ellison is determined to set up an accessible and affordable league despite the challenges, saying that she has seen women transform through playing with the team. \u201cI think sometimes women focus on their families and other supporting other people, and they don\u2019t do something for themselves, and I think we can do more to encourage that in this country,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest retailers have been ramping up their stockpiling efforts to record levels in the run-up to Brexit, according to the Confederation of British Industry. The country\u2019s leading business lobby group said retailers\u2019 stock levels compared with the volume of expected sales had risen to the highest point in October since it began compiling retail sales estimates in 1983. The CBI said the spike came as retailers built up their stocks before the Christmas shopping period and as fears lingered over a no-deal Brexit in advance of the EU granting an extension until 31 January. It said retailers had stocked more seasonal products earlier than usual amid concerns that a disruptive withdrawal from the EU could have delayed delivery of European goods. Some major firms have stockpiled beer, wine and spirits to keep the alcohol flowing at Christmas, including champagne. Against a backdrop of heightened Brexit uncertainty, retailers had been concerned that the 31 October deadline would clash with the buildup to the busiest shopping period of the year, when warehouse space and seasonal labour is already in high demand without the added complication of any potential border disruption. Rain Newton-Smith, the chief economist at the CBI, said: \u201cThe timing could not be worse: the run-up to Christmas is a crucial time of year for the retail sector and not knowing where we will be on 1 November is adding more strain to an already beleaguered sector.\u201d The analysis of the CBI survey of 82 firms, which included 41 retailers, as well as motor traders and wholesale distributors, showed sales declined for a sixth consecutive month in October \u2013 the longest period for sliding sales since the financial crisis. Sales volumes in the year to October dropped by 10% from the same period a year ago, while retailers said they expected sales volumes to be broadly flat \u2013 with a rise of about 1% forecast for November. In a reflection of the challenges facing high street retailers, the CBI said online sales growth increased in the year to October, with the volume of goods sold up 49% compared with the same period a year ago. Some economists said the CBI figures were much gloomier than the official measurement of retail sales from the Office for National Statistics, which in recent months has painted a more resilient picture of consumer spending. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the survey had a small sample size and a bias towards traditional high street retailers, which had been hit hard amid the shift to online shopping.",

His chapbook, <a href=\"https://poetrybusiness.co.uk/product/complicity/]\">Complicity</a>, was the Poetry Book Society\u2019s winter choice in the same year.</p> <p>Now the increasingly watchable Nine Arches press has brought out Sastry\u2019s first full collection, <a href=\"http://ninearchespress.com/publications/poetry-collections/a%252520man%27s%252520house%252520catches%252520fire.html\">A Man\u2019s House Catches Fire</a>. The subtitles of its three sections suggest the preoccupations: Misenchantments, the Unheroic and When the light reminds you to look. Sastry knows that \u201ccatastrophe lives at the end of the street\u201d, but his presiding muse, watchful and wry, is comedic. Born in 1974, \u201ca second generation Original\u201d as he declares, who has \u201cspent most of his life in bedrooms, classrooms and offices\u201d, Sastry is one of the new, resonant but low-key male voices in the poetry choir, carrying quirked, millennial echoes of a \u201cless deceived\u201d and less-anguished Philip Larkin.</p> <p>Sastry is a spoken word poet as well as writing speak-it-silently-in-your-head work. He distinguishes between the two markets \u2013 at least, his press release tells us that a collection of performance poems will be published by <a href=\"https://burningeye.bigcartel.com/\">Burning Eye Books</a> in 2020. But one of the particular pleasures of A Man\u2019s House Catches Fire is that Sastry doesn\u2019t come across as a talent divided. For all the structural craft of these poems, there\u2019s often more than a trace element of standup in the voice. It\u2019s an engaging aspect of the poems, including this week\u2019s choice.</p> <p>In Hanging out with musicians, still in my suit, Sastry could have been talkin\u2019 \u2019bout my generation, and all the anxieties of 1960s hip-fluence that accompanied our provincial rebellions and sulky submissions to conventional life. I smiled when I read it, and every time I reread it, my sympathy with the speaker gradually acquiring a little extra crinkle of understanding.</p> <p>Sastry\u2019s characterisation is perfect.

      "bodyText": "Hanging out with musicians, still in my suit He said fucking and that was important: \u201cWe\u2019re all fucking broken.\u201d He said it gently like a priest, soothing the smart of sin. I hadn\u2019t heard about it before this shared brokenness and it was new to me, this idea that being in pieces could bring us together so my mind worked through all the things he might mean and like the fourteen-stone word-association machine that I am I remembered all the world\u2019s once-complete, now-shattered things until I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head that we were broken like jigsaws fucking broken like fucking jigsaws and it felt right and wise and true. Tom Sastry was among the poets chosen in 2016 by Carol Ann Duffy for her series of pamphlets published under the rubric Laureate\u2019s Choice. His chapbook, Complicity, was the Poetry Book Society\u2019s winter choice in the same year. Now the increasingly watchable Nine Arches press has brought out Sastry\u2019s first full collection, A Man\u2019s House Catches Fire. The subtitles of its three sections suggest the preoccupations: Misenchantments, the Unheroic and When the light reminds you to look. Sastry knows that \u201ccatastrophe lives at the end of the street\u201d, but his presiding muse, watchful and wry, is comedic. Born in 1974, \u201ca second generation Original\u201d as he declares, who has \u201cspent most of his life in bedrooms, classrooms and offices\u201d, Sastry is one of the new, resonant but low-key male voices in the poetry choir, carrying quirked, millennial echoes of a \u201cless deceived\u201d and less-anguished Philip Larkin. Sastry is a spoken word poet as well as writing speak-it-silently-in-your-head work. He distinguishes between the two markets \u2013 at least, his press release tells us that a collection of performance poems will be published by Burning Eye Books in 2020. But one of the particular pleasures of A Man\u2019s House Catches Fire is that Sastry doesn\u2019t come across as a talent divided. For all the structural craft of these poems, there\u2019s often more than a trace element of standup in the voice. It\u2019s an engaging aspect of the poems, including this week\u2019s choice. In Hanging out with musicians, still in my suit, Sastry could have been talkin\u2019 \u2019bout my generation, and all the anxieties of 1960s hip-fluence that accompanied our provincial rebellions and sulky submissions to conventional life. I smiled when I read it, and every time I reread it, my sympathy with the speaker gradually acquiring a little extra crinkle of understanding. Sastry\u2019s characterisation is perfect. The narrator, a young man in a suit, having his big rebellious moment down among the rockers, is potentially easy satirical prey. To make him sympathetic as well as silly is the challenge. Sastry meets it, catching the idiomatic authenticity of the voice, avoiding exaggeration, allowing the character an inner life. To some extent, the man knows his limitations. His self-denigration begins with the title. He\u2019s a \u201csquare\u201d speaker wryly admitting to aspirations to be hip in action and language: \u201changing out\u201d would be a phrase he relishes. The musician conforms to a slightly simpler stereotype. In the little he says, the diction is recognisably \u201cbeat\u201d. It\u2019s important for the characterisation that he says \u201cfucking\u201d without noticing, not intending to impress his visitor. He may be stoned, he may be speaking out of some visionary higher consciousness. His words (\u201cWe\u2019re all fucking broken\u201d) sound end-of-party-ish, quasi-profound, but Sastry\u2019s persona responds to the suggestion of spirituality. The musician speaks \u201cgently\u201d and almost absolvingly. Sastry could have had him say \u201cWe\u2019re all fucking broken, man\u201d \u2013 in which case, he\u2019d have been declared a phoney. Once again, Sastry doesn\u2019t take his mockery so far. He allows both characters their authenticity, and thus finds their connection. Punctuation (minimal after the first verse) and lineation reinforce the impression of the poem as dramatic script, plotting in timely emphases and the kind of beat that is silent. The single-word line \u201cand\u201d slows the pace nicely: we can hear the ticking of the speaker\u2019s brain, the pedantry of his contemplation of \u201call the world\u2019s once-complete, now-shattered things\u201d. The poem\u2019s climax settles around that word \u201cjigsaw\u201d, arousing amusement and pity combined. It\u2019s the best the suit-wearer can do for an image of brokenness, and it\u2019s a feeble one. Jigsaws hardly evoke shattering or ruin: they are specially made to be broken and reassembled.

      "bodyText": "Women are paid just \u00a3380,000 on average over their lifetimes compared with \u00a3643,000 for men, according to official figures that lay bare the scale of Britain\u2019s gender pay gap. The figures in the Office for National Statistics\u2019 Human Capital Estimates report revealed huge inequality between men and women even at the highest levels of educational attainment. It said women with a master\u2019s or PhD degree still made one-third less over their lifetimes than men with the same qualifications. \u201cWomen aged 26 to 35 years with higher degrees have average lifetime earnings of \u00a3803,000, whereas men of the same age with undergraduate level qualifications have average lifetime earnings of around \u00a31,160,000,\u201d the ONS said on Monday. It said there had been a small improvement over the last 15 years: \u201cThe gap in average lifetime earnings for men and women has narrowed, with women now receiving, on average, 59% of men\u2019s average lifetime earnings; this is up from 56% in 2004.\u201d The findings are contained in an ambitious attempt by the ONS to assess Britain\u2019s entire \u201chuman capital\u201d in financial terms. It said that even after adjusting for hours worked, women were paid about a fifth less than men over their lifetimes. \u201cTaking account the effect of weekly hours worked for men and women, women\u2019s human capital is 22.7% lower than men\u2019s,\u201d it found. Men and women tend to have the same pay in their late teens and early 20s, but after that their incomes diverge markedly. When the ONS looked at those aged 16 to 65 whose highest educational level was A-levels or equivalent, the gap peaked at the age of 48. At this point, the average male is paid \u00a316,600 more than the average female. The ONS said the figures reflected differences in working patterns, with women\u2019s lifetime earnings lower as many more worked part-time. In separate analysis this year, the ONS said the gender pay gap for 18- to 39-year-olds who worked full time had fallen to \u201cclose to zero\u201d. \u201cFrom the age of 40 years, it widens. For all employees, the gender pay gap widens after the age of 30 years and this coincides with an increase in working part-time from this age. A negative gender pay gap among part-time employees emerges in the age group 30 to 39 years before reversing by the age of 50 years.\u201d The ONS said gender pay gap figures did not show differences in rates of pay for comparable jobs, as they were affected by factors such as the proportion of men and women working part-time or in different occupations. \u201cFor example, a higher proportion of women work in occupations such as administration and caring, which tend to offer lower salaries,\u201d it said. The figures come as one of the BBC\u2019s most prominent female presenters, Samira Ahmed, is taking the broadcaster to an employment tribunal over claims she was paid less than male colleagues for doing equivalent work, in a landmark case against the corporation. Gemma Rosenblatt of the Fawcett Society, one of the most vigorous campaign groups on the gender pay gap, said: \u201cThe cumulative impact of the gender pay gap leaves women with a significantly lower lifetime income and pension pot than men \u2013 this simply isn\u2019t fair. \u201cMore needs to be done to tackle the gender pay gap and its causes. Gender pay gap reporting is helpful but it needs to go further. It\u2019s time for action not excuses.

      "body": "<p>Today, Labour MPs will decide whether the country will head to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50199689\" title=\"\">polls in December</a>. Many are hostile towards the idea, fearing that they are facing an electoral wipeout. Instead, they cling to the prospect of securing a second referendum as an alternative means to stopping Brexit. With the <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/tories-surge-to-16-point-lead-over-labour-poll-11846200\" title=\"\">polls where they are</a>, it is understandable that Labour MPs are fearful of facing the electorate.</p> <p>But this election could be far closer than is commonly imagined. The ascendancy of the SNP in Scotland, the rise of the Liberal Democrats in England, and the schism between the Tories and the DUP means that there are fewer seats in play for the major parties. Labour and the Conservatives must compete for around 540 seats; with no viable coalition partners, the Tories must secure 322 seats for a majority of one. For that to occur, Labour must get no more than 218 seats \u2013 far below either its performance in either 2015 or 2017 (232 and 262 seats respectively). Conversely, if Labour can defend its current seats, it would enable an anti-Tory majority to be formed.</p> <p>Strategically, Labour approaches a general election with three major advantages.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/25/boris-johnson-conservatives-nhs-funding\">These brutal cuts to the NHS will haunt the Conservatives | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first is that the deal Johnson has negotiated is truly awful for the country, leaving Britain substantially poorer according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/28/uk-significantly-worse-off-under-all-brexit-scenarios-official-forecast-gdp\" title=\"\">government\u2019s own figures</a>. The second is that the Tories have the record of their 10 years in power to defend \u2013 a decade during which public services and benefits have been cut, wages have stagnated and living standards have been squeezed \u2013 alongside Brexit chaos: a winter election highlights these issues, from the rise in concern about homelessness during the Christmas period to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/25/hospitals-still-in-grip-of-winter-crisis-nhs-england-figures-show\" title=\"\">likely winter crisis in the NHS</a> as a result of systematic underfunding. Third, polling shows that Johnson is <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/explore/public_figure/Boris_Johnson\" title=\"\">disliked by large parts of the electorate</a>, and many people might be <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/08/30/polls-dont-look-good-labour-there-still-path-elect\" title=\"\">prepared to vote tactically</a> to keep the party they dislike out of office. This opens up the route to at least some informal electoral pact between the anti-Tory parties \u2013 perhaps a loose agreement not to campaign in certain seats.</p> <p>Absent a settled strategy, Labour languishes behind in the polls. Its MPs focus their interventions on questions of parliamentary process and election timing rather than critiquing Johnson\u2019s plans or articulating Labour\u2019s policies. When politicians talk about their own priorities, not those of the voters, it should be little surprise that they are not rewarded by the electorate. This can and must change. So what would a more effective strategy look like?</p> <p>The public need to want to fire the Tories before deciding that they wish to hire Labour. It would be a serious error to think that Brexit can be ignored by simply talking about other issues. At the time of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/jun/08/live-uk-election-results-in-full-2017\" title=\"\">the 2017 poll</a>, the chaos and perpetual crisis of the following two-and-a-half years was unimaginable. The mistake that Theresa May made was to call a general election after article 50 notification had taken place; this meant most voters thought that Brexit had been sorted and that it was only a matter of time before Britain would leave the EU. No one thinks that now. Brexit will be front and centre in this election no matter how much some might wish it away.</p> <p>In any election, the public either want change or more of the same. In 2017, the Tory message of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/10/strong-and-stable-leadership-could-theresa-mays-rhetorical-carpet-bombing-backfire\" title=\"\">strong and stable leadership</a>\u201d sounded like an appeal for continuity and so in what became a change election, they paid the price. Labour needs to present this campaign as a choice between more of the same with the Tories or a new start with Labour.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the first phase of the Labour campaign should be to demonstrate how each strand of Johnson\u2019s deal represents continuity with a decade of Tory austerity and misrule, heaping disaster on dismay. After 10 years of NHS cuts, the Tories now want to <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-selling-nhs-leaving-20738970\" title=\"\">sell</a><a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-selling-nhs-leaving-20738970\" title=\"\"> off the NHS to </a><a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-selling-nhs-leaving-20738970\" title=\"\">private corporations</a>. After a decade without a real pay rise, the Tories plan is to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50199309\" title=\"\">strip away workers\u2019 rights</a> for a deal with Trump\u2019s America where there\u2019s no maternity pay, no sick pay, 10 days\u2019 holiday and the ability for bosses to fire people on the spot for no reason. After a decade of putting the bankers first, their sell-out deal will mean the end of decent manufacturing jobs as the price of avoiding banking regulations. A vote for Johnson is a vote for more of the same. And to make matters worse, Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan still includes a trapdoor to a no-deal disaster. The only way to stop a prime minister committed to a no-deal exit from the EU is to fight and win a general election that removes him from office.</p> <p>Next, Labour has to make, and win, the argument for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/09/labour-second-referendum-jeremy-corbyn-brexit\" title=\"\">second referendum</a>. Its message \u2013 \u201clet the people decide\u201d \u2013 has failed to cut through precisely because its strongest remain voices on the backbenches have focused more on timing and tactics than on bothering to prosecute the argument. More than that, the message sounds like one of exasperation: that Labour is incapable of making its own mind up, so it has outsourced the responsibility to the public. Instead, Labour needs to make a deeper argument about the kind of country we want to be: this could be extended beyond Brexit into an agenda for economic democracy and more public participation in decision-making.</p> <p>Labour also needs to offer the country an alternative project of national renewal. With a plan to settle Brexit for good, Labour should then offer to rebuild Britain instead. It can frame this as a 1945 moment: the chance to shape a new settlement for the decades ahead. That means a manifesto bursting with good ideas to improve the state of country and fundamental reform of the status quo. But it also needs to show how change can be meaningful: that will require translating big, bold, national policy commitments into what they could mean for every part of Britain. From the national transformation fund to the green industrial revolution, Labour has been willing to think big about the future of the country: it now has an urgent task to think small about what it might mean for each community and every household.</p> <p>Finally, Labour should ignore the idea of extending the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/22/voter-id-laws-liberals-voting-rights\" title=\"\">franchise to 16-year-olds</a>, which will be viewed as the naked pursuit of self-interest. It should instead argue that every voter must be offered a postal vote, given the hours of daylight and the potential for bad weather on polling day. All the evidence shows that electoral fraud is virtually non-existent and that postal voting increases participation, especially from those groups in society that are marginalised or vulnerable. Let the Tories explain why they want to inconvenience people during the cold winter months.</p> <p>There can be no doubt that Labour has an electoral mountain to climb. But there are reasons to believe that it can do so in this election of generational significance. The country cannot afford and should not expect anything less.</p> <p>\u2022 Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics. He is writing in a personal capacity</p>",

      "bodyText": "Today, Labour MPs will decide whether the country will head to the polls in December. Many are hostile towards the idea, fearing that they are facing an electoral wipeout. Instead, they cling to the prospect of securing a second referendum as an alternative means to stopping Brexit. With the polls where they are, it is understandable that Labour MPs are fearful of facing the electorate. But this election could be far closer than is commonly imagined. The ascendancy of the SNP in Scotland, the rise of the Liberal Democrats in England, and the schism between the Tories and the DUP means that there are fewer seats in play for the major parties. Labour and the Conservatives must compete for around 540 seats; with no viable coalition partners, the Tories must secure 322 seats for a majority of one. For that to occur, Labour must get no more than 218 seats \u2013 far below either its performance in either 2015 or 2017 (232 and 262 seats respectively). Conversely, if Labour can defend its current seats, it would enable an anti-Tory majority to be formed. Strategically, Labour approaches a general election with three major advantages. The first is that the deal Johnson has negotiated is truly awful for the country, leaving Britain substantially poorer according to the government\u2019s own figures. The second is that the Tories have the record of their 10 years in power to defend \u2013 a decade during which public services and benefits have been cut, wages have stagnated and living standards have been squeezed \u2013 alongside Brexit chaos: a winter election highlights these issues, from the rise in concern about homelessness during the Christmas period to the likely winter crisis in the NHS as a result of systematic underfunding. Third, polling shows that Johnson is disliked by large parts of the electorate, and many people might be prepared to vote tactically to keep the party they dislike out of office. This opens up the route to at least some informal electoral pact between the anti-Tory parties \u2013 perhaps a loose agreement not to campaign in certain seats. Absent a settled strategy, Labour languishes behind in the polls. Its MPs focus their interventions on questions of parliamentary process and election timing rather than critiquing Johnson\u2019s plans or articulating Labour\u2019s policies. When politicians talk about their own priorities, not those of the voters, it should be little surprise that they are not rewarded by the electorate. This can and must change. So what would a more effective strategy look like? The public need to want to fire the Tories before deciding that they wish to hire Labour. It would be a serious error to think that Brexit can be ignored by simply talking about other issues. At the time of the 2017 poll, the chaos and perpetual crisis of the following two-and-a-half years was unimaginable. The mistake that Theresa May made was to call a general election after article 50 notification had taken place; this meant most voters thought that Brexit had been sorted and that it was only a matter of time before Britain would leave the EU. No one thinks that now. Brexit will be front and centre in this election no matter how much some might wish it away. In any election, the public either want change or more of the same. In 2017, the Tory message of \u201cstrong and stable leadership\u201d sounded like an appeal for continuity and so in what became a change election, they paid the price. Labour needs to present this campaign as a choice between more of the same with the Tories or a new start with Labour. That\u2019s why the first phase of the Labour campaign should be to demonstrate how each strand of Johnson\u2019s deal represents continuity with a decade of Tory austerity and misrule, heaping disaster on dismay. After 10 years of NHS cuts, the Tories now want to sell off the NHS to private corporations. After a decade without a real pay rise, the Tories plan is to strip away workers\u2019 rights for a deal with Trump\u2019s America where there\u2019s no maternity pay, no sick pay, 10 days\u2019 holiday and the ability for bosses to fire people on the spot for no reason. After a decade of putting the bankers first, their sell-out deal will mean the end of decent manufacturing jobs as the price of avoiding banking regulations. A vote for Johnson is a vote for more of the same. And to make matters worse, Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan still includes a trapdoor to a no-deal disaster. The only way to stop a prime minister committed to a no-deal exit from the EU is to fight and win a general election that removes him from office. Next, Labour has to make, and win, the argument for a second referendum. Its message \u2013 \u201clet the people decide\u201d \u2013 has failed to cut through precisely because its strongest remain voices on the backbenches have focused more on timing and tactics than on bothering to prosecute the argument. More than that, the message sounds like one of exasperation: that Labour is incapable of making its own mind up, so it has outsourced the responsibility to the public. Instead, Labour needs to make a deeper argument about the kind of country we want to be: this could be extended beyond Brexit into an agenda for economic democracy and more public participation in decision-making. Labour also needs to offer the country an alternative project of national renewal. With a plan to settle Brexit for good, Labour should then offer to rebuild Britain instead. It can frame this as a 1945 moment: the chance to shape a new settlement for the decades ahead. That means a manifesto bursting with good ideas to improve the state of country and fundamental reform of the status quo. But it also needs to show how change can be meaningful: that will require translating big, bold, national policy commitments into what they could mean for every part of Britain. From the national transformation fund to the green industrial revolution, Labour has been willing to think big about the future of the country: it now has an urgent task to think small about what it might mean for each community and every household. Finally, Labour should ignore the idea of extending the franchise to 16-year-olds, which will be viewed as the naked pursuit of self-interest. It should instead argue that every voter must be offered a postal vote, given the hours of daylight and the potential for bad weather on polling day. All the evidence shows that electoral fraud is virtually non-existent and that postal voting increases participation, especially from those groups in society that are marginalised or vulnerable. Let the Tories explain why they want to inconvenience people during the cold winter months. There can be no doubt that Labour has an electoral mountain to climb. But there are reasons to believe that it can do so in this election of generational significance. The country cannot afford and should not expect anything less. \u2022 Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics. He is writing in a personal capacity",

      "body": "<p>Studies tell us school bullies have often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/29/bullying.schools\">been victims of bullying themselves</a>. Watching Atalanta humiliate Udinese on Sunday afternoon, it was tempting to wonder whether something similar might apply to football teams.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/22/manchester-city-atalanta-champions-league-match-report\">Beaten 5-1 by Manchester City</a> in midweek, the Bergamo club returned home to thrash their next opponent 7-1. They even allowed Udinese the illusory joy of scoring the first goal, just as they had experienced at the Etihad.</p> \n<p>It was an astonishing result. Udinese arrived boasting the stingiest defence in all of Serie A, having conceded just six times in their previous eight games. A first-half red card to the defender Nicholas Opoku contributed, but Atalanta dazzled with the relentless tempo and directness of their attacks. Gian Piero Gasperini ended the day fending off journalists\u2019 questions about whether his team could challenge for the title. They sit just three points off first place, after Juventus, Internazionale and Napoli drew, and have outscored every team except City (who have played a game more) across Europe\u2019s top five leagues.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1188474319317471232\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u26bd It's a second for Luis Muriel, and Atalanta are running riot against Udinese!<br><br>4\u20e3-1\u20e3 to Gasperini's men <a href=\"https://t.co/mnEE9k1VYV\">pic.twitter.com/mnEE9k1VYV</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1188474319317471232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 27, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>This weekend, however, Gasperini had to share the limelight with his own coaching protege. Thiago Motta could not coax seven goals out of Genoa in his first game. But he did achieve something no other Serie A manager had ever done before: sending on three substitutes, who all went on to score.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1188394075273207813\">Trailing 1-0 at home to Brescia</a>, Motta introduced Kevin Agudelo at half-time, Goran Pandev after 58 minutes and then Christian Kouam\u00e9 in the 65th. The last of those players hit the crossbar within seconds of entering the pitch. The first of them equalised a few moments after that.</p> \n<p>Signed from the Colombian club Atletico Huila in the summer, Agudelo had never made an appearance under Genoa\u2019s previous manager, Aurelio Andreazzoli. Motta\u2019s decision to offer him a debut here was justified as the player swept home a confident finish from Andrea Pinamonti\u2019s cut-back inside the box. Kouam\u00e9 scored next, meeting Paolo Ghiglione\u2019s cross with a spectacular scissor-kick. Their final goal came on the counter, Pandev exploiting the space left by an exhausted and overstretched Brescia team as he cut across Ales Mateju to bury a shot into the far corner.</p> \n<p>This was a hugely important win for Genoa, who had begun the weekend second from bottom. They had taken just a single point from their final six games under Andreazzoli, and conceded 19 goals in eight matches overall. The mood at their Marassi stadium has been mutinous. Ultras left the northern stand empty for the first 10 minutes on Saturday, and a banner hung in that section warned that they could stay away for a whole season in future if nothing improved.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85c1c1b21de5374ac4135f3fef5b3507cbc1cad4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85c1c1b21de5374ac4135f3fef5b3507cbc1cad4/0_75_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Kouam\u00e9 was one of three Genoa substitutes to come off the bench and score in the 3-1 victory over Brescia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Kouam\u00e9 was one of three Genoa substitutes to come off the bench and score in the 3-1 victory over Brescia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simone Arveda/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Even the appointment of Motta had been divisive. Although popular during his time at Genoa as a player, his only coaching experience was a single season in charge of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Under-19s. He had been ridiculed in the Italian press last year for supposedly suggesting that his team\u2019s formation could be described as a 2-7-2, with the goalkeeper joining midfield.</p> \n<p>In reality, Motta\u2019s words had been grossly misinterpreted. Asked which formation he preferred during an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport, he sought to make the point that the numbers do not really matter \u2013 since modern football is a fluid game in which a team must constantly readjust its shape.</p> \n<p>To reinforce his point that formations themselves were abstract, Motta proposed that you could read a 4-3-3 formation as a 2-7-2 if you read it from left to right (ie: two players in the wide left zone, seven in the middle, two in the right) instead of going from back to front. None of which stopped the papers from comparing him to Oronzo Can\u00e0, the central character from cult 1980s football coaching parody L\u2019Allenatore nel Pallone, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5jJMgK1-88\">proposed that his team line up in a 5-5-5</a>.</p> \n<p>Whether Motta is ready to manage at this level, only time will tell. Although his substitutions worked out gloriously against Brescia, it is also true his initial team selection had flaws \u2013 with Ivan Radovanovic looking lost after being drawn back from his usual spot in midfield to play at centre-back, and Pinamonti underwhelming as a lone centre-forward. Genoa had almost 65% possession in the first half, but took a total of just four shots.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5991609357f2e4f64a2648e2aa247e4f5cd57c2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5991609357f2e4f64a2648e2aa247e4f5cd57c2/684_56_2388_1433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thiago Motta marked his debut in the Genoa dugout with the club\u2019s first win in almost two months.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thiago Motta marked his debut in the Genoa dugout with the club\u2019s first win in almost two months.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simone Arveda/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Motta is not even fully qualified, and must continue to take courses at Coverciano in order to obtain his Uefa Pro licence. On the other hand, that may matter less in the long run than the insights he gained from working under the likes of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at Inter and Carlo Ancelotti in Paris.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He won a treble with the former, as did Pandev. Asked about the experience of coaching a former teammate, Motta noted that the Macedonian has had no problem calling him \u201cMister\u201d \u2013 the Italian equivalent to \u201cBoss\u201d.</p> \n<p>It is Gasperini, though, that Motta cites as the greatest influence on his coaching ideas. \u201cI learned so much from him,\u201d he said after taking the Genoa job. \u201cIt is an honour to be in charge of the team where he used to manage me.\u201d He would do well to follow in the footsteps of Gasperini, whose seven-and-a-half years in charge of Genoa \u2013 split across two stints \u2013 represent the most successful periods of the club\u2019s recent history. No other manager has even made it through a complete season in charge of the club since it returned to Serie A in 2007.</p> \n<p>For now, it would be enough for Motta simply to steer Genoa away from the relegation zone. To take a team that has often been bullied this season, and teach it how to fight back.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 No new manager bounce, then, for Stefano Pioli at Milan. After drawing his first game, against Lecce, the <em>Rossoneri</em> followed up with a defeat to Roma, courtesy of two goals that felt so avoidable. Franck Kessi\u00e9 left Edin Dzeko unmarked at the back post for the opening goal, before Davide Calabria simply passed the ball straight to the striker \u2013 who moved it on, via a deflection, to Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo \u2013 for the winner.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Ciro Immobile\u2019s 89th-minute winner at Fiorentina was his 10th goal of this league season. Only three players have ever hit double figures after nine games before, and one of those was Immobile himself \u2013 in 2017-18. That said, it\u2019s a mystery how this one was allowed to stand after the move began with what looked like an obvious foul by Jordan Lukaku on Riccardo Sottil.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Interesting to note the different reactions of the front-runners\u2019 managers to their respective draws. Carlo Ancelotti, as usual, sought to minimise the implications of a single result, saying he was happy with Napoli\u2019s performance. Maurizio Sarri mostly had to field questions about his decision to rest a tired Ronaldo, but acknowledged some flaws in Juventus\u2019s display, from a lack of ruthlessness up front to a passivity when in the lead. Antonio Conte, meanwhile, seemed to call for new signings, when he highlighted recent injuries and asserted his Inter squad did not have enough depth to cope with so many games in quick succession.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"94c294f9-d047-480f-ab09-0cafe279f161\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n

      "bodyText": "Studies tell us school bullies have often been victims of bullying themselves. Watching Atalanta humiliate Udinese on Sunday afternoon, it was tempting to wonder whether something similar might apply to football teams. Beaten 5-1 by Manchester City in midweek, the Bergamo club returned home to thrash their next opponent 7-1. They even allowed Udinese the illusory joy of scoring the first goal, just as they had experienced at the Etihad. It was an astonishing result. Udinese arrived boasting the stingiest defence in all of Serie A, having conceded just six times in their previous eight games. A first-half red card to the defender Nicholas Opoku contributed, but Atalanta dazzled with the relentless tempo and directness of their attacks. Gian Piero Gasperini ended the day fending off journalists\u2019 questions about whether his team could challenge for the title. They sit just three points off first place, after Juventus, Internazionale and Napoli drew, and have outscored every team except City (who have played a game more) across Europe\u2019s top five leagues. This weekend, however, Gasperini had to share the limelight with his own coaching protege. Thiago Motta could not coax seven goals out of Genoa in his first game. But he did achieve something no other Serie A manager had ever done before: sending on three substitutes, who all went on to score. Trailing 1-0 at home to Brescia, Motta introduced Kevin Agudelo at half-time, Goran Pandev after 58 minutes and then Christian Kouam\u00e9 in the 65th. The last of those players hit the crossbar within seconds of entering the pitch. The first of them equalised a few moments after that. Signed from the Colombian club Atletico Huila in the summer, Agudelo had never made an appearance under Genoa\u2019s previous manager, Aurelio Andreazzoli. Motta\u2019s decision to offer him a debut here was justified as the player swept home a confident finish from Andrea Pinamonti\u2019s cut-back inside the box. Kouam\u00e9 scored next, meeting Paolo Ghiglione\u2019s cross with a spectacular scissor-kick. Their final goal came on the counter, Pandev exploiting the space left by an exhausted and overstretched Brescia team as he cut across Ales Mateju to bury a shot into the far corner. This was a hugely important win for Genoa, who had begun the weekend second from bottom. They had taken just a single point from their final six games under Andreazzoli, and conceded 19 goals in eight matches overall. The mood at their Marassi stadium has been mutinous. Ultras left the northern stand empty for the first 10 minutes on Saturday, and a banner hung in that section warned that they could stay away for a whole season in future if nothing improved. Even the appointment of Motta had been divisive. Although popular during his time at Genoa as a player, his only coaching experience was a single season in charge of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Under-19s. He had been ridiculed in the Italian press last year for supposedly suggesting that his team\u2019s formation could be described as a 2-7-2, with the goalkeeper joining midfield. In reality, Motta\u2019s words had been grossly misinterpreted. Asked which formation he preferred during an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport, he sought to make the point that the numbers do not really matter \u2013 since modern football is a fluid game in which a team must constantly readjust its shape. To reinforce his point that formations themselves were abstract, Motta proposed that you could read a 4-3-3 formation as a 2-7-2 if you read it from left to right (ie: two players in the wide left zone, seven in the middle, two in the right) instead of going from back to front. None of which stopped the papers from comparing him to Oronzo Can\u00e0, the central character from cult 1980s football coaching parody L\u2019Allenatore nel Pallone, who proposed that his team line up in a 5-5-5. Whether Motta is ready to manage at this level, only time will tell. Although his substitutions worked out gloriously against Brescia, it is also true his initial team selection had flaws \u2013 with Ivan Radovanovic looking lost after being drawn back from his usual spot in midfield to play at centre-back, and Pinamonti underwhelming as a lone centre-forward. Genoa had almost 65% possession in the first half, but took a total of just four shots. Motta is not even fully qualified, and must continue to take courses at Coverciano in order to obtain his Uefa Pro licence. On the other hand, that may matter less in the long run than the insights he gained from working under the likes of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at Inter and Carlo Ancelotti in Paris. He won a treble with the former, as did Pandev. Asked about the experience of coaching a former teammate, Motta noted that the Macedonian has had no problem calling him \u201cMister\u201d \u2013 the Italian equivalent to \u201cBoss\u201d. It is Gasperini, though, that Motta cites as the greatest influence on his coaching ideas. \u201cI learned so much from him,\u201d he said after taking the Genoa job. \u201cIt is an honour to be in charge of the team where he used to manage me.\u201d He would do well to follow in the footsteps of Gasperini, whose seven-and-a-half years in charge of Genoa \u2013 split across two stints \u2013 represent the most successful periods of the club\u2019s recent history. No other manager has even made it through a complete season in charge of the club since it returned to Serie A in 2007. For now, it would be enough for Motta simply to steer Genoa away from the relegation zone. To take a team that has often been bullied this season, and teach it how to fight back. Talking points \u2022 No new manager bounce, then, for Stefano Pioli at Milan. After drawing his first game, against Lecce, the Rossoneri followed up with a defeat to Roma, courtesy of two goals that felt so avoidable. Franck Kessi\u00e9 left Edin Dzeko unmarked at the back post for the opening goal, before Davide Calabria simply passed the ball straight to the striker \u2013 who moved it on, via a deflection, to Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo \u2013 for the winner. \u2022 Ciro Immobile\u2019s 89th-minute winner at Fiorentina was his 10th goal of this league season. Only three players have ever hit double figures after nine games before, and one of those was Immobile himself \u2013 in 2017-18. That said, it\u2019s a mystery how this one was allowed to stand after the move began with what looked like an obvious foul by Jordan Lukaku on Riccardo Sottil. \u2022 Interesting to note the different reactions of the front-runners\u2019 managers to their respective draws. Carlo Ancelotti, as usual, sought to minimise the implications of a single result, saying he was happy with Napoli\u2019s performance. Maurizio Sarri mostly had to field questions about his decision to rest a tired Ronaldo, but acknowledged some flaws in Juventus\u2019s display, from a lack of ruthlessness up front to a passivity when in the lead. Antonio Conte, meanwhile, seemed to call for new signings, when he highlighted recent injuries and asserted his Inter squad did not have enough depth to cope with so many games in quick succession.",

      "bodyText": "Footage of the US special forces raid on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s Syrian compound reportedly consisted of overhead surveillance footage and no audio, prompting questions over the extent of the dramatic licence taken by Donald Trump in describing the final moments of one of the most wanted terrorists in the world. US officials who also watched the feed have declined to echo details of Trump\u2019s macabre account of the Isis\u2019s leader death on Saturday, including that Baghdadi was \u201cwhimpering, crying and screaming all the way\u201d. Revelling in a major national security accomplishment in his press conference on Sunday morning, Trump said Baghdadi, 48, had \u201cspent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread\u201d as a US military dog pursued him and three of his children down a dead-end tunnel. Cornered, Baghdadi detonated his suicide vest, killing himself, his children and injuring the \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201ctalented\u201d dog, Trump said. The White House monitored the Syria operation through video feeds that Trump said was \u201cas though you were watching a movie\u201d. The footage piped into the situation room would have consisted of overhead surveillance shots of the dark compound with heat signatures differentiating between US fighters and others, intelligence and military officials told the New York Times. Those cameras would not have been able to peer into the tunnel where Baghdadi died, nor provide audio proof of his conduct during the last minutes of his life. The soldiers involved would have been wearing body cameras, but that footage was yet to be given to the White House at the time of Trump\u2019s press conference, the Times report said. The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, declined to endorse aspects of Trump\u2019s cinematic account in an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week programme on Sunday morning. \u201cI don\u2019t have those details,\u201d Esper said, when pressed on how Trump knew Baghdadi had whimpered and cried. \u201cThe president probably had the opportunity to talk to commanders on the ground.\u201d The US national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, told the Meet the Press show that Baghdadi\u2019s remains, which were said to have been mutilated by the explosion, would likely be disposed of at sea. Asked if the body would be handled in the same way as Osama bin Laden\u2019s, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cI would expect that to be the case.\u201d Kurdish officials claimed on Sunday night that a second US operation had taken place in Syria a few hours after Baghadi\u2019s death, this time targeting the Islamic State spokesman, known as Abu Hassan al-Muhajir. \u201cAl-Muhajir, the right-hand of Baghdadi and the spokesman for IS, was targeted in the village of Ain al-Baydah near Jarablus, in a coordinated operation between SDF intelligence and the US army,\u201d the Syrian Democratic Forces commander, Mazloum Abdi, tweeted. American officials did not confirm the reports and it was unclear if the operation was pre-planned, or enabled by the material found in Baghdadi\u2019s compound. Trump said US fighters collected highly sensitive material and information, including on Isis\u2019s future plans, before they left Baghdadi\u2019s compound. Muhajir issued his last statement in March, calling for retaliation for the mass shooting of 50 worshippers at a mosque in the New Zealand city of Christchurch allegedly by an Australian white nationalist.",

Authorities expanded evacuations throughout the week, extending them again as the fire spread into the edges of the small towns of Windsor and Healdsburg. By Sunday evening, more than 185,000 people had been ordered to leave their homes, while the Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) utility cut power to millions of people in an effort to prevent its wind-damaged equipment from sparking further blazes.</p> \n<p>For many Sonoma county residents, Sunday\u2019s horror came in its unsettling similarity to the devastating 2017 North Bay firestorm that killed 44 people, destroyed thousands of homes and burned roughly 245,000 acres \u2013 a recent, ravaging trauma from which so many are still attempting to recover.</p> \n<p>The Kincade fire<strong> </strong>remained a fraction of that size. </p> \n<p>Coffey Park, a dense neighborhood in north Santa Rosa, is deep in the midst of rebuilding after it was all but destroyed in 2017. Freshly painted new homes stand next to naked wood frames, next to still empty lots, dry lumber piled on gravel. One homeowner evacuated with a hose still spraying over the fresh wood chips in their front yard.</p> \n<p>With smoke from the fire bearing down, many Coffey Park residents had evacuated, but Ken Herland stood outside, watering his yard and the new wooden fence surrounding it with a garden hose. Herland has only lived in this house since July.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe just put a new metal roof on the house,\u201d he said as he worked the hose. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving.

She watched a neighbor\u2019s video of the fire on her phone.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe ranch isn\u2019t on fire yet,\u201d she reported back. \u201cSo far, we\u2019re looking good.

      "bodyText": "The wind whipped through the flats of Sonoma county on Sunday morning, spreading dry autumn leaves and oily shreds of eucalyptus through the streets of downtown Santa Rosa. Late the night before, authorities had ordered parts of this north San Francisco Bay area city to evacuate along with much of the surrounding county, as the wind-swept Kincade fire burned eight miles north-east. Debbie, who declined to give her last name, stood in the doorway of her home in Coffey Park that she recently, finally finished rebuilding after it was destroyed by wildfire in 2017. She covered her face with both hands. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving again. This time I\u2019m gonna stay and I\u2019m gonna burn in my house,\u201d she said. \u201cPG&amp;E has not learned anything? Are they trying to kill us?\u201d The Kincade fire first erupted last Wednesday but doubled in size on Sunday, fueled by extreme wind conditions that saw gusts reaching over 100mph in some mountainous peaks. Authorities expanded evacuations throughout the week, extending them again as the fire spread into the edges of the small towns of Windsor and Healdsburg. By Sunday evening, more than 185,000 people had been ordered to leave their homes, while the Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) utility cut power to millions of people in an effort to prevent its wind-damaged equipment from sparking further blazes. For many Sonoma county residents, Sunday\u2019s horror came in its unsettling similarity to the devastating 2017 North Bay firestorm that killed 44 people, destroyed thousands of homes and burned roughly 245,000 acres \u2013 a recent, ravaging trauma from which so many are still attempting to recover. The Kincade fire remained a fraction of that size. Coffey Park, a dense neighborhood in north Santa Rosa, is deep in the midst of rebuilding after it was all but destroyed in 2017. Freshly painted new homes stand next to naked wood frames, next to still empty lots, dry lumber piled on gravel. One homeowner evacuated with a hose still spraying over the fresh wood chips in their front yard. With smoke from the fire bearing down, many Coffey Park residents had evacuated, but Ken Herland stood outside, watering his yard and the new wooden fence surrounding it with a garden hose. Herland has only lived in this house since July. \u201cWe just put a new metal roof on the house,\u201d he said as he worked the hose. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. I left the last time.\u201d But, he said, \u201cThis time feels worse.\u201d This time is, objectively, not worse, and the large evacuation zones and many repeated warnings left residents far more time to prepare and leave before danger approached. Herland\u2019s daughter Jessica evacuated the horses at her ranch by the Pepperwood Preserve. She watched a neighbor\u2019s video of the fire on her phone. \u201cThe ranch isn\u2019t on fire yet,\u201d she reported back. \u201cSo far, we\u2019re looking good. I\u2019ll be hopeful until they tell me not to be.\u201d Later in the morning, a few miles to the north, smoke began to fill the streets in the town of Windsor, tinting the dry trees and the evacuated homes orange in the light. Two CalFire firefighters filled their truck\u2019s tank from a hydrant. By early afternoon, the fire would push to the outskirts of the town, where hundreds of firefighters worked to protect homes from spreading embers. Further south, evacuees had gathered at the Sonoma county fairgrounds, a temporary shelter and incident command for firefighters who had traveled from across the state, and the country, to fight the Kincade. The site was littered with stacks of hay bales and multicolored pumpkins in anticipation of a weekend Halloween event and petting zoo, since cancelled. Instead, the grounds were overflowing with evacuees who had nowhere else to go. New temporary residents watched the smoke billow up over town as the winds set the fire swirling at the edge of Windsor. The corrugated metal roofing on a barn building lifted and slammed down again with each gust. Michele Cochrane said she had evacuated her Camp Meeker home over 15 miles west of here to the sound of a second world war air raid siren, after officials had extended evacuation lines to the Pacific Ocean. \u201cWe were in the middle of dinner and there it blasts. The fire\u2019s not even close to us, and yet we have to go through this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just loaded everything up and came on in. But now I\u2019m glad we did because if you look at where the wind went, if there are any embers that way \u2026\u201d she trailed off, shaking her head. Cochrane has lived in the west county for roughly 40 years. She, her two sons and a roommate, along with two cats and two dogs were set up with cots and cages in the corner of a county fairgrounds building. A chicken was staying with a friend nearby. \u201cI\u2019d rather them do it this way than be like, knocking on people\u2019s doors at three in the morning,\u201d said her son John. \u201cAs much as we all really, really, really want to go home, we\u2019re staying until tomorrow morning.

      "bodyText": "A classical violinist is pleading for help from the public after leaving a 310-year-old violin worth \u00a3250,000 on a train. Stephen Morris forgot to pick up his handmade David Tecchler violin as he left the London to Orpington service at Penge East last Tuesday night. Dated to 1709, the instrument was one of only a few made by Tecchler, a master craftsman considered to be the leading violin and cello maker of the renowned Roman school of violin-making. Morris described the violin as \u201ca piece of history\u201d and is urging anyone who found it to return it. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to lose it and quite apart from its value, it\u2019s my livelihood,\u201d he told BBC News. \u201cI was really only its custodian \u2013 one of many people who have played it \u2013 and I had hoped to pass it on to another violinist eventually.\u201d The recently restored violin was in a white case when Morris left it on the train, which departed from Victoria at 11.58pm. Inside, it is marked with Tecchler\u2019s name. Morris reported it to lost luggage and police, but no one had handed it in. He said British Transport Police told him they would look through CCTV footage from the journey to see if they could spot anyone leaving the train with the violin. Morris has led a number of UK orchestras and performed as a soloist alongside the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, BBC Concert Orchestra, Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra and as guest soloist director with the Scottish Ensemble and Locrian Ensemble. As a session musician, he has recorded with James Brown, Stevie Wonder, David Gilmour and U2. Losing the violin was \u201clike having my arm cut off\u201d, he told BBC News.",

Arsenal\u2019s captain Granit Xhaka was subjected to cruel boos from his own fans as his team imploded again in a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace.

A former financial journalist and the brother of the ex-Conservative minister Amber Rudd, he chairs Open Britain, the best-known constituent part of People\u2019s Vote. Rival factions within the organisation had feared Rudd was trying to seized control by forming a new company, <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/12164827\">Baybridge 2019 Ltd</a>, in August, seemingly aimed at leading a remain-focused campaign.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>James McGrory</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The director of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, who was among senior staff dismissed by Rudd on Sunday, McGrory was head press officer for Nick Clegg when the then Lib Dem leader was deputy prime minister in the coalition government. He then undertook the same role in the Brexit referendum for pro-remain group Britain Stronger in Europe. Known to journalists as approachable and eager, McGrory initially led on media briefings for People\u2019s Vote before taking a more background leadership role.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Tom Baldwin</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The former political journalist, who was spokesman for Ed Miliband until the then Labour leader\u2019s tenure ended with the 2015 election, joined People\u2019s Vote as director of communications in August last year and has been an energetic and regular briefer and spinner of the campaign\u2019s view to journalists ever since. Baldwin has also been the public face of opposition to Rudd\u2019s coup, describing the action as \u2018putting a wrecking ball through the campaign\u2019.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Peter Mandelson</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>While the New Labour grandee has long been close to Rudd \u2013 he is godfather to one of Rudd\u2019s children \u2013 he is on the other side of the People\u2019s Vote split, with leaked emails suggesting he was seeking to reduce Rudd\u2019s control of the campaign. A leading pro-EU figure for decades, Mandelson was a senior minister in Tony Blair\u2019s government and then an EU commissioner. He became a peer in 2008.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Patrick Heneghan</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Parachuted in by Rudd to be interim chief executive of People\u2019s Vote, Heneghan is a former head of elections for the Labour party. He held that role for some of Ed Miliband\u2019s period as leader, thus crossing over with Baldwin. A long-standing grassroots organiser, Heneghan rose from local campaigns to key roles in Labour\u2019s 2010 and 2015 campaigns. He has spent recent months as head of the European Movement, a long-standing pro-Europe organisation set up in 1949.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Rudd told staff he would address a meeting at 9am on Monday but he did not attend after Baldwin and McGrory turned up to work as usual. Instead, he appeared on Sky News to defend the reorganisation and sent Heneghan in his place.</p> \n<p>About 35 staff members working for the various organisations that make up People\u2019s Vote decided to walk out of the office in protest at Rudd\u2019s actions, with only a handful left in the building.</p> \n<p>They were told by email that they should take the day off and regroup with Rudd on Tuesday. In an escalation of the tensions, one People\u2019s Vote source said Baldwin and McGrory had then been threatened with legal action for trespass.</p> \n<p>Influential figures in the second referendum movement questioned the legitimacy of the sackings. Alastair Campbell, a former Labour spokesman and People\u2019s Vote campaigner, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/campbellclaret/status/1188577738455691264\">tweeted</a>: \u201cBefore people get too excited, a few facts \u2026 @RolandRudd is chair of Open Britain. He styles himself as chair of PV but this has never been agreed by all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Campbell claimed Rudd did \u201cnot have the right\u201d to sack McGrory and Baldwin and appoint Heneghan as interim chief executive.</p> \n<p>Stephen Dorrell, the chairman of European Movement UK, another organisation under the People\u2019s Vote umbrella, echoed Campbell in voicing concern about the legitimacy of the firings. He said: \u201cRoland Rudd is chair of Open Britain; the People\u2019s Vote campaign includes European Movement and other partners who were not consulted about untimely management changes in Open Britain.\u201d</p> \n<p>The changes follow major disagreements within the People\u2019s Vote campaign that have been developing for months about the movement\u2019s direction and strategy.</p> \n<p>Tension has stemmed from Rudd\u2019s desire to move the campaign towards a more pro-remain position, with the campaign directors focusing on winning over soft leave voters and undecided Labour and Conservative members of parliament.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"af3543e4-baf3-4816-b2ac-fb6f5cb5d082\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lnl7aDkaPTI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Baldwin, who was previously Ed Miliband\u2019s spokesman, said Rudd did not have the authority to dismiss anyone.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s making the mistake that I think a lot of businessmen do when they dabble in politics, which is to think that because they have a certain title and a board they then own the campaign,\u201d Baldwin said. He said Rudd had made a \u201cgrotesque misjudgment\u201d by proceeding with a reorganisation at such a time.</p> \n<p>Baldwin added: \u201cThe clue\u2019s in the title \u2013 People\u2019s Vote campaign belongs to the people, not just one businessman who is hardly ever seen in the campaign. I think he\u2019s been in the office three or four times in the last 18 months. It\u2019s really not for him to tell the campaign what to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adding to the confusion, Rudd later appeared to argue that Baldwin had not been sacked, just moved so Heneghan could be the \u201cone person to be in charge\u201d.</p> \n<p>Baldwin \u201chas an opportunity for a different type of role, which is allowing one person to take up the reins and actually lead this thing\u201d, Rudd told the BBC\u2019s Today programme, saying they \u201cneed to have a proper, civilised chat about it\u201d.</p> \n<p>Rudd said one issue had been criticism within the campaign of Labour and the Liberal Democrats: \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to write off any one particular party or any leadership.\u201d</p> \n<p>As part of the power struggle, Rudd has formed a new company to oversee a remain campaign in the event of a second referendum, even though parliament is still some way off support for one.</p>",

The campaign was in disarray on Monday after James McGrory, the director, and Tom Baldwin, the head of communications, were asked to leave with immediate effect. Rudd, who is the chairman of Open Britain, one of the organisations that makes up the People\u2019s Vote campaign, sent an email to staffers on Sunday night saying it would be moving on to a \u201cmore structured basis\u201d. Patrick Heneghan, a former head of campaigns for the Labour party, was then appointed temporarily as acting chief executive of People\u2019s Vote. Rudd told staff he would address a meeting at 9am on Monday but he did not attend after Baldwin and McGrory turned up to work as usual. Instead, he appeared on Sky News to defend the reorganisation and sent Heneghan in his place. About 35 staff members working for the various organisations that make up People\u2019s Vote decided to walk out of the office in protest at Rudd\u2019s actions, with only a handful left in the building.

In an escalation of the tensions, one People\u2019s Vote source said Baldwin and McGrory had then been threatened with legal action for trespass. Influential figures in the second referendum movement questioned the legitimacy of the sackings. Alastair Campbell, a former Labour spokesman and People\u2019s Vote campaigner, tweeted: \u201cBefore people get too excited, a few facts \u2026 @RolandRudd is chair of Open Britain. He styles himself as chair of PV but this has never been agreed by all.\u201d Campbell claimed Rudd did \u201cnot have the right\u201d to sack McGrory and Baldwin and appoint Heneghan as interim chief executive. Stephen Dorrell, the chairman of European Movement UK, another organisation under the People\u2019s Vote umbrella, echoed Campbell in voicing concern about the legitimacy of the firings. He said: \u201cRoland Rudd is chair of Open Britain; the People\u2019s Vote campaign includes European Movement and other partners who were not consulted about untimely management changes in Open Britain.\u201d The changes follow major disagreements within the People\u2019s Vote campaign that have been developing for months about the movement\u2019s direction and strategy. Tension has stemmed from Rudd\u2019s desire to move the campaign towards a more pro-remain position, with the campaign directors focusing on winning over soft leave voters and undecided Labour and Conservative members of parliament. Baldwin, who was previously Ed Miliband\u2019s spokesman, said Rudd did not have the authority to dismiss anyone. \u201cHe\u2019s making the mistake that I think a lot of businessmen do when they dabble in politics, which is to think that because they have a certain title and a board they then own the campaign,\u201d Baldwin said. He said Rudd had made a \u201cgrotesque misjudgment\u201d by proceeding with a reorganisation at such a time. Baldwin added: \u201cThe clue\u2019s in the title \u2013 People\u2019s Vote campaign belongs to the people, not just one businessman who is hardly ever seen in the campaign. I think he\u2019s been in the office three or four times in the last 18 months. It\u2019s really not for him to tell the campaign what to do.\u201d Adding to the confusion, Rudd later appeared to argue that Baldwin had not been sacked, just moved so Heneghan could be the \u201cone person to be in charge\u201d. Baldwin \u201chas an opportunity for a different type of role, which is allowing one person to take up the reins and actually lead this thing\u201d, Rudd told the BBC\u2019s Today programme, saying they \u201cneed to have a proper, civilised chat about it\u201d. Rudd said one issue had been criticism within the campaign of Labour and the Liberal Democrats: \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to write off any one particular party or any leadership.\u201d As part of the power struggle, Rudd has formed a new company to oversee a remain campaign in the event of a second referendum, even though parliament is still some way off support for one.",

      "body": "<p>Vladimir Bukovsky, who has died aged 76, was a Soviet dissident, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">Vladimir Putin</a> critic, and human rights campaigner. He exposed the Soviet use of psychiatry against political prisoners and thus played a key role in undermining communism in eastern Europe.</p> <p>Bukovsky was always modest about his achievements. He once said that it was the stupidity of those who ruled the Soviet Union that brought about its downfall. And yet together with a small group of fellow dissenters \u2013 he put their numbers at between 3,000 and 5,000 \u2013 in the 1960s and 1970s Bukovsky managed to chip away at Soviet power. He spent 12 years in a succession of prisons, labour camps and psychiatric hospitals. The KGB was his sworn enemy. They hated him and he hated them. Eventually, in 1976, they threw him out of the country.</p> <p>Bukovsky likened his struggle against the Kremlin to that of a Siberian bear who repeatedly climbs a tree to get to a piece of carrion. In the way is a large, heavy block of wood. The bear swats the wood aside and is bashed on the side of the head. Enraged, he hits the wood harder, with a more painful result. Eventually the bear falls unconscious from the tree. \u201cThis is an approximate description of my relations with the powers that be,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Still, sometimes the bear won. It was <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Yury-Vladimirovich-Andropov\" title=\"\">Yuri Andropov</a> \u2013 the KGB boss and future head of the politburo \u2013 who drew up a secret plan to use psychiatric facilities to \u201ctreat\u201d dissidents. It was based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/great-speeches-nikita-khrushchev\" title=\"\">Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s</a> belief that anti-Soviet consciousness was a mental disease. Political opponents including Bukovsky were detained without trial. There was no appeal. They were injected with psychotropic drugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e156bb021202239d5253a511636725876a990f9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e156bb021202239d5253a511636725876a990f9e/0_33_7015_4209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Bukovsky showing his Soviet passport on arrival at Heathrow Airport, 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Bukovsky showing his Soviet passport on arrival at Heathrow Airport, 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Saunders/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was Bukovsky who brought this abhorrent practice to the attention of the west. The campaign to end it became a demand from human rights groups during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/cold-war\" title=\"\">cold war</a>. The Soviet Union eventually dropped this state policy. Bukovsky unmasked the role played by doctors and Soviet medicine, and delegitimised those at the top who gave them orders.</p> <p>Bukovsky later transferred his antagonism to other Soviet and Russian leaders, in particular to Putin, of whom he said, \u201cI think he\u2019s evil.\u201d He was pessimistic about Russia\u2019s future. The KGB was still in charge of a country which, he predicted, was destined to implode. But he took pride in the post-communist liberation of eastern Europe. Of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary he told me: \u201cThere we achieved something.\u201d</p> <p>Bukovsky described his stubborn character as something given by nature. He was born in the Urals, in the autonomous republic of Bashkiria (now known as Bashkortostan). His parents, Konstantin and Nina, both journalists, had fled the German advance and returned to Moscow after the war finished. Bukovsky grew up in an overcrowded communal flat where his grandmother read him stories: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alexander-pushkin\" title=\"\">Alexander Pushkin</a>, Nikolay Nekrasov, the Brothers Grimm.</p> <p>His rebellion began early. At the age of 10, in March 1953, Bukovsky watched from the rooftop of the National hotel in Moscow as crowds pushed and surged to see the body of Stalin lying in state. At school Bukovsky had been taught that Stalin was a god. And yet the god was dead. This was a contradiction. Bukovsky\u2019s conclusion: he should think for himself and mistrust all authority.</p> <p>His adolescence coincided with a turbulent period in Soviet politics. In 1956, when Bukovsky was 14, Khrushchev admitted before the 20th party congress that Stalin had killed millions of people. Another turning point came the same year when Soviet tanks crushed the Hungarian uprising. Bukovsky was in total sympathy with his Hungarian peers fighting on the streets. \u201cWe wanted the same thing in Russia,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>His first act of defiance was to start a school literary magazine. In 1960 he and two friends began poetry readings, previously forbidden, in front of a statue of Vladimir Mayakovsky. These gatherings became popular; the KGB, Bukovsky noted wryly, were forced to read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/boris-pasternak\" title=\"\">Boris Pasternak</a>, Osip Mandelstam and Nikolay Gumilyov. Bukovsky was summoned for questioning. His parents, orthodox party members, were dismayed. Moscow University chucked him out.</p> <p>Then, in 1961, the KGB arrested Bukovsky for the first time. It was the beginning of a long odyssey through the Soviet punishment system. He was in pre-detention at Lefortovo prison and was then carted off to Moscow\u2019s notorious Serbsky institute for a psychiatric evaluation. Inside, Bukovsky discovered other political prisoners. Doctors told him his conflict with society meant he was crazy, a paranoiac. He politely demurred.</p> <p>Bukovsky was an exemplary detainee. He read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens\" title=\"\">Dickens</a> in English, charmed the elderly lieutenant colonel in charge, and became an expert on Soviet law. He was eventually let go. In 1965, however, the KGB arrested him again after a protest in Pushkin Square. A trial and more labour camps followed. He was shipped to Leningrad, Vladimir and Perm; his reputation as an incorrigible state enemy grew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d849ce58374656661fde9a3ef50f6280d89181b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d849ce58374656661fde9a3ef50f6280d89181b1/0_376_6799_4080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Bukovsky in exile in 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Bukovsky in exile in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Bown/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bukovsky learned how to manipulate the system, and taught others to do the same. He went on hunger strike 20 times. Sometimes this worked: in one camp the entire prison, including career criminals, joined him in an attempt to improve medical treatment. Mostly it did not. In Lefortovo, after 12 days, warders force-fed him through the nose, an intensely painful experience. He filed letters of complaint.</p> <p>His autobiography, published in English in 1978 as To Build a Castle and in Russian under the title And the Wind Returns, gives a vivid portrait of life in Soviet jail. He wrote: \u201cStrange things happened to time. On the one hand it seemed to pass with preternatural speed, beggaring belief. The entire daily routine with its ordinary, monotonously repetitive events \u2013 reveille, breakfast, exercise, dinner, supper, lights out, reveille, breakfast \u2013 fused into a sort of yellowish-brown blur, leaving nothing for the mind to cling to.</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand the same time could crawl with agonising slowness: it would seem as if a whole year had gone by, but no, it was still the same old month, and no end was in sight.\u201d</p> <p>By 1976 prison governors had grown terrified of Bukovsky. His mere presence, they believed, would cause other inmates to mutiny. The politburo decided to expel him to Switzerland, dumping him on a plane. Bukovsky settled in Cambridge.

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Bukovsky, who has died aged 76, was a Soviet dissident, Vladimir Putin critic, and human rights campaigner. He exposed the Soviet use of psychiatry against political prisoners and thus played a key role in undermining communism in eastern Europe. Bukovsky was always modest about his achievements. He once said that it was the stupidity of those who ruled the Soviet Union that brought about its downfall. And yet together with a small group of fellow dissenters \u2013 he put their numbers at between 3,000 and 5,000 \u2013 in the 1960s and 1970s Bukovsky managed to chip away at Soviet power. He spent 12 years in a succession of prisons, labour camps and psychiatric hospitals. The KGB was his sworn enemy. They hated him and he hated them. Eventually, in 1976, they threw him out of the country. Bukovsky likened his struggle against the Kremlin to that of a Siberian bear who repeatedly climbs a tree to get to a piece of carrion. In the way is a large, heavy block of wood. The bear swats the wood aside and is bashed on the side of the head. Enraged, he hits the wood harder, with a more painful result. Eventually the bear falls unconscious from the tree. \u201cThis is an approximate description of my relations with the powers that be,\u201d he wrote. Still, sometimes the bear won. It was Yuri Andropov \u2013 the KGB boss and future head of the politburo \u2013 who drew up a secret plan to use psychiatric facilities to \u201ctreat\u201d dissidents. It was based on Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s belief that anti-Soviet consciousness was a mental disease. Political opponents including Bukovsky were detained without trial. There was no appeal. They were injected with psychotropic drugs. It was Bukovsky who brought this abhorrent practice to the attention of the west. The campaign to end it became a demand from human rights groups during the cold war. The Soviet Union eventually dropped this state policy. Bukovsky unmasked the role played by doctors and Soviet medicine, and delegitimised those at the top who gave them orders. Bukovsky later transferred his antagonism to other Soviet and Russian leaders, in particular to Putin, of whom he said, \u201cI think he\u2019s evil.\u201d He was pessimistic about Russia\u2019s future. The KGB was still in charge of a country which, he predicted, was destined to implode. But he took pride in the post-communist liberation of eastern Europe. Of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary he told me: \u201cThere we achieved something.\u201d Bukovsky described his stubborn character as something given by nature. He was born in the Urals, in the autonomous republic of Bashkiria (now known as Bashkortostan). His parents, Konstantin and Nina, both journalists, had fled the German advance and returned to Moscow after the war finished. Bukovsky grew up in an overcrowded communal flat where his grandmother read him stories: Alexander Pushkin, Nikolay Nekrasov, the Brothers Grimm. His rebellion began early. At the age of 10, in March 1953, Bukovsky watched from the rooftop of the National hotel in Moscow as crowds pushed and surged to see the body of Stalin lying in state. At school Bukovsky had been taught that Stalin was a god. And yet the god was dead. This was a contradiction. Bukovsky\u2019s conclusion: he should think for himself and mistrust all authority. His adolescence coincided with a turbulent period in Soviet politics. In 1956, when Bukovsky was 14, Khrushchev admitted before the 20th party congress that Stalin had killed millions of people. Another turning point came the same year when Soviet tanks crushed the Hungarian uprising. Bukovsky was in total sympathy with his Hungarian peers fighting on the streets. \u201cWe wanted the same thing in Russia,\u201d he told me. His first act of defiance was to start a school literary magazine. In 1960 he and two friends began poetry readings, previously forbidden, in front of a statue of Vladimir Mayakovsky. These gatherings became popular; the KGB, Bukovsky noted wryly, were forced to read Boris Pasternak, Osip Mandelstam and Nikolay Gumilyov. Bukovsky was summoned for questioning. His parents, orthodox party members, were dismayed. Moscow University chucked him out. Then, in 1961, the KGB arrested Bukovsky for the first time. It was the beginning of a long odyssey through the Soviet punishment system. He was in pre-detention at Lefortovo prison and was then carted off to Moscow\u2019s notorious Serbsky institute for a psychiatric evaluation. Inside, Bukovsky discovered other political prisoners. Doctors told him his conflict with society meant he was crazy, a paranoiac. He politely demurred. Bukovsky was an exemplary detainee. He read Dickens in English, charmed the elderly lieutenant colonel in charge, and became an expert on Soviet law. He was eventually let go. In 1965, however, the KGB arrested him again after a protest in Pushkin Square. A trial and more labour camps followed. He was shipped to Leningrad, Vladimir and Perm; his reputation as an incorrigible state enemy grew. Bukovsky learned how to manipulate the system, and taught others to do the same. He went on hunger strike 20 times. Sometimes this worked: in one camp the entire prison, including career criminals, joined him in an attempt to improve medical treatment. Mostly it did not. In Lefortovo, after 12 days, warders force-fed him through the nose, an intensely painful experience. He filed letters of complaint. His autobiography, published in English in 1978 as To Build a Castle and in Russian under the title And the Wind Returns, gives a vivid portrait of life in Soviet jail. He wrote: \u201cStrange things happened to time. On the one hand it seemed to pass with preternatural speed, beggaring belief. The entire daily routine with its ordinary, monotonously repetitive events \u2013 reveille, breakfast, exercise, dinner, supper, lights out, reveille, breakfast \u2013 fused into a sort of yellowish-brown blur, leaving nothing for the mind to cling to. \u201cOn the other hand the same time could crawl with agonising slowness: it would seem as if a whole year had gone by, but no, it was still the same old month, and no end was in sight.\u201d By 1976 prison governors had grown terrified of Bukovsky. His mere presence, they believed, would cause other inmates to mutiny. The politburo decided to expel him to Switzerland, dumping him on a plane. Bukovsky settled in Cambridge. His home, a crumbling suburban property on the outskirts of town in Gilbert Road, became a site of pilgrimage for fans and for others who had fallen out with Kremlin power. In exile, Bukovsky completed his studies in neurophysiology, wrote his memoir and continued his campaign against the Soviet Union. He became an informal adviser to Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Thatcher appreciated his frankness; she consulted him before her first meeting with the politburo\u2019s new chief, Mikhail Gorbachev. The early cold war debate in the west was whether to be friends with Moscow, or to have a nuclear war. According to Bukovsky, both Thatcher and Reagan told him that thanks to the small-scale dissident movement they realised the Soviet Union could be defeated without a shot being fired, by moral confrontation. Bukovsky was grateful to Britain for giving him a home. He was a vehement opponent of the European Union, seeing in it a form of totalitarianism familiar from his long anti-Soviet struggle. A heavy smoker \u2013 a packet of Dunhill cigarettes was never far away \u2013 he believed that the UK was being slowly Sovietised, with needless laws, smoking bans and restrictions on individual liberty. When Putin became president, Bukovsky was quick to realise what this meant for Russia: the KGB was back. He supported Russia\u2019s fissiparous democratic opposition, which found itself slowly and ruthlessly strangled. In 2007, he tried to stand as a presidential candidate against Dmitry Medvedev, Putin\u2019s seat-warming successor. The Kremlin disqualified him. Bukovsky became a mentor to Alexander Litvinenko, an officer of the FSB, the Russian Federal Security Service, who escaped to the UK in 2000. Bukovsky recalled walking with Litvinenko in Cambridge, on a sunny morning in 2003. Litvinenko got a chilling call from Moscow. It was a former FSB colleague.

Aurora Thunder (1.00) has the best form in the opener and can be backed at 5-2, while I\u2019m surprised to see Rightdownthemiddle (3.20) drifting to 2-1 for the staying handicap hurdle. This veteran is back with Gordon Elliott, having dropped two stones down the ratings during a 10-month spell with Sean Curran. Maybe this won\u2019t be his day but I wouldn\u2019t be betting against him. The nap is at Kempton, where Bryn Du (5.30) runs in a nursery with Oisin Murphy taking over in the saddle. William Haggas\u2019s lowly rated colt put up his best effort yet in a first-time tongue tie when third at Newcastle recently and gets to run from the same mark here. He\u2019s 6-4.",

Wilm\u00e8s succeeds the liberal leader Charles Michel, who will become president of the European council on 1 December. Her role has been described as a poisoned chalice, as linguistically divided parties struggle to form a government. Belgium has had a caretaker government since December last year when Michel\u2019s four-party coalition collapsed as the Flemish nationalists quit in protest at a UN migration pact. Elections in late May have so far failed to yield a fresh government and reinforced the country\u2019s political divide, with the wealthier Dutch-speaking Flemish north voting in large numbers for the nationalist right, while the francophone south handed victory to traditional socialists. Describing her appointment as a \u201cgreat honour and a great responsibility\u201d, Wilm\u00e8s acknowledged leading a caretaker government \u201cdoes not leave us with much opportunity to act\u201d and urged the formation of a fully fledged government as soon as possible. Belgium went 541 days without a government in 2010-11, a world record for a country in peacetime.

Her task as prime minister is complicated by being a member of the francophone liberal party, which lost ground in the May elections and is only the fourth-largest party. Wilm\u00e8s is seen as an ally of the outgoing prime minister and has been criticised in the fiscally conservative northern Flanders region for not doing more to deliver a balanced budget.

      "bodyText": "The BBC presenter Samira Ahmed has launched a landmark equal pay case, claiming she was paid 85% less than her male equivalent. Ahmed was cheered when she arrived at the central London employment tribunal on Monday morning. She was accompanied by colleagues and supporters, including the BBC Breakfast show presenter Naga Munchetty and the broadcaster Aasmah Mir. Ahmed will demand hundreds of thousands of pounds in back pay for her work on the BBC programme Newswatch, which she has presented since 2012 and received \u00a3440 an episode for. She will claim her male equivalent at the broadcaster was Jeremy Vine, who was paid as much as \u00a33,000 a show for his work on the Points of View programme. Ahmed\u2019s legal case, supported by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), will argue both Newswatch and Points of View are presenter-led programmes lasting about 15 minutes that offer the public the opportunity to air their views on BBC content, and that she has a right to equal pay for equal work. The corporation\u2019s legal team, however, will argue the two presenters were not doing the same or similar work because the programmes are different formats for different audiences. Although Ahmed was accompanied by female BBC colleagues, many were reluctant to talk to journalists owing to their work for the organisation, while some are also pursuing pay complaints. Another supporter, the poet Lemn Sissay, who is the chancellor of the University of Manchester, said he wanted to show solidarity with Ahmed and all the women bringing equal pay cases against the BBC. \u201cI would hope if I was in a similar situation, people would support me too. Like Samira, I love the BBC and this action is for the betterment of the BBC. We are here to improve the practice of an organisation that we love,\u201d he said. Ahmed has secured an agreement from the BBC for full backdated pay for her work on Radio 4\u2019s Front Row and Radio 3\u2019s Night Waves/Free Thinking, the NUJ said, where the pay gap between Ahmed and her male equivalents was 50% and 33% respectively. \u201cI love my job on Newswatch, despite it being difficult and challenging,\u201d Ahmed said in a statement. \u201cI know that it is an important part of demonstrating the BBC service to all its audiences and the licence-fee payers. \u201cI have a sense of pride working for a public service broadcaster which seeks to represent the diversity of Britain and its licence-fee payers. \u201cOn the back of my BBC ID card are written the BBC values, which include \u2018we respect each other and celebrate our diversity\u2019 and \u2018we take pride in delivering quality and value for money\u2019.

The 19-year-old is not far off though and Unai Emery has given him an active role in Arsenal\u2019s cup games. Had it not been for a concussion sustained in the third round against Nottingham Forest he might have featured more this season but he has shown enough to suggest a stage such as Anfield will not faze him. Smith-Rowe, a rangy figure at 6ft, can operate on the flanks or in an attacking midfield role and is a positive, incisive influence who never shies from receiving the ball and trying to make things happen.

And many Republicans seem to prefer stupid political stunts (like <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-the-republicans-sink-even-lower-20191023-6l7twomxafad3aqf7o57lsn6ku-story.html\">the invasion of a secure room in the Capitol</a> where impeachment hearings were being held) to the hard work of policymaking.</p> <p>That\u2019s why it made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/24/education-official-resigns-senate-student-loan-debt-forgiveness\">headlines</a> when A Wayne Johnson, a former senior official in Trump\u2019s education department, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/student-loan-official-in-trump-administration-resigns-proposes-plan-to-wipe-out-student-debt-71992901953\">recently announced a plan</a> to forgive hundreds of billions of dollars of federal student loan debt. Johnson is a long-shot candidate seeking appointment to a soon-to-be-vacant US Senate seat, and his plan is unlikely to be enacted anytime soon. But it is rare indeed to see a Republican official seeming to side with left-leaning Democratic presidential candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren (who have <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2019/06/27/how-do-warrens-and-sanders-student-loan-forgiveness-plans-compare/#7508450a18c4\">both proposed</a> major debt-forgiveness plans) against his former boss, the education secretary, Betsy DeVos (who has called such proposals \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/10/24/betsy-devos-cancel-student-loan-debt/#2a48cce44bc9\">crazy</a>\u201d).

Some 45 million Americans have student loans, and student debt has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-look-to-break-governments-hold-on-student-loan-market-1520418600\">doubled</a> over the past decade. The overall national student debt is $1.6tn, which is expected to balloon further to $2tn by 2022. Nearly a fifth of borrowers who are not presently enrolled in school are at least 90 days delinquent in their payments. Student loan debt exceeds both credit card debts and auto loans, and appears to be damaging the economy by causing young people to <a href=\"https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2015/wp15-26.pdf\">put off</a> marriage, childbirth, home ownership and small business formation.</p> <p>Johnson, who oversaw the Office of Federal Student Aid in the Trump administration, points to repayment trends that suggest much of the student loan debt will never be repaid. <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2019/10/24/trump-education-official-to-resign-run-for-senate.html\">The debt burden</a>, he says, \u201crides on [debtors\u2019] credit files \u2013 it rides on their backs \u2013 for decades.

But the most serious and menacing scandal features Bolsonaro\u2019s eldest son, Fl\u00e1vio, who is a federal senator.</p> <p>At the end of 2018, the media <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/americas/scandal-involving-brazil-president-elects-son-clouds-inauguration\">reported that</a> one of Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s aides, the former military police officer Fabr\u00edcio Queiroz, had for years been depositing sums of money into Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s personal bank account. The Intercept (co-founded by my husband Glenn Greenwald) subsequently <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/07/21/in-secret-chats-brazils-chief-corruption-prosecutor-worried-that-bolsonaros-justice-minister-would-protect-bolsonaros-senator-son-flavio-from-scandals/\">published</a> secret chats showing that Brazilian prosecutors agreed that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that the deposits were part of a common racket in which lawmakers employ \u201cghost\u201d employees who do no work and kick back part of their salaries.</p> <p>But this scandal transformed into something far darker and more grave: Queiroz, investigators have said, has ties to the violent and dangerous paramilitary gangs which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/12/brazil-militia-paramilitary-wield-terror-seize-power-from-drug-gangs\">now rule much of Rio de Janeiro</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That Bolsonaro's eldest son allegedly has such close ties to this paramilitary gang was terrifying but not surprising</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Worse, for more than a decade, Fl\u00e1vio <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-crime/son-of-brazil-president-faces-fresh-question-about-rio-aides-idUSKCN1PG2Q7\">employed</a> both the wife and the mother of Adriano Magalh\u00e3es da N\u00f3brega, the alleged leader of Rio\u2019s most powerful and violent paramilitary gang \u2013 the same gang investigators have concluded carried out the brutal assassination in 2018 of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s black, LGBT, favela-raised city councilwoman Marielle Franco. (Franco, a close friend of my family, served alongside me in the city council as a member of my party, the leftwing socialist PSOL, until she was murdered.) Fl\u00e1vio defended himself by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-crime/son-of-brazil-president-faces-fresh-question-about-rio-aides-idUSKCN1PG2Q7\">claiming</a> that the hiring had been \u201cat the indication of former aide Fabricio Queiroz\u201d.</p> <p>That the president\u2019s eldest son allegedly has such close ties to this paramilitary gang was terrifying but not entirely surprising. These \u201cmilitias\u201d, as they are known in Brazil, are largely composed of former and current members of the military police and military.</p> <p>Bolsonaro, a former army officer, has a history of praising these militias as well-intentioned vigilante groups dedicated to fighting crime. All three of his politician-sons \u2013 including his youngest political son, Eduardo, a former member of the federal police \u2013 have also praised these militias. Along with an anti-corruption persona and a demonisation campaign against LGBT people, Bolsonaro has made pledges to unleash the police and military to kill more suspected criminals central to his political platform.</p> <p>Still, the fact that Bolsonaro\u2019s son \u2013 a member of the most powerful political dynasty in Brazil \u2013 would be employing family members of this particular Rio militia shocked the nation. And those ties were even more disturbing when it became clear that Queiroz, the aide that Fl\u00e1vio claimed was responsible for hiring the family members of that militia, is linked to Bolsonaro and his wife, too.</p> <p>One of the unexplained deposits made by Queiroz includes one made <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption/brazil-presidents-son-misses-meeting-with-prosecutors-probing-payments-idUSKCN1P42DN\">to the personal bank account of Bolsonaro\u2019s wife, Michelle.</a> And photos revealed that Queiroz, aside from being Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s close aide for a full decade, seemed to enjoy a close friendship with Bolsonaro himself.</p> <p>Worse still, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/13/jair-bolsonaro-paramilitaries-marielle-franco-suspects\">photo surfaced in March</a> showing Bolsonaro grinning and draping his arm around one of the former police officers who is suspected of murdering Marielle Franco. That same week, Brazil learned that Bolsonaro\u2019s youngest son, Renan, had dated the daughter of the other police officer arrested for Marielle\u2019s murder.</p> <p>As the investigation into Fl\u00e1vio unfolded, the police attempted to interrogate Queiroz about how he could have come into possession of sums of money far in excess of his income as a political aide and former police officer. But after a bizarre television interview in which he vaguely claimed that he had become rich by virtue of his love for \u201cbuying and selling\u201d used cars, Queiroz disappeared completely: hidden in a neighborhood controlled by the same militia that murdered Marielle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bolsonaro has repeatedly used \u2013 or abused \u2013 his powers as president to block the investigation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The phrase \u201cWhere is Queiroz?\u201d has become a taunting internet meme used to symbolise the criminality at the heart of the Bolsonaro family as well as a protest against the stalled, and perhaps deliberately impeded, police investigation, which to date has arrested no one. Brazil\u2019s largest news magazine, Veja, recently published a cover story announcing that, unlike the Rio police, it had succeeded in \u201cfinding Queiroz\u201d: living in a wealthy neighborhood near Brazil\u2019s most expensive private hospital, where he regularly goes for treatment.</p> <p>Bolsonaro has repeatedly used \u2013 or abused \u2013 his powers as president to block the investigation into the still-mysterious deposits made into the bank account of his eldest son and his wife. The president has all but relinquished his reputation as an anti-corruption crusader with his now-obvious fixation on ensuring that no investigation is permitted to proceed.</p> <p>Bolsonaro has <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-atropela-policia-federal-e-anuncia-troca-de-superintendente-no-rio.shtml\">removed officials</a> from the branch of the federal police investigating Fl\u00e1vio and Queiroz. He is <a href=\"https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2019/08/28/apos-declaracoes-de-bolsonaro-superintendente-da-pf-do-rio-vai-trabalhar-no-exterior.ghtml\">threatening</a> to change the leadership of the Rio branch of the federal police and replace them with loyalists to his family. He has <a href=\"http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/politica/noticia/2019-08/bolsonaro-transferira-coaf-para-o-banco-central-medida-provisoria\">stripped</a> the agency that discovered Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s suspicious financial movements of virtually all of its authorities. He <a href=\"https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/opiniao/editoriais/excessos-da-lava-jato-narrativa-equivocada-e-preocupante/\">appointed</a> as chief prosecutor a man who is openly critical of the anti-corruption investigation that S\u00e9rgio Moro led.

      "bodyText": "There is a towering paradox at the heart of Brazilian politics: the country\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, was elected on an anti-corruption platform \u2013 music to the ears of a population that has been victimised for decades by systemic corruption. But the \u201canti-corruption\u201d president and his family are now subsumed by multiple corruption scandals suggesting serious criminality. All three of Bolsonaro\u2019s politically active sons, along with his wife Michelle, have been implicated in corruption scandals. But the most serious and menacing scandal features Bolsonaro\u2019s eldest son, Fl\u00e1vio, who is a federal senator. At the end of 2018, the media reported that one of Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s aides, the former military police officer Fabr\u00edcio Queiroz, had for years been depositing sums of money into Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s personal bank account. The Intercept (co-founded by my husband Glenn Greenwald) subsequently published secret chats showing that Brazilian prosecutors agreed that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that the deposits were part of a common racket in which lawmakers employ \u201cghost\u201d employees who do no work and kick back part of their salaries. But this scandal transformed into something far darker and more grave: Queiroz, investigators have said, has ties to the violent and dangerous paramilitary gangs which now rule much of Rio de Janeiro. Worse, for more than a decade, Fl\u00e1vio employed both the wife and the mother of Adriano Magalh\u00e3es da N\u00f3brega, the alleged leader of Rio\u2019s most powerful and violent paramilitary gang \u2013 the same gang investigators have concluded carried out the brutal assassination in 2018 of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s black, LGBT, favela-raised city councilwoman Marielle Franco. (Franco, a close friend of my family, served alongside me in the city council as a member of my party, the leftwing socialist PSOL, until she was murdered.) Fl\u00e1vio defended himself by claiming that the hiring had been \u201cat the indication of former aide Fabricio Queiroz\u201d. That the president\u2019s eldest son allegedly has such close ties to this paramilitary gang was terrifying but not entirely surprising. These \u201cmilitias\u201d, as they are known in Brazil, are largely composed of former and current members of the military police and military. Bolsonaro, a former army officer, has a history of praising these militias as well-intentioned vigilante groups dedicated to fighting crime. All three of his politician-sons \u2013 including his youngest political son, Eduardo, a former member of the federal police \u2013 have also praised these militias. Along with an anti-corruption persona and a demonisation campaign against LGBT people, Bolsonaro has made pledges to unleash the police and military to kill more suspected criminals central to his political platform. Still, the fact that Bolsonaro\u2019s son \u2013 a member of the most powerful political dynasty in Brazil \u2013 would be employing family members of this particular Rio militia shocked the nation. And those ties were even more disturbing when it became clear that Queiroz, the aide that Fl\u00e1vio claimed was responsible for hiring the family members of that militia, is linked to Bolsonaro and his wife, too. One of the unexplained deposits made by Queiroz includes one made to the personal bank account of Bolsonaro\u2019s wife, Michelle. And photos revealed that Queiroz, aside from being Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s close aide for a full decade, seemed to enjoy a close friendship with Bolsonaro himself. Worse still, a photo surfaced in March showing Bolsonaro grinning and draping his arm around one of the former police officers who is suspected of murdering Marielle Franco. That same week, Brazil learned that Bolsonaro\u2019s youngest son, Renan, had dated the daughter of the other police officer arrested for Marielle\u2019s murder. As the investigation into Fl\u00e1vio unfolded, the police attempted to interrogate Queiroz about how he could have come into possession of sums of money far in excess of his income as a political aide and former police officer. But after a bizarre television interview in which he vaguely claimed that he had become rich by virtue of his love for \u201cbuying and selling\u201d used cars, Queiroz disappeared completely: hidden in a neighborhood controlled by the same militia that murdered Marielle. The phrase \u201cWhere is Queiroz?\u201d has become a taunting internet meme used to symbolise the criminality at the heart of the Bolsonaro family as well as a protest against the stalled, and perhaps deliberately impeded, police investigation, which to date has arrested no one. Brazil\u2019s largest news magazine, Veja, recently published a cover story announcing that, unlike the Rio police, it had succeeded in \u201cfinding Queiroz\u201d: living in a wealthy neighborhood near Brazil\u2019s most expensive private hospital, where he regularly goes for treatment. Bolsonaro has repeatedly used \u2013 or abused \u2013 his powers as president to block the investigation into the still-mysterious deposits made into the bank account of his eldest son and his wife. The president has all but relinquished his reputation as an anti-corruption crusader with his now-obvious fixation on ensuring that no investigation is permitted to proceed. Bolsonaro has removed officials from the branch of the federal police investigating Fl\u00e1vio and Queiroz. He is threatening to change the leadership of the Rio branch of the federal police and replace them with loyalists to his family. He has stripped the agency that discovered Fl\u00e1vio\u2019s suspicious financial movements of virtually all of its authorities. He appointed as chief prosecutor a man who is openly critical of the anti-corruption investigation that S\u00e9rgio Moro led. And just last month it was reported that Bolsonaro had a meeting in the presidential palace with the lawyer representing Fl\u00e1vio in the corruption investigation. Meanwhile, Bolsonaro\u2019s other son, the city councilman Carlos Bolsonaro, is under investigation for the same kickback scheme of which his older brother is suspected. And Bolsonaro\u2019s attempt to appoint his son Eduardo as Brazil\u2019s ambassador to the US has been widely viewed as corrupt if not an illegal act of nepotism. Bolsonaro\u2019s carefully cultivated image as a political outsider vehemently opposed to corruption was always an obvious myth. He is the opposite of an outsider: before his election as president, he had been a congressman for almost 30 years, closely connected to the Rio de Janeiro political machine. But Bolsonaro\u2019s extremist ideology and his propensity for garnering attention through outlandish statements (such as proclaiming that he would rather learn his son was dead than gay, and explicitly praising the torturers of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship) did relegate him to the fringes of political power in Bras\u00edlia. That is what allowed him to claim the mantle of outsider and frame himself as an adversary of systemic corruption rather than what he seems to be: a direct beneficiary. Any lingering doubts about the legitimacy of this anti-corruption image are being quickly dispelled by his personal involvement in these corruption scandals and his devoted obstruction of all investigations involving himself and his key family members. Just nine months after being inaugurated, polls now show that he is plagued by historic levels of unpopularity for a first-year president. As has happened in so many other countries in the democratic world, including in the US, an \u201coutsider\u201d president elected on promises to \u201cclean up\u201d rampant political corruption has proven even more corrupt than those he denounced. Brazilians have always known that Bolsonaro is a demagogue and extremist. But these scandals and his attempts to keep them concealed are now making it clear to all but his most devoted followers that he is at least as corrupt and friendly to criminal elements, if not himself a criminal, as the scoundrels who have dominated the country\u2019s politics for decades.

Three-and-a-half times more likely, to be precise. The research project, conducted over nearly two years by the University of Glasgow\u2019s Brain Injury Group also discovered a five-fold increase in the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, a four-fold increase in motor neurone disease and a two-fold increase in Parkinson\u2019s.

Frantic efforts by relatives and paramedics had failed to save Jeff, the former West Brom and England legend who, at 54, had first begun to show symptoms of the brain damage that would eventually lead to his death. Diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s, his descent into utter helplessness was swift and before his death five years later he was incontinent, barely able to feed himself and had no idea who he or anyone around him was. In Michael Calvin\u2019s book State of Play, Dawn tells the author that as her father\u2019s body lay in repose she swore an oath on his behalf. \u201cIf football has done this to you, Dad,\u201d she said. \u201cI promise you I\u2019ll make sure the whole world knows and I\u2019ll get justice for you.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/21/landmark-study-reveals-link-between-football-dementia\">Landmark study reveals link between football and dementia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That was in January 2002 and at the initial inquest the coroner, Andrew Haigh, found football had indeed done this to Jeff.

      "bodyText": "The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has queried whether the energy minister, Angus Taylor, has misled parliament in his answers about an altered document that was used to attack the climate record of Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore. Taylor has been under sustained pressure to explain how an altered page of the City of Sydney\u2019s annual report was sent by his office to the Daily Telegraph, which wrote a critical story effectively accusing the lord mayor of being a hypocrite on climate change. The document, which was also quoted in a letter Taylor sent to Moore and the Telegraph, showed spending on travel by councillors in excess of $15m. This was many times the figures that actually appear in the 2017-18 annual report. The issue is continuing to dog the government. At Monday\u2019s council meeting Moore did not mention Taylor or the document but on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 report she said: \u201cWe would have spent most of our time in the air [to achieve those figures]. You would think the minister would have thought, that\u2019s crazy. But he didn\u2019t.\u201d Attending an announcement on energy policy with the prime minister, Taylor again faced questions on the altered document and whether he has apologised to Moore as he said he would on Friday. \u201cI have made a statement and I have said in that statement that I will send her a letter,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything more to add to that today. We\u2019ll be sending the letter this week.\u201d How the numbers came to have been altered has been a matter of furious speculation and questions in parliament. Taylor has admitted the figures were wrong but maintains his office did not forge the council document. The opposition says it is potentially a criminal offence to use a forged document to influence a public official in their duties and has referred the matter to the New South Wales police. The opposition has now submitted three freedom of information requests to Taylor, to his department and to the prime minister\u2019s office asking for documents relating to the altered document as well as talking points that would likely have been produced in the aftermath, after the Guardian broke the story. The requests could also reveal if the prime minister had any prior knowledge of the planned attack on Moore using the Telegraph. The Guardian has also lodged an FOI request, while the Greens and the opposition have combined to require Taylor\u2019s Department of the Environment and Energy to front a Senate estimates committee which will be reconvened in November. Albanese said the latest scandal that has engulfed the energy minister showed he was distracted from the urgent task of reducing Australia\u2019s emissions. \u201cThis is a national energy minister without a national energy policy or framework, who\u2019s distributing documents that he has conceded are fraudulent and not correct to the Daily Telegraph in order to attack a mayor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time the Morrison government got someone as energy minister who can do their day job,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite clearly, minister Taylor isn\u2019t interested in doing that, and how he explains his misleading of parliament last week is beyond my comprehension. \u201cThere\u2019s very serious consequences for that, and he needs to reconcile what he told parliament with what the facts are with regard to this document,\u201d he said.",

After Kyle Fuller picked off Philip Rivers, most of the defense gathered for a delightful performance of the Cha Cha Slide, led by Prince Amukamara. They were having fun, taking comfort in that fact that they are still a dominating force that on Sunday would hold the Chargers to just 231 total yards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BryanDFischer/status/1188507414527504384\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DOINK <a href=\"https://t.co/3d50eocfCv\">pic.twitter.com/3d50eocfCv</a></p>&mdash; Bryan Fischer (@BryanDFischer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BryanDFischer/status/1188507414527504384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 27, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Then the rest of the game happened, and the Bears lost 17-16 when Eddy Pineiro missed a 41-yard field goal as time expired. But this loss, and this season which is officially in disaster mode, was not Pineiro\u2019s fault. Nor was it the fault of a Bears defense which still ranks in the top-10 despite losing disruptive defensive end Akiem Hicks to an elbow injury.</p> <p>Sunday wasn\u2019t the type of signature Bears defensive performance we were treated to every week last season, when the unit consistently terrorized the quarterback and seized every turnover opportunity. But the defense did its part, stymying Melvin Gordon, who only had 31 rushing yards. Khalil Mack also had a nice sack.</p> <p>This game was also a needed change of pace for a defense that had been gashed on the ground in recent weeks because the offense had no ability to keep them off the field with sustained drives. But on Sunday Matt Nagy finally utilized his powerhouse running back, David Montgomery, which kept the defense well rested. For a while, the flow looked like a sliver of last year\u2019s formula. Then the Bears were firmly back in the present.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/25/for-once-tv-caught-the-confusion-and-terror-of-playing-in-the-nfl\">For once, TV caught the confusion and terror of playing in the NFL</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The defense watched as Mitch Trubisky ended the third quarter with an interception and began the fourth with a fumble that the Chargers converted into a touchdown. The defense watched again as Trubisky actually drove Chicago into field-goal range on the final drive leaving enough time to attempt another run, which could have improved the field, position or heck, even led to a score. But Nagy insisted on kicking it right away. <em>Miss. Bears lose again.</em></p> <p>At this point, the Bears owe Mack and Eddie Jackson and Danny Trevathan and the entire defense an apology. Chicago now sit at 3-4 in the cellar of the NFC North without much hope given their quarterback and perplexing playcalling this season. The defense hasn\u2019t been perfect; you\u2019ll hear players like Mack or Trevathan talk about tackles they didn\u2019t perfectly execute or how they still \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dSq8mEZooc\">believe in this team</a>.\u201d But they know the reality. They see the undefeated San Francisco and New England with crushing defenses and must salivate.</p> <p>In case you haven\u2019t heard it before, the Bears selected Trubisky in the 2017 NFL draft ahead of Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson. And yes, instead of watching Trubisky look like a deer in headlines, it\u2019s a fun exercise to close your eyes and dream of Mahomes or Watson paired with this defense.</p> <p>Then reality hits and Bears fans have to watch their team waste a season waiting for Trubisky to make some incremental progress. Meanwhile, the organization is wasting this special collection of defensive talent. Mack is 28 and in his prime. Some guys are older, some are younger. Even with Trubisky\u2019s contract, which some Bears fans are trying to<a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2859120-bears-fan-starts-gofundme-to-buy-out-mitch-trubiskys-contract-after-saints-loss\"> buy out</a>, Chicago\u2019s front office has made the numbers work. That likely won\u2019t be the case starting this offseason.</p> <p>Unless Trubisky makes a massive transformation or the Bears pull off some blockbuster trade before the Tuesday deadline, this team is wasting more than this season. It\u2019s painful to watch. Imagine how Khalil Mack must feel.</p> <h2><strong>Stat of the week</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1188584720185069569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nick Bosa is the first player with 3 sacks and an interception in a single game since the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Chiefs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Chiefs</a> Chris Jones in Week 2 of 2017.<br><br>Bosa is also the first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/49ers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@49ers</a> player to accomplish this feat since sacks became an official stat in 1982. <a href=\"https://t.co/kg1H7rbP04\">pic.twitter.com/kg1H7rbP04</a></p>&mdash; ESPN Stats &amp; Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1188584720185069569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 27, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>A lot of 49ers performed in an electric 51-13 win over the Panthers but no one dominated quite like the rookie Nick Bosa, who has been a beast this season.

      "bodyText": "There was a moment in the first quarter of Sunday\u2019s tilt against the Los Angeles Chargers when the Chicago Bears looked like the Chicago Bears again. After Kyle Fuller picked off Philip Rivers, most of the defense gathered for a delightful performance of the Cha Cha Slide, led by Prince Amukamara. They were having fun, taking comfort in that fact that they are still a dominating force that on Sunday would hold the Chargers to just 231 total yards. Then the rest of the game happened, and the Bears lost 17-16 when Eddy Pineiro missed a 41-yard field goal as time expired. But this loss, and this season which is officially in disaster mode, was not Pineiro\u2019s fault. Nor was it the fault of a Bears defense which still ranks in the top-10 despite losing disruptive defensive end Akiem Hicks to an elbow injury. Sunday wasn\u2019t the type of signature Bears defensive performance we were treated to every week last season, when the unit consistently terrorized the quarterback and seized every turnover opportunity. But the defense did its part, stymying Melvin Gordon, who only had 31 rushing yards. Khalil Mack also had a nice sack. This game was also a needed change of pace for a defense that had been gashed on the ground in recent weeks because the offense had no ability to keep them off the field with sustained drives. But on Sunday Matt Nagy finally utilized his powerhouse running back, David Montgomery, which kept the defense well rested. For a while, the flow looked like a sliver of last year\u2019s formula. Then the Bears were firmly back in the present. The defense watched as Mitch Trubisky ended the third quarter with an interception and began the fourth with a fumble that the Chargers converted into a touchdown. The defense watched again as Trubisky actually drove Chicago into field-goal range on the final drive leaving enough time to attempt another run, which could have improved the field, position or heck, even led to a score. But Nagy insisted on kicking it right away. Miss. Bears lose again. At this point, the Bears owe Mack and Eddie Jackson and Danny Trevathan and the entire defense an apology. Chicago now sit at 3-4 in the cellar of the NFC North without much hope given their quarterback and perplexing playcalling this season. The defense hasn\u2019t been perfect; you\u2019ll hear players like Mack or Trevathan talk about tackles they didn\u2019t perfectly execute or how they still \u201cbelieve in this team.\u201d But they know the reality.

Then reality hits and Bears fans have to watch their team waste a season waiting for Trubisky to make some incremental progress. Meanwhile, the organization is wasting this special collection of defensive talent. Mack is 28 and in his prime. Some guys are older, some are younger.

      "body": "<h2>1) Jeering of Xhaka paints fans in a poor light</h2> \n<p>There can be little doubt that Granit Xhaka has underwhelmed since his big-money move from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach three summers ago, failing to provide either the midfield bite or the drive that has been perennially lacking in Arsenal\u2019s post-Vieira era. He has not, however, lacked effort or interest, no matter how low his performances have dipped and you wonder what exactly those home fans who booed the captain as he left the field in the second half were thinking. Certainly Arsenal\u2019s supporters, who pay through the nose, deserve better and are entitled to vent their frustrations. But to single out an underperforming player for abuse is cruel, toxic and patently self-defeating. Xhaka could be seen mouthing a four-letter response and, for once after an Arsenal implosion, the sympathy should be with the player and not the fans. <strong>Alex Hess</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/27/arsenal-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Arsenal 2-2 Crystal Palace</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/27/granit-xhaka-unai-emery-arsenal-football\">Granit Xhaka\u2019s angry reaction to substitution \u2018was wrong\u2019, says Emery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>2) Chelsea band together to offset Hazard loss</h2> \n<p>Christian Pulisic\u2019s first Chelsea hat-trick promises to reshape the pecking order for the positions on the flanks. \u201cOf course he gives himself a great chance of playing in the games coming up,\u201d said Frank Lampard, but perhaps the most encouraging element is how many appealing attacking options there now are for a team who lost their most productive player. \u201cEveryone wants an Eden Hazard in the team,\u201d Lampard said, but Chelsea have scored 22 goals in their past eight league games without the Belgian. \u201cObviously there is a transition when you lose a player as impactful as Eden. He scored or created nearly 50% of our goals,\u201d Lampard said. But now Tammy Abraham has been directly involved in nine league goals, Mason Mount and Pulisic in five apiece, Willian in four and Marcos Alonso and Callum Hudson-Odoi in three each. There has been a collective commitment to compensate for Hazard\u2019s loss. <strong>Richard Jolly</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/26/burnley-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Burnley 2-4 Chelsea</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>3) Alexander-Arnold\u2019s creative mastery dwarfs any flaws</h2> \n<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold should be renamed Trent Alexander-Bruyne. The quality and range of his passes \u2013 it would be an insult to many of them to call them crosses \u2013 is quite staggering for a 21\u2011year\u2011old, and for much of the game against Spurs he was Liverpool\u2019s biggest threat. It feels a bit churlish, giving the brilliance of his attacking, to acknowledge his occasionally immature defending. But that\u2019s what opposition managers will be doing because it\u2019s the closest thing Liverpool have to a defensive weakness. Most of Spurs\u2019 chances came down Alexander-Arnold\u2019s side, where Son Heung-min was positioned by Mauricio Pochettino. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s positioning and decision-making are sometimes awry. Then again, you can say that of most defenders of his age. If his attacking play didn\u2019t have the poise of a world-class player in his prime, maybe we wouldn\u2019t expect as much of him defensively. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/27/liverpool-tottenham-hotspur-premire-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool 2-1 Tottenham</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10a8f46adb25e49e869d9cf4e28a75ac43745c1e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a8f46adb25e49e869d9cf4e28a75ac43745c1e/0_84_3049_1830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trent Alexander-Arnold and Son Heung-min.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trent Alexander-Arnold and Son Heung-min was a key battle, and one in which the Liverpool defender eventually prevailed.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) Norwich getting drawn towards relegation dogfight</h2> \n<p>Ten games into the season, seven points on the board, and another match when opponents sliced through them, Norwich City look like prime candidates for relegation.

The Austrian\u2019s job now is to pick them up for back-to-back fixtures against Manchester City full in the knowledge that another mauling could cost him his job. No one expects them to get anything from the two games but considering the Saints manager\u2019s acceptance that there was \u201cno fight for anything\u201d on Friday night, so the manner of the performances this week will be all-important: the players will need to prove to the fans that they are committed to the cause, and dogged determination is necessary to get them out of their current hole. Southampton are demoralised from their historic defeat so changes will be made to personnel but Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s real test will be to change the mentality. <strong>Will Unwin</strong> <em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/25/southampton-leicester-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Southampton 0-9 Leicester</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbe4427443db89e2ca1ed0bc4627239673996dff\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbe4427443db89e2ca1ed0bc4627239673996dff/219_386_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl suffered on the sideline as Saints were put to the sword in historic fashion.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Jones/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>9) Pellegrini must rejig side to bring best out of Haller</h2> \n<p>West Ham were right to sell Marko Arnautovic. The Austrian was unreliable, he turned 30 in April and his behaviour left much to be desired before his move to the Chinese Super League last summer. But he was one hell of a player when he was in the mood. Arnautovic\u2019s individual quality was a crucial weapon for West Ham and his replacement, S\u00e9bastien Haller, is struggling to fit in. Haller toiled during this 1-1 draw and the \u00a345m signing is crying out for more support and better service from Felipe Anderson and Andriy Yarmolenko. The 25\u2011year\u2011old is a more traditional target man than Arnautovic, who preferred to run behind defences and create chances for himself, and West Ham need to start playing to Haller\u2019s strengths. The Frenchman has scored once in his past seven games, so Manuel Pellegrini needs to make changes. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> </p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/26/west-ham-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">West Ham 1-1 Sheffield United</a></em></p> \n<h2>10) Flores\u2019s resilient Hornets set stage for Deeney return</h2> \n<p>For a team that haven\u2019t won a league game all season, Watford are in pretty good health. Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores has stabilised the team as promised, with three consecutive draws and only one goal conceded. But their defensive improvement has had a knock-on effect at the other end. They rarely looked like scoring against Bournemouth, despite the highlights-friendly brilliance of Gerard Deulofeu. S\u00e1nchez Flores has preferred a back three \u2013 and, in this match, a fluid strike partnership of Deulofeu and Roberto Pereyra. It\u2019s an intriguing, modern tactic, but it looks better on paper than it did on the pitch on Saturday. Watford are in need of something more old-fashioned: a No 9, a goalscorer and a hero. It\u2019s all set up for Troy Deeney, who should return next month after a knee operation, to ride to the rescue once again. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a

      "bodyText": "1) Jeering of Xhaka paints fans in a poor light There can be little doubt that Granit Xhaka has underwhelmed since his big-money move from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach three summers ago, failing to provide either the midfield bite or the drive that has been perennially lacking in Arsenal\u2019s post-Vieira era. He has not, however, lacked effort or interest, no matter how low his performances have dipped and you wonder what exactly those home fans who booed the captain as he left the field in the second half were thinking. Certainly Arsenal\u2019s supporters, who pay through the nose, deserve better and are entitled to vent their frustrations. But to single out an underperforming player for abuse is cruel, toxic and patently self-defeating. Xhaka could be seen mouthing a four-letter response and, for once after an Arsenal implosion, the sympathy should be with the player and not the fans. Alex Hess \u2022 Match report: Arsenal 2-2 Crystal Palace 2) Chelsea band together to offset Hazard loss Christian Pulisic\u2019s first Chelsea hat-trick promises to reshape the pecking order for the positions on the flanks. \u201cOf course he gives himself a great chance of playing in the games coming up,\u201d said Frank Lampard, but perhaps the most encouraging element is how many appealing attacking options there now are for a team who lost their most productive player. \u201cEveryone wants an Eden Hazard in the team,\u201d Lampard said, but Chelsea have scored 22 goals in their past eight league games without the Belgian. \u201cObviously there is a transition when you lose a player as impactful as Eden. He scored or created nearly 50% of our goals,\u201d Lampard said. But now Tammy Abraham has been directly involved in nine league goals, Mason Mount and Pulisic in five apiece, Willian in four and Marcos Alonso and Callum Hudson-Odoi in three each. There has been a collective commitment to compensate for Hazard\u2019s loss. Richard Jolly \u2022 Match report: Burnley 2-4 Chelsea 3) Alexander-Arnold\u2019s creative mastery dwarfs any flaws Trent Alexander-Arnold should be renamed Trent Alexander-Bruyne. The quality and range of his passes \u2013 it would be an insult to many of them to call them crosses \u2013 is quite staggering for a 21\u2011year\u2011old, and for much of the game against Spurs he was Liverpool\u2019s biggest threat. It feels a bit churlish, giving the brilliance of his attacking, to acknowledge his occasionally immature defending. But that\u2019s what opposition managers will be doing because it\u2019s the closest thing Liverpool have to a defensive weakness. Most of Spurs\u2019 chances came down Alexander-Arnold\u2019s side, where Son Heung-min was positioned by Mauricio Pochettino. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s positioning and decision-making are sometimes awry. Then again, you can say that of most defenders of his age. If his attacking play didn\u2019t have the poise of a world-class player in his prime, maybe we wouldn\u2019t expect as much of him defensively. Rob Smyth \u2022 Match report: Liverpool 2-1 Tottenham 4) Norwich getting drawn towards relegation dogfight Ten games into the season, seven points on the board, and another match when opponents sliced through them, Norwich City look like prime candidates for relegation.

Pep Guardiola pointed to how he guided Barcelona to Champions League final triumph over Manchester United in 2009 as the inspiration to overcome the defensive crisis. \u201cMy first Champions League final, we had a back four with three injuries to the normal starters: against Cristiano [Ronaldo], [Ryan] Giggs, one of the best squads I ever faced in my career. I prefer to have Laporte, but today [against Aston Villa] John Stones played incredibly well apart from one or two actions and we were solid defensively. We have the players [we have], so OK: we go with them. That is the best way.\u201d Jamie Jackson \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 3-0 Aston Villa 6) Holgate convinced Toffees\u2019 luck will turn The unlucky defeat at Brighton \u2013 Everton\u2019s sixth loss in 10 Premier League matches this season \u2013 did nothing to help Marco Silva win over the club\u2019s fans who say he is not the manager to take them forward. But Mason Holgate, who played well on his first top-flight start for the club in more than a year, says the players remain right behind him. \u201cI think that\u2019s showed in the last two performances we\u2019ve put out. Last week [in the 2-0 win against West Ham] we were all unbelievable and then this week we were doing really well and there was a [VAR] decision that just completely put the game on its head.\u201d Graham Potter reckoned Everton\u2019s performance suggested Holgate\u2019s words were not platitudes. \u201cThey had great intensity and structure and a great work ethic. I\u2019m pretty sure that if they maintain that level they\u2019ve had in the last two games they\u2019ll pick points up.\u201d Paul Doyle \u2022 Match report: Brighton 3-2 Everton 7) Joelinton a symbol of Newcastle mismanagement By finally bringing the best out in Adama Traor\u00e9, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s second-half switch from 3-5-2 to 3-4-3 paved the way for his side\u2019s comeback from a goal down to claim a point. But, and it is a big but, it should have been academic. Had Newcastle possessed an effective centre\u2011forward they would surely have had the game all but won by the interval. Joelinton cost \u00a340m from Hoffenheim but the 23-year-old Brazilian striker \u2013 deployed in a left-sided attacking role in Germany where he was never a prolific scorer \u2013 is struggling badly and, failing to hold the ball up, emphasising why Steve Bruce\u2019s predecessor, Rafael Ben\u00edtez was so desperate to sign Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n permanently from West Brom. Instead Newcastle\u2019s hierarchy said Rond\u00f3n was too old so both he and Ben\u00edtez are now in China. If only Mike Ashley had listened. Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Newcastle 1-1 Wolves 8) Hasenh\u00fcttl faces a week of reckoning It was noble of Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl to take responsibility for the 9-0 defeat against Leicester when really his players laid down and accepted their humiliation. The Austrian\u2019s job now is to pick them up for back-to-back fixtures against Manchester City full in the knowledge that another mauling could cost him his job. No one expects them to get anything from the two games but considering the Saints manager\u2019s acceptance that there was \u201cno fight for anything\u201d on Friday night, so the manner of the performances this week will be all-important: the players will need to prove to the fans that they are committed to the cause, and dogged determination is necessary to get them out of their current hole. Southampton are demoralised from their historic defeat so changes will be made to personnel but Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s real test will be to change the mentality. Will Unwin \u2022 Match report: Southampton 0-9 Leicester 9) Pellegrini must rejig side to bring best out of Haller West Ham were right to sell Marko Arnautovic. The Austrian was unreliable, he turned 30 in April and his behaviour left much to be desired before his move to the Chinese Super League last summer. But he was one hell of a player when he was in the mood. Arnautovic\u2019s individual quality was a crucial weapon for West Ham and his replacement, S\u00e9bastien Haller, is struggling to fit in. Haller toiled during this 1-1 draw and the \u00a345m signing is crying out for more support and better service from Felipe Anderson and Andriy Yarmolenko. The 25\u2011year\u2011old is a more traditional target man than Arnautovic, who preferred to run behind defences and create chances for himself, and West Ham need to start playing to Haller\u2019s strengths. The Frenchman has scored once in his past seven games, so Manuel Pellegrini needs to make changes. Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: West Ham 1-1 Sheffield United 10) Flores\u2019s resilient Hornets set stage for Deeney return For a team that haven\u2019t won a league game all season, Watford are in pretty good health. Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores has stabilised the team as promised, with three consecutive draws and only one goal conceded. But their defensive improvement has had a knock-on effect at the other end. They rarely looked like scoring against Bournemouth, despite the highlights-friendly brilliance of Gerard Deulofeu. S\u00e1nchez Flores has preferred a back three \u2013 and, in this match, a fluid strike partnership of Deulofeu and Roberto Pereyra. It\u2019s an intriguing, modern tactic, but it looks better on paper than it did on the pitch on Saturday. Watford are in need of something more old-fashioned: a No 9, a goalscorer and a hero. It\u2019s all set up for Troy Deeney, who should return next month after a knee operation, to ride to the rescue once again. Rob Smyth \u2022 Match report: Watford 0-0 Bournemouth",

      "body": "<p>Most teenagers want to leave home to experience their first taste of independence. I just wanted to move to a place where the door didn\u2019t go \u201cding\u201d every time someone walked through it.</p> <p>We moved to Coventry in the early 80s, when I was just coming up to my teens and the new-romantic movement was at its peak. Back then, it was enough of a concern trying to get my hair to flick right, so when we ended up living in a Chinese takeaway I panicked about the grease wilting my fringe. Little did I know that was to be the least of my worries.</p> <p>My parents and grandparents had emigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1960s. They were part of a postwar wave that had begun in the 1950s, of people arriving in Britain to work in a growing industry: Chinese food. It was affordable, exotic and suddenly very popular in the west. When we arrived in Coventry, we had already lived in Nottingham and Hull, but this converted two-up two-down terrace house was where we would stay.</p> <p>It was only recently that I found out the majority of Hong Kong immigrants who came over to work in restaurants and takeaways did the same, as it was the cheapest and most convenient form of accommodation. The downside was that they were trapped inside the building all day, with hardly any opportunities to socialise with the wider community. It was especially difficult for people like my mother, who was essentially uneducated (she left school at 13), because it severely limited the pool of other jobs she could do. Dad\u2019s frustration manifested as frequent bouts of short temper, and both of them turned to casinos as an escape because they were the only form of after-hours entertainment available, which is probably one of the reasons there often seem to be a lot of Chinese people in casinos. No wonder they were, and still often are, known as the \u201csilent minority\u201d.</p> <p>But, as I say, I didn\u2019t know that then. All I knew was that the ground floor of our home was taken up by the shop and extended kitchen. We made up for not having a living room by cramming an old sofa into my parents\u2019 bedroom, alongside a table with a TV plonked on top. I remember spending hours poring over living-room pictures in the Argos catalogue, imagining a better life involving cornicing and pelmets.</p> <p>My sister and I were squashed into the other bedroom, which provided the only access to the bathroom. There was absolutely no privacy, so I missed out on doing all sorts of formative stuff, such as snogging poster pinups, for fear that someone would barge in at any second, desperate for a poo.</p> <p>Another challenge was that, even though our kitchen was industrial-sized, we couldn\u2019t fit in a washing machine, which meant I had to go to the launderette every weekend because Mum was too busy frying pork balls. At senior school, I heard someone say to his mate: \u201cUgh, I can smell soy sauce,\u201d while they both sneered at me, so I was paranoid about cooking odours clinging to my clothes. But no matter how much detergent I chucked in, our laundry always seemed to come out with an undertone of chicken chop suey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca0e24ba6d75e22f1e068a2216785b860e0741e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca0e24ba6d75e22f1e068a2216785b860e0741e7/0_0_5333_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sue Cheung with her older brother and little sister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sue Cheung with her older brother and little sister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Sue Cheung</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I would have liked to talk to my parents about my troubles, but I couldn\u2019t because my Chinese was dire. For some reason, our parents never taught us how to speak our native language (although I do understand the odd phrase, such as \u201cCome and gut these prawns!\u201d and \u201cOne day you\u2019ll inherit this takeaway!\u201d). To complicate things further, my parents, who did speak Cantonese \u2013 the dialect most British Chinese people use \u2013 chose to speak Hakka at home, so the kids couldn\u2019t communicate at all with extended family and friends, who would ridicule us for it. Add to that the fact that Mum hardly spoke English, Dad spoke good English, but didn\u2019t like talking, and that my grandparents spoke no English at all, and you have a pretty sorry state of affairs.</p> <p>Random funny fact: mashed potato never existed for Chinese people before they came to Britain, so they didn\u2019t have a word for it. They decided to call it by its English name, \u201cmash\u201d, but pronounced it \u201cma-see\u201d. This, translated back into Hakka, means \u201chorse shit\u201d, which I\u2019ve always found hysterical because I\u2019m so infantile.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure why Chinese people bothered naming mash because they never eat it. When our grandparents attempted to make western food, we got spaghetti with golden syrup, and margarine and sugar sandwiches. Mum never made western food, and she never let us eat the food we served customers either because she said it had no nutritional value. Instead, we ate \u201cproper\u201d Chinese food, which consisted of bland steamed fish and vegetables, and sometimes chicken\u2019s feet. My views on food became so skewed that one year I thought it would be honourable of me to donate a catering tin of bamboo shoots to the harvest festival at school. It wasn\u2019t until it was on display in assembly that I realised how out of place it looked next to the custard creams and baked beans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4061b8e6c55978b1c48cf791d3645d27e5e162a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4061b8e6c55978b1c48cf791d3645d27e5e162a/0_0_5333_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With her baby brother Richard and their dog, Lucky.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her baby brother Richard and their dog, Lucky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Sue Cheung</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After-school activities included bagging prawn crackers, chopping mushrooms and peeling prawns. Contrary to the \u201ctiger parenting\u201d now associated with Chinese child-rearing, all my parents wanted was for me to take over the business when they retired. I know they meant well, but I couldn\u2019t think of anything worse than working 12-hour days with only Christmas Day off. So, instead of getting a pat on the back for top marks in art, I got a slap round the head for slicing the char siu all wrong. Once, I ended up chopping the end of my index finger off with a meat cleaver, which in hindsight probably required a trip to the hospital for stitches. But my parents didn\u2019t believe in western medicine, and they just doused the wound with soy sauce and wrapped it up in a dishcloth.</p> <p>When I grew tall enough, aged 14, to see over the counter \u2013 just under 5ft (FYI, I\u2019m still that height) \u2013 I had to start serving customers, and I hated it. Friday and Saturday nights were the worst, as that was when punters came in steaming from the pub. \u201cHow long\u2019s it gonna be?\u201d they would slur, jabbing at their watches as if they thought I needed a visual prompt. \u201cAbout this long,\u201d I\u2019d say, indicating the length of the container it would come in. Then they would crack up and think they\u2019d made a funny little Asian friend. I soon learned how to deal with them, by giving as good as I got.</p> <p>Occasionally, a fight would break out and I\u2019d have to call the police because I was the only one who could speak good enough English. Once, a bloke started being racist to Mum, and my uncle \u2013 who was helping out \u2013 vaulted over the counter with a knife, Bruce Lee style, and chased him down the street while the whole neighbourhood watched. But all I could think was how embarrassing my family were and how much more bullied I would be if anyone at school found out.</p> <p>I\u2019d been picked on all my life, though, so it was nothing new. At infant school, I was the only Chinese kid, and bullies would pull their eyes into slits at me and sing the Ching Chong Chinaman song. I used to go home, look in the mirror and think: \u201cBut my eyes are oval-shaped,\u201d then get confused. By the time I went to secondary school, there were three other Chinese students: my older brother, my cousin and a boy I didn\u2019t know. Takeaways and restaurants tend to be scattered about in different towns to avoid competition. The result is that we stand out wherever we go.</p> <p>Despite my growing insecurities, I managed to make a friend (let\u2019s call her Tina). Tina was interested in meeting my family, but I was insistent that this would never happen. At the same time, I wanted to appear like any other \u201cnormal\u201d teenager who invites friends over in a \u201cnormal\u201d way, so I caved in.

      "bodyText": "Most teenagers want to leave home to experience their first taste of independence. I just wanted to move to a place where the door didn\u2019t go \u201cding\u201d every time someone walked through it. We moved to Coventry in the early 80s, when I was just coming up to my teens and the new-romantic movement was at its peak. Back then, it was enough of a concern trying to get my hair to flick right, so when we ended up living in a Chinese takeaway I panicked about the grease wilting my fringe. Little did I know that was to be the least of my worries. My parents and grandparents had emigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1960s. They were part of a postwar wave that had begun in the 1950s, of people arriving in Britain to work in a growing industry: Chinese food. It was affordable, exotic and suddenly very popular in the west. When we arrived in Coventry, we had already lived in Nottingham and Hull, but this converted two-up two-down terrace house was where we would stay. It was only recently that I found out the majority of Hong Kong immigrants who came over to work in restaurants and takeaways did the same, as it was the cheapest and most convenient form of accommodation. The downside was that they were trapped inside the building all day, with hardly any opportunities to socialise with the wider community. It was especially difficult for people like my mother, who was essentially uneducated (she left school at 13), because it severely limited the pool of other jobs she could do. Dad\u2019s frustration manifested as frequent bouts of short temper, and both of them turned to casinos as an escape because they were the only form of after-hours entertainment available, which is probably one of the reasons there often seem to be a lot of Chinese people in casinos. No wonder they were, and still often are, known as the \u201csilent minority\u201d. But, as I say, I didn\u2019t know that then. All I knew was that the ground floor of our home was taken up by the shop and extended kitchen. We made up for not having a living room by cramming an old sofa into my parents\u2019 bedroom, alongside a table with a TV plonked on top. I remember spending hours poring over living-room pictures in the Argos catalogue, imagining a better life involving cornicing and pelmets. My sister and I were squashed into the other bedroom, which provided the only access to the bathroom. There was absolutely no privacy, so I missed out on doing all sorts of formative stuff, such as snogging poster pinups, for fear that someone would barge in at any second, desperate for a poo. Another challenge was that, even though our kitchen was industrial-sized, we couldn\u2019t fit in a washing machine, which meant I had to go to the launderette every weekend because Mum was too busy frying pork balls. At senior school, I heard someone say to his mate: \u201cUgh, I can smell soy sauce,\u201d while they both sneered at me, so I was paranoid about cooking odours clinging to my clothes. But no matter how much detergent I chucked in, our laundry always seemed to come out with an undertone of chicken chop suey. I would have liked to talk to my parents about my troubles, but I couldn\u2019t because my Chinese was dire. For some reason, our parents never taught us how to speak our native language (although I do understand the odd phrase, such as \u201cCome and gut these prawns!\u201d and \u201cOne day you\u2019ll inherit this takeaway!\u201d). To complicate things further, my parents, who did speak Cantonese \u2013 the dialect most British Chinese people use \u2013 chose to speak Hakka at home, so the kids couldn\u2019t communicate at all with extended family and friends, who would ridicule us for it. Add to that the fact that Mum hardly spoke English, Dad spoke good English, but didn\u2019t like talking, and that my grandparents spoke no English at all, and you have a pretty sorry state of affairs. Random funny fact: mashed potato never existed for Chinese people before they came to Britain, so they didn\u2019t have a word for it. They decided to call it by its English name, \u201cmash\u201d, but pronounced it \u201cma-see\u201d. This, translated back into Hakka, means \u201chorse shit\u201d, which I\u2019ve always found hysterical because I\u2019m so infantile. I\u2019m not sure why Chinese people bothered naming mash because they never eat it. When our grandparents attempted to make western food, we got spaghetti with golden syrup, and margarine and sugar sandwiches. Mum never made western food, and she never let us eat the food we served customers either because she said it had no nutritional value. Instead, we ate \u201cproper\u201d Chinese food, which consisted of bland steamed fish and vegetables, and sometimes chicken\u2019s feet. My views on food became so skewed that one year I thought it would be honourable of me to donate a catering tin of bamboo shoots to the harvest festival at school. It wasn\u2019t until it was on display in assembly that I realised how out of place it looked next to the custard creams and baked beans. After-school activities included bagging prawn crackers, chopping mushrooms and peeling prawns. Contrary to the \u201ctiger parenting\u201d now associated with Chinese child-rearing, all my parents wanted was for me to take over the business when they retired. I know they meant well, but I couldn\u2019t think of anything worse than working 12-hour days with only Christmas Day off. So, instead of getting a pat on the back for top marks in art, I got a slap round the head for slicing the char siu all wrong. Once, I ended up chopping the end of my index finger off with a meat cleaver, which in hindsight probably required a trip to the hospital for stitches. But my parents didn\u2019t believe in western medicine, and they just doused the wound with soy sauce and wrapped it up in a dishcloth. When I grew tall enough, aged 14, to see over the counter \u2013 just under 5ft (FYI, I\u2019m still that height) \u2013 I had to start serving customers, and I hated it. Friday and Saturday nights were the worst, as that was when punters came in steaming from the pub. \u201cHow long\u2019s it gonna be?\u201d they would slur, jabbing at their watches as if they thought I needed a visual prompt. \u201cAbout this long,\u201d I\u2019d say, indicating the length of the container it would come in. Then they would crack up and think they\u2019d made a funny little Asian friend. I soon learned how to deal with them, by giving as good as I got. Occasionally, a fight would break out and I\u2019d have to call the police because I was the only one who could speak good enough English. Once, a bloke started being racist to Mum, and my uncle \u2013 who was helping out \u2013 vaulted over the counter with a knife, Bruce Lee style, and chased him down the street while the whole neighbourhood watched. But all I could think was how embarrassing my family were and how much more bullied I would be if anyone at school found out. I\u2019d been picked on all my life, though, so it was nothing new. At infant school, I was the only Chinese kid, and bullies would pull their eyes into slits at me and sing the Ching Chong Chinaman song. I used to go home, look in the mirror and think: \u201cBut my eyes are oval-shaped,\u201d then get confused. By the time I went to secondary school, there were three other Chinese students: my older brother, my cousin and a boy I didn\u2019t know. Takeaways and restaurants tend to be scattered about in different towns to avoid competition. The result is that we stand out wherever we go. Despite my growing insecurities, I managed to make a friend (let\u2019s call her Tina). Tina was interested in meeting my family, but I was insistent that this would never happen. At the same time, I wanted to appear like any other \u201cnormal\u201d teenager who invites friends over in a \u201cnormal\u201d way, so I caved in. She had cornrows in her hair at the time, and as soon as she walked into the kitchen, Mum pointed at her and laughed because she thought Tina looked like an onion. Tina in turn thought this was the funniest thing she\u2019d ever heard, and in her mind it made me the coolest mate she had ever had. Good job Tina wasn\u2019t normal either. As if running a takeaway wasn\u2019t stressful enough, Dad decided we should keep pets. The first was a fully grown alsatian called Lucky, who seemed to appear from nowhere. We didn\u2019t know how to train her, so she kept escaping on to the main road and nearly getting run over (not so Lucky). Finally, she was given away to the man who delivered the beansprouts. Next up were two goats that Dad gave piggybacks to, up and down the garden (he was a bit eccentric). They were doted over, and allowed to roam wherever they wanted. But one day the brown goat got caught eating \u00a320 worth of fivers out of the till and was sent off to live with Beansprout Man as punishment. Later, the black one broke into the shed, ate a whole bag of hops and exploded. I won\u2019t even go into what happened to my little sister\u2019s hamster. As soon as I was able, I left home and went to London with grand ideas of becoming an artist \u2013 which, perhaps unsurprisingly, wasn\u2019t plain sailing. It took a long time to adjust to life outside a Chinese takeaway, especially as I didn\u2019t have a clue about boys, booze or contraception. At the age of 19, I ended up pregnant and living in a King\u2019s Cross squat. Twenty five years later, living happily in a house with a living room \u2013 and cornicing \u2013 I was asked by my agent whether I would consider a book about my childhood. I was horrified.

The others are the Marshall Islands and Papua New Guinea.</p> <p>By comparison, Estonia gives women 85 weeks at full pay for maternity leave, while the UK, found by<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/13/parental-leave-uk-among-least-family-friendly-countries-oecd-survey\">Unicef</a> to be one of the least family-friendly of the world\u2019s richest countries, offers maternity leave for the equivalent of 12 weeks full pay.</p> <p>But after years of inaction in the US, national conversation around the issue of paid family leave \u2013 which can include childbirth, serious illness and caring for a sick family member \u2013 has started to gain political ground. Eight states and the District of Columbia have passed their own paid family leave bills \u2013 four of which have already implemented it.</p> <p>On the national stage, it looks set to become an important policy point in the 2020 US election.<strong> </strong>Most of the Democratic presidential contenders support paid family leave and, for the first time, many Republicans are taking an interest in paid parental leave \u2013 including Donald Trump, who called for six weeks\u2019 paid leave for new parents in his last budget.</p> <p>Ruth Martin, vice-president of workplace justice campaigns at MomsRising, said this progress is partly down to the recent influx of female representation in the House and Senate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2019/jun/18/paid-vacation-leave-us-datablog\">No rest for the workers: how the US is out of step on paid leave</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that we\u2019ve seen the most momentum at the congressional level this year, right after we had the historic [2018] midterm election with a lot more women and moms elected in office. So we\u2019re really getting close to a point where we\u2019re going to continue to see a real increase in getting close to passing a national policy.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The only national family leave legislation currently in place in the US is the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), signed into law by former president Bill Clinton in 1993 under which eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year for birth, adoption, medical leave or to care for a sick family member.</p> <p>But like about 40% of Americans who, according to the National Partnership of Women &amp; Families do not meet the act\u2019s various restrictions, Nicholson did not qualify (at under 50 employees, her company was too small).</p> <p>Even if she had qualified, with rent, household bills, car payments and medical bills to pay, taking unpaid time off was not an option. \u201cWe would not have been able to keep a roof over our heads \u2026 I just can\u2019t even imagine not having an extra dual income at that time, we would be in financial ruin still, I think.\u201d</p> <p>For most Americans, pregnancy or long-term sickness mean either going to work at times when they are not mentally or physically equipped to do so, or going without pay and potentially losing a job.</p> <p>\u201cFor me it\u2019s a simple thing,\u201d said Ellen Bravo, co-Director of Family Values @ Work. \u201cIf you value families then you have to make it possible for people to do exactly what we say we care most about, being responsible family members, following doctors\u2019 orders, we have to make it possible for people to do that without falling off an economic cliff.\u201d</p> <p>Bravo, who has been campaigning for paid family leave since the early 80s, said those in the highest-paid jobs are most likely to have access to paid leave or a \u201cfinancial cushion\u201d but it\u2019s an issue that spans the economic spectrum, from middle-class employees to the lowest-paid workers.</p> <p>According to US Department of Labor <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2019/access-to-paid-and-unpaid-family-leave-in-2018.htm\">statistics</a>, only 17% of civilian workers had access to paid family leave in March 2018. Just 40% had <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ebs2.pdf\">access</a> to short-term disability insurance.</p> <p>\u201cClearly it has a disparate impact on people who are in the lowest-paid jobs and those are disproportionately people of colour,\u201d said Bravo.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I know how much further along we would have been in life had there been policies with paid family leave</p> <footer> <cite>Tameka Henry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The absence of paid leave and the resulting pressure on families to not take time off work, she said, leads to babies being left alone in neonatal intensive care units, new mothers going back to work before they have healed and people being forced to leave their partners alone on their deathbeds. With new babies it can also impact breastfeeding, bonding and vaccinations.</p> <p>As a sole carer and the only earner in her five-person household, Tameka Henry, 42, from Las Vegas, regularly has to choose between taking unpaid leave to look after her chronically ill husband, Abdul Smith, 45, or going to work so she can pay the bills.<br><br>She works two jobs \u2013 as an assistant market coordinator for a community garden and as an after-school program instructor \u2013 but it\u2019s still a struggle to make ends meet and she worries about taking time off for hospital visits and caring for her children.<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re forced to make that decision. Do I be there for my family member? Or do I go to work so I can make the income to make our bills, or to be able to support some of the medications that are not covered completely under a plan? And it\u2019s like, what do you do?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI get emotional about this because I know how much further along we would have been in life had there been policies with paid family leave. I know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Paid family leave has broad support from voters. According to <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/03/23/support-for-paid-leave-policies/\">2017 research by Pew</a>, 82% of Americans say mothers should receive paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child and 69% support it for fathers.</p> <p>Kevin Denny II, a developer living in San Antonio, Texas, was shocked to find that he is not entitled to any paid time off after his second child is born in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c33ad075ad678397c60a80de63c818e6690b018b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c33ad075ad678397c60a80de63c818e6690b018b/0_223_1459_1823/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s becoming less taboo of course, but it\u2019s still, depending on where you\u2019re at, a taboo thing,\u2019 said Kevin Denny II.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s becoming less taboo of course, but it\u2019s still, depending on where you\u2019re at, a taboo thing,\u2019 said Kevin Denny II.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Denny II</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Denny, 35, who already has a one-year-old son, KJ, with his wife, Jamie, said paid family leave is still unthinkable for some. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming less taboo of course, but it\u2019s still, depending on where you\u2019re at, a taboo thing. Like, paid family leave, what is that?\u201d</p> <p>He is not alone. Andrea Zuniga, vice-president of legislative affairs at Paid Leave for the United States (PL+US) said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, particularly with millennial men, more and more of them want to play a very active role in their child\u2019s life and be there during those formative years, take that time off.\u201d</p> <p>With its broad appeal, Zuniga is encouraging all candidates, Democrat and Republican, to talk about paid leave.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an issue that crosses partisan lines. It is something that really connects with people.\u201d</p> <p>But voters are split on how to pay for it.

      "bodyText": "Like millions of new mothers across America, MacKenzie Nicholson was faced with an impossible situation. Her doctor had recommended she take at least six weeks off work after giving birth by C-section, to recover her health and bond with her newborn. Should she follow medical advice and risk losing her home, or return to work? Just five weeks after giving birth to her second child, she was back in the office, her body still in agony from nerve damage after surgery, and her tiny baby in tow. How did she keep it together? \u201cI mean the reality is we didn\u2019t,\u201d said Nicholson, 29, who works for a not-for-profit and lives with her husband Philip, 38, and their two children Lucas, six, and Quinn, two, in Nottingham, New Hampshire. \u201cI was sick to my stomach all the time, feeling stressed about the work-life balance, definitely had postpartum depression, and I don\u2019t know whether one thing leads into the other but I assume that it does and it was hard.\u201d By American standards, however, Nicholson was comparatively lucky. The US is one of the world\u2019s richest countries, but one in four women go back to work within 10 days of giving birth, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Nicholson\u2019s former workplace \u2013 she now works for another not-for-profit as a grassroots manager \u2013 looked like a creche for a while, complete with a cot and rocker, and she had to take Quinn with her to work appointments. \u201cI look back at the times and it should be a happy memory, it\u2019s more of like a \u2018I can\u2019t believe we did that and made it through and we\u2019re surviving, we\u2019re still standing\u2019. That was one of the toughest times of my life, if not the toughest time of my life.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 The US is one of only three countries in the world not to offer statutory paid maternity leave, according to analysis by the International Labour Organization. The others are the Marshall Islands and Papua New Guinea. By comparison, Estonia gives women 85 weeks at full pay for maternity leave, while the UK, found by Unicef to be one of the least family-friendly of the world\u2019s richest countries, offers maternity leave for the equivalent of 12 weeks full pay. But after years of inaction in the US, national conversation around the issue of paid family leave \u2013 which can include childbirth, serious illness and caring for a sick family member \u2013 has started to gain political ground. Eight states and the District of Columbia have passed their own paid family leave bills \u2013 four of which have already implemented it. On the national stage, it looks set to become an important policy point in the 2020 US election. Most of the Democratic presidential contenders support paid family leave and, for the first time, many Republicans are taking an interest in paid parental leave \u2013 including Donald Trump, who called for six weeks\u2019 paid leave for new parents in his last budget. Ruth Martin, vice-president of workplace justice campaigns at MomsRising, said this progress is partly down to the recent influx of female representation in the House and Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that we\u2019ve seen the most momentum at the congressional level this year, right after we had the historic [2018] midterm election with a lot more women and moms elected in office. So we\u2019re really getting close to a point where we\u2019re going to continue to see a real increase in getting close to passing a national policy.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 The only national family leave legislation currently in place in the US is the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), signed into law by former president Bill Clinton in 1993 under which eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year for birth, adoption, medical leave or to care for a sick family member. But like about 40% of Americans who, according to the National Partnership of Women &amp; Families do not meet the act\u2019s various restrictions, Nicholson did not qualify (at under 50 employees, her company was too small). Even if she had qualified, with rent, household bills, car payments and medical bills to pay, taking unpaid time off was not an option. \u201cWe would not have been able to keep a roof over our heads \u2026 I just can\u2019t even imagine not having an extra dual income at that time, we would be in financial ruin still, I think.\u201d For most Americans, pregnancy or long-term sickness mean either going to work at times when they are not mentally or physically equipped to do so, or going without pay and potentially losing a job. \u201cFor me it\u2019s a simple thing,\u201d said Ellen Bravo, co-Director of Family Values @ Work. \u201cIf you value families then you have to make it possible for people to do exactly what we say we care most about, being responsible family members, following doctors\u2019 orders, we have to make it possible for people to do that without falling off an economic cliff.\u201d Bravo, who has been campaigning for paid family leave since the early 80s, said those in the highest-paid jobs are most likely to have access to paid leave or a \u201cfinancial cushion\u201d but it\u2019s an issue that spans the economic spectrum, from middle-class employees to the lowest-paid workers. According to US Department of Labor statistics, only 17% of civilian workers had access to paid family leave in March 2018. Just 40% had access to short-term disability insurance. \u201cClearly it has a disparate impact on people who are in the lowest-paid jobs and those are disproportionately people of colour,\u201d said Bravo. The absence of paid leave and the resulting pressure on families to not take time off work, she said, leads to babies being left alone in neonatal intensive care units, new mothers going back to work before they have healed and people being forced to leave their partners alone on their deathbeds. With new babies it can also impact breastfeeding, bonding and vaccinations. As a sole carer and the only earner in her five-person household, Tameka Henry, 42, from Las Vegas, regularly has to choose between taking unpaid leave to look after her chronically ill husband, Abdul Smith, 45, or going to work so she can pay the bills. She works two jobs \u2013 as an assistant market coordinator for a community garden and as an after-school program instructor \u2013 but it\u2019s still a struggle to make ends meet and she worries about taking time off for hospital visits and caring for her children. \u201cYou\u2019re forced to make that decision. Do I be there for my family member? Or do I go to work so I can make the income to make our bills, or to be able to support some of the medications that are not covered completely under a plan? And it\u2019s like, what do you do?\u201d she said. \u201cI get emotional about this because I know how much further along we would have been in life had there been policies with paid family leave. I know that.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Paid family leave has broad support from voters. According to 2017 research by Pew, 82% of Americans say mothers should receive paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child and 69% support it for fathers. Kevin Denny II, a developer living in San Antonio, Texas, was shocked to find that he is not entitled to any paid time off after his second child is born in November. Denny, 35, who already has a one-year-old son, KJ, with his wife, Jamie, said paid family leave is still unthinkable for some. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming less taboo of course, but it\u2019s still, depending on where you\u2019re at, a taboo thing. Like, paid family leave, what is that?\u201d He is not alone. Andrea Zuniga, vice-president of legislative affairs at Paid Leave for the United States (PL+US) said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, particularly with millennial men, more and more of them want to play a very active role in their child\u2019s life and be there during those formative years, take that time off.\u201d With its broad appeal, Zuniga is encouraging all candidates, Democrat and Republican, to talk about paid leave. \u201cThis is an issue that crosses partisan lines. It is something that really connects with people.\u201d But voters are split on how to pay for it. According to Pew, 51% said employers should be mandated to pay workers for family leave, while 48% said employers should be left to make their own decision. To date, California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New York, Washington state, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon and the District of Columbia have all passed their own paid family leave laws. Meanwhile, businesses such as Walmart \u2013 the largest employer in the US \u2013 and Target now offer their own schemes. In Tucson, Arizona, the elementary school teacher Julie Groce said she believes all government workers should be entitled to the kinds of maternity benefits available in the private sector. Groce did not qualify for short-term disability insurance, so she had to use holiday and sick time for part of her maternity leave. The current system, she said, relies on there being two working parents. Not receiving paid parental leave put Groce, 35, and her husband Kris, 41, who works in IT, under financial strain after the birth of their now one-year-old son, Adam. \u201cWhy should a mother be punished for producing offspring?\u201d she said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a partner, there\u2019s no way \u2026 My paycheck alone would not have been able to afford a child.\u201d Now that the concept has bipartisan support, what\u2019s stopping Congress? The New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who reintroduced the Family Act with the Connecticut representative Rosa DeLauro in February, is convinced the momentum is finally with them. \u201cWe have not only President Trump advocating for paid family leave, we have Republicans who have paid leave plans,\u201d Gillibrand said. \u201cMost of the plans that Republicans have put forward so far are inadequate because they\u2019re not for all life events, they\u2019re just for babies.

This month the New Jersey representative Chris Smith became the first Republican to sign on and Gillibrand said she is \u201cconfident we will get even more Republican co-sponsors in the months ahead\u201d. But the Family Act is not the only option on the table. Republican proposals include the Florida senator Marco Rubio\u2019s New Parents Act, co-sponsored by fellow Republican senator Mitt Romney. Rubio does not support raising taxes to pay for paid federal leave; instead his proposal would give parents a voluntary option to use some of their social security \u2013 usually used for retirement and disability \u2013 as payment during leave after birth or adoption.

      "body": "<p>The government is likely to accept a Lib Dem plan to force a general election via legislation if, as expected, a new Brexit delay is agreed, the party\u2019s leader, Jo Swinson, has predicted.</p> <p>While the government remains officially focused on calling an election through a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA), this would need a two-thirds majority and a third attempt at this route appears destined to fail when MPs vote on Monday afternoon, with Labour set to abstain.</p> <p>If it does not pass, Swinson said she expected Boris Johnson\u2019s government to get behind a joint Lib Dem and Scottish National party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/26/boris-johnson-no-brexit-until-january-block-christmas-general-election\">plan to call an election</a> in December by simply amending the FTPA, which would require a standard majority.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Swinson told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cThis bill is one that we have drafted. It ties the prime minister\u2019s hands about the date of the election. It sets it in law, so it doesn\u2019t give him the wriggle room that his plan would have.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from behind the scenes, but I have written to him this morning, so I will hope to get a response this morning.\u201d</p> <p>When the idea for the bill-based election was first revealed on Sunday, Johnson\u2019s ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/27/downing-street-election-bill-lib-dem-proposal-house-of-commons-impasse\">dismissed it as a \u201cgimmick\u201d</a>. However, Downing Street soon indicated it could adopt the plan if its FTPA-based election bid failed.</p> <p>However, agreement seems some way off amid mutual mistrust over issues such as the fact that a bill could be amended.</p> <p>Asked about the idea on Monday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, refused to be drawn, calling the government motion the \u201cquickest and easiest and safest route\u201d to an election. He told Sky: \u201cWhat the prime minister is determined to do is get this vote through tonight.\u201d</p> <p>But Williamson said he believed MPs were getting behind an election: \u201cThey are moving to recognition that this parliament isn\u2019t going to deliver anything. It doesn\u2019t want no deal. It doesn\u2019t want a deal. It seems to not want an election. That\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d</p> <p>The schools minister, Nick Gibb, told the Today programme Swinson sought an election in order to \u201cdisobey\u201d the mandate given in the EU referendum. \u201cThey want to revoke article 50 and keep us in the EU,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Lib Dem/SNP plan also opens a divide with Labour, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/27/labour-agree-election-boris-johnson-never-pursue-no-deal-brexit-jeremy-corbyn\">which </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/27/labour-agree-election-boris-johnson-never-pursue-no-deal-brexit-jeremy-corbyn\">has said</a> it can only back an election if Johnson categorically rules out no deal, both at the end of January and if no permanent trade deal is in place by December 2020.</p> <p>In seeking an election the Lib Dems have given up on their preference for a second referendum. Swinson said Jeremy Corbyn had been \u201cmissing in action on Brexit\u201d, and that without Labour support in parliament a second referendum would not happen.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any guarantee that waiting is going to make the Labour party suddenly get a serious position on Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what waiting would do is risk no deal. Because if we waste this extension and we end up with that 31 January deadline looming, assuming it\u2019s granted today, and we haven\u2019t done anything with this time, then there\u2019s no guarantee the EU will extend again.\u201d</p> <p>Swinson told Today she believed this had helped the EU move towards agreeing a Brexit extension to 31 January.</p> <p>She said: \u201cOne of their big concerns was that they offered an extension earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/11/may-agrees-to-october-brexit-after-franco-german-carve-up\">said \u2018don\u2019t waste the time\u2019</a>, and then we had a Conservative leadership election and Boris Johnson mucked about not trying to get a deal, shutting down parliament, the very masterclass in timewasting. So understandably they had a degree of reluctance.\u201d</p>",

While the government remains officially focused on calling an election through a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA), this would need a two-thirds majority and a third attempt at this route appears destined to fail when MPs vote on Monday afternoon, with Labour set to abstain. If it does not pass, Swinson said she expected Boris Johnson\u2019s government to get behind a joint Lib Dem and Scottish National party plan to call an election in December by simply amending the FTPA, which would require a standard majority. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Swinson told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cThis bill is one that we have drafted. It ties the prime minister\u2019s hands about the date of the election. It sets it in law, so it doesn\u2019t give him the wriggle room that his plan would have. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from behind the scenes, but I have written to him this morning, so I will hope to get a response this morning.\u201d When the idea for the bill-based election was first revealed on Sunday, Johnson\u2019s ministers dismissed it as a \u201cgimmick\u201d. However, Downing Street soon indicated it could adopt the plan if its FTPA-based election bid failed. However, agreement seems some way off amid mutual mistrust over issues such as the fact that a bill could be amended. Asked about the idea on Monday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, refused to be drawn, calling the government motion the \u201cquickest and easiest and safest route\u201d to an election. He told Sky: \u201cWhat the prime minister is determined to do is get this vote through tonight.\u201d But Williamson said he believed MPs were getting behind an election: \u201cThey are moving to recognition that this parliament isn\u2019t going to deliver anything. It doesn\u2019t want no deal. It doesn\u2019t want a deal. It seems to not want an election. That\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d The schools minister, Nick Gibb, told the Today programme Swinson sought an election in order to \u201cdisobey\u201d the mandate given in the EU referendum. \u201cThey want to revoke article 50 and keep us in the EU,\u201d he said. The Lib Dem/SNP plan also opens a divide with Labour, which has said it can only back an election if Johnson categorically rules out no deal, both at the end of January and if no permanent trade deal is in place by December 2020. In seeking an election the Lib Dems have given up on their preference for a second referendum. Swinson said Jeremy Corbyn had been \u201cmissing in action on Brexit\u201d, and that without Labour support in parliament a second referendum would not happen. \u201cI don\u2019t see any guarantee that waiting is going to make the Labour party suddenly get a serious position on Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what waiting would do is risk no deal. Because if we waste this extension and we end up with that 31 January deadline looming, assuming it\u2019s granted today, and we haven\u2019t done anything with this time, then there\u2019s no guarantee the EU will extend again.\u201d Swinson told Today she believed this had helped the EU move towards agreeing a Brexit extension to 31 January. She said: \u201cOne of their big concerns was that they offered an extension earlier this year, said \u2018don\u2019t waste the time\u2019, and then we had a Conservative leadership election and Boris Johnson mucked about not trying to get a deal, shutting down parliament, the very masterclass in timewasting. So understandably they had a degree of reluctance.\u201d",

It\u2019s shorthand for \u201cBe the change you wish to see\u201d, and like these other upbeat phrases it seems to stem from good intentions. But again it thrusts the responsibility for big problems on the individual, not the powerful. It\u2019s a cheerful way of telling someone to get their own house in order before they dare levy criticism elsewhere. Don\u2019t bother coming out to a climate protest against the corporations that cause the vast majority of global emissions if you\u2019ve ever drunk from a paper cup or eaten a hamburger. What if the change you don\u2019t want to see is the departure from your country from the European Union? Too bad. \u201cGet ready for Brexit\u201d is surely the most meaningless exhortation of them all. Get ready for what? How? When? No matter. Rise and shine! You got this. \u2022 Jean Hannah Edelstein is a freelance journalist and author in New York",

Its most treasured item, the $30m 128-carat yellow Tiffany diamond, was worn by Hepburn for Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s publicity shots for the film and was worn at the 2019 Oscars by Lady Gaga. In a two-sentence statement LVMH, which is already the world\u2019s largest luxury goods company, confirmed it \u201chas held preliminary discussions regarding a possible transaction with Tiffany\u201d, but refused to comment further.

Tiffany\u2019s chief executive, Alessandro Bogliolo, said earlier this month that the company had moved some of its most expensive pieces, including diamond necklaces valued at more than $1m, from the US to mainland China. \u201cWe follow our customers where they shop,\u201d he said. A lower Chinese domestic sales tax introduced by the government to \u201crepatriate consumption\u201d by its citizens led to a double-digit decrease in sales to Chinese tourists in Tiffany\u2019s US stores. \u201cLVMH\u2019s attempt to put a $14.5bn ring on Tiffany, having already added Bulgari a couple of years ago is likely to take the fight in this sector to its closest rival Richemont, who owns Cartier, and would help LVMH in gaining better access to US markets,\u201d said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at spread-betting firm CMC Markets UK.

      "body": "<p>At one point in his touring show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/21/lenny-henry-wish-somebody-taught-me-to-defend-myself\">Lenny Henry</a> recalls a Tiswas sketch he took part in that riffed on the once popular TV show This Is Your Life. Its host Eamonn Andrews may be long dead but his spirit lives on in the fashion for tours like Henry\u2019s: staged autobiographies, liberally illustrated with clips and celebrity anecdotes from his illustrious career. Henry\u2019s offering \u2013 to promote his memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/09/who-am-i-again-lenny-henry-review\">Who Am I, Again?</a> \u2013 typifies what\u2019s good, and what\u2019s insufferable, about the genre. It offers perspective on the man and his remarkable career, inspiring affection and respect. But by the end, after an inauthentic second-act Q&amp;A, I found it off-puttingly cosy and self-admiring.</p> <p>Others may differ but, for me, employing someone to interview you on stage \u2013 to ask toadying (and obviously scripted) questions about your recent PhD, acting success and charity work \u2013 is unbecoming. Particularly for a comedian, from whom we\u2019re entitled to demand something more subversive or self-ironic than this. It\u2019s not that the results aren\u2019t passably entertaining, but no more so than a TV chat show, as Henry\u2019s pal Jon Canter tees up one clubbable big-name anecdote after another, or asks just the right question to prompt Henry\u2019s rubbish rap about the new black family on Coronation Street.</p> <p>The show begins as Henry bounds on stage to announce \u201cI\u2019m 61!\u201d \u2013 the age, he says, when people want to tell their life story. It\u2019s a little disingenuous, given that several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/mar/08/comedy.artsfeatures\">previous shows</a> covered the same material (on his strict mum; on his childhood torn between Dudley and Jamaica) as this one. But fair enough: he tells the stories well, replete with slides and readings from his book. He has the audience mimic his mum\u2019s \u201cJamaican laugh\u201d. He tells a horror story about setting his childhood home on fire and a cheerful one about the friendly flasher in his local park.</p> <p>His mother dominates proceedings as she did Lenny\u2019s youth, even if the tales of her authoritarian parenting seem familiar. Henry acknowledges as much, then hits us with a story that\u2019s his alone, about revelations on the other side of his family, and a feeling that he \u201cfell between two dads\u201d. Racism features, too, in the story of a friendship crudely sundered with a white boy next door.</p> <p>The memoir runs from 1958 to 1980, or \u201cbirth to Tiswas\u201d, Henry tells us. So it is disappointing that the narrative ends just as he was finding success \u2013 beautiful and fresh-faced at only 16 \u2013 on TV\u2019s New Faces talent show. The footage of his act \u2013 both boy and era a weird mix of innocent and compromised \u2013 is mesmerising. Then the story abruptly stops, substituted for a Q&amp;A hopping across Henry\u2019s five-decade career. The focus of the first act is squandered, although the conversation does prompt interesting remarks from Henry about the overlap between \u201ch\u2019integration\u201d (as urged by his mum) and mimicry, the skill with which he made his name.</p> <p>The show could use more of these deeper, harder-won reflections on Henry\u2019s bifurcated sense of self as a pioneering black entertainer of mainstream audiences. Instead, we get backstage gossip about Dustin Hoffman, and Henry\u2019s loving Tommy Cooper tribute act. He seems less at ease with himself in this second act, as if he senses the format is phoney. I left liking the man but wishing he\u2019d created a more coherent, less self-congratulatory show.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/lenny-henry-tickets/artist/1207200\">Touring until 20 November</a>. </p>",

      "bodyText": "At one point in his touring show, Lenny Henry recalls a Tiswas sketch he took part in that riffed on the once popular TV show This Is Your Life. Its host Eamonn Andrews may be long dead but his spirit lives on in the fashion for tours like Henry\u2019s: staged autobiographies, liberally illustrated with clips and celebrity anecdotes from his illustrious career. Henry\u2019s offering \u2013 to promote his memoir Who Am I, Again? \u2013 typifies what\u2019s good, and what\u2019s insufferable, about the genre. It offers perspective on the man and his remarkable career, inspiring affection and respect. But by the end, after an inauthentic second-act Q&amp;A, I found it off-puttingly cosy and self-admiring. Others may differ but, for me, employing someone to interview you on stage \u2013 to ask toadying (and obviously scripted) questions about your recent PhD, acting success and charity work \u2013 is unbecoming. Particularly for a comedian, from whom we\u2019re entitled to demand something more subversive or self-ironic than this. It\u2019s not that the results aren\u2019t passably entertaining, but no more so than a TV chat show, as Henry\u2019s pal Jon Canter tees up one clubbable big-name anecdote after another, or asks just the right question to prompt Henry\u2019s rubbish rap about the new black family on Coronation Street. The show begins as Henry bounds on stage to announce \u201cI\u2019m 61!\u201d \u2013 the age, he says, when people want to tell their life story. It\u2019s a little disingenuous, given that several previous shows covered the same material (on his strict mum; on his childhood torn between Dudley and Jamaica) as this one. But fair enough: he tells the stories well, replete with slides and readings from his book. He has the audience mimic his mum\u2019s \u201cJamaican laugh\u201d. He tells a horror story about setting his childhood home on fire and a cheerful one about the friendly flasher in his local park. His mother dominates proceedings as she did Lenny\u2019s youth, even if the tales of her authoritarian parenting seem familiar. Henry acknowledges as much, then hits us with a story that\u2019s his alone, about revelations on the other side of his family, and a feeling that he \u201cfell between two dads\u201d. Racism features, too, in the story of a friendship crudely sundered with a white boy next door. The memoir runs from 1958 to 1980, or \u201cbirth to Tiswas\u201d, Henry tells us. So it is disappointing that the narrative ends just as he was finding success \u2013 beautiful and fresh-faced at only 16 \u2013 on TV\u2019s New Faces talent show. The footage of his act \u2013 both boy and era a weird mix of innocent and compromised \u2013 is mesmerising. Then the story abruptly stops, substituted for a Q&amp;A hopping across Henry\u2019s five-decade career. The focus of the first act is squandered, although the conversation does prompt interesting remarks from Henry about the overlap between \u201ch\u2019integration\u201d (as urged by his mum) and mimicry, the skill with which he made his name. The show could use more of these deeper, harder-won reflections on Henry\u2019s bifurcated sense of self as a pioneering black entertainer of mainstream audiences. Instead, we get backstage gossip about Dustin Hoffman, and Henry\u2019s loving Tommy Cooper tribute act. He seems less at ease with himself in this second act, as if he senses the format is phoney. I left liking the man but wishing he\u2019d created a more coherent, less self-congratulatory show. \u2022 Touring until 20 November.",

But I would not swap my job for any other.</p> <p>As global environment editor for the Guardian, I report from the Amazon to the Arctic on the disappearing wonders of a rapidly deteriorating world. Along with a growing number of colleagues, I investigate who is affected, who is to blame and who is fighting back. </p> <p>This is both depressing and exciting. The trends for the climate, the oceans, the forests and the soil are unrelentingly frightening. Humanity has never faced a more wicked problem than the collapse of these natural life support systems. Nobody is free of responsibility. Everybody has something to lose, especially those with the most power. The challenge is huge, urgent and beset with opponents. But change is happening nonetheless.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/16/the-guardians-climate-pledge-2019\">The Guardian's climate pledge 2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The primary challenge for a journalist is to make it feel personal. Without that, the science becomes abstract, global issues seem too huge to grasp, and it becomes difficult to relate to far off places and other species. Without that, the \u201cenvironment\u201d slips too easily into an elite pigeonhole for academics, policymakers and middle-class white people, when it should be recognised as the main driver of inequality, conflict and injustice. This is not just another subject; it is a prism through which to see the world.</p> <p>I came to this view reluctantly. Starting as a cub reporter in Asia in the 1990s, I initially wrote about politics, finance and sport \u2013 issues that are traditionally considered newsworthy because they are fast moving, human-focussed and marketable.

      "bodyText": "Some days, I am filled with dread. Some nights, I have trouble sleeping. But I would not swap my job for any other. As global environment editor for the Guardian, I report from the Amazon to the Arctic on the disappearing wonders of a rapidly deteriorating world. Along with a growing number of colleagues, I investigate who is affected, who is to blame and who is fighting back. This is both depressing and exciting. The trends for the climate, the oceans, the forests and the soil are unrelentingly frightening. Humanity has never faced a more wicked problem than the collapse of these natural life support systems. Nobody is free of responsibility. Everybody has something to lose, especially those with the most power. The challenge is huge, urgent and beset with opponents. But change is happening nonetheless. The primary challenge for a journalist is to make it feel personal. Without that, the science becomes abstract, global issues seem too huge to grasp, and it becomes difficult to relate to far off places and other species. Without that, the \u201cenvironment\u201d slips too easily into an elite pigeonhole for academics, policymakers and middle-class white people, when it should be recognised as the main driver of inequality, conflict and injustice. This is not just another subject; it is a prism through which to see the world. I came to this view reluctantly. Starting as a cub reporter in Asia in the 1990s, I initially wrote about politics, finance and sport \u2013 issues that are traditionally considered newsworthy because they are fast moving, human-focussed and marketable. But the more I travelled as a foreign correspondent, the harder it became to ignore how the degradation of the air, water, soil and climate was threatening people, other species and future generations. These themes rarely made front-page news, but they were often the underlying cause of political tension, economic instability and psychological unease. In the noughties I visited Tibet to look at a new railway development, but discovered greater concerns about denuded grasslands, desertification and melting glaciers. In Xinjiang and Mongolia, I went to report on ethnic tensions but came to realise how they were heightened by a massive expansion of mining operations and an influx of construction workers.

In 2012, I moved to Latin America, hoping to find a less destructive model of development, but found similar tensions in the Amazon, Patagonia and Atlantic. If anything, there were even greater levels of corruption and political instability connected to resource extraction and infrastructure projects. Media organisations tend to focus on the local sparks of protests, scandals and bankruptcies, but viewed together from a global environmental perspective, it is possible to make out a broader pattern of exploitation and increasing evidence of a systemic breakdown. Single articles do not easily capture this so it is sometimes important to gather material together and collaborate with other organisations in bigger journalistic projects such as the Polluters, Green Blood, Age of Extinction and Defenders. More important still is to take the \u201cenvironment\u201d out of a media ghetto, in which it is treated as a separate and somewhat fringe subject with a specialist vocabulary that can create even greater distance. In English, the word \u201cenvironment\u201d is uneasy on the ear and stiffly at odds with the vibrant orgy of life it represents. This reflects the word\u2019s hodgepodge Victorian origins. The first use of \u201cenvironment\u201d in its modern sense was in 1828 by the Scottish thinker Thomas Carlyle, who borrowed the French \u201cenviron\u201d (surrounding) to express the German term \u201cumgebung\u201d in a controversial translation of Goethe. In that era, the word denoted \u2013 as now \u2013 a flux of landscape, spirit and culture that shaped humanity more naturally than the mechanistic drives of the Industrial Revolution.

We should be seeking to build an EU that is open to the rest of the world and committed to democracy, the rule of law and social justice with a forceful approach to the far right. Instead, the opponents of global democracy, I fear, have been strengthened. \u2022 Luke Cooper is an associate researcher and consultant at the LSE Conflict and Civil Society Research Unit and a co-founder of the Another Europe Is Possible campaign",

      "body": "<p>The British countryside is rich with dark tales, and while the term \u201cfolk horror\u201d might be more popularly associated with film \u2013 think Edward Woodward facing pagan sacrifice on a remote Scottish island in 1973\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wicker-man\" title=\"\">The Wicker Man</a></em> \u2013 the last few years have seen a growing number of literary horror stories. Think of Jenn Ashworth\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/30/fell-jenn-ashworth-review-novel\" title=\"\">Fell</a>,</em> set on the eerie mudflats of Morecambe Bay, or Kerry Andrew\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/07/swansong-kerry-andrew-review\" title=\"\">Swansong,</a> </em>with its<em> </em>ominous dead birds, as well as the recent anthologies <em>The Fiends in the Furrows</em> and <em>This Dreaming Isle</em>.</p> <p>These stories don\u2019t have to be supernatural. The \u201chorror\u201d in folk horror can often stem from isolation, and the permission remoteness seems to give to human depravity, as in Fiona Mozley\u2019s Booker-shortlisted <em>Elmet</em> and Benjamin Myers\u2019 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/25/the-gallows-pole-benjamin-myers-review\" title=\"\">The Gallows Pole</a></em>, each set in rural Yorkshire. In both, seclusion enables violence. What makes them \u201cfolk horror\u201d is the way the brutality in them emerges from places with violent histories that still linger, ghost-like, in the landscape. The forthcoming <em>Pine</em>, the debut novel from Francine Toon, centres on mysterious disappearances in the Scottish Highlands. In Adam Nevill\u2019s <em>The Reddening</em>, a journalist moves to the coast to try to start a new life but finds herself troubled by the discovery of ancient remains in a local cave.</p> <p>This year\u2019s summer cinema hit <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/03/midsommar-review-ari-aster-florence-pugh\" title=\"\">Midsommar</a> </em>was explicitly billed by its director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/horror-director-ari-aster-hereditary-midsommar-terrors\" title=\"\">Ari Aster</a> as a \u201ccontribution to the folk horror subgenre\u201d, in homage to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/wicker-man-hardy-horror\" title=\"\">The Wicker Man</a></em>. In that earlier film, the protagonist Sergeant Howie is dispatched to Summerisle in the course of his duty. But in <em>Midsommar</em> the main character, Dani, agrees to attend the eponymous Swedish festival in the hope that it will repair her relationship with her boyfriend and, more importantly, help her come to terms with the deaths of her sister and parents. She is charmed by a promise of deliverance, just as Juliette in my new novel <em>Starve Acre</em> is drawn from Leeds to the Yorkshire Dales, trusting in the \u201cgoodness of country living\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Part of folk horror\u2019s role is to unearth forgotten barbarities and injustices and make us look at ourselves afresh</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a recurring motif in folk horror that the countryside beckons to the characters as a place of hope. That events often culminate in graphic violence is a given: this is horror, after all. What is more interesting is the way in which these stories show how we\u2019re seduced by the idea that the natural world is where we\u2019ll find some kind of restoration, enlightenment and, ultimately, peace.</p> <p>This has been a pervasive notion throughout history. The same wisdom that equates nature with wellbeing is what prompted Cyrus the Great to build his vast public gardens at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/dec/23/iran.artsnews\" title=\"\">Pasargadae</a> two and a half thousand years ago and what led to the formation of the UK\u2019s national parks in the 1950s. In literature, too, the rural is often depicted as a place of refuge. I think of the notebooks Coleridge kept as he tramped the Cumbrian fells in a bid to wean himself off laudanum, full of moments in which the terrain induces in him a kind of euphoric insight. Today we have Richard Mabey, who in his memoir <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview2\" title=\"\">Nature Cure</a></em> finds a salve for depression in the flatlands of Norfolk; or Helen Macdonald, in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/h-is-for-hawk-review-helen-macdonald-taming-goshawk-mabel\" title=\"\">H Is for Hawk</a></em>, who grapples with bereavement as she trains her goshawk, Mabel. In Raynor Winn\u2019s recent book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/06/home-is-a-state-of-mind-you-dont-need-walls\" title=\"\">The Salt Path</a></em>, it\u2019s against the windswept cliffs of the south-west coast that the consequences of terminal illness are calibrated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"824e491b726a1ea092ecb920b6487433d3ca5904\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/824e491b726a1ea092ecb920b6487433d3ca5904/0_7_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle in The Wicker Man (1973).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle in <em>The Wicker Man</em> (1973).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/British Lion/Studiocanal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Wordsworth says \u201cLet nature be your teacher\u201d, it seems like sound advice. The trouble is, the classroom is falling apart. The recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/03/populations-of-uks-most-important-wildlife-have-plummeted-since-1970\" title=\"\">State of Nature report</a> concludes that almost a quarter of mammals and half of birds in the UK are under threat of extinction from a combination of climate change, farming practices, pollution and the construction of new housing estates, making it \u201cone of the most nature-depleted countries in the world\u201d. The urgency to preserve \u2013 in direct action and in literature \u2013 the habitats that shaped us and shape us still has never been stronger. And although the tales of ghosts, sacrifice, devils and debauchery are unsettling, folk horror plays an important role in this process.</p> <p>It\u2019s no coincidence that its popularity has risen with that of \u201cnature writing\u201d. Like the best examples of that genre, it is concerned with a conservation of particulars. It engages in a deep mapping of place, connecting layers of history, ecology, folklore and memory. It accommodates the supernatural and the eldritch, both of which are often ramped up to provide the horror. But, artistic licence aside, they remain a significant part of the totality of rural Britain, which is haunted by its past \u2013 perhaps even cursed because we\u2019ve buried our unpalatable actions so deeply. Part of folk horror\u2019s role is to unearth forgotten barbarities and injustices and make us look at ourselves afresh. It was on England\u2019s clouded hills that we built our gallows \u2013 an image of cruelty rendered so starkly in Michael Reeves\u2019s 1968 film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/25/1\" title=\"\">Witchfinder General</a></em>, and which greatly alarms Fanshawe in MR James\u2019s 1925 story \u201cA View from a Hill\u201d. Scanning the idyllic English countryside with a strange pair of binoculars, he suddenly lights upon a scene from the past and sees \u201csomething hanging on the gibbet\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d62957e8e5ce013e3d6a938b01c9be4b32603f81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d62957e8e5ce013e3d6a938b01c9be4b32603f81/0_0_2288_1373/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Reeves\u2019s Witchfinder General (1968)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stark \u2026 Michael Reeves\u2019s <em>Witchfinder General</em> (1968)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As polemic, folk horror can perform a needful check on the indiscriminate romanticising of ourselves and our country. It can be an antidote to the jingoism that arises when nostalgia is cut with nationalism and moments of history are co-opted by the right or the far right. Recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/29/britain-first-anti-islam-group-that-bills-itself-as-a-patriotic-movement\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/29/britain-first-anti-islam-group-that-bills-itself-as-a-patriotic-movement\" title=\"\">anti-Muslim group Britain First</a> dubbed their repugnant vigilante patrols of the south coast \u201cOperation White Cliffs\u201d, and Conservative Brexiters are fond of evoking the famous \u201cBritish pluck\u201d of the second world war in response to the perceived machinations of the EU. What\u2019s being peddled here is the myth that the country of our forebears was, if not peaceful, then at least somehow more understandable than ours. People were decent, the \u201cright\u201d sort were in power, the law was respected, morals upheld, the lines between \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d, \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d, more clearly defined, cause and effect more obviously coupled.

      "bodyText": "The British countryside is rich with dark tales, and while the term \u201cfolk horror\u201d might be more popularly associated with film \u2013 think Edward Woodward facing pagan sacrifice on a remote Scottish island in 1973\u2019s The Wicker Man \u2013 the last few years have seen a growing number of literary horror stories. Think of Jenn Ashworth\u2019s Fell, set on the eerie mudflats of Morecambe Bay, or Kerry Andrew\u2019s Swansong, with its ominous dead birds, as well as the recent anthologies The Fiends in the Furrows and This Dreaming Isle. These stories don\u2019t have to be supernatural. The \u201chorror\u201d in folk horror can often stem from isolation, and the permission remoteness seems to give to human depravity, as in Fiona Mozley\u2019s Booker-shortlisted Elmet and Benjamin Myers\u2019 The Gallows Pole, each set in rural Yorkshire. In both, seclusion enables violence. What makes them \u201cfolk horror\u201d is the way the brutality in them emerges from places with violent histories that still linger, ghost-like, in the landscape. The forthcoming Pine, the debut novel from Francine Toon, centres on mysterious disappearances in the Scottish Highlands. In Adam Nevill\u2019s The Reddening, a journalist moves to the coast to try to start a new life but finds herself troubled by the discovery of ancient remains in a local cave. This year\u2019s summer cinema hit Midsommar was explicitly billed by its director Ari Aster as a \u201ccontribution to the folk horror subgenre\u201d, in homage to The Wicker Man. In that earlier film, the protagonist Sergeant Howie is dispatched to Summerisle in the course of his duty. But in Midsommar the main character, Dani, agrees to attend the eponymous Swedish festival in the hope that it will repair her relationship with her boyfriend and, more importantly, help her come to terms with the deaths of her sister and parents. She is charmed by a promise of deliverance, just as Juliette in my new novel Starve Acre is drawn from Leeds to the Yorkshire Dales, trusting in the \u201cgoodness of country living\u201d. It\u2019s a recurring motif in folk horror that the countryside beckons to the characters as a place of hope. That events often culminate in graphic violence is a given: this is horror, after all. What is more interesting is the way in which these stories show how we\u2019re seduced by the idea that the natural world is where we\u2019ll find some kind of restoration, enlightenment and, ultimately, peace. This has been a pervasive notion throughout history. The same wisdom that equates nature with wellbeing is what prompted Cyrus the Great to build his vast public gardens at Pasargadae two and a half thousand years ago and what led to the formation of the UK\u2019s national parks in the 1950s. In literature, too, the rural is often depicted as a place of refuge. I think of the notebooks Coleridge kept as he tramped the Cumbrian fells in a bid to wean himself off laudanum, full of moments in which the terrain induces in him a kind of euphoric insight. Today we have Richard Mabey, who in his memoir Nature Cure finds a salve for depression in the flatlands of Norfolk; or Helen Macdonald, in H Is for Hawk, who grapples with bereavement as she trains her goshawk, Mabel. In Raynor Winn\u2019s recent book, The Salt Path, it\u2019s against the windswept cliffs of the south-west coast that the consequences of terminal illness are calibrated. When Wordsworth says \u201cLet nature be your teacher\u201d, it seems like sound advice. The trouble is, the classroom is falling apart. The recent State of Nature report concludes that almost a quarter of mammals and half of birds in the UK are under threat of extinction from a combination of climate change, farming practices, pollution and the construction of new housing estates, making it \u201cone of the most nature-depleted countries in the world\u201d. The urgency to preserve \u2013 in direct action and in literature \u2013 the habitats that shaped us and shape us still has never been stronger. And although the tales of ghosts, sacrifice, devils and debauchery are unsettling, folk horror plays an important role in this process. It\u2019s no coincidence that its popularity has risen with that of \u201cnature writing\u201d. Like the best examples of that genre, it is concerned with a conservation of particulars. It engages in a deep mapping of place, connecting layers of history, ecology, folklore and memory. It accommodates the supernatural and the eldritch, both of which are often ramped up to provide the horror. But, artistic licence aside, they remain a significant part of the totality of rural Britain, which is haunted by its past \u2013 perhaps even cursed because we\u2019ve buried our unpalatable actions so deeply. Part of folk horror\u2019s role is to unearth forgotten barbarities and injustices and make us look at ourselves afresh. It was on England\u2019s clouded hills that we built our gallows \u2013 an image of cruelty rendered so starkly in Michael Reeves\u2019s 1968 film Witchfinder General, and which greatly alarms Fanshawe in MR James\u2019s 1925 story \u201cA View from a Hill\u201d. Scanning the idyllic English countryside with a strange pair of binoculars, he suddenly lights upon a scene from the past and sees \u201csomething hanging on the gibbet\u201d. As polemic, folk horror can perform a needful check on the indiscriminate romanticising of ourselves and our country. It can be an antidote to the jingoism that arises when nostalgia is cut with nationalism and moments of history are co-opted by the right or the far right. Recently, the anti-Muslim group Britain First dubbed their repugnant vigilante patrols of the south coast \u201cOperation White Cliffs\u201d, and Conservative Brexiters are fond of evoking the famous \u201cBritish pluck\u201d of the second world war in response to the perceived machinations of the EU. What\u2019s being peddled here is the myth that the country of our forebears was, if not peaceful, then at least somehow more understandable than ours. People were decent, the \u201cright\u201d sort were in power, the law was respected, morals upheld, the lines between \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d, \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d, more clearly defined, cause and effect more obviously coupled. The past was more coherent \u2013 which, in hindsight, the past always seems to be. It\u2019s this kind of dangerous, atavistic fantasy that folk horror takes to task; indeed, much of the \u201chorror\u201d is predicated on the willingness of seemingly ordinary people to believe these claims. In The Wicker Man, Sergeant Howie\u2019s investigation into a girl\u2019s disappearance is frustrated because he is battling against the will of an entire community, and for all his bluster about their pagan beliefs, he is conscious that the islanders live by a common and unshakeable faith in their practices. In Midsommar, it\u2019s the appearance of communal unity that seemingly appeals to Dani when she arrives at H\u00e5rga for the festival.

There\u2019s a philosophy that underpins everything. Everyone has a role to play. Power is localised and tangible. And so to live in a community where the individual is not only able to grasp that power, but is an inherent part of its potency, is an attractive proposition in an era of relativist truths, fractured democracy, global environmental threats and a society in which the spheres of influence are ineffably remote.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe island is going to be placed where the British empire\u2019s fleet once was,\u201d says Anne Skovbro, looking out from her office in a 19th-century customs house over Copenhagen\u2019s harbour. She points out the mooring posts where tall ships once docked, the old masting crane that marked the harbour\u2019s outer edge, and the patch of sea where Horatio Nelson is supposed to have held a telescope to his blind eye as his ships set the city\u2019s medieval centre ablaze. \u201cFrom defending ourselves from the British, we now have to defend ourselves from the water,\u201d says Skovbro, clearly relishing her role as urban planner leading the development of Copenhagen\u2019s harbour. The planned island to which she is referring, Lynetteholm, is perhaps the most developed expression of an idea that is spreading across the world: protecting cities from rising seas by reclaiming land \u2013 and paying for it by selling the new land off. The island, more accurately described as a peninsula, will stretch across the mouth of Copenhagen\u2019s harbour entrance, leaving only a channel for ferries and cruise ships that could be closed off in cases of storm surges. The reason the idea works (and the reason it can\u2019t be repeated in many other cities) is that the harbour is formed by a narrowish channel between the island of Amager and the mainland. There is already flood protection along the inner coast of Amager, and the southern entry to the harbour is narrow and easy to close off. The \u00d6resund Strait also has a very small tidal range. The island and sluice should therefore protect against storm surges for decades. Once the sea level rises to the height of the waterfront in the inner harbour, the sluice would need to be replaced by a lock system. As well as hopefully obviating the need for grim concrete sea walls like those erected around New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, new islands like these mean new real estate. In Copenhagen the rim of the island facing out to sea will have a soft edge for beaches, parks and wetlands; then, beyond a high protective mound, there will be space for 35,000 houses and a similar number of workplaces. When the project was announced a year ago, Denmark\u2019s then housing minister, Ole Birk Olesen, boasted that the protection from sea-level rise would come for free. \u201cIt will cost around zero kroner,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe will receive payment for disposing of the waste earth. In addition, we will get a free island which we can sell the land from. Selling the land will then finance a sea tunnel.\u201d Since the island expanded from 190 hectares (470 acres) to 282 this August, the financial case has become stronger still. Whereas building a sea dyke to protect Copenhagen would have cost 750m Danish kroner (\u00a387m), the city government estimates that building the island could yield a profit of 2.7bn kroner, simply from selling the earth. Sea change The idea that protecting against climate change could actually be profitable has motivated many other cities to explore similar ideas. Just down the Copenhagen harbour at the Danish Architecture Centre, Bjarke Ingels Group is exhibiting its bold vision of a reimagined New York City coastline. Laid out on tabletops is a model of Manhattan, its waterfront embellished with new parks and solar-powered high-rise buildings. Monitors flash images of devastation from Hurricane Sandy. \u201cWe are basically proposing to expand Manhattan a little bit into the Hudson River and make a few new neighbourhoods that are going to create so much value that we can actually finance the parks on the waterfront,\u201d Ingels told the Venice Biennale last year. The idea was backed in March by New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, who announced $10bn for expanding the coastline as far as 150 metres. \u201cIf there\u2019s not federal money in play, we have to get some private money into it, and there has to be some development,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, faced with the estimated S$100bn (\u00a358bn) cost of combating rising sea levels over the coming century, proposed to reclaim a chain of new islands along the city state\u2019s south-east coast, or else construct a series of Dutch-style polders. \u201cYou not only protect existing low-lying areas, but you extend out and create more land reclaimed from the sea, which we can use for housing and other valuable purposes,\u201d he said in his annual speech to the nation, arguing that the new land would help offset the expense.

      "bodyText": "Smartphones are getting bigger and heavier every year, but our hands aren\u2019t. At some point something has to break. And when it does it\u2019ll either be a sting in the wallet when your phone hits the ground or a pain in the hand as your constant finger stretching induces dreaded RSI. There aren\u2019t any really small smartphones on the market, just smaller phones that are often very expensive. And that doesn\u2019t help you with the phone in your pocket right now, whether an iPhone 11 Pro Max, a Pixel 3 XL or Galaxy Note 10+. So the solution is some kind of accessory to help you keep a grip. Here are five of the best: Popsocket Price: \u00a311.99 and up One of the most popular smartphone accessories you can buy. It\u2019s wildly popular across Asia and in the US and for good reason: it helps you keep a grip without breaking the bank. Essentially, it\u2019s a knob you attach to the back of your phone or case that compresses down like an accordion when not in use. The cap is usually metal or hard plastic and comes in any number of designs. The underside is a tough rubbery material that locks into a plastic disc that attaches firmly to the back of your phone with removable adhesive. Stick your fingers either side and you\u2019re good to go. When popped out it doubles as a kickstand for watching video, or to slot into car mounts. Popsockets are available in a variety of different materials and designs, in mini sizes or attached to wallets and even integrated into cases. The top can be removed to allow wireless charging or swapped with different designs for a bit of variety. They can be fitted to practically any phone, even those with curved backs. When compressed they add a little bit of bulk and can stop it sitting flat on its back, but you should still be able to get the phone into pockets. Verdict An adaptable, fun handle for your phone \u2013 it\u2019s easy to see why they\u2019re so popular. Spigen Style Ring 360 Price: \u00a314.99 There are lots of phone rings available, but this one is arguably the best. The small rotating metal disc sticks on to the back of your phone with strong but removable adhesive. The ring then unfolds from the disc, allowing you to position it how you like. One end is flat, doubling as a kickstand. But it is the effortless hold on the phone that\u2019s the best thing about it \u2013 and the reason I use one. Put your finger through the ring and just grip the phone as you normally would, safe in the knowledge that it won\u2019t drop because it\u2019s attached to you. The flat disc design makes it one of the lowest-profile accessories available. It\u2019s magnetic for attaching to car mounts. Verdict Simple, low profile and provides an assured grip, but blocks wireless charging, unfortunately. Speck Grabtab Price: \u00a37.95 It may look like a stack of credit cards stuck to the back of your phone, but it is a surprisingly comfortable and assured grip aid. It has a flexible strip of plastic that slides on runners in the centre of the pad, forming a loop as it slides up from the bottom. Slip your finger through the loop and let it take the strain of holding on to your phone. It doesn\u2019t block wireless charging but, given the width, you\u2019ll struggle to stick it to phones with too much of a curved back. It comes in various colours and printed patterns but it\u2019s not the most attractive solution. The tab never quite stays completely flat once bent, but it doesn\u2019t make the phone rock around on a table and is one of the thinner solutions. Verdict Cheap and effective, particularly if you still want to be able to wirelessly charge your phone. Xtreme Skins vinyl skins Price: \u00a38.99 If you like the slim profile of your phone but wish that it had a little bit more texture to grip, or a little bit of scratch protection, vinyl skins are a great option. A wrap from UK-based Xtreme Skins was super easy to apply, even on curved devices, and only took about five minutes, with video walkthroughs to show you how \u2013 plus a little heat from a hairdryer around the edges. Sadly, none are quite grip-tape-like, but if your phone is of the super slippery variety they can be just enough to make handling a little bit easier. Verdict A little bit of texture and scratch protection without ruining the slimline profile of your phone. Speck Presidio Grip Price: \u00a330 Grips and skins are one thing, but if you want a bit of impact protection too, then a case is the way forward. The trouble is that most cases add to the problem of grip by making phones thicker, wider and heavier. Others are fairly slippery, or are so sticky that you can\u2019t get them out of a pocket. This one finds a good balance. It applies like any other case \u2013 just press your phone in and away you go. It\u2019s solid and looks like it can take a beating, but has ribbed rubber around the sides and back, making it a lot easier to grip with your fingers. Verdict Its ribbed rubber sides and back should help you keep a hold of your phone if a case is the way to go. The dreaded RSI Phone-related repetitive strain injury is nothing new: just look at BlackBerry thumb in the 2000s. But as smartphones have become supersized a new sort of hand pain has emerged, and, once you have it, it\u2019s very difficult to cure. I know because I\u2019ve suffered from it ever since reviewing the 208g iPhone XS Max last year. Big, wide and slippery phones mean many people have resorted to putting their little fingers underneath the bottom of the phone to hold them in place. But as the weight of the phones has increased so has the stress on the poor little finger, which can lead to the unpleasant experience of shooting pains in your palm. The only cure is rest, which means either stopping holding a smartphone (practically impossible), buying a new small phone (in short supply) or changing how you hold it, which is where grips come in. They may not be the coolest thing on the block, but then neither is the potential for crippling pain \u2013 making them some of the smartest buys you\u2019ll make.",

The European council president, Donald Tusk, held intensive discussions over the weekend and ambassadors for the EU27 meet this morning.</p> \n<p>The government will for the third time bring on a vote today seeking an early election under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, coupled with more time to scrutinise the withdrawal bill. MPs are expected to reject this. But over the weekend, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party offered to back a general election on 9 December \u2013 leaving many EU officials convinced the UK will soon go to the polls.

The incumbent, Mauricio Macri, conceded defeat on Sunday night, telling supporters at his headquarters that he had called Fern\u00e1ndez to congratulate him and invited him for a breakfast chat on Monday at the Pink Presidential Palace. A large crowd of supporters burst into a roar outside the Frente de Todos (Everybody\u2019s Front) party bunker in the Chacarita neighbourhood of the capital city of Buenos Aires at 9pm when preliminary official results gave the victory to Fern\u00e1ndez. With almost 70% of the vote counted, Fern\u00e1ndez, who is no relation of Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, recorded a 47% victory against Macri\u2019s 41%.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Gender pay gap widens with age \u2013 </strong>The gender pay gap is at its most extreme for women in their 50s, new research has revealed.

The number of women working in their 50s and 60s has risen by 75% from 2.7 million in 1999 to 4.8 million today. ONS data shows the gender pay gap between age 18 and 21 is 18%, falling to 13% for those in their 20s, rising again to 16% for those in their 30s, and reaching 25% for women and men in their 40s. \u201cMore and more women are working in their 50s and 60s \u2013 and workplace culture needs to catch up to this shift,\u201d said Claire Turner from the Centre for Ageing Better. \u201cMaking all jobs flexible by default would help many of those with caring responsibilities stay in work, and stop them losing out on pay and progression.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Democrat quits after \u2018revenge porn\u2019 \u2013 </strong>The rising Democratic star Katie Hill has resigned from Congress after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/28/katie-hill-rising-democratic-star-resigns-amid-claims-of-relationship-with-staffer\">sexualised smear campaign blamed on the husband she is divorcing</a>. It included naked photographs that were leaked and published by rightwing outlets such as the Daily Mail. Hill was accused of an affair with a staff member, which was denied by both parties. She admitted to a separate relationship with a different staff member on her congressional campaign. In her resignation statement, Hill called the publication of the photographs illegal and said she was \u201ccurrently pursuing all legal options\u201d. Supporters say she is a victim of \u201crevenge porn\u201d, which is a crime in most of the US. Hill said: \u201cHaving private photos of personal moments weaponised against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy. I know that as long as I am in Congress, we\u2019ll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>No place to stay \u2013 </strong>Britannia Hotels has been rated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/28/britannia-hotels-rated-sectors-worst-chain-seventh-year-in-a-row-which-survey\">worst hotel chain in the UK</a> for the seventh year in a row, with guests repeatedly describing its rooms as \u201cfilthy\u201d and complaining about mouldy bathrooms and peeling paintwork. EasyHotel and Ibis Budget also performed badly in the survey by Which?. Wetherspoon Hotels was rated best for the first time, sharing the top spot with Premier Inn, Britain\u2019s biggest hotel chain, which has come first for the last four years.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Lib Dems and SNP offer backing for election Hello, Warren Murray here helping you to start your week in the know about what\u2019s what. The EU is poised today to sign off on a Brexit extension to 31 January 2020 with an option for the UK to leave earlier if a deal is ratified, according to leaked papers seen by the Guardian. The European council president, Donald Tusk, held intensive discussions over the weekend and ambassadors for the EU27 meet this morning. The government will for the third time bring on a vote today seeking an early election under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, coupled with more time to scrutinise the withdrawal bill. MPs are expected to reject this. But over the weekend, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party offered to back a general election on 9 December \u2013 leaving many EU officials convinced the UK will soon go to the polls. No 10 has let it be known it will look at the proposal if Labour does not support the government\u2019s own timetable for the Brexit bill and an election. Labour is insisting on a no-deal Brexit being ruled out before it backs going to the polls. The draft EU paper suggests a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is off the table. Make sure to follow all the developments at our Politics Live blog. * * * End of Baghdadi \u2013 We have some gripping reporting this morning from Martin Chulov and Michael Safi telling not only of the day US forces caught up with the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but the increasingly desperate cat-and-mouse game he had played to avoid his pursuers \u2013 and the intelligence breakthrough that led them to corner him in a remote hamlet of north-western Syria. Backed into a dead-end tunnel, Baghdadi apparently detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three children who were with him. Donald Trump adopted bloodthirsty-sounding language in describing how Baghdadi met his end on Saturday night. The raid by US special forces was named after Kayla Mueller, the humanitarian worker from Arizona who was imprisoned, tortured, sexually abused and killed by Isis. * * * Argentina election \u2013 Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, one of Argentina\u2019s most popular ever presidents, has been voted back into office as vice-president after the opposition candidate Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez won the country\u2019s presidential election. The incumbent, Mauricio Macri, conceded defeat on Sunday night, telling supporters at his headquarters that he had called Fern\u00e1ndez to congratulate him and invited him for a breakfast chat on Monday at the Pink Presidential Palace. A large crowd of supporters burst into a roar outside the Frente de Todos (Everybody\u2019s Front) party bunker in the Chacarita neighbourhood of the capital city of Buenos Aires at 9pm when preliminary official results gave the victory to Fern\u00e1ndez. With almost 70% of the vote counted, Fern\u00e1ndez, who is no relation of Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, recorded a 47% victory against Macri\u2019s 41%. * * * Gender pay gap widens with age \u2013 The gender pay gap is at its most extreme for women in their 50s, new research has revealed. Women\u2019s average salaries at that age are 28% \u2013 or \u00a312,509 \u2013 lower than men\u2019s. The number of women working in their 50s and 60s has risen by 75% from 2.7 million in 1999 to 4.8 million today. ONS data shows the gender pay gap between age 18 and 21 is 18%, falling to 13% for those in their 20s, rising again to 16% for those in their 30s, and reaching 25% for women and men in their 40s. \u201cMore and more women are working in their 50s and 60s \u2013 and workplace culture needs to catch up to this shift,\u201d said Claire Turner from the Centre for Ageing Better. \u201cMaking all jobs flexible by default would help many of those with caring responsibilities stay in work, and stop them losing out on pay and progression.\u201d * * * Democrat quits after \u2018revenge porn\u2019 \u2013 The rising Democratic star Katie Hill has resigned from Congress after a sexualised smear campaign blamed on the husband she is divorcing. It included naked photographs that were leaked and published by rightwing outlets such as the Daily Mail. Hill was accused of an affair with a staff member, which was denied by both parties. She admitted to a separate relationship with a different staff member on her congressional campaign. In her resignation statement, Hill called the publication of the photographs illegal and said she was \u201ccurrently pursuing all legal options\u201d. Supporters say she is a victim of \u201crevenge porn\u201d, which is a crime in most of the US. Hill said: \u201cHaving private photos of personal moments weaponised against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy. I know that as long as I am in Congress, we\u2019ll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt.\u201d * * * No place to stay \u2013 Britannia Hotels has been rated the worst hotel chain in the UK for the seventh year in a row, with guests repeatedly describing its rooms as \u201cfilthy\u201d and complaining about mouldy bathrooms and peeling paintwork. EasyHotel and Ibis Budget also performed badly in the survey by Which?. Wetherspoon Hotels was rated best for the first time, sharing the top spot with Premier Inn, Britain\u2019s biggest hotel chain, which has come first for the last four years. Britannia could not be reached for comment. EasyHotel was rated second-worst and Ibis Budget came third from the bottom with 60%.

And: Waad al-Kateab, the director of the documentary For Sama, on life in Aleppo. Lunchtime read: \u2018An outsider never forgets\u2019 After almost 40 years in parliament, Harriet Harman is vying to replace John Bercow as Speaker and says she wants to restore public faith in politics. She tells Gaby Hinsliff about anger, antisemitism and being heckled as a \u201cstupid cow\u201d by Tory MPs in her first years in Westminster.

J\u00fcrgen Klopp said he loved Liverpool\u2019s rousing comeback against Tottenham but no one inside Anfield would get carried away with a title challenge he described as merely a case of \u201cso far, so good\u201d.

But this is no fossilised museum town; Bologna\u2019s scholarly tradition attracts a constant influx of young people keeping this Emilia-Romagna city vibrant and challenging. Screen idol A 1920s abattoir has been converted into one of Italy\u2019s most important independent cinemas. Two screens show the latest releases and arthouse favourites, all in the original language, not dubbed. The Cinema Lumi\u00e8re is also a major centre for film conservation and restoration. Anyone can access the library, with its huge collection of posters, memorabilia and movies on video, and watch in a screening room (free). On Saturday mornings the piazza outside is taken over by the Mercato Ritrovato, a brilliant organic farmers\u2019 market, selling wines and craft beer, and street food stalls cooking up locally sourced produce. \u2022 Via Azzo Gardino 65/b, cinetecadibologna.it Botanical gardens Located inside the Giardini Margherita, Bologna\u2019s favourite public park, the sprawling botanical gardens recently reopened after years of abandon, and have become one of the most exciting venues in the city \u2013 especially popular with our 100,000-strong student population, who come here to study with the free wifi, and enjoy the cheap food and drinks. Though few of the original glasshouses remain, you can sit out in the ornate plant and herb gardens, where there is a busy programme of concerts, poetry readings and video screenings. There is a popular bar, too, where \u20ac4 buys you a beer, glass of wine or spritz, and a self-service street food counter serving tasty vegetarian and vegan dishes like aubergine and mozzarella burgers or seitan kebabs. \u2022 Via Castiglione 134, leserre.kilowatt.bo.it Old-school osteria Forget the crowded historic and gourmet addresses featured in guidebooks \u2013 Becco Di Legno is one of the last genuine osterie in the city, and offers a real slice of Bologna life. In the 1970s there were lots of watering holes like this, but most have disappeared. The cook has been running the tiny kitchen for 60 years, they have no website or Facebook page, and you need to call first to be sure of a table. The food may not be elaborate, but it is tasty and inexpensive. The main thing people come for is an evening of what Bolognesi call balotta \u2013 hanging out with friends. \u2022 Via Gianni Palmieri 7, +39 051 34 09 43 LGBT hub Bologna was the first city in Italy to allow a municipal building to be used as an LGBT centre, back in 1982.

Next door, be sure to visit Mambo (adult \u20ac6), Bologna\u2019s museum of modern art.

The woman, whose identity was not published, has been locked in a one-year battle with the agency after she was accused of falsely claiming the single parenting payment while in a relationship over a five-year period. But in a decision published this month, the highest level of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal overturned a ruling from a lower tribunal and wiped the $50,000 debt. Under Centrelink rules, single parents are entitled to about $280-a-week in extra parenting payments than those in a declared couple. Welfare recipients are now asked to have a \u201creferee\u201d vouch for their relationship status in a process labelled \u201cintrusive\u201d by critics and the agency investigates alleged breaches of the so-called \u201ccouple rule\u201d. The tribunal was told that the woman, a mother of four in her 30s, was hit with the $50,000 debt in August last year.

He went on to list the address on later documents without her permission. The tribunal was also told Mr \u201cG\u201d was not allowed to live at her home due to substance abuse issues, while she also said she sought an apprehended domestic violence order against him in 2018. DTDJ noted they had no shared assets such as a bank account and that Mr \u201cG\u201d had not provided support for her or her children. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The tribunal member, Louise Bygrave, said DTDJ\u2019s account was \u201cdetailed and credible\u201d.

Figures released by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission on Monday show that while Sydney is still the capital for cocaine, and heroin is most frequently found in Melbourne, it is in regional Australia where drug use is most pronounced. The data \u2013 which analyses wastewater from sites across Australia \u2013 reveals that in regional Australia the average use of methamphetamine, oxycodone, fentanyl, MDMA, cannabis, alcohol and nicotine outstripped capital city consumption. Now in its third year, the commission\u2019s wastewater analysis shows how much of each drug is being consumed around the country, underlining the size of the market. Perhaps most concerning for law enforcement, some drugs have been intercepted at a greater rate than others. While almost twice as much MDMA was seized as was used, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine seizures remained at half or less-than half of consumption. The commission\u2019s chief executive, Michael Phelan, said the latest figures showed demand for drugs \u201chas not gotten any better\u201d. \u201cAustralians have an insatiable demand for all sorts of narcotics and synthetic drugs,\u201d Phelan told reporters in Brisbane. The figures show that population-weighted average consumption of methamphetamine, cocaine, MDMA and heroin in capital city and regional areas all increased in the period measured. Besides heroin use in regional areas, all of those drugs saw the highest consumption levels since measurement began. The data did, however, show an overall drop in the use of prescription opioids such as oxycodone and fentanyl, though in some areas, including Tasmania, the use of the former increased. Sewage analysis cannot differentiate between neighbourhoods or suburbs, and the waste being sampled is a mix of that flowing from prisons, hospitals, offices, homes, hotels and shopping centres. It also cannot distinguish between prescribed or illicit opioid use, or whether nicotine intake is from tobacco, e-cigarettes, patches or gum. The commission aims to establish baseline data of substance use across Australia, claiming the latest data collection represents 55% of Australia\u2019s population, or 12.9 million people.

Her marriage to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/11/laurence-olivier-25-years-anniversary-death\">Laurence Olivier</a> inevitably made her part of showbiz aristocracy but Plowright brought to British theatre a quality of earthiness and emotional directness shared by near-contemporaries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/08/albert-finney-obituary\">Albert Finney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/22/peter-otoole-less-the-drunken-hell-raiser-he-made-out-says-author\">Peter O\u2019Toole</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/22/billie-whitelaw\">Billie Whitelaw</a>. As the daughter of a Lincolnshire newspaper editor, she could hardly be called working-class yet she was part of a movement that helped British theatre shed its aura of evasive gentility.</p> <p>You could, for the sake of convenience, divide Plowright\u2019s working life into three phases: her Royal Court period, her National Theatre years and her post-National freelance career.</p> <p>Rather than catalogue her performances, I would pick out three that illustrate her capacity to give us the unvarnished truth. She came to prominence in the Royal Court of the 1950s but, although I missed her in The Country Wife and the double bill of Ionesco\u2019s The Chairs and The Lesson, where she played a wizened crone and a preyed-on pupil, I did catch her as Beatie Bryant in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/26/theatre\">Arnold Wesker\u2019s Roots</a> \u2013 which quickly became a landmark in postwar drama.</p> <p>The point about Beatie is that she is the daughter of Norfolk farmworkers who, on returning home, first parrots the opinions of her London boyfriend and then, when he fails to turn up, discovers her own voice. Wesker\u2019s play is part of a long line, harking back to Shaw\u2019s Pygmalion and anticipating Willy Russell\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/17/julie-walters-willy-russell-how-we-made-educating-rita\">Educating Rita</a>, about female self-realisation. Everyone who saw it remembers the ecstasy that illumined Plowright\u2019s features as she realised she was at last speaking, and thinking, for herself. But Plowright caught no less well Beatie\u2019s potential for joy in the scene where she danced round the stage as her mother clapped to the rhythmic excitement of Bizet\u2019s suite from L\u2019Arl\u00e9sienne.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c57761c300827d315eb7feb93c9efd68d549ce90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c57761c300827d315eb7feb93c9efd68d549ce90/0_305_3000_1953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joan Plowright and Laurence Olivier on their wedding day in 1961.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joan Plowright and Laurence Olivier on their wedding day in 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NY Daily News via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Olivier claimed to be \u201cknocked off my feet by her performance\u201d. By 1961 he and Plowright were married and she became a vital part of his inaugural Chichester Festival theatre seasons, which provided a launchpad for the National Theatre company. It can sometimes be tedious to bang on about old productions but anyone who wishes can still find on DVD Olivier\u2019s Uncle Vanya which played at Chichester in 1962-63 and then at the Old Vic. It was one of the great Chekhov experiences of the 20th century, and Plowright\u2019s performance as Sonya, hopelessly in love with Astrov (played by Olivier), was a model of stoic endurance in the face of unfulfilled passion.</p> <p>The great moment comes at the play\u2019s end when Sonya is left alone with her uncle to face a future of loveless toil. It would be easy to play Sonya\u2019s final consoling speech sentimentally. Instead Plowright, looking at the desolate features of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/18/michael-redgrave-screen-legend\">Michael Redgrave</a> as Vanya, struck a note of almost buoyant optimism as she claimed: \u201cWhen our time comes, we shall die without a murmur \u2026 we shall see a light that is bright and lovely and beautiful \u2026 we shall rest.\u201d Plowright caught perfectly Sonya\u2019s note of defiant faith in a way that brought tears to my eyes at the time, and that still does when I watch or listen to that performance.</p> <p>Plowright went on to do many fine things at the National including a strong-willed Maggie in Hobson\u2019s Choice, leading her chosen groom off to the marriage bed by his ears, a deeply sensual Masha in Three Sisters and a single-minded Portia in The Merchant of Venice who first preaches mercy and then displays a vindictive cruelty to Shylock. She was an integral part of the National company at the Old Vic, but the determination to avoid any sense of favouritism \u2013 and the fact that she had three young children to bring up \u2013 meant that her potential was not always fulfilled. I would love to have seen her play Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth, or Hedda Gabler.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9f2b3f720e479caaf284cf03384225d8180389f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9f2b3f720e479caaf284cf03384225d8180389f/0_24_2448_1788/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joan Plowright as La Poncia with Julie Legrand, Amanda Root and Deborah Findlay in The House of Bernarda Alba in 1987.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"730\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joan Plowright as La Poncia, with Julie Legrand, Amanda Root and Deborah Findlay, in The House of Bernarda Alba in 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Muir/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the National, however, Plowright achieved much.

The character is the servant to the tyrannical heroine (played by Glenda Jackson).

This is a quality that has characterised much of Plowright\u2019s work: the ability to combine down-to-earth practicality and common sense with an irrepressible joie de vivre. From reading Plowright\u2019s fascinating memoirs, And That\u2019s Not All, you realise how much the National in its early years \u2013 and Olivier in particular \u2013 owed to her quiet wisdom. Looking back over her rich career is to be reminded of how much she has been a force for change in British acting.",

I don\u2019t physically look like this character, and these girls all do.

Days later, she began rehearsals, with Wilson and puppets. In Pullman\u2019s books, people have daemons, an animal manifestation of their \u201cinner self\u201d, which lives alongside them. Because the daemons on screen are CGI, the actors shot their scenes with puppets to make their interactions as authentic as possible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Philip Pullman writes, he isn\u2019t trying to bring down the church, he\u2019s bringing down the system</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Naturally, Keen is practised at describing what her own daemon would be, were this world to have daemons in it. \u201cMine is quite easy to figure out, because it\u2019s what everyone called me on set.

It was supposed to be a trilogy, but only the first was made \u2013 and Pullman\u2019s theme of an abusive authoritarian religious body was watered down almost beyond recognition.

Keen had seen it \u2013 was she aware that this new version might be controversial, given the backlash the movie attracted? \u201cI thought that was sad, but I understand why they had to do it,\u201d she reasons, diplomatically, of the decision to soften the book\u2019s themes. \u201cBut I think people are reading too much into it.

In Northern Lights, the first book of the trilogy, she is \u201clike a half-wild cat\u201d, with dirty fingernails, green eyes and grubby blond-ish hair. Keen, who is half British, half Spanish and lives in Madrid, is darker and is already the master of an intense glare, as anyone who saw her alongside Hugh Jackman in the Wolverine swansong Logan will know. When we meet, in a London hotel, she has the self-possessed cool of a total pro, even at 14. But there are plenty of Lyra-esque flourishes that make it obvious why she got the part.

I\u2019d get nowhere if I walked into a negotiation and behaved like that,\u2019\u201d Harman recalls. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s been very striking is that people think the anger that\u2019s displayed in parliament is an artefact, that it\u2019s basically fake, playing up to the cameras. So if anybody\u2019s under the impression that their anger is regarded as inspiring by people outside \u2013 people don\u2019t buy it.\u201d And that hints at something more complicated than the crude \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d narrative pushed by Downing Street, pitting furious leave voters against a supposedly obstructive elite.</p> <p>Harman\u2019s research suggests the angry, uncompromising stances that many Brexiters (and, arguably, parts of the left) see as connoting passion or ideological purity don\u2019t always come across that way to voters, many of whom see squabbling and division merely as proof of impotence. Resorting to shouting is seen as \u201cthe ultimate failure of an institution\u201d, says Harman. \u201cIn the outside world, people disagree about Brexit but they get along.\u201d If she\u2019s right, then politicians who believe they are channelling the public mood by ratcheting up their language may be in for a shock come a general election.</p> <p>We have, of course, been here before. David Cameron vowed to end <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/08/henry-porter-proportional-representation\" title=\"\">\u201cPunch and Judy politics\u201d</a> and Jeremy Corbyn promised a \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d form of it, yet neither delivered. Some argue that the adversarial nature of politics means the temperature can\u2019t be lowered, but Harman disagrees. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of MPs don\u2019t behave like that in their [private] life and know that it\u2019s not the right way to present our work to the public, but it\u2019s been impossible to stop it. We have got to enable parliament to decide for itself that it\u2019s going to change.\u201d Change can\u2019t simply be imposed, she says, but \u201cthe Speaker can facilitate parliament actually looking at itself in the mirror and deciding: \u2018Do we want to go on like this?\u2019 If the answer is: \u2018No, we don\u2019t\u2019, then the Speaker has got the mandate to change it. The Speaker has got all sorts of controls over how they select people to speak, or deal with those who interrupt \u2026\u201d</p> <p>She insists that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a bland or neutered politics, citing the 2003 debate over the Iraq war, during which the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, resigned. \u201cNobody felt that there weren\u2019t passionate beliefs on all sides, nobody felt that was not a debate of the utmost seriousness. There were very big divisions in the country and in parliament. Yet the debates did not descend into shouting, abuse and finger-jabbing. It\u2019s not about dumbing down parliament or fudging over differences, it\u2019s about respecting what the people think about their parliament. We can\u2019t ignore that because, if people have contempt for their parliament, that\u2019s undermining parliamentary democracy and creates a vacuum.\u201d</p> <p>Parliament rarely looks more out of touch than during the state opening, when the Queen arrives in a horse-drawn carriage to a flurry of bowing, but Harman isn\u2019t advocating reducing the pomp. \u201cI think people recognise that for what it is, part of our culture and heritage and tradition.\u201d And while she backs changing summer recess dates to reflect Scottish school holidays, which would allow Scottish MPs some time away from Westminster while their children are off, more broadly she insists that it\u2019s not for the Speaker to dictate how parliament should modernise, but merely to facilitate what MPs want.</p> <p>Still, the longest-serving female MP must think it is ridiculous that MPs have no formal right to maternity leave from their constituency; and that Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy has had to have a public battle to get locum cover for when she gives birth this autumn. Harman says that attitudes have shifted thanks to the influx not only of women MPs but of men who expect time off when they become fathers. \u201cI remember, back in the day, one of my fellow MPs got up and said: \u2018On a point of order, Mr Chairman, can I just ask the committee to take note that my wife has just had a baby?\u2019 I was thinking: \u2018So why are you here?\u2019 but everyone was like \u2018hear hear\u2019 and then we carried on with the committee. That\u2019s not the aspiration of men having young families now in the House of Commons or outside.\u201d Yet as she concedes, it was just last year that pregnant MPs won the right to vote by proxy, and that was only after Labour\u2019s Tulip Siddiq arrived in a wheelchair on the day she was due to give birth. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t ram raid things through, but really, it\u2019s kind of glacial, the pace of change.\u201d</p> <p>Worse still, some now fear progress shifting into reverse, thanks to a tide of threats and abuse disproportionately targeted at female, black and gay politicians and seemingly designed to intimidate them out of public life.</p> <p>\u201cWomen speaking up is like a red rag to the misogynist bull,\u201d sighs Harman. \u201cThat\u2019s what the response to the significant advance of women in parliament has been; a significant backlash together with social media enabling anonymous threats and abuse.\u201d She doesn\u2019t see it putting Labour women off standing for parliament, but worries that \u201cpeople stand down earlier than they might because of that\u201d.</p> <p>And latterly, such abuse hasn\u2019t always come from outside the party. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/07/four-female-labour-mps-hit-with-deselection-threats\" title=\"\">Female and ethnic minority MPs have been disproportionately targeted</a> so far in the trigger ballots <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/17/labour-trigger-ballot-deselection-campaign\" title=\"\">allowing local party members to seek to replace their candidates</a>, just as women warned would happen when Corbyn changed the rules. Lucy Powell, the Manchester Central MP, has argued the process has become in parts about \u201ctrying to put a lid on opinionated, outspoken women\u201d; in South Shields, Emma Lewell-Buck has raised allegations of b<a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-10-22/exclusive-labour-mp-emma-lewell-buck-launches-appeal-against-de-selection/\" title=\"\">ullying and harassment within the local party</a>.</p> <p>Harman argues the threshold for deselection was set too low. A reselection contest can now be triggered if 30% of constituency branches want one, meaning in practice that an MP\u2019s fate can be dictated by a handful of aggrieved people \u2013 and needs reviewing. But if it were just about a technically flawed process, men would surely be affected as much as women? \u201cCertainly, some women have said: \u2018I got selected on an all-women shortlist, there were some people in the party who have never accepted there being an all-women shortlist, have always resented me and have seen this as their opportunity not necessarily to get rid of me but to give me a hard time,\u2019\u201d she says. While trigger ballots are still at an early stage, she cautions: \u201cObviously, the process is flawed and whatever the intention of it was, it\u2019s not fulfilling the intention.\u201d</p> <p>Like many Labour MPs, Harman expressed dismay when Louise Ellman, the Jewish Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside who had faced a long and vitriolic campaign to oust her, resigned the whip, saying Labour was \u201cno longer a safe place for Jews\u201d. (Ellman\u2019s critics accuse her of jumping before she could be deselected. That isn\u2019t true, Harman insists; she was tipped to survive the trigger ballot process.) So what, apart from issuing anguished statements of regret, are MPs like Harman going to do about tackling antisemitism within Labour?</p> <p>\u201cWe do need the Equalities and Human Rights Commission [EHRC, now running a formal inquiry into antisemitism in the party] to bring forward its report ASAP because that will provide the imperative for change that\u2019s needed, and end the situation where people are accusing those who have been victims of antisemitism of confected concerns,\u201d says Harman. \u201cI think [publication of the EHRC report] is the point at which we will [enact] the long-overdue change.\u201d</p> <p>Shouldn\u2019t Corbyn take some personal responsibility for what is erupting within his party? Harman chooses her words carefully: \u201cI think the thing about leadership is that it\u2019s your responsibility not just to have the right position, but to ensure that it\u2019s the position of the party as a whole. That\u2019s not just about saying: \u2018I\u2019m totally opposed to antisemitism, I do not condone it, I\u2019ve never engaged in it.\u2019 Leadership is about making sure that wherever it shows itself, it\u2019s absolutely stamped down on. I think that has been the problem.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to respect and support the autonomy of the members and that\u2019s a role of leadership, but it\u2019s also a role of leadership that if members are doing something which is egregiously wrong, you clamp down on it. You have got to be tough and directive to be an effective leader as well as supportive of your grassroots.\u201d</p> <p>Even such veiled criticism is significant because, unlike many of her old political allies, Harman has remained publicly loyal to each successive Labour leader, whatever her private misgivings. (She declined to serve on Corbyn\u2019s frontbench, arguing that she had had her turn, but her husband, the MP Jack Dromey, does.) She takes a broadly stoical view of the current turmoil, having lived through Neil Kinnock\u2019s struggle with the hard left when Labour councillors going into meetings were spat on by local activists. \u201cMy constituency party had to be suspended in the 80s because there were fights in general committee meetings. Someone pulled a gun at a meeting and I was like: \u2018This has really gone beyond ...\u2019 and they said: \u2018No, it was only an imitation gun,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that what\u2019s happening now should be discounted, but the party found its equilibrium after that turmoil and it will do again after all this.\u201d</p> <p>Yet in the Speaker\u2019s job she has perhaps identified a role that would lift her out of the fray, obliging her to become a neutral servant of parliament during a constitutional struggle over Brexit that transcends party lines. While critics argue she\u2019s too establishment for what became, under Bercow, a reforming and even activist role, she clearly finds the charge bizarre, having spent her life being criticised for being too radical in her feminism, only to find her causes eventually becoming mainstream.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve certainly been there a long time and stuck it out \u2013 if that\u2019s what you call establishment, surviving, definitely ... But if you\u2019ve been an outsider, a very young woman in a parliament of older men, you never ever forget the contempt with which your views were treated and you never ever forget your complete frustration that other people\u2019s views could be accepted with reverence.\u201d</p> <p>Does she feel sympathy then for Theresa May, as Tory Brexiters who snubbed her deal leap on board her male successor\u2019s version? For the first time, Harman falters. \u201cYou stand or fall by what you can achieve,\u201d she says eventually. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to, because she\u2019s a woman, make excuses ... I mean, she was the prime minister, for heaven\u2019s sake. If you can\u2019t take responsibility for your own successes and failures when you are prime minister, then when can you?\u201d</p> <p>She is more comfortable agreeing with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, that the next Labour leader should be a woman, having ducked out of running for the job herself in the past. \u201cI do remember people saying, when I was acting leader: \u2018Why aren\u2019t you going for the real thing?\u2019 but I sort of treated it as if they were being polite. I wasn\u2019t quite convinced they really meant it.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, at 69, she sees herself as part of a wave of older women refusing to leave the workplace quietly. \u201cThere are a lot of women who stepped back when their kids were younger and they\u2019re now ready to step back up, but find that, too often, people think: \u2018Oh, now you\u2019re past it,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cOne minute you\u2019re too young, the next you\u2019re too old, whereas with men they\u2019re always in their prime.\u201d</p> <p>Yet with age, she thinks, comes at least one consolation. \u201cIf people have just got used to you, they\u2019ll deal with what you say at face value, and that gives you opportunities to do things that you wouldn\u2019t have been able to before ... A lot of them were scared of me when I first arrived; for good or ill, I don\u2019t frighten them any more.\u201d She grins. \u201cI\u2019ve obviously got to up my game.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is the end of yet another momentous week in parliament and Harriet Harman\u2019s kitchen is a picture of cheery domestic chaos. Her two beloved cats are climbing the curtains, there is a pile of washing waiting and Holly, her young granddaughter, who is currently staying, toddles in and out. Harman apologises for the mess, but is clearly rather enjoying having a highchair at the table again. It is 37 years since she arrived in Westminster, heavily pregnant and feeling like a \u201cfish out of water\u201d, as she described it. Male Tory MPs would shout \u201cstupid cow\u201d at her across the chamber, while the things she longed to debate \u2013 such as her south London constituents\u2019 struggle to find childcare while they worked, or feminist reforms she had taken up as a young lawyer \u2013 were deemed trivial. At her lowest ebb \u2013 contracting pneumonia while exhausted from juggling an opposition frontbench job and small children \u2013 she considered quitting. But instead she rose to the cabinet under Tony Blair, served as caretaker Labour leader after Ed Miliband left and is now running to succeed John Bercow as Speaker of the House of Commons when he retires next month, on a platform of putting parliament back in touch with the public that it serves. Leafing through her notes from the mini listening tour she has undertaken, asking people around the country what they think of parliament, underlines how difficult that has become. Westminster politics is seen as aggressive, entitled, phoney and unprofessional, a braying bear pit hopelessly out of step with modern workplaces, where respect and empathy are increasingly valued. \u201cOne woman said: \u2018I\u2019m a trade union negotiator. I\u2019d get nowhere if I walked into a negotiation and behaved like that,\u2019\u201d Harman recalls. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s been very striking is that people think the anger that\u2019s displayed in parliament is an artefact, that it\u2019s basically fake, playing up to the cameras.

And latterly, such abuse hasn\u2019t always come from outside the party. Female and ethnic minority MPs have been disproportionately targeted so far in the trigger ballots allowing local party members to seek to replace their candidates, just as women warned would happen when Corbyn changed the rules. Lucy Powell, the Manchester Central MP, has argued the process has become in parts about \u201ctrying to put a lid on opinionated, outspoken women\u201d; in South Shields, Emma Lewell-Buck has raised allegations of bullying and harassment within the local party. Harman argues the threshold for deselection was set too low. A reselection contest can now be triggered if 30% of constituency branches want one, meaning in practice that an MP\u2019s fate can be dictated by a handful of aggrieved people \u2013 and needs reviewing.

I wasn\u2019t quite convinced they really meant it.\u201d Instead, at 69, she sees herself as part of a wave of older women refusing to leave the workplace quietly. \u201cThere are a lot of women who stepped back when their kids were younger and they\u2019re now ready to step back up, but find that, too often, people think: \u2018Oh, now you\u2019re past it,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cOne minute you\u2019re too young, the next you\u2019re too old, whereas with men they\u2019re always in their prime.\u201d Yet with age, she thinks, comes at least one consolation. \u201cIf people have just got used to you, they\u2019ll deal with what you say at face value, and that gives you opportunities to do things that you wouldn\u2019t have been able to before ... A lot of them were scared of me when I first arrived; for good or ill, I don\u2019t frighten them any more.\u201d She grins. \u201cI\u2019ve obviously got to up my game.\u201d",

For sheer spectacle, Republicans will be hard-pressed to top an invasion last week by lawmakers of the secure area where witnesses were being questioned. And for sheer malice, Donald Trump will have to sink far indeed to go lower than his claim to be the victim of a lynching. Republican senators have been scurrying away from reporters trying to ask about testimony last Tuesday that advanced the central charge in the impeachment inquiry, that the Trump administration had withheld military aid for Ukraine in an extortionate effort to manufacture bad news about Joe Biden. What could the senators say? Trump\u2019s defenders have almost universally stopped trying to deny or defend his conduct, resorting instead to complaints about how Democrats, who are going by rules written by Republicans, were running the process.

Trump has also continued to make highly controversial moves \u2013 abandoning the Kurds in northern Syria, temporarily awarding himself federal contracts to host next year\u2019s G7 summit \u2013 that Republicans warned made defending him increasingly difficult.

The idea was then to leverage its reach to name its terms and prices. But despite investors\u2019 indulgence of loss-making ventures that promise enormous future profits, WeWork tested that tolerance with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-not-close-to-profitable-loses-hundreds-thousands-every-hour-2019-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">a loss of $219,000 (\u00a3171,000) every hour</a> while failing to reach ubiquity fast enough. What WeWork was offering \u2013 workspaces and hot desks for the urban freelance \u2013 was not, to use the jargon of such companies\u2019 own marketing, sufficiently \u201cgame changing\u201d.</p> <p>Adam Neumann, WeWork\u2019s now ejected founder, is making off with <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/wework-founder-adam-neumann-gets-1-7-billion-payoff-to-leave-company-he-tanked-1.8018074\" title=\"\">a $1.7bn reward</a> for failing to achieve his vision and appearing to lose investors eye-watering sums of money. As with most tales of financial hubris and reckless over-expansion, the architect absconds with the spoils while the company\u2019s employees pay the price. About 4,000 WeWorkers are expected to be fired. Their new chairman told them they were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/10/24/20929236/wework-layoffs-adam-neumann-marcelo-claure\" title=\"\">taking one for the team</a>\u201d \u2013 one of the lesser-known features of the market\u2019s invisible hand.</p> <p>Neumann was a unicorn founder out of central casting. He is a long-haired messianic hyper-connected bro, whose rather basic business idea was propped up by a talent for raising money and the networks needed to do so. (His wife, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/rebekah-paltrow-neumann-wework-wegrow-former-actress-2019-8?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">Rebekah, is Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s cousin</a>.) But the crisis at WeWork isn\u2019t just one more bursting-bubble tale fronted by another Steve Jobs wannabe: it exemplifies the increasing volatility of the economic model that inflated the unicorns of the past. And it involves three trends that underpin the growth of enterprises looking to make money by catering to the modern workforce: the expansion of the gig economy, the relatively low cost of commercial real estate, and the increase in financial flows from sovereign investors in search of political capital.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The WeWork debacle should be an indictment of the character of contemporary finance capitalism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What sets WeWork apart is that it is a company built on the rubble of the financial crisis. Its customers are largely drawn from the precariat \u2013 workers who no longer expect to find permanent jobs and so instead become full-time gig-economy labourers. The financial crash, combined with the sophistication of remote working solutions, meant that employers were able to create two tiers of labour: full time with full benefits for their most profitable workers; and task-specific gig contracts, without pension or paid leave, for everyone else. Even the cost of the physical space, the ground rent required to house employees, can now be passed on to workers, who pay to rent their own desks in co-working spaces.</p> <p>This is where WeWork comes into the picture: providing offices to house these satellite employees, and giving them a sense of belonging in their satellite workplace. WeWork buildings have canteens, free coffee stations, an engineered sense of camaraderie and community. Like<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/japans-rent-a-family-industry\" title=\"\"> the Japanese rent-a-family industry,</a> WeWork will sell you the love and warmth of an employer when your real employer is absent, or short of affection.</p> <p>The aftermath of the financial crisis also made it easy for WeWork to buy and lease cheap commercial property as a result of a real-estate market crash followed by low interest rates \u2013 enabling it to become the largest private-sector tenant in New York and London. Its unravelling is already rattling property markets in the US, the UK and Ireland.</p> <p>Investments that pumped up WeWork embodied another post-crisis trend \u2013 financial adventurism as a geopolitical tool. WeWork\u2019s largest backer, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/softbank-backers-rethink-role-in-next-vision-fund-after-wework\" title=\"\">Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund</a>, is largely funded by money from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. This is what analysts call dumb money: huge investments in high-profile tech companies such as Uber, Slack and DoorDash, with the aim of multiplying political clout rather than financial returns, at a time when economic power is shifting from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. Saudi investments buy more than allies in Washington: lavishing money on Silicon Valley helps crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to land soft interviews in the western press and cosy chats with the titans of tech.</p> <p>The WeWork debacle should be an indictment of the character of contemporary finance capitalism \u2013 but it is almost certain to become another unremarkable instalment in the folklore of modern business, another natural disaster that wrecked thousands of lives and careers before the market moved on to its next unicorn. Nothing will change, and there will be no introspection. And it will happen again soon, because late capitalism is sustained by the myth that spectacular implosions like this one are acts of God \u2013 when they are entirely man-made.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The latest tech financial calamity is WeWork, an office space and \u201cworkplace solutions\u201d operator that is now shrinking rapidly, after a planned initial public offering (IPO) was scrapped when potential investors rejected its absurd $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) valuation. WeWork\u2019s collapse is a business-school study in the excesses of private capital in an unregulated market that fetishises the wealth-creating genius of the lone pioneer. WeWork\u2019s strategy wasn\u2019t simply to fulfil a practical need: its aim was market domination, to be achieved by undercutting its competitors in a race to the bottom, using investor capital as oxygen to sustain losses while other serviced office-space providers ran out of breath and expired. The idea was then to leverage its reach to name its terms and prices. But despite investors\u2019 indulgence of loss-making ventures that promise enormous future profits, WeWork tested that tolerance with a loss of $219,000 (\u00a3171,000) every hour while failing to reach ubiquity fast enough. What WeWork was offering \u2013 workspaces and hot desks for the urban freelance \u2013 was not, to use the jargon of such companies\u2019 own marketing, sufficiently \u201cgame changing\u201d. Adam Neumann, WeWork\u2019s now ejected founder, is making off with a $1.7bn reward for failing to achieve his vision and appearing to lose investors eye-watering sums of money. As with most tales of financial hubris and reckless over-expansion, the architect absconds with the spoils while the company\u2019s employees pay the price. About 4,000 WeWorkers are expected to be fired. Their new chairman told them they were \u201ctaking one for the team\u201d \u2013 one of the lesser-known features of the market\u2019s invisible hand. Neumann was a unicorn founder out of central casting. He is a long-haired messianic hyper-connected bro, whose rather basic business idea was propped up by a talent for raising money and the networks needed to do so. (His wife, Rebekah, is Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s cousin.) But the crisis at WeWork isn\u2019t just one more bursting-bubble tale fronted by another Steve Jobs wannabe: it exemplifies the increasing volatility of the economic model that inflated the unicorns of the past. And it involves three trends that underpin the growth of enterprises looking to make money by catering to the modern workforce: the expansion of the gig economy, the relatively low cost of commercial real estate, and the increase in financial flows from sovereign investors in search of political capital. What sets WeWork apart is that it is a company built on the rubble of the financial crisis. Its customers are largely drawn from the precariat \u2013 workers who no longer expect to find permanent jobs and so instead become full-time gig-economy labourers. The financial crash, combined with the sophistication of remote working solutions, meant that employers were able to create two tiers of labour: full time with full benefits for their most profitable workers; and task-specific gig contracts, without pension or paid leave, for everyone else. Even the cost of the physical space, the ground rent required to house employees, can now be passed on to workers, who pay to rent their own desks in co-working spaces. This is where WeWork comes into the picture: providing offices to house these satellite employees, and giving them a sense of belonging in their satellite workplace. WeWork buildings have canteens, free coffee stations, an engineered sense of camaraderie and community. Like the Japanese rent-a-family industry, WeWork will sell you the love and warmth of an employer when your real employer is absent, or short of affection. The aftermath of the financial crisis also made it easy for WeWork to buy and lease cheap commercial property as a result of a real-estate market crash followed by low interest rates \u2013 enabling it to become the largest private-sector tenant in New York and London. Its unravelling is already rattling property markets in the US, the UK and Ireland. Investments that pumped up WeWork embodied another post-crisis trend \u2013 financial adventurism as a geopolitical tool. WeWork\u2019s largest backer, Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund, is largely funded by money from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. This is what analysts call dumb money: huge investments in high-profile tech companies such as Uber, Slack and DoorDash, with the aim of multiplying political clout rather than financial returns, at a time when economic power is shifting from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. Saudi investments buy more than allies in Washington: lavishing money on Silicon Valley helps crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to land soft interviews in the western press and cosy chats with the titans of tech. The WeWork debacle should be an indictment of the character of contemporary finance capitalism \u2013 but it is almost certain to become another unremarkable instalment in the folklore of modern business, another natural disaster that wrecked thousands of lives and careers before the market moved on to its next unicorn. Nothing will change, and there will be no introspection. And it will happen again soon, because late capitalism is sustained by the myth that spectacular implosions like this one are acts of God \u2013 when they are entirely man-made. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The EU is preparing to sign off on a Brexit extension to 31 January 2020 with an option for the UK to leave earlier if a deal is ratified, according to a leaked draft of the agreement seen by the Guardian. After earlier objections raised by the French government, a paper to be agreed on Monday circulated among member states suggests the EU will accede to the UK\u2019s request for a further delay. The UK would be able to leave on the first day of the month after a deal is ratified, according to the paper. A source close to Emmanuel Macron said an agreement between the EU27 on the new Brexit extension would \u201cvery probably\u201d be announced on Monday morning following political discussions with London over the weekend, notably a conversation between the French president and Boris Johnson. The draft paper suggests a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is off the table as demanded by opposition party leaders as a prerequisite for a general election. Until there is official signoff on the agreement, there remains the possibility that the terms could change, but it is the first time firm dates have been written into an official document. \u201cThe period provided for in article 50 (3) TEU as extended by the European council decision (EU) 2019/584 is hereby further extended until 31 January 2020,\u201d the draft agreement says. \u201cIn the event that the parties to that agreement complete their respective ratification procedures and notify the depositary of the completion of these procedures in November 2019, in December 2019 or in January 2020, the withdrawal agreement will enter into into force respectively on [the first of the month of the relevant month].\u201d The potential date of 15 November for the UK to leave the EU \u2013 an idea raised by France \u2013 is not included in the draft paper. An EU declaration attached to the draft agreement stipulates that the bloc will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. It is also says the UK has \u201can obligation\u201d to nominate a candidate to join the European commission. The prime minister has previously said he will not put forward a nominee. The European council president, Donald Tusk, has been in intensive discussions with EU leaders over the weekend. Ambassadors for the EU27 are meeting on Monday morning. Tusk had said he wanted to avoid calling leaders to a summit in Brussels to discuss the issue and would seek to find unanimous agreement to allow sign-off via a \u201cwritten procedure\u201d. The circulation of the draft agreement suggested Tusk had been successful in convincing France, in particular, that a three-month extension avoids the EU being dragged into the domestic row in the UK. Among weekend developments that had persuaded Paris to drop its objections to a new delay lasting up to three months was \u201cthe significantly more likely prospect of fresh elections, now backed by several parties including the Liberal Democrats and the SNP\u201d, the French official said. The conditions attached to the extension had also been \u201cfurther specified and reinforced\u201d on Saturday and Sunday, the source added, in particular the \u201cnon-renegotiability\u201d of the deal and the fact that the 27 will be able to work on the bloc\u2019s future plans without the UK. While wishing to preserve the unity of the 27 that had been their guiding principle throughout the negotiations, the source said, Paris had \u201cinsisted on these conditions as necessary\u201d. The terms in the draft agreement are in line with those stipulated under the Benn act that forced Boris Johnson to make a request to the EU for a further delay. The extension had been due to be signed off on Friday. But the French ambassador had stood alone at a meeting of EU diplomats in arguing it was not the right time. It was suggested by France\u2019s ambassador that only after the vote on Monday should the EU decide to \u201cgo short, to push for ratification, or long to accommodate a general election\u201d. Only France insisted the EU wait on agreeing to an extension. Since then, Johnson told the cabinet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had informed him he was too isolated to insist on a shorter extension. Developments over the weekend, in which the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party agreed to table a one-line bill in which they would back a general election on 9 December, have convinced many EU officials the UK will soon go to the polls. Downing Street has let it be known that if Labour does not support its plan for an short extra period of scrutiny of the withdrawal agreement bill up to 6 November, and then a general election on 12 December, it will look at the joint proposal.",

That result meant PNG, who topped their qualifying pool heading into the final day of group stage matches in the UAE, booked their place at October\u2019s tournament in Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/27/australia-v-sri-lanka-first-twenty20-international-live\">Australia thrash Sri Lanka by 134 runs in first Twenty20 international</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Victory over Kenya did not come easy, and PNG made life tough for themselves by falling to a potentially disastrous 19-6 inside four overs. But Norman Vanua came to the crease and dug in for a 48-ball 54 to steady the ship and guide his team to 118 off 19.3 overs. In response, Kenya could make only 73 from 18.4 overs, as PNG captain Assad Vala took three wickets for just seven runs, and Nosaina Pokana 3-21.</p> <p>In the later game, the Netherlands beat Scotland by four wickets, but failed to win inside 12.3 overs and as such could not topple PNG from top spot in the group on net run rate \u2013 nor snatch the one automatic World Cup qualification spot on offer.</p> <p>It caps a roller-coaster few years for PNG, who lost their one-day international and T20I status with the ICC in March 2018, and did not reclaim them until April this year. Coach Joe Dawes, the former Queensland fast bowler, admitted his team was a \u201clittle emotional\u201d after qualification was confirmed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty big two years with what the boys have been through,\u201d Dawes said. \u201cFor them to achieve this is pretty special.

It\u2019s been a challenge with the education, language and facilities and bits and pieces. We\u2019ve got some work to do in 50-over cricket but we knew Twenty20 was our format. To come here and achieve this is a dream come true.\u201d</p> <p>Captain Assad Vala said: \u201cWords can\u2019t express how we\u2019re feeling at the moment. We worked really hard to go where we are. We came in with not good form but our play all throughout the week has been outstanding.\u201d</p> <p>Ireland also booked their place at next year\u2019s tournament, but Namibia, UAE, Oman, and Hong Kong will join Scotland and the Netherlands in the playoffs, where four remaining spots in Australia are still to be won.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Papua New Guinea\u2019s men\u2019s team have never played at a major International Cricket Council tournament, in any format of the game, but that will change next year after the Pacific island nation secured qualification for the 2020 Twenty20 World Cup in thrilling fashion. History was made at a qualifying tournament after the Barramundis first beat Kenya by 45 runs at the Dubai International Stadium and then watched from the stands as the Netherlands, crucially, faltered against Scotland. That result meant PNG, who topped their qualifying pool heading into the final day of group stage matches in the UAE, booked their place at October\u2019s tournament in Australia. Victory over Kenya did not come easy, and PNG made life tough for themselves by falling to a potentially disastrous 19-6 inside four overs. But Norman Vanua came to the crease and dug in for a 48-ball 54 to steady the ship and guide his team to 118 off 19.3 overs. In response, Kenya could make only 73 from 18.4 overs, as PNG captain Assad Vala took three wickets for just seven runs, and Nosaina Pokana 3-21. In the later game, the Netherlands beat Scotland by four wickets, but failed to win inside 12.3 overs and as such could not topple PNG from top spot in the group on net run rate \u2013 nor snatch the one automatic World Cup qualification spot on offer. It caps a roller-coaster few years for PNG, who lost their one-day international and T20I status with the ICC in March 2018, and did not reclaim them until April this year. Coach Joe Dawes, the former Queensland fast bowler, admitted his team was a \u201clittle emotional\u201d after qualification was confirmed. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty big two years with what the boys have been through,\u201d Dawes said. \u201cFor them to achieve this is pretty special. The boys and PNG Cricket have had an interesting year and for them to achieve this is a great thing for us and for the nation, and for all the staff back at home who didn\u2019t make the trip. \u201cThe boys have bought into what we try to do. It\u2019s been a challenge with the education, language and facilities and bits and pieces. We\u2019ve got some work to do in 50-over cricket but we knew Twenty20 was our format. To come here and achieve this is a dream come true.\u201d Captain Assad Vala said: \u201cWords can\u2019t express how we\u2019re feeling at the moment. We worked really hard to go where we are. We came in with not good form but our play all throughout the week has been outstanding.\u201d Ireland also booked their place at next year\u2019s tournament, but Namibia, UAE, Oman, and Hong Kong will join Scotland and the Netherlands in the playoffs, where four remaining spots in Australia are still to be won.",

      "bodyText": "Fortnightly collections of food and garden waste in Victoria would cost the state more than half a billion dollars over the next four years, a parliamentary budget office costing for the Greens has revealed. As the state searches for ways to tackle an ongoing waste and recycling crisis, the Greens party has called on the state Labor government to consider providing a fortnightly collection service for food and other green waste. According to an Infrastructure Victoria report last week around 35% of the weight of household bins was food and other organic waste. Dozens of councils in Victoria are experimenting with food-waste recycling, most recently with Darebin council charging people who want a green 120-litre bin just over $50 per year to collect organic waste fortnightly. To extend the program across the whole state \u2013 and cover the cost for the service and the need for new waste-processing centres \u2013 would set the state back $514.7m, according to the Victorian parliamentary budget office, out to 2022-23. Providing bins, operating expenses, and the new waste-processing facilities accounts for $451.2m of this cost, while the office said there would be a $63.5m decline in the landfill levy due to less waste ending up in landfill.

She went on to make appearances in a wide array of Australia\u2019s most well-known television shows, including Matlock Police, A Country Practice, The Flying Doctors, and more. Phelan had a prolific stage career, performing in more than 50 productions with major Australian theatre companies including Melbourne Theatre Company, Queensland Theatre, and Playbox. In film, Phelan was widely lauded for her performances in the screen adaptations of Ruth Park\u2019s seminal novels, The Harp in the South and Poor Man\u2019s Orange. Phelan received nominations and awards from the Australian Film Institute and the Television Society of Australia\u2019s Penguin awards for her performance as Mumma Darcy. She featured in a handful of other Australian films, most recently in the Michelle Payne biopic Ride Like a Girl. Phelan\u2019s agent at BGM, Marea Jablonski, said in statement that Phelan\u2019s health had \u201conly recently\u201d taken \u201ca very sudden turn for the worst\u201d. \u201cShe had an incredible ability to create very true characters,\u201d Jablonski said. Phelan won a Green Room award for best supporting actress for her turn as Rachael in Melbourne Theatre Company\u2019s production of Season\u2019s Greetings. She also won two best actress awards from the Television Society of Australia for her work on Prisoner. In 2000, Phelan was the recipient of an AFI best actress award for her role in the drama series Something in the Air, alongside Eric Bana and later Vince Colosimo. Phelan was a long-time member of the performing arts union and in 2016, won the equity lifetime achievement award presented by the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance. She was also a committed member of Actors for Refugees and supporter of Positive Women, which supports women living with HIV, and received awards for her community activism. In 2007, Phelan was awarded an Order of Australia for service to the arts and the community.",

      "body": "<p>Still reeling from the collapse of Thomas Cook, Spain\u2019s tourist industry is now counting the cost of prolonged rioting in Barcelona, the nation\u2019s most popular urban destination.</p> <p>A week of violent and destructive disturbances over the jailing of Catalan political leaders left the city with a clean-up bill estimated at \u20ac3m but it is feared that the images of airport chaos, running battles with police and flaming barricades will cost the city a great deal more.</p> <p>The tourism association Barcelona Oberta estimates that economic activity in the city centre \u2013 principally the retail and hospitality sectors \u2013 fell by between 30-50% during the week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/catalan-separatist-leaders-given-lengthy-prison-sentences\">the sentences were announced on 14 October</a>, either because clients stayed away to avoid being caught up in the violence or because establishments closed for fear of damage or looting.</p> <p>Roger Pallarols, president of the Barcelona restaurateurs association, said that in the areas directly affected by the disturbances trade fell by about 60%. Some 70 restaurants also had their outdoor terraces destroyed as rioters burned chairs and parasols on the barricades, causing around \u20ac2m in damage to property.</p> <p>\u201cLast week was a lost week from the point of view of restaurateurs,\u201d Pallarols said. \u201cThings are quiet now but if this continues restaurants will have to lay off staff because the profit margins are very small.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the worst rioting was in Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, the city\u2019s upmarket shopping street, where around 60% of sales are to tourists.</p> <p>\u201cSales were down around 30% over the week,\u201d said Luis Sans, president of the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia association. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a return to normality now but the short term is one thing, another is the effect these images will have had on people\u2019s desire to come to Barcelona. </p> <p>\u201cThere was a lot of damage but at least, unlike the gilets jaunes in Paris, the demonstrators didn\u2019t set out to destroy shops and restaurants.\u201d</p> <p>Manel Casals, head of the Barcelona hoteliers association, said there have been cancellations but relatively few, although he has no figures as yet. \u201cWhat we are seeing is fewer people are making reservations than is normal at this time of year.\u201d</p> <p>The same is happening with Airbnb and other holiday apartment platforms. According AirDNA, which analyses the short-term rental market, reservations for the week from 14 October, when the protests began, were down by nearly 1,000 on the same week last year, from 12,515 to 11,537.</p> <p>Tourism accounts for 15% of Barcelona\u2019s GDP and the hotel business alone has a turnover of some \u20ac1.6bn. The tourism industry employs around 100,000 people, 40,000 of them directly.</p> <p>As well as tourism, Barcelona is one of the world\u2019s favourite conference venues. There are conferences every day of the week but the real money-spinner is the Mobile World Conference. Last year the 100,000 visitors to the congress spent \u20ac473m while creating 14,000 temporary jobs. The current contract with the city expires in 2023.</p> <p>\u201cConferences are organised a long way in advance and aside from an American convention I don\u2019t know of any cancellations,\u201d said Christoph Tessmar, director of the Barcelona Tourism Convention Bureau. \u201cIn recent years Barcelona has had to confront major crises but has maintained its position as a world leader for conferences, although the images we\u2019ve seen in recent days could have a negative impact in the short term.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f668b81cfab99b8795c261bee938935ac1945fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f668b81cfab99b8795c261bee938935ac1945fa/0_98_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police stand-off with protesters in Barcelona last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A police stand-off with protesters in Barcelona last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barcelona is also the cruise capital of the Mediterranean. At least three cruise ships carrying a total of 6,000 passengers opted not to dock in the city during the disturbances.

      "bodyText": "Still reeling from the collapse of Thomas Cook, Spain\u2019s tourist industry is now counting the cost of prolonged rioting in Barcelona, the nation\u2019s most popular urban destination. A week of violent and destructive disturbances over the jailing of Catalan political leaders left the city with a clean-up bill estimated at \u20ac3m but it is feared that the images of airport chaos, running battles with police and flaming barricades will cost the city a great deal more. The tourism association Barcelona Oberta estimates that economic activity in the city centre \u2013 principally the retail and hospitality sectors \u2013 fell by between 30-50% during the week after the sentences were announced on 14 October, either because clients stayed away to avoid being caught up in the violence or because establishments closed for fear of damage or looting. Roger Pallarols, president of the Barcelona restaurateurs association, said that in the areas directly affected by the disturbances trade fell by about 60%. Some 70 restaurants also had their outdoor terraces destroyed as rioters burned chairs and parasols on the barricades, causing around \u20ac2m in damage to property. \u201cLast week was a lost week from the point of view of restaurateurs,\u201d Pallarols said. \u201cThings are quiet now but if this continues restaurants will have to lay off staff because the profit margins are very small.\u201d Some of the worst rioting was in Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, the city\u2019s upmarket shopping street, where around 60% of sales are to tourists. \u201cSales were down around 30% over the week,\u201d said Luis Sans, president of the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia association. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a return to normality now but the short term is one thing, another is the effect these images will have had on people\u2019s desire to come to Barcelona. \u201cThere was a lot of damage but at least, unlike the gilets jaunes in Paris, the demonstrators didn\u2019t set out to destroy shops and restaurants.\u201d Manel Casals, head of the Barcelona hoteliers association, said there have been cancellations but relatively few, although he has no figures as yet. \u201cWhat we are seeing is fewer people are making reservations than is normal at this time of year.\u201d The same is happening with Airbnb and other holiday apartment platforms. According AirDNA, which analyses the short-term rental market, reservations for the week from 14 October, when the protests began, were down by nearly 1,000 on the same week last year, from 12,515 to 11,537. Tourism accounts for 15% of Barcelona\u2019s GDP and the hotel business alone has a turnover of some \u20ac1.6bn. The tourism industry employs around 100,000 people, 40,000 of them directly. As well as tourism, Barcelona is one of the world\u2019s favourite conference venues. There are conferences every day of the week but the real money-spinner is the Mobile World Conference. Last year the 100,000 visitors to the congress spent \u20ac473m while creating 14,000 temporary jobs. The current contract with the city expires in 2023. \u201cConferences are organised a long way in advance and aside from an American convention I don\u2019t know of any cancellations,\u201d said Christoph Tessmar, director of the Barcelona Tourism Convention Bureau. \u201cIn recent years Barcelona has had to confront major crises but has maintained its position as a world leader for conferences, although the images we\u2019ve seen in recent days could have a negative impact in the short term.\u201d Barcelona is also the cruise capital of the Mediterranean. At least three cruise ships carrying a total of 6,000 passengers opted not to dock in the city during the disturbances. However, the financial impact will have been felt more by the port authorities than the city as cruise passengers spend little when they go ashore. According to the government, ports, railways and airports between them have lost about \u20ac4m as a result of the protests. Altogether, around 175,000 travellers were affected either by cancellations or delays caused by road blocks. For now, everyone is banking on Barcelona\u2019s famed capacity for resilience. During the crisis in 2017, when the city was rocked by both a terrorist attack and the illegal declaration of independence, thousands of businesses moved their headquarters out of Catalonia. However, the city bounced back and Sans believes that the political uncertainty in 2017 made the situation worse than it is now. \u201cThese events can damage the city\u2019s image but this conflict isn\u2019t going to continue forever and we\u2019ll get back to normal,\u201d said Gabriel Jen\u00e9, president of Barcelona Oberta. \u201cWe\u2019re more worried about the ability of politicians to deal with the conflict than the capacity of the city to overcome it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "With the Hawkesbury River to the north, the Royal national park to the south, and mountains and highlands to the west, you don\u2019t have to travel far from Sydney to feel like you\u2019ve escaped. When you\u2019re trapped in crawling traffic on one of the city\u2019s arterial roads, however, even short distances drag on. Free from traffic and toll roads, Sydney\u2019s local and regional train network can be pretty time- and cost-effective when it comes to skipping town. Before you attempt any day-long adventures via public transport, download the TripView app for travel times, and always check for track work. 1. For a taste of river-folk life: Dangar Island Accessible only by boat or ferry, Dangar Island on the Hawkesbury River is lush, hilly and laidback. There\u2019s a safe swimming beach, heritage-listed blackbutt trees and an Aboriginal sandstone carving at the island\u2019s highest point, Kiparra park. Best of all, the island is car-free, which means no whoosh of traffic or fear of freely meandering across the roads. The 300 or so locals use wheelbarrows to cart their things around, while the schoolchildren leave their bicycles in a shed on the pier. The island has a bohemian air, with rambling verandas, Tibetan flags and rope swings spied in its abundantly bushy backyards. On a shady, two-hour island loop you\u2019ll see the shared island buggy doing the rounds and some ingenious rigs, including rails running from the road to one local\u2019s house to lug things up. You can picnic and swim at Bradley\u2019s beach or do lunch at the island\u2019s only drinking hole, Dangar Island bowling club. The final polish on the idyllic picture is a posse of locals tending a communal vegetable garden next to the bowling green. Planted in boats, of course. Getting there: The central coast and Newcastle (CCN) train runs from Sydney\u2019s Central station to Hawkesbury River station at Brooklyn (60 minutes). The Dangar Island ferry leaves from Brooklyn (15 minutes). 2. For a walk and wild swimming: Karloo pools This 11.3 kilometre hike (roughly 4.5 hours) along the Royal national park\u2019s Uloola track ticks some rare boxes. It begins (Heathcote) and ends (Waterfall) at a train station, you can see both a waterhole and a waterfall and, in spring, it blooms with flannel flowers, purple native iris, bell-shaped native fuchsia, masses of yellow Pultenaea villosa (commonly called \u201cegg and bacon\u201d) and even a towering Gymea lily or two, found only in the Sydney basin bushland. The perennial foliage is beautiful too, with plentiful heath banksia, grevillea, bottlebrush and a stand of slim-limbed eucalypts with lustrous silver bark. We see a goanna up a tree and other lizards leaping between branches. Karloo pools are an hour\u2019s walk from Heathcote, with plenty of shade and good spots to clamber in for an icy-cold dip. Lying on the sun-warmed rocks to marvel at the water is bliss too, given that waterholes are usually stained brown by leaf tannins and are rarely so emerald and rippling lime-green. The coastal scrub intermittently clears during the walk\u2019s second half to reveal the Sydney skyline, softened by distance, like a watercolour on the horizon. The last 5km stretch along a flat fire trail and, because Waterfall is the last stop on the line, water, toilets and a seat on the train itself will be waiting on the platform. Getting there: The T4 line train runs from Central to Heathcote (50 minutes) and back from Waterfall (55 minutes). 3. For country crafts and antiquing: Mittagong The chief charms of Mittagong in the southern highlands are antiques, food, gardens and both craft and craft beer. At Australia\u2019s oldest arts and craft centre, Sturt, you can browse an all-Australian collection of elegant furniture, metalwork, ceramics, jewellery and textiles. Or just scoff scones and jam in the cafe. Mid-morning coffee is best at The Boston\u2019s ivy and stone-clad 1800s cottage, followed by Mittagong Antiques Centre, with its specialist stalls of toy cars, 1970s picnic ware, military paraphernalia, midcentury decor and every (old) thing in between. Twisting Vintage, meanwhile, is a polyester colour explosion of ladies\u2019 wear and accessories from the 60s and 70s in such mint condition it\u2019s more like a fashion museum. The Shaggy Cow melds a relaxed cafe feel with fine seasonal food that\u2019s not too salty in a room that\u2019s not too noisy. The local ros\u00e9 and riesling are terrific, though the fresh sodas are even better. Walk off lunch with a stroll to Eden Brewery, which runs on green power and donates 10% of its profits to Oxfam. All beers in its low-lit bar are $5, while takeaway growlers and squealers come in innovative stainless-steel flagons that stay cold, sans refrigeration. Your first growler (the equivalent of a six pack) is $50 but the second is just $25. Getting there: The NSW regional train from Central to Mittagong (90 minutes). 4. For low-tourist Blue Mountains views: Blackheath Feel superior as the crowds disembark at Katoomba and you head two stops further west to Blackheath \u2013 smaller in size but mightier in scenery. The Anonymous Cafe is close to the train station so fuel up on its trademark all-day breakfast and organic sourdough. Pack some pastries and a local Hillbilly apple cider (yes that\u2019s on the menu) for the 40-minute backstreets walk past Blackheath\u2019s weatherboard cottages to the national park entrance. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Clifftop Walk takes you between two of its best vantage points: Govett\u2019s Leap and Evans lookout.

We think they\u2019re in the minority and we want to reduce the number of times that that happens but we don\u2019t think an outright ban is the solution at this time.\u201d Racing Victoria announced the expanded welfare scheme in response to footage showing the alleged abuse of ex-racehorses at a Queensland abattoir, which prompted a public outcry and dual state and federal investigations of possible animal welfare breaches. The footage showed that racehorses had been sold in and sent from NSW for slaughter despite Racing NSW amending its Rules of Racing in 2017 to say that \u201cno racehorses are to be sent directly or indirectly to a slaughterhouse or knackery\u201d. The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses, which monitored the Queensland abattoir for two years, welcomed the equine welfare funding but said it fell far short of the $200m a year it estimated was required for a comprehensive retirement plan. \u201cA ban on slaughter is what should happen, but [Racing Victoria] saying it would not work is clearly saying that the industry that they profit from and prop up is not made up of people who care about horses, they care about money,\u201d a coalition spokeswoman, Kristin Leigh, said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Leigh also rebuffed Kruger\u2019s claim that the industry was not aware of the treatment of horses at abattoirs before the footage aired on the ABC, saying RV was at least aware that the number of horses going to slaughter was far above the 1% of all retired racehorse frequently cited by Racing Australia. \u201cIf we are aware the industry is aware,\u201d she said. Kruger said those industry figures were being audited. \u201cThe biggest issue is about getting that traceability and dealing with those horses once they\u2019ve been sold twice, three times down the track after they\u2019ve left the industry,\u201d Kruger said. A national compulsory horse traceability register has the backing of the racing industry and animal welfare groups and is currently the subject of a Senate inquiry. The new Victorian funding includes greater investment in the Off the Track program, which retrains and promotes ex-racehorses for other equestrian pursuits; building an extended rehoming network; launching a foster program for \u201cthoroughbreds in need\u201d; tracking retired racehorses; and introducing a humane euthanasia program so that getting a vet to euthanise a horse on-farm is seen as a viable alternative to slaughter for horses that are, for whatever reason, deemed unsuitable to be rehomed. The Victorian Racing Club, one week out from its biggest event of the year, the Melbourne Cup Carnival, also announced a new equine wellbeing fund which will put 10% of all public ticket sales to the cup carnival and 5% of annual members\u2019 subscription fees toward welfare initiatives for current and retired racehorses. \u201cRather than concentrate on our financial return we have actually given everyone the feeling, directly and materially, that they are contributing to the solution,\u201d the VRC chair, Amanda Elliott, said. Both Kruger and Elliott said they were \u201chorrified\u201d by the footage and that the animal welfare announcement was not a cynical response to negative publicity.",

It\u2019s a let down for a neutral baseball fan like myself, but how do Nats fans feel? Surely we can all safely agree that the Nats\u2019 replacement starter, Joe Ross, doesn\u2019t quite carry the cache of their sidelined ace. Yes, it was always going to be a struggle with the Nats\u2019 suddenly stymied offense facing one of Houston\u2019s aces, Gerrit Cole. Now that order is considerably taller.<br><br>\u201cHe had -- yesterday he had a little bit of spasms in his right trap and neck,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said earlier today. \u201cThey treated it. He woke up today a lot worse......he wants to be out there with his teammates.\u201d<br><br>Surely the feeling is mutual, especially when you consider that Scherzer sitting out caps off what has been 48 soul-sucking hours that have seen the sizzle siphoned off the once scorching Washington Nationals. This is a team that had arrived home like heroes, having knocked off a heavily favored Astros team in two straight games, inside their own house. They had embarrassed Houston in Game 2 and looked so good that it was challenging to imagine any way back for the AL champs.<br><br>Houston steadied themselves with a 4-1 victory on Friday, which did little to dampen the enthusiasm around the Nats. That\u2019s because Houston was turning out a virtually unknown bullpen arm named Jose Urquidy to start Game 4. If momentum is the next day\u2019s starting pitcher, then fans in DC had nothing to worry about. </p> <p>Then Urquidy threw five shut out innings and Washington were torched 8-1. Suddenly there was plenty to worry about, and especially so with Scherzer sitting in the dugout.<br></p> <p>What do the Nats do now? They seek inspiration from Urquidy himself, the hurler who proved that momentum is NOT the next day\u2019s starting pitcher.</p> <p> If Urquidy can do it, so can Ross, must be the thinking. So what if Ross once had an ERA over 9.00 this season. This is the very same Ross who pitched in exactly one game this postseason, and it came in Game 2 where he threw two scoreless innings. <br></p> <p>So, chin up Washington. </p> <p>Can these Nats muster up what is essentially a must-win in what is their final 2019 game at home? Or will Houston head home with a Tuesday night coronation in mind? </p> <p>All shall be revealed as we get set for Game 5 of the World Series! How will it end? Drop me a twee and let me know <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lengeldavid\">@LengelDavid</a></p> <p>Stand by for live coverage - stick with us!<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db5a8278f08142786c515ec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-27T14:23:37.593Z\">2.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s what happened in Game 4:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Alex Bregman broke loose on Saturday night, putting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/houston-astros\">Houston Astros</a>ahead with an RBI single in the first inning before launching a grand slam in the seventh to lead an 8-1 romp over Washington in Game 4 of the World Series. Holding his bat high, Bregman took a half-dozen steps down the first-base line, watching his game-breaking slam sail over the fences. He added a late single for good measure as the Astros pulled even in the series, 2-2.</p> <p>A day earlier, the regular season MVP candidate was hitless in five-bats, stranding six runners and plunging him to 1 for 13 in the Series. Bregman wasn\u2019t daunted and showed why he\u2019s among the most self-assured players in baseball.</p> <p>Bregman said he felt good swings coming. Asked about his teammate, Michael Brantley echoed that. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about Alex,\u201d Brantley said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/26/world-series-game-3-astros-nationals\">after a 4-1 win on Friday night</a>. \u201cHe\u2019ll find his breaks. I can\u2019t wait to see him come out tomorrow, I\u2019m ready. You be ready, too.\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take long: Bregman pounced on the first pitch he saw, and the Astros led the rest of the way. Bregman delivered in a ballpark where he\u2019s had success, and in a city where his family has a legacy.</p> <p>Last year, Bregman\u2019s leadoff home run in the 10th inning at Nationals Park sent the American League to an 8-6 win and earned him the All-Star Game MVP award. A half-century ago, his grandfather was general counsel for the Washington Senators, the team that moved to become the Texas Rangers for the 1971 season, leaving the nation\u2019s capital without the national pastime until the Montreal Expos came in 2005.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Read all about it... Three days, three runs scored, three losses. The Nats came home thinking title, now they head back to Houston thinking survival. Get to a Game 7, get to Max Scherzer: that\u2019s the only mission for Stephen Strasburg, who will take the ball for Washington on Tuesday night. We\u2019ll be there, live, as Houston tries to wrap up a title for the second time in three years. We\u2019ll see you then, but for now, where ever you are, thanks for following with us, and good morning, good afternoon or good night. Kendrick bounces out to third and the ballgame is over! A dramatic turn of events is complete at Nationals Park! Astros 7-1 Nationals, bottom 9th Pressly gets Howie Kendrick down two strikes and now the Nats are down to their final strike. Astros 7-1 Nationals, bottom 9th Here\u2019s Soto. Check swing...did he go? Yes he did, and the Nats are down to their final out. Astros 7-1 Nationals, bottom 9th Rendon lines to right. One down. Astros 7-1 Nationals, top 9th Altuve pops out to center. Inning over. Pressly will come in to close out this pathetic three-game showing from the Nats. Well that\u2019s not coming back, unless it lands in the Wrigley Field bleachers, next year, and one of their faithful throws it back to DC. George Springer completely crushes that ball deep out into the left field night, and in case there was any doubt, there\u2019s none now. Martinez is out to make a change. It\u2019ll be Wander Suero...? Astros 5-1 Nationals, top 9th Kyle Tucker chases high heat and goes down on strikes. Now a tougher opponent: George Springer. Astros 5-1 Nationals, top 9th Maldonado laces a Hudson fastball to left for a one-out base hit. Now Kyle Tucker pinch hits for Joe Smith. Astros 5-1 Nationals, top 9th Hudson stays in the game to face Correa, who hits a deep fly ball into center - Robles is on the track and pulls it in for the first, loud out. Maldonado is next. Astros 5-1 Nationals, bottom 8th Eaton pops up in foul ground. Gurriel is under it and makes the catch for out no3. The Astros are three outs away from coming into DC down a pair and leaving up a game after an away sweep! That can\u2019t have happened much over the years. Astros 5-1 Nationals, bottom 8th Turner pokes one into right and Springer nearly misplays it - reaching up to grab the ball at the last moment for the second out. Now it\u2019s up to Eaton in the eighth. Astros 5-1 Nationals, bottom 8th So here is Joe Smith, who the Mets inextricably traded away way back when for reasons I will never truly understand. The man with a submarine...pitching motion gives up a lead-off base hit to Yan Gomes to get the crowd going in the home eighth. Here comes another former Met in Asdrubal Cabrera. He checks his swing on 0-2. Did he go? He did indeed! One down! Turner is next. No sta-min-a... Well, if the soon to be free agent Cole is never going to throw another frame as a member of the Houston Astros, he went out in grand style. 7IP 3H 1R 1ER 2BB 9SO 1HR What else do you want? I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll cook you dinner as well if you ask nicely. Astros 5-1 Nationals, top 8th Marisnick is up now with runners at the corners and two down. On a 2-2 pitch, Hudson misses away, and that\u2019s enough to set off Nats fans again, still simmering over Barksdale\u2019s blown call. Then Marisnick waves at a slider for strike three and the inning is over. A two-out base hit past the glove of the shortstop Turner and the Astros have that run back! That\u2019s a huge knock for the Cuban! Double switch When Hudson came in, he entered in the sixth spot in the order. Zimmerman exited, Kendrick moved over from second to play first, and Cabrera came in to play second base...in case you are scoring at home. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 8th Bregman flies to right and it\u2019s not deep enough for Springer to tag at third base. It\u2019s an important second out for the Nats as Yuli Gurriel comes to the plate, seeking a fourth RBI of this Series. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 8th Daniel Hudson enters in relief for the Nats as their fans continue to protest. Meanwhile Springer doubles off the wall in right field. Then Altuve grounds out to short, sending Springer to third base. With first base open, they\u2019ll intentionally walk Brantely to face Bregman. So it\u2019s first and third for the MVP candidate with one out and some key moments here for Washington. Ridiculous! Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 7th Strike three! But that pitch was high and away! That is a terrible call rom Barksdale. Just terrible. You can\u2019t screw up that call in this spot. Come on MLB! Sort it out! Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 7th Robles is 0-2 tonight but up even in the count at 2-2 after missing a 98MPH fastball. And now the count is full as Robles lets a Cole pitch in the dirt go by... Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 7th Robles swings through high heat to even the count at 1-1. Big at-bat here. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 7th The count is full for Zimmerman - Coles\u2019 104th pitch is up and away, even if Maldonado thought it was strike three and was walking off. It\u2019s a two-out walk. Robles is next, but not before AJ Hinch comes out to have a chin wag with his ace. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 7th Cole comes right back with a strikeout, a 90MPH slider past the bat of the Nats second baseman. Two down now for Zimmerman. Soto wakes up the crowd with a solo blast to center field that barely cleared the wall. Marisnick had a real shot at that ball but it escaped the confines and now the Nats are on the board, which is a first step. Kendrick is next. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 7th Rendon skies a fly ball to left, and for a split second I thought, possibly...maybe...nah. Brantley puts it away. Here\u2019s Soto. Cole cruising at 88 pitches. Defense! For those of you scoring at home... Marisnick is now in center, Brantley is in left, Springer is in right. This just in. I wouldn\u2019t count on Donald Trump ever making the presidents race in DC. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 7th The lefty strikes out Cole, and it\u2019s seventh inning stretch time in DC. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 7th Sean Doolittle is on now to try and keep the lead at four. He\u2019s gogt to face Yordan Alvarez first, and the Cuban greets him with a line drive through the right side of a crowded infield. He\u2019s 3-3 tonight. Jake Marisnick will replace Alvarez as a pinch runner and then stay in to play defense. Now Correa smacks a ground ball to third - tough hop for Rendon but he\u2019s got it. He fires to Kendrick at second base to get Marisnick, then Kendrick throws to Zimmerman at first to get Correa. That\u2019s a double play - two down! Here\u2019s the catcher Maldonado who is 0-2 tonight. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 6th Cole pulls the string with the high slider and Eaton watches it go - strike three, side retired! That\u2019s six more goose eggs now for the Nats, who cannot score! What happened? Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 6th Ground ball to first, Gurriel has to throw his glove hand at a ball that looks like it could\u2019ve gotten by him - but he has it! Now he\u2019s running to the bag and diving, full extension, in time to get Turner! Fantastic play from the Cuban and that\u2019s the second out! Now it\u2019s up to Eaton in the Nats sixth. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 6th Here\u2019s Parra pinch hitting for Rainey. There goes Parra who was pinch hitting for Rainey. He is destroyed on three pitches. Cole in full command. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 6th Gurriel pops to second - inning over. Nats must wake up bats... Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 6th Bregman gives it a ride but Soto is there and puts it away far easier this time around. Two down for Gurriel. Look, he took on a really good lineup, and made two bad pitches. Other than that, you were happy, except when you weren\u2019t happy. He was good but not good. Make sense? Fact is, he could have been Warren Spahn and it wouldn\u2019t matter because the Nats can\u2019t touch Cole. 5IP 5H 4R 4ER 2BB 1SO 2HR Tanner Rainey is in now: he gets Brantley to fly out to left where Soto, taking something of an unusual route, eventually finds the ball and puts it away. Bregman is next. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 5th Cole is cruising. Zimmerman pops to Gurriel in foul territory on the right side, then Robles strikes out. That\u2019s five strikeouts now for the Astros ace. Now Gomes pops to right and that\u2019s a six-pitch fifth inning for Cole, which should have Nats fans swallowing hard. Too easy. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 5th The 0-2 to Altuve: ground ball to second - Kendrick has it, he flips to Turner sho fires to first - double play, side retired! And the esteemed Joel Sherman is being funny! Fair statement from the esteemed Joel Sherman... Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 5th Cole bounces to second for the first out. Now the count is full on George Springer before drawing a walk. They can\u2019t keep Ross in there too much longer can they? Ladies and gentleman... That\u2019s about 90% cheers and two percent boos? Also, there seemed to be a few \u201clock him up\u201d chants... Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 4th Kendrick grounds sharply to short - Correa is on one knee, has it, flips to second to get Rendon on the 6-4 force, and Cole is through four innings, unscathed after 63 pitches. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 4th Soto whiffs on a 98MPH fastball, just the kind of fastball Soto crushed off Cole in Game 1. Now Soto lines out to center field, and there\u2019s two down. Howie Kendrick steps to the plate. It\u2019s quiet. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 4th Eaton looks at strike three on a pitch that may or may not have caught the corner, low and maybe away. Here\u2019s Rendon. Note: Cole is 40-0 with a lead of four or more runs, according to a stat posted by FOX TV in the US. Not a lot of wiggle room according to those numbers, but hey, Rendon just walked. So here is Soto trying to get something, anything going here for the home team. Trouble The Nats have scored two runs in the last 21 innings, in contrast to the 17 they scored in the first two games, away from home. Here comes the heart of their lineup to see if they can get something, anything, going. Eaton is up first in the Nats fourth. Ross hangs one and Correa does not miss! That ball was crushed into left field, and Ross knew it right away as did us all. A huge, damaging swing from Correa proves that he\u2019s still extremely dangerous despite his injury issues. Martin Maldonado lines out to third, into the glove of Rendon and the inning is over, a painful frame for Nats fans. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 4th Ross continues to battle Correa. Now a ball in the dirt bounces away from Gomes - it\u2019s a wild pitch and Alvarez advances down to second base. So a runner in scoring position now with the count even at 2-2... Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 4th Ross is ahead 0-2 and the crowd in DC are on their feet looking to roar! Correa checks his swing on a ball away - did he go? No says Barksdale. So we continue. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 4th Wow, a filthy 3-1 slider and a healthy rip from Alvarez goes without contact. That ball just died at the right time. Now there is a ball and the count is full. Alvarez swings and he\u2019s got a base hit through the shift! It\u2019s a two-out single to right field, exactly where they ain\u2019t, and there\u2019s a baserunner on for Correa. Ross up to 60 pitches... Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 4th Gurriel, a little roller to short - Turner have to hurry...he charges, has it, fires, in time to get him! Two down how for Alvarez, who is responsible for all the runs tonight. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 4th Another foul ball as Ross heads towards the 50 pitch count. How long will Dave Martinez run Ross? He\u2019s past Bregman after the third baseman bounces out to short. That\u2019s one down - Gurriel is next. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 4th So here\u2019s Bregman, who it\u2019s safe to say, after last night, and the way he hit the ball in his first at-bat, is out of that little slump he was in. What can he do with Ross? Well, he\u2019s ahead in the count on the 26-year-old hurler 2-1. Then Ross gets some help from home plate umpire Lance Barksdale (great name, bad call) who calls a pitch outside a strike. Now it\u2019s 3-2 and Bregman laces a ball foul down the right field line. They\u2019ll do it again... Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 3rd Turner hits one on the screws to left, but it\u2019s right at the Cuban rookie and Alvarez puts it away. The Nats are retired in the third. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 3rd Here\u2019s Brazil\u2019s own Yan Gomes, who pops out gently, in foul territory to the first baseman for the first out. Then the pitcher Ross predictably strikes out, leaving it up to Turner. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 3rd Brantley skies to center and Ross has gotten through three innings with that two-run blast against him. I think you\u2019d of signed up for that an hour ago if you were a Nats fan. Right? Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 3rd Cole grounds out to third, so does Springer, and now Jose Altuve is up. The second baseman has himself a broken-bat base hit as the ball falls into shallow right field, providing a two out baserunner for Houston and Michael Brantley. The case of the missing executive and chief is over. Trump is watching the World Series from a luxury suite, which was announced after two full innings by FOX TV in the US. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 2nd Slow roller to short - Correa scoops it up, flips to Altuve who fires to Gurriel over at first - double play! That\u2019s a rally killer off the bat of Robles as the Nats walk off the diamond with nothing despite having had runners at the corners with nobody out. That can\u2019t happen. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 2nd Cole is ahead again - it\u2019s 0-2 to Robles. They\u2019ve got to get at least a run out of this. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 2nd Zimmerman looks bad on a 1-1 fastball, totally fooled by the high pitch. So he\u2019s in the hole here. Wow - he looks even worse on the next pitch, a breaking ball low and away. Some ugly swings from the veteran first baseman. One down for Victor Robles. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 2nd Here is the now 21-year-old Juan Soto at the plate, and he promptly lines a change up into right field, just past the outstretched arm of Gurriel. Now Kendrick is up and he has a knock to right! Soto is heading to third base on that opposite field base hit, and the Nats have something cooking here in the second. Here comes Mr Nationals himself, Ryan Zimmerman, trying to some of those runs back for his club. Where is Trump? FOX TV in the US has not mentioned or shown the President of the United States in attendance at the World Series, which strikes me as odd. Apparently, he has not been shown on the screens at the ballpark either. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 2nd Maldonado taps back to the pitcher - it is easy for Ross who throws to first for the out, and the inning is over. But not before the visitors strike first... Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 2nd Ross bounces back, making Correa miss on a rising fastball for out no2. Now catcher Martin Maldonado heads to the plate with two outs. A replay shows that the fan who got hit with Alvarez\u2019 home run was holding two bottles of beer and did not spill a single drop. That\u2019s poise under pressure... Yordan Alvarez, who was in the midst of a power drought, is no longer - he crushes a ball into the seats in left center field, and that blast silences the crowd at Nationals Park! The Astros are up early, for the third straight game. Here comes Correa to the plate. Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 2nd Bregman hits a screamer to right, but Soto is on it, running to his right and making the grab. One down and here is Gurriel, who hits a high bouncer off the glove of Ross, towards the shortstop Turner - he can\u2019t come up with it! If Ross leaves that alone they have a real shot at Gurriel, but instead, the Cuban stands at first base while Yordan Alvarez heads to the plate. One on, one out. Astros 0-0 Nationals, bottom 1st It\u2019s fastballs, with the occasional knuckle curve and the odd slider so far from Cole. Now Eaton turns on a fastball and sends it deep to center - Springer is stepping back, back, back, but has room and makes the catch. That, as they say, was not missed by much. Two down for Rendon, who promptly skies to center, right back into the trusty glove of Springer, and the side is retied. No runs yet, but Bregman, who had a Grand slam last night, will be first up for Houston when we return. Astros 0-0 Nationals, bottom 1st The count is full to Turner and then the shortstop fouls off a pair of high fastballs to extend the at-bat. Now Turner wastes yet another pitch before he waves at pitch no9. So he\u2019s gone, but he made Cole work while he was there. Eaton is next. Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st Everybody up in Washington! It\u2019s 1-2 to Brantley. Ross sets, and throws high cheese to even the count. On the next pitch Brantley bounces onto the grass in shallow right field. Howie Kendrick, positioned well in the infield shift, waits, has it, and throws to first to get Brantley. Ross has put a zero on the board, which is highly desirable if you\u2019re a Nats fan. Here come DC... Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st Altuve bounces to short - Turner has it, he flips to Kendrick for one out, then the Nats second baseman fires to first, in time to get Altuve. The crowd roars - double play! Two down for Brantley! Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st Springer rips pitch no7 into the left field stands. Ross\u2019 next pitch just misses on the outside corner - that means Springer is walking to first, and the leadoff man is on for Houston. Here comes Houston\u2019s engine, Jose Altuve, who is just 8-20 in the World Series. Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st The count is even at 2-2 before Springer fights off an inside fastball. Then Ross fires a fastball high and the count is full! Here we go! The 26-year-old rears back and delivers a fastball strike to George Springer! Then he gets the slugger to foul off his next offering. It\u2019s 0-2 and the crowd is up in DC. Email Justin Kavanagh (no relation) writes... I\u2018m not sure if Donald Trump knows what he\u2019s walking into tonight: His staff probably told him there was a large Nationals crowd out in the ballpark tonight and he may have misheard. Or the Nats may just have needed a scapegoat to distract the crowd from all the Astros\u2019 winning in DC of late. Your presidential scapegoat is in... Prediction time Momentum is not as good as your next days starting pitcher, for a second straight night. Joe Ross gives the home fans something to cheer about and the Nats win 7-4. Oh, and did I mention that A-Rod likes the Nats? The National Anthem Army Sergeant Major Bob McDonald is familiar sight in DC - he also sang at the Stanley Cup Finals a few seasons ago. He was good tonight - totally strong and honest rendition: quality from start to finish gets him a 8.5/10. A great score! Washington Nationals lineup 1. Trea Turner, SS 2. Adam Eaton, RF 3. Anthony Rendon, 3B 4. Juan Soto, LF 5. Howie Kendrick, 2B 6. Ryan Zimmerman, 1B 7. Victor Robles CF 8. Yan Gomes, C 9. Joe Ross, P Kurt Suzuki\u2019s was injured with a hip-flexor strain in Game 3. Yan Gomes was always expected to catch Patrick Corbin in Game 4, but he must still be banged up because the Brazilian backstop is in the lineup once more. Of course, all eyes will be on 26-year-old Joe Ross, who will take to the hill in DC moments from now... Eight years ago today... People who know me know that I am obsessed with this radio call from Simon Brotherton of the big home run off the bat of David Freese in Game 6 of the 2011 World Series between the Cardinals and Rangers. Brotherton did something that night that I don\u2019t think and American or a Canadian could pull off in soccer - a high level, dramatic broadcast call in an unfamiliar accent. It was special. Max Scherzer Nats skipper Dave Martinez just told FOX TV in the United States that Max Scherzer will start Game 7, if there is a Game 7. First things first, Game 5 is coming up! Please stand by... Some tweets just in... Also... Yes, Cole did get hit in Game 1 to the tune of five earned runs in seven innings pitched, in sharp contrast to the single run he allowed in 22.1 innings he pitched against Tampa Bay and the Yankees. How about Game 5? First pitch is about a quarter-hour away. Stick with us! Houston Astros lineup 1. George Springer, CF 2. Jose Altuve, 2B 3. Michael Brantley, RF 4. Alex Bregman, 3B 5. Yuli Gurriel, 1B 6. Yordan Alvarez, LF 7. Carlos Correa, SS 8. Martin Maldonado, C 9. Gerrit Cole, P Not much to see here other than Robinson Chirinos sitting out the day after a catcher had a home run. Josh Reddick is a strong bat off the bench. The Donald is in Reports say that the President of the United States will be in attendance for Game 5, as probably the best fan in the entire stadium. Could Donald Trump\u2019s winning presence be what Washington needs to get their World Series back on track? Looks like Alex Bregman and I have the same phone - so cool! A few hours ago the phone buzzed and said Max Scherzer wouldn\u2019t be on the hill for Washington in this hyper-critical Game 5. It\u2019s a let down for a neutral baseball fan like myself, but how do Nats fans feel? Surely we can all safely agree that the Nats\u2019 replacement starter, Joe Ross, doesn\u2019t quite carry the cache of their sidelined ace. Yes, it was always going to be a struggle with the Nats\u2019 suddenly stymied offense facing one of Houston\u2019s aces, Gerrit Cole. Now that order is considerably taller. \u201cHe had -- yesterday he had a little bit of spasms in his right trap and neck,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said earlier today. \u201cThey treated it. He woke up today a lot worse......he wants to be out there with his teammates.\u201d Surely the feeling is mutual, especially when you consider that Scherzer sitting out caps off what has been 48 soul-sucking hours that have seen the sizzle siphoned off the once scorching Washington Nationals. This is a team that had arrived home like heroes, having knocked off a heavily favored Astros team in two straight games, inside their own house. They had embarrassed Houston in Game 2 and looked so good that it was challenging to imagine any way back for the AL champs. Houston steadied themselves with a 4-1 victory on Friday, which did little to dampen the enthusiasm around the Nats. That\u2019s because Houston was turning out a virtually unknown bullpen arm named Jose Urquidy to start Game 4. If momentum is the next day\u2019s starting pitcher, then fans in DC had nothing to worry about. Then Urquidy threw five shut out innings and Washington were torched 8-1. Suddenly there was plenty to worry about, and especially so with Scherzer sitting in the dugout. What do the Nats do now? They seek inspiration from Urquidy himself, the hurler who proved that momentum is NOT the next day\u2019s starting pitcher. If Urquidy can do it, so can Ross, must be the thinking. So what if Ross once had an ERA over 9.00 this season. This is the very same Ross who pitched in exactly one game this postseason, and it came in Game 2 where he threw two scoreless innings. So, chin up Washington. Can these Nats muster up what is essentially a must-win in what is their final 2019 game at home? Or will Houston head home with a Tuesday night coronation in mind? All shall be revealed as we get set for Game 5 of the World Series! How will it end? Drop me a twee and let me know @LengelDavid Stand by for live coverage - stick with us! David will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s what happened in Game 4: Alex Bregman broke loose on Saturday night, putting the Houston Astrosahead with an RBI single in the first inning before launching a grand slam in the seventh to lead an 8-1 romp over Washington in Game 4 of the World Series. Holding his bat high, Bregman took a half-dozen steps down the first-base line, watching his game-breaking slam sail over the fences. He added a late single for good measure as the Astros pulled even in the series, 2-2. A day earlier, the regular season MVP candidate was hitless in five-bats, stranding six runners and plunging him to 1 for 13 in the Series. Bregman wasn\u2019t daunted and showed why he\u2019s among the most self-assured players in baseball. Bregman said he felt good swings coming. Asked about his teammate, Michael Brantley echoed that. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about Alex,\u201d Brantley said after a 4-1 win on Friday night. \u201cHe\u2019ll find his breaks. I can\u2019t wait to see him come out tomorrow, I\u2019m ready. You be ready, too.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long: Bregman pounced on the first pitch he saw, and the Astros led the rest of the way. Bregman delivered in a ballpark where he\u2019s had success, and in a city where his family has a legacy. Last year, Bregman\u2019s leadoff home run in the 10th inning at Nationals Park sent the American League to an 8-6 win and earned him the All-Star Game MVP award. A half-century ago, his grandfather was general counsel for the Washington Senators, the team that moved to become the Texas Rangers for the 1971 season, leaving the nation\u2019s capital without the national pastime until the Montreal Expos came in 2005.",

Too many personnel changes, a player leadership group severely weakened and too much invested in a tactical plan based on speed to the neglect of all else, that lacked a fallback option. The warning was there, but largely brushed off, after the calamitous 47-26 loss to Australia in the opening Bledisloe Cup Test of the year.</p> <p>The introduction of the Richie Mo\u2019unga-Beauden Barrett twin-playmaker axis, which got the wobbles during that defeat in Perth, was emblematic of a selection template that came up short. This switch carried plenty of upside, but the combination had too few outings to be fool proof and could not deliver leadership under pressure.</p> <p>Starting the 2014 world player of the year, Brodie Retallick, on such an important night, less than a game of playing time on from a dislocated shoulder, was also a risk. Retallick is a talisman and his presence hardens the All Black pack. England knew that and targeted him physically; stop the lead bull and you stop the herd. But the herd were not so much stopped in this instance as scattered.</p> <p>Like some of the other changes, the positioning of Ardie Savea, a specialist openside, on the blindside flank, was intoxicating when it worked, but that was largely when there was no traffic coming the other way. Damningly, it seduced the All Black hierarchy into not preparing well enough for other eventualities. Scott Barrett was given little time in the No 6 jersey and was ill-prepared for the task he was given against England, especially in a situation where those in front of him were struggling.</p> <p>The New Zealand public has, to a large extent, matured in relation to major All Blacks defeats. With each failure after winning the inaugural tournament in 1987, the pressure had grown on the team, as the demands of the public have become greater. Pressure has led to the mental disintegration of some very good All Black teams, most notably in 1999 and 2007, but the back-to-back successes of 2011 and 2015 loosened that vice, and the public disappointment is now tempered somewhat by the comfort of the previous two wins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/26/well-be-ok-all-blacks-fans-take-world-cup-defeat-on-the-chin\">'It's our religion here': despondent All Blacks fans react to World Cup defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>New Zealanders recognise that England are a good team that was well prepared.

Such was England\u2019s hold on the game, or more specifically on the All Blacks, New Zealand remained helpless, with their discipline and composure disintegrating further as England completed their historic 19-7 victory. Why couldn\u2019t the All Blacks respond? Too many personnel changes, a player leadership group severely weakened and too much invested in a tactical plan based on speed to the neglect of all else, that lacked a fallback option. The warning was there, but largely brushed off, after the calamitous 47-26 loss to Australia in the opening Bledisloe Cup Test of the year. The introduction of the Richie Mo\u2019unga-Beauden Barrett twin-playmaker axis, which got the wobbles during that defeat in Perth, was emblematic of a selection template that came up short. This switch carried plenty of upside, but the combination had too few outings to be fool proof and could not deliver leadership under pressure. Starting the 2014 world player of the year, Brodie Retallick, on such an important night, less than a game of playing time on from a dislocated shoulder, was also a risk. Retallick is a talisman and his presence hardens the All Black pack. England knew that and targeted him physically; stop the lead bull and you stop the herd. But the herd were not so much stopped in this instance as scattered. Like some of the other changes, the positioning of Ardie Savea, a specialist openside, on the blindside flank, was intoxicating when it worked, but that was largely when there was no traffic coming the other way. Damningly, it seduced the All Black hierarchy into not preparing well enough for other eventualities. Scott Barrett was given little time in the No 6 jersey and was ill-prepared for the task he was given against England, especially in a situation where those in front of him were struggling. The New Zealand public has, to a large extent, matured in relation to major All Blacks defeats. With each failure after winning the inaugural tournament in 1987, the pressure had grown on the team, as the demands of the public have become greater. Pressure has led to the mental disintegration of some very good All Black teams, most notably in 1999 and 2007, but the back-to-back successes of 2011 and 2015 loosened that vice, and the public disappointment is now tempered somewhat by the comfort of the previous two wins. New Zealanders recognise that England are a good team that was well prepared. While the ashes are already being raked over, and more detailed forensic examinations will follow, the team and coaching staff will not suffer any of the push back, or personal unpleasantries, that have been the signature of past failures. Hansen has the credit in the bank that his two most vilified predecessors, John Hart and John Mitchell, did not have. What will probably rankle the outgoing All Blacks coach most is the damage to his legacy. When he was re-appointed after the 2015 tournament, Hansen\u2019s major brief was to beat the British &amp; Irish Lions and retain the World Cup. New Zealand Rugby mortgaged the house to make that happen, but the report card will read fail on both KPIs. And, even if Kiwis have learned to be pragmatic this year, that will hurt.",

CI Resources, an ASX-listed mining firm, was recently awarded a $20m contract to provide maintenance for the Christmas Island detention centre, Guardian Australia revealed on Sunday. The detention centre currently houses just four people. The company will provide \u201crepairs, maintenance, cleaning and waste removal\u201d and has about eight cleaners and six gardeners at the centre. Guardian Australia spoke to two recent administrators of Christmas Island \u2013 Stanhope and Brian Lacy \u2013 who said there was some logic in giving the work to CI Resources, given it was one of only two private firms operating on the island, tended to employ locals, and had relevant experience. But Stanhope, a former Labor chief minister of the ACT, said the contract effectively meant taxpayers were spending $20m to sustain a political move by the Morrison government. \u201cThe starting position in relation to this decision is that the centre shouldn\u2019t have been opened in the first place,\u201d Stanhope said. \u201cI\u2019m one of those who believes it was a patently political decision.

Frank Houston, who died in 2004, headed the Assemblies of God church in New Zealand until the early 70s, while Brian was the head of the Australian branch from 1997 until 2009, and founded Hillsong in 1983. Frank was accused of sexually abusing nine boys, and in 2015 the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse found Brian had failed to report his father\u2019s abuse to police. One of Frank\u2019s victims, Brett Sengstock, has since waived his anonymity provided by the commission. He was raped by Frank in the 60s and 70s, and gave evidence to the royal commission under the pseudonym AHA. Sengstock has repeatedly questioned why Brian failed to alert police to his father\u2019s crimes when Frank Houston confessed his guilt in 1999. In an interview on Channel Ten\u2019s The Project on Sunday, Sengstock said it was \u201cshocking\u201d that Morrison, after becoming prime minister, would go on stage with Houston at Hillsong. Morrison addressed the opening session of the church\u2019s annual conference in July. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the audacity. Here\u2019s the prime minister of this country on stage with Brian Houston [who] is currently under investigation by New South Wales police for concealing the crimes of his father, and up there with their arms around each other. I am absolutely lost for words.\u201d Last month the Wall Street Journal reported that Morrison wanted Houston in his entourage for the state dinner with US president Donald Trump in September, but the White House shot down the idea. In an interview with 2GB host Ben Fordham on Thursday, Brian Houston said Sengstock told Houston he did not want the police informed, at the time the church leader found out about his father\u2019s abuse. \u201cHe told me that he didn\u2019t want the police involved,\u201d Houston said. \u201cAnd the reality is that the law itself actually spells out that very circumstance \u2013 that if an adult victim doesn\u2019t want the police involved, that\u2019s a reasonable excuse for not including the police.\u201d Speaking to the New Daily later on Thursday, Sengstock denied he had said that. Houston told Fordham the investigation remained open only because no charges had been laid, and until that happened it would always be open. NSW police have confirmed that the investigation remains open with the Hills area command, but declined to comment further. The royal commission referred Brian Houston to NSW police because he did not report his father\u2019s abuse to police. In Houston\u2019s submission to the commission, he makes it clear he believed at the time that Sengstock did not want to report the matter to police. Houston told the royal commission at the time that because Sengstock was an adult it was \u201chis prerogative\u201d to report it to police, and he did not want it reported. Houston\u2019s lawyers at the time argued if that were not a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d as defined in law, than others, including Sengstock and his mother, were also potentially in breach of the law. Houston confronted his father in November 1999 and said he suspended his father from preaching. He claimed Frank \u201cnever ever preached anywhere again\u201d after that. In December 1999, the national executive of the Assemblies of God decided that Frank Houston\u2019s credentials would be withdrawn. But evidence given to the commission showed Frank Houston was allowed to resign from his position in the church in 2000 and retire with financial support from the church \u201cwithout damage to his reputation or the reputation of Hillsong Church\u201d. Frank\u2019s letter in November 2000 stated he was resigning \u201cas I feel it is time for Hazel and I to enter retirement\u201d. In a December 2001 letter to ministers of the church marked \u201cextremely confidential\u201d, the church\u2019s vice president, Keith Ainge, laid out the reasons for Frank Houston\u2019s departure and the \u201cgreat anguish\u201d it was causing Brian, and warned ministers not to speak publicly about it. \u201cWe cannot see any reason for this to be announced to your church or further afield. Sadly there are always one or two people with their own agendas who will try and get mileage from other people\u2019s pain,\u201d Ainge said. The church admitted it didn\u2019t follow some of the procedures required at the time, and the royal commission found that Houston had a conflict of interest in heading the organisation as it handled the complaints investigation against his father. The Newcastle Herald reported last week it had obtained a recording from 2004, the year Frank died, that showed Frank giving a sermon at a Maitland church. In that sermon, Frank can be heard referring to an eight-year-old boy as \u201cgood looking\u201d. Hillsong has said it will sign up to the federal government\u2019s $4bn national redress scheme established after the royal commission, but has yet to do so. The prime minister refused to say whether Houston\u2019s name was put forward for the White House state dinner.

The figure is expressed as a proportion of men\u2019s earnings.

      "bodyText": "The government has announced \u00a3400m investment to repair school and college buildings in England, but the money will only be available to academies that can demonstrate pay restraint on executive salaries. Academies and sixth form colleges have been invited to bid for a share of the money which can be used to replace roofs, upgrade sports halls or science labs, and deal with general wear and tear in ageing school buildings. But as schools continue to struggle to balance their budgets in the face of funding cuts, ministers are concerned that too many executives in multi-academy trusts are still paying themselves excessive salaries. Now the government has warned that any trusts where a single executive is paid more than \u00a3150,000, or there are two employees taking home in excess of \u00a3100,000 each, will be penalised in the case of an application for building repair money, and an award will be less likely. Since 2017, the government has challenged 278 academy trusts over excessive chief executive pay, but the Department for Education confirmed that fewer than a fifth (51 in total) have reduced top salaries as a result. Teaching unions condemned the money available as woefully inadequate. In 2017, the National Audit Office calculated that it would cost \u00a36.7bn to return England\u2019s schools to a satisfactory condition or better. Two years on the cost is likely to be even higher, said Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union. \u201cThis is simply far too little, far too late and it is unacceptable that, in the 21st century, so many children and young people go to schools which have Victorian conditions.\u201d Bousted said government attempts to link funding to pay restraint only underlined ministers\u2019 failure to address excessive pay in the academy sector.

The annual condition improvement fund (CIF) is open to smaller academy trusts and sixth form colleges to fund building repairs and improvements.

      "bodyText": "Parts of the UK are ageing twice as fast as other areas of the country, while in some cities the population is getting younger, a divergence that will have a lasting impact on local economies, local government and national politics, according to new research. A study by the Resolution Foundation, an independent thinktank, found that the populations of Maldon in Essex, Copeland in Cumbria and Richmondshire in Yorkshire are ageing twice as fast as the rest of the UK, while Nottingham and Oxford are growing younger. The report, entitled Ageing, fast and slow: When place and demography collide, said that while the UK population as a whole is ageing \u2013 one in four will be older than 65 by 2041 \u2013 there are widespread divergences in the pace and even the direction of ageing. The UK\u2019s average age has been rising steadily, from 36 in 1975 to 40 today, but there is a 25-year gap between the oldest and youngest local authorities: North Norfolk, where the average age is 54, and Oxford, where it is 29, reflecting its large universities, the Resolution Foundation said. It found 60 local areas across the UK have a higher average age of older than 50, higher than Japan, the country with the highest average age of 46. In contrast, Nottingham and Oxford are among 23 places in the UK that have a younger average age than Chile\u2019s 34. By region, London has the youngest typical age, at 35 years.

The thinktank says increasing divergence between old and young areas will have a lasting impact on local economies, local governments and national politics.
