      "bodyText": "Evergreen Adam Ashley-Cooper and fledgling Jordan Petaia have bolted into the most experienced Australian squad ever named to contest a Rugby World Cup. Two midfield backs at polar ends of their careers have been included in Michael Cheika\u2019s 31-man squad unveiled in Sydney on Friday. Boasting 45 caps per player, Cheika\u2019s Test-hardened group features a record three centurions in Ashley-Cooper, halfback Will Genia and prop Sekope Kepu along with two others poised to raise three figures in Japan - captain Michael Hooper and lock Rob Simmons. Ashley-Cooper, 35, becomes the oldest Wallaby selected for a World Cup and Petaia, at 19, the youngest. Ashley-Cooper has played the third-most Wallabies Tests (118) and scored the third-most tries (37). He joins Will Genia as the only Australians to attend four editions of the global tournament. It rewards the Waratahs veteran for his bold call to spurn the riches of Japanese club rugby this year to pursue another crack at the Webb Ellis Cup. At the other end of the spectrum is uncapped Queensland Reds back Petaia, a selection based on raw attacking potential. Petaia suffered a serious foot injury in early March and has won selection on the back of recent club action on return to fitness. Twelve of the squad were involved in the 2015 campaign, when Cheika defied the odds by overseeing a trip to the Twickenham final, won by the All Blacks. Seven of those players were also at the 2011 tournament. A born-again James O\u2019Connor attended 2011 but missed 2015. O\u2019Connor is among a raft of midfield backs named by Cheika. Nine of his squad have started a Test at inside or outside centre, and Petaia is poised to become the 10th. It has left him thin on numbers in other positions. Cheika has gambled on just two specialist halfbacks, while only five loose forwards have been named, including veteran David Pocock who hasn\u2019t played since March because of injury. Cheika said his balance was carefully planned. \u201cIt\u2019s also important that we select a squad that will handle the tournament play and our draw in particular at the Rugby World Cup, as well as maintain a strong competition for places in the team,\u201d he said. Among the unluckiest omissions are fullback Tom Banks, halfback Joe Powell, hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau and flankers Liam Wright and Luke Jones, who will join the World Cup squad as train-on players at a 10-day preparation camp in New Caledonia. They return to play Samoa in Sydney on September 7, two weeks out from an opening group game against Fiji in Sapporo. The other pool opponents are Wales, Uruguay and Georgia. \u201cThese next few weeks are about building and adding that little extra edge as a squad and we\u2019ll be working hard to make sure we deliver on the qualities we want people to see when we run out on the field in Japan,\u201d Cheika said.

A \u201croot and branch\u201d review launched by the Department of Health and Social Care on Friday will examine whether the number of hospitals catering in-house can be increased. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, called for the comprehensive review in June, when six people died after contracting listeria from pre-packaged sandwiches and salads either bought on site or given out by hospital staff. The review will also consider whether kitchen facilities can be changed to bring more chefs into hospitals, as well as using less frozen food and sourcing local fresh produce where possible.

And it should help, not hinder, the patient\u2019s recovery.\u201d The review will examine the quality of the estimated 140m meals provided to patients each year, as well as staff meals. The review was announced as a former health chief blamed \u201csystematic failures\u201d in public health for 17 deaths linked to separate outbreaks of listeria and streptococcus earlier this year. In July, NHS Mid Essex Clinical Commissioning Group confirmed 13 people had died in an outbreak of invasive group A streptococcus. Writing in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine on Friday, Prof John Ashton, the former north-west regional director of public health, warned that years of austerity and cuts to local authority budgets had stripped the ability of environmental health departments to keep up with threats. The review has been welcomed by Boris Johnson, who said: \u201cSince entering Downing Street, my focus has been clear: to make sure our world-class NHS has everything it needs to continue providing the very best frontline care. \u201cGuaranteeing hospitals serve nutritional, tasty and fresh meals will not only aid patient recovery, but also fuel staff and visitors as they care for loved ones and the vulnerable.\u201d The review will be chaired by the former head of the Hospital Caterers Association and catering lead for Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, Philip Shelley.

      "body": "<h2>1) Liverpool welcome Arsenal as Emery faces first real test</h2> <p>This is where it gets serious for Arsenal. They have made a solid start, seeing off Newcastle and Burnley by one-goal margins, and there is renewed optimism after an encouraging show of ambition in the summer. As transfer windows go from an Arsenal perspective, the signings of David Luiz, Kieran Tierney, Dani Ceballos and Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 represent a big step in the right direction and have gone a way towards quelling supporter unrest. Yet Unai Emery\u2019s side have not faced a proper test yet and they will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/21/liverpool-arsenal-anfield-premier-league-start\">learn how much progress has been made</a> when they visit Anfield. Arsenal have suffered 3-1, 4-0 and 5-1 defeats on their last three visits, so cannot come out all guns blazing against the European champions. We know they can score against anyone but this is an opportunity for the north Londoners to show that David Luiz will improve their defence and prove they are capable of maintaining their organisation when the going gets tough. <strong>JS<br>Liverpool v Arsenal, Saturday, 5.30pm (all times BST)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2) Bournemouth ponder how to stop Manchester City</h2> <p>Riyad Mahrez scored the only goal on Manchester City\u2019s last visit to Dorset in March. It was a scruffy strike and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/02/bournemouth-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">a dreadful game</a>, but it was the fact Bournemouth had no shots, no corners and less than 20% possession that dominated the discourse. England defender Kyle Walker, for example, completed more passes than the entire Bournemouth team but Pep Guardiola described it as one of his side\u2019s best performances, while Eddie Howe said City were so peerless that they did not give his side a sniff. Howe took plenty of flak for successfully making life difficult \u2013 until that game City led 24-3 across seven top-flight meetings \u2013 and he must be tempted to do so again, and bear the brunt of any criticism that will inevitably come. \u201cIt is difficult,\u201d Howe said. \u201cYou want to be competitive but that was the way for us to make the game tight.\u201d <strong>BF<br>Bournemouth v Manchester City, Sunday, 2pm</strong></p> <h2>3) Bruce already under pressure</h2> <p>Newcastle visit Tottenham looking for their first point, with Steve Bruce already facing questions about the tactics \u2013 or lack of them \u2013 he employs. His team were dismal at Norwich last week and, in the aftermath, former Newcastle striker Michael Chopra claimed in a radio interview with TalkSport that he had spoken to senior players at the club who claimed they \u201cdon\u2019t know their jobs\u201d under Bruce. On social media, Chopra\u2019s comments seemed to be largely ridiculed by fans who preferred to focus on his own shortcomings as a player rather than address the clearly salient points he made about those currently representing their team. While all available evidence from the Norwich debacle suggests he might have had a point, Sunday\u2019s trip ought to provide Newcastle supporters with a very clear indication of exactly just how concerned they should be. <strong>BG</strong><br><strong>Tottenham v Newcastle, Sunday, 4.30pm</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f73adf9c4558020dda15ecf13d8b21449a0cd12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f73adf9c4558020dda15ecf13d8b21449a0cd12/0_0_4910_2410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newcastle players play a possession game during training this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"491\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newcastle players play a possession game during training this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Old friends Wan-Bissaka and Zaha set for tasty duel</h2> <p>The first time Aaron Wan-Bissaka came up against Wilfried Zaha, the rookie right-back surprised Crystal Palace\u2019s best player by nullifying him with his turn of pace and tackling ability. Both players will remember those duels when Palace visit Old Trafford. Unfortunately for Palace they are not teammates any more and Wan-Bissaka, who has not looked out of place after his \u00a345m move to Manchester United, could be tasked with subduing Zaha when he faces his old side. Unlike Wan-Bissaka, Zaha did not get his summer move and Roy Hodgson, whose side are yet to score this season, needs the winger to step up. <strong>JS<br>Manchester United v Crystal Palace, Saturday, 3pm</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/aug/22/penalty-palaver-neymar-and-strife-at-bolton-and-bury-football-weekly-extra\">Penalty palaver, Neymar and strife at Bolton and Bury \u2013 Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>5) Lampard needs a solution</h2> <p>While those of us who thought Teemu Pukki might struggle to carry Championship form into the Premier League are left wiping a combination of egg and remnants of humble pie from our faces, Chelsea travel to Carrow Road, hoping to put a stop to the gallop of a striker who scored 29 goals last season and has already got four to his name in his first two top-flight excursions. Yet to keep a clean sheet in three competitive games without a win under Frank Lampard, they have been handed a boost with the news Antonio Rudiger has been declared fit and could replace Kurt Zouma in the heart of their defence. It is further up the pitch where Chelsea\u2019s defensive shortcomings seem more apparent, as was evidenced by the manner in which both Manchester United and Leicester repeatedly bypassed their midfield.

      "bodyText": "1) Liverpool welcome Arsenal as Emery faces first real test This is where it gets serious for Arsenal. They have made a solid start, seeing off Newcastle and Burnley by one-goal margins, and there is renewed optimism after an encouraging show of ambition in the summer. As transfer windows go from an Arsenal perspective, the signings of David Luiz, Kieran Tierney, Dani Ceballos and Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 represent a big step in the right direction and have gone a way towards quelling supporter unrest. Yet Unai Emery\u2019s side have not faced a proper test yet and they will learn how much progress has been made when they visit Anfield. Arsenal have suffered 3-1, 4-0 and 5-1 defeats on their last three visits, so cannot come out all guns blazing against the European champions. We know they can score against anyone but this is an opportunity for the north Londoners to show that David Luiz will improve their defence and prove they are capable of maintaining their organisation when the going gets tough. JS Liverpool v Arsenal, Saturday, 5.30pm (all times BST) 2) Bournemouth ponder how to stop Manchester City Riyad Mahrez scored the only goal on Manchester City\u2019s last visit to Dorset in March. It was a scruffy strike and a dreadful game, but it was the fact Bournemouth had no shots, no corners and less than 20% possession that dominated the discourse. England defender Kyle Walker, for example, completed more passes than the entire Bournemouth team but Pep Guardiola described it as one of his side\u2019s best performances, while Eddie Howe said City were so peerless that they did not give his side a sniff. Howe took plenty of flak for successfully making life difficult \u2013 until that game City led 24-3 across seven top-flight meetings \u2013 and he must be tempted to do so again, and bear the brunt of any criticism that will inevitably come. \u201cIt is difficult,\u201d Howe said. \u201cYou want to be competitive but that was the way for us to make the game tight.\u201d BF Bournemouth v Manchester City, Sunday, 2pm 3) Bruce already under pressure Newcastle visit Tottenham looking for their first point, with Steve Bruce already facing questions about the tactics \u2013 or lack of them \u2013 he employs. His team were dismal at Norwich last week and, in the aftermath, former Newcastle striker Michael Chopra claimed in a radio interview with TalkSport that he had spoken to senior players at the club who claimed they \u201cdon\u2019t know their jobs\u201d under Bruce. On social media, Chopra\u2019s comments seemed to be largely ridiculed by fans who preferred to focus on his own shortcomings as a player rather than address the clearly salient points he made about those currently representing their team. While all available evidence from the Norwich debacle suggests he might have had a point, Sunday\u2019s trip ought to provide Newcastle supporters with a very clear indication of exactly just how concerned they should be. BG Tottenham v Newcastle, Sunday, 4.30pm 4) Old friends Wan-Bissaka and Zaha set for tasty duel The first time Aaron Wan-Bissaka came up against Wilfried Zaha, the rookie right-back surprised Crystal Palace\u2019s best player by nullifying him with his turn of pace and tackling ability. Both players will remember those duels when Palace visit Old Trafford. Unfortunately for Palace they are not teammates any more and Wan-Bissaka, who has not looked out of place after his \u00a345m move to Manchester United, could be tasked with subduing Zaha when he faces his old side. Unlike Wan-Bissaka, Zaha did not get his summer move and Roy Hodgson, whose side are yet to score this season, needs the winger to step up. JS Manchester United v Crystal Palace, Saturday, 3pm 5) Lampard needs a solution While those of us who thought Teemu Pukki might struggle to carry Championship form into the Premier League are left wiping a combination of egg and remnants of humble pie from our faces, Chelsea travel to Carrow Road, hoping to put a stop to the gallop of a striker who scored 29 goals last season and has already got four to his name in his first two top-flight excursions. Yet to keep a clean sheet in three competitive games without a win under Frank Lampard, they have been handed a boost with the news Antonio Rudiger has been declared fit and could replace Kurt Zouma in the heart of their defence. It is further up the pitch where Chelsea\u2019s defensive shortcomings seem more apparent, as was evidenced by the manner in which both Manchester United and Leicester repeatedly bypassed their midfield. A team that has refused to compromise their principles as they embark on this season\u2019s adventure, Norwich are similarly lethal in transitional play and should cause their opponents similar problems. Lampard will need to come up with a solution if he is to secure his first win. BG Norwich v Chelsea, Saturday, 12.30pm 6) Villa feel optimism but look short in attack The last time Aston Villa entertained Everton, home supporters staged a walkout in protest against then owner Randy Lerner. Discontent reigned, apathetic fans\u2019 feelings summed up by a banner in the stands at Old Trafford when relegation was confirmed a month later. It read: from Rotterdam to Rotherham. Fast-forward three years and, despite a pointless start on their Premier League return, the mood could not be more different under Dean Smith. The early performances have been encouraging \u2013 Villa Park is sold out on Friday \u2013 but there is already a worrying onus on Wesley, a \u00a322m club-record signing from Club Brugge and the only senior striker in the squad, to find the net. Scott Hogan has been farmed out on loan to Stoke, Jonathan Kodjia is injured and 21-year-old Keinan Davis has not scored a league goal since September 2017. Villa spent more than \u00a3127m this summer, making 12 signings but Smith\u2019s side already seem stretched.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of photographs, prints and letters that reveal the private passions and public interests of Queen Victoria\u2019s husband Prince Albert have been published online to mark the 200th anniversary of his birth. The Royal Collection has digitised 17,500 documents for a new website, the majority publicly available for the first time. Curators hope the project will offer a fresh perspective on Albert\u2019s contribution \u201cas Queen Victoria\u2019s unofficial private secretary\u201d as well as his importance for some of the greatest national projects of his day. By 2020, the hope is that 23,500 items will be available. They include Albert\u2019s collection of 10,000 photographs that covered just about every genre and theme. The website includes personal photographs of the royal family which show the couple\u2019s children as they grew up, as well as images which documented the world around him, for example a rare daguerrotype of the Chartist demonstration on Kennington Common in 1848. Helen Trompeteler, senior curator of photographs at Royal Collection, said Albert was an important figure in the early history of photographs. \u201cHe sincerely believed in photography as an art form at a time when its role in society was being debated,\u201d she said. \u201cHe really saw photography\u2019s potential across every aspect of society, from art to historical record to being a tool for arts scholarship.\u201d There are stacks of fascinating personal correspondence between Albert and Victoria on the website. For example when she became Queen in 1837, he sent a letter of congratulations from Germany which probably didn\u2019t ease any worries she might have had about ascending to the throne. \u201cMy dearest Cousin, I must write you a few lines to present you with my sincerest felicitations to that great change, which took place with your life. Now you are Queen of the mightiest land of Europe, in your hand lies the happiness of millions.\u201d A later note, written in German on the day of their engagement, bursts with passion: \u201cHow is it that I have deserved so much love, so much affection? I cannot get used to the reality of all that I see and hear, and have to believe that heaven has sent me an angel whose brightness shall illume my life.\u201d There are also letters and journal entries by Victoria available to read, including pages about how Albert would play with their children by wrapping a napkin around their waist and swinging them back and forth under his legs. She includes a little drawing for added effect. The website is one of a number of events and projects marking the 200th anniversary of both Victoria and Albert\u2019s birth. On bank holiday Monday, the date of Albert\u2019s birth, anyone sharing his name \u2013 Franz August Karl Albert Emanuel \u2013 can have free access to the couple\u2019s Isle of Wight retreat, Osborne. Any of the names, English Heritage stressed, not necessarily all of them.",

      "bodyText": "The England goalkeeper, Carly Telford, has criticised the efforts of France as Women\u2019s World Cup hosts, describing the tournament as \u201ca balloon that deflated quickly\u201d and has called for the Football Association to learn from the mistakes by making the 2021 home European Championship the \u201cbest competition in women\u2019s football history\u201d. \u201cI felt the crowds were good, especially the England fans \u2013 when we were up north they were amazing \u2013 but the feedback from friends and families and people that were involved was that it wasn\u2019t well hosted,\u201d the Chelsea goalkeeper said. \u201cA lot of the towns and cities weren\u2019t as kitted out or as football-friendly as they needed to be and I think we can learn from that. \u201cIf we can host in the right cities at the right times and give people a real buzz, then I think we can host not only the best Euros in history but one of the best competitions in women\u2019s football history.\u201d From the ticketing scandal, which led to families being seated separately for some games (news of which broke before a ball had been kicked), to many key host cities showing little evidence of a World Cup taking place, Fifa and the local organising committee in France found themselves the focus of much unwanted attention. Telford said what England\u2019s players saw on television, including less than full stadiums, and what they came across when visiting family and friends left them underwhelmed. \u201cAnd then what our friends and family were saying,\u201d the 32\u2011year\u2011old said. \u201cWalking around the cities there was no real guidance to where the stadiums were, where the fan zones were, and there wasn\u2019t much in the fan zones. \u201cConsidering how well the Netherlands had hosted the Euros and Canada the World Cup it was a little bit disappointing, because you\u2019d class France as one of biggest hosts in Europe. \u201cIt was a balloon that went up and deflated quite quickly. I\u2019m not sure we left a mark in France in terms of having a World Cup there or not. We fed it back to our guys and we said: \u2018Let\u2019s not do this in 2021.\u2019\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here is a roundup ... So, that\u2019ll do! I think we\u2019d all agree that was pretty entertaining \u2013 and hats off to Linfield &amp; Wolves in particular for two exceptional results. Celtic did superbly too and Rangers look well set going into their home leg. Plenty to chew on before we come back for the return ties. Bye for now! Torino 2-3 Wolves Celtic 2-0 AIK Linfield 3-2 Qarabag Legia Warsaw 0-0 Rangers AEK 1-3 Trabzonspor FSCB 0-0 Vitoria Gent 2-1 Rijeka PSV Eindhoven 3-0 Apollon Limassol Strasbourg 1-0 Eintracht Frankfurt AZ Alkmaar 1-1 Antwerp Braga 1-0 Spartak Moscow Espanyol 3-1 Zorya Luhansk Partizan Belgrade 2-1 Molde Slovan Bratislava 1-0 PAOK FK Suduva 0-0 Ferencvaros Malmo 3-0 Bnei Yehuda Feyenoord 3-0 Hapoel Beer-Sheva Ludogorets 0-0 Maribor Copenhagen 3-1 Riga Astana 3-0 BATE Borisov Ararat Armenia 2-1 F91 Dudelange That\u2019s a brilliant result from Wolves despite the fact that, like Qarabag, Torino put away a late spot kick. They have three goals and it\u2019d be a surprise if they didn\u2019t see this through now. Traore was electric, Jimenez superb, and this victory was throughly merited. And Torino almost complete the comeback, Rui Patricio turning a vicious Belotti effort around the post! Belotti drills it low and gives Torino a lifeline. A careless foul from Vinaigre, and maybe this ain\u2019t over! \u201cDo any other neutrals have an enduring soft spot for Wolves purely on the basis of their unusual but appealing name, classic colours and fantastic badge!?\u201d asks Chris Bojke. There is something old-world about them, I agree, and it\u2019s charming to try and hang onto it even though the club is a very different animal, so to speak, these days. Will we see a Serbian team in the group stage? The chances of that have increased now Zoran Tosic, the Manchester United old boy, has given Partizan a late 2-1 lead over Molde. Wolves look so good, so composed, so balanced between defence and attack. They could go a long way in this competition. Espanyol now lead Zorya 3-1 so we can probably say they\u2019ve fought that fire. A fine first-leg result there for Celtic, and well deserved too. That Edouard free-kick was especially memorable. What a goal this is! Jimenez runs through, brilliantly beats his man, slots home and puts Wolves in a quite possibly unassailable position! It\u2019s the final action but the whistle is still greeted by roars at Windsor Park. And so it should be \u2013 that late penalty was a shame but they have the advantage and another performance of this resilience and quality in Baku will give them a decent chance next week. A night to remember for Linfield and Northern Irish club football. He Panenkas it! Such coolness with the tie possibly on the line. Linfield are still on for a famous win but you\u2019d probably give Qarabag the upper hand now. Ah. We\u2019re a minute and a half from the end of added time and a late, tired challenge gives Qarabag a chance to change the complexion somewhat ... Jimenez twists, turns and has a shot blocked as Wolves seek a third goal in Turin. Now Linner makes a double save from Edouard and Morgan. Celtic have been very good indeed since the break. What an entertaining evening this has become. McGregor is within an inch of giving Celtic a surely unassailable 3-0 lead there, with nine to play. Linfield are a little over five minutes from a remarkable result. Espanyol have plundered an equaliser against Zorya. FCSB have drawn 0-0 against Vitoria. Strasbourg held on to beat Eintracht 1-1 and AZ drew 1-1 with Antwerp. PSV beat Apollon 3-0 and Gent overcame Rijeka 2-1. Ah, well it\u2019s not done yet. Wolves immediately fall asleep on a cross from the left and De Silvestri steals over to head in. It\u2019s a good game! Yep, there\u2019s the second! No surprise that it comes from another ripping run from Traore, who has been pretty much unplayable. He reaches the byline and pulls back for Jota, who finishes clinically! Oh, what a strike! Edouard weighs up a free-kick 25 yards out, steps forward and bends a sublime effort around the wall and past Linner. Celtic have a foot in the groups too! This is incredible! A Qarabag defender dithers on halfway and Lavery, hassling him tirelessly, robs him before running half the length of the pitch, cutting inside a covering man and then curling home a sublime finish! It\u2019s on the break, it\u2019s completely unexpected, and now they can hold genuine hope of the group stage! Ricardo Horta has given Braga a 1-0 advantage over Spartak Moscow with 16 minutes to play. PSV lead Apollon 3-0. It is attack against defence, to all intents and purposes, in Belfast now but Linfield are edging towards that place in the driving seat ahead of the return. Including added time there are about 20 to play. Torino\u2019s Ansaldi is booked for an agricultural foul on the flying Traore, who has caused a world of trouble so far. Oh, and they are back underway in Turin. Wolves could easily sneak another goal this half, I reckon. Gent are 2-1 up against Rijeka now and it\u2019s your friend &amp; mine, the ex-Huddersfield battleaxe Laurent Depoitre, with both of them! Linfield have reached the hour mark ahead, still 2-1. Can they hang on for a really famous result? Or even build on this lead? Copenhagen ended up beating Riga 3-1; Trabzonspor did exactly that to AEK Athens, away from home. Feyenoord came out 3-0 winners against Hapoel Beer-Sheva and Malmo also beat Bnei Yehuda 3-0 on a bad night for Israel. It was goalless between Ludogorets and Maribor. Linner partly atones with a fingertip stop to his right \u2013 sorry, didn\u2019t see who the attacker was. But Celtic have made a flying start to this half! But they lead now! Forrest bursts into the area and the AIK keeper Linner, who has saved a few so far, seems to have thwarted him again. But he can\u2019t get enough of a strong hand on it \u2013 the ball loops up and drops slowly into the net, and Celtic Park goes mad! Celtic are back underway against AIK and McGregor has just forced a decent save with a stinging 25-yard drive. Nothing comes of the corner. It\u2019s half-time in Turin! Wolves will be very happy: they lead 1-0 through that Izzo own goal just a few minutes ago. Both sides will be glad enough of that. I\u2019m just glad it was only one of four games on my screen because it looked fairly ... uneventful. That\u2019s the one they wanted! And I think they deserve it too. Moutinho sizes up a free-kick from the left, Saiss is among those to jump for it, and it\u2019s flicked into the net off a Torino head! It looks like it\u2019s come off Izzo, in fact, and nestles in the corner! Two quick goals in Belgrade, where Partizan and Molde were goalless but are now 1-1 \u2013 the home side equalising on the stroke of half-time. Another good Wolves counter sees Jimenez fail to find the supporting Traore with a final ball. At the other end Belotti cuts inside before flashing a shot not far wide. It\u2019s decent enough fare there. Zorya Luhansk lead 1-0 at Espanyol through Vladyslav Kochergin, which would count as a surprise if it remained that way. It\u2019s half-time at Celtic Park \u2013 goalless. Ekuban has his hat-trick for Trabzonspor at AEK Athens! It\u2019s 3-1 there and Sturridge might have his work cut out to get in at this point. I just saw Allan McGregor make a pretty smart save for Rangers, although what I didn\u2019t see was who from. Ten minutes to go in Warsaw and they\u2019ll be happy if it stays goalless. I don\u2019t want to say not a lot is happening at Celtic v AIK but the club have just announced this: The turnaround is complete! A left-sided set-piece comes across again, but this time it\u2019s a corner. Shane Lavery beats a frankly nowhere goalkeeper to the ball and heads into the vacant net. Linfield, who could have been well out of this, now lead the tie! Close for Wolves again! It\u2019s right-sided free-kick whipped in for Dendoncker who, once he\u2019s risen and met it, really should do better than head wide! Twenty-four minutes gone there. Well! I think that\u2019s their first effort on target. A free-kick is delivered from the left and Mark Stafford, timing his run perfectly, nods in on the run! The tie is alive, out of nothing! Linfield are still a goal down, with seven minutes til the break, and being completely dominated. Two sides that *have* notched away goals are Antwerp, who lead 1-0 at AZ, and Rijeka, who are winning 1-0 at Gent. Half-time in both. You\u2019d enjoy a visit to Rijeka if you supported Arsenal or Man United. Traore is causing all kinds of chaos down the right-hand side \u2013 he\u2019s just forced more desperate defending from a blistering run and cross. On early evidence you\u2019d fancy Wolves to get an away goal tonight. Good chance for Wolves! Sirigu saves really well with his legs from Jota after a lightning run from Adama Traore, who is playing at wing-back today. Rangers are still goalless at Legia as we hit the hour there. It\u2019s not exactly a thrill a minute as far as I can see. Wolves are counterattacking with decent purpose against Torino, who themselves have shown some lively moments. Celtic continue to probe against AIK \u2013 Odsonne Edouard has just surged towards the box and seen a good effort parried wide. Kevin Lucien Zohi has put Strasbourg a goal up against last season\u2019s semi-finalists Eintracht Frankfurt \u2013 who of course are now without Luka Jovic and Seb Haller. Copenhagen might have spared their blushes against Riga for this week at least \u2013 they lead 2-1. Now Qarabag miss an absolute sitter at Linfield \u2013 whacking the post from close in when it seemed easier to score. They could wrap this entire two-legged tie up before long if Linfield aren\u2019t careful. Celtic, meanwhile, look lively against AIK and have had a goal chalked off for offside, but it\u2019s goalless still. It sounds lively in Turin \u2013 where Wolves will soon kick off ... A ball flipped over the top, an outstretched boot from the onrushing Qarabag man, and the ball loops up into Linfield\u2019s goal. It could be a long way back from here against experienced European opponents. \u201cDid you know that Larsson in the AIK team is the Seb Larsson that played in Arsenal, Birmingham and Sunderland?\u201d writes Hakan Burden. I do now! One of the better free-kick takers of the past decade even if the rest of his game wasn\u2019t quite top-level. Linfield and Celtic are both underway. Wolves will be soon. Malmo have beaten Bnei Yehuda 3-0. Lithuanian hopes are meanwhile alive as Suduva have held Ferencvaros to a goalless draw at home. Trabzonspor now lead 2-1 at AEK! Maybe we\u2019ll see Sturridge in Europe after all. Caleb Ekuban, once of Leeds you know, has nabbed them both. Rangers don\u2019t appear to be creating all that much at Legia as we near half-time \u2013 though the crowd is, as mentioned, definitely making it into an occasion. Nip and tuck for Stevie G\u2019s crew at the moment; suspect this will be a tight tie right to the bitter end. A surprise on the cards in Copenhagen? Vladimirs Kamess has made it 1-1 there with a big away goal for minnows Riga ... Trabzonspor \u2013 minus their new signing Daniel Sturridge for now \u2013 have also plundered an away goal in Athens. It\u2019s 1-1 with AEK. Celtic: Gordon, Ajer, Jullien, Simunovic, Bolingoli Mbombo, Forrest, Brown, McGregor, Christie, Edouard, Johnston. Subs: Hazard, Bitton, Griffiths, Bayo, Hayes, Morgan, Ntcham. AIK: Linner, Granli, Karlsson, Mets, Lundstrom, Larsson, Adu, Bahoui, Lindkvist, Goitom, Sigthorsson.

Can\u2019t imagine either fanbase keeping too quiet \u2013 sounds electric in there. Torino: Sirigu, Izzo, N\u2019Koulou, Bremer, De Silvestri, Meite, Baselli, Ansaldi, Zaza, Belotti, Berenguer.

Feyenoord, Copenhagen and AEK have all taken the lead since that first bulletin. Malmo are 3-0 up! And welcome! It\u2019s time for the sharp end of the ... erm ... blunt end.

      "body": "<p>Eddie Jones had been in his job a matter of months when he called a meeting at the Rugby Football Union and announced \u201cI can\u2019t see any natural sevens in England\u201d. He then asked all the age-grade coaches present to find him one.</p> <p>It may go down as one of the more important meetings in his tenure, because a few weeks from the World Cup and for England\u2019s penultimate warm-up game he pairs Tom Curry and Sam Underhill together for the first time. Back then he turned to \u201csix-and-a-halves\u201d but on Thursday Jones ushered in the era of the \u201cKamikaze Kids\u201d.</p> <p>Asked to elaborate on why Curry and Underhill have earned that nickname, Jones was typically pithy \u2013 \u201cthey hit everything that moves\u201d \u2013 but equally he was referring to their long injury histories considering they are 21 and 23 respectively.</p> <p>Jones named them to face Wales two weeks ago only for Underhill to pull up with a toe injury. Curry started and was outstanding for half an hour before picking up a shoulder injury.

He then asked all the age-grade coaches present to find him one. It may go down as one of the more important meetings in his tenure, because a few weeks from the World Cup and for England\u2019s penultimate warm-up game he pairs Tom Curry and Sam Underhill together for the first time. Back then he turned to \u201csix-and-a-halves\u201d but on Thursday Jones ushered in the era of the \u201cKamikaze Kids\u201d. Asked to elaborate on why Curry and Underhill have earned that nickname, Jones was typically pithy \u2013 \u201cthey hit everything that moves\u201d \u2013 but equally he was referring to their long injury histories considering they are 21 and 23 respectively. Jones named them to face Wales two weeks ago only for Underhill to pull up with a toe injury. Curry started and was outstanding for half an hour before picking up a shoulder injury.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Stephen Smiley bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 23 August.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Indigenous deaths in custody have worsened in the 12 months since Guardian Australia released its Deaths Inside project</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/23/indigenous-deaths-in-custody-worsen-over-year-of-tracking-by-deaths-inside-project\">with 17 more deaths recorded since August last year</a>. Analysis shows that<strong> </strong>government failures to follow its own procedures and provide appropriate medical care to Indigenous people in custody are major causes of the rising rates of Indigenous people dying in jail. In August 2018 an exclusive analysis of 10 years of coronial data found 407 Indigenous people had died in police or prison custody since the end of the royal commission in 1991; as of today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/28/deaths-inside-indigenous-australian-deaths-in-custody\">that figure has increased to 424</a>. In that time, the federal government has failed to respond to two major reviews, and<strong> </strong>only three jurisdictions \u2013 Western Australia, Victoria and the Northern Territory \u2013 have implemented a custody notification service to match the life-saving program operating in NSW.</p> <p><strong>Logging is causing Melbourne\u2019s main catchment </strong><strong> to miss out on 15,000 megalitres of water each year</strong>, equivalent to the amount used by 250,000 people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/23/melbourne-loses-15000-megalitres-of-water-annually-from-logging-study-finds\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/23/melbourne-loses-15000-megalitres-of-water-annually-from-logging-study-finds\">study has found</a>. Researchers from the Australian National University said logging in the catchment made little economic sense, given the water lost was worth far more than the timber, most of which is used to make paper. The Thomson catchment, to the city\u2019s north-east, is Melbourne\u2019s most important, feeding a reservoir that provides nearly 60% of the city\u2019s water storage capacity.</p> <p><strong>Australian cheesemakers are mobilising against a proposed European crackdown on the naming of hundreds of products</strong> \u2013 including feta, mozzarella and gorgonzola \u2013 warning not only of job losses but of a degradation of Australia\u2019s rich multicultural history. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/23/australian-cheesemakers-warn-eu-name-crackdown-will-cost-jobs\">As part of negotiations between Australia and the EU</a> over a new free trade agreement, the EU has put forward a list of geographic indicators that it believes Australian producers should not be able to use. The ruling would capture many Australian producers with European ancestry who have continued the food tradition and methods of their forebears. Under the proposed changes, the EU would ban Australia using the names of 236 beverages and 172 foods, including 56 cheeses.</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e51d8ffec5ce9460063ca53119127e8f3ead99f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e51d8ffec5ce9460063ca53119127e8f3ead99f/0_0_2756_1903/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young Rohingya is seen during a rainstorm at the Nayapara refugee camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young Rohingya is seen during a rainstorm at the Nayapara refugee camp in Bangladesh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Joyce/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>An attempt to repatriate 3,000 Rohingya Muslims who fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh has failed.</strong> The Myanmar government had approved the attempt but, as also happened in November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/22/rohingya-refugees-turn-down-second-myanmar-repatriation-effort\">none of the refugees agreed to voluntarily board the buses</a>.</p> <p><strong>Emmanuel Macron has described the Irish backstop as \u201cindispensable\u201d to a Brexit deal.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/22/emmanuel-macron-backs-month-of-talks-to-agree-brexit-deal\">The French president has told Boris Johnson</a> the EU would like \u201cvisibility\u201d on London\u2019s proposals for the UK\u2019s withdrawal within a month.</p> <p><strong>Brazil\u2019s environment minister has been booed at a climate event</strong>, as fires continue to sweep through the Amazon rainforest<strong>. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/22/brazilian-minister-booed-at-climate-event-as-outcry-grows-over-amazon-fires\">The fires are up by more than 80% compared with last year</a>, according to Brazil\u2019s space research institute.</p> <p><strong>The Grand Designs star Kevin McCloud\u2019s property empire has turned into a nightmare</strong>,<strong> </strong>with<strong> </strong>small investors who sank millions of pounds into his eco-friendly housing ventures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/22/investors-kevin-mccloud-property-schemes-huge-losses\">told they could face losing up to 97% of their money</a>.</p> <p><strong>Police in California appear to have thwarted a mass shooting</strong>, arresting a hotel cook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/22/mass-shooting-hotel-worker-arrest-guns-arsenal-long-beach-california\">who had amassed an astonishing cache of powerful firearms</a>.</p> <p><strong>And a small town outside Barcelona is using wolf urine to deter wild boar.</strong> After trying a variety of deterrents, the town council of Aiguafreda has agreed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/22/town-near-barcelona-uses-wolf-urine-to-keep-wild-boar-away\">to see if the smell of the pheromones of the wild pigs\u2019 principal predator</a> will keep them at bay.</p> <h2>Opinion and analysis</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d19fff3841d62e21d4006915712ebc39a8e8d35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d19fff3841d62e21d4006915712ebc39a8e8d35/0_0_6048_4024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abortion protest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-abortion and pro-choice advocates hold a protest rally outside the NSW parliament this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>According to self-identified \u201cpro-life\u201d advocates, the fundamental divide between those who want to outlaw abortion and those who want it to be legal comes down to one question: when does life begin? </strong>Anti-abortion advocacy pushes the conceit that opposition to abortion rights is simply about wanting to save human lives, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/22/a-new-poll-shows-what-really-interests-pro-lifers-controlling-women\">writes Jill Filipovic</a>: \u201cBut a new US poll shows that\u2019s a lie. The \u2018pro-life\u2019 movement is fundamentally about misogyny. A Supermajority/PerryUndem survey released this week divides respondents by their position on abortion, and then tracks their answers to 10 questions on gender equality more generally. On every question, anti-abortion voters were significantly more hostile to gender equity than pro-choice voters. In other words, pro-lifers are sexists in denial \u2013 yes, the women too.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Donald Trump is not known for his love of 12th-century English history.</strong> But there are echoes of the clash between Henry II and Thomas Becket in the president\u2019s troubled relationship with Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/22/wall-street-white-house-trump-federal-reserve-powell-recession\">writes Larry Elliott</a>: \u201cIf Powell feels beleaguered as he prepares to make the most important speech in his 18 months in the job on Friday, then that\u2019s hardly surprising. The world\u2019s most powerful banker has Wall Street and the White House on his back, both howling for more stimulus. Like Henry II, Trump has only himself to blame.

In August 2018 an exclusive analysis of 10 years of coronial data found 407 Indigenous people had died in police or prison custody since the end of the royal commission in 1991; as of today, that figure has increased to 424. In that time, the federal government has failed to respond to two major reviews, and only three jurisdictions \u2013 Western Australia, Victoria and the Northern Territory \u2013 have implemented a custody notification service to match the life-saving program operating in NSW. Logging is causing Melbourne\u2019s main catchment to miss out on 15,000 megalitres of water each year, equivalent to the amount used by 250,000 people, a study has found. Researchers from the Australian National University said logging in the catchment made little economic sense, given the water lost was worth far more than the timber, most of which is used to make paper. The Thomson catchment, to the city\u2019s north-east, is Melbourne\u2019s most important, feeding a reservoir that provides nearly 60% of the city\u2019s water storage capacity. Australian cheesemakers are mobilising against a proposed European crackdown on the naming of hundreds of products \u2013 including feta, mozzarella and gorgonzola \u2013 warning not only of job losses but of a degradation of Australia\u2019s rich multicultural history. As part of negotiations between Australia and the EU over a new free trade agreement, the EU has put forward a list of geographic indicators that it believes Australian producers should not be able to use. The ruling would capture many Australian producers with European ancestry who have continued the food tradition and methods of their forebears. Under the proposed changes, the EU would ban Australia using the names of 236 beverages and 172 foods, including 56 cheeses. World An attempt to repatriate 3,000 Rohingya Muslims who fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh has failed. The Myanmar government had approved the attempt but, as also happened in November, none of the refugees agreed to voluntarily board the buses. Emmanuel Macron has described the Irish backstop as \u201cindispensable\u201d to a Brexit deal. The French president has told Boris Johnson the EU would like \u201cvisibility\u201d on London\u2019s proposals for the UK\u2019s withdrawal within a month. Brazil\u2019s environment minister has been booed at a climate event, as fires continue to sweep through the Amazon rainforest. The fires are up by more than 80% compared with last year, according to Brazil\u2019s space research institute. The Grand Designs star Kevin McCloud\u2019s property empire has turned into a nightmare, with small investors who sank millions of pounds into his eco-friendly housing ventures told they could face losing up to 97% of their money. Police in California appear to have thwarted a mass shooting, arresting a hotel cook who had amassed an astonishing cache of powerful firearms. And a small town outside Barcelona is using wolf urine to deter wild boar. After trying a variety of deterrents, the town council of Aiguafreda has agreed to see if the smell of the pheromones of the wild pigs\u2019 principal predator will keep them at bay. Opinion and analysis According to self-identified \u201cpro-life\u201d advocates, the fundamental divide between those who want to outlaw abortion and those who want it to be legal comes down to one question: when does life begin? Anti-abortion advocacy pushes the conceit that opposition to abortion rights is simply about wanting to save human lives, writes Jill Filipovic: \u201cBut a new US poll shows that\u2019s a lie. The \u2018pro-life\u2019 movement is fundamentally about misogyny. A Supermajority/PerryUndem survey released this week divides respondents by their position on abortion, and then tracks their answers to 10 questions on gender equality more generally. On every question, anti-abortion voters were significantly more hostile to gender equity than pro-choice voters. In other words, pro-lifers are sexists in denial \u2013 yes, the women too.\u201d Donald Trump is not known for his love of 12th-century English history. But there are echoes of the clash between Henry II and Thomas Becket in the president\u2019s troubled relationship with Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, writes Larry Elliott: \u201cIf Powell feels beleaguered as he prepares to make the most important speech in his 18 months in the job on Friday, then that\u2019s hardly surprising. The world\u2019s most powerful banker has Wall Street and the White House on his back, both howling for more stimulus. Like Henry II, Trump has only himself to blame. He appointed someone he thought he could trust to do a job, and that person has failed to do what was expected of him \u2026 This won\u2019t end well.\u201d Sport Australia is in trouble on the opening day of the third Ashes Test at Headingley, after an extraordinary performance by Jofra Archer, who took six wickets for 45. Australia collapsed from 136-2 to 179 all out on a dramatic, rain-affected day of play. Serena Williams has been paired with Maria Sharapova in an eye-catching US Open first round encounter. Williams and Sharapova have met in the finals of the other three majors and the 2012 Olympics but have yet to face each other in the US Open. And umpiring Australian rules football has always been one of the toughest gigs in sport. But has the AFL reached a point where it is just about impossible to adjudicate? Thinking time: The snake epidemic eating away at Florida On a Thursday afternoon in St Petersburg, Florida, Beth Koehler crouches over a cairn terrier named Ginger, trimming intently as fur collects around her feet. On Koehler\u2019s arm is a scratch \u2013 red, jagged and freshly acquired, though not in the way one might expect of a dog groomer. \u201cThere was no way I could pin the head,\u201d Koehler says, referring to the snake that was partly responsible. She had grabbed hold however she could, which made it \u201cpissed\u201d: \u201cIt decided to coil up and just throw itself at me.\u201d Startled, Koehler fell backwards, cutting herself on a vine \u2013 an injury far preferable to the bite of a Burmese python. It\u2019s estimated that there are tens of thousands of pythons now living in the Florida wild, and they have no natural predators. A 2012 study in the Everglades suggested that a disturbing number of mammals have been swallowed by the invasive species: a spike in python sightings since 2000 coincided with a more than 90% reduction in raccoons, opossums and rabbits. Damage done by the pythons to south Florida ecosystems has become so acute that the quest to stop them has turned into a collective crusade. But can the spread of the pythons be halted? Media roundup The Australian reports that Scott Morrison has vowed to stand with Vietnam to push for a free and open Indo-Pacific, amid growing Chinese pressure on the south-east Asian nation. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that private investment funds are circling Australia\u2019s Clean Energy Finance Corporation, hoping for a sale of the $10bn government-owned organisation. And the ABC reports that Australia\u2019s permanent migration intake could drop by more than 10,000 people this year, due to two changes introduced by the federal government. Coming up Scott Morrison continues his official visit to Vietnam. The Wallabies coach, Michael Cheika, will announce the squad he will take to Japan for the Rugby World Cup, which starts next month.

      "bodyText": "Prince Andrew was seen inside the New York apartment of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein getting a foot massage from a young woman, according to an email exchange between a prominent US literary agent and author and writer Evgeny Morozov. In the exchange, published in the New Republic magazine, agent John Brockman recommends to writer Morozov (who he represents as literary agent) that he meet with Epstein, calling him a \u201cbillionaire science philanthropist\u201d who has \u201cbeen extremely generous in funding projects of many of our friends and clients\u201d. Epstein, 66, killed himself on 10 August in New York while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He was accused of abusing underage girls and reportedly making some of them pleasure several of his rich and powerful friends. In the piece in the New Republic Morozov explains that he is on the point of cutting ties with Brockman on account of the agent\u2019s continuing silence over his connections to Epstein.. \u201cJohn has been in the news because of his troubling connections to Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d writes Morozov. He then cites an email exchange between himself and Brockman from 2013 which includes references to Prince Andrew\u2019s foot massage: \u201cIt\u2019s been more than a month since Epstein was arrested on the latest charges. Still, no word on the issue. And, now that I\u2019ve found that old email he sent me, I cannot believe that he knew absolutely nothing of Epstein\u2019s wild sexual escapades.\u201d Having detailed the contents of the email exchange Morozov concludes, \u201cI am ready to pull the plug on my association with Brockman\u2019s agency until and unless he clarifies the relationship between him \u2026 and Epstein.\u201d The Guardian wrote about Epstein\u2019s friendships with a host of renowned scientists, some of whom were introduced by Brockman. The Guardian has contacted Brockman and not yet received a reply. Brockman also declined to respond to Morozov\u2019s request for comment in the New Republic. In the emails between Morozov (a regular contributor to the Guardian) and Brockman, dated 12 September 2013, the literary agent recounts visiting Epstein at his Manhattan house. He writes: \u201cLast time I visited his house (the largest private residence in NYC), I walked in to find him in a sweatsuit and a British guy in a suit with suspenders [braces], getting foot massages from two young well-dressed Russian women.\u201d \u201cAfter grilling me for a while about cyber-security, the Brit, named Andy, was commenting on the Swedish authorities and the charges against Julian Assange. We think they\u2019re liberal in Sweden, but its more like Northern England as opposed to Southern Europe,\u201d Brockman reports \u201cAndy\u201d as saying. Brockman writes that Andrew then complained about his public profile. \u201cIn Monaco, Albert works 12 hours a day but at 9pm, when he goes out, he does whatever he wants, and nobody cares. But, if I do it, I\u2019m in big trouble,\u201d the emails describe him saying. At that point, Brockman writes: \u201cI realized that the recipient of Irina\u2019s foot massage was his Royal Highness, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York.\u201d Buckingham Palace has previously said Andrew was appalled by recent revelations about Epstein. The palace declined to comment on the contents of the email on Thursday night but reiterated its previous statement: \u201cAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.\u201d Brockman concludes the email by writing that a week later \u201con a slow news day the cover of the NYPost had a full-page photo of Jeffrey and Andrew walking in Central Park under the headline: \u2018The Prince and the Perv.\u2019 (That was the end of Andrew\u2019s role at the UK trade ambassador.)\u201d The email exchange \u2013 which the New Republic posted online in full \u2013 took place almost three years after Prince Andrew, who has strenuously denied any involvement in Epstein\u2019s alleged sex trafficking crimes, was photographed walking in New York\u2019s Central Park with Epstein. A video taken a day later, on 10 December 2010, showed the duke waving goodbye to a dark-haired woman, identified in media reports as Katherine Keating, daughter of the former Australian prime minister Paul Keating. Brockman is a literary agent who has represented famous science authors. He also heads the Edge Foundation which seeks to spark debate and conversations between scientists, artists and intellectuals. Ultimately Morozov says he declined Brockman\u2019s invitation to meet with Epstein. Buckingham Palace has strenuously denied any allegations of wrongdoing linked to his relationship with Epstein. In a statement released on Sunday, Buckingham Palace said Andrew was \u201cappalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes\u201d. It said he \u201cdeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent\u201d. Andrew reportedly met Epstein in the late 1990s, after being introduced by Epstein\u2019s then girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the press baron Robert Maxwell. Ghislaine Maxwell, whose whereabouts are currently unknown, has previously denied any wrongdoing. It was in Maxwell\u2019s London home that a photograph was taken in 2001 capturing Andrew with his arm around Virginia Giuffre \u2013 a 17-year-old, then known as Virginia Roberts, who has alleged in court documents that Epstein coerced her into \u201csexual relations\u201d with Andrew in London, New York and on Epstein\u2019s private island in the US Virgin Islands. When they emerged those allegations also prompted a forceful denial from Buckingham Palace, which vehemently denied there was \u201cany form of sexual contact or relationship\u201d between Andrew and Giuffre. \u201cThe allegations made are false and without any foundation,\u201d the statement said.

It was, too, if you only knew which way Bill\u2019s mother\u2019s was. Somewhere beyond the Western Terrace, you guess, where the horizon was beginning to turn blurry, as though Jack Russell, who was here working on a picture of the grand new stand, had just smudged the paint with his finger. \u201cGood toss to lose, I reckon.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/22/england-australia-third-ashes-test-day-one-match-report\">Jofra Archer rips through Australia to boost England in third Ashes Test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A little local knowledge goes a long way here in Leeds. Joe Root, who has been playing at Headingley for 12 years, knew exactly what he wanted to do. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a bowl,\u201d he said, after they had finally found the coin, which had bounced off one of the TV cameras. Tim Paine insisted that he would have batted anyway. Paine is the only player in the Australian team who has played a Test here before, against Pakistan in a series on neutral ground back in 2010. Maybe he had forgotten that Ricky Ponting chose to bat first in that match too, and that Australia then got turned over for 88.</p> <p>Paine might have had a few flashbacks to it when Stuart Broad started from the Kirkstall Lane End. It was one of those ominous overs that must have left the Australian batsmen feeling pretty queasy about the day ahead.</p> <p>Broad\u2019s fourth ball was the first in a string of unplayable deliveries he bowled from around the wicket to David Warner. It slid in towards him, pitched just outside his off stump and then broke away off the pitch and whizzed past his dangling bat. Warner smiled, shrugged and set himself ready for the next one. There wasn\u2019t a whole lot else he could do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b066ed440e8aaa9429661183816570457395c13f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b066ed440e8aaa9429661183816570457395c13f/0_51_4056_2435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Broad wheels away after cleaning bowling Head.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broad wheels away after cleaning bowling Head.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is turning into an interesting summer for Broad. At the beginning, it wasn\u2019t even clear whether or not he would play every Test since he was competing, all of a sudden, with a couple of younger and quicker bowlers in Jofra Archer and Olly Stone. But that injury to Jimmy Anderson at Edgbaston has left Broad as the senior member of the team, the old hand of the bowling attack. And he seems to be enjoying himself almost as much as Archer is. Archer had bowled just 10 overs here before, during the match against Sri Lanka in the World Cup, but he still cleaned up six wickets.</p> <p>But then Archer is at the point of his career where it all seems to come easy. Broad has had more than his share of doing hard days in the field. Some of them here. It took him a long time to figure out how to bowl at Headingley.</p> <p>For years he and Anderson didn\u2019t much care for the place. Then they finally realised that they\u2019d both been working from the wrong ends. He has got used to it now, though, and fell immediately into precisely the right length: fuller than usual.</p> <p>Broad\u2019s second over was even better. He beat Warner, once, twice, three times more. Then it started raining. That black stuff from Bill\u2019s mother\u2019s way had finally arrived. It was two o\u2019clock before they got back on again, when Broad immediately beat Warner a fourth time. It was all getting a bit frustrating and then, in the end, he got a wicket with the worst ball he had bowled all day, a half volley down the leg side that Usman Khawaja sliced through behind. By the time the rain returned, Broad was five balls into his eighth over, had bowled three maidens, and taken one for 12.</p> <p>Root had to bring him back into the attack soon enough. Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes bowled some poor stuff in the overs they shared between them either side of tea. You would think they were both naturally well suited to bowling here, but Stokes has taken only five wickets in four Tests, here, and they have cost 57 runs each, and Woakes seven at 35 in three.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/aug/22/ashes-2019-england-v-australia-third-test-day-one-live-headingley\">Ashes 2019: England v Australia third Test, day one \u2013\u00a0live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Warner and Marnus Labuschagne had just settled in when Broad returned to the attack. He beat Warner again in his very first over back, with another ball that nipped away from him.</p> <p>It was a good enough delivery to convince the umpire Chris Gaffeney, who gave it out, but Warner reviewed it and it turned out that the ball had been a hair\u2019s breadth away from his edge. He took it out on Travis Head, who he bowled for a six-ball duck with another of those wicked away-seamers. It was one for his career highlights reel. Then he beat up Labuschagne, too, with a ball that hit him plumb in the box.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Head was Broad\u2019s 44th wicket here, which meant he had pulled level with Fred Trueman as the leading wicket-taker at the ground, although we had best mention that Trueman took his in one fewer Tests, nine rather than 10, and at a lower average, 18 rather than 26, unless all his spinning in the grave triggers an earthquake in the Dales.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The locals \u2013 experts the lot of them \u2013 were packing anoraks, hats and brollies on Thursday morning, a bad sign for all those out-of-towners who had been foolish enough to trust the weather forecast. \u201cIt\u2019s looking a bit black over Bill\u2019s mother\u2019s,\u201d one of them said to another on the short walk up from Burley Park station. It was, too, if you only knew which way Bill\u2019s mother\u2019s was. Somewhere beyond the Western Terrace, you guess, where the horizon was beginning to turn blurry, as though Jack Russell, who was here working on a picture of the grand new stand, had just smudged the paint with his finger. \u201cGood toss to lose, I reckon.\u201d A little local knowledge goes a long way here in Leeds. Joe Root, who has been playing at Headingley for 12 years, knew exactly what he wanted to do. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a bowl,\u201d he said, after they had finally found the coin, which had bounced off one of the TV cameras. Tim Paine insisted that he would have batted anyway. Paine is the only player in the Australian team who has played a Test here before, against Pakistan in a series on neutral ground back in 2010. Maybe he had forgotten that Ricky Ponting chose to bat first in that match too, and that Australia then got turned over for 88. Paine might have had a few flashbacks to it when Stuart Broad started from the Kirkstall Lane End. It was one of those ominous overs that must have left the Australian batsmen feeling pretty queasy about the day ahead. Broad\u2019s fourth ball was the first in a string of unplayable deliveries he bowled from around the wicket to David Warner. It slid in towards him, pitched just outside his off stump and then broke away off the pitch and whizzed past his dangling bat. Warner smiled, shrugged and set himself ready for the next one. There wasn\u2019t a whole lot else he could do. It is turning into an interesting summer for Broad. At the beginning, it wasn\u2019t even clear whether or not he would play every Test since he was competing, all of a sudden, with a couple of younger and quicker bowlers in Jofra Archer and Olly Stone. But that injury to Jimmy Anderson at Edgbaston has left Broad as the senior member of the team, the old hand of the bowling attack. And he seems to be enjoying himself almost as much as Archer is. Archer had bowled just 10 overs here before, during the match against Sri Lanka in the World Cup, but he still cleaned up six wickets. But then Archer is at the point of his career where it all seems to come easy. Broad has had more than his share of doing hard days in the field. Some of them here. It took him a long time to figure out how to bowl at Headingley. For years he and Anderson didn\u2019t much care for the place. Then they finally realised that they\u2019d both been working from the wrong ends. He has got used to it now, though, and fell immediately into precisely the right length: fuller than usual. Broad\u2019s second over was even better. He beat Warner, once, twice, three times more. Then it started raining. That black stuff from Bill\u2019s mother\u2019s way had finally arrived. It was two o\u2019clock before they got back on again, when Broad immediately beat Warner a fourth time. It was all getting a bit frustrating and then, in the end, he got a wicket with the worst ball he had bowled all day, a half volley down the leg side that Usman Khawaja sliced through behind. By the time the rain returned, Broad was five balls into his eighth over, had bowled three maidens, and taken one for 12. Root had to bring him back into the attack soon enough. Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes bowled some poor stuff in the overs they shared between them either side of tea. You would think they were both naturally well suited to bowling here, but Stokes has taken only five wickets in four Tests, here, and they have cost 57 runs each, and Woakes seven at 35 in three. Warner and Marnus Labuschagne had just settled in when Broad returned to the attack. He beat Warner again in his very first over back, with another ball that nipped away from him. It was a good enough delivery to convince the umpire Chris Gaffeney, who gave it out, but Warner reviewed it and it turned out that the ball had been a hair\u2019s breadth away from his edge. He took it out on Travis Head, who he bowled for a six-ball duck with another of those wicked away-seamers. It was one for his career highlights reel. Then he beat up Labuschagne, too, with a ball that hit him plumb in the box. Head was Broad\u2019s 44th wicket here, which meant he had pulled level with Fred Trueman as the leading wicket-taker at the ground, although we had best mention that Trueman took his in one fewer Tests, nine rather than 10, and at a lower average, 18 rather than 26, unless all his spinning in the grave triggers an earthquake in the Dales.",

Steve Dale, who bought the indebted and overspending club for \u00a31 in December, has failed to satisfy the EFL he has the funds to pay Bury\u2019s debts and the \u00a31.5m running costs for the season. Jevans said he must do so by the deadline or be in serious, \u201cdeep\u201d talks to sell the club, otherwise Bury will be expelled.</p> \n<p>Given Friday\u2019s midnight deadline, the EFL board is expected to meet by telephone on Saturday morning if the deadline is not extended to consider Dale\u2019s response and if it is deemed inadequate the club could be expelled after 125 years of Football League membership.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/21/losing-bury-would-devastate-a-community\">Bury are an extension of family, losing them would devastate a community | James Bentley</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Jevans said that after the Bury crisis has been dealt with, the EFL\u2019s review of its \u201cfit and proper person\u201d ownership rules and governance will examine how it came to happen, \u201cand make sure it didn\u2019t happen again\u201d.</p> \n<p>Frith said there were \u201cinterested parties preparing credible bids\u201d and he asked Adams to intervene with the league.

Dale said he had become involved in the football club for \u201cphilanthropic\u201d reasons after suffering from illness but many Bury supporters were immediately concerned that his business record appeared to consist largely of buying failing companies, selling their assets and seeing them liquidated or dissolved.</p> \n<p>The EFL then confirmed that although Dale passed its \u201cowners and directors test\u201d because he has no criminal convictions, he never provided proof of his \u201csource and sufficiency of funding\u201d, which league rules require of prospective owners before a takeover, or within 10 days afterwards.</p> \n<p>Dale then formed two separate companies, one of which, Bury Heritage, was used to take ownership of the club\u2019s historic trophies and memorabilia; Dale publicly denied this was \u201casset stripping\u201d, saying it was for safekeeping, because \u201cdebt collectors\u201d were seeking to seize them.

      "bodyText": "The sports minister, Nigel Adams, has agreed to ask the English Football League to extend Friday\u2019s 11:59pm deadline for the expulsion of Bury, following a request by the Bury North MP James Frith. The EFL\u2019s executive chair, Debbie Jevans, said on Thursday the deadline would be extended only if there is a \u201ctangible\u201d reason such as realistic takeover negotiations and even then only by a day or two. Steve Dale, who bought the indebted and overspending club for \u00a31 in December, has failed to satisfy the EFL he has the funds to pay Bury\u2019s debts and the \u00a31.5m running costs for the season. Jevans said he must do so by the deadline or be in serious, \u201cdeep\u201d talks to sell the club, otherwise Bury will be expelled. Given Friday\u2019s midnight deadline, the EFL board is expected to meet by telephone on Saturday morning if the deadline is not extended to consider Dale\u2019s response and if it is deemed inadequate the club could be expelled after 125 years of Football League membership. Jevans said that after the Bury crisis has been dealt with, the EFL\u2019s review of its \u201cfit and proper person\u201d ownership rules and governance will examine how it came to happen, \u201cand make sure it didn\u2019t happen again\u201d. Frith said there were \u201cinterested parties preparing credible bids\u201d and he asked Adams to intervene with the league. Jevans confirmed the EFL had put one such group in touch with Dale but Dale told the Guardian that discussions with that group had not moved further than requests for information and that negotiations with the former Port Vale owner Norman Smurthwaite had not resulted in any agreement. Dale did not say how he was planning to satisfy the league by the deadline with the evidence it requires of his funding and thereby avoid the expulsion of the club, a prospect causing deep distress to lifelong supporters and the small Greater Manchester town. Bury\u2019s first five League One matches have been suspended by the EFL because of its questions over Dale\u2019s funding and would need to be replayed. The league cannot sanction excessive fixture congestion later in the season. \u201cIt would be a very short delay \u2013 24, maybe 48 hours,\u201d Jevans said. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep postponing matches. If there is a potential purchaser they would have to give us something tangible but time is running out.\u201d Jevans said she would be \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d if Bury were expelled on these grounds but said: \u201cIf that does happen, I will also know the board has done everything.\u201d Devastated Bury supporters will, however, have some very challenging questions for the EFL and its processes if the club are dealt so dire a blow due to the actions of a \u00a31 buyer in sole charge for nine months. Dale agreed the Bury takeover rapidly in December with the former owner Stewart Day, a property developer who was facing several of his companies falling into multimillion-pound insolvencies leaving scores of investors unpaid. Dale said he had become involved in the football club for \u201cphilanthropic\u201d reasons after suffering from illness but many Bury supporters were immediately concerned that his business record appeared to consist largely of buying failing companies, selling their assets and seeing them liquidated or dissolved. The EFL then confirmed that although Dale passed its \u201cowners and directors test\u201d because he has no criminal convictions, he never provided proof of his \u201csource and sufficiency of funding\u201d, which league rules require of prospective owners before a takeover, or within 10 days afterwards. Dale then formed two separate companies, one of which, Bury Heritage, was used to take ownership of the club\u2019s historic trophies and memorabilia; Dale publicly denied this was \u201casset stripping\u201d, saying it was for safekeeping, because \u201cdebt collectors\u201d were seeking to seize them. The company voluntary arrangement passed in July, which promises to pay \u00a34m of \u201cnon-football\u201d creditors a quarter of what they are owed, stated that Dale\u2019s company had paid for the trophies following an independent valuation. He formed the other company, Bury Leisure, to take ownership of the ground; Dale said his intention was to pay off a \u00a33.2m mortgage on Gigg Lane, then have the club reimburse him by paying rent. That transfer has not happened and the mortgage taken out in stages by Day with Capital Bridging Finance Solutions remains in place. In May last season\u2019s promotion-winning squad revealed they had not been paid since February and called on Dale to go, then several club staff were sacked by a letter telling them the club was insolvent. Although some payment has since been made to players and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association has provided loans for part of the players\u2019 wages, Bury\u2019s captain, Stephen Dawson, voiced extraordinary criticism of Dale during an interview on TalkSport last week, calling Dale a liar and accusing him of not having the necessary money. Following that on-air exchange the club secretary Jill Neville, mother of Gary, Phil and Tracey and wife of the club\u2019s late commercial director Neville Neville, handed her resignation to Dale, after 35 years\u2019 service. Dale himself submitted a claim to the CVA process that the club owed him \u00a33.86m, which was understood to be loans made by Day which had been assigned to Dale. The administrator of Mederco, one of Day\u2019s insolvent property companies, then claimed it had loaned Bury more than \u00a37m during Day\u2019s five-year tenure. The administrator then sold that debt for a hundredth of its value, \u00a370,000, to a newly formed company, RCR Holdings, based in Chadderton, Oldham. RCR and Dale wielded the crucial weight of their debts to vote through the CVA, which was opposed by HMRC, who were owed \u00a31.1m in unpaid taxes, and several other creditors. In his letter to Jevans, Frith called for an investigation into that deal, claiming it \u201craises serious questions as to the relationship between Mederco (and their administrators), RCR Holdings and the current owners [Steve Dale],\u201d and suggested he may use parliamentary privilege to talk about it in the House of Commons. Dale told the Guardian that RCR Holdings is looking for 25% of its \u00a37m \u2013 \u00a31.75m \u2013 in the CVA, although the minutes of the creditors\u2019 meeting suggest the company\u2019s representative said it was not seeking a return if \u201can increase in funds [for the CVA] be required.\u201d Dale therefore puts the total due to non-football creditors under the CVA as around \u00a33.2m; Jevans, who was referring to the figure before the RCR claim, said it is around \u00a31.2m.

The union has also voiced concern about the company\u2019s decision to move its Parcelforce business to a separate legal entity. Parcelforce has previously attracted criticism over the employment conditions faced by drivers, some of whom claimed they were charged \u00a3250 a day if they were off sick.",

One of these spin-offs, Kevin\u2019s Grandest Design, is due to screen on 28 August. Separately, McCloud set up HAB Housing in 2007 \u201cto challenge the way identikit volume housing was built in the UK\u201d.</p> <p>McCloud has repeatedly turned to the public to help fund a series of eco-friendly developments. In 2013, HAB Housing <a href=\"https://www.crowdcube.com/explore/blog/investing/kevin-mcclouds-hab-housing-tops-equity-crowdfunding-world-record-with-1-9m-investment-on-crowdcube\">reportedly broke the then world record</a> for crowdfunded investment with 650 people putting in \u00a31.9m. Then came the January 2017 mini-bond scheme, which raised \u00a32.4m for HAB Land. Later that year, McCloud announced that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/04/grand-designs-presenter-kevin-mccloud-seeks-to-raise-50m-to-build-600-homes-a-year\">looking to raise up to \u00a350m</a> through another bond for private investors.</p> <p>During the past few days, the January 2017 bond investors have received a letter from HAB Land Finance which stated that \u201cafter final completion of the projects at both Kings Worthy and Cumnor Hill [in Oxford], the net return available to bondholders would be expected to range from \u00a3606,000 (best case) to \u00a369,000 (worse case) which, in each case, is equivalent to 26 pence and 3 pence for every \u00a31 of bond monies invested\u201d.

As a result the company has proposed a restructuring of the bonds whereby investors would not see any of their cash back until 2024 at the earliest.</p> <p>The letter says HAB Land would be unable to continue to trade without a further injection of funds.

The last time I felt this excited about a sportsman was when Michael van Gerwen went into overdrive in the winter of 2012. Like van Gerwen, Archer will eventually become better than he is now. But he will never be more exciting.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-22T19:00:52.727Z\">at 8.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d5edf5d8f08a0805bcc2c82\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-22T18:31:46.445Z\">7.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jofra Archer: 17.1-3-45-6. </strong>This is his second Test match.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-22T18:49:52.183Z\">at 7.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d5edf208f081cf11cf1b4ec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-22T18:30:47.472Z\">7.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Lyon whipped around his pad and was plumb LBW.</strong> He wanted to review, but Australia had none left.

In the old days, Test-standard players ended up skippering county sides all the time as they were typically the best at their clubs and played lots of county games. So they learnt how to do it and we all got to see who was any good. Now this never happens as contracted players are hardly ever seen in the shires. Result: hardly any international players have first-class captaincy experience. So here we are.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Yep, I completely agree with this. Unless you come into the England side fairly late in your career - like, say, Andrew Strauss, or perhaps Rory Burns - it\u2019s almost impossible to get any useful captaincy experience beforehand. When England do change captain, be it next month or in 2023, I hope they consider appointing a specialist.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d5ecd078f08a0805bcc2be8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-22T17:18:07.007Z\">6.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>39th over: Australia 149-5 (Labuschagne 52, Paine 8)</strong> Labuschagne pulls Broad round the corner for a single.

What led to him becoming unselectable during the tour of hell? He seems to have fizzled out of favour ever since. For the last few seasons, I forlornly check Middlesex\u2019s score cards and county averages, in the hope to see him surging back to form, only to see he rarely gets picked. I\u2019d love for somebody like Gideon Haigh or Simon Wilde to write a book really going into the full details. Was it confidence? Form? Injury? Giles? Saker? Flower? Cook? Morgan?\u201d</p> \n  <p>I don\u2019t know him, but I\u2019m fairly sure the biggest factor, by some distance, was confidence. A few other things certainly didn\u2019t help, like the Graeme Smith no-ball and being dropped in his first two Ashes series. The thing that confuses me about Finn is that he had a glorious comeback in 2015, and it seemed like he\u2019d conquered all the demons. I\u2019m not sure he ever bowled better for England than during the Boxing Day Test in Durban. But the following summer he struggled again, and he played what will almost certainly be his last Test at the age of 27.

Sure enough, Broad is right back on it, Warner this time leaving close to the off-stump. <strong>And he is up for lbw to finish! It looks to be angling down leg</strong> and is given not out.

I stand by that call. In the last week or so, things have moved on so rapidly it is almost impossible to imagine him being recalled: the King is dead, long live the King.

We move to Manchester with Smith and Anderson returning. I\u2019ll have all of that. To your broader point, I never really expected him to go beyond this Ashes - right?

According to guitar virtuoso Michael Chapman, this had a simple cause: the local police wouldn\u2019t permit Tetley\u2019s and rock\u2019n\u2019roll to coexist in the same building. I suspect the prohibition was broader than just Tetley\u2019s but that\u2019s just a detail.\u201d</p> \n  <p>I\u2019m really looking forward to a frolic this weekend.

With Woods and Stone out for the series, would he be in contention if there were a couple of injuries in the existing seam department?\u201d </p> \n  <p>I suspect not?

Would make a great story. </p> \n  <p>Scott Robert on him too. \u201cTom Carver makes a very good point about Steven Finn\u2019s issues with bowling from close to the stumps, but I believe that good old David Saker was incredibly culpable in destroying Finn\u2019s action, as he has tried to do with Stokes\u2019s. You watch Stokes\u2019s action when he first started playing, and even though he had the mad, curved run-up, he arrived at the crease very close to the stumps and rotated beautifully around his sideways on action, swinging the ball away from the right handers. If you watch him now, he doesn\u2019t get as close to the stumps, and his arm goes beyond the perpendicular, meaning he closes his upper body off and can only angle the ball into the right hander. He\u2019s lost his away swing. You could see exactly the same thing started happening with Finn. If you\u2019re as sad as me, you can see the metamorphosis of both of their actions via the youtubes.\u201d</p> \n  <p>There\u2019s a lot going on here.

The reason Archer hits so many batsman (11 times) last Test, is that there is no difference in his action when he bowls a full length or a short one, which makes him unique, added to that he bowls from so close to the stumps that the batsman has no angle to work with. So much of facing fast bowling is anticipation and looking for the slightest tell to help you react in time, because there are none with Archer you simply don\u2019t have time to get out of the road.

The best bowlers are fresh, the ball swings, the nicks carry and the slip cordon is well-populated.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/21/england-australia-ashes-openers-vic-marks-headingley-cricket\">England and Australia openers under scrutiny amid Ashes uncertainty | Vic Marks</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d5e26528f084061ab38a60f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-22T09:08:49.535Z\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Pitch</strong>: Reports from the middle are coming back indicating the deck will be dry and already hinting at cracking.

      "bodyText": "To the lions ... Broad is loving Leeds ... Archer is quite happy ... I\u2019ll leave you with a match report from Headingley. I\u2019m off to give thanks for Jofra Archer, as an England fan, a cricket fan and a life fan. Bye! That was a helluva day\u2019s play. England started well, were a borderline disgrace for an hour after tea, and then Jofra Archer sparked a stunning Australian collapse. Whatever happens with Archer, and I\u2019m not ruling out 801 Test wickets at an average of 12, we will be talking about the events of the last six days forever. There\u2019s nothing in sport, and not much in life, that is as exhilarating as watching the sudden emergence of a rare talent - not a good player, not even a potentially great one, but a potential all-time great. The last time I felt this excited about a sportsman was when Michael van Gerwen went into overdrive in the winter of 2012. Like van Gerwen, Archer will eventually become better than he is now. But he will never be more exciting. Jofra Archer: 17.1-3-45-6. This is his second Test match. Lyon whipped around his pad and was plumb LBW. He wanted to review, but Australia had none left. Australia have lost their last eight wickets for 43 runs. Eight Australian wickets for 43 at Headingley: that rings a bell. He needs just one ball to finish the job; of course he does. Jofra Archer will bowl the final over of the day. 52nd over: Australia 179-9 (Lyon 1, Hazlewood 1) Australia have lost seven wickets for 41. He\u2019s out! That was a strange dismissal, a dipping full toss from Stokes that hit Labuschagne on both pads and knocked him off his feet. Replays showed it was hitting the stumps. Labuschagne looks unhappy, perhaps with the light. He ended up lying on his front, an undignified end to a fantastic innings. Labuschagne is given out LBW - but he\u2019s reviewed. 51st over: Australia 175-8 (Labuschagne 72, Lyon 0) The forecast is much better tomorrow. You can never be too sure with Headingley, but England should have a great opportunity to take a big first-innings lead. Should. 50th over: Australia 174-8 (Labuschagne 71, Lyon 0) \u201cFast bowlers, in their first series, are traditionally described as \u2018raw\u2019, but Jofra is very smart indeed isn\u2019t he?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cLike the young Michael Holding, the fire had plenty of brains directing it.\u201d He really is. And he can bowl forever, peaking at 96mph in his sixth or seventh spell of the innings. There must be a catch, but I\u2019ve no idea what it is. It already feels like I\u2019m watching the best England bowler I\u2019ll ever see. It hurts my head to think how good he might be at 28. Cummins was very confused by that decision. He was certain he hadn\u2019t nicked it. He threw the bat at a wide one, and there was a noise as it passed the bat. There was a spike on Ultra-Edge \u2013 but the spike started before the ball went past the edge. Who knows. I suppose there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to overturn the on-field decision, although my instinct is that he didn\u2019t hit it. What we do know for certain is that Jofra Archer has his first Test five-for. Insight department: it won\u2019t be his last. He\u2019s given him out! Jofra Archer has his first Test five-for! Or maybe not, because Cummins has reviewed. 49th over: Australia 173-7 (Labuschagne 71, Cummins 0) Labuschagne, as Ricky Ponting observes on Sky, has left the ball immaculately today - and he does so again during a maiden from Woakes. There aren\u2019t many frills to his batting, but he knows his game like the back of his bat. \u201cI\u2019m really hoping that we get to see Jofra and Jimmy bowling in tandem at least a few times,\u201d says Tom Hopkins. \u201cThe thought of Jimmy\u2019s control and Jofra\u2019s fire dovetailing is really quite appealing.\u201d 48th over: Australia 173-7 (Labuschagne 71, Cummins 0) Cummins is beaten by a hot one outside off stump, but that aside he defends with his usual solidity. He\u2019s such an impressive lower-order batsman. \u201cJofra for BBC Sports Personality of the Year?\u201d wonders Will Buckley. It\u2019s a sore subject. He wasn\u2019t even on the list (200-1 bar) before the World Cup, and I was tempted to put money on it. But I never really bet, and I simply couldn\u2019t be bothered to request a bet, or whatever it\u2019s called. 47th over: Australia 173-7 (Labuschagne 71, Cummins 0) A maiden from Woakes to Labuschagne, which means Archer will resume his battle with Pat Cummins. 46th over: Australia 173-7 (Labuschagne 71, Cummins 0) What have we done to deserve Jofra Archer? The scary thing about Archer is that he hasn\u2019t bowled that well today - yet he now has figures of 4-44. Pattinson edges an excellent delivery to first slip, where Root takes a really sharp catch. That was too good for a lower-order batsman. 45th over: Australia 171-6 (Labuschagne 70, Pattinson 1) Bad light is going to stop play very soon. Pattinson works Woakes off the hip to get off the mark, and then Labuschagne nails a drive behind square for four. He has played expertly in tough conditions. 44th over: Australia 164-6 (Labuschagne 64, Pattinson 0) Here\u2019s Jofra. The light is fading, so Labuschagne makes sure Pattinson is not exposed and the over passes without incident. That was pretty selfless batting. 43rd over: Australia 162-6 (Labuschagne 62, Pattinson 0) Australia have lost four wickets for 26, and Paine has only 77 runs in five innings this series. Paine\u2019s head fell over towards the off side as he pushed around his front pad at a good delivery from Woakes, delivered from wider on the crease. I thought the angle was taking it past leg stump - or at best hitting the outside of the stump - but Root reviewed almost instantly and Hawkeye had it smacking into leg stump. That\u2019s a fine breakthrough for England, who are having an excellent end to this peculiar day. He\u2019s out! That\u2019s a brilliant review from Joe Root. England review for LBW against Tim Paine. I think this will be umpire\u2019s call at best for England. 42nd over: Australia 160-5 (Labuschagne 62, Paine 11) Labuschagne, the spelling of whose surname causes me almost as much bother as haemorrhoids, pulls Stokes smoothly for two. With that, the umpires call for drinks. There\u2019s an hour of play remaining, caveats permitting. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cMarnus Labuschagne is not the worst advert for looking at form in county cricket is he?\u201d Form in Division Two, too. There are, as Selve pointed out the other day, some very good attacks in that division this year. 41st over: Australia 160-5 (Labuschagne 60, Paine 11) Labuschagne is beaten, chasing a very wide tempter from Broad. He reproaches himself and, for his penance, ignores a series of similar deliveries thereafter. When Broad adjusts his line for the last ball of the over, Labuschagne thick edges for three. 40th over: Australia 157-5 (Labuschagne 57, Paine 11) A brilliant delivery from Stokes turns Labuschagne round, takes the edge and flies just wide of the diving Burns at gully for four. \u201cI agree there is no obvious new captain,\u201d says Simon Yates. \u201cPersonal view - this is one of the few downsides of central contracts. In the old days, Test-standard players ended up skippering county sides all the time as they were typically the best at their clubs and played lots of county games. So they learnt how to do it and we all got to see who was any good. Now this never happens as contracted players are hardly ever seen in the shires. Result: hardly any international players have first-class captaincy experience. So here we are.\u201d Yep, I completely agree with this. Unless you come into the England side fairly late in your career - like, say, Andrew Strauss, or perhaps Rory Burns - it\u2019s almost impossible to get any useful captaincy experience beforehand. When England do change captain, be it next month or in 2023, I hope they consider appointing a specialist. 39th over: Australia 149-5 (Labuschagne 52, Paine 8) Labuschagne pulls Broad round the corner for a single. These are the brighest conditions of the whole day, and batting looks a bit more comfortable as a result. Saying which, Labuschagne is flat on his back after being hit in the sweet spot by Broad. He really felt that, and there\u2019s a break in play while he receives whatever treatment you can receive in such circumstances. 38th over: Australia 145-5 (Labuschagne 51, Paine 6) Stokes replaces Archer; nothing happens. The light has improved considerably inthe last 10 minutes, so play could continue until 7.30pm. \u201cThe scoreboard may be looking a lot healthier but this feels a pretty odd day given how we finished the Lord\u2019s Test,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cI like Root so much, but this team feels like an endless discussion around potential, rather than delivering. Like Cook, he was next off the rank, but when does the learning excuse end? He should be freed up to pile on runs at No4, but the Morgan/Brearley theory aside, where does a successor come from, given we\u2019re not even sure what our best order is? It\u2019s like we\u2019ve got all the right instruments but we can\u2019t find the right tune.\u201d No idea. Making Stokes vice-captain has complicated things as well. I suspect Buttler would be the best captain of the current team, but his place isn\u2019t guaranteed and he will probably become ODI/T20 captain in the next year. He can\u2019t do all three. 37th over: Australia 145-5 (Labuschagne 51, Paine 5) England know the light could go at any time. They\u2019d love to take one more wicket and start afresh against the bowlers tomorrow (if Pat Cummins can be described as such). Broad bowls a maiden to Labuschagne, who had been comfortably the most, erm, comfortable of the Australian batsmen. 36th over: Australia 145-5 (Labuschagne 51, Paine 5) Jofra Archer currently has a Test bowling average of 16.37. Not even he will be able to sustain that, but it would surprise nobody if he became the first England bowler since Fred Trueman when to end a long Test career with an average below 25. Paine, turned round by a good delivery earlier in the over, gets his first boundary by pinging Archer through mid-off. Good shot. 35th over: Australia 141-5 (Labuschagne 51, Paine 1) A good spot from John Starbuck \u2013 Stuart Broad has now joined Lord Fred as the leading wickettaker in Tests at Headingley. 34th over: Australia 139-5 (Labuschagne 50, Paine 0) Wade was even more unfortunate than I first thought. The ball hit his thigh pad, deflected onto his glove and then dribbled back onto the stumps. That\u2019s some dumb luck. \u201cBit early to declare the end of the Root era \u2013 it seems harsh to blame him,\u201d says Matt Jones. \u201cWhat is he supposed to about something like the 28th over? Stokes is mature enough to know what\u2019s required, and that simply isn\u2019t good enough. He can hardly claim fatigue\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t know, this is his third summer and there isn\u2019t much evidence that he\u2019s a natural captain. He certainly isn\u2019t flattered by the comparison with Eoin Morgan. As usual, though, it\u2019ll depend on the Ashes \u2013 if they come back to win or even draw this series, he\u2019ll surely keep going. I just feel like the team is going nowhere. A short ball from Archer follows Labuschagne and hits him on the glove, prompting the umpires to check the light meter. It\u2019s okay for now. A quick single later in the over takes Labuschagne to another high-class fifty, this one from 73 balls. Come back Steve, all is forgiven. Hang on, Wade has been bowled in bizarre circumstances! He was hit on the thigh pad by Archer, and the ball dribbled miserably onto the leg stump. That is so unlucky. 33rd over: Australia 138-4 (Labuschagne 49, Wade 0) Broad and Archer have combined figures of 21-5-59-4. Woakes and Stokes have combined figures of 12-1-73-0. This is so much better from England. Broad has bowled Travis Head with a stunning delivery, a full-length legcutter that slammed into the top of off stump. It was unplayable - so good, in fact, that Broad pulled a Broadface in response to his own brilliance rather than that of a teammate. Gone for all money! 32nd over: Australia 137-3 (Labuschagne 48, Head 0) Imagine how good Jofra Archer will be at the age of 28. It\u2019s not the wicket so much as the timing and the manner of it; England were in all kinds of trouble, so he turned things up and sorted Warner out with the minimum of fuss. He almost makes it two in the over when Head plays and misses at another beautiful delivery. Archer is now bowling faster than at any stage today. Archer may have been overbowled but he is still producing jaffas galore. The ball after beating Warner with a spectacular legcutter, he had him caught behind off a superb fuller delivery that seamed away just enough to take the edge. Glorious bowling. Oh man, this kid is sensational. \u201cThis is highly frustrating,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cAre \u2018the guys\u2019 just relying on conditions to do the work for them only to find a partial or complete concerted refusal to work, or retardation or obstruction of work, by persons who are or have been employed by the same employer or by different employers, for the purpose of remedying a grievance or resolving a dispute in respect of any matter of mutual interest between employer and employee in accordance with the Labour Relations Act, No 66 of 1995?\u201d It\u2019s a bit more complicated than that. 31st over: Australia 133-2 (Warner 61, Labuschagne 45) That was an excellent, intense over from Broad. Time for drinks. Warner is not out! It was a superb delivery from Broad, full of length and seaming away from Warner, but he reviewed it straight away and there was nothing on Ultra-Edge. David Warner is given out caught behind off Broad - but he has reviewed it. 30th over: Australia 131-2 (Warner 59, Labuschagne 45) Root turns to Archer; of course he does. Archer\u2019s pace has been down in the mid-80s today \u2013 we don\u2019t know for sure whether that\u2019s due to fatigue or because he wants to bowl a fuller length in these conditions. A short ball is slapped up and over for a couple by Warner, who is starting to dominate in familiar style, and Labuschagne cuts emphatically for four later in the over. Even Archer is leaking runs now. I\u2019m sorry to say that England have had an absolute shocker since tea. I\u2019m probably overreacting - I do have a bit of a humour on right now - but these are starting to feel like end times for the Root era. 29th over: Australia 124-2 (Warner 57, Labuschagne 41) \u2018I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing better body language from the England players,\u2019 says Shane Warne. This is the time they need to bring a fresh Archer into the attack to make something happen, but they\u2019ve already overbowled him. Woakes strays onto the pads of Labuschagne, who does the necessary to pick up his seventh four. Woakes has figures of 7-1-43-0, and though eight of those came from overthrows, there has been too much loose stuff. \u201cRoot having his Nasser moment with the toss today?\u201d says Kevin Wilson. \u201cWarner played and missed so much he was nailed on for a ton.\u201d I thought it was close to a 50/50 call \u2013 they just haven\u2019t bowled well. 28th over: Australia 120-2 (Warner 57, Labuschagne 37) A disgusting delivery from Stokes is slapped through point for four by Warner. That takes him to 49, and later in the over he pings a slower ball just over point for four more to reach his fifty. It\u2019s been a seriously hard-fought innings, one that will give him so much satisfaction after his desperate start to the series. Runs are flowing at Headingley. Stokes ends the over with a swinging full toss that is steered for the third boundary of the over. He needs to be replaced, probably by Stuart Broad. There have been 73 runs in the last 11 overs! 27th over: Australia 108-2 (Warner 45, Labuschagne 37) For the second time in half an hour, one becomes five for David Warner when he takes a quick single and the throw flies to the boundary. On this occasion there was no deflection off the bat; it was a loose throw from square leg. Labuschagne adds four more with a superb flick through square leg. The last 10 overs have cost 61 runs, which in such bowler-friendly conditions is a minor scandal. England look grumpy, ragged and in urgent need of a wicket. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that this session could cost them the Ashes. 26th over: Australia 97-2 (Warner 40, Labuschagne 31) A short ball from Woakes is pulled confidently behind square for four by Labuschagne. He looks a very accomplished player, although Glamorgan fans have known this for a while. He also leaves the ball a bit like Steve Smith, with a lightsaber swish after the ball has passed the bat. 25th over: Australia 93-2 (Warner 40, Labuschagne 27) Woakes is about to launch into an LBW appeal when Labuschagne gets a very late inside edge. Warner survives a biggish shout for LBW later in the over, and Woakes discourages Root from reviewing on the grounds that it might have been high. It was a lovely delivery, though, and Woakes is starting to look more dangerous. 24th over: Australia 92-2 (Warner 40, Labuschagne 26) A thick edge from Labuschagne flies wide of third slip for four. England are bowling some good balls - Woakes beat Warner twice in the previous over - but they are also haemorrhaging runs. One of these years I\u2019ll remember how to spell haemorrhaging and won\u2019t need to check. \u201cI can\u2019t shake the feeling that if Jimmy Anderson had been able to bowl in these conditions, Australia wouldn\u2019t be 70-2 after 19 overs,\u201d says Christopher Davis. \u201cA fair few plays and misses but also plenty of bad balls.\u201d Agreed. England haven\u2019t bowled well enough so far, and that\u2019s a big problem when your pace attack is your strength. 23rd over: Australia 87-2 (Warner 40, Labuschagne 21) Warner steals a quick single off Woakes - and he gets five when Denly\u2019s throw deflects off the bat of Warner. He puts his hand up to apologise; it wasn\u2019t his fault. These two have been superb between the wickets; in fact, they have scored 40 from the last six overs. These are worrying times for England. Might even be end times for Joe Root. If England lose here, that\u2019s it, the Ashes have gone. 22nd over: Australia 79-2 (Warner 33, Labuschagne 20) Labuschagne is hit on the side, offering no stroke to a length delivery from Stokes. That was an odd leave, although there was no risk of getting out. Warner then laces a drive to the right of mid-off, where Woakes saves three runs with a fine diving stop. Warner is starting to look like himself for the first time in the series, while Labuschagne is batting with authority at the other end. If Australia bat well in the next 24 hours, they could put England under intolerable pressure. 21st over: Australia 75-2 (Warner 32, Labuschagne 17) The ball is still swinging, and Woakes restores a bit of order with a tidy maiden to Warner. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting from Tom Carver and salutary that it\u2019s post-2005 fastest balls. I\u2019ve always had it in mind that Simon Jones was \u2018properly fast\u2019, but guess that the post-2005 cut off for that stat rules him out,\u201d says Ben Powell. \u201cWhich set me wondering: how fast was Jones? Is my memory playing tricks on me, or was he really properly fast? I\u2019d be grateful for any stats on his fastest spells.\u201d I don\u2019t think he was as fast as Brett Lee or Shoaib Akhtar, but he hit 90mph more than anyone else in that England attack. That\u2019s how I remember it, anyway. I have no hard data to offer you. 20th over: Australia 75-2 (Warner 32, Labuschagne 17) Stokes strays onto the pads of Labuschagne, who tucks him to the fine-leg boundary to bring up a fine fifty partnership. Australia are scoring freely at the moment. BREAKING NEWS: JOFRA ARCHER HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE ATTACK Ben Stokes is going to replace him. 19th over: Australia 70-2 (Warner 31, Labuschagne 13) Woakes\u2019 first ball is edged for four by Warner. It went at catchable height through the vacant fourth-slip area. Later in the over he bowls a delivery to Labuschagne which swings so violently that it goes between first and second slip for four byes. The next ball is perfect, a classic outswinger that beats Labuschagne\u2019s defensive prod, and an eventful over concludes with an excellent drive through mid-off for four. England are in a bit of bother here. I suspect Joe Root is starting to wish he had batted first. \u201cArcher won\u2019t be RFF for much longer if Root has anything to do with it,\u201d says Phil Harrison. \u201cHe\u2019s like a kid on Xmas morning with an amazing new toy. He plays with it and plays with it and plays with it. And then it breaks.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what \u2018sorting Kohli out emphatically\u2019 means,\u201d says Digivjay Yadav. \u201cHe bowled a good bumper, then a slow one, and then a delivery which should have been smacked for six but he tried to be too clever with and guided it to gully. Hardly bounced out.\u201d Well, that\u2019s your opinion. The people who emailed in before had a different opinion. And lo, life went on. Play is about to resume. That\u2019s nice. Play can go on until 7.30pm, weather permitting. \u201cI think Mac Millings has called Derek Thunderwood wrong,\u201d says Jon Lever, \u201cas that just sounds like a Cornish porn star. Derek Underflood, surely.\u201d \u201cFinn was faster than you remember,\u201d says Tom Carver. \u201cSky (or someone \u2013 Sky showed it on TV) produced a list of fastest spells by Englishmen since 2005. Flintoff faster than I remember. Everyone always said he bowled a heavy ball, rather than being particularly fast. 1. Andrew Flintoff \u2013 91.5mph vs Australia, 2009 (Edgbaston) 2. Steve Harmison \u2013 90.7mph vs Australia, 2006 (Adelaide) 3. Steven Finn \u2013 90.6mph vs New Zealand, 2013 (Dunedin).\u201d That was my point \u2013 Finn at his best hovered around 88, with the ability to go up to around 92 when his rhythm was perfect. Of course that\u2019s fast, but there is a level above that (Lee, Akhtar, Spencer, Patterson, van Troost, Johnson, Archer, etc.) Maybe we need four classifications for right-arm seam bowlers: RM, RFM, RF and RFF. This, as usual, is a great spot from Tim. Archer should be a shock bowler, not a stock bowler. I also wonder about the effect it has had on the confidence of others, Woakes in particular. \u201cDo you think that, with all this rain and bad light, Australia might win the Ashes 1-0?\u201d says Malcolm Brown. \u201c(Weather is nicer here in Tuscany by the way, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s room for some cricket.) Ciao.\u201d I suspect we\u2019ll get at least four days in one of the Tests, and that should be enough with these batting line-ups. It\u2019s not beyond the realms, though, especially as this is the first Ashes series to include two Tests in September (I think). The umpires have brought the tea break forward, which is sensible in the circumstances. Sky have switched to coverage from Antigua. India are 44 for three, with KL Rahul on 22 and Ajinkya Rahane on 1. Virat Kohli was dismissed for 9 by Shannon Gabriel - and, according to a couple of your emails, Gabriel sorted him out emphatically. \u201cIt bothered me far too much that Mac Millings\u2019 rain delay team didn\u2019t have a keeper,\u201d says Tim Wood. \u201cI\u2019ve spent 20 minutes trying to think of rain-related plays on Wasim Bari or wondering if we could partner Jack Russell with Phil Tufnell for when its raining cats and dogs. Then it came in a flash: Craig Kies-wetter. We can all get back to work now.\u201d \u201cThe last time I saw Steven Finn, he looked like a bowler impersonating Steven Finn,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cNothing was quite right - everything a little bit off. It was a reminder - as if we needed one - of what a strange and beautiful thing is fast bowling. As Mfuneko Ngam and Andre van Troost (amongst others, Frank Tyson anyone?) can attest, we should enjoy them while we can, for their bloom is often fleeting.\u201d Indeed. Although Finn was never fast, was he? I think of him at around 88mph, occasionally up to 92mph, rather than 95mph+ like van Troost and Tyson. Bad light stops play The crowd boo the decision, and the England players aren\u2019t happy either. Joe Root was told he could bowl the spinners if he wanted to stay on. 18th over: Australia 54-2 (Warner 26, Labuschagne 7) Archer continues; of course he does. He\u2019s bowled a third of England\u2019s overs since the start of the Lord\u2019s Test, which is bordering on a health-and-safety issue. Warner tucks him off the pads for three, then Labuschagne does likewise for four. Australia have played with impressive authority since the resumption. \u201cThese rain delays are proving to be remorselessly helpful in terms of my productivity,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI\u2019d intended to hang my metamorphic Closed sign on the door from 11am and master the fine art of doing sweet eff all other than watching the cricket. But no, we have to have rain delays. Thus I\u2019ve been writing 250 words here, three or four emails there. I curse this English weather for my employers and clients may come to expect this sort of responsiveness in the future.\u201d 17th over: Australia 47-2 (Warner 23, Labuschagne 3) Chris Woakes replaces Stuart Broad. He should - should - bowl very well in those conditions. His first over is a bit of a range-finder, from which Australia grab three singles. Warner is starting to look busy between the wickets, which is usually a good sign for Australia. 16th over: Australia 44-2 (Warner 21, Labuschagne 2) Archer has five slips for David Warner, who drives a half-volley through mid-off for three. Archer has bowled more like an English seamer today, hitting a full length at around 85mph. I suppose he has to assume that role in the absence of James Anderson and Chris W-oh. Archer reminds everyone of his menace with a sharp bouncer that is nicely avoided by Labuschagne. There\u2019s no pace in this pitch. \u201cWhilst we are on the memory lane thing, I was at the England v SA 2003 match (as was Jimmy Anderson \u2013 he got two wickets in the match),\u201d says Simon Thomas. \u201cMy wife called me to tell me the news that she was pregnant with our first child and I got so emotionally happy drunk that I was eventually turned away from a nightclub I wasn\u2019t even trying to get into. The bouncer actually crossed the road to tell me \u2018never, ever, are you coming in here\u2019. Happy days.\u201d 15th over: Australia 41-2 (Warner 18, Labuschagne 2) Broad bowls the last ball of his eighth over, which he started before the rain break, and Labuschagne scrunches it through the covers for a couple to get off the mark. \u201cThe Wedding Present!\u201d pants Martin Sinclair. \u201cBlimey, this takes me back. I got into them in the sixth form and first saw them at the Reading Festival in 1989, when I was a tender lad of 16 years. Haven\u2019t listened to them in ages until today and am now trawling their back catalogue, so even though there has been precious little cricket, it\u2019s been a great morning just because of them. All together now \u2013 \u2018ah-ah-oh!!\u2019\u201d I thought that was Two Door Cinema Club. Play is about to resume, and I have just one request for Joe Root: FOR THE LOVE OF SWING, GIVE CHRIS WOAKES A BLOODY BOWL. World Test Championship department Things are happening in Antigua. Things. India are 25-3 on the first morning of the series against West Indies, whose demolition of England may have been more than a glorious one-off. \u201cPedantry corner,\u201d begins Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cPrecipitate\u2019 just means something happening prematurely. Millings must be thinking of \u2018Precipi\u2019 Tait-ion.\u201d \u201cI enjoyed the two emails regarding Finn,\u201d says Tom Van der Gucht. \u201cReading about how Archer bowled some of England\u2019s fastest ever overs lately, I noticed that Finn\u2019s name kept on popping up as England\u2019s last pace ace, so what actually happened? What led to him becoming unselectable during the tour of hell? He seems to have fizzled out of favour ever since. For the last few seasons, I forlornly check Middlesex\u2019s score cards and county averages, in the hope to see him surging back to form, only to see he rarely gets picked. I\u2019d love for somebody like Gideon Haigh or Simon Wilde to write a book really going into the full details. Was it confidence? Form? Injury? Giles? Saker? Flower? Cook? Morgan?\u201d I don\u2019t know him, but I\u2019m fairly sure the biggest factor, by some distance, was confidence. A few other things certainly didn\u2019t help, like the Graeme Smith no-ball and being dropped in his first two Ashes series. The thing that confuses me about Finn is that he had a glorious comeback in 2015, and it seemed like he\u2019d conquered all the demons. I\u2019m not sure he ever bowled better for England than during the Boxing Day Test in Durban. But the following summer he struggled again, and he played what will almost certainly be his last Test at the age of 27. He\u2019s pretty candid in the film The Edge (which is great, btw). Play will restart at 3.40pm Woot. Woot. Thanks Adam, hello everyone. This is all a little irksome, but at least it means I don\u2019t have to do any work we can talk nonsense for an hour or so. Right on cue, here\u2019s Mac Millings: \u201cAdam chose not to publish this, but you, sir, are the kind of man prepared to sink to depths few others even know exist. So here it is, the all time Rain Delay XI: Cyril Washout Colin Cloudrey Splashin\u2019 Tendulkar David Shower Drizzle Br\u2019ollyveira Ian Rainbowtham Derek Thunderwood Harbhajan Singhin\u2019 in the... ...Rain Delaymond Illingworth Shaun \u201cPrecipi\u201d Tait Look outside, it\u2019s P.Siddling down\u201d \u201cI remember well a protracted spell of insomnia during the 06/07 Ashes,\u201d writes David Alcock. \u201cI think I followed every night (day?) of that series while writing interminable reports on medieval sculpture conservation. The grim yet bizarrely satisfying reading of the OBO kept me from being a complete gibbering wreck. Perverse, I know, but that strange perversion that is \u2018proper\u2019 English cricket... ie, losing. Keep it up.\u201d Thank you. We will. They\u2019re more Smyth areas - thankfully, he\u2019s here to take over from me in a jiffy. One last Cud email before I go. \u201cNever imagined I would put these two favourite things together in one heading OBO and CUD,\u201d says a very happy Tim Cooper. \u201cJust came back to my screen to see a thread on the greatest Leeds band that almost but never quite made it big, within coverage of cricket at Headingley. I\u2019m in total heaven. My pledge for the most appropriately themed hit \u2013 Punishment-Reward Relationship.\u201d Thanks for being part of it. Given all this passion for Cud over the last few hours, I\u2019m off to listen to them over a cup of tea. Thanks for your brilliant company as always. Over to Rob. Bye for now! \u201cYou say the Aussie batsmen will be happy to get off the field due to the rain,\u201d says Chris Parker, \u201cbut it is giving Broad and Archer nice rests between spells. Could see these two bowl the first 30-35 overs between them.\u201d Scyld Berry was making this very point to me last night about Gooch\u2019s epic here in 1991 - it included several breaks for rain. A few more emails before Rob takes over. \u201cWatching in Malaysia and wondering if a hard day at work tomorrow is worth a sleepless night,\u201d asks Joel Eley. You already know my view on this, I am sure. Stay up, stick it out. \u201cThe ball is hooping nicely and even though Lyon in the 4th innings could be tough these are ideal seem bowling conditions, right up Broad\u2019s street. Imagine if Jimmy was available.\u201d Estsban Coniogordo has a thought - I suspect he\u2019s following in Australia. \u201cI am calling for everyone to do a rain dance. I am thinking of Purple Rain. We can win the weather. Play a song.\u201d Yep, proper rain now. Another mini-session, another wicket. Broad, who has dominated Warner, picked up Khawaja down the legside instead. But, much as it was during the earlier rain delay, the opener is still alive and that\u2019s all that really matters. Big covers on. Or does it? The England fielders are stopping on the boundary line, arguing that the rain isn\u2019t falling. The umpires, Wilson and Gaffaney, are already off the ground. The Headingley crowd aren\u2019t thrilled either. Nup, they are off. The consensus on TMS is that it might be light rain now but the heavy stuff is on the way soon. Urrrrgh. 14.5 overs: Australia 39-2 (Warner 18, Labuschagne 0) It is a productive over for Australia with Warner crunching Broad behind point for four then grabbing a couple out to the covers... but then the rain arrives. Again. I\u2019m sorry. 14th over: Australia 32-2 (Warner 11, Labuschagne 0) Three maidens on the bounce, Archer right on top of Labuschagne this time around. The short ball, which we haven\u2019t seen much of so far, is just avoided to begin. As the over moves on, twice he\u2019s beaten on the outside edge. How often have I typed those words in these 14 overs? \u201cMaybe they should be using a Kookaburra,\u201d says Jim Maxwell on TMS. \u201cThese Dukes balls are doing too much to get the edge!\u201d 13th over: Australia 32-2 (Warner 11, Labuschagne 0) They can go through until 7:30pm to get the overs in, I am told. They will need that if Broad keeps beating Warner, the former slowly making his way back to the top of his mark after once again sorting him out outside the off stump to start this new over. Another lovely delivery. But the opener is able to leave four of the five balls that follow. Maybe Woakes from his end? Either way, time to give him a burst. 12th over: Australia 32-2 (Warner 11, Labuschagne 0) Ooh, Labuschagne has a pop at a ball well outside the off stump. It\u2019s full enough, but the movement is sufficient to beat him. Alastair Cook is with me on the Queenslander copying the Steve Smith leave. Woakes now up the hill for a bit, yeah? \u201cBefore we get too deep into the session, I\u2019d just like to quickly second Avitaj Mitra\u2019s praise of the OBO,\u201d says Matt Dony. Okay, I\u2019ll allow it! \u201cOBO\u2019s/MBM\u2019s etc. have become a sort of \u2018watching in the pub with my mates\u2019 that, particularly during Test Matches and the World Cup, I can enjoy at work. (Or, as I currently am, on holiday.) Also, throwing all the way back, nice to see the effort you\u2019re putting into following the AFL final. Sure beats will.i.am absently checking his phone while performing last year.\u201d Thank you. It\u2019s an institution. Both the OBO and dodgy Grand Final entertainment. Google Meatloaf for verification of the latter point. 11th over: Australia 32-2 (Warner 11, Labuschagne 0) Warner now into double figures on the board having already gone beyond ten plays and misses. But he\u2019s still there. I\u2019ve seen this one before: he\u2019ll be 100-plus at the close. He reaches that first mark with a clip for two, able to deal with this Broad over without any serious concern. \u201cAll these young whippersnapper bands!\u201d says Andrew Tyacke. \u201cI remember Leeds University Union hops in the mid 60\u2019s through to 1972: The Who, Pink Floyd, The Animals, Alan Price Set, Acker Bilk, Chris Barber, Nadia Catouse and the incomparable BBC Northern Dance Orchestra who could play any style, en masse or in various groups. There seemed to be a brilliant group every other week!\u201d Oliver Thorpe has also enjoyed today\u2019s OBO theme: \u201cLoving your work and the mentions of The Wedding Present (seen \u2018em about 30 times) and the Original Oak - Otley run (uni days in the 90s). Cud indeed used to live down the road from Headingley as we took on the flat after they left. I had Carl\u2019s old room \u2013 I found some postcards his mum sent to him.\u201d 10th over: Australia 30-2 (Warner 9, Labuschagne 0) Archer\u2019s turn to work Warner over, beating him with the first ball of this new over - again on the drive. Deary me, this really is something - 11 plays and misses in 27 balls, according to Andrew Samson on TMS. Root moves a fifth slip into the cordon, Warner responding with a compact drive - that\u2019s better; four runs from the overpitched offering. Archer gets one go at Labuschagne later in the over and he gives it a mini-lightsaber leave in response. They\u2019re certainly in fashion. He is! Technology confirms an edge as the ball passes Khawaja\u2019s bat. Broad finally picks up a wicket, from his worst delivery so far. IS KHAWAJA CAUGHT DOWN THE LEGSIDE? Bairstow is insistent! Root goes upstairs. Stand by! 8th over: Australia 21-1 (Warner 5, Khawaja 4) Archer beats Khawaja glorious bit of bowling. Broad and Archer will be criticised here, I am sure, for not bowling quite straight enough. But these are balls starting on middle and off - they are just moving it too much. Khawaja does well to grab a single when it is there to be taken behind square. Warner hasn\u2019t seen much of Archer yet but he is beaten with the one delivery he has to see off here, attempting to drive. \u201cThat\u2019s his first really bad shot,\u201d notes Vaughan on TMS. 7th over: Australia 20-1 (Warner 5, Khawaja 3) Broad vs Warner: they go again. He finds a leading edge to begin, but into the turf. Oh, and he\u2019s done again prodding at a ball that he should have left alone. Nerves. But getting one that\u2019s a touch straighter the opener doesn\u2019t miss out, carefully clipping past the square leg umpire for his first four. Sure enough, Broad is right back on it, Warner this time leaving close to the off-stump. And he is up for lbw to finish! It looks to be angling down leg and is given not out. No review. Good decision, watching the replay back that was drifting down. Superb cricket. \u201cJust when I thought the OBO couldn\u2019t get any better, the Rochy gets a shout out!\u201d says Tom Tavener. \u201c(Miss)spent a good portion of my uni days on that sticky dance floor. If you\u2019re in need of some rain-delay listening, the Black Night Crash playlist is still live on Spotify.\u201d We probably know each other. I DJ\u2019d there a few times. Ahhh. 6th over: Australia 16-1 (Warner 1, Khawaja 3) Oh, and now Khawaja has to handle Archer, who sorted him out so comprehensively on Sunday afternoon at Lord\u2019s. Good batting here, defending with soft hands to both sides of the wicket, picking up a couple into the covers, then getting his blade out of the way when the length allows. All at managable pace this time around, in the low/mid 80s. 5th over: Australia 14-1 (Warner 1, Khawaja 1) Broad beats Warner first ball! Of course he does! It\u2019s a beauty. Somehow, he gets off strike from the next, with one to square leg. Khawaja\u2019s turn... and he cops a pearler first up as well! UNPLAYABLE! \u201cHe\u2019s getting the ball doing too much,\u201d says Michael Vaughan. FIVE SLIPS now. The number three does well to get on the front foot to push a single to get off the mark. Warner watches the last couple. Better. Blimey. Middle session: 1400 - 1640, final session: 1700 - 1900. 72 overs left to play today. Get in! It is Broad vs Warner again. PLAY! One last bit on Cud. \u201cA couple of members of Cud used to live in that row of big Victorian terraced houses on the way from the ground back into Headingley,\u201d says Bertie Wooster. \u201cI remember them complaining about people pissing in their garden during Test matches. Not huge cricket fans.\u201d Neil MacKenzie is in Adelaide, but was once in this part of the world. \u201cI was a student in Leeds in the mid 80s living just over the boundary on cardigan rd. Used to frequent the \u2018phono\u2019 a club in the bowels of the merrian centre. Is it still there?\u201d And one from Phil in Area 51: \u201cAny self respecting Leeds centric cricketmusic blog needs a shout out to Delta5.\u201d Consider them shouted. \u201cMy girlfriend is expecting our first child in November,\u201d says Damian Burns. Well done! \u201cAnd after that super over I looked into her eyes and said that I honestly wouldn\u2019t mind if Ben or Jofra turned out to be the father. While the euphoric hallucinations have now passed, I stand by that statement.\u201d I mentioned my girlfiend\u2019s affection for Jofra earlier. We\u2019re expecting our first in February and I suspect she shares your view. \u201cCan\u2019t vouch for this,\u201d says Thomas Langford, \u201cbut definitely remember being told that the 2005 ashes started at 10.30 so that channel 4 could still show the Simpsons at six.\u201d That\u2019s why we have the earlier start in Australia: for the 6pm news. Dan Collins has a more logical answer: \u201cI believe that the early start issue was a problem because many people like to arrive at grounds by train, and trains arriving early enough in say Brum to get you to Edgbaston by 10.15am (which is still cutting it fine for a 10.30 start, with the crowds coming in) tend to have started out in their originating stations within peak times ie when tickets are (a lot) more expensive.\u201d \u201cIn response to David Murray worrying we won\u2019t see Mark Wood again,\u201d emails Fraser Padmore, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to an Archer/Wood/Stone trident force-feeding the Aussies their own medicine on the proverbial \u201cfast bouncy one\u201d at the WACA.\u201d You\u2019re half right. The WACA won\u2019t be in use anymore for an Ashes Test (for shame), but the replacement ground over the river was rather sporting last year, especially later in the Test Match. \u201cI don\u2019t think enough credit is being given,\u201d begins Richard Atenbury, \u201cto the people who found Jofra Archer and who got him to come to England. Also to whoever got the rules governing the game changed so that he could qualify for England quicker and in time for the World Cup and the Ashes. I assume this will repeated and that we can get other young superstars into the England team, not just from the Caribbean but from all the other cricket playing nations of the world.\u201d Vaguely related: I liked this from Dave Tickner. \u201cWhat difference does a fairly small change in the angle the ball is coming from make?\u201d asks Jonathan Brookes about bowling close to the wicket. \u201cShouldn\u2019t the batsman just adjust his positioning slightly depending on the bowler to get himself in a position with relation to the line between the bowler\u2019s release point and his wicket that he favours?\u201d Above the shoulders, innit? How I\u2019ve always felt. \u201cAlso a big shout out for the mighty Pale Saints,\u201d suggests Simon Thomas. \u201cProto-shoegazers in all their glory.\u201d In terms of my request for dancing to guitars, John Starbuck has found me a flamenco studio. Not quite, but nearly. Let\u2019s not rule it out. \u201cTalking of Gang Of Four,\u201d on that same topic from Ian Forth. \u201cI always hoped KP would choose \u2018At Home He\u2019s A Tourist\u2019 to walk out to in T20s. Meanwhile, in the present, the stadium DJ might dig out \u2018Damaged Goods\u2019 for the announcement of the Aussie XI.\u201d When I grow up, I will be the Cricket Ground DJ. \u201cTomorrow is my birthday and I am going as Wonder Woman,\u201d Chris Mellor advises. \u201cPlease keep an eye out for me and give me a mention/wave if you spot me.\u201d I\u2019ll have my long lens out ready to pap/include you. Do it well. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Hi Avitaj Mitra. \u201cJust wanted to let you (and other OBO members) know how much I have come to enjoy the entire OBO.. thing.. I guess. It\u2019s just something that grows on you, you know.. and on days when there\u2019s no cricket (and consequently no OBO), there\u2019s just a slightly empty feeling in your heart. And of course, enjoying the OBO has nothing to do with cricket, because I have learned about bands, cuisine, dance moves, puns.. the OBO has it all. Long story short, I love it. Here\u2019s to a brilliant 5 days of sport.\u201d Well, that\u2019s lovely. Thank you. And I understand: before I moved into this cricket writing caper, I had a real thing for reading the OBO. A lurker of sorts, I never emailed in. It\u2019s a great joy steering the ship. \u201cGreat to see the Wedding Present mentioned,\u201d says Peter Salmon. \u201cI saw them last month in Worcestershire doing a 30th anniversary tour of the album Bizarro. Took my missus who was busy being trained as a concert violinist in their heyday and so had never been to ANY rock gig EVER. She loved it \u2013 straight into the Mosh Pit the moment Brassneck started. So can I do us all a favour and make my OBO Love Song Dedication the song \u2018Kennedy\u2019, from 1989\u2019s aforementioned Bizarro by the Wedding Present?\u201d This is the second time I\u2019ve popped this in today. No regrets. \u201cThe sun is just coming up in northern Michigan,\u201d notes Mick Collins. \u201cI also have fond memories of the Original Oak when studying in Leeds back in the 1990s. Of course, at that time, the Oak had a bowling green which made for a very comfortable mid-beerfest resting place.\u201d Only one cover is left on - the one in the middle. We can\u2019t be far away from getting official word of some re-start times. \u201cI\u2019d always been told that starting before 11 in England wasn\u2019t advised because of the issues with dampness and dew on the ground,\u201d says Ben Powell. \u201cThat said, the World Cup matches started, for the most part, at 10.30 so there may well be some latitude for looking at this.\u201d I asked around about this recently. Some of my colleagues, who have been around a while, remember when Tests could/did start at 10:30am when weather had intervened earlier in a match. They seemed to think the change happened around the 2005 Ashes? I also have some advice from Simon Bellamy. \u201cAs one who also likes to dance to guitars,\u201d (not related to Matt, are you?), \u201cI was going to suggest that you head to the Cockpit in Leeds, cos there was bound to be something on that would tickle your fancy. I\u2019m horrified to learn that it closed down five years ago. It was a fantastic venue, one every touring band played at at some point as they were coming up (or going down). I\u2019m unaccountably upset, first because the Cockpit is no longer there, and second because everything I\u2019ve just said makes me feel very, very old.\u201d Oh dear. I know how this feels. I was punter quoted in the story when The Rochy hit the wall in Melbourne a few years back. \u201cThe Rochy has evolved into a bit of an indie music institution, a special place that went out of its way to make all types of people feel welcome and happy,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIt is the sort of place where if you spilled a drink on someone you\u2019re more likely to get a new one bought for you than cop a punch in the nose.\u201d We are being gaslit by the Leeds weather. \u201cThis is my first email into the Guardian, and to you, so it\u2019s lovely to virtually meet you.\u201d And you, Nathan Goldsmith. Let\u2019s make it the first of many. \u201cIt is a great shame the weather isn\u2019t as lovely as we are experiencing in Southampton right now, and a greater shame that Southampton won\u2019t see another game of cricket played by England in it for the next few years. On the off chance you might know, when can we expect to see an England return to Southampton?\u201d I know they are very disappointed at the Rose Bowl not to have an Ashes Test this time or next, in 2023. They did very well out of the World Cup - I think they are still playing group games down there. \u201cThis features Jimmy Anderson as a musician,\u201d says John Starbuck. Okay, let\u2019s give it a go. Sticking with music, Matthew Dony: \u201cAs far as footballers-as-record-covers goes; The Wedding Present had a good stab. But it wasn\u2019t a patch on the Super Furry Animals\u2019 appropriation of Robin Friday.\u201d I wish to one day write a song about Lance \u2018Buddy\u2019 Franklin, who plays his 300th AFL game this weekend. Do yourself a favour. Worse than at any stage this morning. Settle in. All the covers are still on, in case you were wondering. \u201cDear Adam.\u201d Hello Jason Ali. \u201cDuring the last Test I raised the possibility that we were effectively witnessing the cricketing funeral of Jimmy Anderson. I stand by that call. In the last week or so, things have moved on so rapidly it is almost impossible to imagine him being recalled: the King is dead, long live the King. I\u2019d be delighted to hear of the counter arguments.\u201d I\u2019d be shocked if Jimmy doesn\u2019t play at Old Trafford. Imagine if England get this done. We move to Manchester with Smith and Anderson returning. I\u2019ll have all of that. To your broader point, I never really expected him to go beyond this Ashes - right? On the other hand, I\u2019d love to see him in Australia once last time. Back in ten. I\u2019m going to grab a plate of food while there is one to be had. \u201cThis is somewhat tangential to the earlier appropriate band/album suggestions,\u201d Geoff Wignall begins - perfect for the OBO, then. \u201cBut apparently during the 1950s and \u201860s Leeds had a thriving jazz and folk scene and some blues but virtually no rock bands. According to guitar virtuoso Michael Chapman, this had a simple cause: the local police wouldn\u2019t permit Tetley\u2019s and rock\u2019n\u2019roll to coexist in the same building. I suspect the prohibition was broader than just Tetley\u2019s but that\u2019s just a detail.\u201d I\u2019m really looking forward to a frolic this weekend. In addition to Mojo, can anyone recommend a place for me to dance to guitars? \u201cWith all the talk about Archer, a thought for poor Mark Wood,\u201d says David Murray. \u201cAfter everyone was so excited he had recovered from his problems to be bowling super fast again he now seems to be well out of the picture.\u201d I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever be far away from calculations? Remember, Scyld Berry said his spell at St Lucia in February this year was the fastest he has seen for England and he\u2019s covered 400-plus Tests. More on Steve Finn, forever a close-to-the-stumps operator. \u201cAs he was mentioned in passing a short while ago,\u201d writes Jean Slater. \u201cI was wondering if his time in an England shirt has gone? With Woods and Stone out for the series, would he be in contention if there were a couple of injuries in the existing seam department?\u201d I suspect not? BUT, how about his Middlesex teammate Toby Roland-Jones? Another big bag for the hyphen this week, I note. I hope that Finn gets back, of course. Would make a great story. Scott Robert on him too. \u201cTom Carver makes a very good point about Steven Finn\u2019s issues with bowling from close to the stumps, but I believe that good old David Saker was incredibly culpable in destroying Finn\u2019s action, as he has tried to do with Stokes\u2019s. You watch Stokes\u2019s action when he first started playing, and even though he had the mad, curved run-up, he arrived at the crease very close to the stumps and rotated beautifully around his sideways on action, swinging the ball away from the right handers. If you watch him now, he doesn\u2019t get as close to the stumps, and his arm goes beyond the perpendicular, meaning he closes his upper body off and can only angle the ball into the right hander. He\u2019s lost his away swing. You could see exactly the same thing started happening with Finn. If you\u2019re as sad as me, you can see the metamorphosis of both of their actions via the youtubes.\u201d There\u2019s a lot going on here. I\u2019ll jump on the \u2018tube and take a look. Back to the inbox, yeah? Before going to that, I\u2019ll quickly note that the new grandstand looks magnificent. I loved the old view to the football stand, but they\u2019ve done a great job. It\u2019s not too big. Nice. A lot of OBO love for Cud. Nick Witteveen recommends Red Lorry Yellow Lorry, Cameron Derrick linking me to One Giant Love. He also wants to bring Gang of Four to my attention. \u201cAlso a potential nickname for a bowling attack?\u201d \u201cShould we wait until after the end of the fifth test for Jofra to sort Brexit out, or can he do it between Tests?\u201d asks Andrew in E7. Did everyone follow his tweets about the HDMI cable the other night? My girlfiend met Jofra I interviewed him in Cape Town last year. She doesn\u2019t pay much attention to cricket but she always asks after him. From the Jofradamous Archives: So, four completed overs. Broad has beaten Warner\u2019s blade five times by my count, but he\u2019s still there. Earlier in the successful Archer set he found Harris\u2019 edge, which ran through the cordon. Alastair Cook on TMS is explaining batting in a mini-session like that when rain is on the way and the ball is doing plenty. \u201cThere is very little you can do other than try and survive.\u201d Warner did, I guess. He is playing down the line and holding is shape. Small mercies. Archer has done it! Off stump, moving away delightfully. Harris edges through to Bairstow who makes no mistake. And they come off at the fall of the wicket for rain. Fantastic bowling. 4th over: Australia 12-1 (Warner 0) 3rd over: Australia 8-0 (Warner 0, Harris 4) Warner gets a similar ball on his hip to the delivery that finished the previous over, helping to the boundary off his thigh pad. Broad is right on the mark later in the over moving the ball a mile, just evading the edge and the off-stump. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect,\u201d says Alastair Cook on TMS. \u201cIf Warner was in better nick he would have nicked it.\u201d On that second point, Warner has a waft at the next ball with a horizontal bat - not pretty. Broad goes again with another borderline-unplayable, missing everything, but only just. He makes it four misses in a row with the final offering - this is ridiculous bowling! That was much fuller too. Broad runs away to cover with his hands on his hips, the bowler and batsman sharing a smile now that it\u2019s done. How is Warner still there? \u201cSurely a Test Match should be seen as 90 overs x 5 days rather than each day separate?\u201d writes Hugh Molloy. \u201cWhat I\u2019m getting at is that any overs missed today could be caught up with an early start/late finish tomorrow. Even a total washout day could be caught up. Extra session, 9:30am start, late finish, have full matches played. Just a thought.\u201d I find it odd that play won\u2019t start here before 11am. In Australia, we add half an hour to the start of days rather than at the end, when bad light is always a threat - especially this late in the northern season. 2nd over: Australia 4-0 (Warner 0, Harris 4) As Archer removes his jumper and cap there is a huge roar from the Leeds faithful. He\u2019s too wide to begin but finds his range with his third offering, darting away gorgeously off the seam. Perfect length. Oh, and he\u2019s done it again. Both are only in the mid-80s for pace; this is about skill. It is raining nearby we\u2019re told - can England get something from these generous conditions beforehand? Well handled by the newcomer Harris, who tickles the final delivery off the face of the bat for four. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Warner 0, Harris 0) The lights are on and here comes Broad from around the wicket, Warner prodding the first ball of the Test to cover. \u201cNO!\u201d comes the call, defending the next two to midwicket. With the fourth ball he BEATS HIM with a beauty! There are four slips in play for that very delivery. Moved a mile. Andrew Samson reports that Warner averages 32 when taking the first ball, 53 when not. Warner leaves the last couple. Time for Jofra. Let\u2019s do this! Stuart Broad will bowl down the hill from the Kirkstall Lane End, where he did so well last year against Pakistan. David Warner is taking the first ball, which is a touch unusual. Marcus Harris is there with him, on Ashes debut. PLAY! PLAY! PLAY! \u201cAlways a pleasure to tune in from sunny Spain,\u201d reports Laurent Baldoni. Great to have you with us. \u201cQuestion: what happens if you win a toss, choose to bowl, but it rains for, say, a whole day? You wanted to bowl on a grey, overcast day but then it\u2019s bright sunshine the next day and a good day for batting? Do you lump it?\u201d You do, indeed, lump it. It was interesting last week when Justin Langer told us how he explored the option of essentially giving the toss to England at Lord\u2019s. He was told that this isn\u2019t allowed. Do you want to see Geoff Lemon and me do our thing with Jim Maxwell before the Manchester Test? We\u2019re doing another live show. Jofra Archer is warming up in front of us... bowling spin, of course. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi Dave Hibell. \u201cAny truth to the rumour that the Australians have used drones to seed the clouds in an attempt to force the draw in Steve Smith\u2019s absence? Just to clarify, that\u2019s not a rumour I started, just one I heard.\u201d I think this might relate to our brilliant rain-OBO nonsense during the World Cup\u2019s wet week when several very smart people emailed in to explain how the best way to put a roof on a cricket ground is by having drones holding a tarp aloft. One day, my friends. One day. I\u2019m getting the usual bulk emails about the overseas TMS link. For future reference, when I\u2019m asked this, I go to google. Here \u2018tis! Lunch will be taken at 1:30pm. \u201cRe the \u2018bowling close to the wicket\u2019 brigade,\u201d begins Martin Gillam in Sydney. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget Mr. LBW, Terry Alderman -- test average of 21 against England.\u201d Indeed. He took nine wickets here in 1981 (before, you know) and ten in 1989. We\u2019re bouncing around a bit on JP\u2019s earlier topics, but I have to include this absolute gem from Rob Lonergan. \u201cAh 1992,\u201d he begins. \u201cIn a moment of serendipity I saw The Wedding Present at Cambridge Corn Exchange and Neil Mallender at Headingley for a double etched in my memory.\u201d Nothing but net. \u201cAh the Original Oak!\u201d adds Ian Copestake of JP\u2019s favourite Leeds drinking spot. \u201cResting point (or final resting place) of those on the famed Otley Run. Not the sort of run one gets sponsored for or boasts of on social media.\u201d Simon the Dentist is with us too, as the rope starts to make its way around the ground to clear some water before they think about moving the final cover off the playing strip. \u201cOn the subject of best bands from Leeds surely Cud must get a mention?\u201d he insists. \u201cStill going strong belting out the hits like I\u2019ve Had It With Blondes and Only A Prawn In Whitby.\u201d I\u2019m moving from TMS to Cud. Thanks. A few emails to get the blood pumping. \u201cDoes anyone know if Turkish Airlines have onboard WiFi?\u201d asks Emiel de Bont. \u201cAbout to board a flight for Istanbul, and the thought of having to miss 3 hours and 20 minutes of OBO coverage is kind of ruining my day.\u201d Usually, I enjoy the WiFi-free sanctuary of an international flight but it is right to make exceptions in these circumstances. Last year, I knew I would be flying when the AFL Grand Final was on so I made sure that I could jump on Norwegian Air because of their excellent WiFi. My poor girlfriend. And the poor person sitting next to me. Joe Skinner has jumped in on the Goths in Leeds theme: \u201cBit before my time \u2013 I was more rave era \u2013 but this is proper grainy.\u201d I went to a dive/rock bar called Mojo a couple of nights ago, which came recommended. Good fun. Mentioned this to Jonny Bairstow after he batted yesterday. \u201cOf course you (expletive) went to Mojo.\u201d If anyone wants to find me on Friday night, I\u2019ll be there again. OH, GOOD NEWS: the covers are coming off! Sure enough, the world leader impersonating other players is Glenn Maxwell. Skip to about 1:30. The Smith/Langer bits are ridiculously good. What a gem. I hope he\u2019s having a great time at Lancs. Hello from Headingley. As JP has explained, it is not a pleasant morning up here, but this grottiness really shouldn\u2019t last. From my vantage point, I see dark clouds to my right but brighter sky to the right. The rain is light and annoying, not sufficient to raise a brolly. What did we think of England\u2019s decision? I don\u2019t mind it. Putting to one side the ~look up before you look down~ mythology about the toss at Leeds, the idea of putting Australia\u2019s weakened batting line-up under maximum pressure on morning one makes sense to me. Urgh, ignore what I said a paragraph ago about the umbrellas - they\u2019re up now, as the ground staff lay out the run-up covers. As my great, great (great?) uncle wrote 120 years years ago, Such Is Life. I trust we all got a look at this video of Jofra? I was watching it all play out in the nets yesterday, picking up on the first of his several lightsaber leaves. He\u2019s going to walk out this week and do this impersonation in a Test Match, isn\u2019t he? It\u2019s his sport now. I expect we have some time to kill. You know the drill: email your considered prose, tweet me your hottest takes. Good morning. Right, that\u2019s all from me for now. Adam Collins has survived a tour of duty along the Western Terrace and he\u2019s taken his seat in the media centre. I\u2019ll catch you back here tomorrow. \u201cSurely the Wedding Present must head up the list up of any indie/hipster favourites from Leeds\u201d emails Tom Lewsey. \u201cOne of the coolest album covers of all time as well...\u201d Terrific call. \u201cWith all this talk of Archer, let\u2019s not forget that Broad only needs two wickets here to become Headingley\u2019s leading wicket taker,\u201d emails Luke Woodward. \u201cI wonder what it is about this ground that the Nottinghamshire lad likes so much?\u201d Maybe The Original Oak on Otley Road? I\u2019ve sunk a few pints in there in my time. \u201cIn response to Matthew Doherty\u2019s question about Neil Mallendar, the answer is that he was umpiring at the Oval yesterday in the drawn Surrey v Hampshire County Championship match. He didn\u2019t move any too quickly at the end of the over, either.\u201d Thanks, Alan Trench. Back to the chat... \u201cScott Roberts should ask Steve Finn about bowling wicket to wicket. Not as easy as it looks.\u201d Quite, Tom Carver. And just like that, the covers are back on again. Sorry. Australia have made three changes to their line-up. Marnus Labuschagne replaces the concussed Steve Smith as expected and there\u2019s little surprise to see James Pattinson returning to the attack in place of Peter Siddle after he was rested for Lord\u2019s. However, the recall of Marcus Harris at the expense of Cameron Bancroft has caught a few people off-guard. England have named an unchanged XI. There is a reshuffle to the batting order though with Jos Buttler returning to No.7. Bold from Joe Root, although with the floodlights on and the weather around you can empathise. Tim Paine was probably going to bat but was happy to lose the toss so as not to make the decision. He fancies Nathan Lyon later in the Test. Scott Roberts with an email that chimes with thoughts I\u2019ve often had. \u201cNow that people have FINALLY realised that Archer\u2019s danger derives as much from the fact that he bowls from close to stumps with a high action as it does from his raw pace, it does beg the question\u2026.why don\u2019t all bowlers bowl wicket to wicket like him? If you look at all the best fast bowlers in recent years, every single one bowls/bowled from close to the stumps\u2026..McGrath, Pollock, Ambrose, Philander, Steyn, Asif, Gillespie\u2026.some of these lads weren\u2019t bad.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t agree with Stefan Glosby when he says he feels disappointed by the prospect of beating Australia because of Smith\u2019s injury, and that he\u2019d probably feel different if it had been a McGrath-style freak accident,\u201d emails Dan Collins. \u201cSmith was hit fair and square and, while I\u2019d rather he could play, that\u2019s cricket.\u201d I told you all to stop. That means you, Richard Jansz-Moore. \u201cIan raises an excellent point. Let\u2019s get rid of Ed Smith, James Taylor and the rest of the \u201cmetropolitan elite experts\u201d who call themselves selectors. Each test squad should be chosen by a public ballot. I for one will be voting for Rob Key as I\u2019d quite like to get his chirpy burblings off the TV, and make him face Pat Cummins instead.\u201d \u201cWhere is Neil Mallender when you need him?\u201d asks Matthew Doherty. I presume this is in reference to the medium-pacer\u2019s call-up from a lifetime of County service back in 1992. More on that below. Oliver Smiddy is risking the mother of commentator\u2019s curses. \u201cWarner looks shot to me.\u201d Gulp! \u201cI wonder how much rope the Aussie selectors will give him? He\u2019s not scoring runs, and has regularly shelled important catches in the slips this series. About the only purpose he serves at present is to act as a lightning rod for the crowd\u2019s ire. With Bancroft dropped and Smith convalescing, he\u2019s the only member of the Sandpaper Trio (sounds like a bluegrass band) still in the team \u2013 remove him and who would the crowd boo then eh? My jinx game is strong though, so I imagine he\u2019ll get a ton by tea now.\u201d Jonny Mills with an email that pivots unexpectedly. \u201cRE: Bob O\u2019Hara\u2019s observation about the joys of English weather... it\u2019s something I miss too. Here in northern Italy there\u2019s no rain or cloud for months and then you get a quarter-years worth in a couple of hours. Sadly, although Brescia have a team and have been champions of Italy many times over I\u2019ve never been able to see a game played here or even find out where teams play! This is partly due to ever-more nationalist politics cracking down on supposedly \u201cethnic\u201d sports being played in public spaces, some lads were fined for playing in a park in nearby Montichiari during the World Cup... talk about killjoys.\u201d Official: Toss at 11.05, start at 11.20. \u201cWeather update from my office window - approximately half a mile from Headingley stadium - it is not raining but it is rather grey and overcast. Also, I\u2019ve got tickets for Day 4 which means we\u2019re nailed on for a result inside two and a half days, even with the weather.\u201d Thanks Sam Smith (presumably not that one). The scene is clearing at Headingley. We should be cossing the toin very soon. Ben Powell is trying to prove his hipster credentials. \u201cShowing my age I guess,\u201d he emails, \u201cbut I\u2019d have preferred an opening of \u201cLeeds, home of The Mission and The Sisters of Mercy\u201d, with perhaps a link to some grainy late 80s footage, maybe from The Tube, or The Temple of Love or Severina. Niche, granted, but would have been appreciated here.\u201d Remember earlier on when I said Australia were employing an entirely new cordon? Well, the early signs are it might take some time to bed in, thanks to the merciless Yorkshire CCC Twitter account. Spotter\u2019s badge: John Ashdown. David Seare brings the realism. \u201cRegarding the absence of Robo-batter (Steve Smith), England have to play what\u2019s in front of them and give that set of players due respect. Warner is due and Labuschagne seemed to have his game in order last week. It\u2019s not as if England have been keeping the scorers busy on a regular basis is it?\u201d \u201cIan Batch (10.20) echoes my own thoughts in it not being just about the pace,\u201d emails Geoff Wignall. \u201cAs well as Archer\u2019s unchanging action and point of delivery, there\u2019s also the small matter of skill - accuracy, movement, seam positions, variety of speed. Devon Malcolm was probably as quick as Malcolm Marshall for example, but there\u2019s no doubt which of them any batsman would have preferred to face.\u201d \u201cI feel Stuart Morphet\u2019s pain as he seeks assurance in a world of chaos,\u201d emails Ian Copestake. \u201cAm sure that pushing experts to one side and letting the people decide is the way forward.\u201d Stop it. Stop it now. All of you. TMS: For overseas listeners, here\u2019s your TMS link for the day. England are home and hosed, Gary\u2019s got his lucky shirt on. Bob O\u2019Hara\u2019s joined in. \u201cWhen I lived in Finland, I would sometimes miss the grey drizzly Leeds weather: the Finnish rain knew it had to fall, and did it with purpose, rather than hanging around trying to be fog. There\u2019s something comforting about the indecisiveness of the English weather.\u201d \u201cThink about bowling, but bat anyway,\u201d says Mark Taylor with the predictability of Matt Le Tissier lining up a penalty. Jimmy Anderson is heading in the right direction for a return to Ashes action in the fourth Test at Old Trafford. Stefan Glosby with a thought worth sharing. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m alone in thinking this, but I can\u2019t help feeling a bit disappointed by the prospect of beating Australia because of Smith\u2019s injury. I\u2019d probably feel different if it had been a McGrath-style freak accident, as opposed to him being hit on the neck by a bouncer (not that I lay any of the blame on Archer, I must add), but it just feels a bit hollow now.Maybe it\u2019s just me.\u201d I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not alone there Stefan. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that \u2018prospect\u2019 is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that comment and England cricket fans must know by now not to count any chickens. \u201cThe land of the actual Kaiser Chiefs\u201d is the type of email I enjoy opening - so thanks Trevor Tutu. That is of course in reference to the Kaiser Chiefs (see preamble) a band from Leeds named after a football team from South Africa. Anyway, Trevor emails to say: \u201cGoing past Newlands to check on the preparations for the New Year\u2019s Test, and, as everything seems to be under control, I\u2019m going to spend the rest of the day pretending to work, but really keeping up with the goings on at Headingly in the company of the OBO.\u201d Pleasure to have you on board. Hope there\u2019s less drizzle in Cape Town. Adam Collins is reporting from the scene, serving me with bad news: \u201cthe main cover and the two along the side are now on.\u201d But also some good: \u201cPlayers still out on the field. Aus doing short fielding drills, Eng slips catching.\u201d We\u2019ll keep you updated. Toss is scheduled for five minutes from now, so we may be in for a delay. Boooooo. The floodlights are coming on at Headingley and the covers are doing their business while some of that fine rain, you know, the kind that soaks you right through, floats across the ground. How important is Steve Smith? Ian Batch has taken issue with Geoff Lemon\u2019s column about Australia\u2019s preparedness to face Jofra Archer. \u201cFacing one bowler at 90mph is not the same as facing another. The reason Archer hits so many batsman (11 times) last Test, is that there is no difference in his action when he bowls a full length or a short one, which makes him unique, added to that he bowls from so close to the stumps that the batsman has no angle to work with. So much of facing fast bowling is anticipation and looking for the slightest tell to help you react in time, because there are none with Archer you simply don\u2019t have time to get out of the road. That said, it is the full length which is the most dangerous at Headinglye so hopefully he will be concentrating on nicking off as many batsman as he is hitting them.\u201d Andy Bull has provided some context and a sense check following the avalanche of hyperbole that greeted Jofra Archer\u2019s debut. We get so worked up about what\u2019s in front of us we cannot believe it was ever any better. There is a school of thought that bowlers are bound to be faster now, simply because of the advances in sport science, strength and conditioning. Records progress, the argument goes. Except no one has come within 20cm of Mike Powell\u2019s long jump world record in almost 30 years and Seb Coe still holds the British 800m record set in 1981, and the time Jim Hines ran in the 1968 Olympic 100m final would have won him bronze at the world championships in 2017 in a dead heat with Usain Bolt. Stuart Morphet has logged on, ironically I\u2019m assuming/hoping. \u201cFastest pitch in England you say? Archer causing chaos at Lord\u2019s? Oh it has to be a bowl, whatever the clever machines say. After all, I think we\u2019ve all had quite enough of experts in this country.\u201d Ali Martin was within earshot of Joe Root when the England skipper talked up his side\u2019s chances of exploiting Steve Smith\u2019s absence. You get these swings within a big series like this and when you get your opportunity you\u2019ve got to jump on it. It is a huge hole. He is a big focal point of their team and we have got to try to capitalise. \u201cFinally, after an interminable three days, we are back to the races! After Edgbaston it was all Smith; after Lords it was all Archer. Gotta love it. Is there any device to say when the conditions will be cloudy, because it seems that overhead conditions are at least as important as the pitch conditions?\u201d Shankar Mony, this is Yorkshire, presume it is cloudy unless stated otherwise. \u201cAlso, will Joe Root overbowl Archer and lead him to an early retirement by the Oval (by then he will be Sir Jofra, of course!).\u201d That is an excellent question and one deserving plenty of scrutiny once England are in the field. This has so far been a series dominated by bowlers. As Vic Marks reports the most acute batting issues have been at the top of the order. It looks like Australia have blinked first with the expected demotion of Bancroft for Harris. The technical reasons are clear. The white ball does not swing as much; Roy\u2019s role is to attack, to exploit the early gaps in the field and that suits him well; a few failures when playing an expansive game is an occupational hazard readily accepted. In ODI cricket the best place to bat is usually at the start of the innings. That rarely applies in Test cricket. Look at the struggles of Warner and Bancroft as well as England\u2019s desperate, recent searches to find someone to bat there. The best bowlers are fresh, the ball swings, the nicks carry and the slip cordon is well-populated. Pitch: Reports from the middle are coming back indicating the deck will be dry and already hinting at cracking. That would surely make it a bat-first toss to win, but then this is Headingley, and it\u2019s cloudy, and the heebie-jeebies can grab you by the short and curlies and convince a captain otherwise. \u201cGood morning, Jonathan.\u201d Good morning James Debens, in with the opening salvo at .01 past the hour. Very sharp indeed. \u201cIf the only change England make is to the batting order by swapping Joe Denly and Jason Roy around, then it should be a significant one.\u201d Agree 100%. \u201cLooking ahead, and the Ashes is no place for bedding in young talent, I\u2019d like to see Dom Sibley, Sam Northeast and Olly Pope get a nibble on tour.\u201d Agree 100% I\u2019m disappointed Pope hasn\u2019t been backed in more by the England selectors to be honest. His ceiling is surely way higher than Vince or Denly and worth a few early low scores. Jofra Archer is the talk of the town but as Geoff Lemon writes, Australia have the experience to withstand England\u2019s special new tyro. Archer\u2019s fast and furious visit to Lord\u2019s probably left its deepest impression locally. Or to put it another way, England\u2019s shock at having a fast bowler is much greater than Australia\u2019s shock at facing one. Weather: The forecast is for a cool, but at this stage largely dry, Test match. Today\u2019s weather is expected to be the poorest of the bunch but after some dawn drizzle the scene looks to be set fair. I say fair, this is Yorkshire*, so we can make do with slate grey foreboding overcast conditions and call them fair. *I say this as a Tyke myself. Some early team news filtering through from Headingley. Marcus Harris is in line for a slightly unexpected call-up. Light the blue touch paper and stand well back, it\u2019s the opening day of the third Ashes Test from Headingley. You can follow it all here in time-honoured OBO fashion. As we venture to Leeds the series scorecard shows Australia holding a 1-0 advantage but there was a discernible shift in momentum England\u2019s way as the second Test unfolded. That was largely down to the exhilarating debut of Jofra Archer, and with him in England\u2019s XI and Steve Smith temporarily absent from Australia\u2019s, this third Test has taken on a new complexion. I\u2019ll be with you for the next hour or so to warm up the keys but Adam Collins will be in position before the opening delivery reaches the batsman. If you want to join in this pre-play fun before Adam arrives you can drop me an email or a tweet.",

      "bodyText": "The environment minister of Brazil, where wildfires have been sweeping the Amazon rainforest, was booed at a climate event on Wednesday as celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio and Ariana Grande joined an international chorus of criticism. Videos of Ricardo Salles being booed by demonstrators as he took to the stage at Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week in the north-eastern city of Salvador circulated widely in Brazil. An opposition senator is planning to seek his impeachment at Brazil\u2019s supreme court. On Wednesday, the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, suggested NGOs were to blame for the surge in rainforest blazes because they lost money under his administration \u2013 but provided no evidence for his claim. Salles flew over fires in the Amazon state of Mato Grosso \u2013 an agricultural powerhouse \u2013 on Wednesday, and told reporters that some of the fires were \u201cintentional\u201d and others \u201cincidental\u201d. \u201cIt is drier, warmer, with more wind, and this allows a greater spread,\u201d Salles said, according to the O Globo newspaper. Analysts said the Amazon has become a political problem for Bolsonaro, who wants to develop the rainforest and has told foreigners to mind their own business. On Thursday, UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres tweeted that he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the fires. \u201cThe Amazon must be protected,\u201d he posted. \u201cA perfect fire, rather than a perfect storm, is forming,\u201d said Marcus Melo, a professor of political science at the Federal University of Pernambuco. \u201cThese are important political losses.\u201d Nasa tweeted photos of smoke and fires over several Amazon states, saying that while blazes are common in these drier, winter months, \u201cthe number of fires may be record-setting\u201d. Fires are up by more than 80% so far compared with last year, according to Brazil\u2019s space research institute. Environmentalists blame Bolsonaro\u2019s attack on environmental protection agencies and plans to develop protected indigenous reserves for inflaming deforestation. The Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper reported that in some regions farmers emboldened by Bolsonaro\u2019s rhetoric planned \u201cfire days\u201d to burn pasture and areas being deforested. More than three million people liked a photo of burning forest that Leonardo DiCaprio shared on his Instagram feed. \u201cTerrifying to think that the Amazon \u2026 has been on fire and burning for the last 16 days running, with literally no media coverage whatsoever! Why?\u201d he posted. \u201cThe largest rainforest in the world is on fire,\u201d Ariana Grande posted on her Instagram story. She also criticised the perceived lack of media attention. Leading figures in the agribusiness sector, which is key to Bolsonaro\u2019s support and represents nearly a quarter of Brazil\u2019s GDP, warned that outrage over his environmental policies would hurt exports and could scupper a trade deal between the South American trade block Mercosur and the European Union. \u201cWe are paying a very high price,\u201d the former agriculture minister and soybean baron Blairo Maggi told business daily Valor recently. \u201cAgribusiness sectors who know that this [rising deforestation] is going to create problems for market access, for product price, are beginning to mobilise,\u201d Marcello Brito, the president of the Brazilian Agrobusiness Association, told Valor on Wednesday. Melo, the political scientist, said an unusual \u201carc of alliance\u201d was forming between agribusiness and environmentalists. But Bolsonaro and his ministers are unlikely to change tack until the real economic consequences of their assault on the rainforest become apparent, said Paulo Ba\u00eda, a professor of political science at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Instead they will double down on nationalist rhetoric. \u201cThey are doing what they want for the public that supports them,\u201d he said.",

become a \u201cthird country\u201d in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a video message, Spelman said she would not support any efforts to remove Johnson as prime minister and backed his pursuit of a Brexit deal. \u201cI do not support Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s initiative and I would not support a government led by him,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe position taken by Boris Johnson \u2013 that we will be leaving the EU on 31 October but he would prefer we did so with a deal \u2013 is one I entirely support and I wish Boris Johnson every success in those negotiations.</p> \n<p>\u201cHowever, [if] the reality is that he is not able to conclude those negotiations, we will be leaving without a deal because that is what the law states.

      "bodyText": "The head of two of the Home Office sections at the centre of the Windrush scandal has told staff he will be stepping down next year. Mark Thomson, the director general of HM Passport Office (HMPO) and UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI), will be replaced in March and then take on a number of advisory roles and non-executive directorships. Both departments will have key roles issuing passports and visas post-Brexit, particularly if the UK leaves without a deal. His departure is a fourth blow to the government\u2019s Brexit planning. It comes after Sir Jon Thompson quit as the head of HMRC, Karen Wheeler, who was in charge of Brexit border delivery at HMRC, retired, and Tom Shinner left his job in charge of no-deal planning at the Department for Exiting the European Union for a role in the private sector. Thomson\u2019s sections of the Home Office have been under pressure since they were criticised by a home affairs select committee report last year. UKVI in particular was criticised for demanding a standard of proof from applicants which could not be met. Thomson became the head of the passport office in 2015, shortly after it was stripped of its executive agency status and instead made a division within the Home Office. He was made head of UKVI the following year. When he was initially appointed, his salary of \u00a3164,000 was criticised for being paid 60% more than his predecessor. He had previously worked for the Royal Mail for nearly 30 years. Thomson, in a leaked email sent to staff, disclosed that his job is now being advertised. \u201cThe sharp eyed amongst you may notice that my job has been advertised today. I wanted to let you all know that after five years in the Home Office I have decided the time has come for me to move on and leave my position as director general of UKVI and HMPO,\u201d he wrote. He said that he planned to take up \u201ca small portfolio of advisory roles and non-executive roles\u201d. It has also recently emerged that Home Office profits on UK visas had surged by millions of pounds a week since visa operations were outsourced. An investigation by Finance Uncovered and the Independent revealed that the UK government made \u00a31.6bn from visa applicants in the five years since it outsourced the bulk of its overseas visa services to the Dubai-based firm VFS \u2013 a ninefold increase on the five years before. The company, which has its headquarters in the United Arab Emirates but is owned through holding companies in Jersey, the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, has been accused of \u201cgross maladministration\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d selling of optional services since taking the contract in 2014. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cMark Thomson has made the decision to leave his post in March 2020 for personal reasons. His departure will be phased to ensure minimal disruption to both HM Passport Office and UK Visas and Immigration.\u201d",

This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.</p>\n    <p>Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.</p>\n    <p>The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.</p>\n    <p>Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u2019s customs union permanently if the UK &amp; EU cannot seal a free trade agreement.

It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p><b>Unilateral statement from the UK&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.</p>\n    <p><b>Additional language in political declaration&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson looked supremely relaxed as he met Emmanuel Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e on Thursday, at one point even jokingly resting one foot on an expensive-looking French coffee table. From one perspective, his laid-back demeanour was surprising: Macron\u2019s public remarks before their meeting made clear that the EU27 are a long way from acceding to the PM\u2019s request for a \u201cbackstop-ectomy\u201d on the withdrawal agreement. Instead, Macron underlined the importance of preserving the integrity of the single market and stressed that any solution reached in the short time left before 31 October would not be very different from Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement. But from another perspective \u2013 that of spiking the guns of restive backbenchers, and drawing up the battle lines for an early general election \u2013 Johnson\u2019s diplomatic mini-break has been a relative success. In particular, it should be no surprise that in Berlin on Wednesday, he seized on Angela Merkel\u2019s mention of seeking a solution to the Brexit challenge within 30 days. She was merely signalling the EU27\u2019s willingness to work quickly, rather than laying down a firm deadline. As she herself underlined on Thursday: \u201cIt is not about 30 days.\u201d But the idea that there is work to be done that could stretch well into September could help Johnson to survive the tense fortnight-long session of parliament before MPs leave Westminster once again for the party conferences. Jeremy Corbyn has made clear that his chosen strategy for preventing a no-deal Brexit is to trigger a vote of no confidence in Johnson\u2019s government, and then seek support in parliament for a time-limited \u201ccaretaker\u201d administration, which would exist only long enough to ask for an extension to article 50 and call a general election. Corbyn will be under intense pressure from the Labour movement to call that vote as soon as possible after parliament returns on 3 September \u2013 but potential Tory rebels, many of whom repeatedly voted for May\u2019s version of Brexit, might stay their hand, if they believe leaving with a deal remains a live possibility. Even for hardened Conservative remainers, voting with Corbyn to bring down Johnson\u2019s government is the most radical step they could take. They would not then be allowed to stand as Tory candidates at a subsequent general election, and may fear their seat at Westminster would simply be taken up by a Brexit party MP, or a Conservative more aligned with Johnson\u2019s agenda. As plugged-in former Tory Nick Boles made clear on Thursday, their favoured strategy is to try to legislate to seek an extension of article 50 \u2013 and Brussels is watching closely to see whether they can succeed. Meanwhile, Johnson is off to Biarritz on Saturday for the G7 summit; and the likelihood is that with every appearance on the world stage, he will appear more prime-ministerial \u2013 simply by virtue of the fact that he is prime minister, and in contrast with his often socially awkward predecessor. But while Johnson needs the diplomatic mood to be friendly enough to help him bridge that fragile fortnight, the outlines of a more combative general election narrative have also become increasingly clear this week, beneath the diplomatic gloss. He stressed repeatedly in Paris that the UK is determined not to impose border checks in the event of no-deal Brexit \u2013 subtext: any snarl-ups will be your fault, not ours. And in name-checking the report from Greg Hands\u2019 Alternative Arrangements Commission and stressing the \u201coomph\u201d the UK is putting into pursuing an agreement, he hopes to rebut in advance the accusation that he is charging headlong towards no deal. Instead, the blame will be laid squarely at the intransigence of Brussels (and Paris, and Berlin) \u2013 and the \u201cremainer wreckers\u201d in parliament.",

      "bodyText": "Mining and energy corporates have used paid lobbyists to access the Queensland Labor government 214 times in the past six years, analysis shows. The mining and energy sector is hugely influential in Queensland, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to political parties, and regularly gaining access to the most senior members of cabinet. A major Grattan Institute report released last year detected 191 contacts between the state government and lobbyists hired by the industry. The report found mining and energy companies accounted for more than a quarter of all recorded lobbyist contacts in Queensland between 2013 and 2018, vastly more than any other sector. The next biggest employer of lobbyists in Queensland was the property and construction sector, which accounted for 20% of lobbying contacts. The trend has continued since. Guardian Australia obtained and updated the raw data from the Grattan report, analysing more recent contacts by lobbyists hired by mining and energy companies. The analysis found a further 23 meetings between paid lobbyists for the mining and energy sector and the Queensland government since April last year. That included lobbyists hired by Adani, who met with a department head, but listed the subject of the meeting as \u201ccommercial-in-confidence\u201d. Lobbyists for Centrex Metals Limited, a company seeking to mine phosphate in north-west Queensland, met with a range of policy advisers, ministers and bureaucrats between January and June this year. Idemitsu Australia Resources, a Japanese-owned miner, had lobbyists repeatedly meet with chiefs of staff, advisers, agency heads and ministers in the six months between May and November last year. The raw Grattan data shows the sector donated $598,822 to all parties from October 2012 to April 2018, and secured 66 meetings with the premier, deputy premier or treasurer in the 15 months to March last year. It also shows that half of the major donors to the Queensland Labor party secured a meeting with the senior leadership team about the time of the last state election. The Grattan researcher and senior associate Kate Griffiths said donations and lobbying were common in highly regulated industries, like resources. But she said energy and mining companies \u201cpunch well above their weight\u201d in lobbying the Queensland government. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising these groups are knocking on doors \u2013 they have the most to gain (or lose) from government decisions \u2013 but policymakers need to be hearing from a wider range of voices,\u201d Griffiths told Guardian Australia. \u201cLobbying helps to introduce new ideas and reduces the likelihood of uninformed or damaging decisions by those in office. But some interests have a lot more opportunity to influence than others. Policy makers should be listening to interest groups with the best ideas, not simply those with money and connections.\u201d On Thursday, Guardian Australia revealed Queensland Labor was preparing to change its official platform to assert the party\u2019s support for the mining industry, as it seeks to reconnect with blue-collar voters. The state government earlier this week enacted new police powers to crack down on climate change protesters, a move decried by civil liberties groups and environmentalists. There is no suggestion that donations or lobbying has influenced those decisions. But Griffiths says there is broader concern about the extent of special interest influence on politics. That\u2019s backed up by successive Transparency International surveys, which show perceptions of corruption in government are at the worst levels on record. \u201cThere\u2019s real suspicion about special interest influence in Australian politics at the moment,\u201d Griffiths said. \u201cPoliticians are losing trust and should support transparency and accountability around money and access to show the public that they take their concerns seriously.\u201d \u2022 Guardian Australia only counted lobbyist contacts for mining and energy companies that have lobbied the Queensland government at least five times since 2013.

      "bodyText": "Indigenous deaths in custody have worsened in the 12 months since Guardian Australia released its Deaths Inside project, with 17 more deaths recorded since August last year. Analysis shows that government failures to follow their own procedures and provide appropriate medical care to Indigenous people in custody are major causes of the rising rates of Indigenous people dying in jail. In August 2018, an exclusive analysis of 10 years of coronial data found 407 Indigenous people had died in police or prison custody since the end of the royal commission in 1991. As of today, that figure has increased to 424. The federal government has failed to respond to two major reviews on Indigenous imprisonment delivered in that time. And, despite the offer of federal funding, only three jurisdictions \u2013 Western Australia, Victoria and the Northern Territory \u2013 have implemented a custody notification service (CNS) to match the life-saving program operating in New South Wales. The CNS is a 24-hour phone line for Aboriginal people taken into police custody. The NSW service takes about 15,000 calls a year, and only one Indigenous person has died in police custody since it was implemented 18 years ago. According to the federal government\u2019s own measures, the majority of recommendations dating back to the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody in 1991 have either not been implemented or only partly implemented. Guardian Australia\u2019s new analysis, which includes deaths reported via coronial findings, official statements and other means in the past 12 months, shows: The proportion of Indigenous deaths where medical care was required but not given increased, from 35.4% to 38.6%. The proportion of Indigenous deaths where not all procedures were followed in the events leading up to the death increased from 38.8% to 41.2%. The proportion of Indigenous deaths involving mental health or cognitive impairment increased from 40.7% to 42.8%. An increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to a medical episode following restraint from 4.9% of all deaths in the 2018 analysis, to 6.5% with new data in 2019. Indigenous women were still less likely to have received all appropriate medical care prior to their death, and authorities were less likely to have followed all their own procedures in cases where an Indigenous woman died in custody. One of the cases that involved an Indigenous woman who was not given the appropriate health care in custody was Wiradjuri woman Rebecca Lyn Maher, who died at Maitland police station on 19 July 2016. In findings handed down last month, the coroner Teresa O\u2019Sullivan urged the NSW government to expand its service to include people who, like Maher, were held in protective custody. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, says he is keen to see the service offered in each state and territory and for protective custody. \u201cA CNS provides an important means by which to reduce the likelihood of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cThe services provide detainees with culturally appropriate health and welfare support and basic legal advice.\u201d The $2.25m Northern Territory scheme, which has only been operational for a fortnight, does not include people placed into protective custody for public drunkenness, or people picked up under \u201cpaperless arrest\u201d laws. \u201cWhile protective custody and paperless arrests are not included in the scope of the custody notification service, NT police are absolutely committed to the best possible safety for all detainees,\u201d the NT police minister, Nicole Manison, told Guardian Australia. The Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia (ALSWA) also brokered a $2.25m deal with the former Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion last November, topped up by $202,000 a year from the WA government. It has been trialling the system with selected police stations and the service is expected to be fully operational next month. \u201cPolice don\u2019t want further deaths in custody,\u201d the ALSWA director of legal services, Peter Collins, told Noongar Radio. \u201cWe\u2019re just hoping that if the service operates in the way it is designed to and the police respond in the way we expect them to, that it won\u2019t happen in the future.\u201d In Victoria, the scheme has been written into law and will begin operation on 1 October but funding is yet to be finalised. The South Australian, Queensland and Tasmanian governments have maintained their refusal to introduce a legislated custody notification service, saying they have equivalent procedures in place. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australian Law Reform Commission also recommended a national CNS, in a report provided to the federal government more than 18 months ago. The report was commissioned in 2016 by the former attorney general George Brandis, who described Indigenous imprisonment rates as a \u201cnational tragedy\u201d. The government has yet to respond to its recommendations, despite a desperate plea for action more than a year ago. Wyatt said he\u2019s aware the ALRC report had been with the government \u201cfor some time\u201d and was \u201ccommitted to considering\u201d it. He said state and territory governments had direct responsibility for tackling incarceration rates, but he was \u201cworking to improve outcomes for vulnerable youth through early intervention programs that identify at-risk children and assist in addressing the drivers that lead to offending behaviour and recidivism,\u201d Wyatt said. From the end of 2019, the Deaths Inside database will be maintained and developed by the Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous education and research at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). The UTS distinguished professor Larissa Behrendt said the database \u201censures people deeply impacted by the legal and justice system are more than a statistic\u201d. \u201cIt will be an important resource for community and for researchers,\u201d Behrendt said.",

She simply wanted to emphasis that time was short, she said. \u201cIt is not about 30 days. The 30 days were meant as an example to highlight the fact that we need to achieve [a solution] in a short time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/22/emmanuel-macron-backs-month-of-talks-to-agree-brexit-deal\">Macron tells Johnson Brexit backstop is indispensable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not for the first time, a British prime minister had misunderstood the German chancellor, who is reputed at home for her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/04/angela-merkels-influence-now-extends-to-german-slang-merkeln\">sometimes ambiguous statements.</a></p> <p>In Paris, Emmanuel Macron sounded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/22/emmanuel-macron-backs-month-of-talks-to-agree-brexit-deal\">cool about finding a backstop alternative in 30 days</a>, but struck a cordial note, saying that said no one was going to wait until 31 October without trying to find a solution.</p> <p>But behind the politeness and parades, nothing has changed. Merkel and Macron merely differ in style, rather than substance, when it comes to Brexit. The EU has long said it is open to considering \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to the backstop. But nobody expects them to materialise in 30 days and that is why the EU remains wedded to its Irish insurance plan.</p> <p>For the EU, the backstop is a guarantee of keeping the peace in Ireland, but also a defence against defective toys, poisonous shrimp or chlorinated chickens finding their way on to the EU\u2019s single market via a UK that will no longer be following EU rules. That is why Macron described the backstop as not just \u201clegal quibbling, but indeed genuine, indispensable guarantees to preserve stability in Ireland [and] to preserve the integrity of the single market which is the foundation of the European project\u201d. The backstop is where the EU\u2019s lofty peace goals and hard economic interests meet.</p> <p>Meanwhile diplomats have been unimpressed by alternatives proffered by a group led by Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan \u2013 the \u201cexcellent paper\u201d cited by Boris Johnson as his solution. Others are warmer, but think the alternative arrangements group does not offer answers in the short-term.</p> <p>Dropping the backstop would also send a disastrous message to the EU\u2019s smaller member states that they don\u2019t count as much as larger countries. It would also suggest Europe can be pushed around by stubborn leaders, not an idea the EU wants to convey in the time of Donald Trump.</p> <p>Behind the scenes the mood is gloomy. While Johnson\u2019s whistlestop tour was in full swing, one senior EU official commented that a no-deal Brexit is now \u201cthe working assumption\u201d. It is a view that has cemented following Johnson\u2019s recent statements.</p> <p>With 70 days until Brexit, the political schedule and parliamentary arithmetic are seen as working against a rejigged deal with the EU, such as a revision of the non-binding political declaration. These constraints boil down to two numbers: 22 and one.</p> <p>MPs have only 22 sitting days in parliament until 31 October, <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/parliament-role-before-31-october-brexit-FINAL.pdf\">according to the Institute for Government</a>, unless they decide to cut short the party conference recess or add extra sessions. And Boris Johnson has a majority of one.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the intersection of the parliamentary arithmetic and the political timetable, and the government\u2019s insistence on [leaving on] 31 October that drives us fastest to no-deal,\u201d one official said.</p> <p>The Brexit endgame will ultimately play out in London, rather than Paris or Berlin.</p>",

Yet Merkel quickly poured cold water over reports that she had set a 3o-day deadline to ditch the backstop. She simply wanted to emphasis that time was short, she said. \u201cIt is not about 30 days. The 30 days were meant as an example to highlight the fact that we need to achieve [a solution] in a short time.\u201d Not for the first time, a British prime minister had misunderstood the German chancellor, who is reputed at home for her sometimes ambiguous statements. In Paris, Emmanuel Macron sounded cool about finding a backstop alternative in 30 days, but struck a cordial note, saying that said no one was going to wait until 31 October without trying to find a solution. But behind the politeness and parades, nothing has changed. Merkel and Macron merely differ in style, rather than substance, when it comes to Brexit. The EU has long said it is open to considering \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to the backstop. But nobody expects them to materialise in 30 days and that is why the EU remains wedded to its Irish insurance plan. For the EU, the backstop is a guarantee of keeping the peace in Ireland, but also a defence against defective toys, poisonous shrimp or chlorinated chickens finding their way on to the EU\u2019s single market via a UK that will no longer be following EU rules. That is why Macron described the backstop as not just \u201clegal quibbling, but indeed genuine, indispensable guarantees to preserve stability in Ireland [and] to preserve the integrity of the single market which is the foundation of the European project\u201d. The backstop is where the EU\u2019s lofty peace goals and hard economic interests meet. Meanwhile diplomats have been unimpressed by alternatives proffered by a group led by Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan \u2013 the \u201cexcellent paper\u201d cited by Boris Johnson as his solution. Others are warmer, but think the alternative arrangements group does not offer answers in the short-term. Dropping the backstop would also send a disastrous message to the EU\u2019s smaller member states that they don\u2019t count as much as larger countries. It would also suggest Europe can be pushed around by stubborn leaders, not an idea the EU wants to convey in the time of Donald Trump. Behind the scenes the mood is gloomy. While Johnson\u2019s whistlestop tour was in full swing, one senior EU official commented that a no-deal Brexit is now \u201cthe working assumption\u201d. It is a view that has cemented following Johnson\u2019s recent statements. With 70 days until Brexit, the political schedule and parliamentary arithmetic are seen as working against a rejigged deal with the EU, such as a revision of the non-binding political declaration. These constraints boil down to two numbers: 22 and one. MPs have only 22 sitting days in parliament until 31 October, according to the Institute for Government, unless they decide to cut short the party conference recess or add extra sessions. And Boris Johnson has a majority of one. \u201cIt is the intersection of the parliamentary arithmetic and the political timetable, and the government\u2019s insistence on [leaving on] 31 October that drives us fastest to no-deal,\u201d one official said. The Brexit endgame will ultimately play out in London, rather than Paris or Berlin.",

In a statement, Sanders said she was \u201cbeyond proud\u201d to join the team of on-air contributors at Fox News. It is not uncommon for former administration and political aides to transition into network television: George Stephanopoulos, a former adviser to Bill Clinton, is an anchor at ABC News; Jay Carney, the former press secretary to Barack Obama, did a stint at CNN as a political commentator after departing the White House; Nicole Wallace, a senior adviser to John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, is a host at MSNBC.

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s television industry has found a new champion \u2013 or, rather, enabled an existing one to step forward. Dorothy Byrne is head of news and current affairs at Channel 4 and not someone who has cultivated a public profile. Her <a href=\"https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/channel-4/dorothy-byrne-mactaggart-lecture/5142165.article\" title=\"\">barnstorming speech</a> at the Edinburgh television festival on Wednesday will have made many in her audience wonder why not. This MacTaggart lecture was hardly a love letter to TV or journalism. It reflected on the sexism she has experienced throughout her career at length. But it did something else even more important, which was to issue probably the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/21/boris-johnson-media-strategy-vladimir-putin-channel-4-news-chief-dorothy-byrne\" title=\"\">strongest challenge so far</a> regarding the dramatic recent reduction in access to politicians granted to news programmes and reporters.</p> <p>Journalists are not always eager to draw attention to difficulties which can be viewed as a symptom of failure or decline. Ms Byrne went on the offensive, calling on interviewers to be tougher about calling out politicians\u2019 lies. But her fiercest ire was reserved for the party leaders she called \u201ccowards\u201d. Theresa May\u2019s longest Channel 4 interview of her prime ministership lasted seven minutes.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s television industry has found a new champion \u2013 or, rather, enabled an existing one to step forward. Dorothy Byrne is head of news and current affairs at Channel 4 and not someone who has cultivated a public profile. Her barnstorming speech at the Edinburgh television festival on Wednesday will have made many in her audience wonder why not. This MacTaggart lecture was hardly a love letter to TV or journalism. It reflected on the sexism she has experienced throughout her career at length. But it did something else even more important, which was to issue probably the strongest challenge so far regarding the dramatic recent reduction in access to politicians granted to news programmes and reporters. Journalists are not always eager to draw attention to difficulties which can be viewed as a symptom of failure or decline. Ms Byrne went on the offensive, calling on interviewers to be tougher about calling out politicians\u2019 lies. But her fiercest ire was reserved for the party leaders she called \u201ccowards\u201d. Theresa May\u2019s longest Channel 4 interview of her prime ministership lasted seven minutes. Neither she nor Jeremy Corbyn did a major broadcast interview at all in the run-up to May\u2019s European elections. But the first four weeks of Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership have plumbed new depths. Not only did he refuse to participate in Channel 4\u2019s Tory leadership debate, he has not yet given a major TV interview or press conference. Instead, he has made a two-minute policy statement and delivered a 13-minute monologue on Facebook Live \u2013 the latter laughably named \u201cThe People\u2019s Question Time\u201d, even though all the questions were voiced by Mr Johnson and not one other voice was heard. Starting in the US near the start of this century, and more recently in the UK, \u201cmainstream media\u201d (or \u201cMSM\u201d) has become a term of disparagement used by critics on both right and left for businesses seen as representing established interests. Of course, it is true that media owners are not neutral or objective players. In the UK, television news is governed by impartiality rules but our press is fiercely partisan, predominantly towards the right, and it is important that people understand this.

In his letter to the EU this week, he openly trumpeted \u201cdivergence\u201d in trading standards, regulations and tariffs within the island of Ireland.

What is Johnson talking about? A border is a border, wherever located. Trade divergence is divergence, a tariff is a tariff and a check a control.

The problem with using the government\u2019s underlying key stage 4 results for 2018 is that they only tell you about attainment in schools and whether they are based in poorer or richer districts, and nothing about the postcodes and census areas where their pupils live.</p> <p>An extreme example is Knowsley, Merseyside, where 43% of secondary school children are educated outside the borough, pushing their GCSE results to the bottom of the national tables. If the Ucas system can access university applicants\u2019 full postcodes, then why can\u2019t GCSE exam boards and the DfE get their act together?<br><strong>David Nowell </strong><br><em>New Barnet, </em><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Michael Segalov claims that Teach First\u2019s recent report throws \u201cthe entire validity of our exam system in the air\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/21/meritocracy-gcse-grades-pupils-society-exam-results\" title=\"\">Meritocracy is a myth \u2013 so don\u2019t judge people on their GCSE grades</a>, 21 August). To draw such a conclusion is facile: the solution to stymie the decline of social mobility is not overlooking exam results but ensuring that all have an equal opportunity to succeed in them.</p> <p>The reason for the attainment gap is multifaceted. Some inequalities, such as the differing home environments in wealthy and poor households, are intractable and will exist in perpetuity. The shortfall of quality teachers and schools in low-income communities, however, does not have to continue.</p> <p>Reversing cuts to school budgets is a necessary but not sufficient action. Driven young teachers need to be given incentives to practise in low-income communities. Furthermore, schools \u2013 particularly in northern urban areas \u2013 need to be provided with appropriate resources to train and invest in new staff. Likewise, co-curricular activities need to be encouraged, so pupils can acquire the \u201csoft skills\u201d that the children of wealthy parents have. Universities, too, can play a role by collaborating with secondaries to inspire and assist teenagers to go into higher education.</p> <p>Government funding is not, in isolation, a panacea; it is imperative that collaboration and targeted investment by school leaders accompanies it. <br><strong>James Smith</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

If the Ucas system can access university applicants\u2019 full postcodes, then why can\u2019t GCSE exam boards and the DfE get their act together? David Nowell New Barnet, London \u2022 Michael Segalov claims that Teach First\u2019s recent report throws \u201cthe entire validity of our exam system in the air\u201d (Meritocracy is a myth \u2013 so don\u2019t judge people on their GCSE grades, 21 August). To draw such a conclusion is facile: the solution to stymie the decline of social mobility is not overlooking exam results but ensuring that all have an equal opportunity to succeed in them. The reason for the attainment gap is multifaceted. Some inequalities, such as the differing home environments in wealthy and poor households, are intractable and will exist in perpetuity. The shortfall of quality teachers and schools in low-income communities, however, does not have to continue. Reversing cuts to school budgets is a necessary but not sufficient action. Driven young teachers need to be given incentives to practise in low-income communities. Furthermore, schools \u2013 particularly in northern urban areas \u2013 need to be provided with appropriate resources to train and invest in new staff. Likewise, co-curricular activities need to be encouraged, so pupils can acquire the \u201csoft skills\u201d that the children of wealthy parents have. Universities, too, can play a role by collaborating with secondaries to inspire and assist teenagers to go into higher education. Government funding is not, in isolation, a panacea; it is imperative that collaboration and targeted investment by school leaders accompanies it.

But rarely, if ever, has it rendered him all but speechless, as it did in the moments after Enable\u2019s final race in Britain here on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Enable\u2019s victory in the Group One Yorkshire Oaks was as straightforward as any in what is now a 12-race winning streak that dates back 27 months. Dettori led from the off, and when Magical, the only serious rival for the 1-4 favourite, drew closer in the straight, Dettori got the response he needed from Enable and crossed the line with a comfortable two-and-three-quarter-length advantage. It was not a ride to test the nerves or composure of a 30-year veteran like Dettori.</p> \n<p>Instead, a moist-eyed Dettori struggled for words afterwards because he knows that his partnership with Enable has almost reached journey\u2019s end. Her farewell to the British turf means that her racing career now has just two and a half minutes to run, as she attempts to sign off from the track with a historic third success in the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on 6 October.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really tearful because it\u2019s the last day she\u2019ll be running in England, so it\u2019s special,\u201d Dettori told ITV Racing\u2019s Oli Bell as Enable was led back to the winner\u2019s enclosure. \u201cI\u2019m emotional because she\u2019s so good. She\u2019s amazing and the turnout [to see her] is fantastic.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was 10 minutes before he could add much more, and start to look forward to the race in just over six weeks\u2019 time that could confirm Enable\u2019s status as one of the sport\u2019s all-time greats.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe felt absolutely tremendous,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cWe have to have sleepless nights until then [the Arc], but it was amazing. She had a very hard race in the King George [in July] and she was a bit tense today [before the race] but in the race she was fantastic.</p> \n<p>\u201cI love her so much that I\u2019m biased, but I haven\u2019t lost with her yet and we\u2019ve won everything. She\u2019s an amazing horse, she does it every way and she\u2019s uncomplicated with a big presence and a massive engine. I\u2019ll never have a horse like her in my life, with that longevity and the amount of big races that she\u2019s won.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8c87886-0d2f-4082-934a-72b62f20da24\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Ffos Las&nbsp;</b> <b>1.45</b> Lexington Quest <b>2.15</b> Tritonic <b>2.50 </b>Royal Residence <b>3.25</b> Gilt Edge <b>4.00 </b>Last Look <b>4.35</b> Motfael <b>5.05</b> Tigerskin&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>York</b> <b>1.55</b> Caradoc <b>2.25</b> Falcon Eight <b>3.00</b> Spartan Fighter nb<b> 3.35 </b>Battaash (nap) <b>4.15 </b>Fox Duty Free<b> 4.50</b> Fastman&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Newmarket 2.05</b> Thread Of Silver <b>2.40</b> Conga <b>3.15</b> Never Alone <b>3.50</b> Romola <b>4.25 </b>Great Bear<b> 4.55</b> Geranium <b>5.30</b> Concierge&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Goodwood 5.00 </b>Lethal Angel <b>5.35</b> Volkan Star <b>6.05</b> Forbidden Land <b>6.35 </b>Show Stealer <b>7.05</b> Whistler Bowl <b>7.35</b> Infanta Isabella&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Salisbury 5.15 </b>Fieldsman<b> 5.50</b> Hamish Macbeth <b>6.20 </b>Walkonby <b>6.50 </b>Governor Of Punjab <b>7.20 </b>James Park Woods <b>7.50</b> Fields Of Fortune &nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Chelmsford City 5.45</b> Foad <b>6.15 </b>Aljari <b>6.45</b> Deconso <b>7.15</b> Let Rip <b>7.45</b> Star Of Southwold <b>8.15</b> Mon Frere <b>8.45</b> Canasta&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A couple of bookmakers were still offering even money about Enable for the Arc on Thursday evening but most now make John Gosden\u2019s mare an odds-on chance at around 4-5.

She\u2019s got tough competition from the three-year-old boys and there\u2019s always going to be a sneaky three-year-old filly in there, that\u2019s for sure.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t right and at her best in the Arc last year [but] if she runs back to what she did in the Arc as a three-year-old [in 2017], which she looks like she is showing today, she might be tough to beat, but I do emphasise to watch out for the three-year-olds.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe has this amazingly competitive mind [and] she\u2019s just a great filly with a great constitution.

It was not a ride to test the nerves or composure of a 30-year veteran like Dettori. Instead, a moist-eyed Dettori struggled for words afterwards because he knows that his partnership with Enable has almost reached journey\u2019s end. Her farewell to the British turf means that her racing career now has just two and a half minutes to run, as she attempts to sign off from the track with a historic third success in the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on 6 October. \u201cI\u2019m really tearful because it\u2019s the last day she\u2019ll be running in England, so it\u2019s special,\u201d Dettori told ITV Racing\u2019s Oli Bell as Enable was led back to the winner\u2019s enclosure. \u201cI\u2019m emotional because she\u2019s so good. She\u2019s amazing and the turnout [to see her] is fantastic.\u201d It was 10 minutes before he could add much more, and start to look forward to the race in just over six weeks\u2019 time that could confirm Enable\u2019s status as one of the sport\u2019s all-time greats. \u201cShe felt absolutely tremendous,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cWe have to have sleepless nights until then [the Arc], but it was amazing. She had a very hard race in the King George [in July] and she was a bit tense today [before the race] but in the race she was fantastic. \u201cI love her so much that I\u2019m biased, but I haven\u2019t lost with her yet and we\u2019ve won everything. She\u2019s an amazing horse, she does it every way and she\u2019s uncomplicated with a big presence and a massive engine. I\u2019ll never have a horse like her in my life, with that longevity and the amount of big races that she\u2019s won.\u201d A couple of bookmakers were still offering even money about Enable for the Arc on Thursday evening but most now make John Gosden\u2019s mare an odds-on chance at around 4-5. Japan, who edged out Crystal Ocean in the International Stakes on Wednesday, is generally a 5-1 shot with Sottsass, the French Derby winner, and Crystal Ocean both on 9-1. \u201cThis was a lovely prep for her, a gorgeous race in its own right and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with her,\u201d Gosden said. \u201cIt was a nice stepping stone to the Arc, but I\u2019m very aware of the three-year-old colts [Japan and Sottsass]. She\u2019s got tough competition from the three-year-old boys and there\u2019s always going to be a sneaky three-year-old filly in there, that\u2019s for sure. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t right and at her best in the Arc last year [but] if she runs back to what she did in the Arc as a three-year-old [in 2017], which she looks like she is showing today, she might be tough to beat, but I do emphasise to watch out for the three-year-olds. \u201cShe has this amazingly competitive mind [and] she\u2019s just a great filly with a great constitution. The only time she got beat [in 14 starts] was because she got boxed in but that\u2019s life. I\u2019ve seen some wonderful racemares in my time and she\u2019s one of those.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A second attempt to repatriate the thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh has failed after the authorities failed to convince the refugees it would be safe to return. The Myanmar government had approved more than 3,000 Rohingya to be brought back to the country beginning on Thursday but, as during the first repatriation attempt in November, no refugees agreed to voluntarily board the buses to Myanmar. A Bangladeshi government official confirmed that four families, or about 18 people, from Shalbagan camp 26 in Cox\u2019s Bazar had initially expressed interest in going back. They had almost boarded a vehicle to cross the border, but were dissuaded by fellow refugees who told them they would not be able to return to their original villages or have a pathway to citizenship. A statement from the UN refugee agency said: \u201cSo far none of those interviewed have indicated a willingness to repatriate at this time. UNHCR will continue assisting the government of Bangladesh in this process to ensure that all those cleared for return are interviewed.\u201d Mohammad Abul Kalam, Bangladesh\u2019s refugee relief and repatriation commissioner, said on Thursday that efforts would continue over the next few days. UNHCR had only interviewed a third of the 3,450 refugees, or 1,037 families as part of the agency\u2019s intention surveys, he said. \u201cNone of the listed refugees turned up expressing their willingness to return to Myanmar today,\u201d he said. \u201cMost Rohingya who took part in the intention survey very clearly said that they were very afraid of their physical safety in Rakhine and this is the main reason they do not want to go to Myanmar now.\u201d Kalam expressed disappointment that repatriation had stalled again and said Bangladesh had \u201cdone our best to help the Rohingya return to their homes\u201d. He said the onus was now on Myanmar authorities to address the Rohingyas\u2019 issues \u201csincerely and convincingly\u201d. According to those in the camps, about 20 Rohingya refugees living in Kutupalong camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar crossed the border back to Myanmar of their own accord earlier this month, and have ended up in transit camps in Rakhine. \u201cThose four or five families disappeared from the camp at night,\u201d said Jafor Alom, a fellow camp resident. \u201cIn the morning neighbours found them missing. Days later, through some sources, it came to light that they were at a transit camp in Rakhine.

      "bodyText": "Three Extinction Rebellion activists involved in protests in central London in April have been convicted of public order offences at a trial which heard a message of support for them from the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. The men were among more than 1,000 people arrested during the environmental group\u2019s demonstrations \u2013 which caused large-scale disruption in what organisers described as the biggest act of civil disobedience in recent British history \u2013 but are the first to have gone on trial with legal representation. Patrick Thelwell, 20, from York; Peter Scott, 66, from Devon; and Samuel Elmore, 26, from Hyde End in Buckinghamshire were charged with offences including breaches of the Public Order Act 1986, obstructing a highway and obstructing police. They were discharged by Judge Richard Blake on condition that they do not reoffend in the next year. He found them guilty after rejecting the case put forward by their barrister, Russell Fraser, that they had acted out of necessity to make the government take steps to help avert the \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d from inevitable extreme global warming. Blake urged them to learn from this experience, adding that legitimate protests do not need to break the law. But at least one, Thelwell, said afterwards that he was committed to taking part in similar actions later this year. The trial at City of London magistrates court heard a statementfrom McDonnell, who said the mass protests in central London led directly to MPs debating and declaring a formal climate and environment emergency. The shadow chancellor said he and others had been inspired by the action taken by Extinction Rebellion in April, when sections of central London were shut down for days, and that the Labour party\u2019s policy programme had developed quickly and substantially as a result. \u201cThe activists successfully raised the profile of the climate threat and focused the minds of us all on the radical action that is needed,\u201d he said in a statement read out in the court. The court heard from each of the defendants, starting with Scott, a community choir leader and care home entertainer, who told the court he had started to become aware of climate change when Margaret Thatcher made a speech about it in the 1990s. He was initially excited about the progress made through international treaties, but quickly became disillusioned and came to the firm belief that swift action needed to be taken to stave off the danger to his three children and the next generation. \u201cThere has also been bread basket failures. Failures of fundamental crops,\u201d he said of recent events. Speaking of how global temperatures have increased on pre-industrial levels, he said: \u201cWe are about 1.1C. When we get to 1.5C and then 2C, [crop failures] will be much worse. We are talking food shortages and all the worst. Starvation at some point. At some point mass death. \u201cWithout disruption I am afraid nobody listens. We can stand with our placards on the side of Waterloo Bridge and watch all the cars go by and watch everybody ignore us. But what was happening was that there was an awful lot of people shouting \u2018emergency\u2019. We are in danger here and you have to make yourself heard,\u201d Scott said. He was followed by Thelwell, a student at the University of York, who stood unsuccessfully this year as a Green party councillor. He told the court that the famines to come would be part of the feared sixth mass extinction. Governments including the UK\u2019s were being \u201cwilfully genocidal\u201d, he told the court. \u201cThe reality is that people are dying today from the effects of climate change.\u201d Blake said he did not doubt the defendants\u2019 sincerity, adding that none of them were protesting \u201cbecause they fancied a lark\u201d and that their presence reflected their concerns about what they viewed as a potential climate disaster that threatened the future of mankind. He noted evidence from the police about disruption which had an impact on half a million travellers, including those of limited means who were unable to leave on hundreds of coaches from Victoria bus station. The case was not about freedom of protest, added the judge, who said the nature of the demonstration put enormous pressure on the Metropolitan police. \u201cIt should be known in a time when we are fearful of knife violence and the epidemic of robberies which we hear about in the city that the effect of this protest was to remove those officers from being able to police them, which is disappointing to say the least,\u201d he said.

His intent \u2013 to declare the small market town an independent sovereign state \u2013 was as visionary as it was bonkers. Today Hay-on-Wye, a pretty but otherwise unremarkable border town, thrives thanks to the remarkable legacy of its self-appointed monarch, who helped to establish it as a centre for the secondhand book trade and to create the environment in which the annual Hay festival of literature and arts was founded in 1988.

He loathed bureaucrats, a sentiment that expressed itself in myriad campaigns over the years \u2013 against the Welsh Development Board, the Welsh Tourist Board, and, latterly, the Welsh Assembly. Declaring Hay-on-Wye independent was not just about shooing off the pen-pushers. It was about forging a viable economic future for the quiet market town he loved so much. Long before terms such as \u201clocalism\u201d and \u201cdiversification\u201d were used in common parlance, he understood the imperative to step out of the mould and stake a claim for being different and distinctive. In the International Organisation of Booktowns, of which he was honorary life president, he found common cause with other book-besotted towns around the world, from \u00d2bidos in Portugal to Paju in South Korea. In 2004 he was appointed MBE for his contribution to tourism in Wales. He is survived by his third wife, Hope Barrie, whom he married in 1988, and by two of his three sisters, Joanna and Anne. \u2022 Richard George William Pitt Booth, bookseller, born 12 September 1938; died 19 August 2019",

By chance I was clearing out some shelves in the office yesterday and discovered a report written by Cummings in June 2014, a good two years before the EU referendum. It presented the findings of focus group research exploring attitudes towards the EU, and it concluded with a paragraph about what actually leaving the EU would be like. Cummings wrote:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Leaving the EU would be a huge and complex affair that would require resources far beyond the reach of any political party or normal campaign, and, in this author\u2019s opinion, would be an exercise far beyond Whitehall as it currently works. Those who want either substantial reform of the EU or leave will have to innovate. One obvious idea is to develop a roadmap and the framework for a new UK-EU treaty \u2018Wiki-style\u2019. Such decentralised movements have achieved astonishing things in science and could in politics.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When Cummings wrote this the referendum was just a promise from David Cameron, who was not expected to win a majority at the 2015 general election to implement it, and a vote to leave would have been regarded by many as an extremely remote possibility. A lot has changed since then, although not in the way the machinery of government works. Whether or not Brexit is an exercise \u201cfar beyond\u201d Whitehall\u2019s ability will be something Cummings will be in the process of finding out.</p> \n  <p>There is a reference to the Cummings paper, which was commissioned by the Business for Britain group, <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2014/06/30/my-report-for-business-for-britain-on-the-dynamics-of-the-debate-over-the-eu-and-a-small-but-telling-process-point-on-the-eu/\">on his blog,</a> but the link to the report no longer works. That\u2019s a shame because it is well worth reading. In it Cummings argues that recent mass immigration and the financial crisis have changed the dynamics of the EU debate, that Cameron\u2019s proposed renegotiation is unlikely to make voters feel more pro-EU, that an out campaign should avoid taking specific positions on many issues and that the best argument for leaving would be \u201cwe will save a fortune and we can spend that on the NHS or tax cuts or whatever we want to make Britain stronger\u201d. Most political strategy documents turn out to be unreliable guides to the future but this one is unusual because, five years on, its analysis seems prescient. Which is all the more reason for thinking Cummings might have been right about Whitehall failing to cope with Brexit too ...<br></p> \n  <p><em>UPDATE:</em> The full text of the report is available.

They include passing a law to mandate Johnson to extend article 50 to facilitate an election or second referendum; gaining support for revoking article 50 if there is no deal by 31 October; finding a way to bring the withdrawal bill back to the Commons; and defeating Johnson in a no-confidence vote before forming a caretaker government.</p> \n   <p>However, there are splits within the MPs fighting against a no-deal Brexit concerning the best plan, with some wanting to move straight to a no-confidence vote and others believing a legislative route to prevent a disorderly exit is the best option.</p> \n   <p>There is no agreement over who should lead a caretaker government \u2013 whether Corbyn or a veteran figure such as Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman. Nor is there agreement about what an extension to article 50 would be used for, such as a general election or second referendum.<br></p> \n   <p>A number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservatives</a> and independent MPs have said they could not support Corbyn as leader of a caretaker government but the Labour leader has insisted he is the only suitable candidate for that role.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> insiders said the party was feeling under increasing pressure to bring an early no-confidence vote soon after parliament returns even if it is not winnable yet, as it could show the prime minister just how close he is to losing control of No 10 by pursuing a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n   <p>Meanwhile, rebel Conservative MPs are still working on legislative ways to mandate an extension to article 50, but some are despairing over whether that is possible and have been returning to examining ways to go back to Theresa May\u2019s deal to test support for it against a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Today<strong> Nick Boles</strong>, the former Tory-turned-independent MP who was invited to the Corbyn meeting, has released the text of his reply, explaining why he won\u2019t be attending.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NickBoles/status/1164505982266937344\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Most of the MPs who led the successful attempt to stop No Deal Brexit at the end of March decided to put the interests of the country before the interests of their party, and their own careers.

But Boles disagrees, and he says he would not support such a vote while it remains possible that Johnson could achieve a Brexit deal.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) Interim government leader?</strong> Corbyn argues that he should lead any interim government set up following a successful no-confidence vote. Boles says that he would never support such a government, and that several other opposition MPs feel the same way.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>3) Legislating to require the PM to request an article 50 extension? </em></strong>Earlier this year MPs passed a bill tabled by Yvette Cooper requiring Theresa May as PM to request an article 50 extension. But by that point May was already committed to requesting an extension. Boles wants to use similar legislation for force Johnson to request an extension. But other MPs opposed to no deal have doubts about this strategy. It is not at all clear how binding legislation like this would be, in practical terms, on a PM who did not want comply. (For example, he could request an extension, but only half-heartedly.) And the bill would not compel the EU to agree to offer an extension.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>4) An early election?</em></strong> Boles argues that, to prevent the bill requiring him to seek an article 50 extension becoming law, Johnson would try to trigger an early election, to take place shortly after a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. No 10 has reportedly decided that, in those circumstances, it would ignore calls to delay Brexit pending the result of the election. Boles says an early election would only happen if Labour MPs were to vote for it, and he urges Corbyn to rule that out. But Corbyn\u2019s strategy for avoiding a no-deal Brexit depends on holding a no-confidence vote that could result in an early election (if Johnson were to lose the vote, and no alternative government were to get a majority within 14 days.)</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0dd47f6b0ddec8d7437fd9a71bb44831aa3dd57\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0dd47f6b0ddec8d7437fd9a71bb44831aa3dd57/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Boles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Boles</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-23T06:58:06.225Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d5e8b5b8f081cf11cf1b0f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-22T12:36:08.895Z\">1.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Mujtaba Rahman,</strong> the former European commission official who does Brexit analysis for the Eurasia consultancy, has a good take on the exchanges.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Mij_Europe/status/1164511606841184256\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EmmanuelMacron</a> has taken up &amp; amplified Merkel\u2019s 30 day challenge to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a>, arguing UK must produce \u201cvisibility\u201d on its alternative ideas for backstop within 30 days.

The point can\u2019t be to exit Europe and say \u2018we\u2019ll be stronger\u2019, before in the end, becoming the junior partner of the United States, which are acting more and more hegemonically.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a particularly neat twist, using the language of Brexiters to contest one of the main claims of the Brexit project, Macron even suggested that outside the EU, instead of being released from European vassalage, Britain would end up a vassal state of the US.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Can the cost for Britain of a hard Brexit \u2013 because Britain will be the main victim \u2013 be offset by the United States of America? No.</p> \n   <p>And even if it were a strategic choice it would be at the cost of a historic vassalisation of Britain. I don\u2019t think this is what Boris Johnson wants.

      "bodyText": "Emmanuel Macron has described the Irish backstop as \u201cindispensable\u201d to a Brexit deal and urged Boris Johnson to set out his proposed alternatives as soon as possible, as he met the British prime minister in Paris on Thursday. The former Conservative MP Nick Boles has demanded that Jeremy Corbyn rule out backing a general election that could lead to the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. Richard Braine, the new Ukip leader, has been accused of whipping up religious tensions and anti-Muslim prejudice after leaked emails showed he argued that people should no more want Muslims to settle in their country than Nazis. Immigration to the UK from the EU remains at its lowest level since 2013, according to disputed estimates from the Office for National Statistics. The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland has warned that the return of a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could revive paramilitary groups. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. It seems the Boris Johnson \u2018foot on the table\u2019 picture was not all that it seems. According to Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner, Johnson was responding to a jokey suggestion from Emmanuel Macron that the table would work well as a footstool. Johnson put his foot on the table only very fleetingly. As the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Bojan Pancevski says, the full photograph is superb. My colleague Jessica Elgot has more on the meeting that Jeremy Corbyn is holding next week with MPs from other parties to discuss efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit. This is from the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne. Boris Johnson has tweeted a picture of himself with Emmanuel Macron. In this one he\u2019s got his feet on the floor. Boris Johnson opted for the informal approach as he sat down with Emmanuel Macron in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. But is it really okay to put your foot on someone else\u2019s table when you\u2019re a guest? That would never have happened with Theresa May. UPDATE: Pictures do not always tell the full story. See 4.53pm. On the World at One Tony Smith, a former director general of the UK Border Force and a member of the panel advising the Alternative Arrangements Commission, said the EU should take its recommendations more seriously. Boris Johnson says the AAC\u2019s report shows why the backstop is unnecessary, because other mechanisms could avoid the need for a hard border in Ireland after Brexit. Smith explained: What [the EU] have missed is (a) that borders generally globally are going through a paradigm shift [with the] introduction of digital technology and systems, and processes. So the days in which I operated, when you are sitting out in a kiosk, checking papers on a border post, are disappearing anyway, globally. Regardless of what\u2019s happening in Ireland I think they need to give due weight to that and look a lot more closely - you know, you can actually have an invisible border. There are other ways of doing checks now because of technology. It\u2019s not just technology, it needs regulation as well and cooperation and goodwill. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s been lacking. We haven\u2019t been able to get traction at the right levels in the [European] commission with our report, and with UK officials, to be able to push this down to an operational level to talk about what practically can we do on both sides to deliver the border that we need. The Press Association report quoted Emmanuel Macron as saying he was seen as the \u201cthe hard boy in the group\u201d on Brexit (see 1.25pm), but this might not be the best translation. My colleague Angelique Chrisafis just translated it as \u201ctoughest\u201d in the group. What he said in French was \u201cle plus dur de la bande\u201d. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has clarified that when she spoke about Boris Johnson having 30 days to come up with a solution to the backstop yesterday, she was not setting a literal deadline. Speaking at a news conference in The Hague, she said: I said that what one can achieve in three or two years can also be achieved in 30 days. Better said, one must say that one can also achieve it by 31 October. It is not about 30 days. The 30 days were meant as an example to highlight the fact that we need to achieve it in a short time because Britain had said they want to leave the European Union on 31 October. (Some of us thought that it was clear that Merkel was only making a general point, and not referring to a date on the calendar, although Boris Johnson was happy to treat this as a firm timetable.) Merkel now seems to be saying that the deadline is 31 October. But this contradicts what Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said at his event with Johnson earlier. \u201cNo one will wait until October 31 to find the right solution,\u201d said Macron. Here is my colleague Angelique Chrisafis\u2019 take from Paris on the Merkel/Johnson meeting. David Davis may think that the government will be able to cope with a no-deal Brexit perfectly well (see 10.52am), but in the past Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff, took a very different view. By chance I was clearing out some shelves in the office yesterday and discovered a report written by Cummings in June 2014, a good two years before the EU referendum. It presented the findings of focus group research exploring attitudes towards the EU, and it concluded with a paragraph about what actually leaving the EU would be like. Cummings wrote: Leaving the EU would be a huge and complex affair that would require resources far beyond the reach of any political party or normal campaign, and, in this author\u2019s opinion, would be an exercise far beyond Whitehall as it currently works. Those who want either substantial reform of the EU or leave will have to innovate. One obvious idea is to develop a roadmap and the framework for a new UK-EU treaty \u2018Wiki-style\u2019. Such decentralised movements have achieved astonishing things in science and could in politics. When Cummings wrote this the referendum was just a promise from David Cameron, who was not expected to win a majority at the 2015 general election to implement it, and a vote to leave would have been regarded by many as an extremely remote possibility. A lot has changed since then, although not in the way the machinery of government works. Whether or not Brexit is an exercise \u201cfar beyond\u201d Whitehall\u2019s ability will be something Cummings will be in the process of finding out. There is a reference to the Cummings paper, which was commissioned by the Business for Britain group, on his blog, but the link to the report no longer works. That\u2019s a shame because it is well worth reading. In it Cummings argues that recent mass immigration and the financial crisis have changed the dynamics of the EU debate, that Cameron\u2019s proposed renegotiation is unlikely to make voters feel more pro-EU, that an out campaign should avoid taking specific positions on many issues and that the best argument for leaving would be \u201cwe will save a fortune and we can spend that on the NHS or tax cuts or whatever we want to make Britain stronger\u201d. Most political strategy documents turn out to be unreliable guides to the future but this one is unusual because, five years on, its analysis seems prescient. Which is all the more reason for thinking Cummings might have been right about Whitehall failing to cope with Brexit too ... UPDATE: The full text of the report is available. Jon Worth has sent me a link. A majority of MPs are opposed to a no-deal Brexit but they can\u2019t agree on what they should do to stop it happening. In her story today about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to invite the other opposition parties and some Tory rebels to a meeting next week to discuss tactics, my colleague Rowena Mason has a good explanation of what some of the dividing lines are. There are several separate plans to stop the UK crashing out. They include passing a law to mandate Johnson to extend article 50 to facilitate an election or second referendum; gaining support for revoking article 50 if there is no deal by 31 October; finding a way to bring the withdrawal bill back to the Commons; and defeating Johnson in a no-confidence vote before forming a caretaker government. However, there are splits within the MPs fighting against a no-deal Brexit concerning the best plan, with some wanting to move straight to a no-confidence vote and others believing a legislative route to prevent a disorderly exit is the best option. There is no agreement over who should lead a caretaker government \u2013 whether Corbyn or a veteran figure such as Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman. Nor is there agreement about what an extension to article 50 would be used for, such as a general election or second referendum. A number of Conservatives and independent MPs have said they could not support Corbyn as leader of a caretaker government but the Labour leader has insisted he is the only suitable candidate for that role. Labour insiders said the party was feeling under increasing pressure to bring an early no-confidence vote soon after parliament returns even if it is not winnable yet, as it could show the prime minister just how close he is to losing control of No 10 by pursuing a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, rebel Conservative MPs are still working on legislative ways to mandate an extension to article 50, but some are despairing over whether that is possible and have been returning to examining ways to go back to Theresa May\u2019s deal to test support for it against a no-deal Brexit. Today Nick Boles, the former Tory-turned-independent MP who was invited to the Corbyn meeting, has released the text of his reply, explaining why he won\u2019t be attending. The letter is interesting because it illustrates very well some of the divisions that Rowena was explaining. 1) No confidence vote? Many opposition MPs, and even some Tories think that the best way to stop Boris Johnson implementing a no-deal Brexit is to bring down his government through a no-confidence vote. But Boles disagrees, and he says he would not support such a vote while it remains possible that Johnson could achieve a Brexit deal. 2) Interim government leader? Corbyn argues that he should lead any interim government set up following a successful no-confidence vote. Boles says that he would never support such a government, and that several other opposition MPs feel the same way. 3) Legislating to require the PM to request an article 50 extension? Earlier this year MPs passed a bill tabled by Yvette Cooper requiring Theresa May as PM to request an article 50 extension. But by that point May was already committed to requesting an extension. Boles wants to use similar legislation for force Johnson to request an extension. But other MPs opposed to no deal have doubts about this strategy. It is not at all clear how binding legislation like this would be, in practical terms, on a PM who did not want comply. (For example, he could request an extension, but only half-heartedly.) And the bill would not compel the EU to agree to offer an extension. 4) An early election? Boles argues that, to prevent the bill requiring him to seek an article 50 extension becoming law, Johnson would try to trigger an early election, to take place shortly after a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. No 10 has reportedly decided that, in those circumstances, it would ignore calls to delay Brexit pending the result of the election. Boles says an early election would only happen if Labour MPs were to vote for it, and he urges Corbyn to rule that out. But Corbyn\u2019s strategy for avoiding a no-deal Brexit depends on holding a no-confidence vote that could result in an early election (if Johnson were to lose the vote, and no alternative government were to get a majority within 14 days.) Mujtaba Rahman, the former European commission official who does Brexit analysis for the Eurasia consultancy, has a good take on the exchanges. Here are the main points from what Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Boris Johnson said in their opening statements and Q&amp;A. Macron said the key features of the withdrawal agreement were \u201cindispensable\u201d. He said: I would like to say that the key elements of this agreement, including the Irish backstop, are not just technical constraints or legal quibbling, but indeed genuine, indispensable guarantees to preserve stability in Ireland [and] to preserve the integrity of the single market, which is the foundation of the European project. He said that any new version of the withdrawal agreement proposed by the UK would have to be very similar to the existing one for it to be acceptable to the EU. He said: We will not find a new withdrawal agreement within 30 days that will be very different from the existing one. He identified the \u201ctwo goals\u201d of the backstop that were non-negotiable. He said: The Irish backstop, as we call it, is a point that has been negotiated in the context of the geography of Ireland and the past political situation. So it is an important element that allows us first of all to guarantee the stability in Ireland and also the integrity of the single market. These are our two goals. When you talk about flexibility, well let me be very clear with you, these two goals have to be met. We therefore have to find a solution that guarantees the integrity of the single market. We have to be able to guarantee to companies, to citizens and consumers in Europe that comply with the rules of the European Union and whatever comes from a market that is not in the European Union is controlled. He backed what Angela Merkel said yesterday about the need for the UK to come up with an alternative to the backstop within 30 days. But he played down the idea that this amounted to a new timetable, arguing that in practice it would be impossible to wait until the end of October before deciding if a no-deal Brexit could be avoided. He explained: What Angela Merkel said yesterday and which is very much in line with the discussions we have had since the very beginning is that we need visibility in 30 days. I believe that this also matches the goal of Prime Minister Johnson. No one will wait until October 31 to find the right solution. He said it would be possible to find a solution by the middle of next month if there was goodwill on both sides. We should all together be able to find something smart within 30 days if there is goodwill on both sides. He also said the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, could be involved in finding an answer \u201cwithout totally reshuffling the withdrawal agreement\u201d. He played down the idea that he was the hard man in the Brexit process. He explained: I\u2019ve always been presented as the hard boy in the group but it\u2019s just that I have always been clear: a choice was made and we cannot just ignore it. We have to implement a decision taken by the British people. Johnson said that he had been \u201cpowerfully encouraged\u201d by his talks in Berlin last night about the prospects of reaching a deal. I want to make it absolutely clear to you Emmanuel \u2013 to the French people \u2013 that of course I want a deal. I think we can get a deal and a good deal. I was powerfully encouraged by our conversations last night in Berlin with our mutual friends. I know that with energy and creativity and application we can find a way forward for all our businesses and our citizens. He also said it was \u201cvery interesting to hear some of the positive noises that we\u2019re now hearing about the ways that [replacing the backstop] can be done\u201d. And this what some journalists and commentators are saying about the Q&amp;A. From AFP\u2019s Adam Plowright From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From my colleague Dan Sabbagh From Barron\u2019s Group\u2019s Pierre Brian\u00e7on From the Institute for Government\u2019s Georgina Wright Here we go again; just as when Boris Johnson met Angela Merkel in Berlin last night, his opening public exchanges with Emmanuel Macron were warm \u2013 and considerably friendlier than some of their comments about each other in the past (see 9.25am) \u2013 but there was nothing in what Macron said to suggest that a solution to the backstop quandary is any closer than it has been for months. Macron suggested that he was unhappy about being cast as the \u201chard man\u201d in the process. But he was also very clear that a mechanism was needed to protect the Northern Ireland peace process and the integrity of the single market, and he said any version of the withdrawal agreement drawn up by Johnson within the next 30 days that might be acceptable to the EU would be much the same as the one already on the table. There are polite ways of saying no, and harsh ways of saying no, and Merkel and Macron (in their public remarks, at least) have been charm personified. But four weeks ago Johnson was telling Merkel and Macron that the backstop would have go for a Brexit deal to be possible. This week, they are telling him, that on the fundamentals of what the backstop is all about, they are not willing to budge. For obvious reasons, Johnson is keen to put a positive gloss on all of this, telling journalists at the Q&amp;A that he came away from Berlin \u201cpowerfully encouraged\u201d. But, as students of Johnson\u2019s journalistic career know all too well, his analysis of developments in the EU has never been noted for its accuracy ... Macron says Angela Merkel said yesterday there would have to be \u201cvisibility\u201d within 30 days as to what an alternative to the backstop might look like. People would not wait until 31 October for a solution, he says. He says Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, will be involved in talks. He says, if there is goodwill on both sides, there could be a solution. He says he is presented as the hard man in the negotiations. But he wants a solution. However, he has been clear that we will not find a new withdrawal agreement within 30 days that will be very different to the existing one. He says the agreement could be amended, though. Johnson says he admires Merkel\u2019s \u201ccan do\u201d spirit. He says he thinks solutions to the backstop problem are available. He repeats the point about how the UK will not impose checks at the border. Q: What is the alternative to the backstop? Johnson says the reporter should read \u201can excellent paper\u201d produced by Greg Hands and other MPs proposing alternatives. (That is a reference to the Alternative Arrangements Commission report.) Johnson ends by saying: \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way.\u201d And that\u2019s it. Q: Isn\u2019t a no-deal Brexit a bit of a con? Johnson says a great deal of work has already been done to ensure that the transition on 31 October will be as smooth as it can be. He says he wants to ensure all the remaining necessary work gets done before the end of October. Q: Angela Merkel showed some flexibility in Berlin last night. Shouldn\u2019t you too? Macron says the Irish backstop has been negotiated, and it is an important element that guarantees stability in Ireland and the integrity of the single market. As for flexibility, these two goals must be met. He says the EU has to guarantee to its citizens that its market will be controlled. Johnson intervenes. He says under no circumstances will the UK government impose checks at the border. He understands the EU desire to protect the integrity of the single market. But he thinks that can be protected, while allowing the UK to leave. Boris Johnson starts with Brexit. He says he wants to make it clear that he wants a deal, and he thinks he can get a deal. He says he was \u201cpowerfully encouraged\u201d by his talks with Angela Merkel last night. But it is vital, if you have a referendum, that you do what the voters voted for. He says the UK will come out with a deal or without one. He says the UK-French relationship is extraordinary. Their troops are side by side in countries like Mali and Estonia. And it was the British and French, together with the Americans, who responded when President Assad used chemical weapons in Syria. He says the UK and France will work hand in glove at the G7 on issues like climate change and the environment. Whatever happens with Brexit, it is their joint ambition to deepen the UK/French relationship. He says French buses run on London roads. And TGV, the French trains, run on steel made in the UK. And London is one of the cities with the biggest French populations on earth, he says. Let\u2019s get Brexit done, and let\u2019s get it done \u201csensibly and pragmatically\u201d, he says. Emmanuel Macron starts. He says he is pleased to welcome Boris Johnson to Paris. But they have spoken on the phone already. He says the relationship between the two countries is central and immutable. He says it\u2019s a privileged relationship. The two countries have a long history. They have treaties that go beyond the EU. He says the engagement of both countries has always been constant. He says, inevitably, they will talk about Brexit. He says Johnson knows his position. He says he regrets the choice by the UK to leave. If he had been a British voter, he would have voted to stay. But the decision must be implemented, he says. He says he wants to ensure the EU is protected. The EU has negotiated an agreement with the UK. It is not up to an one EU country to renegotiate it. The key elements are indispensable. It is about preserving peace in Northern Ireland, and about preserving the integrity of the single market. He says, as a friend and ally of the UK, it is up to the UK alone to decide its destiny. France is preparing for all eventualities, he says. He says, no matter what, the future of the UK cannot but be European. Our geography speaks by itself. Macron ends by saying again how pleased he is to welcome Johnson. Boris Johnson has arrived. Emmanuel Macron is on the steps of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e waiting for Boris Johnson to arrive. Here is the scene outside the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron are expected to take two questions \u2013 one from a French journalist and one from a British journalist. Boris Johnson is due to arrive at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace shortly. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. During the Tory leadership contest Boris Johnson claimed (implausibly) that the chances of a no-deal Brexit were a million to one. Subsequently he has admitted it is more likely than that, but he has not gone as far as David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, who told the Today programme this morning that he thought the odds on that outcome were now \u201c50/50\u201d. It was now \u201ca high probability\u201d, Davis said. But Davis also insisted that the dangers of a no-deal Brexit had been overblown. Dismissing the claims in the Operation Yellowhammer document leaked at the weekend as \u201crubbish\u201d, Davis said: I think there will be some turbulence. There will be some bumpiness in terms of cross-border traffic and so on. When it was put to him that in the past he has said a no-deal Brexit would lead to nothing that a reasonably competent government would not be able to handle, he replied: \u201cThat\u2019s precisely what I think.\u201d The recently-appointed Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has ignited a furious row with the Scottish National party after claiming it was no different from other nationalist movements as it \u201cneeds an enemy to thrive\u201d. In an article for the Times (paywall), his first newspaper opinion piece since being appointed by Boris Johnson, Jack wrote: Scottish nationalists like to claim that theirs is a different kind of nationalism, somehow uniquely benign. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not sure I can spot the difference. Like nationalist movements the world over, it requires an enemy to make it thrive. It needs an \u2018other\u2019 to rail against. Jack, a staunch Brexiteer, accused Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP of inventing grievances; using \u201cthe Westminster system\u201d as an insult coded to attack the UK as a whole; and inventing a \u201cfiction\u201d that devolution no longer works. He said many fiercely proud Scots were comfortable being Scottish and British. Acknowledging the Brexit crisis was putting the union under strain, he blamed Sturgeon using \u201canger, bitterness and resentment\u201d over Brexit to promote independence. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, called on Jack to withdraw the piece on Twitter. Some SNP figures worry about the labelling. Humza Yousaf, Holyrood\u2019s most successful non-white MSP, and now the SNP\u2019s justice secretary, said last week at an Edinburgh fringe event he disliked the \u201cnational\u201d in its name. I do struggle with it, because people do associate it with all the various elements of nationalism that exist. [I] think people understand that we are an open and inclusive party. But do I think that the name can present us with some challenges? For sure. Libby Brooks, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent, said Sturgeon had addressed this point at another Fringe event the previous day. In 2017, Sturgeon said she would prefer another one but last week claimed to be \u201c100% comfortable\u201d with it. Other nationalist parties, she said, were not seeking independence like hers but were nationalist in an exclusive, xenophobic sense. She said: Scottish independence is not just at the other end of the spectrum of that, but on another spectrum altogether. The SNP today is and I think I can say it without fear of justifiable contradiction, the most pro-immigration party in the UK which is not what you would expect of a nationalist party, so my nationalism is rooted in a desire to make the country I live in as good as it can be. Last night I posted a summary of the immediate media reaction to the Angela Merkel/Boris Johnson press conference here. The pro-Brexit papers in the UK have put a positive gloss on what happened, with the Sun story, under the headline \u201cWe can Merk it out\u201d, saying that Johnson was delighted with the outcome, and the Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Express all splashing on stories implying the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has been reduced. But informed commentators are not so sure. Here is another round-up of what journalists and commentators have been saying about the significance of what was said at the Berlin press conference after they\u2019ve had a bit of time to mull it over. From the Guardian\u2019s Philip Oltermann From Politico Europe\u2019s Matthew Karnitschnig From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From Berlin Policy Journal\u2019s Henning Hoff From the Economist\u2019s Sophie Pedder From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From my colleague Jennifer Rankin From the Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster Boris Johnson received a more cordial welcome than he might have expected last night when he met the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin on his first trip abroad as PM. But today he is in Paris for lunch with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and their exchanges might be considerably more prickly. Macron has repeatedly accused the leave campaign, that Johnson led, of lying to the British public, of all the main EU leaders he has been least willing to make concessions to the UK over Brexit, and yesterday, in a two-and-a-half hour briefing with journalists (not mainly about Johnson \u2013 the UK is not that important to France \u2013 it was a marathon event because Macron is hosting the G7 summit at the weekend) Macron delivered two very unpalatable messages for his British counterpart. Macron said that renegotiating the EU withdrawal agreement was \u201cnot an option\u201d. Johnson says, without a renegotiation, there will be no Brexit deal. Macron suggested that Brexit would stop the UK being a great power. This was particularly provocative because Johnson claims that Brexit will enhance the UK\u2019s independence and prestige. But Macron argued that Brexit would leave the UK dependent on the US. He said: The British are attached to being a great power, a member of the security council. The point can\u2019t be to exit Europe and say \u2018we\u2019ll be stronger\u2019, before in the end, becoming the junior partner of the United States, which are acting more and more hegemonically. In a particularly neat twist, using the language of Brexiters to contest one of the main claims of the Brexit project, Macron even suggested that outside the EU, instead of being released from European vassalage, Britain would end up a vassal state of the US. Can the cost for Britain of a hard Brexit \u2013 because Britain will be the main victim \u2013 be offset by the United States of America? No. And even if it were a strategic choice it would be at the cost of a historic vassalisation of Britain. I don\u2019t think this is what Boris Johnson wants. I don\u2019t think it is what the British people want. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the will of the British people \u2026 to become the junior partner of the US. There are more accounts of what Macron said at his briefing at the Guardian, at HuffPost, at Politico Europe and at Reuters. My colleague Angelique Chrisafis has written a preview of the Macron/Johnson meeting which has some very good background on their relationship. Here is an extract. Johnson began pinpointing France as a problem long before he became PM. While being filmed for a documentary last year when he was foreign secretary, he said of France: \u201cWhy are they trying to shaft us?\u201d He called France \u201cnaughty children\u201d on the issue of Europe. He later denied he had called the French \u201cturds\u201d over Brexit. Johnson is well known in Paris for what the local media call his \u201cFrench-bashing\u201d for a domestic audience, notably as London mayor when he said his city\u2019s bike scheme was a Rolls-Royce to Paris\u2019s Citro\u00ebn 2CV. He said the Socialist government at the time, with its proposed high tax rate on the very rich, had been \u201ccaptured by sans-culottes\u201d running a \u201ctyranny\u201d of the like not seen since the French Revolution. \u201cTo be popular in the UK, do you always have to criticise the French?\u201d one French interviewer asked him as mayor. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he replied, saying he loved France. And here is her full article. Johnson is due to meet Macron at 12pm UK time. They are not due to hold a press conference, but both leaders are expected to make short statements to the media. Otherwise the diary is relatively light today. At 9.30am the Office for National Statistics is publishing migration figures, and at some point Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, is chairing the first meeting of the Freeports advisory panel. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

I don\u2019t know how familiar you are with this US publication.

Book lovers remembered that books aren\u2019t just for reading, they can also be beautiful objects in and of themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Thatcher was at the forefront of this great remembering, you sense, and he has a business that sources books \u201cbased on interest, author and even colour\u201d. Ah yes. This business of arranging books by colour of the spine, which \u2013 <a href=\"https://qz.com/quartzy/1097021/how-to-organize-a-bookshelf-and-what-your-system-says-about-you/\" title=\"\">while obviously ghastly</a> \u2013 enrages a certain type of person more performatively than burning rainforests or children being raised in shipping containers and so on. We shan\u2019t lavish much of our time on it today.</p> <p>Mainly because Thatcher has gone one better than this, offering clients the chance to buy a load of books, then have special dust jackets made for each in one shade, or as part of a wider image that coheres when they are all on the shelves together. Again, ghastly \u2013 but over to Thatcher. \u201cMy invention for the book jacket means that someone can have the complete works of Jane Austen, but in a certain Pantone chip colour that matches the rest of the room or with a custom image \u2026 Why settle for books that a publisher designed?\u201d</p> <p>In Pride and Prejudice, one of Miss Bingley\u2019s ruses for impressing Mr Darcy is to declare: \u201cWhen I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library!\u201d If only she\u2019d thought to expand this to \u201can excellent library of books jacketed in Pantone 2461 C\u201d, the story might have ended entirely differently.</p> <p>In truth, none of this literary interiors business feels a million miles from those fake antique book spines that can be bought by the yard, which for decades were widely accepted to be a sign of both pretension and philistinism. It seems times have changed. Of the shelves in Gwyneth\u2019s own LA dining room, which he curated, Thatcher says he stuck \u201cto a more rigid colour palette of black, white and grey, since it was less of a space where one might hang out and read\u201d. Or even eat.</p> <p>The occasion of this interview is that Thatcher has his first book out, entitled <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/for-the-love-of-books/thatcher-wine//9781423652151\" title=\"\">For the Love of Books</a>, which its publicity blurb assures me is itself \u201ca keepsake worthy of any bibliophile\u2019s collection\u201d. This keepsake-about-keepsakes precis somehow reminds me of an E Nesbit story collection I loved as a child, which had a story called The Town in the Library. It involved two children building a town out of books in their library, then stepping into it and finding that this town contained their own house, which duly contained their library, in which there was a town built of books. Into that town they then went, and so on, through all the towns in all the libraries. I can\u2019t remember how it ended. (I\u2019d like to find it and check, but unfortunately my husband\u2019s system for categorising our books is so aggressively opaque that it effectively amounts to enemy code, and should by rights be a matter for Bletchley Park.)</p> <p>Thatcher, meanwhile, has some amusing theories about where we are going, textually. \u201cPublishers like Taschen, Phaidon and Rizzoli are making these gorgeous oversize books on art, design and architecture,\u201d he says. \u201cI think people are collecting those as an alternative to looking at screens.\u201d Maybe. For me, the apogee of this type of book was United, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/andrew-baker/2351393/Sportsbooks-Dont-spill-your-coffee-on-United.html\" title=\"\">a 2006 coffee table book about Manchester United, which cost \u00a33,000 and weighed 30kg (four and a half stone)</a> \u2013 more than most coffee tables. Review copies were not available, so those who wished to cast a critical eye over the work were required to visit it at its publishers, where a chap in white gloves turned the 850 pages for them.</p> <p>As for Thatcher\u2019s theories about books that don\u2019t relate to their physical size or cover shade, he vaguely recommends classics such as Hemingway and Austen. Also, apparently, \u201cthe Stoic philosophers are having a moment now\u201d. Huzzah for the Stoics, who look set to sell like hot cakes through the wellness section of Goop for about 10 minutes, before falling out of favour to rival products such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2017/mar/31/the-10-best-cross-body-bags-in-pictures\" title=\"\">the perfect cross-body bag</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/05/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-to-pay-out-over-unproven-health-benefits-of-vaginal-eggs\" title=\"\">the latest bit of quartz to pop up your fanny</a>.

I feel a profound sense of obligation to protect Harry and his family from the unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana\u2019s untimely death.\u201d Well, quite. That said, in the year she died, Elton and Gianni Versace published a joint coffee-table book entitled <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a20731497/princess-diana-elton-john-relationship-timeline/\" title=\"\">Rock and Royalty</a>, which featured private pictures, including one of Diana and William and Harry.

Let\u2019s face it, Elton defending you against charges of excess is a huge mood, and I already tend to defend my own less justifiable purchases in the precise tone of voice he used to a court trying his former business manager, when asked about a \u00a3293,000 florist bill. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1374374/I-like-flowers-says-Sir-Elton-after-293000-florists-bill.html\" title=\"\">As he </a><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1374374/I-like-flowers-says-Sir-Elton-after-293000-florists-bill.html\" title=\"\">put it: \u201cI like flowers.\u201d</a></p> <p>Let\u2019s hope that \u201cI like private jets\u201d will prove an effective line of defence for Meghan and Harry.

Also, apparently, \u201cthe Stoic philosophers are having a moment now\u201d. Huzzah for the Stoics, who look set to sell like hot cakes through the wellness section of Goop for about 10 minutes, before falling out of favour to rival products such as the perfect cross-body bag, or the latest bit of quartz to pop up your fanny. Hey \u2013 as Seneca himself put it: enjoy present pleasures in such a way as not to injure future ones. Elton John and the problem with privacy With requisite ceremony, proper celebrity Elton John has swept into the row about Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s frequent uses of private jets this summer, in the manner of someone who believes he can only be helpful. As discussed in this column last week, these are the royal private jet flights critics seem most preoccupied with, as opposed to the private jet flights featuring Prince Andrew, currently lying low to avoid mounting questions about his longtime friendship with the recently deceased millionaire sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, owner of a US Virgin Islands property known locally as \u201cPaedophile Island\u201d. Sorry, where were we? Oh yes \u2013 Meghan! Something about a long weekend away with her husband and baby? Quite the scandal. Following the welter of allegations of hypocrisy, relating to the couple\u2019s eco campaigning, Elton this week took to Twitter to state hotly that it was he who paid for the private jet they used to reach his Nice home, in order to give them some much-needed rest from a few shifts down the royal appearances coalmine (my words, not Elton\u2019s). Furthermore, Elton asserted: \u201cPrince Harry\u2019s mother, Diana Princess of Wales, was one of my dearest friends. I feel a profound sense of obligation to protect Harry and his family from the unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana\u2019s untimely death.\u201d Well, quite. That said, in the year she died, Elton and Gianni Versace published a joint coffee-table book entitled Rock and Royalty, which featured private pictures, including one of Diana and William and Harry. She promptly froze him out for it, although the pair reconciled later that year in the wake of Versace\u2019s death. But back to the present day, where his intervention can only be of assistance to Meghan and Harry. Let\u2019s face it, Elton defending you against charges of excess is a huge mood, and I already tend to defend my own less justifiable purchases in the precise tone of voice he used to a court trying his former business manager, when asked about a \u00a3293,000 florist bill. As he put it: \u201cI like flowers.\u201d Let\u2019s hope that \u201cI like private jets\u201d will prove an effective line of defence for Meghan and Harry. Andrew, perhaps, will need something more artful.",

The PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualized GDP growth of around 1.5%. </p> <p>The most concerning aspect of the latest data is a slowdown in new business growth to its weakest in a decade, driven by a sharp loss of momentum across the service sector. Survey respondents commented on a headwind from subdued corporate spending as softer growth expectations at home and internationally encouraged tighter budget setting. </p> <p>Manufacturing companies continued to feel the impact of slowing global economic conditions, with new export sales falling at the fastest pace since August 2009. </p> <p>Business expectations for the year ahead became more gloomy in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012.

      "bodyText": "The strong pound has pulled Britain\u2019s stock market into the red. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has just closed 75 points lower at 7,128, down over 1%. Just in: Donald Trump has denied that America\u2019s economy is struggling (despite today\u2019s weak PMI report)... but taken another swipe at the Fed for not cutting interest rates faster. He won\u2019t be pleased to hear that two Fed policymakers - Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther Georgeand Philadelphia President Patrick Harker - have told CNBC they don\u2019t see the case for additional interest rate cuts following the central\u2019s bank quarter-point cut in July. More here. Time for a quick recap. A flurry of weak economic has highlighted that many advanced economies remain weak - a day before central bankers gather to discuss the situation. In a worrying sign, America\u2019s factory PMI has fallen into contraction territory for the first time since 2009. Data firm Markit reported that new orders have fallen, as manufacturers struggle to find new business. Markit also reported that Germany\u2019s factory sector is still shrinking, adding to concerns that it could fall into recession this autumn. France, though, is doing better than expected - suggesting it is outpacing the rest of the eurozone. British retail sales have declined at the fastest pace since the 2008 financial crisis, according to the latest healthcheck from the CBI. The CBI fears that confidence is \u2018crumbling\u2019, with retailers growing gloomier about future prospects. The pound has rallied after Angela Merkel denied setting the UK a 30-day deadline to solve the Irish border problem. Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain has threatened to stop stocking products with excessive packaging. Tesco CEO Dave Lewis also hopes to plug his business into a new national recycling network, to tackle the plastic crisis America\u2019s yield curve has inverted again \u2013 a sign that bond investors are concerned to hear that US factory output is shrinking. The yield on 10-year Treasuries is now 1.59%, compared to 1.6% for two-year Treasuries. Typically the longer-dated debt would trade at a higher yield, giving a better rate of return to make up for the risk of lending for longer. Some snap reaction to the news that America\u2019s manufacturing is now (just) shrinking. Here\u2019s the US PMI report (only a flash estimate, as we\u2019re still in August of course) Newsflash: America\u2019s factory sector is shrinking for the first time in almost a decade \u2013 a sign that the trade war with China may be hurting. Data firm Markit has just reported that its US manufacturing PMI has fallen to 44.9, down from 50.4 in July. This is the first time since September 2009 that this PMI has dropped below 50.0 \u2013 the point that separates expansion from contraction. US factory bosses reported that new business fell, only a little, but at the fastest rate in a decade. Exports also fell, at the fastest rate since August 2009. This is going to fuel concerns that the US economy is slowing. Markit also found that service sector growth also dipped, pulling the overall US Composite Output Index down to 50.9, a three-month low. Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, explains what it means: August\u2019s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter. The PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualized GDP growth of around 1.5%. The most concerning aspect of the latest data is a slowdown in new business growth to its weakest in a decade, driven by a sharp loss of momentum across the service sector. Survey respondents commented on a headwind from subdued corporate spending as softer growth expectations at home and internationally encouraged tighter budget setting. Manufacturing companies continued to feel the impact of slowing global economic conditions, with new export sales falling at the fastest pace since August 2009. Business expectations for the year ahead became more gloomy in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012. The continued slide in corporate growth projections suggests that firms may exert greater caution in relation to spending, investment and staff hiring during the coming months.\u201d The pound has just jumped, after Angela Merkel played down the suggestion she\u2019s set Britain a new 30-day deadline to solve Brexit. Yesterday, when meeting Boris Johnson, the chancellor said the conundrum of the Irish backstop could possibly be solved within 30 days. But speaking in the Netherlands today, Merkel denied this was a new, hard deadline of mid-September. She said her comments were was merely \u201can allegory for being able to do it in a short period of time\u201d. It would be better to say one can achieve that by October 31. This has pushed sterling up by a whole cent against the US dollar, to $1.225. I\u2019m not sure this is a major development, though. Brussels hasn\u2019t shifted from its position that a hard border in Ireland must be avoided. The backstop is an insurance plan against that -- Johnson needs to come up with a better idea quickly. Ding ding! The New York stock market has opened a little higher, as investors await news from the Jackson Hole central banking symposium tomorrow. Here\u2019s the opening prices: Dow: up 87 points or 0.35% at 26,290 points S&amp;P 500: up 8.68 points or 0.3% at 2,933 points Nasdaq: up 82 points or 0.27% at 8,042 points Barely a day goes by without Donald Trump undermining the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence... and he\u2019s just done it again. The president is still fuming that Germany sold over \u20ac800m of 30-year bunds at a negative interest rate on Wednesday (meaning investors won\u2019t get any return at all). This, Trump feels, is further evidence that US interest rates are too high and should be cut. But.. it\u2019s not clear that German\u2019s record low bond yields are a reason to celebrate. They reflect concern that Europe\u2019s economy is weak, with low growth and inflation, and the prospect of a new bond-buying programme from the ECB soon. Another retail survey has been released, which backs up the CBI\u2019s gloomy assessment of the sector. The latest IMRG Capgemini eRetail Sales Index shows that online spending fell by 5.7% in July, compared with June. This dragged the annual increase in web spending down to just 4.4% \u2013 much weaker than the 10% averaged over the last five years. This slowdown came despite the hot weather in July (which might have encouraged online purchases of summer clothes and kit), and Amazon\u2019s Prime Day \u2013 copied by many other retailers who offered their own sales. Andy Mulcahy, strategy and insight director, IMRG, said: Online sales growth had been subdued throughout the first half of 2019, but in June there seemed to be a bit of a bounce-back that hinted toward growth picking up again. However, there is now evidence that the June performance was artificially inflated by heavy discounting to stimulate sales activity, and it seems likely that some of that volume was pulled forward from July. In other retail news, supermarket chain Tesco has pledged to ban brands who use too much packaging, to help fight the plastics crisis. Dave Lewis, the boss of Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket, has decided that Tesco could \u201creserve the right not to list\u201d products with too much non-recyclable packaging from next year onwards. Writing on the Guardian website, he points out that some suppliers are simply using too much packaging for their wares: We have all looked at the settled contents of a cereal packet and puzzled over the comparative size of the bag and box. Or opened a bag of crisps and wondered why the packaging is twice the size of the contents. This has to stop, Lewis says: We\u2019re setting ourselves and our suppliers a challenge. The need is urgent, and so from next year we will assess the size and suitability of all packaging as part of our ranging decisions, and if it\u2019s excessive or inappropriate, we reserve the right not to list the product Lewis says Tesco is already cleaning up its own act, removing non-recyclable packaging and trialling various measure to cut waste. Not before time - the company has been criticised before for using too much plastic and cardboard. But ultimately, it needs government action: We need a standardised national collection and a truly complete and national recycling infrastructure. Today, recycling rates vary across local authorities from 65% to 14%. Without a national infrastructure, industry efforts to improve the recyclability of materials used in packaging will not have the impact we need. Howard Archer of EY Item Club reckons the CBI is certainly on to something: A word of caution. The CBI\u2019s retail sales survey is much gloomier than recent official retail spending figures. Last week, the Office for National Statistics reported that retail sales grew by 3.3% year-on-year in July, and by 1% month-on-month (they\u2019ve not released August\u2019s numbers yet). In contrast, the CBI reported last month that sales had fallen in July, and sharply in June \u2013 a glum assessment backed up by this morning\u2019s alarming report for August. So why the discrepancy? No survey paints a truly accurate picture, of course (unless you took data from literally every company and individual, I guess). Last week, the CBI\u2019s principal economist, Alpesh Paleja, showed the size of the gap: He\u2019s not lost faith in his own data, arguing that it may give a better picture: The CBI is tweeting the key points from their retail sales survey: The threat of a no-deal Brexit is helping to keep shoppers off the high street, warns Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist. She says: Sentiment is crumbling among retailers, and unexpectedly weak sales have led to a large overhang of stocks. With investment intentions for the year ahead and employment down, retailers expect a chilly few months ahead. \u201cIt is unsurprising that business confidence has deteriorated sharply, with a potential no-deal Brexit on the horizon. But retailers are also buckling under the cumulative burden of costs, including an outdated business rates system and the apprenticeship levy. Businesses will be looking for government action at the Budget in the coming months to alleviate some of these pressures.\u201d NEWSFLASH: Confidence among UK retailers is \u2018crumbling\u2019, as shops suffer the sharpest fall in sales and new orders since the financial crisis. The CBI\u2019s latest survey of the retail sector, just released, also shows that optimism about upcoming sales has also hit its lowest level in over a decade. Just 10% of the firms surveyed said that sales volumes this month are higher than in August 2018, while 58% said they were lower. That gave a net balance of -49% -- the worst reading since 2008. Such a weak reading suggests consumer confidence and spending is deteriorating, with Britain\u2019s economy having already shrunk in the second quarter of 2019. The survey also showed that retailers are cutting back on new orders, as they brace for tough times ahead. The CBI says: Retailers expect sales volumes to fall at a slower pace next month (-10%), with 14% expecting a rise and 24% expecting a fall Sales were seen as slightly below average for the time of year, but to a lesser degree than last month, with 15% saying they were good, 54% saying they were average and 21% saying they were poor. This gave a rounded balance of -6%. Orders placed upon suppliers fell at the quickest rate since December 2008, with 10% of survey respondents reporting an increase and 67% reporting a fall, giving a balance of -57%. Orders are expected to fall again in September, albeit at a slower pace (-29%) 2% of respondents expect the business situation to improve over the next three months, with 27% expecting a deterioration, giving a rounded balance of -25%. 16% of retailers intended to invest more over the next 12 months compared to the previous 12 months, whilst 35% expect to invest less, giving a balance of -19%. Average selling prices compared to a year ago picked up somewhat (+67%), but are expected to grow more slowly next month (+35%) More to follow!! European stock markets are looking a bit directionless today. The FTSE 100 has shed 37 points, or 0.5%. Some investors fear the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates as rapidly as thought, as the minutes of July\u2019s meeting (released last night) showed a big split (see earlier post). The German DAX is down 0.3%, with some relief that this morning\u2019s PMI survey wasn\u2019t worse. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is bucking the trend, though, up 0.3% on hopes that a new coalition government will be agreed soon. The plunge in the pound since the Brexit vote has made UK assets more attractive to overseas buyers. And this morning, shares in healthcare group NMC Health have soared by over 25% due to talk of a takeover bid. According to Reuters, two groups are vying to buy a significantly sized stake in NMC, which is based in the UAE but listed in London (and currently top of the FTSE 100 risers). One of the two bidders is backed by Fosun, the Chinese media conglomerate. Back on Monday, Hong Kong billionaire Victor Li took advantage of sterling\u2019s weakness with an unexpected takeover of pub chain Greene King. NMC also posted strong results this morning too, with revenues up 32% and net profits rising 30%. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, The global healthcare industry has many supporting factors including rising populations and ageing societies and well as higher incomes and propensities to spend on healthcare and this is no different in the Middle East. Today\u2019s PMI reports are hardly sparkling \u2013 they show that the eurozone economy is staggering along this month, with only modest growth. But, they\u2019re also better than hoped \u2013 not to be sniffed at in the current climate. Rupert Thompson, head of research at Kingswood, says this is welcome good news: The Eurozone PMI data in August were not as weak as had been expected, providing a rare bit of good news on the Eurozone economy. Business confidence unexpectedly recovered a little, both in the Eurozone and also Germany which has led the slowdown in recent months. Even so, business confidence remains low and growth weak and the ECB still looks all but certain to cut rates next month. A re-starting of its quantitative easing programme is also quite possible.\u201d Bert Colijn, economist at ING agrees, telling clients: Small wins should be celebrated. A small uptick in eurozone\u2019s August PMIs from 51.5 to 51.8 is somewhat a relief today as analysts had expected a further slide. If nothing else, at least it indicates that the economy is unlikely to have slipped into negative growth halfway through the third quarter . The picture remains more or less unchanged, with slow growth thanks to a sluggish manufacturing sector and service sector strength that keeps the economy growing. But Morten Lund of Nordea Markets sees trouble ahead: Today\u2019s PMI report provides plenty of reasons to worry about Germany\u2019s economy. It shows that: New orders fell at their fastest rate since April 2013 Company bosses are their most pessimistic in five years Factory output shrank for the eighth month in a row Employment growth was the weakest since 2014 No wonder Markit fears Germany\u2019s economy is still shrinking, following a 0.1% contraction in April-June. Lena Komilieva of G+ Economics isn\u2019t impressed: The euro has risen against other major currencies following today\u2019s PMI surveys. Germany\u2019s stock market has also received a small lift - but only up 0.1% on the day. Newsflash: European company growth has picked up this month, but remains rather subdued. Markit\u2019s overall eurozone composite PMI, just released, has risen to 51.8, from 51.5 in July. That level implies weak growth \u2013 but slightly better than a month ago. Markit says the ongoing contraction across European factories (excluding France, as we\u2019ve just learned) is dragging the economy back. The recent soft patch in the eurozone economy continued into August, according to latest PMI data from IHS Markit, with activity rising modestly amid a marginal increase in new business. The recent pattern of services growth compensating for a downturn in manufacturing was repeated midway through the third quarter. August did see a drop off in confidence among companies in the single currency area, with firms becoming more wary of hiring additional staff as a result. This PMI is slightly better than expected \u2013 which could calm eurozone recession worries. Aila Mihr of Danske also fears Germany could be sliding into recession: Germany is still at risk of falling into recession this autumn, says Markit\u2019s Phil Smith, based on today\u2019s PMI survey. He\u2019s concerned that \u2018cracks\u2019 are appearing in its service sector, with new order growth very weak and business confidence at a near five-year low. Smith says: Germany remains a two-speed economy, with ongoing growth of services just about compensating for the sustained weakness in manufacturing. Although improving slightly, the survey\u2019s output data haven\u2019t changed enough to dispel the threat of another slight contraction in GDP in the third quarter, especially given the deterioration in the forward-looking indicators ... The sustained weakness in demand continues to filter through to the jobs market. Employment growth has now almost stalled, reflecting falling capacity pressures and lower business Worryingly, German business confidence fell this month. Markit says that a majority of firms surveyed in today\u2019s PMI report are now gloomy: For the first time in almost five years, the number of firms expecting output to fall over the next 12 months exceeded those predicting a rise, with sentiment the most negative overall since November 2012. Just in: Germany\u2019s economy is continuing to \u201cunderperform\u201d this month. Markit\u2019s new PMI survey shows that German factory sector is still shrinking, although at a slower pace, while the service sector continued to cool. Markit says: The German economy continued to underperform in August, latest flash PMI data showed. Growth of service sector business activity was again countered by a marked fall in goods production, while overall job creation slipped to a five-year low. Worryingly for the outlook, total new orders sank deeper into contraction territory and firms\u2019 expectations towards future output turned negative for the first time since late 2014. Here\u2019s the details: Flash German composite PMI rose to 51.4, from 50.9 in July, showing modest growth. Germany Services PMI dipped to 54.4, from 54.5, a seven-month low. Germany Manufacturing PMI rose to 43.6, from 43.2 - that\u2019s a 2-month high, but still means factories are shrinking Traders and economists are impressed by today\u2019s French PMI report. Here\u2019s Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Asset Management: And here\u2019s Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: Joshua Mahony of IG tweets: Eliot Kerr, economist at IHS Markit, says France appears to be outperforming some of its eurozone neighbours. French private sector businesses posted another solid increase in output during August. Service sector expansion continued to surpass manufacturing growth, reflecting the broader trend seen across the eurozone in recent months. However, in contrast to its peers, economic growth in France has remained solid and the latest set of PMI figures only add weight to the argument that this outperformance is likely to continue in the third quarter.\u201d Here\u2019s the details of today\u2019s PMI report: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. France\u2019s economy is picking up speed this month, boosting hopes that a eurozone recession could be avoided. A new healthcheck on the French private sector, just released, shows that private sector growth accelerated in August. The monthly \u2018flash\u2019 PMIs, from data firm Markit, show that French services sector firms grew at their fastest rate in nine months. Factories returned to growth, after suffering a contraction in July. This lifted the overall French purchasing managers index to 52.7 in August from 51.9 in July. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this suggests the French economy is picking up. French companies reported a jump in orders this month, including export orders. That could show a pick-up in the global economy, after some tough months. We\u2019ll find out shortly how Germany is faring, along with the rest of the eurozone.... Also coming up today Central bankers are heading to Wyoming, for the annual Jackson Hole Symposium. This year\u2019s meeting is overshadowed by concerns over the global economy, and speculation that America could drop into recession in 2020. Financial markets will be looking for hints that US interest rates could be cut soon, with Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell speaking on Friday Yesterday, Donald Trump launched his most personal attack yet on Powell\u2019s competence, comparing him to a golfer who can\u2019t putt and raging that US borrowing costs are unfairly high. Powell surely can\u2019t enjoy the tirade of criticism flowing towards the Fed from the White House; investors are wondering whether he will cave into the pressure and slash rates aggressively. The Fed has already cut rates in July, of course. But the minutes of that meeting, released last night, showed that policymakers were split. Most supported the 25 basis-point reduction, but a couple wanted a bigger cut and some wanted to leave rates unchanged. That suggests there will be some big arguments within the Fed about what to do next..... Traders will also be watching Rome, where the Italian president is leading efforts to form a new government, and Paris, where Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron will be discussing Brexit.

      "bodyText": "EUROPEAN FOOTBALL NONSENSE Wolves play the first leg of their Euro Vase play-off against Torino this evening. If they win the tie they\u2019ll just have to win a bingo tournament, recite the alphabet backwards for the amusement of a couple of Uefa suits and profess their undying love for West Brom to ensure their place in next week\u2019s group stage draw. Then they\u2019ll only be a mere 427 matches away from reaching next summer\u2019s final in Gdansk. European glory beckons! Not that the Fiver\u2019s stereotypical English cousin, $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver, sees what all the fuss is about. It\u2019s been banging on about the handball law again. Reckons the EU\u2019s up to no good. Doesn\u2019t see why English teams should bother with all that European football nonsense. Doesn\u2019t remember voting for Wolves to be in Euro Vase anyway. Bloody foreigners. Wolves are pressing on, though, and there\u2019s a whiff of skullduggery afoot. Bear with us here. See, it turns out that tonight\u2019s referee is Portuguese. And get this: the Wolves manager is \u2026 also Portuguese. Yes! Honest! It\u2019s really happened. For the first time in the history of the game, the referee is going to be from the same country as one team\u2019s manager. Who let this one through? Probably those EU idiots. Mind you, Wolves manager Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo reckons being able to speak the same language as the man with the whistle, Artur Dias, will make no difference at all. But then he would, wouldn\u2019t he? \u201cThere\u2019s no issue here, come on,\u201d Nuno said. \u201cOur native language here is English, everyone speaks English to each other.\u201d The Fiver supposes that Nuno has bigger things to worry about: Torino finished seventh in Serie A last season and are no mugs. Their domestic campaign hasn\u2019t started yet, but they\u2019ve looked good in Europe so far, thumping Debrecen and Shakhtyor Soligorsk, and Wolves will need to pay close attention to Andrea Belotti up front. The Italy striker already has four goals in four games and has long been targeted by bigger clubs. But perhaps there\u2019s a sneaky way forward for Wolves. Defend deep in both legs, play for two 0-0 draws and wait for penalties. Belotti can\u2019t take them all, can he? One of them will have to fall to his strike partner, Simone Zaza. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Nick Ames for hot clockwatch coverage of Torino 1-1 Wolves, Legia Warsaw 2-0 Rangers, Celtic 1-0 AIK and all the other Euro Vase action from 7pm. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cVinnie loves the club so much that he always wants to give everything for Anderlecht. Every day. But now on competition days he will only concentrate on his match\u201d \u2013 Anderlecht assistant Simon Davies explains why Vincent Kompany, who has overseen the club\u2019s worst start to a season in 21 years, will no longer take matchday managerial duties with the club.

Near the end of the 2018 season, Juan Manuel Lillo was appointed as head coach, with much made of the Spaniard\u2019s label as Pep Guardiola\u2019s mentor, but six months later he was gone.</p> <p>Lillo may not have been regarded as the last piece of the jigsaw but this master strategist was supposed to make the big picture visible. The target of the top three in 2018 had been missed before he took over and the season ended with Kobe in 10th. To jump from mid-table in 2018 to top in 2019 (the target set two years earlier) was always going to be a long shot but Kobe were expected to at least mount a challenge.</p> <p>The arrival of Lillo suggested that the Rakuten founder and Kobe chairman, Hiroshi Mikitani, understood that it was going to take time to achieve his goal. To become another Barcelona was not going to happen just by signing a few former players but through building a philosophy over a number of years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa27c189c081465efbe8c82d5f02804dee0df797\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa27c189c081465efbe8c82d5f02804dee0df797/0_76_3189_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lukas Podolski stepped down as Vissel Kobe captain last April and will not go down as one of the club\u2019s better signings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lukas Podolski stepped down as Vissel Kobe captain last April and will not go down as one of the club\u2019s better signings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Etsuo Hara/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lillo\u2019s exit last April suggested, however, that Kobe had serious issues. He stepped down after seven league games of the season and an underwhelming but hardly disastrous haul of 10 points. Lillo said that it was the best move for his family but the job already appeared to be an impossible one. He did not have the time to build a Bar\u00e7a style of play but he had more than enough to understand that it was never going to happen.</p> <p>The next day, Podolski stepped down as captain and tweeted: \u201cStop expecting loyalty from people who can\u2019t even give you honesty.\u201d It was unclear as to whether this was aimed at teammates, Lillo or the club. The German, who impressed so much on his debut, will not go down as one of Kobe\u2019s better signings and will be remembered more for his remonstrations with referees and colleagues than anything special on the pitch.</p> <p>Iniesta, who took the armband relinquished by Podolski, has performed better, seemingly enjoying his time in Japan. The class and the passes are still there, with even those that are misplaced often having more to do with teammates not making the right runs. Although the midfielder still misses games here and there for reasons often not given, in different circumstances Iniesta would be driving Kobe to the title. While Podolski bemoans the lack of stability on the pitch, it merely mirrors the situation off it.</p> <p>Days after Lillo was out, Makitani was announcing a July friendly against, unsurprisingly, Barcelona. \u201cAs you know, the world is paying attention to this match,\u201d the chairman told a Tokyo press conference in which he declined to talk about the issues at Kobe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe his reticence was understandable as few were excited by Lillo\u2019s successor. Takayuki Yoshida had been sacked from the same job in September 2018 but was given a chance to show that he had acquired major skills in the seven months since. He lasted seven weeks. This time he was replaced by Thorsten Fink. The former Hamburg and Grasshoppers coach is a move to a more pragmatic style but results have yet to improve.</p> <p>On Friday the German takes his team to Sagan Tosu, who have the misfiring Fernando Torres in attack, for a six-pointer. Defeat would see the star-studded side slip below the hosts into 16th and the relegation play-off spot. There is not much talk of Barcelona these days. For Vissel Kobe, a club that was supposed to be the number one in Asia, the focus is now on avoiding the drop to the number two league in Japan.</p>",

The target of the top three in 2018 had been missed before he took over and the season ended with Kobe in 10th. To jump from mid-table in 2018 to top in 2019 (the target set two years earlier) was always going to be a long shot but Kobe were expected to at least mount a challenge. The arrival of Lillo suggested that the Rakuten founder and Kobe chairman, Hiroshi Mikitani, understood that it was going to take time to achieve his goal. To become another Barcelona was not going to happen just by signing a few former players but through building a philosophy over a number of years. Lillo\u2019s exit last April suggested, however, that Kobe had serious issues. He stepped down after seven league games of the season and an underwhelming but hardly disastrous haul of 10 points. Lillo said that it was the best move for his family but the job already appeared to be an impossible one. He did not have the time to build a Bar\u00e7a style of play but he had more than enough to understand that it was never going to happen. The next day, Podolski stepped down as captain and tweeted: \u201cStop expecting loyalty from people who can\u2019t even give you honesty.\u201d It was unclear as to whether this was aimed at teammates, Lillo or the club. The German, who impressed so much on his debut, will not go down as one of Kobe\u2019s better signings and will be remembered more for his remonstrations with referees and colleagues than anything special on the pitch. Iniesta, who took the armband relinquished by Podolski, has performed better, seemingly enjoying his time in Japan. The class and the passes are still there, with even those that are misplaced often having more to do with teammates not making the right runs. Although the midfielder still misses games here and there for reasons often not given, in different circumstances Iniesta would be driving Kobe to the title. While Podolski bemoans the lack of stability on the pitch, it merely mirrors the situation off it. Days after Lillo was out, Makitani was announcing a July friendly against, unsurprisingly, Barcelona. \u201cAs you know, the world is paying attention to this match,\u201d the chairman told a Tokyo press conference in which he declined to talk about the issues at Kobe. Maybe his reticence was understandable as few were excited by Lillo\u2019s successor. Takayuki Yoshida had been sacked from the same job in September 2018 but was given a chance to show that he had acquired major skills in the seven months since. He lasted seven weeks. This time he was replaced by Thorsten Fink. The former Hamburg and Grasshoppers coach is a move to a more pragmatic style but results have yet to improve. On Friday the German takes his team to Sagan Tosu, who have the misfiring Fernando Torres in attack, for a six-pointer. Defeat would see the star-studded side slip below the hosts into 16th and the relegation play-off spot. There is not much talk of Barcelona these days. For Vissel Kobe, a club that was supposed to be the number one in Asia, the focus is now on avoiding the drop to the number two league in Japan.",

This means someone Swift despises can now do exactly what he wants with her recordings: if he wanted to license them to porn films or adverts for weapons of mass destruction, he probably could. Swift\u2019s new deal with Republic gives her ownership of her master recordings, so anything she records for them, she has ownership of (and a much greater share of the revenue from).</p> <p>Still, while the terms of Swift\u2019s deal with Republic weren\u2019t made public \u2013 Universal announced only that it was <a href=\"https://www.universalmusic.com/taylor-swift-signs-exclusive-global-recording-agreement-universal-music-group/\">\u201ca multi-album agreement\u201d</a> \u2013 it would be surprising if the label would allow its marquee artist to devote her time with them to rerecording old music rather than giving them new albums. But, still, let\u2019s assume it\u2019s going to happen anyway.</p> <p>Artists have rerecorded their music before, for similar reasons \u2013 when they were unhappy with whichever label owned their masters. As part of a long-running dispute with Universal over digital royalty rates, in 2012 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/defleppard\">Def Leppard</a> forbade the company from using its own music for anything other than physical product, and began recording \u201cforgeries\u201d of their old hits \u2013 from which they would take 70% of the revenue \u2013 for use on download and streaming services.</p> <p>Two years before that, Squeeze also released re-recordings of their old songs as the album Spot the Difference, hoping these new versions would be used in adverts and films, rather than the originals, which were owned by \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Universal. \u201cThe fact we do not (and never will) own the recordings of some of our best work is simply not fair,\u201d Glenn Tilbrook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/oct/25/squeeze-back-catalogue-up-junction\">wrote at the time</a>. At a lesser level, Greg Kihn recorded new versions of old hits in 2000, again to gain the financial benefits when they were licensed for other uses, and again to stop Universal reaping all the rewards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d1ce7ccdaf20a1aaefa43cfe44d862e7ab151c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d1ce7ccdaf20a1aaefa43cfe44d862e7ab151c5/481_287_3019_1811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Elliott of Def Leppard at rhe O2 Arena, 6 December 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donning the battle armour \u2026 Def Leppard\u2019s Joe Elliott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Hale/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Swift\u2019s case seems to be closest to that of Def Leppard. Both are superstar acts who were financial mainstays for their respective labels. And in both cases, one might detect a certain spirit of vengeance. Def Leppard\u2019s Joe Elliott also took the view that his band had built their label in the first place, and deserved more respect. \u201cWe bought that building in the 80s, and they treat us like shit,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/def-leppard-universal-recording-hits-356397\">he said</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve become irrelevant to the label, so we\u2019re putting on the battle armour.\u201d</p> <p>While Swift almost certainly does not need the money from licensing new versions of Shake It Off or I Knew You Were Trouble, her dislike of Braun appears to be so great that she would do almost anything to prevent him benefitting from the originals. And she has an unusual degree of power within the music industry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/12/justin-bieber-manager-scooter-braun-ariana-grande-kanye-west\">Pop super-manager Scooter Braun: 'I was not going to let Justin Bieber die'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She\u2019s also counting on her loyal fans to follow her. And, doubtless, some will. But will everyone? Because a song is more than just a collection of notes and words; it is also a moment captured in time. And new versions of old songs, however perfect they might be in their re-creation, are different moments. An old song is like a favourite pair of jeans; you know how the song fits you. Much as I like Def Leppard, for example, I didn\u2019t bother going to their \u201cforgeries\u201d when they were the only official versions online. If I wanted to hear them on a computer, I just went over to YouTube. Swift released her debut album when she was 16, and she sounds like a 16-year-old on those songs; if a 29-year-old Swift were to re-record it note-for-note, she couldn\u2019t recapture the girlish quality that gave her debut its charm.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s not what she\u2019s planning. Perhaps she\u2019s going to shun like-for-like re-creations and reinvent those old albums. That would be interesting, though likely still just a curio. But I don\u2019t think so. It wouldn\u2019t have any great impact on Braun for one thing. In fact, I suspect this project will never reach completion. Swift may well be driven by a supreme sense of self and desire to control her destiny, but those very characteristics will surely prevent her dedicating so much time to something that will only hold her back. Her last few years have been dedicated to progress; why start moving backwards?</p>",

Still, while the terms of Swift\u2019s deal with Republic weren\u2019t made public \u2013 Universal announced only that it was \u201ca multi-album agreement\u201d \u2013 it would be surprising if the label would allow its marquee artist to devote her time with them to rerecording old music rather than giving them new albums. But, still, let\u2019s assume it\u2019s going to happen anyway. Artists have rerecorded their music before, for similar reasons \u2013 when they were unhappy with whichever label owned their masters. As part of a long-running dispute with Universal over digital royalty rates, in 2012 Def Leppard forbade the company from using its own music for anything other than physical product, and began recording \u201cforgeries\u201d of their old hits \u2013 from which they would take 70% of the revenue \u2013 for use on download and streaming services. Two years before that, Squeeze also released re-recordings of their old songs as the album Spot the Difference, hoping these new versions would be used in adverts and films, rather than the originals, which were owned by \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Universal. \u201cThe fact we do not (and never will) own the recordings of some of our best work is simply not fair,\u201d Glenn Tilbrook wrote at the time. At a lesser level, Greg Kihn recorded new versions of old hits in 2000, again to gain the financial benefits when they were licensed for other uses, and again to stop Universal reaping all the rewards. Swift\u2019s case seems to be closest to that of Def Leppard. Both are superstar acts who were financial mainstays for their respective labels. And in both cases, one might detect a certain spirit of vengeance. Def Leppard\u2019s Joe Elliott also took the view that his band had built their label in the first place, and deserved more respect. \u201cWe bought that building in the 80s, and they treat us like shit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become irrelevant to the label, so we\u2019re putting on the battle armour.\u201d While Swift almost certainly does not need the money from licensing new versions of Shake It Off or I Knew You Were Trouble, her dislike of Braun appears to be so great that she would do almost anything to prevent him benefitting from the originals. And she has an unusual degree of power within the music industry. She\u2019s also counting on her loyal fans to follow her. And, doubtless, some will. But will everyone? Because a song is more than just a collection of notes and words; it is also a moment captured in time. And new versions of old songs, however perfect they might be in their re-creation, are different moments. An old song is like a favourite pair of jeans; you know how the song fits you. Much as I like Def Leppard, for example, I didn\u2019t bother going to their \u201cforgeries\u201d when they were the only official versions online. If I wanted to hear them on a computer, I just went over to YouTube. Swift released her debut album when she was 16, and she sounds like a 16-year-old on those songs; if a 29-year-old Swift were to re-record it note-for-note, she couldn\u2019t recapture the girlish quality that gave her debut its charm. Maybe that\u2019s not what she\u2019s planning. Perhaps she\u2019s going to shun like-for-like re-creations and reinvent those old albums. That would be interesting, though likely still just a curio. But I don\u2019t think so. It wouldn\u2019t have any great impact on Braun for one thing. In fact, I suspect this project will never reach completion. Swift may well be driven by a supreme sense of self and desire to control her destiny, but those very characteristics will surely prevent her dedicating so much time to something that will only hold her back. Her last few years have been dedicated to progress; why start moving backwards?",

When she stepped out at the Culture Clash soundclash at London\u2019s O2 Arena in 2016, it was into the chaos of balloons, airhorns and baying ravers. She strode to the front of the stage, demanded a rewind from the DJ and silence from the crowd, then jump-dropped into the splits, calling on the rival team leader Wiz Khalifa, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/20/is-eating-bananas-whole-gay-fragile-masculinitys-bizarre-new-hetiquette\" title=\"\">posterboy for fragile masculinity</a> (who is scared to eat a whole banana in public, for fear of looking gay) to \u201ceat mi pum pum\u201d. The crowd went insane. Her crew Mixpak (featuring Popcaan and Jubilee) were the bookie\u2019s underdogs, but walked away with that year\u2019s trophy.</p> \n<p>Spice \u2013 Grace Hamilton when she\u2019s off duty \u2013 grew up in Portmore, near Kingston, and wasn\u2019t always destined for dancehall greatness. She was the middle child of five siblings and came from what she calls \u201chumble beginnings\u201d. Her childhood years were dedicated to Sunday school and choir. It wasn\u2019t until she started high school that she discovered the dancehall sound and realised that she could use her well-trained pipes for less godly lyrical content.</p> \n<p>At just 15, Spice was introduced to Junior \u201cHeavy D\u201d Fraser, the organiser of Sting \u2013 an annual Boxing Day coming-together of dancehall\u2019s major players. He was impressed by her talent and invited her to perform. \u201cA Sting audience will boo you and throw bottles at you,\u201d Spice laughs as we chat on the phone while she is driven through her homeland\u2019s hills. \u201cWhen you can conquer that crowd in Jamaica, you can conquer anywhere in the world.\u201d Her performing debut saw her called back to the stage for numerous encores.

Spice now boasts a run of accolades including female DJ of the year at Jamaica\u2019s International Reggae and World Music awards for 10 years running; first to top 1 million followers on Instagram; 87m YouTube views for her 2014 hit So Mi Like It; and, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=Ok7D3qHakLQ\" title=\"\">Romping Shop</a>, the first Jamaican collaboration to hit the US billboard charts with her long-time creative ally Vybz Kartel. Clearly, Bounty Killer called it right.</p> \n<p>And yet, she has nowhere near the global recognition of her male peers including Vybz or Popcaan. Dancehall has echoed hip-hop\u2019s tiresome rhetoric that there\u2019s only room for one woman at the top. \u201cI explain all the time that there\u2019s room for all of us,\u201d says Spice. \u201cI can be performing in Canada tonight and another woman can be performing in England on the same night, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re getting it.\u201d Right back to the days of Sister Nancy, women have struggled to become household names in a scene where the ultimate benchmark is often \u201cup there with the men\u201d.</p> \n<p>But Spice is determined to do whatever it takes to get that recognition. She arrived at the launch of her single Conjugal Visit with a Vybz Kartel lookalike as a prank, briefly making people believe that her co-star on the track \u2013 sentenced to life in jail in 2014 for murder \u2013 had broken out for the party. Her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/spiceofficial/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> is a daily updated riot of hyper-colour maximalism; she is worth following for her Chanel-branded birthday pancakes alone. At the 2017 Notting Hill carnival she called a young white man to the stage, demanded he lie on the floor and then hurled herself from a 10ft speaker stack, legs split, daggering right into his crotch.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a3ccf7fc2ea38b4b09bf4939e9d5a8ac19e3a2fd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3ccf7fc2ea38b4b09bf4939e9d5a8ac19e3a2fd/21_37_4443_2839/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spice\u2019s stunt at the 2017 NottingHill carnival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spice\u2019s stunt at the 2017 Notting Hill carnival.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Her most recent and high-profile visual stunt offered further insight into why superstardom may have thus far evaded her.

Proudly ambitious, she wants nothing to distract from her goal to see authentic dancehall recognised and respected globally.</p> \n<p>Last year, in an attempt to cross over in the US, she joined the cast of the merciless reality TV franchise Love &amp; Hip Hop: Atlanta. The show was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNN/status/794626928263200768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E794626928263200768&amp;ref_url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/11/obama-this-election-is-love-hip-hop-stuff.html\" title=\"\">once namechecked by Barack Obama</a> to illustrate just how dirty the 2016 election campaign had become. However, even by those standards, Spice had a tough ride. She has been mocked for her accent, her music and her videos. One cast mate told her: \u201cYou flew here, I grew here.\u201d Another demonstrated a wilful lack of understanding of the DIY nature of dancehall: \u201cEvery last video I\u2019ve seen from you is horrible, honey.\u201d This is happening within hip-hop, a scene that has been obsessed with Jamaican culture of late: patois dabbling and verses by reggae guests littering recent tracks by the likes of Drake and DJ Khaled. But just as Spice has felt pressure to subdue her blackness, the subtext is that she might go further if she also toned down her Jamaican-ness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dec5de8a0b19aa994ed5b30e85217471ad6be038\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dec5de8a0b19aa994ed5b30e85217471ad6be038/0_366_6322_3794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Performing at the Culture Clash soundclash at the O2 Arena, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing at the Culture Clash soundclash at the O2 Arena, 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicky J Sims/Getty Images for Red Bull</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Spice plays by her own rules. She had a long-running feud with her label, VP Records, which signed her a decade ago, but still hasn\u2019t let her release her debut album. So she self-released her mixtape, Captured, last November. Essentially her debut, it reached No 1 on the Billboard reggae album chart. But it\u2019s still rare to hear her on primetime radio outside of Jamaica. And so, her ability to work a crowd has come to characterise her career. I speak to Mixpak\u2019s DJ Jubilee about what makes Spice special. \u201cShe\u2019s an unforgettable performer,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen she played in Brooklyn, the first 10 rows in the crowd were women screaming like it was a Justin Bieber concert.\u201d</p> \n<p>Perhaps sexually explicit lyrical content from the mouth of a dark-skinned woman has made radio programmers nervous. But asking a dancehall artist not to sing about sex is a bit like asking a balladeer not to sing about love. As Spice explains, slackness \u2013 the shame-free celebration of all things X-rated \u2013 is intrinsic to the genre. And to say that Spice is sex-positive would be an understatement. \u201cAs everybody knows, sex sells,\u201d Spice laughs. \u201cThe most famous line in So Mi Like It is: \u2018Skin out mi pum pum.\u2019 So I know for a fact that\u2019s what mi audience like.\u201d</p> \n<p>If we go by the logic that sex is dancing horizontally, then it follows that Spice\u2019s tracks are dancefloor perfection. \u201cWhen you hear mi songs, try not to whine!\u201d she screams. Live, Spice and her female dancers tear up the stage with don\u2019t-try-this-at-home back bends, twerks and gyrations. Gabriel, from UK dancehall soundsystem the Heatwave, says: \u201cIn an era where a lot of dancehall is aimed at radio and streaming audiences, Spice has focused on making songs for people to dance to. When I ask the dancers I work with what they want me to play at a show, often they\u2019ll simply say: \u2018Any Spice tune.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Spice bubbles with excitement when we discuss her forthcoming performance at Notting Hill carnival. England holds a special place in her heart thanks to a brief childhood stint living in Finsbury Park in London. Plus, there is a sense that she craves those moments when she can be celebrated for an undiluted version of her blackness: \u201cWhen I see other people coming out and loving and embracing the Caribbean culture, it\u2019s a good feeling for me.\u201d And she\u2019ll surely have something up her sleeve for the show; at her recent birthday party \u2013 fittingly, the queen of dancehall was born on Jamaican independence day \u2013 winners of a competition to dance to her single Cool It Down lumbered off stage with air-conditioning units as prizes.</p> \n<p>Does Spice believe that she would be bigger now if she had actually lightened her skin? \u201cIt\u2019s hard and it\u2019s sad, but yes, I do believe that it would have made it easier,\u201d she says, briefly despondent and then defiant. \u201cBut one way or another, people are going to respect Jamaican music, they\u2019re going to respect my culture. And I\u2019m going to do it without changing. I will take the difficult road.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Spice plays Notting Hill carnival\u2019s Red Bull Soundsystem at Emslie Horniman\u2019s Pleasance on 25</em><em> August</em></p>",

The show was once namechecked by Barack Obama to illustrate just how dirty the 2016 election campaign had become. However, even by those standards, Spice had a tough ride. She has been mocked for her accent, her music and her videos. One cast mate told her: \u201cYou flew here, I grew here.\u201d Another demonstrated a wilful lack of understanding of the DIY nature of dancehall: \u201cEvery last video I\u2019ve seen from you is horrible, honey.\u201d This is happening within hip-hop, a scene that has been obsessed with Jamaican culture of late: patois dabbling and verses by reggae guests littering recent tracks by the likes of Drake and DJ Khaled. But just as Spice has felt pressure to subdue her blackness, the subtext is that she might go further if she also toned down her Jamaican-ness. Spice plays by her own rules. She had a long-running feud with her label, VP Records, which signed her a decade ago, but still hasn\u2019t let her release her debut album. So she self-released her mixtape, Captured, last November. Essentially her debut, it reached No 1 on the Billboard reggae album chart. But it\u2019s still rare to hear her on primetime radio outside of Jamaica. And so, her ability to work a crowd has come to characterise her career. I speak to Mixpak\u2019s DJ Jubilee about what makes Spice special. \u201cShe\u2019s an unforgettable performer,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen she played in Brooklyn, the first 10 rows in the crowd were women screaming like it was a Justin Bieber concert.\u201d Perhaps sexually explicit lyrical content from the mouth of a dark-skinned woman has made radio programmers nervous. But asking a dancehall artist not to sing about sex is a bit like asking a balladeer not to sing about love. As Spice explains, slackness \u2013 the shame-free celebration of all things X-rated \u2013 is intrinsic to the genre. And to say that Spice is sex-positive would be an understatement. \u201cAs everybody knows, sex sells,\u201d Spice laughs. \u201cThe most famous line in So Mi Like It is: \u2018Skin out mi pum pum.\u2019 So I know for a fact that\u2019s what mi audience like.\u201d If we go by the logic that sex is dancing horizontally, then it follows that Spice\u2019s tracks are dancefloor perfection. \u201cWhen you hear mi songs, try not to whine!\u201d she screams. Live, Spice and her female dancers tear up the stage with don\u2019t-try-this-at-home back bends, twerks and gyrations. Gabriel, from UK dancehall soundsystem the Heatwave, says: \u201cIn an era where a lot of dancehall is aimed at radio and streaming audiences, Spice has focused on making songs for people to dance to. When I ask the dancers I work with what they want me to play at a show, often they\u2019ll simply say: \u2018Any Spice tune.\u2019\u201d Spice bubbles with excitement when we discuss her forthcoming performance at Notting Hill carnival. England holds a special place in her heart thanks to a brief childhood stint living in Finsbury Park in London. Plus, there is a sense that she craves those moments when she can be celebrated for an undiluted version of her blackness: \u201cWhen I see other people coming out and loving and embracing the Caribbean culture, it\u2019s a good feeling for me.\u201d And she\u2019ll surely have something up her sleeve for the show; at her recent birthday party \u2013 fittingly, the queen of dancehall was born on Jamaican independence day \u2013 winners of a competition to dance to her single Cool It Down lumbered off stage with air-conditioning units as prizes. Does Spice believe that she would be bigger now if she had actually lightened her skin? \u201cIt\u2019s hard and it\u2019s sad, but yes, I do believe that it would have made it easier,\u201d she says, briefly despondent and then defiant. \u201cBut one way or another, people are going to respect Jamaican music, they\u2019re going to respect my culture. And I\u2019m going to do it without changing. I will take the difficult road.\u201d Spice plays Notting Hill carnival\u2019s Red Bull Soundsystem at Emslie Horniman\u2019s Pleasance on 25 August",

This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.</p>\n    <p>Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.</p>\n    <p>The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.</p>\n    <p>Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u2019s customs union permanently if the UK &amp; EU cannot seal a free trade agreement.

It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p><b>Unilateral statement from the UK&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.</p>\n    <p><b>Additional language in political declaration&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson added that \u201ctechnical solutions\u201d were \u201creadily available\u201d to avoid checkpoints, but did not spell out his clear alternative to a backstop guarantee.</p> \n<p>The prime minister is due to meet the European council president, Donald Tusk, at the G7 summit this weekend, their first encounter since Johnson took over, an event that was greeted by a frosty two-line letter of congratulations from the EU leader.</p> \n<p>Tusk, who will be representing the EU at the G7, previously said there was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/donald-tusk-special-place-in-hell-for-those-who-backed-brexit-without-plan\">a special place in hell</a>\u201d for those who promoted Brexit \u201cwithout even a sketch of a plan\u201d \u2013 remarks seen as being aimed at Johnson, a figurehead of the leave campaign.</p> \n<p>Tusk will be \u201cin listening mode in Biarritz\u201d and the EU is \u201clooking forward to new facts and new workable ideas\u201d, a senior EU official said.

He said the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, could be involved in finding an answer \u201cwithout totally reshuffling the withdrawal agreement\u201d. \u201cWe should all together be able to find something smart within 30 days if there is goodwill on both sides,\u201d Macron said. \u201cWe need to try to have a useful month.\u201d Merkel insisted on Thursday that she had not given the UK a strict 30-day deadline, but instead wanted to highlight how short time was before the UK\u2019s planned exit date of 31 October. Any new proposals to deal with the issue of the Northern Ireland border should fit into the existing framework withdrawal agreement already negotiated, Macron said. Johnson has repeatedly said the backstop \u2013 an insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland \u2013 must go in order to avoid a no-deal exit. He argues it could leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. But Macron said the backstop was both an indispensable guarantee for the stability of Ireland and a means of protecting the integrity of the European single market, and that any new UK ideas had to respect that. Johnson arrived at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in a Range Rover decorated with UK flags. Macron is keenly aware of the prime minister\u2019s long track record of French-bashing for a domestic audience, but both men were at pains to show their close working relationship.

Macron appeared to have the upper hand as he smiled warmly while telling Johnson: \u201cOn Brexit my position is clear and I know how much that occupies your days and your nights.\u201d This appeared to be a reference to Downing Street rushing to respond on Wednesday night to Macron\u2019s comments to reporters in Paris that Johnson\u2019s written request to renegotiate the UK\u2019s exit and scrap the backstop was \u201cnot an option\u201d. Macron was even more tactile than usual with a foreign leader, repeatedly patting Johnson on the back and shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve always been portrayed as the toughest in the group,\u201d Macron grinned. Political commentators in France suspect Johnson of wanting to frame France as the bad cop to blame for any no deal. Macron is determined to avoid taking any blame for what he calls the UK\u2019s internal political crisis over Brexit. Macron said he believed the British people\u2019s sovereign decision must be carried out, warning against \u201cdemocracies suffering lack of efficiency and lack of clarity\u201d. He reminded Johnson that he stood firmly together with Merkel in a united position and that it was not up to any one single EU member state to negotiate. Johnson tried to strike a positive note, saying that he admired the \u201ccan-do spirit\u201d expressed by Merkel in Berlin on Wednesday. He said: \u201cLet\u2019s get Brexit done, let\u2019s get it done sensibly and pragmatically and in the interests of both sides and let\u2019s not wait until 31 October. Let\u2019s get on now in deepening and intensifying the friendship and partnership between us. \u201cWhen you look at the border with Northern Ireland ... under no circumstances will the UK government be instituting, imposing checks or controls of any kind at that border. We think there are ways of protecting the integrity of the single market and allowing the UK to exit from the EU, all and entire and perfect as it were.\u201d Johnson added that \u201ctechnical solutions\u201d were \u201creadily available\u201d to avoid checkpoints, but did not spell out his clear alternative to a backstop guarantee. The prime minister is due to meet the European council president, Donald Tusk, at the G7 summit this weekend, their first encounter since Johnson took over, an event that was greeted by a frosty two-line letter of congratulations from the EU leader. Tusk, who will be representing the EU at the G7, previously said there was \u201ca special place in hell\u201d for those who promoted Brexit \u201cwithout even a sketch of a plan\u201d \u2013 remarks seen as being aimed at Johnson, a figurehead of the leave campaign. Tusk will be \u201cin listening mode in Biarritz\u201d and the EU is \u201clooking forward to new facts and new workable ideas\u201d, a senior EU official said. But hopes of a breakthrough are low, with both sides emphasising that the bilateral meeting will also address the global economy and foreign policy questions. No deal has become the default scenario for EU officials, since Johnson wrote to Tusk on Monday calling on the EU to scrap the backstop, the insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Since that letter and Johnson\u2019s statements that he believes a no deal could take place, \u201cthe EU and our member states need to take that possibility of a no-deal outcome much more seriously than before\u201d, a senior EU official said. \u201cI know that this [no deal] is the working assumption. Because we are responsible people, we have to prepare ourselves for that, the worst possible outcome \u2013 but still likely \u2013 if you listen to the declarations of Prime Minister Johnson.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair\u2019s UK flights were operating as normal on Thursday morning despite a strike by pilots, the airline has said. There were fears of widespread disruption after a judge rejected a high court attempt by the airline to force pilots to return to work. Ryanair reported a 97% punctuality rate for its first departures and arrivals at UK airports on Thursday, blaming the small number of delays on air traffic control issues. A judge rejected an application on Wednesday for an injunction against the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa), which would have forced pilots to return to work. Balpa said it had offered to reopen negotiations with the airline after the ruling, in a final attempt to avert strike action. The union said the Ireland-based airline had \u201crejected the offer out of hand\u201d, so the strikes would go ahead as planned between 00:01 on Thursday until 23:59 on Friday. Brian Strutton,the union\u2019s general secretary, said Balpa had attempted to re-enter negotiations, claiming \u201cwe extended an olive branch to Ryanair as a way of getting back around the table and calling off strikes over the next two days\u201d. Balpa said the walkout was caused by a longstanding dispute over pay and conditions. The airline said it expected most of its flights to continue as normal, emphasising that while small disruptions could occur, it it did not expect significant disruptions during the strike.

At the time, the German chancellor\u2019s spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, condemned the attacks, saying \u201csuch riotous assemblies, the hunting down of people who appear to be from different backgrounds or the attempt to spread hate in the streets, these have no place in our country\u201d.</p> <p>But the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, directly contradicted the chancellor, telling the Bild newspaper that he shared \u201cthe scepticism towards media reports of rightwing extremists chasing down foreigners in Chemnitz\u201d, and that \u201cdeliberate misinformation\u201d had been spread.</p> <p>In the fall-out over the comments Maa\u00dfen lost his job and the governing coalition between Merkel\u2019s centre-right CDU and the centre-left SPD clashed to a point where their working alliance appeared to be on the brink of collapse.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A Syrian asylum seeker accused of a killing that sparked a week of far-right street violence in the eastern German city of Chemnitz in 2018 has been found guilty of manslaughter. Alaa Sheikhi, 24, was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison by the Chemnitz higher regional court on Thursday. The trial was held in the state capital of Dresden for security reasons and because of what the court called the \u201cextraordinarily high public interest\u201d. The timing of the ruling is sensitive, coming just a over a week before state elections in Saxony in which the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland could emerge as the strongest party. The court verdict also comes almost exactly a year after Sheikhi and an accomplice are believed to have stabbed to death 35-year-old Daniel Hillig, a carpenter with German-Cuban roots, following a confrontation. The main suspect, a 22-year-old Iraqi man referred to in German media only as Farhad A, remains at large and is believed to have fled the country. The atmosphere in Chemnitz turned sour soon after news of Hillig\u2019s death became public, culminating in two days of far-right street violence that left several people injured. Some people were filmed chasing foreigners through streets, while others were seen with Nazi-linked banners and giving the straight-arm salute. After police shut down a street festival, Chemnitz became the scene for a week of far-right protests, attended by thousands of neo-Nazis from across the country. The Chemnitz riots also threw into doubt the future of Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government. At the time, the German chancellor\u2019s spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, condemned the attacks, saying \u201csuch riotous assemblies, the hunting down of people who appear to be from different backgrounds or the attempt to spread hate in the streets, these have no place in our country\u201d. But the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, directly contradicted the chancellor, telling the Bild newspaper that he shared \u201cthe scepticism towards media reports of rightwing extremists chasing down foreigners in Chemnitz\u201d, and that \u201cdeliberate misinformation\u201d had been spread. In the fall-out over the comments Maa\u00dfen lost his job and the governing coalition between Merkel\u2019s centre-right CDU and the centre-left SPD clashed to a point where their working alliance appeared to be on the brink of collapse.",

      "body": "<p>My father, Bill Finch, who has died aged 95, lived a life of rich cultural experience, despite inauspicious beginnings. He sang tenor in London churches for 50 years and became a close friend of Benjamin Britten\u2019s sister, Beth Welford.</p> <p>Bill was born into poverty in Westminster, the youngest of seven children of Emma and Cornelius Finch. His father, a greengrocer, deserted the family, and his mother died when Bill was five. He was entrusted to the Church of England Waifs and Strays Society (now the Children\u2019s Society). He was fostered out and then sent to an orphanage.</p> <p>Aged 14, he was apprenticed to a printer in Frome, Somerset, but managed to return to London, becoming, eventually, a civil service clerk; at the time he lived with his married sister. He then began a journey of self-education.</p> <p>He joined the choir at <a href=\"https://www.stgabrielspimlico.com/\" title=\"\">St Gabriel\u2019s</a>, Pimlico, read and memorised the great English poets, saw Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud perform Shakespeare and in 1938 went to his first Prom, to hear Britten play the premiere of his Piano Concerto. Bill\u2019s brother-in-law, a dustman, would queue up for cheap tickets for him after his early morning shift.</p> <p>During the blitz in 1940 Bill was among London\u2019s youngest air raid wardens. He subsequently joined the 7th Hussars, who fought their way up through Italy, liberating cities as they went. In each city Bill went to the opera as the Italians had tried to keep the opera houses open. After VE day, he served in the Berlin military government, going to hear Herbert von Karajan and Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler in the evenings.</p> <p>In 1947 Bill rejoined the civil service, in what became the Ministry of Technology, and slowly progressed to the administrative grades. But his real life was cultural. He acquired a fine italic script, taught himself calligraphy and gold-leafing and became a wine connoisseur. He sang the Sunday services as a tenor, first at <a href=\"https://www.chelseaparish.org/stlukesandchristchurchchelsea.htm\" title=\"\">St Luke\u2019s, Chelsea</a>, then, in the 1960s, at St Marylebone parish church and finally, for 25 years, at St Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield.</p> <p>In 1974 he went to his first Aldeburgh festival. His last was in 2013. He lodged initially, by chance, with Beth, who became a close friend.</p> <p>After retirement from the civil service, Bill became a librarian for a number of barristers\u2019 chambers until the age of 88. He revelled in the company of barristers, particularly those at the chambers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/apr/02/anthony-scrivener\" title=\"\">Anthony Scrivener</a>.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Nancy Prudence, whom he met at St Gabriel\u2019s after the second world war, and married in 1948, his children, Paul and me, two grandchildren, James and Alexander, and three great-grandchildren.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My father, Bill Finch, who has died aged 95, lived a life of rich cultural experience, despite inauspicious beginnings. He sang tenor in London churches for 50 years and became a close friend of Benjamin Britten\u2019s sister, Beth Welford. Bill was born into poverty in Westminster, the youngest of seven children of Emma and Cornelius Finch. His father, a greengrocer, deserted the family, and his mother died when Bill was five. He was entrusted to the Church of England Waifs and Strays Society (now the Children\u2019s Society). He was fostered out and then sent to an orphanage. Aged 14, he was apprenticed to a printer in Frome, Somerset, but managed to return to London, becoming, eventually, a civil service clerk; at the time he lived with his married sister. He then began a journey of self-education. He joined the choir at St Gabriel\u2019s, Pimlico, read and memorised the great English poets, saw Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud perform Shakespeare and in 1938 went to his first Prom, to hear Britten play the premiere of his Piano Concerto. Bill\u2019s brother-in-law, a dustman, would queue up for cheap tickets for him after his early morning shift. During the blitz in 1940 Bill was among London\u2019s youngest air raid wardens. He subsequently joined the 7th Hussars, who fought their way up through Italy, liberating cities as they went. In each city Bill went to the opera as the Italians had tried to keep the opera houses open. After VE day, he served in the Berlin military government, going to hear Herbert von Karajan and Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler in the evenings. In 1947 Bill rejoined the civil service, in what became the Ministry of Technology, and slowly progressed to the administrative grades. But his real life was cultural. He acquired a fine italic script, taught himself calligraphy and gold-leafing and became a wine connoisseur. He sang the Sunday services as a tenor, first at St Luke\u2019s, Chelsea, then, in the 1960s, at St Marylebone parish church and finally, for 25 years, at St Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield. In 1974 he went to his first Aldeburgh festival. His last was in 2013. He lodged initially, by chance, with Beth, who became a close friend. After retirement from the civil service, Bill became a librarian for a number of barristers\u2019 chambers until the age of 88. He revelled in the company of barristers, particularly those at the chambers of Anthony Scrivener. He is survived by his wife, Nancy Prudence, whom he met at St Gabriel\u2019s after the second world war, and married in 1948, his children, Paul and me, two grandchildren, James and Alexander, and three great-grandchildren.",

I am excited by the increase in pupils taking visual art, but I am dismayed that some children who are good at art as well as drama, or art as well as music, have had to choose one subject over the other because of the structure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/08/british-artists-ebacc-will-damage-creativity-and-self-expression\" title=\"\">Michael Gove\u2019s Ebacc wheeze</a>, whereby even if a child can find a school that offers a timetable where art and music do not conflict, then only one subject will be counted in the Ebacc league table.</p> <p>Many headteachers ignore the Ebacc league table and sensibly focus elsewhere when it comes to celebrating their schools, but nonetheless the Ebacc is skewing the focus of our young people and damaging their wellbeing, their voices and their careers. There has been some comment from the creative industries that this uptake in visual art is a good thing for Britain plc as it puts us back on the mythical map as \u201cCreative Britain\u201d. But it\u2019s not very creative if pupils are not studying design technology in a school with no woodwork shop.

They can afford to teach arts subjects out of school hours \u2013 and they know that pupils who study the arts, who can sing, who can design, design their own future and ours. Our culture is made from all of us \u2013 rich and poor, black and white \u2013 and so should our art be made by all people, not just the wealthy who can afford to pay for music lessons and independent schools.</p> <p>I studied art in a different age. In the 1970s there was an idea in the comprehensive system that the arts were key to the development of all children. Art teachers were working in the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_art\" title=\"\">child art movement</a>. The movement was initiated by the Austrian printmaker Franz Ci\u017eek in the late 19th century. He strongly believed in the value of creativity to children \u2013 and he used his methods to help children deal with trauma <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00309230902746537\" title=\"\">in the aftermath of the first world war</a>. Art was used as an antidote.</p> <p>Earlier this year, with the help of the Imperial War Museum and the <a href=\"https://www.1418now.org.uk/\" title=\"\">14-18 NOW</a> project, we invited all A-level and FE students to make a work about what peace meant to them. The project was called <a href=\"https://www.1418now.org.uk/commissions/make-art-not-war/\" title=\"\">Make Art Not War</a>, and some extraordinary work was made. The project will run again next year.</p> <p>It\u2019s exciting to think of the arts as something unique in the school day. Art is a subject that can involve all areas of study and critically encourages children to have the confidence to air their original voices and thoughts. All school leavers need to feel that their contribution matters and counts for something.</p> <p>I am sick of operating in an art culture that is run by the privileged, where politicians who studied classical culture have the temerity to tell the general population what their children should be studying \u2013 and where culture is seen as something some people have and others don\u2019t. All people have culture and all schoolchildren should be shown it and asked to participate within it.</p> <p>I teach at London Metropolitan University in east London. It\u2019s probably the only art school in the UK that can claim to be properly diverse.

      "bodyText": "All children should be required to take at least one arts GCSE and there should be no restriction on taking more than one. This year there has been a modest increase in the number of children taking art itself \u2013 9% up on last year \u2013 but a fall elsewhere: music and drama are down, as is design technology, with uptake a staggering 23% down on last year. These figures show one thing very clearly: that politicians should stay out of the pathways pupils choose throughout their education. I am excited by the increase in pupils taking visual art, but I am dismayed that some children who are good at art as well as drama, or art as well as music, have had to choose one subject over the other because of the structure of Michael Gove\u2019s Ebacc wheeze, whereby even if a child can find a school that offers a timetable where art and music do not conflict, then only one subject will be counted in the Ebacc league table. Many headteachers ignore the Ebacc league table and sensibly focus elsewhere when it comes to celebrating their schools, but nonetheless the Ebacc is skewing the focus of our young people and damaging their wellbeing, their voices and their careers. There has been some comment from the creative industries that this uptake in visual art is a good thing for Britain plc as it puts us back on the mythical map as \u201cCreative Britain\u201d. But it\u2019s not very creative if pupils are not studying design technology in a school with no woodwork shop. A school is not a creative space with no music. Let children do the subjects they want to do. Schools should encourage and celebrate those who want to study art, music, drama or design \u2013 and those who wish to study maths and languages, too. Independent schools in general understand the arts. They can afford to teach arts subjects out of school hours \u2013 and they know that pupils who study the arts, who can sing, who can design, design their own future and ours. Our culture is made from all of us \u2013 rich and poor, black and white \u2013 and so should our art be made by all people, not just the wealthy who can afford to pay for music lessons and independent schools. I studied art in a different age. In the 1970s there was an idea in the comprehensive system that the arts were key to the development of all children. Art teachers were working in the aftermath of the child art movement. The movement was initiated by the Austrian printmaker Franz Ci\u017eek in the late 19th century. He strongly believed in the value of creativity to children \u2013 and he used his methods to help children deal with trauma in the aftermath of the first world war. Art was used as an antidote. Earlier this year, with the help of the Imperial War Museum and the 14-18 NOW project, we invited all A-level and FE students to make a work about what peace meant to them. The project was called Make Art Not War, and some extraordinary work was made. The project will run again next year. It\u2019s exciting to think of the arts as something unique in the school day. Art is a subject that can involve all areas of study and critically encourages children to have the confidence to air their original voices and thoughts. All school leavers need to feel that their contribution matters and counts for something. I am sick of operating in an art culture that is run by the privileged, where politicians who studied classical culture have the temerity to tell the general population what their children should be studying \u2013 and where culture is seen as something some people have and others don\u2019t. All people have culture and all schoolchildren should be shown it and asked to participate within it. I teach at London Metropolitan University in east London. It\u2019s probably the only art school in the UK that can claim to be properly diverse. Our students come from a broad range of cultures and show up what\u2019s on offer in most art schools because the art world is too male and pale. When will we learn to hear our children\u2019s voices? We have so much to learn from them, and the first step in doing that is ditching the Ebacc. \u2022 Bob and Roberta Smith is the pseudonym of British contemporary artist Patrick Brill",

      "bodyText": "Richard Braine, the new Ukip leader, has been accused of whipping up religious tensions and anti-Muslim prejudice after leaked emails showed he argued that people should no more want Muslims to settle in their country than Nazis. Braine, who won the leadership after a campaign in which he expressed anti-Islam views, also suggested that non-Muslims needed to help Muslims to \u201ccast out their demon\u201d and argued there was no such thing as \u201cmoderate Muslims\u201d. One email reads: \u201cThe nonsense of the moderate Muslim is trotted out repeatedly by so many people with good intentions, but wilful ignorance of Islamic teaching. There is no moderate Islam. Get used to it. It\u2019s a fact. When people talk about moderate Muslims they are making an error. It is like saying Hitler wasn\u2019t such a bad fellow, quite a laugh actually, an entertaining speaker, a patron of the arts \u2013 he loved Wagner \u2013 he made the trains run on time, and just look at his smart uniforms. It is to ignore completely the ideology to which the person is religiously wedded.\u201d He added: \u201cYou should no more apologise for a moderate Muslim, and wish him to settle in your country, than you should a moderate Maoist or Nazi.\u201d The emails to associates were leaked to the Guardian from within Ukip because of alarm among some left in the dwindling party about its continued links with the far-right figure Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. Matthew McGregor from the anti-fascist campaign group Hope Not Hate said Ukip was now \u201cthe party of Tommy Robinson and anti-Muslim prejudice\u201d. \u201cDespite all the chaos around Brexit, the party is mired at 1% in the polls. They\u2019re seeking to stoke tension in communities in the desperate hope of regaining relevancy. It\u2019s time for them to join previous failed far-right parties in the dustbin of history,\u201d he said.

Ukip\u2019s ruling national executive committee was so alarmed at Batten\u2019s stance that it blocked him from standing again for the leadership, but his ally Braine was elected instead by the membership.

      "bodyText": "The Czech Republic is in the grip of a repressive dictatorship. The death penalty has been introduced for minor financial offences. Memorials marking the 1989 Velvet Revolution that toppled communism have been demolished. The all-powerful national leader has shut critical newspapers, eliminated political and business rivals, installed members of his own family to head state institutions and even relocated the central bank headquarters to his own home. His conduct is so extreme that Kim Jong-un, the communist leader of North Korea, voices astonishment. This dark scenario forms the backdrop to an escape room game set in 2023, devised as an expression of opposition to Andrej Babi\u0161, the real-life Czech prime minister and billionaire tycoon. Babi\u0161\u2019s premiership has been marked by police inquiries, scandalous revelations over his business dealings and mass protests demanding his resignation \u2013 including one on Wednesday night marking the anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of the former Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the brutal suppression of a demonstration a year later in which five people died. Thousands of people gathered in Prague\u2019s Wenceslas Square to voice discontent with Babi\u0161 and his ally Milo\u0161 Zeman, the president, before heading to the headquarters of the former ruling Communist party where chants of \u201cshame\u201d went up and protest slogans were chalked on the ground. The escape room challenges participants to find evidence that will entrap a politician called Bure\u0161, transparently based on the prime minister. Bure\u0161 was Babi\u0161\u2019s presumed code name when it is believed he worked as an informant to the communist-era secret police, the StB \u2013 claims he disputes despite court rulings to the contrary.

      "bodyText": "Police in Long Beach, California, appear to have thwarted a mass shooting by arresting a hotel cook who had amassed an astonishing cache of powerful firearms and had well-laid plans to carry out a gun rampage throughout the hotel. Rodolfo Montoya, 37, was picked up at his home in Huntington Beach on Tuesday. The previous day he had allegedly confessed to a fellow worker at the Long Beach Marriott that he planned to carry out the attack as a revenge act for a grudge he bore the company. The fellow worker immediately sounded the alarm. In ensuing searches, police discovered the pile of firearms that included pistols, two assault rifles of the sort used in several recent mass shootings, a pump-action shotgun and thousands of rounds of ammunition. The alleged foiled plot to attack the Marriott once again puts the spotlight on America\u2019s lax gun laws. A key question being addressed by detectives is how Montoya came to amass such a stash of deadly weapons without drawing attention to himself. It is thought that he had no prior criminal record, which would have freed him to buy some firearms over the counter. Even so, several of the weapons in his possession are illegal in California including the assault rifles and investigators will try to find out whether he obtained them by nefarious means or out of state. Robert Luna, the police chief of Long Beach, addressed the guns issue on Tuesday. He recognized a \u201cserious conversation\u201d was taking place across the US about access to lethal weapons. \u201cThere is no question that as a country and as a community, we are having a conversation about that and need to do more, and we should be doing more,\u201d he said. Donald Trump promised to tighten background checks on the sale of firearms in the wake of the pair of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, earlier this month that killed 31 people. But in a pattern that has been seen before he subsequently walked back his pledges having been lobbied by the National Rifle Association. But Trump is likely to remain under pressure over gun policy given the spate of arrests being made across the country of individuals apparently motivated to carry out copycat attacks after El Paso and Dayton. Montoya\u2019s arrest in California brings to at least seven the number of mass shootings or white supremacist plots that police claim to have intercepted since the Texas rampage. They included Conor Climo, 23, from Las Vegas who allegedly planned to attack Jews and a gay bar in the city. Climo is reported to have told police that he belonged to a neo-Nazi group.

      "bodyText": "Laura Ashley has slumped to an annual loss of more than \u00a314m after a collapse in demand for its signature floral home furnishings. The retailer said Brexit concerns had hit consumer confidence and stopped shoppers from making big-ticket purchases or starting big DIY projects. At the same time, the housing market has slowed and house moves are key to the health of specialist retailers like Laura Ashley. As a result, like-for-like furniture sales were down 9% and demand for its decorating products, which include curtains and wallpaper, was down nearly 14%. The chairman of Laura Ashley, Andrew Khoo, said all home furnishings retailers had been battling \u201cdifficult\u201d trading conditions but conceded that problems with its own ranges meant sales had fallen short of its competitors. Khoo, who succeeded his father as chairman last year, said the chain was adding contemporary ranges in an effort to improve performance. \u201cWe are confident in the resilience of our brand but we have a lot of work to do to make sure it stays relevant for the future,\u201d he added. Last year the retailer said it was closing a quarter of its 160 UK stores. So far six have shut and the company said more would close over the next 12 months. Laura Ashley, which is listed in the UK but controlled by the Malaysian group MUI, has been struggling for some time. The company, which issued two profit warnings earlier this year, made a pre-tax loss of \u00a314.3m in the year to 30 June. Last year it broke even. In the UK, which accounts for the lion\u2019s share of the business, sales fell 5% to \u00a3223m, hurt by store closures and \u201cconsiderable market uncertainty\u201d.

Wellbeing during study is just as important as the results themselves.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the government\u2019s reforms have seen a significant increase in the number of exams that students must take, perversely the breadth of subjects is getting narrower. We have lost the \u2018general\u2019 element of GCSEs, which is a disservice to all concerned.</p> <p>\u201cNAHT believes that students should have access to a wide variety of options at GCSE, but we continue to see an overall decline in the number of non-EBacc subjects taken. Design and Technology entries, for example, have dropped below 100,000 this year, which is worrying when you consider how important that subject could be for many young people.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been interesting this week to hear the many voices raised in opposition to the EBacc, which pushes schools to offer only a narrow core of academic subjects with only a couple of extra options for other subjects covering the arts, technology, creative and vocational subjects. Even Kenneth Baker, the architect of GCSEs, says this is wrong, and we agree.</p> <p>\u201cThe purpose of GCSEs is to offer a general education. This needs to be broad so that every student can find a combination of subjects that works for them. A Levels, college and university courses are the time and place for students to choose to specialise.</p> <p>\u201cThe EBacc distorts the curriculum offer to no real benefit, certainly not to students. It is much too early in their school lives to enforce a narrowing of the curriculum. The EBacc is a curse that schools and students have to operate under, and it is high time we did away with it.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5e62298f08a0805bcc2699\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-22T09:38:59.456Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, has a word of caution about the increased uptake in French and Spanish.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe improvement in the uptake of French and Spanish this year is encouraging, but it is nowhere near enough to make up for the decline in entries to modern foreign languages since 2010. Even taking into account this year\u2019s improvement in French uptake, entries in this subject have still fallen by more than 40,000 since 2010 in England. German entries have fallen again this year and by more than 25,000 since 2010. These subjects are part of the English Baccalaureate suite but students are deterred from taking them because of their perceived difficulty.</p> <p>\u201cIt is clear that we need to rethink the way in which we measure the performance of schools, and that our schools and colleges urgently need an improved level of funding from the government.

And this is the first year that students have sat reformed GCSEs in media studies, design and technology, and sociology. </p> <p>The new system is designed to be more academically rigorous and to better differentiate the highest achievers. Under the old system increasing numbers of pupils were achieving A*s. With two more grades, the idea for the new format is that fewer pupils will achieve the top mark.</p> <p>If last year is anything to go by, around one in five pupils are expected to score one of the three top grades this year, but only a tiny fraction of teenagers is likely to walk away with a clean sweep of 9s. </p> <p>Figures published by exams regulator Ofqual, showed that just 732 16-year-olds in England taking at least seven new GCSEs last year, scored straight 9s in all subjects.</p> <p>But Philip Nye, researcher at Education Datalab said the numbers getting straight grade 9s \u201cmight go up a little bit because there are more subjects in the 9-1 system, but it is very difficult to say what will happen.\u201d </p> <p>Pupils in Wales will still have exams graded on the A to G scale, but the content has also been reformed. In Northern Ireland there is a mix of both letter and numerical grades depending on the exam board.</p> <p>Our data team will be crunching the numbers throughout the day. And after the results are released, at around 9.30am, we\u2019ll be gauging all the agony of ecstasy of students. </p> <p>Good luck. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-22T06:36:49.887Z\">at 7.36am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from this morning\u2019s GCSE live blog, after a nerve-wracking morning for 16-year-olds across the country. We hope you got the grades you were after. Here are this morning\u2019s toplines \u2013 The proportion of GCSEs awarded top grades has risen for the second year in a row. More than one in five (20.8%) UK GCSE entries scored one of the three top grades this year, up from 20.5% last summer. The proportion receiving the top grades - at least a 7 or an A grade - is the highest since 2015 and marks the second year-on-year rise in a row. The introduction of more rigorous GCSE courses in England and elsewhere in the UK appears to have benefited girls more than boys, including in subjects such as physics and maths, where girls have narrowed the gap in results previously enjoyed by boys at age 16. It is the third year of results for the new-style GCSE exams in England, which have more complex content, a greater reliance on final exam results and replace the previous A* to G grades with a scale running from 9 to 1. The new GCSEs have been criticised in recent days by headteachers, teaching unions and the Girlguiding movement for increasing levels of stress among pupils, and for being too demanding for many pupils, including those with special needs. Naomi Larsson on our community team has been gathering reaction from our readers. Disha Hedge, 16, from Milton Keynes, has just received her results from the Royal Latin School in Buckinghamshire. She is \u201cover the moon\u201d, achieving 10 grade 9s and one grade 8, but she says it was very stressful adapting to the new system. \u201cNot only did we have a lack of resources and past papers, but also there are very big differences between marks awarded from different examiners, especially in essay subjects such as English and history, which are obviously quite subjective. \u201cIt was extremely nerve-wracking to have the thought that I might miss my targets due to inconsistency within the new system. The new grade 9, which is higher than an A * definitely added to the pressure.\u201d Syeda Tasnia Tahsin, 16, is at Connaught School for Girls in London\u2019s Leytonstone. She achieved above her predicted grades, and got 9 in English language. Syeda came to the UK from Bangladesh aged seven and spoke no English. She says she\u2019s gained confidence over time and has become more outspoken. Syeda is now a spoken word artist and in early August she had a week-long run at the Edinburgh Fringe about the impact of media perceptions on young people, terrorism and grooming. She hopes to study PPE at Oxford and will be doing A-levels in Economics, Politics and Sociology. \u201cI am so proud of myself to see how far I have come, considering how overwhelming and challenging the new exam system was.I am exhilarated and so proud of the results I have achieved.\u201d Joe Lena studies in Kings Heath, Birmingham. He achieved grade 9 in film studies, grade 8 in product design, combined science and food tech, grade 7 maths and grade 6 English. He plans to go to college and continue studying, and is relieved that his GCSEs are now over: \u201cI\u2019ve seen all around me that people feel more pressured with now having two \u2018pass grades\u2019 with a grade 4 being seen as less significant than a 5. There is a lot of pressure on higher achieving students too to get the top grade now being much harder than an A*. AQA as an exam board (especially in English) seem very harsh, I haven\u2019t seen anyone get higher than a 6. \u201cThis entire season has been incredibly stressful and I\u2019m so glad to see the end of it. Michael Gove doesn\u2019t understand what he has done to the pupils sitting these exams.\u201d Computing attracted more than 77,000 English students in 2019, a 7.6% increase on the 2018 figure. At first glance this looks like a healthy increase ... but it isn\u2019t the full story. Before computing, which was first introduced as a GCSE subject in 2014, there was ICT. However, even after the computing exam came on board, ICT remained an option for GCSE students, indeed 42,480 sat the exam last year. However, in 2019 ICT is no more. So the combined number of entries for ICT and computing stood at 114,408 last year, falling to 77,407 computing students this year, a 32% drop. If there is good news to be had it is that the proportion of girls taking computing is now at 21.7%, up from 20.4% in 2018. The overall number of computer entries rose by 7.6% but as we pointed out earlier on, the uptake among girls accelerated even more, up 14.5% compared to 2018. 15-year-old Victoria Chung, a pupil at the Brighton private school Roedean, has been awarded an astonishing 12 grade nines in her GCSEs. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it when I saw the results,\u201d said Chung, who had flown in from Hong Kong to pick up her results. \u201cI was so panicky last night thinking about it but all the hard work has paid off. I just got my head down and worked hard across Year 10 and 11 \u2013 that\u2019s the only way.\u201d Chung got the top grade in art and design, biology, physics, chemistry, Chinese, German, English literature, English language, maths, further maths, history and business studies. Roedean said it had received its best set of exam results in its 134-year history. A third of the grades awarded to its 99-pupil cohort were grade 9s. 70% of the grades awarded were 7,8 or 9 \u2013 the equivalent to A or above in old grades. Thirteen girls got at least eight 9 grades and five got a clean sweep of ten 9s. R\u00e9mi de Fleurian on the Guardian\u2019s data team has been looking at the proportion of English students taking up French and Spanish this year. Last week he reported that, for the first time ever, more English A-level students took Spanish than French. Although the popularity of Spanish among GCSE students increased for the second year running, French witnessed a bit of a comeback with a 4% increase in entries this year compared to 2018, reversing the trend over the past five years. Over 120,000 students took the exam, meaning it remains the most popular language. Spanish was taken by almost 97,000 students took this year - an impressive 8% gain on last year - while German decreased by 3% to 41,000. More from the King David High School in Liverpool, where Charlotte Dunn, 16, has exceeded her own expectations. Dunn received nine GCSEs \u2013 including a 7 in English Literature, an 8 in Art and Design and in Maths a 9 or the equivalent of an A** (yes, those exist now). \u201cI\u2019m really, really pleased,\u201d she beamed. \u201cI was quite nervous when the exams got closer, but once you get in there and you sit down, you just have to tell yourself you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been really nice to relax and calm down over summer,\u201d said Charlotte, who added that flashcards were a godsend during months of revision. She also drew up a timetable of studying, which, according to her parents was completely of her own volition. \u201cIt was actually a bit scary,\u201d said her dad, Ian Dunn. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a bit of a last minute person, but she\u2019s so organised.\u201d Charlotte\u2019s mum, Paula, said despite paper leaks, she thought social media had been a blessing in disguise during the exam period. \u201cWhen they\u2019ve come out of an exam and are a bit in doubt, they\u2019ll go on Twitter and see that other people were confused by certain questions too \u2013 it puts their mind at rest a bit,\u201d she said. Charlotte, who dreams of getting into creative marketing or advertising one day, will begin A Levels in Graphic Design, Psychology and Business in September. Professor Simon Swain, vice-president for research and higher education policy at the British Academy, has commented on today\u2019s results. \u201cThe small increase in entries in modern languages GCSE for England is a positive sign that the long-term decline may be starting to change,\u201d he said. \u201cStill only around half of school pupils in England are taking a qualification in a language other than English at this stage, compared to three quarters in 2002.\u201d The British Academy, a national body for humanities and social sciences, campaigns for greater provision of language-learning across the UK. The University of Warwick professor of classics and greco-arabic studies added: Learning a language is about far more than being able to communicate when we travel abroad on holiday or on business. It broadens our mental horizons and helps us to understand and respect other cultures and communities. There is now increasing evidence that competence in languages is beneficial for learning in other curriculum subjects and for cognitive function more generally too. Learning a second language presents real advantages from an early age, which is why I hope this is the start of a more positive trend for language education in schools. We ought to take this opportunity to excel once again in language-learning and the British Academy is working with other stakeholders to determine how best to ensure the sustainability of the whole pipeline for language study and research. Some very proud parents out there on Twitter ... The number of girls doing computing at GCSE has risen with female entries up 14%, PA reports. Computing entries saw an increase overall of 7.2% to 80,027, with the the number of female entries up from 15,046 in 2018 to 17,158 in 2019. Females continued to outperform males in the subject, with 24.9% of females compared to 20.8% of males scoring the top grades - at least a 7 or an A grade. Some 66.2% of females scored at least a 4 or a C grade, compared to 61.7% of males. However, female entries in computing were only 21.4% of the total student numbers. There were 62,869 male entries, and an increase in the number scoring top grades from 20.1% in 2018 to 20.8% in 2019. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College leaders, said: \u201cIt mirrors what we were seeing last week when we saw more girls doing sciences than boys at A-level. \u201cThe encouraging part of that is that females are thinking \u2018this is as much a part of my world as it it my brother\u2019s\u2019, so I think that\u2019s a really good thing.\u201d Derek Richardson, vice president and responsible officer at the Pearson examinations body, said: \u201cIncreases in computing entries and outcomes - for both females and males - show that young people recognise the changing nature of the world and are preparing themselves for needing an increasingly digital toolkit for their future studies or careers. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see female entries are up 14% on last year.\u201d Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, has passed on her congratulations to all those getting results today. But she remains alarmed by research earlier this week which showed that disadvantaged pupils are almost twice as likely to fail GCSE maths as their wealthier classmates. She said: \u201cIt is deeply concerning that disadvantaged young people are far less likely to get good GCSE grades, creating an inequality that will remain for years to come. \u201cThis government, by cutting school funding for the first time in a generation and creating a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention, is making it harder for young people to succeed, while those going on to further education will once again see the impact of nearly a decade of Conservative cuts to education.\u201d The school leaders union, NAHT, is concerned that the general nature of the GCSE is becoming narrowed. Paul Whiteman, its general secretary, said: \u201cWe remain concerned about the impact that the increased content and greater number of exams can and will have on everyone. Wellbeing during study is just as important as the results themselves. \u201cAlthough the government\u2019s reforms have seen a significant increase in the number of exams that students must take, perversely the breadth of subjects is getting narrower. We have lost the \u2018general\u2019 element of GCSEs, which is a disservice to all concerned. \u201cNAHT believes that students should have access to a wide variety of options at GCSE, but we continue to see an overall decline in the number of non-EBacc subjects taken. Design and Technology entries, for example, have dropped below 100,000 this year, which is worrying when you consider how important that subject could be for many young people. \u201cIt has been interesting this week to hear the many voices raised in opposition to the EBacc, which pushes schools to offer only a narrow core of academic subjects with only a couple of extra options for other subjects covering the arts, technology, creative and vocational subjects. Even Kenneth Baker, the architect of GCSEs, says this is wrong, and we agree. \u201cThe purpose of GCSEs is to offer a general education. This needs to be broad so that every student can find a combination of subjects that works for them. A Levels, college and university courses are the time and place for students to choose to specialise. \u201cThe EBacc distorts the curriculum offer to no real benefit, certainly not to students. It is much too early in their school lives to enforce a narrowing of the curriculum. The EBacc is a curse that schools and students have to operate under, and it is high time we did away with it.\u201d Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, has a word of caution about the increased uptake in French and Spanish. \u201cThe improvement in the uptake of French and Spanish this year is encouraging, but it is nowhere near enough to make up for the decline in entries to modern foreign languages since 2010. Even taking into account this year\u2019s improvement in French uptake, entries in this subject have still fallen by more than 40,000 since 2010 in England. German entries have fallen again this year and by more than 25,000 since 2010. These subjects are part of the English Baccalaureate suite but students are deterred from taking them because of their perceived difficulty. \u201cIt is clear that we need to rethink the way in which we measure the performance of schools, and that our schools and colleges urgently need an improved level of funding from the government. We also need a national strategy on improving the uptake of modern foreign languages rather than trying to lever entries through the blunt instrument of school performance measures.\u201d And now for the clever clogs...the proportion of top marks - which among English students is a 9 grade - rose this year among both boys and girls. More than 5% of exams sat by girls in England resulted in a 9 grade. Amy Walker has been speaking to delighted pupils at a voluntary aided King David High School in Liverpool \u2013 a Jewish school that admits children from 11 to 18 of all faiths. Ben Franks, 16, is among those now in the queue to register for the school\u2019s sixth form after receiving GCSE grades including an 8 (equivalent to an A*), two 7s (A) and three 6s (B). Revising \u201cgot really weird at one point,\u201d he said. \u201cI basically developed a caffeine addiction.\u201d Although he spent a lot of time procrastinating, for the final two months before exams Ben said he had revised every night. His mum, Stella Franks, added: \u201cWe\u2019ve had to wean him off the coffee this summer.\u201d Despite his hard work, Ben\u2019s grades have still come as a pleasant surprise. He thought he\u2019d flunked English Literature and was \u201cabsolutely mortified\u201d after the exam, according to his mum. \u201cI just came out of the exam not as confident as before,\u201d he said, \u201cBut I got an 8.\u201d Ben, who will begin A Levels in art and design, English language and economics in September, hopes to study Architecture at degree level. Also pleased with his results is Ben Williams, 16, who is leaving the school to begin an apprenticeship in hairdressing. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t really stress and I\u2019ve been calm throughout it, but my grades are much better than I was expecting,\u201d said Ben, who achieved three 7s. He\u2019s looking forward to joining the world of work. \u201cI don\u2019t really fit well in a school environment. I did some work experience at a hairdressers and really enjoyed it,\u201d he said. The overall pass rate at King David was above the average in England, Wales and Northern Ireland this year \u2013 at 68.4% compared to 67.3%. Headteacher Michael Sutton said he was pleased with the results but had, like his pupils, been expecting the worst. \u201cI\u2019m a glass half empty type of person,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much pressure on them now, and on staff,\u201d he said, adding that he thought the introduction of tougher exams had been a \u201cdreadful idea\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more content to fit it. If you don\u2019t extend the length of the school year you have to cram everything in,\u201d he said. Not to be outdone by all the many reforms undertaken in England in recent years, Northern Ireland decided to shake things up, introducing a new C* grade in 2019, equivalent to the English 5 grade. While the proportion of A grades and above grew to 31.4%, the percentage of students achieving a C grade or above (including the new C* grade) also increased marginally. While much of the attention on GCSE results day revolves around England, students in other parts of the country are also opening their results with trepidation this morning. In Wales, where exam grades have remained blissfully reform-free, it was a mixed bag when compared to last year. The proportion of A grades or higher fell ever-so-slightly from 18.1% to 17.9% while those achieving a C or above rose by almost 2%. Katharine Birbalsingh, head teacher at Michaela community school in Wembley - a well-known free school, is delighted by its first ever set of GCSE results. She said her pupils \u201csmash it\u201d after 18% got a 9. The British Council has welcomed the improved take up in foreign languages. There was a 3% increase in modern foreign language entries, which had been in sharp decline for years. French remains the most popular language at GCSE, though Spanish entries went up 7.5%. German entries dropped again, as did Chinese, where numbers fell from 4,410 to 3,200. Vicky Gough, British Council schools advisor, said: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that GCSE numbers are picking up, but this has to be seen as a slight recovery from a huge drop over more than a decade. \u201cHopefully these rising numbers will have a knock-on effect as pupils take A-Levels and university courses, because the UK needs more foreign language speakers. \u201cLanguages underpin our relationships with other countries. They are vital to the UK\u2019s future prosperity, security and global influence, and they are important to pupils because they open doors to new people, places and cultures.\u201d Don\u2019t forget the teachers, says Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. He said: We are nearing the end of a massive programme of qualification reforms which has been extremely challenging. Our teachers deserve a huge amount of credit for all that they have done to support students taking new GCSEs which have been deliberately designed to be more difficult, and which have undoubtedly caused increased levels of stress and anxiety. \u201cIt is great to see that there has been an increase in entries to art and design. However, we continue to be concerned about the long-term decline in the uptake of other creative arts subjects, and design and technology. This has been caused by the government\u2019s obsession with measuring schools largely on performance in a small suite of traditional academic subjects combined with education cuts which have left them without enough funding to sustain smaller-entry courses.\u201d In Wales, where exams are still graded with the old letter format, the number overall performance has increased but those achieving top grades has remained stable. The Welsh government said overall performance is up 1.2% with 62.8% achieving A*-C grades. Those achieving A*- A pass stayed the same at 18.4%. The percentage of pupils gaining A*-A and A*-C grades in all individual sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physics). Some 58.1% of students achieved grade A*-C in GCSE Mathematics Wales\u2019s education minister, Kirsty Williams, said: \u201cLast year we saw a dramatic increase of 50% in entries for science GCSEs. I am pleased to see that entries and results are continuing on the upward trend, with more pupils gaining A*-C and more achieving the very top grades in Biology, Chemistry and Physics. \u201cThis increase in learners being entered means more young people are accessing qualifications that lead to greater opportunities for further science study and careers, paving the way for the future scientists of Wales.\u201d She added: \u201cThis was the first year learners sat the new Welsh Second Language GCSE full course, following removal of the short course option last year. \u201cAs this is a more challenging qualification, it was expected that overall attainment would be effected with many more learners taking the new full course. However, the number of pupils achieving A*-C results are up by over 1,300. \u201cThere is still work to be done, but the new GCSE provides learners with a stronger focus on speaking, listening, and using the language practically in their day to day lives.\u201d Boris Johnson has passed on his \u201chuge congratulations\u201d to everyone receiving their GCSE results today. In a statement he said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to see an increase in those studying EBacc subjects \u2013 including science, computing and foreign languages \u2013 as well as creative studies, meaning pupils are getting the rigorous yet well-rounded education they need. \u201cAs I said last week, my government will do all we can to increase funding for education, and to give schools the powers they need to deal with bad behaviour and bullying so pupils continue to learn effectively.\u201d Proud father moment ... my brilliant daughter passed 11 GCSEs. All bar one were 7 or above, including three 9s. Way to go girl! Maths remains the most popular subject among English GCSE students with English and English literature retaining their popularity. The recently reformed double science exam gained 5% more students when compared to 2018 while the number of students taking history grew by 7% and art and design was up by almost 10%. The exam regulator Ofqual has this graphic showing the improvement in this year\u2019s grades top grades. It shows a slightly sharper increase in those achieving the top three grades, than reported earlier by PA. Ofqual says the increase went from 21.4% last year to 21.9% in 2019 for 16 year olds only. The introduction of more rigorous GCSE courses in England and elsewhere in the UK appears to have benefited girls more than boys, including in subjects such as physics and maths, where girls have narrowed the gap in results previously enjoyed by boys at age 16. More than one in four exam entries by girls received top grades of A, or 7, and above in this summer\u2019s exams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, an improvement of half a percentage point to 25.3% compared with last year, while just 18.6% of entries by 16-year-old boys achieved the same grades. In England girls won the majority of the coveted top 9 grade, with 5.2% of female entries gaining the grade that replaced the top tier of the previous A* grade, compared with 3.7% of boys and a combined rate of 4.5%. Just below that, 13.1% of girls gained a level 8, compared with 9.4% of boys. Some 837 students this year achieved 9s in seven or more subjects, a slight increase on last year, when just five students achieved 9s in 12 subjects. In maths, the largest single subject, there was a substantial closing of the gap between boys and girls at age 16. While the proportion of boys obtaining top grades nudged up slightly to 20.6%, the proportion of girls getting A/7 or above leapt by nearly a percentage point, from 19% last year to 19.9%, more than halving the difference between the two groups. In physics \u2013 a subject traditionally dominated by boys \u2013 girls made large strides in eliminating the gap in grades, which is close to disappearing at grades C, or 4, and above. In the top grades the proportion of girls jumped from 40% to 42.1%, driving a strong improvement overall, while the proportion of boys rose by just 0.3 percentage points to 46.1%. The proportion of GCSEs awarded top grades has risen for the second year in a row, PA reports. More than one in five (20.8%) UK GCSE entries scored one of the three top grades this year, up from 20.5% last summer. The proportion receiving the top grades - at least a 7 or an A grade - is the highest since 2015 and marks the second year-on-year rise in a row. The proportion of entries getting at least a 4 or a C grade is also the highest since 2015. A total of 67.3% of UK entries scored a C/4 or above, up from 66.9% last year, according to data published by the Joint Council for Qualifications. The number of UK entries getting C/4 or above in English and maths has increased slightly since last year. A total of 62% of UK entries scored C/4 or above in English, up from 61.8%, while 59.6% of entries scored C/4 in maths, up from 59.4%. The Student Room, which provides support and advice for pupils, is at Hove Park School. The first results are beginning to come in. \u201cYour mental health is more important than your grades,\u201d the children\u2019s charity NSPCC reminds pupils. My colleague Amy Walker is at Liverpool\u2019s King David high school with some nervous pupils. Exam boards have published their grade boundaries for this year\u2019s papers. OCR\u2019s grade boundaries are set out here. AQA\u2019s are here, and CCEA\u2019s here. It is not the end of the world if your result are not as good as you hoped, says Adrian Childs. Accountants have warned that the focus on exams is failing to fully prepared students for the world of work. Andrew Harding, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Management Accounts, called for more apprenticeships: \u201cOur research shows that 36% of workers don\u2019t feel they have all the skills they need to do their jobs effectively in the next five years. This figure will only increase if we don\u2019t change our approach to learning new skills and competencies. \u201cIn the past, we largely dedicated ourselves to passing exams and forged a career based on those results. Now, we must recognise the value in non-traditional routes like apprenticeships, which offer a real opportunity to fix the UK\u2019s productivity problem. As, by design, they inherently link learning and working which helps students develop a growth mind-set and prepares them for the world of work.\u201d Share your experiences with us We want to hear from pupils and educators about how you been affected by the new GCSEs. Have you achieved better results than you expected, or lower? Do you think the new system has penalised you in any way? Or have you been unaffected? You can share your experiences in the form here. You can also share your stories, photos and videos with the Guardian via WhatsApp by adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. Please ensure you include important details, like the name of your school, in the description box. Photos would be great too! If you are under-16 you will need parental permission to take part. We will include some of your responses in our ongoing coverage. Boris Johnson has passed on this good luck message: Shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, has this message to pupils awaiting results. And Nicky Morgan, former chair of the education select committee, now culture secretary, has this: Schools minister, Nick Gibb, has rejected union claims that the new format has led to some pupils refusing to take exams. Asked about the concerns of teaching unions on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Gibb said: \u201cWe have seen a significant increase in the number of entries to GCSE this year so I\u2019m not sure that I accept their their assertion about children not taking these GCSE.\u201d He also defended the new format and suggested the onus was on schools to deal with the stress of pupils. Gibb said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want children to be overstressed. Testing and exams have always being part of an education system, there will always be some stress to them. \u201cBut we trust schools to make sure that children are well prepared and are supported. So they shouldn\u2019t be that to that level of stress.\u201d He also pointed out that figures for this year showed a 3% increase in entries for arts subjects despite fears that a greater focus on academic subjects would drive out arts. He added: We have reformed the GCSE over the last few years so that people are better prepared for further study, or for an apprenticeship or technical route, or for work with training. There were criticisms of the old GCSE by employers that they weren\u2019t properly preparing young people for further study. They weren\u2019t comparable with the qualifications of some of the best performing countries around the world. We spent many years improving and consulting on these new reformed GCSE. We have conducted impact assessments to ensure that they\u2019re suitable for children of all abilities, including children with special educational needs.\u201d Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s GCSE live blog as more than 700,000 teenagers, and their anxious parents, prepare for GCSE results this morning. In England this is the second year where the grading system for most exams has switched to the numerical system with the top mark of 9, to the bottom mark of 1. A grade 7 to 9 is approximately equivalent to A to A* under the old system, while a grade 4 and above is roughly equivalent to a C and above. The content of the courses has also been made tougher, prompting teaching unions to warn that the changes have left many pupils feeling stressed with some even refusing to sit the exams. And this is the first year that students have sat reformed GCSEs in media studies, design and technology, and sociology. The new system is designed to be more academically rigorous and to better differentiate the highest achievers. Under the old system increasing numbers of pupils were achieving A*s. With two more grades, the idea for the new format is that fewer pupils will achieve the top mark. If last year is anything to go by, around one in five pupils are expected to score one of the three top grades this year, but only a tiny fraction of teenagers is likely to walk away with a clean sweep of 9s. Figures published by exams regulator Ofqual, showed that just 732 16-year-olds in England taking at least seven new GCSEs last year, scored straight 9s in all subjects. But Philip Nye, researcher at Education Datalab said the numbers getting straight grade 9s \u201cmight go up a little bit because there are more subjects in the 9-1 system, but it is very difficult to say what will happen.\u201d Pupils in Wales will still have exams graded on the A to G scale, but the content has also been reformed. In Northern Ireland there is a mix of both letter and numerical grades depending on the exam board. Our data team will be crunching the numbers throughout the day. And after the results are released, at around 9.30am, we\u2019ll be gauging all the agony of ecstasy of students. Good luck.",

      "bodyText": "High street sales have slumped at their fastest pace since 2008 in August, leaving retailers\u2019 confidence \u201ccrumbling\u201d. The CBI\u2019s health check on the retail industry found sales volumes and orders fell at the fastest rate in 10 years, while the wholesale industry experienced a drop in orders on a scale not seen since 2013. Employment in the retail sector fell for the 11th successive quarter and investment intentions for the year ahead were negative for the sixth consecutive quarter, indicating that shop owners were \u201cbuckling\u201d under rising costs and the uncertainty created by the threat of a no-deal Brexit. Retailers expected the sharpest deterioration in business conditions since February 2009 over the next three months, according to the CBI\u2019s quarterly distributive trades survey. Anna Leach, the business lobby group\u2019s deputy chief economist, said 10% of respondents reported that sales volumes were up on a year ago, compared with 58% who said they were down, giving a balance of -49%. \u201cSentiment is crumbling among retailers, and unexpectedly weak sales have led to a large overhang of stocks. With investment intentions for the year ahead and employment down, retailers expect a chilly few months ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is unsurprising that business confidence has deteriorated sharply, with a potential no-deal Brexit on the horizon. But retailers are also buckling under the cumulative burden of costs, including an outdated business rates system and the apprenticeship levy. Businesses will be looking for government action in the budget in the coming months to alleviate some of these pressures.\u201d Last week more than 50 retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, Harrods and Iceland, wrote to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, demanding tax cuts to safeguard the future of the high street amid intense pressure from online rivals. In the letter, the retail bosses called forurgent reform of the business rates system, which taxes companies based on the buildings they occupy. The heads of Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons, as well as Boots, Greggs and John Lewis, said rates were outdated and harmed investment, to the detriment of jobs and communities. The CBI data contrasts with official figures for the retail industry, which show a more buoyant sales trend. Last week the Office for National Statistics\u2019 survey, which covers the online industry more comprehensively, found that web sales increased in July, while department stores, long considered a dying breed on the high street, notched up their first increase this year. The figures, which wrong-footed City economists who had expected a 0.2% decline, showed the quantity of goods bought rose 0.2% last month, buoyed by the annual Amazon Prime Day. The CBI said internet-based, non-store retailers posted a rise in sales, but volumes dropped across most other sectors, including in grocers, clothing and hardware and DIY. Supporting the CBI\u2019s outlook, the latest IMRG Capgemini e-retail sales index, which tracks more than 200 online retailers, showed sales slumped to the lowest-ever July growth. This came despite warm weather and customer-focused events such as Amazon Prime Day.",

I played flanker, centre, everywhere in union but instantly fell in love with league. I got into the Midlands Academy side and then somehow ended up at the Broncos at the age of 17.</p> <p>\u201cThe first two seasons there were really tough but last year I really cracked it \u2013 and that earned me my move to Warrington. Growing up was a world away from this. We played in a park with Leicester Storm and used to have to walk up and down before the game collecting syringes. But I just loved league. I\u2019d miss school to play rugby league with my mates because my dream was to be a professional rugby league player.

All the London Broncos boys I played with last year, around 30-odd of them, are going to be there with my family too, so it\u2019ll be crazy. It\u2019s like going back home in a way, and having my family there too will be very special.\u201d</p> <p>Davis\u2019s move to Warrington at the start of this season, having attracted the interest of several Super League clubs while playing in the Championship for London, has certainly paid off, but the transition was not straightforward.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s taken its time to click here.

But I had to go out and earn my stripes, which I get at a club of this size.

      "bodyText": "The small Leicestershire town of Burbage is not the first place you think of when it comes to rugby league. But on Saturday, a small pocket of an area where fewer than 15,000 people reside will be travelling en masse to Wembley for the sport\u2019s showpiece event to see one of their own realise a childhood dream. Born on the outskirts of Leicester and a promising rugby union player with Leicester Tigers, Matt Davis has taken an unusual route to the top of rugby league. And the biggest game of his career will also take place a stone\u2019s throw from where his breakthrough as a professional happened only a couple of years ago. \u201cI lived just down the road from Wembley when I played for London Broncos in Ealing,\u201d Davis says. \u201cI\u2019d drive past it most days and always wonder what it would be like to play there. Hopefully on Saturday, I\u2019ll find out.\u201d It has been a whirlwind few years for the Warrington forward, culminating in an appearance in the Challenge Cup final on Saturday against St Helens. As a teenager Davis spent time in the Tigers\u2019 academy before stumbling on league after a friend introduced him to the game. \u201cUp until 16 I was still at Leicester, before someone recommended the Leicester Storm league side to me. I played flanker, centre, everywhere in union but instantly fell in love with league. I got into the Midlands Academy side and then somehow ended up at the Broncos at the age of 17. \u201cThe first two seasons there were really tough but last year I really cracked it \u2013 and that earned me my move to Warrington. Growing up was a world away from this. We played in a park with Leicester Storm and used to have to walk up and down before the game collecting syringes. But I just loved league. I\u2019d miss school to play rugby league with my mates because my dream was to be a professional rugby league player. It\u2019s a bit of a weird dream for a kid from just outside Leicester \u2026 but here we are.\u201d Davis is part of a strong rugby family \u2013 his younger brothers, Sam and Jonno, are in the academies at London and Hull respectively, and they will all be at Wembley on Saturday \u2013 with the forward covering the costs of a trip that has proved to be more expensive than anticipated. \u201cWe actually only get about three free tickets per player,\u201d Davis says with a laugh. \u201cBut I don\u2019t care, I want everyone there so I\u2019ve had to buy another dozen or so tickets, maybe more actually. All the London Broncos boys I played with last year, around 30-odd of them, are going to be there with my family too, so it\u2019ll be crazy. It\u2019s like going back home in a way, and having my family there too will be very special.\u201d Davis\u2019s move to Warrington at the start of this season, having attracted the interest of several Super League clubs while playing in the Championship for London, has certainly paid off, but the transition was not straightforward. \u201cIt\u2019s taken its time to click here. I was actually in the crowd watching Warrington play Catalans in last year\u2019s final and wondered what it would be like to play for them. But I had to go out and earn my stripes, which I get at a club of this size. I went back to London on loan for a bit and even played for Rochdale at the bottom of the Championship, but I\u2019ve worked hard and I hope everyone can see that. To now be here, on the brink of a Wembley final \u2026 it\u2019s the realisation of everything I dreamed of as a child. The cup final at Wembley is the pinnacle.\u201d Despite being second in Super League, Davis and Warrington are 16 points behind their opponents on Saturday \u2013 the runaway league leaders, St Helens \u2013 with the Wolves going to Wembley on the back of five successive league defeats. Even their coach, Steve Price, has labelled Warrington the biggest underdogs in the final\u2019s modern history. But having witnessed the shock defeat against the underdogs Catalans first-hand this time last year, Davis is confident of the outsiders triumphing again. \u201cI was in the stands for that final and Catalans showed how to handle being underdogs. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s going to be the case this year but we can thrive on the underdog tag. We\u2019ve got a great chance, better than what some people think.\u201d With around 50 friends and family to cheer him on, Saturday will be one of the most expensive days of Davis\u2019s life. If his prediction of Warrington stunning St Helens comes to fruition, it will have been worth every penny.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cIt is wonderful to feel the grandness of Canada in the raw,\u201d wrote Emily Carr, an icon of 20th-century Canadian art, whose vibrant landscape works charted the colours and shapes of the country more evocatively than any before \u2013 or since.</p> <p>To speak of this grandness in the raw is to speak of Ontario, the country\u2019s most populous province. Long before the 14 million who now call Ontario home got here, the place was shaped forever by glacial erosion that gouged and quarried so much of the land that falls within the province\u2019s boundaries.</p> <p>The result left Ontario with upwards of 250,000 lakes, and while the province boasts Canada\u2019s largest city in Toronto and its capital city in Ottawa, it is away from the urban centres that it truly offers itself as a paradise for nature lovers.</p> <p>Ontario is a place for all comers and all seasons. Adventure arrives adrenaline soaked or at a much slower pace \u2026 with plenty of options in between. And the best of those options usually come on, or at least very near, a body of water.</p> <p>In the rustic cabins and cottages that hug every one of those quarter of a million lakes, kitschy slogan wall hangings are ubiquitous, but the advice they offer is nothing if not accurate: \u201cLife is better at the lake.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>1,000 Islands</strong></h2> <p>Head downstream from Lake Ontario to the mouth of the mighty St Lawrence River and you\u2019ll reach 1,000 Islands, an archipelago of more than 1,800 islands that straddle the Canadian and US border. Cruise the islands from Kingston, Gananoque or Rockport all the way up the St Lawrence to take in stunning seasonal views. And yes, these same islands are forever commemorated in a condiment \u2013 the eponymous salad dressing originates from these parts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"120722fea2131233c6f29f1cf0821a047ab3670f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/120722fea2131233c6f29f1cf0821a047ab3670f/0_118_7339_4404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Thousand Islands Region as seen from a Skydeck.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1,000 Islands are perfect for outdoor activities, on land and water.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Lipov/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The 1,000 Islands are perfect for outdoor activities, on land and water</p></li> </ul> <p>But of course there\u2019s a lot more to do in 1,000 Islands than just cruise around. There is a plethora of outdoor activities of varying levels of intensity, available for everyone to partake in. Alongside the obligatory boating, swimming and paddling, try cycling the 1,000 Islands Parkway Trail in summer \u2013 a glorious, winding 24-mile stretch skirting the coves and bays between Gananoque and Brockville. Meanwhile, the cooler months bring with them a whole array of new activities, from hiking the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2YzxFCV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marble Rock conservation area</a> to high-octane snowmobile runs through the island backcountry.</p> <h2><strong>Prince Edward County</strong></h2> <p>Less than two-and-a-half hours east from the hustle of Toronto, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2KoF1UT\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prince Edward County</a> is an idyllic escape on Lake Ontario.

A permanent home for almost 25,000 people, the county opens its arms to visitors who come for its mix of natural beauty, endless action options and one of the most happening artisanal food and drink scenes in Canada.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff1d836e39de9a8b97d79706e63ecb1d7b0e7ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff1d836e39de9a8b97d79706e63ecb1d7b0e7ecc/0_0_2310_1106/1000.png\" alt=\"Picture of horses in Prince Edward County.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Edward County.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cole Burston/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0705fd1a2dd6ed3bcd1a5a2b1af88187999bc722\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0705fd1a2dd6ed3bcd1a5a2b1af88187999bc722/0_0_2310_1095/1000.png\" alt=\"Picture of a couple looking at a lake and wildlife in Prince Edward County.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"474\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Edward County.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cole Burston/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Prince Edward County</p></li> </ul> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2YwM1YU\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sandbanks</a> provincial park is the undoubted star of the county, a sprawling natural expanse that connects three beaches and ranks as the world\u2019s largest freshwater sand bar and dune system.

There are plenty of great options for canoeing, kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding, as well as angling and boating trips and tours aplenty. But for a truly wild thrill, try flyboarding, the newest adrenaline rush available on water. Think of a flyboard as a water-powered jetpack for your feet. It sucks the water from the wake of a boat or jetski through an 18-metre hose and propels you high up over the lake. If it sounds unbelievable, just try it for yourself in Muskoka.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b5fc76d97745dcb9c349e1736de7b6f1947421d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b5fc76d97745dcb9c349e1736de7b6f1947421d/0_144_2160_1296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A steamer ship cruising on a Muskoka lake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Muskoka region is famous for its lakes and North America\u2019s oldest operating steam ship cruise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Onatrio HANDOUT/PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The Muskoka region is famous for its lakes and North America\u2019s oldest operating steam ship cruise</p></li> </ul> <p>Back on dry land, step up your adventure settings with a visit to Muskoka Zip Lines and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2YCAU0l\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aerial Park</a>.

In the summer months, just 10 minutes from the resort is a private beach on the shores of Georgian Bay, where visitors can surf, and rent boats, canoes, kayaks and paddleboards, alongside other fun, family friendly activities on shore, from the Timber Challenge High Ropes Course to the Ridge Runner Mountain Coaster. Of course, when you\u2019re ready to take things down a gear or two, the resort\u2019s pedestrian-friendly village has a fantastic offering of restaurants, bars and pubs, as well as a great entertainment programme featuring live music and other events such as Movies Under the Stars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66535ca9c7f5d0d6a88950ace82fe37403f5d91b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66535ca9c7f5d0d6a88950ace82fe37403f5d91b/0_179_2701_1621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of Georgian Bay near the Blue Mountain resort.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georgian Bay near the Blue Mountain resort.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Georgian Bay near the Blue Mountain resort</p></li> </ul> <p>There\u2019s also the perfect excuse to seriously chill at the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2YKVJqQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scandinave Spa Blue Mountain</a>.

Algonquin is home to dozens of lakes and small tributaries, and while some of them are only accessible through the backcountry, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2YCAtDk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Algonquin Outfitters</a> offers a number of excursions, from wildlife spotting day trips to canoeing. You could also try <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2YDsHsT\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parkbus</a>, a fantastic and sustainable transport service that ensures city dwellers and tourists can fully connect with nature.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt is wonderful to feel the grandness of Canada in the raw,\u201d wrote Emily Carr, an icon of 20th-century Canadian art, whose vibrant landscape works charted the colours and shapes of the country more evocatively than any before \u2013 or since. To speak of this grandness in the raw is to speak of Ontario, the country\u2019s most populous province. Long before the 14 million who now call Ontario home got here, the place was shaped forever by glacial erosion that gouged and quarried so much of the land that falls within the province\u2019s boundaries. The result left Ontario with upwards of 250,000 lakes, and while the province boasts Canada\u2019s largest city in Toronto and its capital city in Ottawa, it is away from the urban centres that it truly offers itself as a paradise for nature lovers. Ontario is a place for all comers and all seasons. Adventure arrives adrenaline soaked or at a much slower pace \u2026 with plenty of options in between. And the best of those options usually come on, or at least very near, a body of water. In the rustic cabins and cottages that hug every one of those quarter of a million lakes, kitschy slogan wall hangings are ubiquitous, but the advice they offer is nothing if not accurate: \u201cLife is better at the lake.\u201d 1,000 Islands Head downstream from Lake Ontario to the mouth of the mighty St Lawrence River and you\u2019ll reach 1,000 Islands, an archipelago of more than 1,800 islands that straddle the Canadian and US border. Cruise the islands from Kingston, Gananoque or Rockport all the way up the St Lawrence to take in stunning seasonal views. And yes, these same islands are forever commemorated in a condiment \u2013 the eponymous salad dressing originates from these parts. The 1,000 Islands are perfect for outdoor activities, on land and water But of course there\u2019s a lot more to do in 1,000 Islands than just cruise around. There is a plethora of outdoor activities of varying levels of intensity, available for everyone to partake in. Alongside the obligatory boating, swimming and paddling, try cycling the 1,000 Islands Parkway Trail in summer \u2013 a glorious, winding 24-mile stretch skirting the coves and bays between Gananoque and Brockville. Meanwhile, the cooler months bring with them a whole array of new activities, from hiking the Marble Rock conservation area to high-octane snowmobile runs through the island backcountry. Prince Edward County Less than two-and-a-half hours east from the hustle of Toronto, Prince Edward County is an idyllic escape on Lake Ontario. Technically an island, it juts out into the eastern corner of the lake near the head of the St Lawrence River. A permanent home for almost 25,000 people, the county opens its arms to visitors who come for its mix of natural beauty, endless action options and one of the most happening artisanal food and drink scenes in Canada. Prince Edward County Sandbanks provincial park is the undoubted star of the county, a sprawling natural expanse that connects three beaches and ranks as the world\u2019s largest freshwater sand bar and dune system. Hiking trails crisscross the park and the pristine waters are perfect for a dip in summer. But don\u2019t be afraid to take things up a notch nearby (especially when the breeze picks up) with some kiteboarding and sailing lessons under the expert tutelage of the AirTime Kiteboarding team. Canoe and kayak rental options abound too. Sandbanks provincial park\u2019s pristine waters are perfect for a dip No matter what you\u2019ve been getting up to, it\u2019s not difficult to work up an appetite in the county. The best way to do so might well be by first quenching your thirst on two wheels. Cycle-and-sip tours of the island\u2019s up-and-coming wineries are outrageously good fun. But don\u2019t miss out on the brewery scene either (the area is renowned for its ciders), with Midtown and Parsons being the pick of the bunch. Stop off at one of the county\u2019s wineries or breweries for a tasting session Picton, the island\u2019s main hub is full of excellent dining and drinking options such as Hartley\u2019s Tavern and 555 Brewing Co, but perhaps the biggest name around is the Drake Devonshire, located in the nearby waterfront town of Wellington. Billing itself as the ultra-hip country sister to its iconic downtown Toronto original, the Drake Devonshire delivers just as consistently as its urban sibling when it comes to the kitchen. Splurge and stay overnight at one of its unique rooms where every artsy detail is obsessed over. The Drake team also recently opened a more cost-conscious \u2013 but still cool \u2013 option next door with their Motor Inn. Muskoka Meanwhile, the nearby Muskoka region \u2013 or as Ontarians call it, \u201ccottage country\u201d \u2013 is both a relaxation and outdoor adventure hub. The region is, like so many others in Ontario, famous for its lakes \u2013 and there\u2019s no shortage of action to be had out on the water or hugging the shoreline. There are plenty of great options for canoeing, kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding, as well as angling and boating trips and tours aplenty. But for a truly wild thrill, try flyboarding, the newest adrenaline rush available on water. Think of a flyboard as a water-powered jetpack for your feet. It sucks the water from the wake of a boat or jetski through an 18-metre hose and propels you high up over the lake. If it sounds unbelievable, just try it for yourself in Muskoka. The Muskoka region is famous for its lakes and North America\u2019s oldest operating steam ship cruise Back on dry land, step up your adventure settings with a visit to Muskoka Zip Lines and Aerial Park. Clamber over rope bridges and obstacles in the treetop aerial adventure course, or take the zip line canopy tour crisscrossing the park for a fast and fun high-altitude thrill over seven connected zip lines. For those inclined to keep their feet a bit closer to solid ground, take a horseback trail ride with Winding Fences Farm across the beautiful open terrain in the pastures surrounding the town of Windermere. Those looking for an all-frills, all-inclusive experience will find it at the JW Marriott The Rosseau Muskoka. Not only is this luxury resort and spa considered one of Canada\u2019s finest, but its outdoor adventure options include stand-up paddleboarding, canoeing and kayaking from its exclusive lakeside beach, as well as a spectacular new 180-metre zipline that runs across the Five Bridges Trail on the resort\u2019s grounds. Blue Mountain Ontario\u2019s adrenaline hotspot \u2013 the Blue Mountain resort, which not only boasts the province\u2019s best winter sports but an amazing variety of activities the other nine months of the year \u2013 sits on the shores of another of the Great Lakes, Lake Huron. In the summer months, just 10 minutes from the resort is a private beach on the shores of Georgian Bay, where visitors can surf, and rent boats, canoes, kayaks and paddleboards, alongside other fun, family friendly activities on shore, from the Timber Challenge High Ropes Course to the Ridge Runner Mountain Coaster. Of course, when you\u2019re ready to take things down a gear or two, the resort\u2019s pedestrian-friendly village has a fantastic offering of restaurants, bars and pubs, as well as a great entertainment programme featuring live music and other events such as Movies Under the Stars. Georgian Bay near the Blue Mountain resort There\u2019s also the perfect excuse to seriously chill at the Scandinave Spa Blue Mountain. Located in a tranquil forest, the spa has a strict \u201cno electronic devices\u201d policy to ensure maximum unwind time. But when you\u2019re basking in thermal and Nordic waterfalls, hot baths and Finnish and infrared saunas, why would you want to be thinking about the outside world anyway? Algonquin provincial park While no trip to Ontario could be considered complete without at least one trek through Algonquin provincial park in search of that blessed moose, or (from a distance) bear sighting, during the summer months fun on the water takes centre stage. Algonquin is home to dozens of lakes and small tributaries, and while some of them are only accessible through the backcountry, Algonquin Outfitters offers a number of excursions, from wildlife spotting day trips to canoeing. You could also try Parkbus, a fantastic and sustainable transport service that ensures city dwellers and tourists can fully connect with nature. Stops in Algonquin include paddlers\u2019 paradise, Lake Opeongo and the serene Pog Lake. Algonquin provincial park Go your own way Of course it\u2019s not just about the resort towns and big name outdoor destinations, there are plenty of adventures to be had throughout cottage country \u2013 with ample options to hike, get out on the water or just generally unwind. From Haliburton to Huntsville and south to Gravenhurst, there are local gems with water access for lazy morning kayaking and nearby trails for afternoon hikes. And for those who really want to get away from it all, Cabinscape offers tiny custom-made, ecologically friendly cabins perched in the wilderness of southern Ontario \u2013 and some of the options are so off-grid that they\u2019re hike-in access only. But much like the wider province itself, it\u2019s the far-off corners that reveal Ontario\u2019s true character \u2013 a little rugged, a little wild, altogether unforgettable.

The data shows the number of EU citizens arriving in the UK has continued to fall since 2016, mainly because of a decline in people coming to the country for work, the ONS said. In the year ending in March, EU immigration was estimated to be 200,000. This is the lowest since the year ending June 2013, when it was an estimated 183,000. The fall in EU immigration is the main reason for the low level of net EU migration \u2013 the difference between the number of those arriving in the UK and the number leaving, not including UK citizens \u2013 which at 59,000 is less than a third of its peak level of 219,000 in the year ending March 2015. The figures show that 52,000 more UK citizens left the country than returned home. The figures have been released at a time of intense debate over freedom of movement, as the home secretary, Priti Patel, plans to bring it to an abrupt end in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Matthew Fell, the CBI\u2019s chief UK policy director, said: \u201cThe downward trend in EU net migration in the last couple of years, combined with record low unemployment, means that skills shortages are getting worse. \u201cBusiness understands that free movement is ending, but it marks a huge change in the way firms access skills and labour. They will need proper time to adapt to a new system. \u201cThe announcement that free movement will end immediately in a \u2018no deal\u2019 has left employers and their employees asking fundamental questions about what this means for them. They urgently need this clarified.\u201d For net migration outside the EU, an estimated 219,000 more non-EU citizens moved to the UK than left in the year ending March 2019.",

Triumphant, guttural and faintly unhinged, it\u2019s the kind that suggests arena-sized excess, permed mullets and peacocking masculinity. That it is delivered by a woman, the band\u2019s commanding and pleasingly rough-around-the-edges vocalist Tina Halladay, is the first clue that this almost comically retro mashup of hard rock and power pop may not be an entirely straightforward historical re-enactment. In fact, it soon becomes apparent that the swaggeringly macho and viscerally gleeful sonic palate is going to be taken well outside its comfort zone, because A Distant Call is an album with a sombre and timely purpose: to parse the way global-scale tragedy intersects with deeply personal pain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e2b710c69b4ee5583918339e8e49b66df19c8f37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2b710c69b4ee5583918339e8e49b66df19c8f37/0_0_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheer Mag: A Distant Call album art work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheer Mag: A Distant Call album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can trace this intimate take on the horrors of history back to Sheer Mag\u2019s celebrated 2017 debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/13/sheer-mag-need-to-feel-your-love-review-static-shock\">Need to Feel Your Love</a>, on which the group noted the continued psychic imprint of 20th-century injustice \u2013 from the inhumane treatment of LGBTQ people (told via an impressionistic remembering of the Stonewall riots) to the execution of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/27/the-strike-leader-the-singer-and-the-anti-nazi-activist-role-models-for-resistance\">21-year-old anti-Nazi activist Sophie Scholl</a>. The latter seemed as much an exercise in ethics as a pop song: amid leisurely soft rock, it saw Halladay sit unflinchingly with the brutality of Scholl\u2019s death, imagining details like the temperature of the blade that killed her, while maintaining a dogged hope that her death was not in vain.</p> <p>This time round, Sheer Mag are ready to look present-day societal turmoil in the eye, interweaving grand disaster with small-scale sadness. Unfound Manifest mulls over the refugee crisis, before pulling back to reveal its protagonist bedridden by a depressive episode that is partly fuelled by the untold awfulness of the news cycle. Silver Line sees her consider her own unemployment alongside teacher strikes in West Virginia, while The Right Stuff stridently denounces fat-shaming culture with a sardonic request: \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about my health / Shut your mouth and keep it to yourself.\u201d Yet towards the album\u2019s end, some hope glimmers: western governments may have spent the last century conspiring to extinguish socialism in all its forms (or so says The Killer), but \u2013 according to Chopping Block \u2013 a workers\u2019 uprising could still deliver salvation.</p> <p>This is an album with an earnest, intricately woven and gravely serious narrative. Yet the laboured-over lyrics are offset by tunes that have only one thing on their minds: instant gratification. Whether songs lean more towards grimy proto-metal (Chopping Block) or chiming 1970s soft rock (Silver Line), every one is underpinned by a sense of elation designed to deliver you on to the dancefloor, or into the thick of the moshpit \u2013 or at least have you foot-tapping. Halladay\u2019s rich but slightly strained singing voice brings to mind somebody drunkenly performing their favourite song at karaoke, and it can be hard to resist joining in, especially when that sense of enthusiastic abandon extends to everything else: the parping riffs, the drum flourishes, the tongue-in-cheek backing vocals. As with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/nov/23/features.review\">School of Rock</a>, the Richard Linklater film that celebrated bands such as AC/DC, Led Zeppelin and the Who through the eyes of a group of guileless children, the fact that Sheer Mag have removed classic rock from its sometimes grotty context (groupies, drugs, male entitlement) means they are able to produce a sound that is straightforwardly jubilant \u2013 the source of a pure, almost elemental joy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2ZEutg3oZk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z2ZEutg3oZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Sheer Mag: Hardly to Blame \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet at times, the contrast between the grim realism of the lyrics and the euphoric rock nostalgia can tip over into incongruity. On Need to Feel Your Love, the medium isn\u2019t entirely dissimilar \u2013 a lo-fi melange of chugging garage, funk, soul and hard rock \u2013 but it feels raw and desperate simply by dint of its lack of polish. Here, there is occasional scuzz, but the resounding impression is of a gleaming, squealing rock machine. Blood from a Stone is about the grind of food stamp-level poverty, yet the track, with its twanging, countrified guitar and soulful strut, scans as pure positivity. On Cold Sword, a particularly gruelling exploration of feelings of ambivalence in the wake of an abusive father\u2019s death, the buoyant cheer of the music is hard to square with the story.</p> <p>Ultimately, Halladay and co are treading the line every modern artist must if they want to make work that is relevant and instinctively appealing: refusing to shy away from the realities of our political hellscape, but also sugar-coating that righteous indignation with something consolatory and escapist is a dichotomy that is coming to define much of present-day pop culture. A Distant Call may contain some jarring juxtapositions, but on the whole it\u2019s a welcome opportunity for Sheer Mag to prove that serious idealism and infectious fun can \u2013 and should \u2013 harmoniously coexist.</p> <h2>This week Rachel listened to</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/kanoofficial/class-of-deja-feat-d-double-e\">Kano ft D Double E &amp; Ghetts: Class of Deja</a><br></strong>The inimitable east London MC furiously re-asserts his old-school grime credentials on this brilliantly bassy ode to pirate radio station <a href=\"https://dejavufm.com/\">Deja Vu FM</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This story was amended on 22 August 2019 to change the word \u201cgalling\u201d to \u201cgruelling\u201d.</p>",

That it is delivered by a woman, the band\u2019s commanding and pleasingly rough-around-the-edges vocalist Tina Halladay, is the first clue that this almost comically retro mashup of hard rock and power pop may not be an entirely straightforward historical re-enactment. In fact, it soon becomes apparent that the swaggeringly macho and viscerally gleeful sonic palate is going to be taken well outside its comfort zone, because A Distant Call is an album with a sombre and timely purpose: to parse the way global-scale tragedy intersects with deeply personal pain. You can trace this intimate take on the horrors of history back to Sheer Mag\u2019s celebrated 2017 debut, Need to Feel Your Love, on which the group noted the continued psychic imprint of 20th-century injustice \u2013 from the inhumane treatment of LGBTQ people (told via an impressionistic remembering of the Stonewall riots) to the execution of 21-year-old anti-Nazi activist Sophie Scholl. The latter seemed as much an exercise in ethics as a pop song: amid leisurely soft rock, it saw Halladay sit unflinchingly with the brutality of Scholl\u2019s death, imagining details like the temperature of the blade that killed her, while maintaining a dogged hope that her death was not in vain. This time round, Sheer Mag are ready to look present-day societal turmoil in the eye, interweaving grand disaster with small-scale sadness. Unfound Manifest mulls over the refugee crisis, before pulling back to reveal its protagonist bedridden by a depressive episode that is partly fuelled by the untold awfulness of the news cycle. Silver Line sees her consider her own unemployment alongside teacher strikes in West Virginia, while The Right Stuff stridently denounces fat-shaming culture with a sardonic request: \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about my health / Shut your mouth and keep it to yourself.\u201d Yet towards the album\u2019s end, some hope glimmers: western governments may have spent the last century conspiring to extinguish socialism in all its forms (or so says The Killer), but \u2013 according to Chopping Block \u2013 a workers\u2019 uprising could still deliver salvation. This is an album with an earnest, intricately woven and gravely serious narrative. Yet the laboured-over lyrics are offset by tunes that have only one thing on their minds: instant gratification. Whether songs lean more towards grimy proto-metal (Chopping Block) or chiming 1970s soft rock (Silver Line), every one is underpinned by a sense of elation designed to deliver you on to the dancefloor, or into the thick of the moshpit \u2013 or at least have you foot-tapping. Halladay\u2019s rich but slightly strained singing voice brings to mind somebody drunkenly performing their favourite song at karaoke, and it can be hard to resist joining in, especially when that sense of enthusiastic abandon extends to everything else: the parping riffs, the drum flourishes, the tongue-in-cheek backing vocals. As with School of Rock, the Richard Linklater film that celebrated bands such as AC/DC, Led Zeppelin and the Who through the eyes of a group of guileless children, the fact that Sheer Mag have removed classic rock from its sometimes grotty context (groupies, drugs, male entitlement) means they are able to produce a sound that is straightforwardly jubilant \u2013 the source of a pure, almost elemental joy. Yet at times, the contrast between the grim realism of the lyrics and the euphoric rock nostalgia can tip over into incongruity. On Need to Feel Your Love, the medium isn\u2019t entirely dissimilar \u2013 a lo-fi melange of chugging garage, funk, soul and hard rock \u2013 but it feels raw and desperate simply by dint of its lack of polish. Here, there is occasional scuzz, but the resounding impression is of a gleaming, squealing rock machine. Blood from a Stone is about the grind of food stamp-level poverty, yet the track, with its twanging, countrified guitar and soulful strut, scans as pure positivity. On Cold Sword, a particularly gruelling exploration of feelings of ambivalence in the wake of an abusive father\u2019s death, the buoyant cheer of the music is hard to square with the story. Ultimately, Halladay and co are treading the line every modern artist must if they want to make work that is relevant and instinctively appealing: refusing to shy away from the realities of our political hellscape, but also sugar-coating that righteous indignation with something consolatory and escapist is a dichotomy that is coming to define much of present-day pop culture. A Distant Call may contain some jarring juxtapositions, but on the whole it\u2019s a welcome opportunity for Sheer Mag to prove that serious idealism and infectious fun can \u2013 and should \u2013 harmoniously coexist. This week Rachel listened to Kano ft D Double E &amp; Ghetts: Class of Deja The inimitable east London MC furiously re-asserts his old-school grime credentials on this brilliantly bassy ode to pirate radio station Deja Vu FM. \u2022 This story was amended on 22 August 2019 to change the word \u201cgalling\u201d to \u201cgruelling\u201d.",

The atmospheric original \u2013 featuring a supremely creepy choral score and a young Linda Hamilton having a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/03/midsommar-review-ari-aster-florence-pugh\" title=\"\">Midsommar</a> moment \u2013 is the best of a mostly rotten crop.</p> \n<h2><strong>17. Creepshow (1982)</strong></h2> \n<p>This exuberant horror anthology, styled as a disreputable comic, features five tales of cosmic comeuppance scripted by King and directed by the zombie overlord <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/17/george-a-romero-director-night-of-the-living-dead-zombies\" title=\"\">George A Romero</a>. One of its greatest delights is King\u2019s extended cameo as an unlucky hillbilly transmogrifying into a mossy mutant, an appropriate metaphor for his fecund imagination.</p> \n<h2><strong>16. The Night Flier (1997)</strong></h2> \n<p>Originally debuting on HBO before a negligible cinema release, this cheap chiller based on a King short story is worth tracking down for Miguel Ferrer\u2019s ferocious performance. The RoboCop star plays a needlessly combative tabloid hack who takes to the skies to hunt for a bloodthirsty airborne serial killer.</p> \n<h2><strong>15. Pet Sematary (2019)</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d1dbd2d7358ac7c243288b42ccf1740a55b9f1d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d1dbd2d7358ac7c243288b42ccf1740a55b9f1d/0_219_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recent advances in creepy cat makeup \u2026 Pet Sematary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recent advances in creepy cat makeup \u2026 Pet Sematary.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount Pictures</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Fur good or ill, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/21/pet-sematary-review-lairy-hairy-new-version-of-stephen-kings-undead-animal-shocker\" title=\"\">this earthy adaptation</a> of one of King\u2019s most upsetting novels messes with audience\u2019s memories of the previous 1989 movie. But the story of a young family attempting to reverse tragedy with the help of an unholy burial ground retains a gut-churning charge, and clearly benefits from recent advances in creepy cat makeup.</p> \n<h2><strong>14. The Green Mile (1999)</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35018a46089487f6f9861ebf7d9652adf4052c41\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35018a46089487f6f9861ebf7d9652adf4052c41/0_0_2311_1794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A textured tearjerker \u2026 The Green Mile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A textured tearjerker \u2026 The Green Mile.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After expanding King\u2019s novella <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/aug/22/film\" title=\"\">The Shawshank Redemption</a>, the writer/director Frank Darabont went even bigger with another of the author\u2019s old-timey prison tales, originally published in serial form. At a leisurely three hours, The Green Mile is a textured tearjerker that finds magical realism on death row in 1930s Louisiana, with prison guard Tom Hanks looking increasingly anguished as Michael Clarke Duncan\u2019s gentle but doomed inmate symbolically absorbs the pain of his captors.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2019/jan/15/the-prince-of-punching-up-why-stephen-king-rules-twitter\">The prince of punching up: why Stephen King rules Twitter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>13. Dolores Claiborne (1995)</strong></h2> \n<p>No ghouls or demons for a change, but a real-life monster still lurks at the heart of King\u2019s 1992 bestseller, written as one continuous screed to mimic the testimony of its title character. Kathy Bates is terrific as the flinty carer suspected of murdering her well-off charge; the intervention of her estranged journalist daughter (Jennifer Jason Leigh) triggers flashbacks to their traumatic shared past. The caustic back-and-forth between mother and daughter anchors Taylor Hackford\u2019s resonant drama, skilfully adapted for the screen by Tony Gilroy.</p> \n<h2><strong>12. Christine (1983)</strong></h2> \n<p>Blood and chrome: Christine is a sentient, supernatural 1958 Plymouth Fury with the power to turn her dweeby owner Keith Gordon into a pomaded dreamboat \u2013 plus a killer jealous streak. This bloody coming-of-age tale takes a while to shift into high gear, but the director, John Carpenter, crafts some memorable images from King\u2019s slightly daft source material, notably a flaming Christine bearing down on a fleeing greaser on a lonely country road.</p> \n<h2><strong>11. The Running Man (1987)</strong></h2> \n<p>This enjoyably wham-bam sci-fi satire is an adaptation of a quickie King novel \u2013 written under his pseudonym Richard Bachman \u2013 that bins most of the plot except the juicy premise: in the near-future, a lethal, rigged TV manhunt distracts the masses while the elites live it up. Schwarzenegger is the freedom fighter who looks indomitable even in yellow spandex while real-life US gameshow host Richard Dawson brings some authentic smarm as the villain.</p> \n<h2><strong>10. Gerald\u2019s Game (2017)</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07676d61630bf2a46e6dae84fd40c56b90e7fa24\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07676d61630bf2a46e6dae84fd40c56b90e7fa24/0_146_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Role-play goes awry \u2026 Gerald\u2019s Game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Role-play goes awry \u2026 Gerald\u2019s Game.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glen Wilson/Allstar/Intrepid Pictures/Netflix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Looking back, 2017 was a feast of Stephen: a cinematic King love-in with ballooning highs (the runaway success of It) and whoopee-cushion lows (the shrug that greeted would-be epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/03/the-dark-tower-review-interminable-stephen-king-adaptation-a-uniquely-flavorless-slog\" title=\"\">The Dark Tower</a>). Amid those extremes, Gerald\u2019s Game \u2013 one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/19/1922-review-netflix-stephen-king-thomas-jane\" title=\"\">two King movies</a> released that year by Netflix \u2013 got a little lost in the shuffle. Essentially, it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/28/127-hours-danny-boyle-review\" title=\"\">127 Hours</a> with added Viagra: Carla Gugino is left handcuffed to a bed in a remote love nest after some role-play with her husband goes awry. The slap-and-tickle set-up swiftly becomes a claustrophobic life-or-death struggle, with the never-better Gugino digging deep through past trauma to find the means to survive.</p> \n<h2><strong>9. The Mist (2007)</strong></h2> \n<p>Writer/director Frank Darabont\u2019s third (and most recent) King adaptation swaps the golden-hued past of The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption for something far more contemporary played out in shades of grey. Big-city artist Thomas Jane and his son are trapped in a small-town supermarket when an unearthly mist rolls in. If the fog is obscuring nightmarish tentacle-monsters outside, things are not much better within, where a microcosm of US society rapidly fractures into volatile tribal factions. The critical response was muted on release \u2013 perhaps because of Darabont\u2019s revised ending to the 1980 novella, a wicked kicker that King openly admired \u2013 but it increasingly feels like a prescient modern fable.</p> \n<h2><strong>8. It (2017)</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b7eb0a1f9eeea83d3cef6974d6d583e31b75043\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b7eb0a1f9eeea83d3cef6974d6d583e31b75043/93_0_2815_1689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the most successful horror films of all time \u2026 It, with Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Pennywise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the most successful horror films of all time \u2026 It, with Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Pennywise.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/New Line Cinema</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>How to explain the runaway success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/06/it-review-film-scary-stephen-king-horror-clown-haunted\" title=\"\">It</a>, one of the most successful horror films of all time, making $700m worldwide? King\u2019s bestselling 1,100-page whopper of a book and the 1990 TV mini-series helped elevate shape-shifting killer clown Pennywise into a potent cultural bogeyman. But the decision to chop the novel\u2019s cross-cutting timelines into two discrete chunks probably helped, too. Argentinian director Andy Muschietti delivered a well-crafted ghost train of slick, disorientating shocks against an evocative 1980s backdrop. Now all he has to do is repeat the trick without the Stranger Things trappings for the looming sequel, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xhJ5P7Up3jA\" title=\"\">Chapter Two</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>7. 1408 (2007)</strong></h2> \n<p>In this inventive chamber piece \u2013 originally a King audiobook short story \u2013 John Cusack plays a failed novelist turned paranormal debunker surveying supposedly haunted B&amp;Bs. Lured to a grand old NYC hotel by a mysterious postcard, he insists on staying in accursed room 1408 despite grave warnings from the dapper manager, Samuel L Jackson. That Cusack\u2019s wise-ass cynic will get rattled and unravel is a given. What is impressive is the visual panache that, with the logic of a dream, slowly turns an ordinary-looking room into a phantasmagorical apocalypse.</p> \n<h2><strong>6. Stand By Me (1986)</strong></h2> \n<p>\u201cDo you guys wanna go see a dead body?\u201d King\u2019s novella about a hardscrabble young gang trying to kill time during the holidays by embarking on a questionable quest ended up being directed by Rob Reiner. The Spinal Tap man coaxed winning performances from his fresh-faced ensemble, notably River Phoenix\u2019s soulful scrapper. Despite the occasional diversion into mass puking, the movie is infused with such heart and warmth that it has become a touchstone for almost every smalltown lazy-summer tale since. Reiner even wraps it all up in 90 minutes, adding to the sense of something ineffable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/08/readers-favourite-coming-of-age-films-stand-by-me-mean-girls\" title=\"\">gone too soon</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. Misery (1990)</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a82d15a46c8c18006554a60d842802eb380041f1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a82d15a46c8c18006554a60d842802eb380041f1/0_94_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tightly orchestrated battle of wills \u2026 Misery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tightly orchestrated battle of wills \u2026 Misery.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Castle Rock Entertainment</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hammer time: Reiner took another rather less heartwarming shot at adapting King with this suspenseful thriller. James Caan is the mangled author who wakes up after a snowy car crash to find himself being nursed by Kathy Bates\u2019s attentive fan who, despite her perky exterior, takes a rather dim view of his plans to kill off her favourite character. It is a tightly orchestrated battle of wills with one rightly infamous scene of anti-surgery. Bates deservedly won an Oscar, but Caan \u2013 usually Hollywood\u2019s most capable bruiser \u2013 is great, too.</p> \n<h2><strong>4. The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</strong></h2> \n<p>King\u2019s original novella about a seemingly mild-mannered banker imprisoned in 1948 for a double murder was all about playing the long game. So it seems appropriate that it took a decade or so for Darabont\u2019s well-appointed adaptation (evocatively shot by Roger Deakins) to creep up the IMDb rankings to reach the giddiest heights of all-time best film polls. The abuses that Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) endures in Shawshank Penitentiary over almost two decades seem all too real and relatable, but they also make his victories \u2013 one particularly operatic \u2013 seem all the sweeter.</p> \n<h2><strong>3. The Shining (1980)</strong></h2> \n<p>Stanley Kubrick\u2019s poised and chilly adaptation of King\u2019s third novel is literally a cult movie: the 2012 documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/25/room-237-review\" title=\"\">Room 237</a> profiled the fans and theorists who have pored over its meticulous production design for clues to some higher truth. It is certainly the most heightened of slashers, hacking a route into our collective consciousness thanks to Jack Nicholson\u2019s feral performance. For years, King apparently hated it, but has belatedly brought Stanley in from the cold: his 2013 novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/25/doctor-sleep-stephen-king-review\" title=\"\">Doctor Sleep</a> is a sequel to both his 1977 novel and Kubrick\u2019s version (with its own movie <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2msJTFvhkU4\" title=\"\">due this Halloween</a>).</p> \n<h2><strong>2. Carrie (1976)</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5139660a13ce925328ca573140845a4107743ba4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5139660a13ce925328ca573140845a4107743ba4/0_10_840_504/500.jpg\" alt=\"De Palma\u2019s bloody blowout \u2026 Carrie.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">De Palma\u2019s bloody blowout \u2026 Carrie.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It didn\u2019t take long for Hollywood to realise the prolific King was the equivalent of discovering a new oil field when it came to horror movies: his debut novel was in cinemas within two years of publication. Brian De Palma turned King\u2019s tale of horrendous high-school bullying and psychokinetic wrath into something like a high-school heist movie, with mean girl Nancy Allen patiently plotting disproportionate revenge against Sissy Spacek\u2019s browbeaten, willowy wallflower. Despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/28/carrie-review\" title=\"\">2013 remake</a>, De Palma\u2019s bloody blowout remains the definitive version.</p> \n<h2><strong>1.

Then an encounter with a rabble-rousing populist politician (Martin Sheen, a long way from The West Wing) fills Johnny\u2019s noggin with a nightmare vision of the future president, and he goes to extreme lengths to prevent nuclear war. Built around Walken\u2019s wistful performance, David Cronenberg\u2019s thriller is patient, understated and \u2013 despite his surgical reputation \u2013 surprisingly warm-hearted, while also being a timeless examination of the age-old quandary: would you kill baby Hitler?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "20. Maximum Overdrive (1986) Cujo arguably has more thrills. Apt Pupil certainly has more chills. But with his sole directorial effort, Stephen King \u2013 that great chronicler of retro Americana \u2013 somehow made the perfect drive-in movie: a silly, slapdash nightmare of murderous vehicles and appliances attacking hysterical patrons (including a bewildered Emilio Estevez) at a truck stop. 19. Secret Window (2004) King gets arguably his prettiest screen surrogate in this slick, twisty thriller about a blocked writer (Johnny Depp) whose favoured lakeside retreat is interrupted by a vengeful rival (John Turturro) in a distinctive hat. The original novella \u2013 adapted and directed by the veteran scriptwriter David Koepp \u2013 perhaps reveals one of King\u2019s own greatest fears: being accused of plagiarism. 18. Children of the Corn (1984) Ban this sickle filth! King\u2019s unsettling short story about a pagan cult of killer kids was originally published in Penthouse in 1977 and has so far inspired 10 screen adaptations. The atmospheric original \u2013 featuring a supremely creepy choral score and a young Linda Hamilton having a Midsommar moment \u2013 is the best of a mostly rotten crop. 17. Creepshow (1982) This exuberant horror anthology, styled as a disreputable comic, features five tales of cosmic comeuppance scripted by King and directed by the zombie overlord George A Romero. One of its greatest delights is King\u2019s extended cameo as an unlucky hillbilly transmogrifying into a mossy mutant, an appropriate metaphor for his fecund imagination. 16. The Night Flier (1997) Originally debuting on HBO before a negligible cinema release, this cheap chiller based on a King short story is worth tracking down for Miguel Ferrer\u2019s ferocious performance. The RoboCop star plays a needlessly combative tabloid hack who takes to the skies to hunt for a bloodthirsty airborne serial killer. 15. Pet Sematary (2019) Fur good or ill, this earthy adaptation of one of King\u2019s most upsetting novels messes with audience\u2019s memories of the previous 1989 movie. But the story of a young family attempting to reverse tragedy with the help of an unholy burial ground retains a gut-churning charge, and clearly benefits from recent advances in creepy cat makeup. 14. The Green Mile (1999) After expanding King\u2019s novella The Shawshank Redemption, the writer/director Frank Darabont went even bigger with another of the author\u2019s old-timey prison tales, originally published in serial form. At a leisurely three hours, The Green Mile is a textured tearjerker that finds magical realism on death row in 1930s Louisiana, with prison guard Tom Hanks looking increasingly anguished as Michael Clarke Duncan\u2019s gentle but doomed inmate symbolically absorbs the pain of his captors. 13. Dolores Claiborne (1995) No ghouls or demons for a change, but a real-life monster still lurks at the heart of King\u2019s 1992 bestseller, written as one continuous screed to mimic the testimony of its title character. Kathy Bates is terrific as the flinty carer suspected of murdering her well-off charge; the intervention of her estranged journalist daughter (Jennifer Jason Leigh) triggers flashbacks to their traumatic shared past. The caustic back-and-forth between mother and daughter anchors Taylor Hackford\u2019s resonant drama, skilfully adapted for the screen by Tony Gilroy. 12. Christine (1983) Blood and chrome: Christine is a sentient, supernatural 1958 Plymouth Fury with the power to turn her dweeby owner Keith Gordon into a pomaded dreamboat \u2013 plus a killer jealous streak. This bloody coming-of-age tale takes a while to shift into high gear, but the director, John Carpenter, crafts some memorable images from King\u2019s slightly daft source material, notably a flaming Christine bearing down on a fleeing greaser on a lonely country road. 11. The Running Man (1987) This enjoyably wham-bam sci-fi satire is an adaptation of a quickie King novel \u2013 written under his pseudonym Richard Bachman \u2013 that bins most of the plot except the juicy premise: in the near-future, a lethal, rigged TV manhunt distracts the masses while the elites live it up. Schwarzenegger is the freedom fighter who looks indomitable even in yellow spandex while real-life US gameshow host Richard Dawson brings some authentic smarm as the villain. 10. Gerald\u2019s Game (2017) Looking back, 2017 was a feast of Stephen: a cinematic King love-in with ballooning highs (the runaway success of It) and whoopee-cushion lows (the shrug that greeted would-be epic The Dark Tower). Amid those extremes, Gerald\u2019s Game \u2013 one of two King movies released that year by Netflix \u2013 got a little lost in the shuffle. Essentially, it is 127 Hours with added Viagra: Carla Gugino is left handcuffed to a bed in a remote love nest after some role-play with her husband goes awry. The slap-and-tickle set-up swiftly becomes a claustrophobic life-or-death struggle, with the never-better Gugino digging deep through past trauma to find the means to survive. 9. The Mist (2007) Writer/director Frank Darabont\u2019s third (and most recent) King adaptation swaps the golden-hued past of The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption for something far more contemporary played out in shades of grey. Big-city artist Thomas Jane and his son are trapped in a small-town supermarket when an unearthly mist rolls in. If the fog is obscuring nightmarish tentacle-monsters outside, things are not much better within, where a microcosm of US society rapidly fractures into volatile tribal factions. The critical response was muted on release \u2013 perhaps because of Darabont\u2019s revised ending to the 1980 novella, a wicked kicker that King openly admired \u2013 but it increasingly feels like a prescient modern fable. 8. It (2017) How to explain the runaway success of It, one of the most successful horror films of all time, making $700m worldwide? King\u2019s bestselling 1,100-page whopper of a book and the 1990 TV mini-series helped elevate shape-shifting killer clown Pennywise into a potent cultural bogeyman. But the decision to chop the novel\u2019s cross-cutting timelines into two discrete chunks probably helped, too. Argentinian director Andy Muschietti delivered a well-crafted ghost train of slick, disorientating shocks against an evocative 1980s backdrop. Now all he has to do is repeat the trick without the Stranger Things trappings for the looming sequel, Chapter Two. 7. 1408 (2007) In this inventive chamber piece \u2013 originally a King audiobook short story \u2013 John Cusack plays a failed novelist turned paranormal debunker surveying supposedly haunted B&amp;Bs. Lured to a grand old NYC hotel by a mysterious postcard, he insists on staying in accursed room 1408 despite grave warnings from the dapper manager, Samuel L Jackson. That Cusack\u2019s wise-ass cynic will get rattled and unravel is a given. What is impressive is the visual panache that, with the logic of a dream, slowly turns an ordinary-looking room into a phantasmagorical apocalypse. 6. Stand By Me (1986) \u201cDo you guys wanna go see a dead body?\u201d King\u2019s novella about a hardscrabble young gang trying to kill time during the holidays by embarking on a questionable quest ended up being directed by Rob Reiner. The Spinal Tap man coaxed winning performances from his fresh-faced ensemble, notably River Phoenix\u2019s soulful scrapper. Despite the occasional diversion into mass puking, the movie is infused with such heart and warmth that it has become a touchstone for almost every smalltown lazy-summer tale since. Reiner even wraps it all up in 90 minutes, adding to the sense of something ineffable gone too soon. 5. Misery (1990) Hammer time: Reiner took another rather less heartwarming shot at adapting King with this suspenseful thriller. James Caan is the mangled author who wakes up after a snowy car crash to find himself being nursed by Kathy Bates\u2019s attentive fan who, despite her perky exterior, takes a rather dim view of his plans to kill off her favourite character. It is a tightly orchestrated battle of wills with one rightly infamous scene of anti-surgery. Bates deservedly won an Oscar, but Caan \u2013 usually Hollywood\u2019s most capable bruiser \u2013 is great, too. 4. The Shawshank Redemption (1994) King\u2019s original novella about a seemingly mild-mannered banker imprisoned in 1948 for a double murder was all about playing the long game. So it seems appropriate that it took a decade or so for Darabont\u2019s well-appointed adaptation (evocatively shot by Roger Deakins) to creep up the IMDb rankings to reach the giddiest heights of all-time best film polls. The abuses that Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) endures in Shawshank Penitentiary over almost two decades seem all too real and relatable, but they also make his victories \u2013 one particularly operatic \u2013 seem all the sweeter. 3. The Shining (1980) Stanley Kubrick\u2019s poised and chilly adaptation of King\u2019s third novel is literally a cult movie: the 2012 documentary Room 237 profiled the fans and theorists who have pored over its meticulous production design for clues to some higher truth. It is certainly the most heightened of slashers, hacking a route into our collective consciousness thanks to Jack Nicholson\u2019s feral performance. For years, King apparently hated it, but has belatedly brought Stanley in from the cold: his 2013 novel Doctor Sleep is a sequel to both his 1977 novel and Kubrick\u2019s version (with its own movie due this Halloween). 2. Carrie (1976) It didn\u2019t take long for Hollywood to realise the prolific King was the equivalent of discovering a new oil field when it came to horror movies: his debut novel was in cinemas within two years of publication. Brian De Palma turned King\u2019s tale of horrendous high-school bullying and psychokinetic wrath into something like a high-school heist movie, with mean girl Nancy Allen patiently plotting disproportionate revenge against Sissy Spacek\u2019s browbeaten, willowy wallflower. Despite the 2013 remake, De Palma\u2019s bloody blowout remains the definitive version. 1. The Dead Zone (1983) When Christopher Walken\u2019s likable everyman Johnny Smith wakes up from a coma, the rest of the world \u2013 including his sweetheart \u2013 has moved on. All he has left is an increasingly frazzled hairstyle and the ability to predict the future through touch. Then an encounter with a rabble-rousing populist politician (Martin Sheen, a long way from The West Wing) fills Johnny\u2019s noggin with a nightmare vision of the future president, and he goes to extreme lengths to prevent nuclear war. Built around Walken\u2019s wistful performance, David Cronenberg\u2019s thriller is patient, understated and \u2013 despite his surgical reputation \u2013 surprisingly warm-hearted, while also being a timeless examination of the age-old quandary: would you kill baby Hitler?",

      "bodyText": "Lara Maiklem is sitting near Cannon Street station in London, sipping a cup of coffee when I arrive \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t want to hang around. The sun is shining, the tide is low and we have an hour blocked out to go hunting for the remains of history on the banks of the Thames. As we head down the steps towards the narrow strip of land, visible only at low tide, the noise of the city drifts away, but for the occasional screech and rattle of faraway trains. No one else is about. In the heart of the capital we have entered a world ruled by the slap of waves, the crunch and scrape of the sand and rubble underfoot. Maiklem was \u201cmudlarking\u201d \u2013 looking for rare objects by the side of a tidal river \u2013 before she\u2019d even heard the word. Now, it\u2019s a form of meditation for her, she says, a time when she can just \u201ccheck out and stop thinking about the builder back at home who hasn\u2019t done what he should have done, or the tenant who\u2019s moving in tomorrow\u201d. Born in 1971, Maiklem grew up in an old farmhouse in Surrey and was always fascinated with the Victorian china, glass bottle stoppers and clay pipe stems she dug out of the garden. After graduating from Newcastle University and moving to London to work in publishing, she found herself going for walks by the river as a way of getting some respite from the frantic city. One day she spotted some steps leading to the water\u2019s edge, climbed down and stumbled across a piece of clay pipe. \u201cWhen I went down on to the foreshore, seeing I could have this amazing open space that felt like I wasn\u2019t in the city, with all this history and all these stories under my feet, it was just \u2026 \u201d she puffs out her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with it. I can\u2019t stop going back.\u201d Her first book, Mudlarking, charts the thousands of years people have been living by the Thames, or on the islands \u2013 many now vanished \u2013 along its meandering course.

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Frederiksen says dispute will not harm \u2018good relationship\u2019 with US The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has said she was surprised and disappointed by Donald Trump\u2019s decision to cancel his visit to Copenhagen, after she dismissed his proposal to buy Greenland as \u201cabsurd\u201d. Other Danes and Greenlanders echoed the sentiment, with one former minister calling the US president a \u201cnarcissistic fool\u201d. Trump said he scotched the trip as he found the Danish leader\u2019s remarks \u201cnasty\u201d, but she insisted her country\u2019s \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the US would be unaffected. Putin\u2019s influence? Richard Wolffe says Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland might originate with Russia, which covets the arctic island\u2019s unknown quantities of oil, gas and minerals. \u2018Chosen One\u2019. On Wednesday, the president doubled down on an antisemitic trope, saying Jewish Americans who voted for Democrats were \u201cdisloyal to Israel\u201d. He also described himself as \u201cthe Chosen One\u201d to fight a trade war with China. US to remove limits on length of migrant child detention The Trump administration has announced plans to eliminate a federal court agreement putting time limits on child detention, allowing the government to hold migrant children with their parents indefinitely. The longstanding Flores agreement says the government must release children as quickly as possible, generally after 20 days. But the administration\u2019s new rule, to be published on Friday, would scrap the time limit and give officials more power to determine the standards of care for families in custody. Birthright citizenship. Trump said on Wednesday that his administration was looking at ending birthright citizenship, saying: \u201cYou walk over the border, have a baby \u2013 congratulations, the baby is now a US citizen ... It\u2019s frankly ridiculous.\u201d Abortion \u2018gag rule\u2019 leaves poor women with \u2018nowhere to go\u2019 Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest reproductive health provider, withdrew this week from Title X \u2013 the federal program which distributes grants to clinics \u2013 over the Trump administration\u2019s new \u201cgag rule\u201d banning clinics from referring patients for abortions. That leaves low-income patients in states such as Utah \u2013 where Planned Parenthood is the sole Title X provider \u2013 with \u201cnowhere to go,\u201d as one Planned Parenthood executives tells Miranda Bryant. The moral choice? Planned Parenthood was right to refuse federal funding, says Moira Donegan. The Trump administration had put the organisation in an untenable position. Anti-abortion voters. A survey shows what really motivates anti-abortionists, argues Jill Filipovic: hostility to gender equality and a desire to control women. Democrats to vote on climate debate as Inslee drops out Jay Inslee, the Washington state governor who sought the Democratic presidential nomination on a platform devoted to tackling the climate crisis, has dropped out of the 2020 race saying it was clear he could not win. Yet his core issue may yet have its day, with the Democratic National Committee due to vote on Thursday as to whether the party\u2019s remaining 2020 candidates ought to take part in an entirely climate-focused televised debate. Mileage standards. Automakers are pushing back against the Trump administration\u2019s loosening environmental rules because they want to be seen as on the right side of the climate crisis \u2013 and to avoid drawn-out court battles they would ultimately lose, a former senior Obama official has said. Crib sheet The US federal deficit is set to reach $1tn in 2020, according to figures released by the Congressional Budget Office. On current projections, the national debt will hit 95% of GDP within 10 years, its highest level since just after the second world war. Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has claimed without evidence that environmental groups are responsible for a series of fires in the Amazon rainforest, suggesting the blazes were set in order to embarrass his government. Officials in southern California have reopened an investigation into a group of Orange County high school students seen giving Nazi salutes on video, following the emergence of further videos showing students at the school engaged in hate speech. Microplastics are increasingly found in drinking water, but there is as yet no evidence that such contamination poses a health risk to humans, a new WHO assessment has concluded. Must-reads The snake epidemic eating away at Florida There are tens of thousands of Burmese pythons in the Florida wild, attacking other large animals and unbalancing ecosystems without a natural predator to stop them \u2013 until now. Lance Richardson joins members of the state\u2019s Python Action Team on the hunt. Trudeau: the rise and fall of a political brand Justin Trudeau resuscitated Canada\u2019s Liberal party and returned it to power in 2015 on the strength of his image as a rising progressive superstar. But with his government now mired in scandal, Ashifa Kassam finds Canadians beginning to see Brand Trudeau as \u201cWelcome to the new politics, just like the old politics\u201d. Can Spider-Man survive outside the MCU? Tom Holland\u2019s friendly, neighbourhood Spider-Man was all set to take Iron Man\u2019s place at the heart of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, until talks between Sony and Disney over the character\u2019s future broke down. Now, as Gretchen Small writes, the web-slinger may be barred from the Avengers altogether. Powerful Democrats face a looming primary threat Inspired by the success of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley in 2018, a group of young, diverse, progressive candidates is challenging senior \u201ccorporate\u201d Democrats for their safely blue congressional seats in 2020, as Lauren Gambino reports.

Far-right violence is on the rise, he says, and the media is oblivious to the hate preachers who fuel it: the politicians and commentators to whom it offers a bullhorn.

These are the conversations that all ears in Brussels will be listening out for.</p> <p>Johnson asserted to Merkel this week that parliament simply <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/back-down-on-the-backstop-or-there-s-no-chance-of-a-deal-johnson-tells-eu-0k0qvwf9j\" title=\"\">couldn\u2019t block a no-deal Brexit</a>. But he isn\u2019t in a position to offer those assurances: that\u2019s up to parliament, not the prime minister. And it\u2019s those conversations between opposition MPs that provide the best chance of avoiding Britain crashing out without a deal on 31 October. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.</p> <p>These cross-party talks are long overdue. Thus far the attempts to take no deal off the table have been led mainly by backbenchers, and the failure to agree on a constructive way forwards means that MPs haven\u2019t yet been able to go beyond simply expressing their will that no deal should not happen. They haven\u2019t taken any definition action to make that a reality. There simply hasn\u2019t been the coordination that would be required between those party leaders who all want the same thing: to stop a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>It may have come late in the day, but Corbyn has now offered a procedurally failsafe route to block no deal, should other MPs choose to back it. MPs would vote against the government in a vote of no confidence, and Corbyn would form a temporary government, with the support of opposition parties and Conservative rebels, whose sole purpose would be securing an article 50 extension, then triggering a general election in which Labour would campaign for a referendum with a remain option.</p> <p>The problem is that Eurosceptic Corbyn is an unlikely leader for a remain resistance: he is distrusted by pro-Europeans such as Jo Swinson, who feel he has been dragged to this position kicking and screaming, and too many MPs who want to avoid no deal say they could never put him in government, even temporarily. But the fact is he\u2019s the leader of the main opposition party, with the best chance of bringing the greatest number of MPs behind him as the anti-no deal temporary prime minister. Swinson and others may not trust his motives \u2013 and believe he\u2019s only made the offer to escape blame if and when no deal happens \u2013 but if stopping no deal matters above all else, why not call his bluff? It\u2019s hard to see sufficient numbers of Labour MPs getting behind Swinson\u2019s suggestion of a backbencher as temporary prime minister, even if it\u2019s someone who comes from their own ranks, such as Harriet Harman.</p> <p>This impasse among remainers means that a temporary government to block no deal feels politically unlikely. Conservative rebels such as Dominic Grieve are working on an alternative plan, which would see parliament take over the legislative agenda in September and pass a bill to mandate Johnson to ask for an extension to article 50. This feels more likely politically, although there are questions about whether it could work procedurally, even with a sympathetic Speaker. If it were to happen, Johnson would likely trigger a general election in order to get a mandate for no deal. If none of that works, there\u2019s also a last nuclear option: parliament could vote to revoke article 50 in the days leading up to 31 October.</p> <p>Johnson is wrong that parliament can\u2019t block no deal. As much as he might wish it away, we still live in a parliamentary democracy, in which parliament is sovereign. But we remain stuck in the position that while there\u2019s a majority of MPs who don\u2019t want no deal to happen, they can\u2019t agree on the constructive action that would be needed to stop it.</p> <p>Will they find it within them to work across party lines \u2013 and with some age-old political enemies \u2013 to do so? The jury is still out. So it\u2019s Westminster where all the important action is happening this August, not in those continental capitals where leaders are politely rehashing for Johnson the same argument that they had with Theresa May for the past two years.</p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha is a Guardian columnist</p>",

MPs would vote against the government in a vote of no confidence, and Corbyn would form a temporary government, with the support of opposition parties and Conservative rebels, whose sole purpose would be securing an article 50 extension, then triggering a general election in which Labour would campaign for a referendum with a remain option. The problem is that Eurosceptic Corbyn is an unlikely leader for a remain resistance: he is distrusted by pro-Europeans such as Jo Swinson, who feel he has been dragged to this position kicking and screaming, and too many MPs who want to avoid no deal say they could never put him in government, even temporarily. But the fact is he\u2019s the leader of the main opposition party, with the best chance of bringing the greatest number of MPs behind him as the anti-no deal temporary prime minister. Swinson and others may not trust his motives \u2013 and believe he\u2019s only made the offer to escape blame if and when no deal happens \u2013 but if stopping no deal matters above all else, why not call his bluff? It\u2019s hard to see sufficient numbers of Labour MPs getting behind Swinson\u2019s suggestion of a backbencher as temporary prime minister, even if it\u2019s someone who comes from their own ranks, such as Harriet Harman. This impasse among remainers means that a temporary government to block no deal feels politically unlikely. Conservative rebels such as Dominic Grieve are working on an alternative plan, which would see parliament take over the legislative agenda in September and pass a bill to mandate Johnson to ask for an extension to article 50. This feels more likely politically, although there are questions about whether it could work procedurally, even with a sympathetic Speaker. If it were to happen, Johnson would likely trigger a general election in order to get a mandate for no deal. If none of that works, there\u2019s also a last nuclear option: parliament could vote to revoke article 50 in the days leading up to 31 October. Johnson is wrong that parliament can\u2019t block no deal. As much as he might wish it away, we still live in a parliamentary democracy, in which parliament is sovereign. But we remain stuck in the position that while there\u2019s a majority of MPs who don\u2019t want no deal to happen, they can\u2019t agree on the constructive action that would be needed to stop it. Will they find it within them to work across party lines \u2013 and with some age-old political enemies \u2013 to do so? The jury is still out. So it\u2019s Westminster where all the important action is happening this August, not in those continental capitals where leaders are politely rehashing for Johnson the same argument that they had with Theresa May for the past two years. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is a Guardian columnist",

He raised a glass to toast Queen Elizabeth while sitting between the Duke of Edinburgh and David Cameron at a state dinner in her honour at Dublin Castle.</p> <p>What changed? After the squalor of the Troubles and the decades of political turmoil, Northern Ireland found a structure capable \u2013 for a while at least \u2013 of accommodating its contradictions. That structure was the Good Friday agreement, which was itself contradictory in that it was designed to enshrine the consent of two groups with opposing aspirations. Unionists were reassured that Northern Ireland would remain in the United Kingdom until a majority voted otherwise. Dublin would remove its territorial claim on Northern Ireland and acknowledge UK sovereignty \u2013 but with Irish consultation written into the governance of the place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"947561ff3f7a6816df083dbd516df0e583b12789\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/947561ff3f7a6816df083dbd516df0e583b12789/229_461_3235_1941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Boris Johnson\u2019s letter to Donald Tusk requests the complete removal of the backstop.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nationalists, whose alienation was in large measure derived from the fact that their consent was never asked for in either the partition of Ireland or the character of Northern Ireland, were given a guaranteed stake in the government via power sharing. The agreement also contained a specific route to future Irish unity via a border poll and permanent citizenship rights \u2013 the right to identify as British, Irish or both.</p> <p>It was, on several levels, a loss of control. But it was rewarded with a strengthening of consent. In a small way, I was an example. I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as a nationalist (or unionist), but I am certainly Irish and carry a passport accordingly \u2013 and did so when working for two different prime ministers. I had a British one, too. I didn\u2019t feel British in a conventional way, but I certainly felt huge respect for the way the British state was able to accommodate people like me.</p> <p>I left the government a while ago now, in part because the contradictions involved \u2013 at least in Brexit policy \u2013 became too stark. For many moderates in Northern Ireland, accepting contradiction has not just been about pragmatism, but ethical choice in the context of a divided society and grim history.</p> <p>By loosening its control of Northern Ireland, the UK solidified the consent of people there for the status quo. Quite an achievement, but one which seems to belong to a different political age, which of course it does. <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/boris-johnson/news/106014/read-full-boris-johnsons\" title=\"\">In his letter to Tusk</a> requesting the complete removal of the backstop, Boris Johnson correctly says that the Good Friday agreement and broader settlement are founded on a \u201cdelicate balance\u201d between two traditions and the principle of consent. But in asserting hard UK sovereignty in Northern Ireland \u2013 as the letter also does \u2013 the government is at risk of undermining the hard-won consent of people who do not rally to the flag in the unambiguous way of the Tories\u2019 Democratic Unionist partners.</p> <p>Most intriguingly, the letter argues that the Good Friday agreement is founded on the protection of \u201cminority rights\u201d. This is a phrase that never appears in the agreement. It implies a decades-old view of Northern Ireland being constructed of a unionist majority and nationalist minority. This is simply no longer true. Unionist parties have not won a majority of votes cast in a Northern Ireland election since 2005. While there is likely still a majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the United Kingdom, this is not the same thing as a \u201cunionist majority\u201d. Both unionism and nationalism are minorities now, with the balance being held by an unaligned, liberal middle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/20/whats-new-in-boris-johnsons-fresh-bid-to-remove-brexit-backstop\">What's new in Johnson's attempt to remove Brexit backstop?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where there is a majority is for the backstop.

It does no such thing.\u201d The senior Brexit strategist went on to describe arguments about the complexity of the Irish question as \u201cbabble\u201d. He may not like the rest of this article. \u201cBe advised, my passport\u2019s green. No glass of ours was ever raised to toast the Queen.\u201d So wrote Seamus Heaney 50 years ago. It remains the most famous statement of sullen Irish nationalist alienation from the British state. But it is also a historical artefact, because in 2011, Heaney did exactly that. He raised a glass to toast Queen Elizabeth while sitting between the Duke of Edinburgh and David Cameron at a state dinner in her honour at Dublin Castle. What changed? After the squalor of the Troubles and the decades of political turmoil, Northern Ireland found a structure capable \u2013 for a while at least \u2013 of accommodating its contradictions. That structure was the Good Friday agreement, which was itself contradictory in that it was designed to enshrine the consent of two groups with opposing aspirations. Unionists were reassured that Northern Ireland would remain in the United Kingdom until a majority voted otherwise. Dublin would remove its territorial claim on Northern Ireland and acknowledge UK sovereignty \u2013 but with Irish consultation written into the governance of the place. Nationalists, whose alienation was in large measure derived from the fact that their consent was never asked for in either the partition of Ireland or the character of Northern Ireland, were given a guaranteed stake in the government via power sharing. The agreement also contained a specific route to future Irish unity via a border poll and permanent citizenship rights \u2013 the right to identify as British, Irish or both. It was, on several levels, a loss of control. But it was rewarded with a strengthening of consent. In a small way, I was an example. I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as a nationalist (or unionist), but I am certainly Irish and carry a passport accordingly \u2013 and did so when working for two different prime ministers. I had a British one, too. I didn\u2019t feel British in a conventional way, but I certainly felt huge respect for the way the British state was able to accommodate people like me. I left the government a while ago now, in part because the contradictions involved \u2013 at least in Brexit policy \u2013 became too stark. For many moderates in Northern Ireland, accepting contradiction has not just been about pragmatism, but ethical choice in the context of a divided society and grim history. By loosening its control of Northern Ireland, the UK solidified the consent of people there for the status quo. Quite an achievement, but one which seems to belong to a different political age, which of course it does. In his letter to Tusk requesting the complete removal of the backstop, Boris Johnson correctly says that the Good Friday agreement and broader settlement are founded on a \u201cdelicate balance\u201d between two traditions and the principle of consent. But in asserting hard UK sovereignty in Northern Ireland \u2013 as the letter also does \u2013 the government is at risk of undermining the hard-won consent of people who do not rally to the flag in the unambiguous way of the Tories\u2019 Democratic Unionist partners. Most intriguingly, the letter argues that the Good Friday agreement is founded on the protection of \u201cminority rights\u201d. This is a phrase that never appears in the agreement. It implies a decades-old view of Northern Ireland being constructed of a unionist majority and nationalist minority. This is simply no longer true. Unionist parties have not won a majority of votes cast in a Northern Ireland election since 2005. While there is likely still a majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the United Kingdom, this is not the same thing as a \u201cunionist majority\u201d. Both unionism and nationalism are minorities now, with the balance being held by an unaligned, liberal middle. Where there is a majority is for the backstop. Successive polls and the European election results indicate nearly 60% consistently voting in favour of special arrangements to accommodate Northern Ireland\u2019s strangeness. We have come to quite the historical pass when a government in Dublin finds itself pointing out that the will of the majority of partitioned Northern Ireland should be respected. Wherever \u00c9amon de Valera and Edward Carson are now, we can only hope they are able to enjoy the irony together. Another irony: that less control can mean more consent seems tragically to have been forgotten, at least in London. \u2022 Matthew O\u2019Toole is a former No 10 Brexit spokesperson",

More recent history lies in the second world war ack-ack gun emplacements, still in good shape, but more and more engulfed by the vegetation every year.

The chalk downlands are the real attraction though, and you have to be prepared to go slow to appreciate its delights \u2013 multitudes of plants, all in flower, just centimetres from each other. The mind boggles at how so many different things can live cheek by jowl. The cherry on the cake isn\u2019t just the song of the skylark, but the clouds of butterflies that erupt with every step. Here I am reminded of Pig-Pen, the character in Charlie Brown, as silver-spotted skipper butterflies surround me in their hundreds. \u2022 gov.uk Rob Millwall Dock, London For a slice of serenity in the heart of London, I love Millwall Dock on the Isle of Dogs. Dwarfed by the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, this expanse of open water is the perfect contrast to fast-paced urban life. Whether it\u2019s observing the mischievous birdlife squabbling over possession of the tern raft in the old graving dock, or partaking in a bracing open-water swim from the Docklands Sailing &amp; Watersports Centre, or simply watching the sun set over the City of London with an array of dinghies in the foreground, there\u2019s always something to amuse, refresh or inspire. And for those more interested in llamas, goats and donkeys, Mudchute Farm is just a stone\u2019s throw away. Jack Stookes Sandwell Valley country park, West Midlands Sandwell Valley, near West Bromwich, is a one-of-a-kind place full of hidden gems, with surviving bits of real countryside, open pastures and grass meadows. It also has a nice old farm turned into a museum and two large, well-equipped playgrounds. Or you can visit the priory ruins \u2013 said to be haunted \u2013 with its Saxon stone coffins, surrounded by old dark woods with hidden medieval ponds. More recent history lies in the second world war ack-ack gun emplacements, still in good shape, but more and more engulfed by the vegetation every year. And an old colliery site has been transformed into a wildlife haven by the RSPB on the river Tame. This is all within a 1.5-mile radius surrounded on all sides by urban sprawl. May it remain undeveloped for ever. \u2022 sandwell.gov.uk Stanley Dalston Eastern Curve Garden, London My absolute favourite green space is the Dalston Eastern Curve Garden. This small urban community oasis is set back from the madness of busy Hackney on a disused train line. It\u2019s a beautifully layered garden with a magical wooded area, raised beds with vegetables, and beautiful pots full of seasonal flowers. The main reason I come here is for inspiration \u2013 I love the creativity, especially across the seasons. I especially love visiting in October: despite the year growing old, it is transformed into a beautiful autumnal space, using the changing plants, hundreds of carved pumpkins, and coppery red crispy leaf garlands. Sitting in the cold, warmed by a hot chocolate, it is just perfect. \u2022 dalstongarden.org Katherine Phipps Williamson Park, Lancaster Williamson Park in Lancaster is a gem. Jimmy Williamson (Lord Ashton) commissioned its construction from the remains of the city quarry in the 19th century. Most people who have passed Lancaster on the M6 heading north will have seen the Ashton Memorial in the centre of the park, rising above the trees, but step inside and you find lovely walks between mature trees, a regular outdoor theatre, cafe, wildlife park, butterfly house, children\u2019s play areas and \u2013 on a clear day \u2013 views across Morecambe Bay to the Lakeland Fells. It\u2019s a hidden wonder much worth the detour. \u2022 see lancaster.gov.uk Karl Lester Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips",

But these plants have been growing out of doors here in the gardens for 15 years, going through their natural cycles.\u201d Cycads are a relic from a time before flowering plants. In its native Japan, Cycas revoluta is believed to be pollinated by beetles. In the botanic garden, the plant with a male cone is some distance from the female and so the pollen is to be transferred by hand in about a week. \u201cBy crossing them and making seed from them we\u2019re doing something that has never been done before in the UK,\u201d said Kidd. \u201cWe see the undercliff here as being a predictor for the wider British landscape in 20 to 30 years time.\u201d Cycad species are composed of three families, the only surviving members of an ancient and largely extinct lineage that has changed little since the Jurassic period, and so are considered \u201cliving fossils\u201d. All cycads are native to warmer parts of the world, but are naturally absent from Europe and Antarctica. Jurassic-era fossils of specimens strikingly similar to the present-day plants have been found on both continents.",

The state attorney general, Jill Hennessy, made the announcement on Thursday night and said she would write to the Victorian coroner, Caitlin English, who is overseeing the three-week inquest into Day\u2019s death, to advise her that the government had committed in principle to abolishing the crime. English warned the government in December that she intended to recommend the law be abolished, and Day\u2019s family has been advocating for the change since her death in December 2017. \u201cPublic drunkenness requires a public health response, not a criminal justice one, and now is the right time to take this important reform forward,\u201d Hennessy said. \u201cThe Andrews Labor government acknowledges the disproportionate impact the current laws have had on Aboriginal people and pay tribute to the community members who have advocated for this change.\u201d Day was arrested and charged with being drunk in public on 5 December 2017, after a V/Line officer called police when she fell asleep on a train from Echuca to Melbourne.

She cited open container laws and aggressive protective custody provisions in other jurisdictions which mean that Aboriginal people were still effectively being arrested for public drunkenness. A relevant case was the death of Day\u2019s uncle, Harrison Day, who had a seizure in the cells of the Echuca police station in 1982 after being arrested for an unpaid fine for being drunk and disorderly. Stevens urged the government to take a \u201chealth and wellbeing based approach\u201d.

The name of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) officer was accidentally published during the routine public release of Annastacia Palaszczuk\u2019s diaries, a practice designed to boost government transparency. One of Palaszczuk\u2019s diaries included details of a meeting between intelligence officials \u2013 including the Asio director general, Duncan Lewis \u2013 and the premier, police minister, and the Queensland police commissioner. The diary entry names a second Asio officer, who the Guardian will not identify, and lists their position within the organisation. The identities of Asio officers are highly sensitive and kept secret to prevent operatives being targeted or compromised, including by foreign powers. Naming an Asio officer without authorisation is a criminal offence that can attract up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. The diary appears to have been available to the public online for at least a month.

      "bodyText": "In Manchester United\u2019s opening two games Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has shown the ruthlessness required to successfully transform the side. The manager is ushering in a vibrant core who made his XI against Chelsea on the opening day the youngest of the weekend \u2013 at an average age of 24 years and 227 days \u2013 and that mark was lowered to 24 years and 173 days at Wolves on Monday. This illustrates a determination from Solskj\u00e6r to go his own way. The ability to man-manage will be tested because a policy of putting team before egos means the headline victims are the centre\u2011backs Phil Jones and Chris Smalling, plus the midfielder Nemanja Matic, all senior players. Solskj\u00e6r could not find even a place on the bench for Jones and Smalling for the 4-0 win against Chelsea or 1-1 draw at Molineux. Their demotion occurred after Victor Lindel\u00f6f and Harry Maguire started, which meant a drop in status to fourth and fifth choice, as the 21\u2011year\u2011old Axel Tuanzebe was preferred by Solskj\u00e6r as the backup central defender in the matchday 18. The manager\u2019s move comes after Jones and Smalling agreed new contracts last season. The latter\u2019s was extended to 2022 with an option for a further year, meaning Smalling in theory will be a United defender at 34. Jones\u2019s deal runs to 2023 and also has a 12-month extension clause, so he will be 31 when the terms end. Whereas Smalling\u2019s deal was agreed three days before Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was sacked last December, Solskj\u00e6r was in charge when Jones signed on again, though this may have been a fait accompli for the then caretaker manager. Clear, though, is how, as the permanent manager, he has acted decisively regarding his view of a pair who have a collective 17 years at the club. And when Eric Bailly returns from his latest knee injury Jones and Smalling may be marginalised further. Bailly is \u2013 alongside Maguire, Lindel\u00f6f, Smalling, Jones, Marcos Rojo and Tuanzebe \u2013 one of seven central defenders that, Solskj\u00e6r conceded before the trip to Wolves, are \u201ctoo many to keep happy\u201d. With the continental transfer window open until early next month Solskj\u00e6r will hope to prune at least one but even this would leave six players for the two centre\u2011back places with which he plans to operate in most matches. Rojo, 29, has previously come close to leaving and may go, as might Matteo Darmian, a full\u2011back who is the same age and has been on the verge of departing during the past three summers. Matic is another former automatic choice who has a fight on his hands, as Andreas Pereira, 23, and Scott McTominay, 22, move ahead of him.

Of the trio only Mata made an appearance in the opening games, as an 86th-minute replacement at Wolves, Matic being an unused substitute for each, with Young on the bench at Molineux. At 26 Fred is no veteran but finds himself in a similar scenario: left out of both 18s and, as a midfielder, relegated to fifth choice behind Paul Pogba, McTominay, Pereira and Matic. Alexis S\u00e1nchez is 31 in December and yet to feature and Solskj\u00e6r will be relieved should the misfiring forward\u2019s proposed move to Internazionale occur. If the average age of 30 of the quintet of Jones, Smalling, Mata, Matic and Young is one reason for them facing bit-part roles, another is that \u2013 Mata apart \u2013 none is an ideal fit for the Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s fast, pressing style. Yet all could start grumbling if no real match time is enjoyed, and Solskj\u00e6r has a squad of 28, which is five outfield players too many. Keeping those moved to the outside onside will be a challenge. After the 4-0 humbling at Everton in April the manager said: \u201cI\u2019m going to be successful here, and there are players here that won\u2019t be part of that successful team.\u201d This seemed to indicate a removal of dead wood during the close season yet by the time the domestic transfer market finished it had not happened.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s not Auden\u2019s best poem or (since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/02/wh.auden\" title=\"\">\u201cFuneral Blues\u201d appeared in the film <em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em></a>) his most famous. It\u2019s not even one he cared for: \u201cThe most dishonest poem I have ever written\u201d he called it, and after an abortive attempt at revision he eventually disowned it. But as Ian Sansom says \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d is \u201ca poem that still reverberates with meaning and controversy, a poem that readers return to at times of personal and national crisis\u201d. His richly entertaining book explores what goes on in the poem and why it has had such an impact. Having spent the past 25 years failing to write a magnum opus on Auden, he opts for something quirkier: a jaunt round 99 lines of verse. \u201cI sit in one of the dives / On Fifty-Second Street / Uncertain and afraid\u201d the poem begins.</p> <p>Poets can\u2019t always be trusted when they say \u201cI\u201d but Auden\u2019s diary confirms that he did indeed go to a bar (the Dizzy Club) that evening. As he sat there he may have been as troubled by a bad dream he\u2019d had, of his lover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1985/mar/21/biography\" title=\"\">Chester Kallman</a> being unfaithful, as by the German invasion of Poland. Perhaps he also brooded on his abandonment of Europe for New York earlier that year, for which he\u2019d been attacked in the UK. But such private anxieties went unspoken: nazism, Hitler, the threat to democracy and freedom \u2013 it\u2019s the state of the world that preoccupies him over the poem\u2019s nine stanzas.</p> <p>Sansom can\u2019t be said to rush us through them. It\u2019s page 112 before he finishes looking at the first verse. He\u2019s apologetic and self-mocking about this. Not that he\u2019s sluggish, but he can\u2019t resist a detour; half the book is made up of parentheses.</p> <p>After a decade of frenetic travel and intellectual activity, Auden sits himself down in order to think \u2013 then shares his thoughts, as if we\u2019re sitting next to him. His poem is public yet intimate \u2013 a feat so difficult to pull off that Sansom spends 300 pages trying to understand it and still inevitably falls short. Though he hero worships Auden and thinks him a genius, he\u2019s not uncritical. The man at the bar can be a bore at times, gesturing and sermonising rather than conversing. He can also be naive in his psychologising, as when attributing the rise of nazism to the treaty of Versailles or explaining Hitler\u2019s wickedness in terms of his childhood traumas (\u201cThose to whom evil is done / Do evil in return\u201d). \u201cBanal, deficient and silly\u201d Sansom calls him at one point.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not Auden\u2019s best poem or (since \u201cFuneral Blues\u201d appeared in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral) his most famous. It\u2019s not even one he cared for: \u201cThe most dishonest poem I have ever written\u201d he called it, and after an abortive attempt at revision he eventually disowned it. But as Ian Sansom says \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d is \u201ca poem that still reverberates with meaning and controversy, a poem that readers return to at times of personal and national crisis\u201d. His richly entertaining book explores what goes on in the poem and why it has had such an impact. Having spent the past 25 years failing to write a magnum opus on Auden, he opts for something quirkier: a jaunt round 99 lines of verse. \u201cI sit in one of the dives / On Fifty-Second Street / Uncertain and afraid\u201d the poem begins. Poets can\u2019t always be trusted when they say \u201cI\u201d but Auden\u2019s diary confirms that he did indeed go to a bar (the Dizzy Club) that evening. As he sat there he may have been as troubled by a bad dream he\u2019d had, of his lover Chester Kallman being unfaithful, as by the German invasion of Poland. Perhaps he also brooded on his abandonment of Europe for New York earlier that year, for which he\u2019d been attacked in the UK. But such private anxieties went unspoken: nazism, Hitler, the threat to democracy and freedom \u2013 it\u2019s the state of the world that preoccupies him over the poem\u2019s nine stanzas. Sansom can\u2019t be said to rush us through them. It\u2019s page 112 before he finishes looking at the first verse. He\u2019s apologetic and self-mocking about this. Not that he\u2019s sluggish, but he can\u2019t resist a detour; half the book is made up of parentheses. After a decade of frenetic travel and intellectual activity, Auden sits himself down in order to think \u2013 then shares his thoughts, as if we\u2019re sitting next to him. His poem is public yet intimate \u2013 a feat so difficult to pull off that Sansom spends 300 pages trying to understand it and still inevitably falls short. Though he hero worships Auden and thinks him a genius, he\u2019s not uncritical. The man at the bar can be a bore at times, gesturing and sermonising rather than conversing. He can also be naive in his psychologising, as when attributing the rise of nazism to the treaty of Versailles or explaining Hitler\u2019s wickedness in terms of his childhood traumas (\u201cThose to whom evil is done / Do evil in return\u201d). \u201cBanal, deficient and silly\u201d Sansom calls him at one point. But the flaws come as a relief: \u201cIf I\u2019ve learned anything reading Auden, it\u2019s how wearying unceasing brilliance can be, so much so that one cherishes any sign of weakness.\u201d The persona Auden creates \u2013 a man in a bar, overwhelmed by cataclysmic world events \u2013 partly explains the poem\u2019s popularity after 9/11. More to the point, it\u2019s set in New York in September. And to anyone seeing (or smelling) the ash clouds from the World Trade Center, the line \u201cthe unmentionable odour of death\u201d couldn\u2019t help but resonate.

Sansom notes that each of these is a single sentence and though Auden stretches the syntax to achieve that (with some dubious colons and semi-colons), they\u2019re undeniably single units of thought. A dazzling achievement, then, but one that Auden regretted, if only because of the last line of the penultimate stanza: \u201cWe must love one another or die\u201d, an assertion he dismissed as a lie, on the grounds that we have to die anyway.

Though he scolds himself for taking so long over the book, its slowness in coming has several advantages \u2013 not just in showing how Auden\u2019s poem continues to reverberate today (the references to Blair, Obama, Trump and Boris Johnson aren\u2019t in the least gratuitous), or in the number of books he has drawn on, relatively few about Auden, as part of his research (the select bibliography runs to 40 pages), but in the originality of his approach.

At this point, after yet another Super Bowl win, Brady has little to prove. Surely, the wounds of his sixth-round draft selection have been patched with two record-breaking decades of winning. But at an age most players are working on their golf game or talking about other players playing football on TV, Brady continues to throw touchdowns and win NFL championships. Maybe it\u2019s because Brady has never really relied purely on his physical gifts. According to Hirofumi Tanaka, an researcher of aging at the University of Texas, there can be substantial variations in how fast or slow physiological functions go down with increasing age. The good news for Brady and every other aging athlete is that a lot can be done to slow down that process.

Though the changes are inevitable, athletes, or anyone for that matter, can retard the loss of muscle mass and strength with resistance training. Strength, not traditionally associated with the quarterback position, is critical for Brady to maintain a strong base for throwing and to help prevent injury. Brady, with the help of training guru Alex Guerrero, has been dedicated to a resistance training program for many years.

      "bodyText": "The introduction of more rigorous GCSE courses in England and elsewhere in the UK appears to have benefited girls more than boys, including in subjects such as physics and maths, where girls have narrowed the gap in grades. More than one in four exam entries by girls aged 16 received top grades of A or 7 and above in this summer\u2019s exams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, an improvement of half a percentage point to 25.3% compared with last year, while just 18.6% of entries by boys in Year 11 achieved the same grades. In England girls won the majority of the coveted top grade of 9, with 5.2% of female entries gaining the grade that replaced the top end of the previous A* grade, compared with 3.7% of boys and a combined rate of 4.5%. Just below that, 13.1% of girls gained a level 8, compared with 9.4% of boys. In England, 837 students achieved a full set of 9s in seven or more subjects, with girls making up two-thirds of the high-flyers. Overall, more than 220,000 grade 9s were awarded. In maths, the largest single subject, there was a substantial closing of the gap between boys and girls at age 16. While the proportion of boys obtaining top grades nudged up slightly to 20.6%, the proportion of girls getting A/7 or above leapt by nearly a percentage point, from 19% last year to 19.9%, more than halving the difference between the two groups. In physics \u2013 a subject traditionally dominated by boys \u2013 girls made large strides in eliminating the gap in grades, which is close to disappearing at grades C, or 4, and above. In the top grades the proportion of girls jumped from 40% to 42.1%, driving a strong improvement overall, while the proportion of boys rose by just 0.3 percentage points to 46.1%. The improved results come after last week\u2019s A-level results revealed that more girls than boys entered science subjects for the first time, the culmination of decades of effort to increase the involvement of women in science, maths and technology (Stem) subjects. Derek Richardson of Pearson, which owns the Edexcel examination board, said: \u201cWe know that young people are increasingly concerned about the world around them and want to make a difference. The \u2018Attenborough effect\u2019 is fuelling an interest in science, and young people are focusing their studies towards the world of work where there\u2019s an increasing demand for Stem careers.\u201d The figures released by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) showed a significant increase in the number of girls taking computing, up 14%. Girls are still heavily outnumbered by boys, making up less than a quarter of the total entries, but they continue to outperform their male peers at the subject with just under 25% getting A/7 compared with 21% of boys. Girls at age 16 also improved their lead over boys in biology, engineering, classical subjects, French and German. The UK-wide results showed that for 16-year-olds there were improved results in the proportion gaining C/4 grades, and a jump in those attaining A/7 grades and above. The proportion gaining the top grades went up to 21.9%, an increase of 0.4 percentage points, while the proportion with C/4 was 69.9%, up from 69.3%. It is the third year of results for the new-style GCSE exams in England, which have more complex content, a greater reliance on final exam results and replace the previous A* to G grades with a scale running from 9 to 1. Under the grading system, a 4 is equivalent to a C, while the former top grades of A* and A are split into 9, 8 and 7. The new GCSEs have been criticised in recent days by headteachers, teaching unions and the Girlguiding movement for increasing levels of stress among pupils, and for being too demanding for many pupils, including those with special needs. Philip Wright, the Joint Council for Qualifications director general, said: \u201cStudents and teachers have done a great job during a period of reform as this year\u2019s results have overall been stable, with small increases in pass rates at 7/A and 4/C. We are seeing more entries and better outcomes in the sciences and in computing from both males and females.\u201d Overall the number of exam entries was helped by a 1.5% rise in the number of 16-year-olds in the population, ending several years of demographic decline. There were more than 5.4m individual full course exam entries this summer, a rise of 50,000 compared with last year. Entries were also up in a number of subjects, especially humanities subjects included in the government\u2019s favoured English baccalaureate (Ebacc) suite, including geography and history. There was a 3% increase in modern foreign language entries, which had been in sharp decline for years. French remains the most popular language at GCSE, though Spanish entries went up by 7.5%. German entries dropped again, as did Chinese, where numbers fell from 4,410 to 3,200. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary in England, said: \u201cThe work this government has done to drive up standards means there has never been a better time to go on to further study. We will continue to focus on discipline, outcomes and standards, so whatever path they choose, young people will get a better and better education so they can be full of confidence about their future.\u201d This year\u2019s results in England complete the sweeping changes instituted in 2013 by Michael Gove.

While this might sound like a show genetically engineered to appeal to your average 30-year-old male, Brassic is also a very funny look at the working class, rural life and mental health, as this double bill soon makes clear. Hannah J Davies Tonight: The Trouble With Garden Centres? 7.30pm, ITV The winner of the week\u2019s most startling programme, this finds Chris Choi following up reports that garden centres may not be all that environmentally friendly, what with allegations of the use of black plastic and environmentally unsound peat-based compost. Don\u2019t tell Alan Titchmarsh. Ali Catterall The Octopus in My House 9pm, BBC Two Think you know everything about eight-armed cephalopods? You\u2019re in for a surprise with this Natural World doc, in which marine biologist David Scheel installs an octopus in a tank in his living room in Alaska. See how they form an unexpectedly intimate relationship; they even watch TV together (Blue Planet, naturally). Mike Bradley Rachel Khoo: My Swedish Kitchen 9pm, Food Network The new venture from the always watchable Khoo takes her to a Scandi cabin where she cooks up some easy food. Demonstrating how to wrap up a tortilla is as complicated as it gets, but all the inspiration you need is there, with pink pickled onions and wild boar tacos among the items on her menu.

At nearly 30, this isn\u2019t the life Ella imagined for herself; she had hoped to escape her evangelical lower middle-class upbringing to join \u201cthe creative classes\u201d, and she still makes desultory efforts to paint and draw. But she alternates constantly between two opposing certainties: both that she is wasting her talents and her precious youth, and that \u201ceach action she took mattered, whether it was changing a soiled disposable brief with kindness and tact or listening to a tedious reminiscence for the thousandth time\u201d.</p> <p>The novel focuses on her time caring for Jill, who is only 60. Jill\u2019s mind has been destroyed by a brain injury rather than age, and now she drifts through the house she shares with her long-suffering husband, Bryn, cradling a naked plastic doll and babbling her inexpressible distress, using a verbal tic that gives the novel its title (\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know! Say say say\u201d). As everything that makes Jill who she is crumbles away, Ella must negotiate her relationship with both of them, and with herself: what she can give them, what affirmation or purpose she might need from them, whether Bryn could be a friend, or a father figure, or a lover.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The book explores an unfashionable subject, the drive to be a good person, while wittily weighing up human fallibility</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is an intensely serious and careful book, which grapples with an unfashionable subject, the drive to be a good person, while wittily weighing up human fallibility. The narrative voice knows much more about Ella than she knows about herself \u2013 her vanity, her self-satisfaction, her laziness and blinkered thinking \u2013 but it also tracks, with sincerity and compassion, her attempts at authenticity and self-knowledge, her desire to create art and approach the sublime. It beautifully conjures the bounds of the self and the mind\u2019s efforts to overcome them, the way our ambitions and limitations are in constant dialogue. Throughout Jill\u2019s deterioration \u2013 predictable, inevitable, unbearable \u2013 it cherishes the rhythms of everyday life and the slow comforts of shared endurance, even in the midst of chaos and extremity: \u201cthe same chip in the plate as yesterday, but also the memory of yesterday\u2019s meal\u201d.</p> <p>The novel is particularly interesting about sexual politics and the romantic self. As a woke young bisexual woman, Ella knows the effects of living in a patriarchy, but she doesn\u2019t know how to circumvent the damage \u2013 \u201cwhat bits of her psyche were herself and what bits were scar tissue\u201d. Her relationship with girlfriend Alix is an unfolding lesson in how the messy imperfections of love can surprise us, trumping the sterile expectations of what we think we want. Before she met Alix, Ella had thought she was attracted to \u201cmasculine of centre\u201d girlfriends because, as Savage coolly reminds us, women are taught to eroticise power.</p> <p>The problem of men and women remains a live one, however, especially when it comes to Bryn. She is moved and surprised by Bryn\u2019s \u201cSisyphean\u201d care for Jill. \u201cWhy was this so startling? Did she think so little of men that it surprised her when they displayed the decency she would expect from a woman? Or did she think so little of women that they didn\u2019t warrant tender, self\u2011sacrificing care from a man?\u201d</p> <p>Like Ella, <em>Say Say Say</em> asks difficult questions, of society and of the self. There are no easy answers, but in the novel\u2019s quietly radical choice of subject matter and its open-eyed, open-hearted curiosity, it illuminates both the intimate dramas usually hidden behind closed doors and the shifting mysteries of personality and relationship.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Say Say Say is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail (\u00a312.99).

As everything that makes Jill who she is crumbles away, Ella must negotiate her relationship with both of them, and with herself: what she can give them, what affirmation or purpose she might need from them, whether Bryn could be a friend, or a father figure, or a lover. This is an intensely serious and careful book, which grapples with an unfashionable subject, the drive to be a good person, while wittily weighing up human fallibility. The narrative voice knows much more about Ella than she knows about herself \u2013 her vanity, her self-satisfaction, her laziness and blinkered thinking \u2013 but it also tracks, with sincerity and compassion, her attempts at authenticity and self-knowledge, her desire to create art and approach the sublime. It beautifully conjures the bounds of the self and the mind\u2019s efforts to overcome them, the way our ambitions and limitations are in constant dialogue. Throughout Jill\u2019s deterioration \u2013 predictable, inevitable, unbearable \u2013 it cherishes the rhythms of everyday life and the slow comforts of shared endurance, even in the midst of chaos and extremity: \u201cthe same chip in the plate as yesterday, but also the memory of yesterday\u2019s meal\u201d. The novel is particularly interesting about sexual politics and the romantic self. As a woke young bisexual woman, Ella knows the effects of living in a patriarchy, but she doesn\u2019t know how to circumvent the damage \u2013 \u201cwhat bits of her psyche were herself and what bits were scar tissue\u201d. Her relationship with girlfriend Alix is an unfolding lesson in how the messy imperfections of love can surprise us, trumping the sterile expectations of what we think we want. Before she met Alix, Ella had thought she was attracted to \u201cmasculine of centre\u201d girlfriends because, as Savage coolly reminds us, women are taught to eroticise power. The problem of men and women remains a live one, however, especially when it comes to Bryn. She is moved and surprised by Bryn\u2019s \u201cSisyphean\u201d care for Jill. \u201cWhy was this so startling? Did she think so little of men that it surprised her when they displayed the decency she would expect from a woman? Or did she think so little of women that they didn\u2019t warrant tender, self\u2011sacrificing care from a man?\u201d Like Ella, Say Say Say asks difficult questions, of society and of the self. There are no easy answers, but in the novel\u2019s quietly radical choice of subject matter and its open-eyed, open-hearted curiosity, it illuminates both the intimate dramas usually hidden behind closed doors and the shifting mysteries of personality and relationship. \u2022 Say Say Say is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail (\u00a312.99).

They decided to buy 100 footballs and hand them out to the neighbourhood boys.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"74e2378d0d404d9635d9a85d1df52bc23251175b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74e2378d0d404d9635d9a85d1df52bc23251175b/0_99_2984_1791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans of Real Kashmir cheer during their I-League club football match against Gokulam Kerala FC at the Tourist Reception Centre football ground in Srinagar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans of Real Kashmir cheer during their I-League club football match against Gokulam Kerala FC at the Tourist Reception Centre football ground in Srinagar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tauseef Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe knew they had to find an outlet for their energy.

The name is meant to show the \u2018real\u2019 face of Kashmir with boys playing football and families cheering them on instead of the usual images of violence in this conflict zone over which India and Pakistan have fought two wars.</p> <p>About the only thing supporting this grand ambition of creating Kashmir\u2019s first professional football club was the passion for football. In most of India, cricket is the religion but not in Kashmir. All the other odds, however, were stacked against them. Thirty years of civil strife had left no football infrastructure. There was no ground. The team had to train at the grounds of a tourist centre which was an open field with fencing and not even a wash room.</p> <p>There were days when the players had to work around shutdown, curfews, and grenade attacks to reach the centre. Their determination was intensified when Chattoo brought in Scottish player and coach David Robertson, after much persuasion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/15/narendra-modi-defends-indias-decision-to-end-kashmir-special-status\">India independence day celebration takes place under strict security in Kashmir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He declined offers from China and Uganda to end up in a place where the harsh winters, with no central speaking, have been a trial.

Over 20,000 people regularly fill the 15,000-capacity stadium in downtown Srinagar. Thousands stand outside. Protest marches have been called off for a match.</p> <p>For 90 minutes, Kashmiris experience what it is to feel happy and normal. When the roars from the stadium during a game reverberate across the snow-topped Zabarwan mountains encircling Srinagar, it is clear people have momentarily forgotten their troubles.</p> <p>For player Danish Farooq, the support of the local people has been uplifting. \u201cIn the winters, with sub-zero temperatures, they come and watch us, with no cover, nothing.

Tourists were being evacuated en masse from Kashmir. He sensed something was up. He told the players to leave their homes and reach a hotel near the airport.</p> <p>That way, even if a curfew or travel restrictions were suddenly imposed in downtown Srinagar, the team would be close to the airport and could catch their flight out of Kashmir. Without his quick thinking, Real Kashmir would have missed the tournament.</p> <p>The club\u2019s story is getting attention. Adidas India announced a partnership with the club \u2013 the first with any club in India. BBC Scotland and Al Jazeera have made documentaries. Netflix is working on a film and so is Bollywood.</p> <p>The accolades are merely spurring Chattoo on to push for greater things. \u201cI want football to change life in Kashmir.

      "bodyText": "Before an away match, Mohammed Hammad used to call his mother in Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir and ask her to pray for the team, Real Kashmir, a football club in the city whose miraculous rise in three years has made football-mad Kashmiris proud. On Saturday, the team was playing Goa FC at Kalyani stadium outside Kolkata for an important match but he didn\u2019t call his mother. Or rather, he couldn\u2019t. \u201cBecause of the communications lockdown, I couldn\u2019t call her for the prayer. Like everyone else, she is caged inside her home. I don\u2019t even know if my family has enough food and medicines,\u201d said Hammad. Inside the dressing room, the mood was jubilant. Amid loud music and high-fiving, the players congratulated themselves after a 0-0 draw on a pitch made swampy by torrential monsoon rains. The result took the team to the semi-finals of the Durand Cup, India\u2019s oldest football tournament, where they would eventually lose to Mohun Bagan in a tight game a few days later. Kashmir\u2019s first professional football club had already been stunning crowds by defeating more experienced clubs to make it to the I League, one of Indian football\u2019s premier competitions, but unlike other teams, the players have had a lot on their minds. Ever since they flew out of Kashmir on 5 August, they have had almost no contact with their families. That was the day a communications crackdown was imposed on landlines, mobiles and the internet shortly before New Delhi revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status, stripping away its autonomy. For Khalid Qayoom, the lockdown meant his parents hadn\u2019t even watched the matches. \u201cIt would have meant travelling to someone else\u2019s home and my father was scared he might break the curfew. None of us likes what is happening there. It\u2019s inhuman. But we are professionals and didn\u2019t let it affect our concentration,\u201d said Qayoom. The rise of Real Kashmir is a fairytale. For the past three decades, few happy stories, let alone fairytales, have come out of the troubled region, scarred by an armed insurgency and a heavy Indian troop presence that has brought Kashmiri youths out on the streets hurling stones at the soldiers while demanding \u201cazadi\u201d or freedom from India. Three years ago, Sandeep Chattoo, a Kashmiri Hindu, was talking to his Kashmiri Muslim friend Shamim Mehraj, about the endless violence and sense of hopelessness. They decided to buy 100 footballs and hand them out to the neighbourhood boys. \u201cWe knew they had to find an outlet for their energy. We wanted them to play football instead of throwing stones, to find a new direction. We wanted to inspire them to build a better life for themselves,\u201d said Chattoo who is co-owner of the club with Mehraj. Soon, a team was born. The name is meant to show the \u2018real\u2019 face of Kashmir with boys playing football and families cheering them on instead of the usual images of violence in this conflict zone over which India and Pakistan have fought two wars. About the only thing supporting this grand ambition of creating Kashmir\u2019s first professional football club was the passion for football. In most of India, cricket is the religion but not in Kashmir. All the other odds, however, were stacked against them. Thirty years of civil strife had left no football infrastructure. There was no ground. The team had to train at the grounds of a tourist centre which was an open field with fencing and not even a wash room. There were days when the players had to work around shutdown, curfews, and grenade attacks to reach the centre. Their determination was intensified when Chattoo brought in Scottish player and coach David Robertson, after much persuasion. He declined offers from China and Uganda to end up in a place where the harsh winters, with no central speaking, have been a trial. For days on end, there would be no internet, even before the current shutdown. \u201cNow the team is my family. It\u2019s been a fantastic journey. I am building something special here,\u201d said Robertson. The club has transformed life in the Valley. \u201cReal Kashmir is more than football. It\u2019s an act of hope,\u201d said Chattoo. Over 20,000 people regularly fill the 15,000-capacity stadium in downtown Srinagar. Thousands stand outside. Protest marches have been called off for a match. For 90 minutes, Kashmiris experience what it is to feel happy and normal. When the roars from the stadium during a game reverberate across the snow-topped Zabarwan mountains encircling Srinagar, it is clear people have momentarily forgotten their troubles. For player Danish Farooq, the support of the local people has been uplifting. \u201cIn the winters, with sub-zero temperatures, they come and watch us, with no cover, nothing. I guess people need something to look forward to and football gives them that,\u201d said Farooq. The team almost didn\u2019t make it to Kalyani stadium for the Saturday fixture. It was only because Chattoo has developed almost extra-sensory perceptions having lived in Kashmir for so long that it managed to fly out of Srinagar in the nick of time. In the days before the August 5 communications lockdown, Chattoo had been watching tens of thousands of extra troops being deployed. Tourists were being evacuated en masse from Kashmir. He sensed something was up. He told the players to leave their homes and reach a hotel near the airport. That way, even if a curfew or travel restrictions were suddenly imposed in downtown Srinagar, the team would be close to the airport and could catch their flight out of Kashmir. Without his quick thinking, Real Kashmir would have missed the tournament. The club\u2019s story is getting attention. Adidas India announced a partnership with the club \u2013 the first with any club in India. BBC Scotland and Al Jazeera have made documentaries. Netflix is working on a film and so is Bollywood. The accolades are merely spurring Chattoo on to push for greater things. \u201cI want football to change life in Kashmir. Football makes people happy and Kashmir needs happiness.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Cuadrilla was forced to halt fracking at its shale gas site near Blackpool in Lancashire on Wednesday night after triggering the largest tremor recorded at the location. The tremor closed down operations at the Preston New Road site shortly after it was detected at 8.46pm. The shutdown comes less than a week after Cuadrilla started fracking its second well on the site after abandoning the first well following multiple shutdowns because of tremors. The fracking firm said the \u201cmicroseismic event\u201d measured 1.55ML on the Richter scale, which it likened to \u201ca large bag of shopping dropping to the floor\u201d. The tremor is higher than the previous record quake, which measured 1.5ML at Little Plumpton in December 2018, and easily breaches the government\u2019s 0.5ML limit on seismic activity.

It has called for a government review of the rules, and extra time to drill after its current fracking licence expires in November. \u201cMinor movements of this level are to be expected and are way below anything that can cause harm or damage to anyone or their property,\u201d the spokesman said. Ministers hinted last week that they are considering a review of the system after lending support to Cuadrilla\u2019s campaign. A government spokesman said: \u201cShale gas could be an important new domestic energy source, reducing the level of gas imports while delivering broad economic benefits, including through the creation of well-paid, quality jobs.\u201d Doubts have been cast about the claims because of recent research from the University of Nottingham, which found that the UK\u2019s shale gas reserves may deliver only a fraction of the gas promised by fracking firms and government ministers.

      "body": "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So many people post pictures on Facebook with very advanced cameras, eg from iPhones. Alas, many do not crop their photos, the horizon is not horizontal, there are dark shadows \u2026 Some people do not even know the camera can face outwards: I notice so many selfies! I think a gentle article from Jack Schofield on how not to disappoint your friends with holiday pics would be wonderful. <strong>Lyndsay</strong> (via Facebook)</p> </blockquote> <p>There are some terrible photos on Facebook, but I think the average level is very high. Back in the dark ages BC (before computers), I edited several photographic magazines and a partwork, You and Your Camera. Then, the quality of the average enprint, as enlarged prints were called, was extremely low, and you couldn\u2019t edit pictures unless you printed them yourself. Photos taken with small-frame film formats \u2013 like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/110_film\">110 cartridges</a> used by Kodak\u2019s Pocket Instamatic cameras, introduced in 1972 \u2013 could be dire.</p> <p>Since then, cheap microchips have transformed amateur photography. Automatic exposure, automatic focusing, face/smile/blink detection and other features have made it much easier to take photos that are technically if not aesthetically superior. Smartphone post-processing techniques based on taking multiple images and/or multiple lenses are now making results even better. There are also possibilities that were barely dreamed of in the film era, such as softening portraits in-camera, making people look slimmer, adding kitten ears, or whatever.</p> <p>I don\u2019t even mind selfies, because their aims are purely social. They aren\u2019t supposed to be suitable for magazine covers or gallery walls, unless they\u2019re being taken by <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/cindy-sherman/exhibition/\">Cindy Sherman</a> or someone like Kim Kardashian.</p> <p>I\u2019m willing to cut people a bit of slack on the editing front. If you have a personal computer with a big screen, it\u2019s easy to crop photos and improve them in other ways. You can do some editing in the standard Photos apps in Microsoft\u2019s Windows 10 and Apple\u2019s MacOS, and far more with a free program such as <a href=\"https://www.getpaint.net/\">Paint.net</a>, or the paid-for <a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/\">Affinity Photo</a>. It\u2019s harder if you are working on a small screen, and I don\u2019t think Snapseed has an \u201cautomated levelling\u201d button to make horizons horizontal. Yet.</p> <p>The obvious solution would be for Facebook to provide a decent built-in photo editor, and I think that is long overdue.

      "bodyText": "So many people post pictures on Facebook with very advanced cameras, eg from iPhones. Alas, many do not crop their photos, the horizon is not horizontal, there are dark shadows \u2026 Some people do not even know the camera can face outwards: I notice so many selfies! I think a gentle article from Jack Schofield on how not to disappoint your friends with holiday pics would be wonderful. Lyndsay (via Facebook) There are some terrible photos on Facebook, but I think the average level is very high. Back in the dark ages BC (before computers), I edited several photographic magazines and a partwork, You and Your Camera. Then, the quality of the average enprint, as enlarged prints were called, was extremely low, and you couldn\u2019t edit pictures unless you printed them yourself. Photos taken with small-frame film formats \u2013 like the 110 cartridges used by Kodak\u2019s Pocket Instamatic cameras, introduced in 1972 \u2013 could be dire. Since then, cheap microchips have transformed amateur photography. Automatic exposure, automatic focusing, face/smile/blink detection and other features have made it much easier to take photos that are technically if not aesthetically superior. Smartphone post-processing techniques based on taking multiple images and/or multiple lenses are now making results even better. There are also possibilities that were barely dreamed of in the film era, such as softening portraits in-camera, making people look slimmer, adding kitten ears, or whatever. I don\u2019t even mind selfies, because their aims are purely social. They aren\u2019t supposed to be suitable for magazine covers or gallery walls, unless they\u2019re being taken by Cindy Sherman or someone like Kim Kardashian. I\u2019m willing to cut people a bit of slack on the editing front. If you have a personal computer with a big screen, it\u2019s easy to crop photos and improve them in other ways. You can do some editing in the standard Photos apps in Microsoft\u2019s Windows 10 and Apple\u2019s MacOS, and far more with a free program such as Paint.net, or the paid-for Affinity Photo.

      "body": "<p>The first time I tried to have sex I was 16. I knew it might hurt and that perhaps I would bleed. I was OK with that: it was part of the mythology. I imagined that, afterwards, I would stare at myself in the bathroom mirror, like the heroine in my own coming-of-age drama.</p> <p>As it turned out, I had to stop the sex before it properly began. An excruciating pain at the opening of my vagina shocked me into total stillness \u2013 it felt like burning and ripping at once. I was so consumed with shame that I couldn\u2019t have looked at my reflection if I had tried.</p> <p>This was the first time I experienced what I now know as vulvodynia, an umbrella term for a condition characterised by chronic pain of the vulva. I was diagnosed at the age of 24, after years of being sent away from sexual health clinics with vague advice to \u201cchange positions\u201d.</p> <p>According to the US\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nva.org/media-center/\" title=\"\">National Vulvodynia Association</a>, as many as 16% of women experience the condition at some point. Some have pain only during penetrative sex or when using tampons; for others, it is far more severe \u2013 their discomfort is such that they can barely sit down. The pain itself is sharp and searing, and can range from giving the same sensation as severe thrush to feeling as if something inside you has been torn.</p> <p>Amy*, 32, first noticed a problem when she was 14 and tried to insert a tampon. \u201cThe pain was so intense that I thought I was going to pass out.\u201d She continued to use sanitary towels and the problem didn\u2019t occur again until she lost her virginity at 17. \u201cThe problem stayed and never went away,\u201d she says. She went to several doctors, none of whom had any answers. Last year, she went for a smear test. \u201cI lay there in tears during what should have been a routine procedure.\u201d She describes the pain as \u201clike a red hot poker; the worst pain I\u2019ve experienced.\u201d She was referred to a gynaecologist and was finally diagnosed with vulvodynia.</p> <p>There is no commonly agreed cause of the condition, because it isn\u2019t defined by any physical abnormality. As a result, those living with it are often misdiagnosed with recurrent thrush, referred for psychosexual counselling (which is sometimes, but not always, necessary), repeatedly tested for sexually transmitted infections, or dismissed. \u201cBecause this is a condition you can\u2019t see objectively, it\u2019s harder to understand,\u201d says Dr Attam Singh, a consultant in pain medicine at the London Pain Clinic.\u201d It\u2019s a very small and specific specialist problem within the speciality of gynaecology.\u201d</p> <p>Sue*, 51, began to experience vulval pain 12 years ago, but it was eight years before it was diagnosed properly. It started with a feeling of irritation in her genital area, especially when her legs were closed. \u201cI was finding myself standing with my legs apart. It got so bad that I couldn\u2019t even put on a pair of pants. I couldn\u2019t sit down at all,\u201d she says. \u201cMy GP, no matter how fantastic he was, had no idea, because everything looked absolutely fine.\u201d</p> <p>Sue first came across the term vulvodynia on the website for Channel 4\u2019s Embarrassing Bodies. \u201cIt was everything I had. My husband asked the doctor to look it up and he said: \u2018I think that\u2019s it, yes.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Part of the problem is a lack of research. Dr David Nunns, a consultant gynaecologist at Nottingham City hospital, is one of the few experts in vulvodynia. Although the term has been around since the 1800s, it was only in the 1980s that it began to be taken seriously by the medical community. The research at that time was very much medically led, says Nunns, because there was little in the way of funding for research, but, he says: \u201cIn the last 10 years, there\u2019s been more of a focus on a chronic-pain-management approach to the condition, which helps women to manage it.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Deborah Boyle is a consultant gynaecologist at the UK\u2019s largest vulval service, based at the Royal Free hospital in London. She says the dearth of research into vulval pain can be partly explained by the reality of \u201ca public health system that is so strapped for cash\u201d, but also, because vulval pain is not an urgent public health issue, research into it is hard to do.</p> <p>\u201cIf somebody has a pain problem, it has a massive impact on their life and their sense of self \u2013 but those consequences aren\u2019t necessarily felt in the GP surgery or in the gynaecology service,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when there isn\u2019t a drug development issue, it\u2019s harder to get anybody particularly interested, which I find quite depressing: it\u2019s women\u2019s quality of life.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Virginia Beckett, a spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, agrees that NHS cuts are a major factor in the lack of awareness among healthcare professionals and long diagnosis times. \u201cThe NHS is in dire straits and sexual health services are <a href=\"https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/our-key-themes/health-and-adult-services/public-health/sexual-health-0\" title=\"\">now under the control of local councils</a> rather than NHS trusts,\u201d she says. \u201cThe services for women\u2019s health have been fragmented; contraceptive services are now done mainly over the phone or on the internet.\u201d In these conditions, it is no wonder that vulval pain \u2013 a frequently mystifying problem \u2013 flies under the radar.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12744420\" title=\"\">2003 study in the US</a> found that 60% of women who sought treatment for vulvodynia had seen three or more doctors, many of whom did not provide a diagnosis. \u201cIt takes an enormous amount of courage to visit a doctor and talk about such a personal issue, so to be dismissed is incredibly damaging,\u201d says Amy. \u201cThe physical pain is one thing, but I think the emotional scars caused by years of suffering with no help, and feeling so isolated by it, have actually done the most damage.\u201d</p> <p>In her 2018 memoir <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ask-me-about-my-uterus-a-quest-to-make-doctors-believe-in-women-s-pain.html\" title=\"\">Ask Me About My Uterus</a>: A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women\u2019s Pain, Abby Norman examined gender politics and <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/women-and-pain-disparities-in-experience-and-treatment-2017100912562\" title=\"\">medicine</a>. Why is it that vaginal pain is still so misunderstood? \u201cWhen the definition of so-called \u2018textbook cases\u2019 have primarily been written by men, the language used becomes precedent,\u201d she says. \u201cWe see echoes of this when the health concerns of anyone who doesn\u2019t identify as male are dismissed or disbelieved. Women seem especially prone to being outright accused of manipulation or hysteria.\u201d</p> <p>There are, however, places women like me can turn to.

      "bodyText": "The first time I tried to have sex I was 16. I knew it might hurt and that perhaps I would bleed. I was OK with that: it was part of the mythology. I imagined that, afterwards, I would stare at myself in the bathroom mirror, like the heroine in my own coming-of-age drama. As it turned out, I had to stop the sex before it properly began. An excruciating pain at the opening of my vagina shocked me into total stillness \u2013 it felt like burning and ripping at once. I was so consumed with shame that I couldn\u2019t have looked at my reflection if I had tried. This was the first time I experienced what I now know as vulvodynia, an umbrella term for a condition characterised by chronic pain of the vulva. I was diagnosed at the age of 24, after years of being sent away from sexual health clinics with vague advice to \u201cchange positions\u201d. According to the US\u2019s National Vulvodynia Association, as many as 16% of women experience the condition at some point. Some have pain only during penetrative sex or when using tampons; for others, it is far more severe \u2013 their discomfort is such that they can barely sit down. The pain itself is sharp and searing, and can range from giving the same sensation as severe thrush to feeling as if something inside you has been torn. Amy*, 32, first noticed a problem when she was 14 and tried to insert a tampon. \u201cThe pain was so intense that I thought I was going to pass out.\u201d She continued to use sanitary towels and the problem didn\u2019t occur again until she lost her virginity at 17. \u201cThe problem stayed and never went away,\u201d she says. She went to several doctors, none of whom had any answers. Last year, she went for a smear test. \u201cI lay there in tears during what should have been a routine procedure.\u201d She describes the pain as \u201clike a red hot poker; the worst pain I\u2019ve experienced.\u201d She was referred to a gynaecologist and was finally diagnosed with vulvodynia. There is no commonly agreed cause of the condition, because it isn\u2019t defined by any physical abnormality. As a result, those living with it are often misdiagnosed with recurrent thrush, referred for psychosexual counselling (which is sometimes, but not always, necessary), repeatedly tested for sexually transmitted infections, or dismissed. \u201cBecause this is a condition you can\u2019t see objectively, it\u2019s harder to understand,\u201d says Dr Attam Singh, a consultant in pain medicine at the London Pain Clinic.\u201d It\u2019s a very small and specific specialist problem within the speciality of gynaecology.\u201d Sue*, 51, began to experience vulval pain 12 years ago, but it was eight years before it was diagnosed properly. It started with a feeling of irritation in her genital area, especially when her legs were closed. \u201cI was finding myself standing with my legs apart. It got so bad that I couldn\u2019t even put on a pair of pants. I couldn\u2019t sit down at all,\u201d she says. \u201cMy GP, no matter how fantastic he was, had no idea, because everything looked absolutely fine.\u201d Sue first came across the term vulvodynia on the website for Channel 4\u2019s Embarrassing Bodies. \u201cIt was everything I had. My husband asked the doctor to look it up and he said: \u2018I think that\u2019s it, yes.\u2019\u201d Part of the problem is a lack of research. Dr David Nunns, a consultant gynaecologist at Nottingham City hospital, is one of the few experts in vulvodynia. Although the term has been around since the 1800s, it was only in the 1980s that it began to be taken seriously by the medical community. The research at that time was very much medically led, says Nunns, because there was little in the way of funding for research, but, he says: \u201cIn the last 10 years, there\u2019s been more of a focus on a chronic-pain-management approach to the condition, which helps women to manage it.\u201d Dr Deborah Boyle is a consultant gynaecologist at the UK\u2019s largest vulval service, based at the Royal Free hospital in London. She says the dearth of research into vulval pain can be partly explained by the reality of \u201ca public health system that is so strapped for cash\u201d, but also, because vulval pain is not an urgent public health issue, research into it is hard to do. \u201cIf somebody has a pain problem, it has a massive impact on their life and their sense of self \u2013 but those consequences aren\u2019t necessarily felt in the GP surgery or in the gynaecology service,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when there isn\u2019t a drug development issue, it\u2019s harder to get anybody particularly interested, which I find quite depressing: it\u2019s women\u2019s quality of life.\u201d Dr Virginia Beckett, a spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, agrees that NHS cuts are a major factor in the lack of awareness among healthcare professionals and long diagnosis times. \u201cThe NHS is in dire straits and sexual health services are now under the control of local councils rather than NHS trusts,\u201d she says. \u201cThe services for women\u2019s health have been fragmented; contraceptive services are now done mainly over the phone or on the internet.\u201d In these conditions, it is no wonder that vulval pain \u2013 a frequently mystifying problem \u2013 flies under the radar. A 2003 study in the US found that 60% of women who sought treatment for vulvodynia had seen three or more doctors, many of whom did not provide a diagnosis. \u201cIt takes an enormous amount of courage to visit a doctor and talk about such a personal issue, so to be dismissed is incredibly damaging,\u201d says Amy. \u201cThe physical pain is one thing, but I think the emotional scars caused by years of suffering with no help, and feeling so isolated by it, have actually done the most damage.\u201d In her 2018 memoir Ask Me About My Uterus: A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women\u2019s Pain, Abby Norman examined gender politics and medicine. Why is it that vaginal pain is still so misunderstood? \u201cWhen the definition of so-called \u2018textbook cases\u2019 have primarily been written by men, the language used becomes precedent,\u201d she says. \u201cWe see echoes of this when the health concerns of anyone who doesn\u2019t identify as male are dismissed or disbelieved. Women seem especially prone to being outright accused of manipulation or hysteria.\u201d There are, however, places women like me can turn to. The Vulval Pain Society (for which Nunns is a medical adviser) is a charity that provides crucial information about many aspects of vulval pain, largely via the internet. Indeed, for many women, especially those in locations where care is difficult to access, the internet has been a godsend. The fact that I recently asked to be referred for physiotherapy was entirely down to recommendations on a Facebook group. Becki, 21, has also experienced the positive effects of online resources.

I am a mother of three (including twins), survivor of severe postnatal depression that almost made me hurt my daughter and take my own life, sexual abuse survivor, second eldest of 17 siblings, raised by my white father as a single parent and separated from my mother and most of my culture. I grew up in a town where you were either black or white \u2013 not both. I never fitted into either world, so I decided I didn\u2019t want to belong. I would create my own path and destiny. I refused to be defined by circumstances, and was determined that the cycle would break with me. My children would be the beginning of a new cycle. From this beginning and always being told I wasn\u2019t good enough, or that my future was defined by the circumstances I was born into and given in life, I said: \u201cwatch me\u201d. I knew there had to be more and I had the courage to listen to the whisper in my heart that said I was born to do something in this life. I became the Barkindji Warrior, a warrior who leads from the heart. I am now 35 years old, I am the first in my family to finish high school, to graduate university with three degrees \u2013 bachelor of arts, bachelor of teaching, postgraduate certificate in Indigenous trauma and recovery.

      "body": "<p>The first suicide bomber in English literature is a crazed anarchist professor in Joseph Conrad\u2019s novel <em>The Secret Agent</em> who stalks around London wired up with explosives. Entranced by a vision of pure nothingness, he has only to squeeze a rubber ball in his pocket to annihilate the present and clear a space for a utopian future. His political comrades are a bunch of sinister continental freaks who succeed in blowing up a young boy with learning difficulties.</p> <p>Anarchism, in short, has something of an image problem. Even Ruth Kinna, in this sympathetic, impressively well-informed history of the movement, has to admit that it has had its fair share of bombers and assassins. Yet she also illustrates its extraordinary creativity. Born in the 19th century, a brainchild of the Unholy Trinity of French libertarian socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Russian revolutionaries Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin, anarchism rejected what it saw as Karl Marx\u2019s narrow economic and proletarian viewpoint. Nevertheless, the two creeds have a lot in common. Both believe in class struggle, the abolition of private property and the overthrow of the state. Both see the role of the state as defending private property, a view that you can also find in Cicero. Marx thinks that the state will eventually wither away, while anarchists believe in helping it on its way as soon as they can.</p> <p>Where the two camps really collide is on the question of power. Power for Marxists is in the service of material interests. It isn\u2019t the last word. Anarchists agree about the material interests, but see power as more primary than that. Domination of any kind is to be rejected. Anarchism isn\u2019t opposed to government as such, just to any form of it that isn\u2019t self-government. For many, this includes democracy, which involves the tyranny of the majority over the individual. Marxists will work with liberal democracy, whereas anarchists won\u2019t. For them, it is just a more kid-gloved kind of coercion.</p> <p>Yet no society can survive without coercion. There is nothing despotic about being made to drive on the left, or stopping your flatmate from playing the bagpipes all night. Rules can facilitate freedom as well as obstruct it: if everyone drives on the same side of the road, I\u2019m less likely to end up in a wheelchair. The political state is indeed a source of lethal violence, but it also arranges for children to learn how to tie their shoelaces. Not all power is repressive, nor all authority obnoxious. There is the authority of those who are seasoned in the struggle against patriarchy, which one would do well to respect. Telling someone something they need to know isn\u2019t always \u201chierarchical\u201d. Nor is knowledge, as some slightly wackier libertarians have maintained. Some anti-hierarchical anarchists believe that all opinions hold equal weight, in which case the view that all opinions don\u2019t hold equal weight is also true. When the young Noam Chomsky (an anarchist, no less) came to Europe in the late 1960s with vital information on the political turmoil in the United States, some students refused to listen to him on the grounds that lecturing is a form of violence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d241ec25f639611447d9e25d00b45e82e46588a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d241ec25f639611447d9e25d00b45e82e46588a/0_67_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Occupy London protesters in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Occupy London protesters in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even so, anarchism has been among the most daring, imaginative political currents of the modern age, from the Paris Commune of 1871 to the Occupy movement of 2011-12 (20,000 Parisians were slaughtered in the wake of the Commune, a fact that those appalled by the French revolutionary terror generally fail to recall). By the end of the 19th century, the movement had become a global presence from Uruguay to Japan. Rejecting state socialism and revolutionary vanguards, it devoted itself instead to direct action, self-governing cooperatives, experiments in education, flexible networks and grass-roots organising.

Yet the term isn\u2019t all that restrictive: as Kinna points out, it includes class-struggle anarchism, social anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism, post-left anarchy, individualistic anarchism and quite a lot more. Post-left anarchy, one of whose advocates once sponsored something called Groucho Marxism, is basically just a matter of having a good time. There are those activists for whom there can\u2019t really be anarchist parties or political programmes, since parties and programmes are part of the problem rather than the solution.

Philosophical egoism, however, has not had many takers in anarchist circles, as opposed to the common-or-garden variety.

Yet we cannot ignore the fundamental role that governments can play in either promoting or thwarting change.</p> <p>That is why the four of us accepted French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s invitation to join 32 colleagues to form a <a href=\"https://www.elysee.fr/en/g7/advisory-council\">G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council</a>. On Sunday, we will present the culmination of our work; a package of recommended laws focused on ending gender-based violence; ensuring inclusive, equitable, and quality health and education; promoting the economic empowerment of women; and combating discrimination, ensuring full gender equality in policies and public life. In each area we point to laws from around the world that illustrate the type of action countries should take.</p> <p>Most countries \u2013 including the G7 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.unwomen.org/-/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2019/equality-in%20law-for-women-and-girls-en.pdf?la=en&amp;vs=5600\">still have discriminatory laws</a> that violate the rights of girls and women. Almost 40% have at least one constraint on women\u2019s rights to own property. Women don\u2019t have the same rights as men to get a job or pursue a trade or profession in 18 countries or to get a national ID card in 11 countries.

      "bodyText": "The sheer tenacity of women raising their voices and organising for fundamental change has been, and will continue to be, the driving force for achieving women\u2019s rights and a gender-equal world. Yet we cannot ignore the fundamental role that governments can play in either promoting or thwarting change. That is why the four of us accepted French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s invitation to join 32 colleagues to form a G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council. On Sunday, we will present the culmination of our work; a package of recommended laws focused on ending gender-based violence; ensuring inclusive, equitable, and quality health and education; promoting the economic empowerment of women; and combating discrimination, ensuring full gender equality in policies and public life. In each area we point to laws from around the world that illustrate the type of action countries should take. Most countries \u2013 including the G7 \u2013 still have discriminatory laws that violate the rights of girls and women. Almost 40% have at least one constraint on women\u2019s rights to own property. Women don\u2019t have the same rights as men to get a job or pursue a trade or profession in 18 countries or to get a national ID card in 11 countries. Added to these archaic laws are the more recent ones that restrict women\u2019s bodily autonomy, and deny sexual and reproductive rights. More positively, there are hundreds of good laws that address critical issues and push progress. For example, Denmark has a new law on cyber harassment, Iceland has the strongest equal pay laws in the world, and Morocco is institutionalising gender equality throughout budget processes. Our recommendations will be included in President Macron\u2019s call on world leaders to ditch discriminatory laws and enact legal reforms that accelerate progress for girls, women and gender equality. We encourage not only the G7, but all governments to join what France is calling \u201cthe Biarritz Partnership\u201d and adhere to international agreements relating to women\u2019s rights. While legal reform is absolutely necessary, it is far from sufficient. A G7 commitment means little if national budgets don\u2019t reflect these priorities.

      "body": "<p>From plumes of powder to spritzes of perfumes, the department-store beauty hall has remained in many ways unchanged since Harry Selfridge first moved personal-care products to the front of his Oxford Street store early last century. But in the face of a difficult retail landscape, with the British high street suffering closures and losses as footfall dries up, the beauty industry is fighting back against the mass exodus of consumers from bricks-and-mortar stores to online retailers. How? By putting exclusivity and experiences at the heart of its offering \u2013 whether it is receiving makeup tips directly from Pat McGrath or getting your hands on products you can\u2019t find anywhere else in the world.</p> <p>So far, it\u2019s working. According to market research company The NPD Group, <a href=\"https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/blog/2019/the-growing-importance-of-beauty-consultants-in-a-digital-world/\">British high-street stores still accounted for 80% of prestige beauty sales in 2018</a>, while, in fashion, Mintel reported that online sales already made up almost a quarter of total spend back in 2017. Same-day delivery and add-to-basket ease might make online shopping the more convenient option, but when it comes to beauty, nothing quite compares to the ability to sniff, play with and try products in the flesh. Nars\u2019s new highlighter might look like any other highlighter online, but have you seen, in person, what it can do to your cheekbones?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"431722f98ffc9fa6febc39e2ad5159050d37beff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/431722f98ffc9fa6febc39e2ad5159050d37beff/0_0_6836_4562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Gold Lips window in Pat McGrath\u2019s Selfridges pop-up store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Social media gold \u2026 the Gold Lips window in Pat McGrath\u2019s Selfridges pop-up store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The British chain Boots is facing the online challenge head-on. Following reports in May that the company could close up to 200 stores over the next two years due to competition from discount retailers and online specialists, Boots has retaliated by completely overhauling its cosmetics offering. That has meant refitting 26 stores in key locations, including Sheffield, Lincoln and Hull, to make way for a \u201cbeauty playground\u201d in which cult brands such as <a href=\"https://www.fentybeauty.com/start?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIupvNut6R5AIVg7TtCh1qnAIbEAAYAiAAEgJccfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Fenty Beauty by Rihanna</a> and affordable skincare range <a href=\"https://theordinary.com/about\">The Ordinary</a> are stocked alongside stalwarts such as Revlon, Rimmel and Maybelline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e272bd5d34900ded3e6f68c9e1ff080f6d167f9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e272bd5d34900ded3e6f68c9e1ff080f6d167f9d/0_0_1508_1768/853.jpg\" alt=\"A window display for Pat McGrath Labs Selfridges pop-up store.\" width=\"853\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A window display for Pat McGrath Labs Selfridges pop-up store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShopping in-store is all about the experience,\u201d says Joanna Rogers, commercial director and vice president of beauty and gifting at Boots UK. \u201cWe\u2019ve removed the big-brand counters and replaced them with trending zones, discovery areas and live demonstration areas.\u201d In addition, a \u201cconcept\u201d store complete with YouTube studio and water refill station has also opened in Covent Garden, London, with more expected to follow around the country.</p> <p>The modern consumer looks for personalised services like customisable makeup, exclusive products and events such as live tutorials and meet-and-greets, as well as an Instagram-worthy retail environment that is enjoyable to spend time in \u2013 and to snap.<br><br>For a lesson in how to do this well, look to make-up artist Pat McGrath who, in April, debuted her eponymous cosmetics line in the UK via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/01/pat-mcgrath-labs-becomes-selfridges-biggest-selling-beauty-line\">a three-month pop-up at Selfridges\u2019 Oxford Street, London store</a>, taking over 155 square metres of its precious ground-floor space and offering tutorials with members of McGrath\u2019s team. The limited time frame in which the space was open gave it an element of exclusivity, while the physical environment was \u2013 literally \u2013 social media gold. You could shop the products online in your pyjamas, but would you have been able to take a selfie in front of a gilded sequin wall after your makeover? Selfridges achieved the best daily cosmetics sales in its history, with a Pat McGrath Labs product selling every 40 seconds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83b527f5ecaf9abb6ffbee2312333d10bcbebd2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83b527f5ecaf9abb6ffbee2312333d10bcbebd2e/0_0_6366_4800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A You Look Good mirror in the Glossier Miami store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A You Look Good mirror in the Glossier Miami store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juliana Sohn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For department stores, using the physical space wisely is particularly important. By the time the third stage of its expansion is completed in January, Harrods\u2019 new beauty hall will be 90,000 square feet in size, 53% larger than its previous home. Instead of a series of counters jostling for room, the new space is a calm, high-ceilinged emporium with a beauty concierge, world-exclusive product offering and a series of AI-powered \u201cMagic Mirrors\u201d in which customers can virtually apply makeup to their own real-life reflections. <br><br>Put simply, engaging the consumer is about generating Fomo \u2013 soothing our collective anxieties about not being up-to-speed by offering an experience that marks you out as part of the beauty scene.<br><br>This desire to be a part of the action is particularly prevalent among Generation Z. Those born since 1995 might be the most tech-savvy generation yet, growing up in the internet age, but, tellingly, beauty is the one shopping experience they prefer to undertake in person. A US study, by investment bank Piper Jaffray, found that 90% of female teens prefer to do their beauty shopping in-store.

      "bodyText": "From plumes of powder to spritzes of perfumes, the department-store beauty hall has remained in many ways unchanged since Harry Selfridge first moved personal-care products to the front of his Oxford Street store early last century. But in the face of a difficult retail landscape, with the British high street suffering closures and losses as footfall dries up, the beauty industry is fighting back against the mass exodus of consumers from bricks-and-mortar stores to online retailers. How? By putting exclusivity and experiences at the heart of its offering \u2013 whether it is receiving makeup tips directly from Pat McGrath or getting your hands on products you can\u2019t find anywhere else in the world. So far, it\u2019s working. According to market research company The NPD Group, British high-street stores still accounted for 80% of prestige beauty sales in 2018, while, in fashion, Mintel reported that online sales already made up almost a quarter of total spend back in 2017. Same-day delivery and add-to-basket ease might make online shopping the more convenient option, but when it comes to beauty, nothing quite compares to the ability to sniff, play with and try products in the flesh. Nars\u2019s new highlighter might look like any other highlighter online, but have you seen, in person, what it can do to your cheekbones? The British chain Boots is facing the online challenge head-on. Following reports in May that the company could close up to 200 stores over the next two years due to competition from discount retailers and online specialists, Boots has retaliated by completely overhauling its cosmetics offering. That has meant refitting 26 stores in key locations, including Sheffield, Lincoln and Hull, to make way for a \u201cbeauty playground\u201d in which cult brands such as Fenty Beauty by Rihanna and affordable skincare range The Ordinary are stocked alongside stalwarts such as Revlon, Rimmel and Maybelline. \u201cShopping in-store is all about the experience,\u201d says Joanna Rogers, commercial director and vice president of beauty and gifting at Boots UK. \u201cWe\u2019ve removed the big-brand counters and replaced them with trending zones, discovery areas and live demonstration areas.\u201d In addition, a \u201cconcept\u201d store complete with YouTube studio and water refill station has also opened in Covent Garden, London, with more expected to follow around the country. The modern consumer looks for personalised services like customisable makeup, exclusive products and events such as live tutorials and meet-and-greets, as well as an Instagram-worthy retail environment that is enjoyable to spend time in \u2013 and to snap. For a lesson in how to do this well, look to make-up artist Pat McGrath who, in April, debuted her eponymous cosmetics line in the UK via a three-month pop-up at Selfridges\u2019 Oxford Street, London store, taking over 155 square metres of its precious ground-floor space and offering tutorials with members of McGrath\u2019s team. The limited time frame in which the space was open gave it an element of exclusivity, while the physical environment was \u2013 literally \u2013 social media gold. You could shop the products online in your pyjamas, but would you have been able to take a selfie in front of a gilded sequin wall after your makeover? Selfridges achieved the best daily cosmetics sales in its history, with a Pat McGrath Labs product selling every 40 seconds. For department stores, using the physical space wisely is particularly important. By the time the third stage of its expansion is completed in January, Harrods\u2019 new beauty hall will be 90,000 square feet in size, 53% larger than its previous home. Instead of a series of counters jostling for room, the new space is a calm, high-ceilinged emporium with a beauty concierge, world-exclusive product offering and a series of AI-powered \u201cMagic Mirrors\u201d in which customers can virtually apply makeup to their own real-life reflections. Put simply, engaging the consumer is about generating Fomo \u2013 soothing our collective anxieties about not being up-to-speed by offering an experience that marks you out as part of the beauty scene. This desire to be a part of the action is particularly prevalent among Generation Z. Those born since 1995 might be the most tech-savvy generation yet, growing up in the internet age, but, tellingly, beauty is the one shopping experience they prefer to undertake in person. A US study, by investment bank Piper Jaffray, found that 90% of female teens prefer to do their beauty shopping in-store. The pre-shopping research might take place on smartphones and laptops \u2013 80% said they look to influencers online for tips before taking the plunge \u2013 but for the purchase itself, it\u2019s all about the IRL experience. Naomi Pike is editor of the Miss Vogue section of the British Vogue website, which is aimed at Millennial and Gen Z readers.

There\u2019s little to root for, which initially made Succession a tough sell. Why, when the world mostly seems on fire, would you watch a show about a bunch of terrible, terribly rich white people amassing more wealth and power?

The show\u2019s look is prestige \u2013 detailed and expensive \u2013 yet crucially unsentimental; the characters\u2019 various humiliations make their opulent mansions and perfectly tailored suits seem far more isolating, even scornful, than aspirational. And when it comes to ensuring the veracity of the high-finance world in which the characters live and work, the show is entirely serious; it employs several expert consultants to ensure the correct use of financial terms and that characters act like billionaires (such as not ducking at what would be, to them, the familiar sound of helicopter blades). The show\u2019s writers have developed the fictional Waystar Royco\u2019s own asset, ownership, and capital structure, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/business/media/hbo-succession-business.html\">New York Times</a>, and complicated boardroom procedures play out on screen.

If Succession is a mirror, then it\u2019s one tilted a couple of degrees, refracting our world just enough to cut off buzzworthy names while giving space to the absurdity of our current moment.

Watching Succession is continually having the realization, as the star Brian Cox <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/arts/television/succession-season-2.html\">told a recent roundtable</a>, that \u201clife is ludicrous and becomes increasingly more ludicrous and you just go, well, I\u2019m part of the ludicrosity\u201d.</p> <p>The show\u2019s ludicrosity, to use Cox\u2019s non-word, comes through most effectively in its deranged humor. Armstrong\u2019s brilliantly ironic dialogue \u2013 one character dismissed words as merely \u201ccomplicated airflow\u201d \u2013 allows the viewer space to laugh at what is transparently ridiculous, in a way that is increasingly impossible off-screen. \u201cOkay so today the president said jews are stupid and got mad when he couldn\u2019t buy greenland,\u201d the comedian Megan Amram <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meganamram/status/1163995471032905728\">tweeted</a>, seriously, on Tuesday, because that\u2019s what happened \u2013 such news will necessarily be discussed far more seriously than in a tweet. In the real world, there are entire congressional investigations of an administration that continually reveals itself to be one of masterful incompetence; we have to take it seriously. In the funhouse mirror of Succession, Logan Roy\u2019s eldest son, Connor, an effete rancher with no political experience, can seriously consider running for president, and both the characters and the viewers don\u2019t need to worry about seeing it for exactly the laughable move that it is.</p> <p>For all its ludicrousness, Succession feels incredibly clear-eyed about the world it depicts, just a few degrees removed from our own. The Roys and their elite dealers are, ultimately, just people \u2013 boiled in bad water, with the same petty, occasionally inspired, vindictive instincts as the rest of us. But they\u2019re people whose tendencies for thoughtlessness and selfishness are so well rewarded, whose confidence is so calcified, who have come to believe so fully in their own compasses, that they align further and further with evil until they\u2019re indistinguishable from it. In some ways, I find that comforting \u2013 the human instinct for other humans\u2019 fallibility is far easier to grasp than boardroom procedures and asset swaps. But that\u2019s also what makes it more terrifying.</p>",

In the real world, there are entire congressional investigations of an administration that continually reveals itself to be one of masterful incompetence; we have to take it seriously. In the funhouse mirror of Succession, Logan Roy\u2019s eldest son, Connor, an effete rancher with no political experience, can seriously consider running for president, and both the characters and the viewers don\u2019t need to worry about seeing it for exactly the laughable move that it is. For all its ludicrousness, Succession feels incredibly clear-eyed about the world it depicts, just a few degrees removed from our own. The Roys and their elite dealers are, ultimately, just people \u2013 boiled in bad water, with the same petty, occasionally inspired, vindictive instincts as the rest of us. But they\u2019re people whose tendencies for thoughtlessness and selfishness are so well rewarded, whose confidence is so calcified, who have come to believe so fully in their own compasses, that they align further and further with evil until they\u2019re indistinguishable from it. In some ways, I find that comforting \u2013 the human instinct for other humans\u2019 fallibility is far easier to grasp than boardroom procedures and asset swaps. But that\u2019s also what makes it more terrifying.",

Pickett claimed management has sent out anti-union emails, distributed anti-union content in break rooms, held captive audience meetings hosted by anti-union consultants, and called security on nurses trying to engage in union activity in break rooms. \u201cIt\u2019s made it more difficult, because initially before the busting started, people were readily willing to go to meetings and talk about it,\u201d Pickett added. \u201cThere\u2019s a general kind of fear among people of what will happen if they get involved.\u201d A settlement was reached in June 2019 with the NLRB in response to several unfair labor practice charges. The settlement mandated management post signs affirming workers\u2019 rights to unionize and that management would not interfere or retaliate against nurses for doing so. \u201cThey do not suggest or imply that the hospital has acted improperly, and the Settlement Agreement specifically states that there is no admission of liability,\u201d a spokesperson for Johns Hopkins said. They denied allegations of union busting. \u201cWe are committed to maintaining our longstanding culture of collaboration and open communication with all of our employees in order to continue providing the highest quality of care.\u201d Despite intense opposition, some nurses have been successful in their union drives to gain enough support for a union election, and win. After losing a union vote in 2017, about 300 nurses at St Alexius hospital in Bismarck, North Dakota, voted to unionize in March 2019, creating the first union in the Republican-dominated state to affiliate with National Nurses United. In July , about 650 nurses at Kalispell regional medical center in Montana voted to form a union after management refused outright to recognize the union. \u201cThere were a lot of informational meetings directed at our peers who we work with, shifting blame that if the nurses unionize, we\u2019d go out of business, if the nurses unionize, they\u2019ll get everything and you won\u2019t get anything,\u201d said Mariah Connolly, a nurse at Kalispell Regional. But for some nurses, even winning a union election hasn\u2019t stopped opposition from hospital management. Some 195 nurses at the Unity center for behavioral health in Portland, Oregon voted to form a union in June 2019, yet the hospital\u2019s management company, Legacy Health, filed an appeal of the election with the NLRB in July 2019. \u201cWe won with 86% of the vote, I just don\u2019t understand what it is they\u2019re denying us now,\u201d said Amer Filipovic, who has worked as a nurse at the hospital since it first opened in 2017. He noted since the union drive at the hospital began, Legacy Health and management has pushed anti-union literature, and thrown away pro-union material distributed in break rooms. Nurses say they started organizing to form a union in response to safety problems that have plagued the hospital, chronic understaffing, and retaliation against nurses who spoke up. \u201cThe fact they continue to push back on us, appeal, and would rather spend money going to the NLRB in Washington DC than using that money on things like patient outcomes is a surprise to me,\u201d said Sara Mittelman, a nurse at the hospital\u2019s emergency department.",

      "bodyText": "Sydney\u2019s dam storage levels have dropped below 50% for the first time in more than a decade. Storages dropped to 49.7% on Thursday, a 0.4% decline on the previous week. It is the first time since 2004 \u2013 which was during the millennium drought \u2013 that dam storage levels in Sydney have fallen below 50%. Sydney has been on stage one water restrictions since May, along with the Blue Mountains and the Illawarra region. Those restrictions target outdoor water use and include limiting the watering of lawns and gardens to early morning and late afternoon. At the time of their introduction, the state\u2019s water minister, Melinda Pavey, said Sydney was experiencing some of the lowest inflows into its dams since the 1940s. While Sydney had good rainfall in June, both July and August have been below average and the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s long-term outlook for spring is for more dry conditions. Ilona Coote, a climatologist at the Bom, said the outlook for September, October and November was for lower than average rainfall right across the country, except for on the west coast. Under the metropolitan water plan, Sydney would move to level-two water restrictions when dam storage levels reach 40% but that requires a decision from the NSW government. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokeswoman for Sydney Water said the existing restrictions were helping, with water use down 7% in the month of July. She said Sydney residents were using 100 megalitres less water a day than they were a decade ago. \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that 75% of residential water use happens indoors, so we\u2019re calling on people to save water inside the home too,\u201d she said. \u201cReducing showers by one minute saves on average nine litres of water. If everyone cut a minute off their shower, collectively Sydneysiders could save 45m litres of water every day.\u201d She said Sydney Water and the government were still closely monitoring the drought and assessing ways to respond to it. Sydney\u2019s desalination plant has been delivering water to the network since March and reached full capacity in July, a few months ahead of schedule. The plant is now supplying an average of 250m litres of water a day, which is equivalent to about 15% of Sydney\u2019s water requirements. Pavey announced last week that work had started on preliminary plans to expand the plant \u201cto ensure Sydney\u2019s water supply is maintained\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Racism towards EU pupils increases Hello, I\u2019m Warren Murray, your news point-person this morning. Eastern European pupils in schools in England and Scotland have experienced increased levels of racism and xenophobia since the Brexit vote, with some accusing their teachers of failing to protect them and even joining in, according to research led by the University of Strathclyde. One pupil told researchers: \u201cAt my last school someone made xenophobic comments about my nationality and tried to burn my hair. Last year, in my current school, a group followed me around chanting \u2018Ukip\u2019 and that I should f**k off back to my country.\u201d Another said: \u201cMy teacher would say \u2018give it up for Poliski boy\u2019 and they\u2019ll all laugh. I\u2019m used to it now.\u201d Emmanuel Macron is expected to ensure the blame for any no-deal Brexit lies squarely with Boris Johnson and his government, as the two meet for a \u201cfrank\u201d working lunch today. Ahead of it, Macron said the EU had negotiated with Britain for two years and a no-deal would be the \u201cresponsibility of the British government\u201d and \u201cBritain\u2019s doing, always\u201d. Expect a smattering of Johnson\u2019s \u201cbarbarian French\u201d \u2013 which in 2013 he employed to tell a radio interviewer that if there were a Brexit referendum, \u201cI would vote to stay in\u201d. * * * Libby Squire murder arrest \u2013 A 25-year-old man is being questioned by detectives on suspicion of murdering Libby Squire, 21. The Hull University student was last seen alive around 12.09am on 1 February near her home on Wellesley Avenue, Hull, having returned home from an evening out. Her body was recovered from the Humber estuary by detectives on 20 March. Humberside police said the suspect was being questioned by detectives. * * * Climate efforts too slow \u2013 The government should discourage personal vehicle use, ban sale of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 instead of 2040, and reward energy-efficient homebuilding with stamp duty relief to meet its legally binding target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a report by cross-party MPs says. In the fight against plastic pollution, Tesco has said it will \u201creserve the right not to list\u201d products with too much non-recyclable packaging from 2020 onwards. \u201cBut to close the loop on packaging, more needs to be done,\u201d writes Dave Lewis, the Tesco CEO, in the Guardian today. \u201cWe need a standardised national collection and a truly complete and national recycling infrastructure.\u201d Separately the World Health Organization has published its assessment that based on current science microplastics in drinking water pose no known health risk to humans \u2013 but adds that further research is needed. * * * Pill plethora risk to elderly \u2013 About 7 million elderly people in the UK are at risk of life-threatening harm from medications that could clash with each other or cause dangerous side-effects, Age UK has warned. Care home residents take an average of at least eight medicines, with a one in 10 risk of a mistake; while one in five prescriptions for elderly people living at home are incorrect. They should have regular reviews of their drugs, says Age UK. Meanwhile even a small increase in light activity by older adults can reduce their risk of an early death, according to a review of eight studies covering thousands of participants wearing activity trackers. The group with the highest levels of light physical activity \u2013 achieving about 380 minutes a day \u2013 had a 62% lower risk of death than the group that did the least, according to findings published in the British Medical Journal. * * * What happened to Robert Maxwell? \u2013 Almost 30 years before Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s demise, Ghislaine Maxwell was caught up in another shocking and scandal-ridden mystery when her father drowned in the night after falling from his \u00a315m yacht off the Canary Islands. Even now there is talk of suicide, or murder \u2013 perhaps by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service. Caroline Davies reviews the life of flamboyant press baron and shyster Robert Maxwell, and the theories surrounding his death. * * * Sticky situation \u2013 Disney/Marvel and Sony have split over their arrangement for Spider-Man to appear in the Avengers movies and vice-versa. For those who don\u2019t know their SUMC from their MCU: Sony owns the film rights to Spider-Man, but a deal was struck for the character (played by Tom Holland) to appear in films of the Disney-run Marvel Cinematic Universe. Now that the relationship between the studios has broken down, and with Spider-Man\u2019s character woven in alongside Tony Stark, Captain America and the Avengers, have we seen the last of the Iron Spider? Lunchtime read: Rise and fall of Brand Trudeau Thanks to his clever use of social media, Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau was dubbed the first prime minister of the Instagram age. He cultivated an impression that he both serves the masses and is adored by them. But after four years in power, cracks in his image have started to show. Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog recently found he broke the country\u2019s conflict of interest law to try to get a giant engineering and construction firm out of a corruption trial. Far from progressive, transparent government, the scandal suggests that, like previous Canadian governments, Trudeau\u2019s administration remains in thrall to the \u201cLaurentian consensus\u201d \u2013 the web of political, business and intellectual elites in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal whose name is a nod to eastern Canada\u2019s St Lawrence river. Ahead of a federal election in October, Trudeau\u2019s approval ratings have plunged from a high of 65% in 2016 to about 32% in July. \u201cBrand Trudeau was squeaky clean and fresh and new and a different kind of politics,\u201d says Shachi Kurl, a pollster from the Angus Reid Institute. \u201cAnd it\u2019s turned out that Brand Trudeau is: \u2018Welcome to the new politics, just like the old politics.\u2019\u201d Sport Joe Root believes England are ready to pounce on the absence of Steve Smith and heap more pressure on Australia by using Jofra Archer when the third Ashes Test gets under way at Headingley today. Ben Te\u2019o has effectively brought an end to his England rugby career by signing for Toulon on a short-term contract, having been left out of Eddie Jones\u2019s World Cup squad. Manu Tuilagi has revealed how he could have avoided more than a year of his injury layoff if he had come clean regarding his initial groin problem. World Rugby has rebranded its men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cups in an effort to achieve gender neutrality in the sport. And Major League Baseball has warned its players about the \u201cvery real risk\u201d of over-the-counter sexual-enhancement pills after at least two players attributed their positive drug tests to substances found in the unregulated products. Business A serious question is hanging over the HS2 rail link project after the government launched a review into the \u00a355bn scheme with a longstanding critic on the panel. An even more mind-boggling number from the US where federal deficit will top $1tn next year, according to a congressional report. And that\u2019s before Donald Trump plans any more tax cuts or giveaways ahead of the 2020 election. On the markets, the FTSE100 is seen starting the day off about 0.1%. The pound is trundling along at $1.212 and \u20ac1.093. The papers Angela Merkel\u2019s \u201c30 days\u201d deadline for Boris Johnson to produce a workable alternative to the Irish backstop is all over the front pages, with some creative interpretations. The Mail sees the declaration as a \u201cBrexit boost for Boris\u201d and enthuses \u201cJa, we can! \u2026 Merkel says backstop CAN be ditched\u201d. The Express thinks Johnson has won a \u201cmajor concession\u201d and has the PM welcoming Merkel\u2019s \u201cblistering deadline\u201d. The Mirror, though, says in its intro that Merkel has \u201ccalled Boris Johnson\u2019s bluff\u201d and straplines the story as a \u201cBrexit ultimatum\u201d to the PM (why didn\u2019t the Mirror put \u201cChancellor meets chancer\u201d in its headline? Must try harder). The Guardian, the Telegraph, the i and the Times are all straitlaced: think various constructions involving 30 days, Brexit, deal, backstop, Johnson, Germany, Merkel \u2026 Over at the FT they\u2019re on about how lower borrowing costs have prompted calls for spending on public projects to rev up the economy, while a pic slot goes to the chancellor and the prime minister.

      "bodyText": "South Korea is considering making its own arrangements to feed its athletes at next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics, citing concerns over the safety of food from Fukushima, media reports said. In addition, South Korean sports authorities have requested that international groups be permitted to monitor radiation levels during the 2020 Games. Food safety concerns in South Korea have grown since Fukushima city was chosen to host six softball games and one baseball game next summer. Fukushima prefecture will also be the location for the start of the domestic leg of the Olympic torch relay, beginning next March. Tokyo Olympics organisers said South Korea\u2019s National Olympic Committee had sent a letter expressing concern at the possibility of produce grown in Fukushima prefecture being served to athletes in the Olympic village. \u201cNothing is more important than safety. We will seek consultations with the International Olympic Committee and others to secure our athletes\u2019 safety and ensure that the Tokyo Olympics will be held in a safe environment,\u201d the South Korean sports minister, Park Yang-woo, said this week, according to Yonhap news agency. Seoul\u2019s concerns come amid an escalating dispute with Tokyo over South Korean court rulings ordering Japanese companies to compensate Koreans who were forced to work in Japanese factories and mines before and during the second world war, when the Korean peninsula was a Japanese colony. The dispute has affected trade and cultural exchanges, while figures released this week show that the number of South Korean tourists visiting Japan fell by 7.6% year on year last month \u2013 its lowest level for almost a year \u2013 according to the Japan National Tourism Organisation. Bloomberg reported that the Korea Sport and Olympic Committee is to request international organisations such as Greenpeace be allowed to monitor radiation levels at Olympic venues. Committee officials have also drawn up plans to open a separate cafeteria exclusively for South Korean athletes to ensure that they are not served food from the region affected by radioactive fallout from the March 2011 meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The official threshold for radioactive substances in food from Fukushima is much lower than those in other parts of the world, including the European Union and the US. All food items produced in Fukushima undergo repeated inspections to ensure their safety, according to the prefectural government. \u201cWe are only shipping primary products which are certified to be safe through multiple inspections in each stage with cooperation among municipal and prefectural government, production areas, producers, distributors and retailers,\u201d it says on its website. Data from the NGO monitoring group Safecast shows that atmospheric radiation levels in Tokyo are lower than those in many other cities. On Thursday morning, Safecast data showed levels in the Roppongi district of Tokyo stood at 0.084 microsieverts per hour, compared with 0.116 in Suwon, south of Seoul. In Fukushima city, located 45 miles west of the stricken nuclear power plant, atmospheric radiation was recorded at 0.100 microsieverts per hour. The global average of naturally occurring background radiation is 0.17-0.39 microsieverts per hour, according to the pro-nuclear lobby group the World Nuclear Association.",

      "body": "<p>On the last night of March 2012, Justin Trudeau climbed into a boxing ring in downtown Ottawa, the Canadian capital, intent on rescuing his public image. He was clad in a lustrous red robe, the colour of the Liberal party, for which he was then a junior member of parliament. In the opposite corner, wearing Tory blue, was a young aboriginal leader and Conservative senator named Patrick Brazeau, who is a former navy reservist and a second-degree black belt in karate. Bookies had given the lanky Trudeau, a former high school teacher, three-to-one odds against.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jul/28/justin-trudeau-and-senator-patrick-brazeau-face-off-in-2012-boxing-match-video\" title=\"\">televised match</a> was ostensibly a fundraiser for cancer research, but in Ottawa it became a sensation \u2013 a display of partisan pageantry rarely seen in the staid world of Canadian politics, where \u201cbland works\u201d had been the watchword of one long-serving provincial premier. The fight\u2019s symbolism was lost on no one: in recent years, the Conservatives had battered the Liberals, turning a narrow lead in the 2006 election into a majority government by 2011. The Liberal party, which had governed Canada for much of the 20th century, had been reduced to a historically low number of seats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/sep/09/justin-trudeau-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-political-brand-podcast\">Justin Trudeau: the rise and fall of a political brand \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trudeau ranked among the best hopes for resuscitating the Liberals and leading them back into power. But his political career, which began in earnest four years earlier, had been dogged by criticisms that he lacked substance and was riding on the coattails of his father, Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada\u2019s longest-serving prime ministers. Barbra Streisand, a former lover of Pierre\u2019s, once described him as a blend of \u201cMarlon Brando and Napoleon\u201d. In contrast, one critic had memorably dubbed Justin \u201cthe Paris Hilton of Canadian politics\u201d. A triumphant bout in the ring could help erode this perception, Trudeau figured. \u201cNever underestimate the power of symbols in today\u2019s world,\u201d he told a documentary film <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/143909623\" title=\"\">crew chronicling the fight</a>.</p> <p>Within seconds of the opening bell, Brazeau pinned Trudeau against the ropes with an onslaught of heavy jabs. But the Conservative senator soon exhausted himself. Early in the second round, Trudeau seized on the opening, raining down blows on Brazeau. Less than a minute into the third round, as the Liberal MP continued to pummel his opponent, the referee halted the fight and declared Trudeau the winner.</p> <p>That victory was one of the first major triumphs in a branding campaign that helped to transform Trudeau from a politician widely derided as a lightweight into a global political superstar. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t random,\u201d Trudeau told Rolling Stone in 2017, referring to the boxing match. \u201cI wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy, tough-guy senator from an Indigenous community \u2026 I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jul/28/justin-trudeau-and-senator-patrick-brazeau-face-off-in-2012-boxing-match-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/7v2n9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3722175\"            data-video-name=\"Justin Trudeau and Senator Patrick Brazeau face off in 2012 boxing match  \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"LCN Canada\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-597a7d17e4b0cc197665c141\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12331576&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12331576&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12331576&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jul/28/justin-trudeau-and-senator-patrick-brazeau-face-off-in-2012-boxing-match-video\">Justin Trudeau and Senator Patrick Brazeau face off in 2012 boxing match</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the weeks after the fight, the Canadian media, which had previously portrayed the Liberal MP as a \u201creed-thin, pedigreed Dauphin\u201d, began lauding Trudeau as a public figure of \u201ctoughness, strength, honour and courage\u201d, noted Elise Maiolino, then a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Toronto, after analysing hundreds of news articles. That change in perception electrified Trudeau\u2019s career, helping to set him on a path to become leader of the Liberal party the following year. Two years after that, in 2015, the Liberals made an unprecedented leap from third-party status to a majority government \u2013 and Trudeau became, like his father before him, the prime minister of Canada.</p> <p>The sort of potent spectacle that characterised his fight with Brazeau was, until recently, a hallmark of Trudeau\u2019s tenure as prime minister. Like Barack Obama, Trudeau seemed to understand better than other politicians how to adapt the old ideas of political marketeering to the new realities of social media. He was a master of the viral video clip or poignant photo that seemed to express the worthiness of his government and the virtue of his politics. He became, as a flurry of academic research has put it, the first prime minister of the Instagram age. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably the best national leader since Ronald Reagan at projecting a certain image,\u201d says Warren Kinsella, a former Liberal strategist.</p> <p>Trudeau has championed a vision of Canada as a nation friendly to allies, open to immigrants and just to its people. According to this image, Canada is a paragon of progressivism in an era marked by strains of authoritarian populism \u2013 as if crossing the border that separates Canada from Donald Trump\u2019s US means travelling through a political looking-glass. And yet, Trudeau was never exactly anti-populist: he cultivated an impression that he both serves the masses and is adored by them.</p> <p>Ironically, but perhaps inevitably, Trudeau\u2019s efforts to depict himself in this way have now helped to set the stage for his potential unmaking. Some of the policies enacted by Trudeau\u2019s government have made his political identity seem hollow, even disingenuous. Compounding this has been the ongoing fallout from the most significant controversy of his tenure: Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog recently found that Trudeau broke the country\u2019s conflict of interest law in the hopes of allowing a giant engineering and construction firm to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/trudeau-broke-ethics-law-in-snc-lavalin-case-watchdog-rules\" title=\"\">avoid a corruption trial</a>. The company is facing charges in connection with millions of dollars in bribes allegedly paid to officials in Libya, including members of the Gaddafi regime, between 2001 and 2011.</p> <p>Far from the progressive, transparent government that Trudeau sold to Canadians and the global media, the scandal suggests that, like previous Canadian governments, Trudeau\u2019s administration remains in thrall to the \u201cLaurentian consensus\u201d \u2013 the web of political, business and intellectual elites in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal whose collective name is a nod to eastern Canada\u2019s mighty St Lawrence river. Ahead of a federal election in October, Trudeau\u2019s approval ratings have plunged from a high of 65% in 2016 to about 32% in July, leaving him vulnerable to becoming the first Canadian prime minister since the 1930s to lose a bid for re-election after winning only one majority mandate.</p> <p>\u201cBrand Trudeau was squeaky clean and fresh and new and a different kind of politics,\u201d says Shachi Kurl, a pollster from the Angus Reid Institute. \u201cAnd it\u2019s turned out that Brand Trudeau is: \u2018Welcome to the new politics, just like the old politics.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In an age of constant and intimate exposure to celebrities, it may seem unsurprising that the head of government of a country containing less than half of 1% of the world\u2019s population should be so familiar. But how many other Canadian prime ministers have been profiled in the New York Times Magazine, Vogue and Rolling Stone? How many other Canadian prime ministers can most non-Canadians even name, let alone call to mind an image of? </p> <p>One of the extraordinary things about Trudeau is that he is famous in part because he is Canadian \u2013 a remarkably rare kind of fame. Most Canadians who are famous outside of the country have been processed through Hollywood or the US-dominated recording industry. Part of Trudeau\u2019s appeal within Canada, then, is that he assuaged a dual sense of cultural insecurity and superiority, especially with regard to the country\u2019s belligerent southern neighbour. (The majority of Canadians see Trudeau\u2019s fame as a net benefit to the country, according to the Angus Reid Institute.) On the global stage he presented a sort of ideal form \u2013 likable, handsome, virtuous \u2013 in which the country could see its best self.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trudeau\u2019s distinctly Canadian appeal goes even deeper. The prime minister represents a potent idea of Canada and what it means to the world. This idea is perhaps best summed up by a campaign motto of Trudeau\u2019s father, from the late 1960s: \u201cThe just society.\u201d The idea was sold to Canadians as encompassing the protection of civil rights, economic opportunity for all, scientific remedies to environmental problems, greater autonomy for Indigenous people in Canada, and a country in which the language rights of both French and English were enshrined.</p> <p>A great deal of Trudeau\u2019s political cachet within Canada has been inherited from his father. Pierre is a towering figure in Canadian history, who liberalised laws on abortion and homosexuality, entrenched a charter of universal rights and instituted official bilingualism. The Canadian mass media guru Marshall McLuhan, a friendly adviser to Pierre throughout the 15 years he was prime minister, believed that Canada had no fixed identity, giving Pierre an opportunity to act as its \u201cunifying image\u201d. Canada could, in a sense, become what Pierre made it. Even if few Canadians subscribe to McLuhan\u2019s view, it captures something central to how Pierre framed his own tenure as prime minister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"654b710dfd7d73aba180ca50b070be9b1a551a63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/654b710dfd7d73aba180ca50b070be9b1a551a63/0_0_2892_2278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Queen with Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, father of Justin, in London in 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"788\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Queen with Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, father of Justin, in London in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Goode/Toronto Star via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The craze for Justin Trudeau during the first years of his prime ministership echoed the \u201cTrudeaumania\u201d of his father\u2019s ascent to power. Pierre, too, captured attention around the world by staging moments of spectacle \u2013 whether it was sliding down a bannister during his 1968 campaign for Liberal leader or pirouetting behind the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 1977. Pierre was \u201cpackaged and presented as a debonair anti-politician who drove sports cars and spent time with pretty women\u201d, writes Alex Marland, a scholar of Canadian political branding at Memorial University. \u201cTo cultivate an image of a pop culture phenomenon\u201d during Canada\u2019s 1968 federal election, he adds, \u201cLiberal strategists recruited young Liberal women to behave as obsessed fanatics\u201d when Pierre was in the presence of reporters.</p> <p>Justin\u2019s attempts to recreate Trudeaumania have involved wading through crowds to allow fans to snap selfies with him \u2013 while his official photographer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B03zcs7AqZL/\" title=\"\">captures the moment</a> at a slight distance. The results, posted on Instagram, feel like a record of spontaneous adulation, but are actually tightly controlled. As Marland puts it, Trudeau is executing a \u201csimilar playbook\u201d to his father\u2019s, but \u201cin different technological terrain\u201d.</p> <p>Outside the country, Trudeau has played to the world\u2019s eagerness to imagine Canada as a northern utopia untouched by the forces of nationalism and xenophobia. Within the country, however, there are many who think that Liberal Canada has never been the progressive place that Pierre and Justin tried to make it seem. The question now is whether voters believe his son has delivered more than just a good narrative.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When a political brand becomes as powerful as Trudeau\u2019s has, it is tempting to read a person\u2019s entire biography as a branding exercise. Things the politician did in their life before politics become plot points in a success story devised by a canny political operator. Ian Capstick, a political commentator who has worked for the Liberals as well as their rivals to the left, the New Democratic party, believes that Trudeau and his longtime friend and adviser Gerald Butts \u201chave been carefully calculating every single entree of Mr Trudeau into Canadian public life for the past 30 years\u201d. He adds: \u201cThere is not a single action that he took publicly that wasn\u2019t considered, reconsidered and put out there in an attempt to eventually build the base that he would require to be prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>Even if this view is a little too cynical, there is no doubt that living his entire life in the public eye has endowed Trudeau with an instinctive, if not infallible, sense of political optics. The beginning of his rise to power has usually been dated to 3 October 2000, when the 28-year-old delivered a dramatic televised eulogy at his father\u2019s state funeral, closing with the words \u201cJe t\u2019aime, papa\u201d, before resting his head on his father\u2019s flag-draped coffin, his tears falling freely. Switchboards at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation lit up with more than 1,000 requests to replay the tribute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9122d0f69b7371c317760dd106fef263ce918fee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9122d0f69b7371c317760dd106fef263ce918fee/0_0_2048_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau (third from right) and other family members at his father Pierre Trudeau\u2019s state funeral in Montreal in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Trudeau and other family members at his father Pierre Trudeau\u2019s state funeral in Montreal in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Best/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Immediately, there was talk of the younger Trudeau entering politics, but many observers felt he lacked gravitas. He had spent his mid-20s drifting between stints as a bar bouncer and snowboard instructor before becoming a schoolteacher. He even admitted, or pretended, to an ignorance of current affairs. \u201cI don\u2019t read the newspapers, I don\u2019t watch the news,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/justin-trudeau-like-his-peers-seeks-politics-without-politics/article1337650/\" title=\"\">he wrote</a> in the Globe and Mail the year after his father\u2019s death. \u201cI figure, if something important happens, someone will tell me.\u201d</p> <p>Trudeau finally entered politics in 2007, when he began running for parliament in the riding of Papineau, a multicultural district in Montreal, which was represented at the time by a Quebec-nationalist party. During the election in 2008, he grasped something in miniature that Obama demonstrated on a larger scale that same year: that a political brand is not sufficient in and of itself \u2013 you also need a political operation. (Trump, who may not have had much of a grassroots campaign by comparison, is proof of how far such operations have moved to social media.) Trudeau won after mounting a year-long effort to knock on doors and shake hands in the district.</p> <p>It was an impressive start, but Trudeau\u2019s subsequent four years as an MP were generally seen as insipid. It wasn\u2019t until his rout of the Conservative senator Brazeau in the boxing match in 2012 that the larger political tide began to turn for him. Three years later, Trudeau\u2019s fight to become prime minister made his father\u2019s brand his own.</p> <p>In the 2015 general election, Trudeau married the values of the just society with the electoral approach pioneered by Obama, building the infrastructure for a grassroots effort while mounting an aggressive social media campaign. But Trudeau relied more heavily than Obama could on images. \u201cObama\u2019s use of social media was, for lack of a better term, pre-visual,\u201d says Tamara Small, a political science professor at Ontario\u2019s University of Guelph.</p> <p>The election pitted Trudeau against Stephen Harper, a dour Conservative who had governed Canada for nearly a decade. Few expected much of Trudeau, the neophyte leader of Canada\u2019s third-ranked party. \u201cI think that if he comes on stage with his pants on, he will probably exceed expectations,\u201d a Conservative spokesperson told reporters before the first debate. In one famous attack advert, Conservatives labelled Trudeau as \u201cjust not ready\u201d, while mockingly conceding that he has \u201cnice hair, though\u201d.</p> <p>But many Canadians already felt a deep connection to Trudeau. \u201cHe has grown up in the public eye. He was literally born while his father was prime minister,\u201d Marland told me. \u201cHe was a celebrity before he even became prime minister.\u201d This made Trudeau seem regal, yet familiar \u2013 a brand you knew and could trust. Trudeau\u2019s team did everything they could to encourage this intimate connection with their candidate. \u201cIt was probably Canada\u2019s first celebrity politics federal election,\u201d says Huguette Young, a veteran Ottawa journalist and author of Justin Trudeau: The Natural Heir. \u201cThey had Dinner with Justin, just like Dinner with Obama, and contests and you could win a date with Justin. He was almost commodified as a product.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4719792fa0470a4f130758ef780cf66a0ca579dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4719792fa0470a4f130758ef780cf66a0ca579dd/0_0_3500_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau at an election rally in Ottawa in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau at an election rally in Ottawa in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Doyle/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTrudeau really built his brand in order to counter the brand of Harper,\u201d says Vincent Raynauld, a professor at Boston\u2019s Emerson College who studies Canadian politics. In contrast to his opponent, who was seen as icy and remote, Trudeau promised a return to \u201csunny ways\u201d \u2013 the motto of a much-admired prime minister from the turn of the 20th century. While Harper mooted banning the niqab at Canadian citizenship ceremonies and launching a hotline to ferret out what his party called \u201cbarbaric cultural practices\u201d, Trudeau made a passionate defence of multiculturalism and immigration.</p> <p>These were only two of the areas in which Trudeau promised to \u201cdo politics differently\u201d. In a country where women make up just 26% of MPs, he promised to usher in a new age of gender equality \u2013 beginning by naming a cabinet comprised of as many women as men. In what would have constituted a direct challenge to his own party\u2019s dominance, Trudeau pledged to make space for smaller political parties by reforming Canada\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system. He vowed to reset the country\u2019s relationship with its disproportionately disadvantaged Indigenous peoples. All in all, the Liberal manifesto made 353 specific policy promises.</p> <p>After almost a decade of Harper, there was a widespread desire for change. Presented with two very different images of Canada\u2019s future, voters responded with a clear answer. On 19 October 2015, the Liberal party swept back to power by picking up 148 seats on top of the 36 they already held in Canada\u2019s 338-member parliament. It was the largest increase in seats in Canadian history.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As Trudeau took office, his focus on optics was on full display. The often sedate swearing-in of a new government was thrown open to the public and turned into a highly stage-managed, live-streamed event. Trudeau was due to arrive by coach at the prime minister\u2019s official residence, 24 Sussex Drive, where he spent his childhood. (The house has been under renovation since Trudeau took office, and he and his family have been living in a 22-room guest house nearby.) To avoid any inelegant photos or video \u2013 \u201cGetting off a bus is such an ugly shot,\u201d Trudeau told his communications director that morning, in comments captured by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation \u2013 Trudeau\u2019s team misled the media about where they should meet the new prime minister, ensuring that the first images the press got were of him strolling from 24 Sussex to the governor general\u2019s official residence, Rideau Hall, where the ceremony would take place. At another point that morning, Trudeau and his team were preparing to respond to the question of why he was appointing a gender-balanced cabinet. \u201cI think just calling people\u2019s attention to the year is all you really need to say,\u201d Gerald Butts, Trudeau\u2019s right-hand man, told him. The advice yielded one of Trudeau\u2019s most internationally famous lines: \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d</p> <p>Around the same time, Trudeau\u2019s team was courting international attention, prioritising interviews with the New York Times and a sultry photoshoot for Vogue with his wife, Sophie, over interviews with Canadian media. \u201cThat was very, very deliberate,\u201d said Susan Delacourt, a journalist at the Toronto Star. \u201cThere was a sense that Canadians would like that.\u201d Many Canadians initially did, interpreting the attention as a sign of Trudeau\u2019s place among progressive world leaders at a time when Obama was still president and Hillary Clinton seemed poised to succeed him, Delacourt added.</p> <p>Trudeau moved his official photographer into an office two doors down from his own. A mix of intimate and public photo ops \u2013 of the prime minister cuddling with pandas, greeting Syrian refugees as they landed on Canadian soil, throwing punches in a Brooklyn boxing gym \u2013 transformed Trudeau from a politician into a series of memes. During his first year in power, barely a week went by without some sort of viral moment from the prime minister that found its way into people\u2019s daily lives as they scrolled through Snapchat on the bus or perused Instagram in bed. As Trudeau content appeared on social media shorn of context, it created new realities: a rehearsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/apr/16/justin-trudeau-and-quantum-computers\" title=\"\">explanation</a> of quantum computing became a show of Trudeau\u2019s intellectual prowess; an innocuous cough on a visit to Washington DC became an example of Trudeau trolling the president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e43110b31f21ac73228ad289594ca7b03d77a527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e43110b31f21ac73228ad289594ca7b03d77a527/0_234_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau posing with high school students while out jogging in Vancouver 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau posing with high school students while out jogging in Vancouver 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters/Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A vital part of Trudeau\u2019s brand was the contrast between him and the far-right politicians gaining ground around the world. In the US, Trump was on a journey that in some ways echoed Trudeau\u2019s, parlaying his celebrity status into political power. When it came to optics, though, \u201cTrump was a gift\u201d for Trudeau, says Philippe Garneau, a corporate branding executive whose brother Marc ran against Trudeau for the Liberal leadership and is a minister in Trudeau\u2019s cabinet. \u201cI remember being worried. I said: \u2018How can we put a man who has a degree in teaching and [who taught] drama, sit him down with Angela Merkel and across from Putin?\u2019 And in walks Potus and upsets the whole apple cart,\u201d Garneau went on. \u201cSo Trudeau got lucky. He was never shown to be the youngest, newest, greenest member at the table, but rather some sort of version of youthful exuberance, enthusiasm, optimism and a lack of cynicism.\u201d</p> <p>When Trump pushed through his ban on travellers from a number of Muslim-majority countries, Trudeau tweeted that Canada would welcome those fleeing persecution, regardless of their faith. As accusations of sexual misconduct piled up against Trump, Trudeau proclaimed his own feminism in the pages of Marie Claire. As Trump vowed to put America first, Trudeau said Canada was \u201cback\u201d as a global player.</p> <p>Trudeau\u2019s contrast with Trump was successfully memefied when the two leaders met in February 2017. Trump\u2019s opening salvo with other world leaders had been an uncomfortably long, domineering handshake. Days earlier, Shinz\u014d Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, had been left reeling after a grip that dragged on for 19 seconds. Trudeau agonised for weeks about finding a technique that could show he was capable of holding his own, but which wouldn\u2019t antagonise the man now at the helm of Canada\u2019s largest trading partner.</p> <p>Eventually, he and his team decided on a combination handshake and shoulder grab. According to Politico, Trudeau and his senior aides spent part of their flight to Washington DC practising it. The rehearsal paid off: Trudeau was hailed around the world for the handshake <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/feb/14/donald-trumps-strange-handshake-style-and-how-justin-trudeau-beat-it-video-explainer\" title=\"\">he unleashed</a> on Trump. Viral videos of the seconds-long power struggle overshadowed a visit in which Trudeau stood by silently \u2013 later telling reporters that it was not his place to lecture another country \u2013 as Trump unapologetically defended his controversial travel ban.</p> <p>It was part of a pattern in which Trudeau and his team produced globally viral images that starved important political issues of oxygen. In 2017, at the height of an opioid epidemic that had claimed a record number of overdose victims in Vancouver, Trudeau\u2019s official photographer took an opportunistic photo of the prime minister running past a crowd of high schoolers on their prom night. Criticisms that the Trudeau government had not done enough to address the opioid crisis were buried by viral photos of the prime minister in running shorts and a T-shirt surrounded by students in suits and floor-length gowns. In politics, however, reality has a way of catching up with you. Eventually, the scandal, instead of the photo op, is what goes viral.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In retrospect, it seems predictable that a brand so well-devised, so symbolic and emotive, would encourage idealisations that in reality no politician could match. In 2018, some three years after Trudeau took power, cracks began showing in Trudeau\u2019s glossy veneer. In February, Trudeau and his family made an eight-day visit to India that was described to me by his former foreign policy adviser, Roland Paris, as perhaps \u201cthe worst trip that a Canadian prime minister has ever taken abroad\u201d. Although Trudeau sat down with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, and attended a handful of other bilateral meetings, what gained traction on social media were photos of the prime minister flouncing around in traditional Indian outfits. The result was a trip that seemed heavy on Bhangra moves but light on official business.</p> <p>\u201cIndia crystallised a lot of misgivings that liberals had that he was perhaps not as mature as we would like, he was not as prime ministerial as we would like, he was a little gimmicky and not taking it seriously with the world\u2019s largest democracy,\u201d Warren Kinsella, the former Liberal strategist, told me. Months later, Trudeau\u2019s feminist credentials took a hit after an allegation resurfaced that he had groped a reporter at an event in 2000. While acknowledging that he did apologise at the time to the reporter after she confronted him, Trudeau <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/06/trudeau-i-apologised-at-once-to-reporter-behind-groping-claim-canada-2000-music-festival\" title=\"\">has said</a> he is confident that he did not act inappropriately. Criticism grew that Trudeau\u2019s government was merely tinkering around the edges of change, masking their political inaction with a steady diet of unexpected moments and big talk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3cb7af74e118d5bb21473022ef5bbe8c3891b45e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cb7af74e118d5bb21473022ef5bbe8c3891b45e/0_0_3937_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trudeau with his wife and children in Amritsar, India in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau with his wife and children in Amritsar, India in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Narinder Nanu/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done check box, check box, check box,\u201d says Celina Caesar-Chavannes, an MP and former parliamentary secretary to the prime minister who resigned from the Liberal caucus after a dispute with Trudeau. \u201cBut how does it really transform the lives of people who don\u2019t have Trudeau\u2019s privilege, who don\u2019t have my privilege?\u201d Caesar-Chavannes argues that Trudeau\u2019s government has made small changes but consistently shies away from the bold, transformational work he promised in a campaign built around the slogan, \u201cReal Change\u201d. \u201cI think there were some decisions around our ability to be re-elected as opposed to doing politics differently,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Caesar-Chavannes gave me a number of examples of this sort of policymaking. Trudeau\u2019s government legalised marijuana but rebuffed a call to expunge the records of those convicted of simple possession, even though prosecutions had disproportionately targeted people with low-incomes and Canadians of colour. Trudeau appointed a gender-balanced cabinet, but refused to reform the country\u2019s electoral system, which would have paved the way for more female lawmakers. He promised a \u201ctotal renewal\u201d of Canada\u2019s relationship with Indigenous communities, but his government has done little to address the mould-ridden housing and lack of clean drinking water that has left many Indigenous communities living in \u201cHaiti at -40C\u201d, as a politician from the New Democratic party has put it. After vowing to prioritise the fight against climate change and criticising Saudi Arabia\u2019s treatment of human rights advocates, Trudeau\u2019s government bought a C$4.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) pipeline to better transport Alberta\u2019s landlocked bitumen to international markets and signed off on the sale of more than 900 armoured vehicles to Riyadh. And, after much of the international hype over its welcoming stance on refugees had died down, the government quietly introduced legislation this April that makes it harder for some migrants to seek asylum.</p> <p>Despite Trudeau selling himself as an open and transparent leader, several sources within the government described the centralisation of power in his office, with the prime minister\u2019s inner circle playing the role of his gatekeepers. This is typical of highly branded politicians \u2013 the pressure to keep the whole government on message encourages top-down control \u2013 but Trudeau may have taken it to an extreme. St\u00e9phane Dion served as Trudeau\u2019s foreign minister for 14 months, and during that time he didn\u2019t manage to land a single one-on-one meeting with the prime minister despite multiple requests, says Jocelyn Coulon, a former senior policy advisor to Dion. (Dion declined my request for a comment.)</p> <p>Trudeau\u2019s supporters point to the ways in which he has lived up to his promises. Since 2015, more than 44,000 Syrian refugees have been settled in Canada, compared with the 2,300 that Stephen Harper\u2019s government took in between 2013 and 2015. Trudeau\u2019s tenure so far has seen 278,000 children lifted out of poverty, a feat credited to the country\u2019s buoyant economy as well as a marquee child-benefit programme that provides direct funds to the country\u2019s poorest families. The government raised taxes on the top 1%, while cutting income tax for those in the middle bracket. And, while Canada is expected to fall short of its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, Trudeau and his government have taken fledgling steps towards tackling climate change with legislation mandating a price on carbon in every province.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"108d1a6bf2b2098d66da3a40a8f331336e7ddd71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/108d1a6bf2b2098d66da3a40a8f331336e7ddd71/0_327_6123_3674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trudeau facing questions from journalists in Ottawa in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau facing questions from journalists in Ottawa in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Hagberg/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps Trudeau\u2019s shortcomings wouldn\u2019t have dominated public discussion in Canada for much of this year if a single large scandal hadn\u2019t focused Canadians on the gap between Trudeau the brand and his actions while in government. In February, Trudeau was accused of trying to bully his justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, into helping SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering and construction company, avoid a corruption trial. Wilson-Raybould testified to a parliamentary committee earlier this year that Trudeau and his staff were worried that, if prosecuted, the company would move its head offices out of Montreal, potentially killing thousands of jobs and alienating voters in Quebec, home to a large number of strategically important parliamentary seats.</p> <p>Alongside the suggestion that Trudeau wanted to put his electoral success ahead of the integrity of the legal process, there was another layer to the scandal. Wilson-Raybould herself had once been a potent symbol of the Trudeau brand: she was the first Indigenous person and only the third woman to hold the post of justice minister. But the way she had been pressured by Trudeau and his team included \u201cundeniable elements of misogyny\u201d, she told the committee. Earlier this month, Canada\u2019s ethics commissioner concluded Trudeau had violated the country\u2019s ethics rules when he used his office to \u201ccircumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit\u201d Wilson-Raybould.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Canadians head to the polls in October, a central question will be whether Trudeau\u2019s image is so badly tarnished that the Liberal party\u2019s vision of Canada will seem less appealing, and less realistic, than the vision on offer by the parties to its right and left. As things stand, Trudeau\u2019s main opponent is the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer. Scheer has vowed to roll back carbon taxes, opposed UN efforts to promote global cooperation on migration and wants to move Canada\u2019s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has also appointed a former board member of Rebel Media, a far-right website that has been described as Breitbart North, as his campaign manager.</p> <p>In order to hang on to votes in the diverse suburbs that ring Toronto, which have proven decisive in recent elections, Liberals have been highlighting Scheer\u2019s divisiveness on issues of race and immigration. Trudeau has also drawn attention to the Conservative party\u2019s poor record on the climate crisis, and there are signs that he will continue using Trump\u2019s presidency to reinforce his own image as a champion of the just society. His government recently struck a deal with California to reduce vehicle emissions, while Trudeau has vocally criticised new restrictions on abortion access in a number of Republican-controlled US states.</p> <p>The prime minister is also trying to repair the damage done to his reputation by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and by the fact that he subsequently forced Wilson-Raybould and another cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, out of the Liberal caucus. \u201cWe worked really hard to try and see if there wasn\u2019t a way of continuing to move forward together,\u201d Trudeau told the audience at a Liberal fundraiser in June.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely incompatible with facts,\u201d Philpott told me. \u201cBetween 4 March when I resigned from cabinet and 2 April when I was booted out of caucus, I didn\u2019t have a single conversation with the prime minister. And I had only one phone call from someone in his office.\u201d She added: \u201cThere are times where the image and the narrative that the prime minister\u2019s office wants to put out there is more important than accuracy.\u201d</p> <p>Philpott likened this to another element of Trudeau\u2019s brand that had rung false to her as a former cabinet member: \u201cThe whole listening to women, \u2018diversity is our strength\u2019, that kind of image,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet I didn\u2019t feel listened to, and my diverse views didn\u2019t feel like they had a place \u2013 those kinds of things were disappointing.\u201d Philpott is planning on running as an independent in the October election, and said she now had a \u201clovely freedom\u201d from the message control that had coloured all aspects of her job as a Liberal MP.</p> <p>Those behind Trudeau roundly reject the idea of the prime minister as a highly managed brand. \u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019s not a Nike sneaker,\u201d says Kate Purchase, his executive director of communications and planning, whose responsibilities include vetting posts for his social media accounts. \u201cHe is a leader.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/20/emmanuel-macron-orbiting-jupiter-emmanuel-carrere\">Orbiting Jupiter: my week with Emmanuel Macron</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Purchase pointed to the issues Trudeau addresses, from the anxiety of the middle class to diversity and inclusion, to explain his meteoric rise on the world stage. \u201cThose are things that many governments are struggling with,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will always describe what they believe the brand to be, and what their version of the brand is, but at the end of the day, I think our brand is what we\u2019ve delivered.\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks, polls suggest the Liberals have halted their plunge, and are slowly regaining some support. Still, an extraordinary challenge lies head for Trudeau and his team as they head into the October election, says the pollster Shachi Kurl. \u201cHow do you course-correct from something that is less about an event or a policy that people disagree with, and more about a broken brand?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the last night of March 2012, Justin Trudeau climbed into a boxing ring in downtown Ottawa, the Canadian capital, intent on rescuing his public image. He was clad in a lustrous red robe, the colour of the Liberal party, for which he was then a junior member of parliament. In the opposite corner, wearing Tory blue, was a young aboriginal leader and Conservative senator named Patrick Brazeau, who is a former navy reservist and a second-degree black belt in karate. Bookies had given the lanky Trudeau, a former high school teacher, three-to-one odds against. The televised match was ostensibly a fundraiser for cancer research, but in Ottawa it became a sensation \u2013 a display of partisan pageantry rarely seen in the staid world of Canadian politics, where \u201cbland works\u201d had been the watchword of one long-serving provincial premier. The fight\u2019s symbolism was lost on no one: in recent years, the Conservatives had battered the Liberals, turning a narrow lead in the 2006 election into a majority government by 2011. The Liberal party, which had governed Canada for much of the 20th century, had been reduced to a historically low number of seats. Trudeau ranked among the best hopes for resuscitating the Liberals and leading them back into power. But his political career, which began in earnest four years earlier, had been dogged by criticisms that he lacked substance and was riding on the coattails of his father, Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada\u2019s longest-serving prime ministers. Barbra Streisand, a former lover of Pierre\u2019s, once described him as a blend of \u201cMarlon Brando and Napoleon\u201d. In contrast, one critic had memorably dubbed Justin \u201cthe Paris Hilton of Canadian politics\u201d. A triumphant bout in the ring could help erode this perception, Trudeau figured. \u201cNever underestimate the power of symbols in today\u2019s world,\u201d he told a documentary film crew chronicling the fight. Within seconds of the opening bell, Brazeau pinned Trudeau against the ropes with an onslaught of heavy jabs. But the Conservative senator soon exhausted himself. Early in the second round, Trudeau seized on the opening, raining down blows on Brazeau. Less than a minute into the third round, as the Liberal MP continued to pummel his opponent, the referee halted the fight and declared Trudeau the winner. That victory was one of the first major triumphs in a branding campaign that helped to transform Trudeau from a politician widely derided as a lightweight into a global political superstar. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t random,\u201d Trudeau told Rolling Stone in 2017, referring to the boxing match. \u201cI wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy, tough-guy senator from an Indigenous community \u2026 I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.\u201d In the weeks after the fight, the Canadian media, which had previously portrayed the Liberal MP as a \u201creed-thin, pedigreed Dauphin\u201d, began lauding Trudeau as a public figure of \u201ctoughness, strength, honour and courage\u201d, noted Elise Maiolino, then a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Toronto, after analysing hundreds of news articles. That change in perception electrified Trudeau\u2019s career, helping to set him on a path to become leader of the Liberal party the following year. Two years after that, in 2015, the Liberals made an unprecedented leap from third-party status to a majority government \u2013 and Trudeau became, like his father before him, the prime minister of Canada. The sort of potent spectacle that characterised his fight with Brazeau was, until recently, a hallmark of Trudeau\u2019s tenure as prime minister. Like Barack Obama, Trudeau seemed to understand better than other politicians how to adapt the old ideas of political marketeering to the new realities of social media. He was a master of the viral video clip or poignant photo that seemed to express the worthiness of his government and the virtue of his politics. He became, as a flurry of academic research has put it, the first prime minister of the Instagram age. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably the best national leader since Ronald Reagan at projecting a certain image,\u201d says Warren Kinsella, a former Liberal strategist. Trudeau has championed a vision of Canada as a nation friendly to allies, open to immigrants and just to its people. According to this image, Canada is a paragon of progressivism in an era marked by strains of authoritarian populism \u2013 as if crossing the border that separates Canada from Donald Trump\u2019s US means travelling through a political looking-glass. And yet, Trudeau was never exactly anti-populist: he cultivated an impression that he both serves the masses and is adored by them. Ironically, but perhaps inevitably, Trudeau\u2019s efforts to depict himself in this way have now helped to set the stage for his potential unmaking. Some of the policies enacted by Trudeau\u2019s government have made his political identity seem hollow, even disingenuous. Compounding this has been the ongoing fallout from the most significant controversy of his tenure: Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog recently found that Trudeau broke the country\u2019s conflict of interest law in the hopes of allowing a giant engineering and construction firm to avoid a corruption trial. The company is facing charges in connection with millions of dollars in bribes allegedly paid to officials in Libya, including members of the Gaddafi regime, between 2001 and 2011. Far from the progressive, transparent government that Trudeau sold to Canadians and the global media, the scandal suggests that, like previous Canadian governments, Trudeau\u2019s administration remains in thrall to the \u201cLaurentian consensus\u201d \u2013 the web of political, business and intellectual elites in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal whose collective name is a nod to eastern Canada\u2019s mighty St Lawrence river. Ahead of a federal election in October, Trudeau\u2019s approval ratings have plunged from a high of 65% in 2016 to about 32% in July, leaving him vulnerable to becoming the first Canadian prime minister since the 1930s to lose a bid for re-election after winning only one majority mandate. \u201cBrand Trudeau was squeaky clean and fresh and new and a different kind of politics,\u201d says Shachi Kurl, a pollster from the Angus Reid Institute. \u201cAnd it\u2019s turned out that Brand Trudeau is: \u2018Welcome to the new politics, just like the old politics.\u2019\u201d * * * In an age of constant and intimate exposure to celebrities, it may seem unsurprising that the head of government of a country containing less than half of 1% of the world\u2019s population should be so familiar. But how many other Canadian prime ministers have been profiled in the New York Times Magazine, Vogue and Rolling Stone? How many other Canadian prime ministers can most non-Canadians even name, let alone call to mind an image of? One of the extraordinary things about Trudeau is that he is famous in part because he is Canadian \u2013 a remarkably rare kind of fame. Most Canadians who are famous outside of the country have been processed through Hollywood or the US-dominated recording industry. Part of Trudeau\u2019s appeal within Canada, then, is that he assuaged a dual sense of cultural insecurity and superiority, especially with regard to the country\u2019s belligerent southern neighbour. (The majority of Canadians see Trudeau\u2019s fame as a net benefit to the country, according to the Angus Reid Institute.) On the global stage he presented a sort of ideal form \u2013 likable, handsome, virtuous \u2013 in which the country could see its best self. Trudeau\u2019s distinctly Canadian appeal goes even deeper. The prime minister represents a potent idea of Canada and what it means to the world. This idea is perhaps best summed up by a campaign motto of Trudeau\u2019s father, from the late 1960s: \u201cThe just society.\u201d The idea was sold to Canadians as encompassing the protection of civil rights, economic opportunity for all, scientific remedies to environmental problems, greater autonomy for Indigenous people in Canada, and a country in which the language rights of both French and English were enshrined. A great deal of Trudeau\u2019s political cachet within Canada has been inherited from his father. Pierre is a towering figure in Canadian history, who liberalised laws on abortion and homosexuality, entrenched a charter of universal rights and instituted official bilingualism. The Canadian mass media guru Marshall McLuhan, a friendly adviser to Pierre throughout the 15 years he was prime minister, believed that Canada had no fixed identity, giving Pierre an opportunity to act as its \u201cunifying image\u201d. Canada could, in a sense, become what Pierre made it. Even if few Canadians subscribe to McLuhan\u2019s view, it captures something central to how Pierre framed his own tenure as prime minister. The craze for Justin Trudeau during the first years of his prime ministership echoed the \u201cTrudeaumania\u201d of his father\u2019s ascent to power. Pierre, too, captured attention around the world by staging moments of spectacle \u2013 whether it was sliding down a bannister during his 1968 campaign for Liberal leader or pirouetting behind the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 1977. Pierre was \u201cpackaged and presented as a debonair anti-politician who drove sports cars and spent time with pretty women\u201d, writes Alex Marland, a scholar of Canadian political branding at Memorial University. \u201cTo cultivate an image of a pop culture phenomenon\u201d during Canada\u2019s 1968 federal election, he adds, \u201cLiberal strategists recruited young Liberal women to behave as obsessed fanatics\u201d when Pierre was in the presence of reporters. Justin\u2019s attempts to recreate Trudeaumania have involved wading through crowds to allow fans to snap selfies with him \u2013 while his official photographer captures the moment at a slight distance. The results, posted on Instagram, feel like a record of spontaneous adulation, but are actually tightly controlled. As Marland puts it, Trudeau is executing a \u201csimilar playbook\u201d to his father\u2019s, but \u201cin different technological terrain\u201d. Outside the country, Trudeau has played to the world\u2019s eagerness to imagine Canada as a northern utopia untouched by the forces of nationalism and xenophobia. Within the country, however, there are many who think that Liberal Canada has never been the progressive place that Pierre and Justin tried to make it seem. The question now is whether voters believe his son has delivered more than just a good narrative. * * * When a political brand becomes as powerful as Trudeau\u2019s has, it is tempting to read a person\u2019s entire biography as a branding exercise. Things the politician did in their life before politics become plot points in a success story devised by a canny political operator. Ian Capstick, a political commentator who has worked for the Liberals as well as their rivals to the left, the New Democratic party, believes that Trudeau and his longtime friend and adviser Gerald Butts \u201chave been carefully calculating every single entree of Mr Trudeau into Canadian public life for the past 30 years\u201d. He adds: \u201cThere is not a single action that he took publicly that wasn\u2019t considered, reconsidered and put out there in an attempt to eventually build the base that he would require to be prime minister.\u201d Even if this view is a little too cynical, there is no doubt that living his entire life in the public eye has endowed Trudeau with an instinctive, if not infallible, sense of political optics. The beginning of his rise to power has usually been dated to 3 October 2000, when the 28-year-old delivered a dramatic televised eulogy at his father\u2019s state funeral, closing with the words \u201cJe t\u2019aime, papa\u201d, before resting his head on his father\u2019s flag-draped coffin, his tears falling freely. Switchboards at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation lit up with more than 1,000 requests to replay the tribute. Immediately, there was talk of the younger Trudeau entering politics, but many observers felt he lacked gravitas. He had spent his mid-20s drifting between stints as a bar bouncer and snowboard instructor before becoming a schoolteacher. He even admitted, or pretended, to an ignorance of current affairs. \u201cI don\u2019t read the newspapers, I don\u2019t watch the news,\u201d he wrote in the Globe and Mail the year after his father\u2019s death. \u201cI figure, if something important happens, someone will tell me.\u201d Trudeau finally entered politics in 2007, when he began running for parliament in the riding of Papineau, a multicultural district in Montreal, which was represented at the time by a Quebec-nationalist party. During the election in 2008, he grasped something in miniature that Obama demonstrated on a larger scale that same year: that a political brand is not sufficient in and of itself \u2013 you also need a political operation. (Trump, who may not have had much of a grassroots campaign by comparison, is proof of how far such operations have moved to social media.) Trudeau won after mounting a year-long effort to knock on doors and shake hands in the district. It was an impressive start, but Trudeau\u2019s subsequent four years as an MP were generally seen as insipid. It wasn\u2019t until his rout of the Conservative senator Brazeau in the boxing match in 2012 that the larger political tide began to turn for him. Three years later, Trudeau\u2019s fight to become prime minister made his father\u2019s brand his own. In the 2015 general election, Trudeau married the values of the just society with the electoral approach pioneered by Obama, building the infrastructure for a grassroots effort while mounting an aggressive social media campaign. But Trudeau relied more heavily than Obama could on images. \u201cObama\u2019s use of social media was, for lack of a better term, pre-visual,\u201d says Tamara Small, a political science professor at Ontario\u2019s University of Guelph. The election pitted Trudeau against Stephen Harper, a dour Conservative who had governed Canada for nearly a decade. Few expected much of Trudeau, the neophyte leader of Canada\u2019s third-ranked party. \u201cI think that if he comes on stage with his pants on, he will probably exceed expectations,\u201d a Conservative spokesperson told reporters before the first debate. In one famous attack advert, Conservatives labelled Trudeau as \u201cjust not ready\u201d, while mockingly conceding that he has \u201cnice hair, though\u201d. But many Canadians already felt a deep connection to Trudeau. \u201cHe has grown up in the public eye. He was literally born while his father was prime minister,\u201d Marland told me. \u201cHe was a celebrity before he even became prime minister.\u201d This made Trudeau seem regal, yet familiar \u2013 a brand you knew and could trust. Trudeau\u2019s team did everything they could to encourage this intimate connection with their candidate. \u201cIt was probably Canada\u2019s first celebrity politics federal election,\u201d says Huguette Young, a veteran Ottawa journalist and author of Justin Trudeau: The Natural Heir. \u201cThey had Dinner with Justin, just like Dinner with Obama, and contests and you could win a date with Justin. He was almost commodified as a product.\u201d \u201cTrudeau really built his brand in order to counter the brand of Harper,\u201d says Vincent Raynauld, a professor at Boston\u2019s Emerson College who studies Canadian politics. In contrast to his opponent, who was seen as icy and remote, Trudeau promised a return to \u201csunny ways\u201d \u2013 the motto of a much-admired prime minister from the turn of the 20th century. While Harper mooted banning the niqab at Canadian citizenship ceremonies and launching a hotline to ferret out what his party called \u201cbarbaric cultural practices\u201d, Trudeau made a passionate defence of multiculturalism and immigration. These were only two of the areas in which Trudeau promised to \u201cdo politics differently\u201d. In a country where women make up just 26% of MPs, he promised to usher in a new age of gender equality \u2013 beginning by naming a cabinet comprised of as many women as men. In what would have constituted a direct challenge to his own party\u2019s dominance, Trudeau pledged to make space for smaller political parties by reforming Canada\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system. He vowed to reset the country\u2019s relationship with its disproportionately disadvantaged Indigenous peoples. All in all, the Liberal manifesto made 353 specific policy promises. After almost a decade of Harper, there was a widespread desire for change. Presented with two very different images of Canada\u2019s future, voters responded with a clear answer. On 19 October 2015, the Liberal party swept back to power by picking up 148 seats on top of the 36 they already held in Canada\u2019s 338-member parliament. It was the largest increase in seats in Canadian history. * * * As Trudeau took office, his focus on optics was on full display. The often sedate swearing-in of a new government was thrown open to the public and turned into a highly stage-managed, live-streamed event. Trudeau was due to arrive by coach at the prime minister\u2019s official residence, 24 Sussex Drive, where he spent his childhood. (The house has been under renovation since Trudeau took office, and he and his family have been living in a 22-room guest house nearby.) To avoid any inelegant photos or video \u2013 \u201cGetting off a bus is such an ugly shot,\u201d Trudeau told his communications director that morning, in comments captured by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation \u2013 Trudeau\u2019s team misled the media about where they should meet the new prime minister, ensuring that the first images the press got were of him strolling from 24 Sussex to the governor general\u2019s official residence, Rideau Hall, where the ceremony would take place. At another point that morning, Trudeau and his team were preparing to respond to the question of why he was appointing a gender-balanced cabinet. \u201cI think just calling people\u2019s attention to the year is all you really need to say,\u201d Gerald Butts, Trudeau\u2019s right-hand man, told him. The advice yielded one of Trudeau\u2019s most internationally famous lines: \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d Around the same time, Trudeau\u2019s team was courting international attention, prioritising interviews with the New York Times and a sultry photoshoot for Vogue with his wife, Sophie, over interviews with Canadian media. \u201cThat was very, very deliberate,\u201d said Susan Delacourt, a journalist at the Toronto Star. \u201cThere was a sense that Canadians would like that.\u201d Many Canadians initially did, interpreting the attention as a sign of Trudeau\u2019s place among progressive world leaders at a time when Obama was still president and Hillary Clinton seemed poised to succeed him, Delacourt added. Trudeau moved his official photographer into an office two doors down from his own. A mix of intimate and public photo ops \u2013 of the prime minister cuddling with pandas, greeting Syrian refugees as they landed on Canadian soil, throwing punches in a Brooklyn boxing gym \u2013 transformed Trudeau from a politician into a series of memes. During his first year in power, barely a week went by without some sort of viral moment from the prime minister that found its way into people\u2019s daily lives as they scrolled through Snapchat on the bus or perused Instagram in bed. As Trudeau content appeared on social media shorn of context, it created new realities: a rehearsed explanation of quantum computing became a show of Trudeau\u2019s intellectual prowess; an innocuous cough on a visit to Washington DC became an example of Trudeau trolling the president. A vital part of Trudeau\u2019s brand was the contrast between him and the far-right politicians gaining ground around the world. In the US, Trump was on a journey that in some ways echoed Trudeau\u2019s, parlaying his celebrity status into political power. When it came to optics, though, \u201cTrump was a gift\u201d for Trudeau, says Philippe Garneau, a corporate branding executive whose brother Marc ran against Trudeau for the Liberal leadership and is a minister in Trudeau\u2019s cabinet. \u201cI remember being worried. I said: \u2018How can we put a man who has a degree in teaching and [who taught] drama, sit him down with Angela Merkel and across from Putin?\u2019 And in walks Potus and upsets the whole apple cart,\u201d Garneau went on. \u201cSo Trudeau got lucky. He was never shown to be the youngest, newest, greenest member at the table, but rather some sort of version of youthful exuberance, enthusiasm, optimism and a lack of cynicism.\u201d When Trump pushed through his ban on travellers from a number of Muslim-majority countries, Trudeau tweeted that Canada would welcome those fleeing persecution, regardless of their faith. As accusations of sexual misconduct piled up against Trump, Trudeau proclaimed his own feminism in the pages of Marie Claire. As Trump vowed to put America first, Trudeau said Canada was \u201cback\u201d as a global player. Trudeau\u2019s contrast with Trump was successfully memefied when the two leaders met in February 2017. Trump\u2019s opening salvo with other world leaders had been an uncomfortably long, domineering handshake. Days earlier, Shinz\u014d Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, had been left reeling after a grip that dragged on for 19 seconds. Trudeau agonised for weeks about finding a technique that could show he was capable of holding his own, but which wouldn\u2019t antagonise the man now at the helm of Canada\u2019s largest trading partner. Eventually, he and his team decided on a combination handshake and shoulder grab. According to Politico, Trudeau and his senior aides spent part of their flight to Washington DC practising it. The rehearsal paid off: Trudeau was hailed around the world for the handshake he unleashed on Trump. Viral videos of the seconds-long power struggle overshadowed a visit in which Trudeau stood by silently \u2013 later telling reporters that it was not his place to lecture another country \u2013 as Trump unapologetically defended his controversial travel ban. It was part of a pattern in which Trudeau and his team produced globally viral images that starved important political issues of oxygen. In 2017, at the height of an opioid epidemic that had claimed a record number of overdose victims in Vancouver, Trudeau\u2019s official photographer took an opportunistic photo of the prime minister running past a crowd of high schoolers on their prom night. Criticisms that the Trudeau government had not done enough to address the opioid crisis were buried by viral photos of the prime minister in running shorts and a T-shirt surrounded by students in suits and floor-length gowns. In politics, however, reality has a way of catching up with you. Eventually, the scandal, instead of the photo op, is what goes viral. * * * In retrospect, it seems predictable that a brand so well-devised, so symbolic and emotive, would encourage idealisations that in reality no politician could match. In 2018, some three years after Trudeau took power, cracks began showing in Trudeau\u2019s glossy veneer. In February, Trudeau and his family made an eight-day visit to India that was described to me by his former foreign policy adviser, Roland Paris, as perhaps \u201cthe worst trip that a Canadian prime minister has ever taken abroad\u201d. Although Trudeau sat down with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, and attended a handful of other bilateral meetings, what gained traction on social media were photos of the prime minister flouncing around in traditional Indian outfits. The result was a trip that seemed heavy on Bhangra moves but light on official business. \u201cIndia crystallised a lot of misgivings that liberals had that he was perhaps not as mature as we would like, he was not as prime ministerial as we would like, he was a little gimmicky and not taking it seriously with the world\u2019s largest democracy,\u201d Warren Kinsella, the former Liberal strategist, told me. Months later, Trudeau\u2019s feminist credentials took a hit after an allegation resurfaced that he had groped a reporter at an event in 2000. While acknowledging that he did apologise at the time to the reporter after she confronted him, Trudeau has said he is confident that he did not act inappropriately. Criticism grew that Trudeau\u2019s government was merely tinkering around the edges of change, masking their political inaction with a steady diet of unexpected moments and big talk. \u201cWe\u2019ve done check box, check box, check box,\u201d says Celina Caesar-Chavannes, an MP and former parliamentary secretary to the prime minister who resigned from the Liberal caucus after a dispute with Trudeau. \u201cBut how does it really transform the lives of people who don\u2019t have Trudeau\u2019s privilege, who don\u2019t have my privilege?\u201d Caesar-Chavannes argues that Trudeau\u2019s government has made small changes but consistently shies away from the bold, transformational work he promised in a campaign built around the slogan, \u201cReal Change\u201d. \u201cI think there were some decisions around our ability to be re-elected as opposed to doing politics differently,\u201d she says. Caesar-Chavannes gave me a number of examples of this sort of policymaking. Trudeau\u2019s government legalised marijuana but rebuffed a call to expunge the records of those convicted of simple possession, even though prosecutions had disproportionately targeted people with low-incomes and Canadians of colour. Trudeau appointed a gender-balanced cabinet, but refused to reform the country\u2019s electoral system, which would have paved the way for more female lawmakers. He promised a \u201ctotal renewal\u201d of Canada\u2019s relationship with Indigenous communities, but his government has done little to address the mould-ridden housing and lack of clean drinking water that has left many Indigenous communities living in \u201cHaiti at -40C\u201d, as a politician from the New Democratic party has put it. After vowing to prioritise the fight against climate change and criticising Saudi Arabia\u2019s treatment of human rights advocates, Trudeau\u2019s government bought a C$4.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) pipeline to better transport Alberta\u2019s landlocked bitumen to international markets and signed off on the sale of more than 900 armoured vehicles to Riyadh. And, after much of the international hype over its welcoming stance on refugees had died down, the government quietly introduced legislation this April that makes it harder for some migrants to seek asylum. Despite Trudeau selling himself as an open and transparent leader, several sources within the government described the centralisation of power in his office, with the prime minister\u2019s inner circle playing the role of his gatekeepers. This is typical of highly branded politicians \u2013 the pressure to keep the whole government on message encourages top-down control \u2013 but Trudeau may have taken it to an extreme. St\u00e9phane Dion served as Trudeau\u2019s foreign minister for 14 months, and during that time he didn\u2019t manage to land a single one-on-one meeting with the prime minister despite multiple requests, says Jocelyn Coulon, a former senior policy advisor to Dion. (Dion declined my request for a comment.) Trudeau\u2019s supporters point to the ways in which he has lived up to his promises. Since 2015, more than 44,000 Syrian refugees have been settled in Canada, compared with the 2,300 that Stephen Harper\u2019s government took in between 2013 and 2015. Trudeau\u2019s tenure so far has seen 278,000 children lifted out of poverty, a feat credited to the country\u2019s buoyant economy as well as a marquee child-benefit programme that provides direct funds to the country\u2019s poorest families. The government raised taxes on the top 1%, while cutting income tax for those in the middle bracket. And, while Canada is expected to fall short of its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, Trudeau and his government have taken fledgling steps towards tackling climate change with legislation mandating a price on carbon in every province. Perhaps Trudeau\u2019s shortcomings wouldn\u2019t have dominated public discussion in Canada for much of this year if a single large scandal hadn\u2019t focused Canadians on the gap between Trudeau the brand and his actions while in government. In February, Trudeau was accused of trying to bully his justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, into helping SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering and construction company, avoid a corruption trial. Wilson-Raybould testified to a parliamentary committee earlier this year that Trudeau and his staff were worried that, if prosecuted, the company would move its head offices out of Montreal, potentially killing thousands of jobs and alienating voters in Quebec, home to a large number of strategically important parliamentary seats. Alongside the suggestion that Trudeau wanted to put his electoral success ahead of the integrity of the legal process, there was another layer to the scandal. Wilson-Raybould herself had once been a potent symbol of the Trudeau brand: she was the first Indigenous person and only the third woman to hold the post of justice minister. But the way she had been pressured by Trudeau and his team included \u201cundeniable elements of misogyny\u201d, she told the committee. Earlier this month, Canada\u2019s ethics commissioner concluded Trudeau had violated the country\u2019s ethics rules when he used his office to \u201ccircumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit\u201d Wilson-Raybould. * * * When Canadians head to the polls in October, a central question will be whether Trudeau\u2019s image is so badly tarnished that the Liberal party\u2019s vision of Canada will seem less appealing, and less realistic, than the vision on offer by the parties to its right and left. As things stand, Trudeau\u2019s main opponent is the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer. Scheer has vowed to roll back carbon taxes, opposed UN efforts to promote global cooperation on migration and wants to move Canada\u2019s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has also appointed a former board member of Rebel Media, a far-right website that has been described as Breitbart North, as his campaign manager. In order to hang on to votes in the diverse suburbs that ring Toronto, which have proven decisive in recent elections, Liberals have been highlighting Scheer\u2019s divisiveness on issues of race and immigration. Trudeau has also drawn attention to the Conservative party\u2019s poor record on the climate crisis, and there are signs that he will continue using Trump\u2019s presidency to reinforce his own image as a champion of the just society. His government recently struck a deal with California to reduce vehicle emissions, while Trudeau has vocally criticised new restrictions on abortion access in a number of Republican-controlled US states. The prime minister is also trying to repair the damage done to his reputation by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and by the fact that he subsequently forced Wilson-Raybould and another cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, out of the Liberal caucus. \u201cWe worked really hard to try and see if there wasn\u2019t a way of continuing to move forward together,\u201d Trudeau told the audience at a Liberal fundraiser in June. \u201cThat\u2019s completely incompatible with facts,\u201d Philpott told me. \u201cBetween 4 March when I resigned from cabinet and 2 April when I was booted out of caucus, I didn\u2019t have a single conversation with the prime minister. And I had only one phone call from someone in his office.\u201d She added: \u201cThere are times where the image and the narrative that the prime minister\u2019s office wants to put out there is more important than accuracy.\u201d Philpott likened this to another element of Trudeau\u2019s brand that had rung false to her as a former cabinet member: \u201cThe whole listening to women, \u2018diversity is our strength\u2019, that kind of image,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet I didn\u2019t feel listened to, and my diverse views didn\u2019t feel like they had a place \u2013 those kinds of things were disappointing.\u201d Philpott is planning on running as an independent in the October election, and said she now had a \u201clovely freedom\u201d from the message control that had coloured all aspects of her job as a Liberal MP. Those behind Trudeau roundly reject the idea of the prime minister as a highly managed brand. \u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019s not a Nike sneaker,\u201d says Kate Purchase, his executive director of communications and planning, whose responsibilities include vetting posts for his social media accounts. \u201cHe is a leader.\u201d Purchase pointed to the issues Trudeau addresses, from the anxiety of the middle class to diversity and inclusion, to explain his meteoric rise on the world stage. \u201cThose are things that many governments are struggling with,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will always describe what they believe the brand to be, and what their version of the brand is, but at the end of the day, I think our brand is what we\u2019ve delivered.\u201d In recent weeks, polls suggest the Liberals have halted their plunge, and are slowly regaining some support. Still, an extraordinary challenge lies head for Trudeau and his team as they head into the October election, says the pollster Shachi Kurl. \u201cHow do you course-correct from something that is less about an event or a policy that people disagree with, and more about a broken brand?\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

There is a systematic campaign to delegitimise the very few leftwing voices in the mainstream media and politics, orchestrated not just by the right, but by some self-described \u201cmoderates\u201d and \u201ccentrists\u201d too. The attempt to construct a false equivalence between a far right that is on a murderous rampage against minorities and their allies, and a left committed to resisting its hatred and violence, is perverse. Mainstream politicians and several media outlets are legitimising ideas that fuel ideologically driven far-right terrorism and violent racist and bigoted attacks. Many more will be injured, and will die, as a consequence, and because they are not white, and because they lack a national platform, you will probably never hear their names. \u2022Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

The other four days the couple are usually out chasing pythons as members of Patric: the <a href=\"https://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/nonnatives/python/action-team/\">Python Action Team </a><a href=\"https://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/nonnatives/python/action-team/\">\u2013 Removing Invasive Constrictors</a>, which is managed by the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (FWC).</p> <p>Koehler and Van Gorder\u2019s love affair with Burmese pythons began in 2016, when the FWC held its second python challenge.

Those who had caught the most and also the longest pythons shared in over $16,000 of prizes.</p> <p>\u201cWe usually achieve our goals,\u201d Koehler says, still disappointed by their efforts in the challenge. Determined, they acquired another permit (no longer required for 22 FWC-managed areas as of 2017, when the commission declared <a href=\"https://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/nonnatives/python/pickup/\">open season</a> on pythons) and kept looking for another two months, until they came across an eight-footer. \u201cMy heart stopped,\u201d Van Gorder recalls, though now the size seems, to both of them, almost quaint.</p> <p>Burmese pythons have no natural predators here. They do, however, have an uncanny ability to swallow things significantly larger than their own heads. Able to grow to more than 20ft in length, these stealthy invaders ambush their prey, squeeze until the prey stops breathing and then split their jaw apart to take the prey whole. They can inflict a nasty wound on humans \u2013 when Van Gorder was bitten, it took five months for one of the broken teeth to work its way out \u2013 but the chances of anything more serious happening are slim (though <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/gone-viral/os-giant-snake-swallows-man-0330-story.html\">not impossible</a>). Masters of camouflage, they can slide by an eagle-eyed biologist in just a few inches of water, and they can cover huge distances. One was recently discovered coiled up on a floating crab pot more than 15 miles out to sea.</p> <p>It\u2019s estimated that there are <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-many-burmese-pythons-inhabit-southern-florida?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products\">tens of thousands</a> of pythons now living in the Florida wild. A 2012 study in the Everglades suggested that <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/109/7/2418\">a disturbing number of mammals have been swallowed</a> by the invasive species: a spike in python sightings since 2000 coincided with a more than 90% reduction in raccoons, opossums and rabbits.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just the smaller, soft animals who have been attacked. In December 2016, a YouTube video showed a Burmese python in Big Cypress national preserve, next to the Everglades, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODjCgBl-nJ0\">strangling an alligator</a>. This viral video led the executive director of the South Florida water management district, who was horrified by what he saw, to create the district\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.sfwmd.gov/our-work/python-program\">Python Elimination Program</a>, in 2017. \u201cHe said he wanted to put 25 outdoorsmen with guns out in the field,\u201d recalls Mike Kirkland, an invasive animal biologist who was charged with assembling the original team.</p> <p>Damage done by the pythons to south Florida ecosystems has become so acute in recent years that the quest to stop has turned into a collective crusade. Wildlife biologists, government agencies, zoos and universities are deploying a full arsenal of responses, from telemetry tracking to early research into pheromone manipulation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"825ecaf87a0ae8d348d1ac392b8a19f9c2fbb613\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/825ecaf87a0ae8d348d1ac392b8a19f9c2fbb613/0_0_4608_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An American alligator in its natural habitat in the Florida Everglades.

These individuals must be over 18, and they must pass a stringent vetting process. Once licensed as professionals, they are charged with removing pythons from a patchwork quilt of district, state and federal lands that also, in the case of the Python Action Team, includes Everglades national park, which is off-limits to non-Patric hunters. The issue is also on the minds of ordinary citizens who haven\u2019t been officially tasked with stalking the species. When I mentioned the pythons in passing to a well-known Florida author, he emailed back a photo of himself holding up one he\u2019d recently shot. \u201cThem damn pythons,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Koehler and Van Gorder applied to the FWC and were accepted on the second round. They found a hatchling their first night on the job. \u201cNobody\u2019s doing this for the money,\u201d Van Gorder says, though team members are paid for their time and effort. Instead, she sees it as an act of community service. A self-described \u201carmy brat\u201d, she is not really from anywhere. But she feels like she finally has a home in Florida. Catching the pythons is a way of \u201cprotecting what I care about, the environment and my home,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Though they have lost track of exactly how many pythons they\u2019ve caught in the last few years \u2013 about 70, perhaps \u2013 this June the women became responsible for bagging <a href=\"https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/500th-burmese-python-captured-by-python-action-team-in-the-florida-everglades/67-1cf7cddc-30a5-4398-b0e8-c90b27073059\">the 500th python</a> for the Python Action Team. \u201cOur biggest so far is 12 and a half [feet],\u201d says Van Gorder. \u201cA beefy guy,\u201d adds Koehler.</p> <p>Some of the couple\u2019s customers have caught wind of what they get up to in the wilderness. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Whatever you do, just keep them from getting up here.\u2019\u201d As Koehler says this, a small papillon dog skitters across the waiting room floor. I can\u2019t help but ask if they\u2019ve ever considered the fact that a Burmese python would swallow all of their clients\u2019 pets if given half a chance. Both women laugh as Van Gorder retrieves a dog collar. It is made from the skin of a python hatchling. She crafts these herself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">divider</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21b9e6872ed9e960522e65aa447ba18d4047d44d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21b9e6872ed9e960522e65aa447ba18d4047d44d/0_0_4608_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The safest way to capture a python is by its head.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The safest way to capture a python is by its head.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Ommanney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tom Rahill meets me at a gas station on the outskirts of Miami, not far from the Everglades and Francis S Taylor wildlife management area, which is where he has agreed to take me on a \u201cpython survey\u201d. Like Koehler and Van Gorder, Rahill is a member of the Python Action Team. He\u2019s also founder of the Swamp Apes, a grassroots organization that has been approaching the python problem in a very different way \u2013 to help veterans address trauma.</p> <p>In 2008, Rahill, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, decided that his life had become depressingly conventional. \u201cMy wife had moved to Arkansas [for an academic position], my kids are grown, I\u2019m still doing IT after 30 years, and I\u2019m in suburbia,\u201d he says, letting out a pained howl. To reconnect with nature, he began volunteering for the National Park Service in the Everglades, clearing trails and capturing pythons as part of an early removal program. \u201cI\u2019d have a python on my arm at like 2 or 3 in the morning,\u201d Rahill recalls. \u201cIt was like a revelation.\u201d</p> <p>Around the same time, he was thinking about two family members in the armed services who were \u201cbanged up emotionally\u201d. And then it occurred to him that what he was doing in the Everglades might be of value to them, too: \u201cWhat a perfect group of people to get out here and experience the ruggedness of this, honor on a mission.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cmission\u201d being the trail clearing and Burmese pythons. Describing it as \u201cwilderness therapy\u201d, Rahill estimates he has taken out more than a hundred veterans over the past 10 years, and he says that the adrenaline of the hunt gives them an opportunity to work through PTSD \u2013 a claim that has <a href=\"https://www.cogentoa.com/article/10.1080/23311908.2019.1584081\">the backing</a> of psychologists at the University of South Florida. The Swamp Apes do not kill pythons because the last thing a veteran needs is further exposure to violence, Rahill says. Instead, they name many of the snakes they catch and deliver them live to an FWC facility roughly 40 miles north-east of the Everglades, where a coordinator can humanely euthanize them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b05940ac2599b5c94e1f561fa944d444beb37e7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b05940ac2599b5c94e1f561fa944d444beb37e7e/0_0_3072_4608/667.jpg\" alt=\"A python in a tree\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A python in a tree.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Ommanney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With his ponytail and unruly beard, Rahill looks like he spends a lot of time out in the marsh, and he does: at least three nights a week, often until sunrise. He spontaneously bursts into song about snakes, about his grandson, about rural decline in America.</p> <p>As dusk turns to darkness, we swing off the paved road on to a dirt levee surrounded by vast expanses of saw grass. White mayflies cover the windshield, and invisible midges (appropriately named \u201cno-see-ums\u201d) begin to bite my eyelids. Outside is an eerie quiet, the faint smell of watery rot, an orange glow from the city refracted across the wetlands. Nighthawks swoop through the headlights, but we keep our eyes fixed on the dirt, watching to see if it moves.</p> <p>After nearly three hours of driving without a single python sighting \u2013 \u201cI caught three last night!\u201d Rahill protests \u2013 he pulls up behind another truck. He hands me off to two comrades, Sgt Joe \u201cMojo\u201d Detre and Sgt Maj Tom Aycock.</p> <p>Detre rides in the flatbed with a spotlight while Aycock, born to be a drill instructor, steers along the levee. \u201cMy wife was like: \u2018This is the craziest thing,\u2019\u201d he says. But Melanie Aycock soon demanded they take her out too, and she has since become an avid python tracker herself. Both are now also members of the FWC\u2019s Python Action Team, and they usually spend Valentine\u2019s Day hunting.</p> <p>Melanie suffers from debilitating migraines, which causes depression. \u201cSo being able to get her out and into nature, and <em>exposed</em>,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s kind of the same concept as getting the veterans out here.\u201d</p> <p>After another few hours of driving, we have still seen no pythons. But Aycock and Detre are not particularly bothered; there\u2019s always tomorrow, or next week. Before we part ways, Aycock says that he has something to show me.</p> <p>We pull into a poorly lit section at the back of a casino and he and Detre lift a white box out of the truck. It looks like a beer cooler, except it\u2019s padlocked and has air holes. Inside the box is a material bag, and inside the bag is a 9ft Burmese python that Aycock captured the night before and named Fred.</p> <p>\u201cCalm down, Fred,\u201d Aycock says, as Detre grabs the agitated reptile and hoists it out.</p> <p>Liberated from the bag, the python writhes like an octopus tentacle. For a moment its tail coils around Detre\u2019s calf. \u201cSee that? It\u2019s trying to grab him,\u201d Aycock says, launching into another story about the time a python coiled around his own leg, and then his arm, and then went for his neck, until he bodyslammed it.</p> <p>Behind us, patrons trickle out into the parking lot. A woman, singing to herself, wanders past and climbs into a car, blithely unaware of what is unfolding right next to her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">divider</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"860a27d126275df3dc5acdebea79a3aa2326daf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/860a27d126275df3dc5acdebea79a3aa2326daf3/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Florida Everglades in Homestead, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Florida Everglades in Homestead, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Ommanney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are many unknowns when it comes to Burmese pythons in south Florida. The earliest recorded sighting was on the edge of Everglades national park in 1979, but nobody knows for sure how one became many. A popular (but possibly apocryphal) theory is that hundreds of them escaped from a breeding facility flattened in 1992\u2019s Hurricane Andrew. Another theory, more widely accepted, is that the blame rests largely with irresponsible pet owners.</p> <p>According to federal importation data, more than 99,000 Burmese pythons, which are native to south-east Asia, were brought into the US between 1999 and 2006 alone. Due to Florida\u2019s amenable climate, obliging private ownership laws, and lax biosecurity, some of those became pets. Four different biologists I spoke with say that owners may have set their pythons free either in or around the Everglades when their endearing 12in hatchlings grew to several feet long and became unmanageable. A list of <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306484582_2016_Krysko_et_al_New_Verified_Nonindigenous_Amphibians_and_Reptiles_in_Florida_through_2015_with_a_Summary_of_over_152_Years_of_Introductions\">reptile and amphibian imports</a> into Florida since 1863 shows that \u201cpet trade\u201d is responsible for more than 85% of introductions into the Florida environment, most of them occurring during the past six decades. Recognizing the link, the FWC made it illegal to have Burmese pythons as pets in Florida in 2010.</p> <p>Much of what is known about the python invasion is due to efforts by the Conservancy of Southwest Florida and its collaborators \u2013 what Ian Bartoszek, the conservancy\u2019s research manager, calls \u201csix years of hard work of staying on the tail of these animals\u201d.</p> <p>When I visit the conservancy, an environmental advocacy not-for-profit in Naples, I am ushered into a lab filled with snake skeletons and a giant screen showing a map of south-west Florida covered in dots, each one representing a python that is currently being tracked. A freeze-dried constrictor is coiled up in the corner, but the star attraction is 16ft and 160lb of grossly intimidating girth draped across a dissection table.</p> <p>\u201cYou should have seen us trying to pull this thing out of the freezer yesterday,\u201d says Bartoszek, who is 42 but as passionate as a teenager at his first science fair.</p> <p>In April 2015, Bartoszek and other conservancy biologists, along with land managers from Collier-Seminole state park, came across a female with an unusually distended middle. After moving the python, it started to regurgitate a white-tailed deer. The deer \u2013 a fawn \u2013 turned out to be 111% of the python\u2019s own body weight, and it would have been even more had part of it not been already digested.</p> <p>If left unchecked, the impact of such gorging will be silence. Native mammals are already being overwhelmed, either eaten or (like the Florida panther, which hunts deer) outcompeted for food. Pythons have been found to feed on at least 43 species of bird, too, including the magnificent frigatebird, which is an alarming achievement. (\u201cIt soars!\u201d Bartoszek says.) What will remain \u2013 what <em>already</em> remains, in some areas \u2013 is a landscape empty of virtually every animal except fish, rats, a few amphibians and more snakes.</p> <p>While Bartoszek talks, his colleagues slice the python\u2019s underbelly open from head to tail. Inside are 86 eggs, arranged like rows of hand grenades.</p> <p>Within a 55 sq mile chunk of Collier county, the conservancy has removed enough pythons to outweigh a small aircraft. Bartoszek and his team have also weaponized male pythons out in the field. By implanting radio transmitters and then letting them play \u201chide and seek\u201d, these males expose the location of breeding females.</p> <p>But for Bartoszek, this is only the beginning, a kind of reconnaissance period. \u201cWhat we\u2019re after is understanding,\u201d he says. \u201cHow many of them are making it to adulthood? What\u2019s the sex ratio? How old are they when they start reproducing?\u201d</p> <p>And then, of course, what\u2019s the most effective way to stop them?<br></p>",

Those who had caught the most and also the longest pythons shared in over $16,000 of prizes. \u201cWe usually achieve our goals,\u201d Koehler says, still disappointed by their efforts in the challenge. Determined, they acquired another permit (no longer required for 22 FWC-managed areas as of 2017, when the commission declared open season on pythons) and kept looking for another two months, until they came across an eight-footer. \u201cMy heart stopped,\u201d Van Gorder recalls, though now the size seems, to both of them, almost quaint. Burmese pythons have no natural predators here. They do, however, have an uncanny ability to swallow things significantly larger than their own heads. Able to grow to more than 20ft in length, these stealthy invaders ambush their prey, squeeze until the prey stops breathing and then split their jaw apart to take the prey whole. They can inflict a nasty wound on humans \u2013 when Van Gorder was bitten, it took five months for one of the broken teeth to work its way out \u2013 but the chances of anything more serious happening are slim (though not impossible). Masters of camouflage, they can slide by an eagle-eyed biologist in just a few inches of water, and they can cover huge distances. One was recently discovered coiled up on a floating crab pot more than 15 miles out to sea. It\u2019s estimated that there are tens of thousands of pythons now living in the Florida wild. A 2012 study in the Everglades suggested that a disturbing number of mammals have been swallowed by the invasive species: a spike in python sightings since 2000 coincided with a more than 90% reduction in raccoons, opossums and rabbits. But it\u2019s not just the smaller, soft animals who have been attacked. In December 2016, a YouTube video showed a Burmese python in Big Cypress national preserve, next to the Everglades, strangling an alligator. This viral video led the executive director of the South Florida water management district, who was horrified by what he saw, to create the district\u2019s own Python Elimination Program, in 2017. \u201cHe said he wanted to put 25 outdoorsmen with guns out in the field,\u201d recalls Mike Kirkland, an invasive animal biologist who was charged with assembling the original team. Damage done by the pythons to south Florida ecosystems has become so acute in recent years that the quest to stop has turned into a collective crusade. Wildlife biologists, government agencies, zoos and universities are deploying a full arsenal of responses, from telemetry tracking to early research into pheromone manipulation. In addition, the FWC and the South Florida water management district each created independent python removal squads in 2017 of hardy, civic-minded individuals who are skilled at capturing the non-native constrictors. These individuals must be over 18, and they must pass a stringent vetting process. Once licensed as professionals, they are charged with removing pythons from a patchwork quilt of district, state and federal lands that also, in the case of the Python Action Team, includes Everglades national park, which is off-limits to non-Patric hunters. The issue is also on the minds of ordinary citizens who haven\u2019t been officially tasked with stalking the species. When I mentioned the pythons in passing to a well-known Florida author, he emailed back a photo of himself holding up one he\u2019d recently shot. \u201cThem damn pythons,\u201d he wrote. Koehler and Van Gorder applied to the FWC and were accepted on the second round. They found a hatchling their first night on the job. \u201cNobody\u2019s doing this for the money,\u201d Van Gorder says, though team members are paid for their time and effort. Instead, she sees it as an act of community service. A self-described \u201carmy brat\u201d, she is not really from anywhere. But she feels like she finally has a home in Florida. Catching the pythons is a way of \u201cprotecting what I care about, the environment and my home,\u201d she says. Though they have lost track of exactly how many pythons they\u2019ve caught in the last few years \u2013 about 70, perhaps \u2013 this June the women became responsible for bagging the 500th python for the Python Action Team. \u201cOur biggest so far is 12 and a half [feet],\u201d says Van Gorder. \u201cA beefy guy,\u201d adds Koehler. Some of the couple\u2019s customers have caught wind of what they get up to in the wilderness. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Whatever you do, just keep them from getting up here.\u2019\u201d As Koehler says this, a small papillon dog skitters across the waiting room floor. I can\u2019t help but ask if they\u2019ve ever considered the fact that a Burmese python would swallow all of their clients\u2019 pets if given half a chance. Both women laugh as Van Gorder retrieves a dog collar. It is made from the skin of a python hatchling. She crafts these herself. Tom Rahill meets me at a gas station on the outskirts of Miami, not far from the Everglades and Francis S Taylor wildlife management area, which is where he has agreed to take me on a \u201cpython survey\u201d. Like Koehler and Van Gorder, Rahill is a member of the Python Action Team. He\u2019s also founder of the Swamp Apes, a grassroots organization that has been approaching the python problem in a very different way \u2013 to help veterans address trauma. In 2008, Rahill, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, decided that his life had become depressingly conventional. \u201cMy wife had moved to Arkansas [for an academic position], my kids are grown, I\u2019m still doing IT after 30 years, and I\u2019m in suburbia,\u201d he says, letting out a pained howl. To reconnect with nature, he began volunteering for the National Park Service in the Everglades, clearing trails and capturing pythons as part of an early removal program. \u201cI\u2019d have a python on my arm at like 2 or 3 in the morning,\u201d Rahill recalls. \u201cIt was like a revelation.\u201d Around the same time, he was thinking about two family members in the armed services who were \u201cbanged up emotionally\u201d. And then it occurred to him that what he was doing in the Everglades might be of value to them, too: \u201cWhat a perfect group of people to get out here and experience the ruggedness of this, honor on a mission.\u201d The \u201cmission\u201d being the trail clearing and Burmese pythons. Describing it as \u201cwilderness therapy\u201d, Rahill estimates he has taken out more than a hundred veterans over the past 10 years, and he says that the adrenaline of the hunt gives them an opportunity to work through PTSD \u2013 a claim that has the backing of psychologists at the University of South Florida. The Swamp Apes do not kill pythons because the last thing a veteran needs is further exposure to violence, Rahill says. Instead, they name many of the snakes they catch and deliver them live to an FWC facility roughly 40 miles north-east of the Everglades, where a coordinator can humanely euthanize them. With his ponytail and unruly beard, Rahill looks like he spends a lot of time out in the marsh, and he does: at least three nights a week, often until sunrise. He spontaneously bursts into song about snakes, about his grandson, about rural decline in America. As dusk turns to darkness, we swing off the paved road on to a dirt levee surrounded by vast expanses of saw grass. White mayflies cover the windshield, and invisible midges (appropriately named \u201cno-see-ums\u201d) begin to bite my eyelids. Outside is an eerie quiet, the faint smell of watery rot, an orange glow from the city refracted across the wetlands. Nighthawks swoop through the headlights, but we keep our eyes fixed on the dirt, watching to see if it moves. After nearly three hours of driving without a single python sighting \u2013 \u201cI caught three last night!\u201d Rahill protests \u2013 he pulls up behind another truck. He hands me off to two comrades, Sgt Joe \u201cMojo\u201d Detre and Sgt Maj Tom Aycock. Detre rides in the flatbed with a spotlight while Aycock, born to be a drill instructor, steers along the levee. \u201cMy wife was like: \u2018This is the craziest thing,\u2019\u201d he says. But Melanie Aycock soon demanded they take her out too, and she has since become an avid python tracker herself. Both are now also members of the FWC\u2019s Python Action Team, and they usually spend Valentine\u2019s Day hunting. Melanie suffers from debilitating migraines, which causes depression. \u201cSo being able to get her out and into nature, and exposed,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s kind of the same concept as getting the veterans out here.\u201d After another few hours of driving, we have still seen no pythons. But Aycock and Detre are not particularly bothered; there\u2019s always tomorrow, or next week. Before we part ways, Aycock says that he has something to show me. We pull into a poorly lit section at the back of a casino and he and Detre lift a white box out of the truck. It looks like a beer cooler, except it\u2019s padlocked and has air holes. Inside the box is a material bag, and inside the bag is a 9ft Burmese python that Aycock captured the night before and named Fred. \u201cCalm down, Fred,\u201d Aycock says, as Detre grabs the agitated reptile and hoists it out. Liberated from the bag, the python writhes like an octopus tentacle. For a moment its tail coils around Detre\u2019s calf. \u201cSee that? It\u2019s trying to grab him,\u201d Aycock says, launching into another story about the time a python coiled around his own leg, and then his arm, and then went for his neck, until he bodyslammed it. Behind us, patrons trickle out into the parking lot. A woman, singing to herself, wanders past and climbs into a car, blithely unaware of what is unfolding right next to her. There are many unknowns when it comes to Burmese pythons in south Florida. The earliest recorded sighting was on the edge of Everglades national park in 1979, but nobody knows for sure how one became many. A popular (but possibly apocryphal) theory is that hundreds of them escaped from a breeding facility flattened in 1992\u2019s Hurricane Andrew. Another theory, more widely accepted, is that the blame rests largely with irresponsible pet owners. According to federal importation data, more than 99,000 Burmese pythons, which are native to south-east Asia, were brought into the US between 1999 and 2006 alone. Due to Florida\u2019s amenable climate, obliging private ownership laws, and lax biosecurity, some of those became pets. Four different biologists I spoke with say that owners may have set their pythons free either in or around the Everglades when their endearing 12in hatchlings grew to several feet long and became unmanageable. A list of reptile and amphibian imports into Florida since 1863 shows that \u201cpet trade\u201d is responsible for more than 85% of introductions into the Florida environment, most of them occurring during the past six decades. Recognizing the link, the FWC made it illegal to have Burmese pythons as pets in Florida in 2010. Much of what is known about the python invasion is due to efforts by the Conservancy of Southwest Florida and its collaborators \u2013 what Ian Bartoszek, the conservancy\u2019s research manager, calls \u201csix years of hard work of staying on the tail of these animals\u201d. When I visit the conservancy, an environmental advocacy not-for-profit in Naples, I am ushered into a lab filled with snake skeletons and a giant screen showing a map of south-west Florida covered in dots, each one representing a python that is currently being tracked. A freeze-dried constrictor is coiled up in the corner, but the star attraction is 16ft and 160lb of grossly intimidating girth draped across a dissection table. \u201cYou should have seen us trying to pull this thing out of the freezer yesterday,\u201d says Bartoszek, who is 42 but as passionate as a teenager at his first science fair. In April 2015, Bartoszek and other conservancy biologists, along with land managers from Collier-Seminole state park, came across a female with an unusually distended middle. After moving the python, it started to regurgitate a white-tailed deer. The deer \u2013 a fawn \u2013 turned out to be 111% of the python\u2019s own body weight, and it would have been even more had part of it not been already digested. If left unchecked, the impact of such gorging will be silence. Native mammals are already being overwhelmed, either eaten or (like the Florida panther, which hunts deer) outcompeted for food. Pythons have been found to feed on at least 43 species of bird, too, including the magnificent frigatebird, which is an alarming achievement. (\u201cIt soars!\u201d Bartoszek says.) What will remain \u2013 what already remains, in some areas \u2013 is a landscape empty of virtually every animal except fish, rats, a few amphibians and more snakes. While Bartoszek talks, his colleagues slice the python\u2019s underbelly open from head to tail. Inside are 86 eggs, arranged like rows of hand grenades. Within a 55 sq mile chunk of Collier county, the conservancy has removed enough pythons to outweigh a small aircraft. Bartoszek and his team have also weaponized male pythons out in the field. By implanting radio transmitters and then letting them play \u201chide and seek\u201d, these males expose the location of breeding females. But for Bartoszek, this is only the beginning, a kind of reconnaissance period. \u201cWhat we\u2019re after is understanding,\u201d he says. \u201cHow many of them are making it to adulthood? What\u2019s the sex ratio? How old are they when they start reproducing?\u201d And then, of course, what\u2019s the most effective way to stop them?",

      "body": "<p>Tesco has pledged to step up its efforts in the battle against single-use plastic with measures that include banning brands using excessive packaging from Britain\u2019s largest supermarket chain.</p> \n<p>Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, said the company would \u201creserve the right not to list\u201d products with too much non-recyclable packaging from next year onwards, in an article published on theguardian.com.</p> \n<p>Tesco gave suppliers a list of preferred materials in May 2018, but is now planning to turn up the pressure as public awareness of the environmental harm caused by plastic packaging grows.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t overlook the fact that for too long, packaging on consumer goods has been excessive,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cWe have all looked at the settled contents of a cereal packet and puzzled over the comparative size of the bag and box. Or opened a bag of crisps and wondered why the packaging is twice the size of the contents.\u201d</p> \n<p>In its latest annual report Tesco said 13% of packaging on its own-brand products was hard to recycle, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/02/use-compostable-plastic-and-the-16-other-essential-rules-of-effective-recycling\">black plastic used in microwaveable meals</a>; this will be eliminated by the end of this year, Lewis said. He added that Tesco was working with branded suppliers to do the same.</p> \n<p>Tesco has itself been the subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2018/mar/12/pack-it-in-which-food-company-has-the-most-cynical-packaging\">criticism over its packaging in the past</a>, but any improvements could have major implications for Britons\u2019 plastic waste. Lewis said scrapping the plastic used to package tins in multipacks alone would save 490 tonnes of plastic a year, and it could prevent the sale of more than 50m plastic beer can binders.</p> \n<p>The supermarket is trialling measures to reduce waste at its Extra store near Cambridge. Lewis, who took over the supermarket in 2014 and has since initiated severe cost-cutting, pledged to roll out the most effective measures across the retailer\u2019s 2,658 British stores.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"96154293-cd66-4390-a4b1-6e185e13b555\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Rinse your bottles and tins</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Really mucky packaging will be considered too contaminated and be rejected.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Recycling envelopes with plastic windows is fine</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The same goes for sticky tape on wrapping paper \u2013 although the more of this you can remove, the better.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>A cotton bag for life needs to be used 131 times to be worth it</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Whatever type of bag you choose, the key to reducing its environmental impact is to reuse it as many times as possible.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Get your milk delivered in glass bottles</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Even though reusable glass bottles are heavy and require higher temperatures during the initial production process \u2013 thereby consuming more energy \u2013 they are generally the better option, particularly if the milkman delivers from nearby farms.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Buy recycled plastic products when you can</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Even if you recycle newly created or 'virgin' plastic, you are still fuelling the demand for it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Use a tin for your sandwiches</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The 'reduce and reuse' mantra applies: investing in a sandwich tin or reusable wrappers is a better option \u2013 if you really will use them again and again.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Stick with reusable coffee cups for now</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Processes are being developed to recycle disposable coffee cups, most local authorities won\u2019t currently collect them.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Plastic supermarket packaging reduces some food waste...</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>...but it still does more harm than good overall</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Use compostable plastic \u2013 even though it isn\u2019t perfect</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many fast-food outlets are switching to compostable plastics, such as Vegware, to boost their eco-credentials.

New rules, currently under consultation, could force private companies, including supermarkets, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/18/packaging-producers-to-pay-full-recycling-costs-under-waste-scheme\">pay as much as \u00a31bn a year more</a> towards the UK\u2019s recycling infrastructure \u2013 up from about \u00a370m now.</p> \n<p>Lewis called for the government to take a national approach to recycling in order to standardise processes. Households currently face confusing variation in the quality of recycling services, which can result in products being sent to landfill that would be recycled under a different local authority in houses in the next street. National recycling rates have plateaued at about 45% since 2013, according to government figures.</p> \n<p>Lewis wrote: \u201cToday, recycling rates vary across local authorities from 65% to 14%. Without a national infrastructure, industry efforts to improve the recyclability of materials used in packaging will not have the impact we need.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>\u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a> or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>.</strong></p>",

Tesco gave suppliers a list of preferred materials in May 2018, but is now planning to turn up the pressure as public awareness of the environmental harm caused by plastic packaging grows. \u201cWe can\u2019t overlook the fact that for too long, packaging on consumer goods has been excessive,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cWe have all looked at the settled contents of a cereal packet and puzzled over the comparative size of the bag and box. Or opened a bag of crisps and wondered why the packaging is twice the size of the contents.\u201d In its latest annual report Tesco said 13% of packaging on its own-brand products was hard to recycle, such as the black plastic used in microwaveable meals; this will be eliminated by the end of this year, Lewis said. He added that Tesco was working with branded suppliers to do the same. Tesco has itself been the subject of criticism over its packaging in the past, but any improvements could have major implications for Britons\u2019 plastic waste. Lewis said scrapping the plastic used to package tins in multipacks alone would save 490 tonnes of plastic a year, and it could prevent the sale of more than 50m plastic beer can binders. The supermarket is trialling measures to reduce waste at its Extra store near Cambridge. Lewis, who took over the supermarket in 2014 and has since initiated severe cost-cutting, pledged to roll out the most effective measures across the retailer\u2019s 2,658 British stores. Tesco\u2019s move comes amid a growing public backlash against plastic packaging that has spurred the government to implement a single-use plastic bag levy and consider policies such as mandatory deposit return schemes for bottles. Other major supermarkets have trialled processes that could reduce packaging. Morrisons and Waitrose have both tested refill stations to allow customers to buy packaging-free goods, including pasta, wine and cleaning materials. Iceland last year pledged to eliminate all plastics in its own-brand products within five years. Tesco is also trialling the Loop scheme, which aims to dramatically increase packaging reuse. Loop, run by recycling firm Terracycle, has signed up other large partners, including consumer goods firms Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Coca-Cola and Mondel\u0113z. Supermarkets and food companies in the UK have been spurred into action by government plans to introduce the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle in its approach to waste. New rules, currently under consultation, could force private companies, including supermarkets, to pay as much as \u00a31bn a year more towards the UK\u2019s recycling infrastructure \u2013 up from about \u00a370m now. Lewis called for the government to take a national approach to recycling in order to standardise processes. Households currently face confusing variation in the quality of recycling services, which can result in products being sent to landfill that would be recycled under a different local authority in houses in the next street. National recycling rates have plateaued at about 45% since 2013, according to government figures. Lewis wrote: \u201cToday, recycling rates vary across local authorities from 65% to 14%. Without a national infrastructure, industry efforts to improve the recyclability of materials used in packaging will not have the impact we need.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

Everybody knew this. And he weighed about 22 stone [140kg] at this time. The railings were wire. So I think he lost his balance, because he was very top-heavy,\u201d Lennox says. \u201cHe was Teflon man. I don\u2019t think he committed suicide.\u201d</p> <p>Bombastic, bullying and with a deep, booming voice, Maxwell was an enormous figure in British national life. Apart from Mirror Group Newspapers and the New York Daily News, his many businesses included Oxford United and Derby County football clubs. He rose from impoverishment as a Czechoslovakian refugee to become a decorated war hero, a businessman, a Labour MP and then a media mogul, amassing private jets, helicopters and Rolls-Royces en route.</p> <p>His death on 5 November 1991 shocked the country. Shock turned to anger within weeks when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/09/robert-maxwells-sons-say-tycoon-was-to-meet-boe-the-day-he-died\" title=\"\">a \u00a3460m hole was discovered in the pension funds of his companies</a>. A borrower of unimaginable scale, he had illegally raided the funds to prop up his empire, which was on the brink of collapse. Headlines such as The Man Who Saved the Mirror were swiftly replaced by Maxwell: The Robber.</p> <p>Lennox found himself at the heart of this drama when he was dispatched to help Maxwell\u2019s widow, Betty, as she flew by private jet to the Canary Islands. On take-off, her husband was still missing. Mid-flight, Lennox recalls, he was summoned to the cockpit by the co-pilot. A body had been found in the Atlantic by a fisherman. The Spanish were unsure it was Maxwell. Would Lennox agree to look first to spare his widow unnecessary distress in case it was not her husband?</p> <p>They landed at an airbase and Lennox was ushered into a room. \u201cAnd there was Maxwell. Completely naked, lying on top of the air-sea rescue officers\u2019 mess table with a sheet underneath him. And, I know it sounds crazy, but he looked good. His hair still slicked back, his complexion; he looked as if he was still alive.\u201d Apart from a graze to his left shoulder, Maxwell\u2019s body was unmarked, Lennox says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b381d4a5147fad31b104ad433cc5a1731b706737\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b381d4a5147fad31b104ad433cc5a1731b706737/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Mirror announces Maxwell\u2019s death in 1991\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The rumours started immediately\u2019 ... the Daily Mirror announces Maxwell\u2019s death in 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Stephens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He signed an affidavit that it was, indeed, the publisher. \u201cThen they asked me to come over and stand by Maxwell. There he was, laid out horizontally in front of me. I held up the affidavit and they took a photograph of me, with Robert underneath. So, somewhere in the Spanish archives, there is a photograph of me with Maxwell\u2019s corpse.\u201d</p> <p>The rumours started immediately. An inquest that later recorded death by heart attack and accidental drowning (<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-mystery-of-maxwells-death-6107041.html\" title=\"\">although three pathologists disagreed on the exact cause of death</a>) has failed to quell them.</p> <p>\u201cPeople were phoning me up with all the conspiracy theories. \u2018Do you think Maxwell was knocked off? Did you see any puncture marks behind his ears?\u2019 But he was unmarked, apart from that graze on his shoulder,\u201d says Lennox.</p> <p>Betty, completely controlled, would later formally identify her husband. Shortly afterwards, Ghislaine flew in. \u201cShe was really, really upset. You could tell, this was \u2018Daddy\u2019s girl\u2019. She was inconsolable; she could hardly speak. When she saw her mother, her knees just buckled,\u201d Lennox recalls. \u201cShe was really devastated.

      "bodyText": "At one time, everyone knew where to find Ghislaine Maxwell. The former aide-de-camp of the disgraced, now deceased, billionaire Jeffrey Epstein was a fixture in Manhattan\u2019s most fashionable salons. With an impressive list of contacts, including Prince Andrew and Chelsea Clinton, she was a regular at fundraisers, book launches and society weddings. The last place anyone would have expected to see her was a Los Angeles shopping mall, where the 57-year-old was photographed in a burger joint last week, just days after Epstein\u2019s suicide in a New York jail, where he was being held on charges of sex trafficking underage girls. Amid some speculation as to whether the photograph may have been staged, and with mystery still surrounding her whereabouts, one thing is undeniable: for the second time, Ghislaine\u2019s life has been turned upside down by the death of a controversial and powerful man. It is almost 30 years since her father, the press baron Robert Maxwell, fell to his death from his \u00a315m yacht, Lady Ghislaine, off the Canary Islands, aged 68. Even now there is talk of suicide, or murder \u2013 perhaps by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service. \u201cHe was a man who could not face the ignominy of jail, of being shown to be a liar and a thief. And he very much knew that was coming,\u201d says Roy Greenslade, a former editor of one of Maxwell\u2019s newspapers, the Daily Mirror. \u201cSo I am a suicide theorist. I believe Maxwell threw himself off.\u201d But Ken Lennox, then the Mirror\u2019s senior photographer, who saw the publisher\u2019s naked corpse shortly after it was pulled from the sea, is convinced: it was an accident. \u201cHe used to get up at night and pee over the stern of the ship. Everybody knew this. And he weighed about 22 stone [140kg] at this time. The railings were wire. So I think he lost his balance, because he was very top-heavy,\u201d Lennox says. \u201cHe was Teflon man. I don\u2019t think he committed suicide.\u201d Bombastic, bullying and with a deep, booming voice, Maxwell was an enormous figure in British national life. Apart from Mirror Group Newspapers and the New York Daily News, his many businesses included Oxford United and Derby County football clubs. He rose from impoverishment as a Czechoslovakian refugee to become a decorated war hero, a businessman, a Labour MP and then a media mogul, amassing private jets, helicopters and Rolls-Royces en route. His death on 5 November 1991 shocked the country. Shock turned to anger within weeks when a \u00a3460m hole was discovered in the pension funds of his companies. A borrower of unimaginable scale, he had illegally raided the funds to prop up his empire, which was on the brink of collapse. Headlines such as The Man Who Saved the Mirror were swiftly replaced by Maxwell: The Robber. Lennox found himself at the heart of this drama when he was dispatched to help Maxwell\u2019s widow, Betty, as she flew by private jet to the Canary Islands. On take-off, her husband was still missing. Mid-flight, Lennox recalls, he was summoned to the cockpit by the co-pilot. A body had been found in the Atlantic by a fisherman. The Spanish were unsure it was Maxwell. Would Lennox agree to look first to spare his widow unnecessary distress in case it was not her husband? They landed at an airbase and Lennox was ushered into a room. \u201cAnd there was Maxwell. Completely naked, lying on top of the air-sea rescue officers\u2019 mess table with a sheet underneath him. And, I know it sounds crazy, but he looked good. His hair still slicked back, his complexion; he looked as if he was still alive.\u201d Apart from a graze to his left shoulder, Maxwell\u2019s body was unmarked, Lennox says. He signed an affidavit that it was, indeed, the publisher. \u201cThen they asked me to come over and stand by Maxwell. There he was, laid out horizontally in front of me. I held up the affidavit and they took a photograph of me, with Robert underneath. So, somewhere in the Spanish archives, there is a photograph of me with Maxwell\u2019s corpse.\u201d The rumours started immediately. An inquest that later recorded death by heart attack and accidental drowning (although three pathologists disagreed on the exact cause of death) has failed to quell them. \u201cPeople were phoning me up with all the conspiracy theories. \u2018Do you think Maxwell was knocked off? Did you see any puncture marks behind his ears?\u2019 But he was unmarked, apart from that graze on his shoulder,\u201d says Lennox. Betty, completely controlled, would later formally identify her husband. Shortly afterwards, Ghislaine flew in. \u201cShe was really, really upset. You could tell, this was \u2018Daddy\u2019s girl\u2019. She was inconsolable; she could hardly speak. When she saw her mother, her knees just buckled,\u201d Lennox recalls. \u201cShe was really devastated. If you look through the Maxwell files, he would take her to events: Elton John\u2019s birthday, football matches. She was always there, clinging on to him. She called him \u201cMy Daddy\u201d all the time.\u201d The fallout from Maxwell\u2019s death left his family\u2019s reputation in tatters. It also landed two of his sons, Ian and Kevin, in the dock, where they successfully defended themselves in 1996 against fraud charges arising from their roles in his companies. Kevin became Britain\u2019s biggest bankrupt, to the tune of more than \u00a3400m, in the wake of the pensions scandal. His then wife, Pandora, mother to their seven children, claimed a colourful cameo on the day of Kevin\u2019s arrest. On hearing an early-morning knock at the door and presuming it to be journalists, she flung open a bedroom window and yelled: \u201cPiss off or I\u2019ll call the police.\u201d \u201cWe are the police,\u201d came the reply. \u201cThat was priceless,\u201d says Lennox, who was among the journalists tipped off to witness the arrest. \u201cThe trial of Robert Maxwell \u2013 or the trials of Robert Maxwell, had he come back and faced the music \u2013 would have been a piece of amazing theatre. Way up there with Bernie Madoff,\u201d says Greenslade, the author of Maxwell: The Rise and Fall of Robert Maxwell and His Empire. Ian and Kevin, like all the Maxwell children, were regularly bullied by a father who thought nothing of humiliating them in public (although Ghislaine, apparently, didn\u2019t get it quite as bad). \u201cI felt this was a proxy trial for Maxwell,\u201d says Greenslade, who attended every day of the brothers\u2019 eight-month trial and was pleased when they were acquitted. For Oxford-educated Ghislaine, the youngest of his nine children, Maxwell\u2019s money had provided status and a ticket to the elite. She was dispatched to New York initially as a meeter-and-greeter, to pave her father\u2019s way when he bought the Daily News. After his death, she made it her home. She soon became part of Epstein\u2019s inner circle and remained there for more than a decade. The two were reportedly briefly an item; they remained close.

One acquaintance described her as \u201chalf ex-girlfriend, half employee, half best friend and fixer\u201d. Epstein described her, in a 2003 Vanity Fair profile, as his \u201cbest friend\u201d. After he pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution and served 13 months, it appears she moved on, although she remained on New York\u2019s social circuit. She founded the non-profit TerraMar Project for the conservation of oceans in 2012, but it shut down abruptly last month. It is not clear how she supports herself. She has never been accused of wrongdoing by the authorities. Allegations by Epstein\u2019s accusers that she helped procure girls for the financier have been denied repeatedly. Maxwell, one of seven children of Jewish parents, was born J\u00e1n Ludv\u00edk Hoch in the Czechoslovakian mountain village of Slatinsk\u00e9 Doly, now part of Ukraine and known as Solotvyno.

      "bodyText": "A full bench of the federal court has ordered an asylum case rejected by the controversial circuit court judge Sandy Street to be reheard, adding further criticisms of his conduct and finding he failed to give procedural fairness to the Iranian asylum seeker. The judgment by the chief justice, James Allsop, and justices Melissa Perry and Jacqueline Gleeson said the man had no legal representation and no translator with him when he appeared via video link at his July 2018 hearing. It also noted Street had instructed the interpreter not to translate his reasons, which he delivered verbally, and that he then did not publish them until 54 days after the man\u2019s window to appeal closed. In March Justice Nye Perram rejected an application to have Street\u2019s ruling put under judicial review, but was nonetheless critical of Street\u2019s conduct. On Wednesday the full bench sent the case back to the federal circuit court to be heard by a different judge, after it was asked by both parties to make orders by consent, under circumstances the judges said were \u201cunusual and warrant an explanation\u201d. The judgment noted the federal government\u2019s senior counsel had agreed that Street had failed to hear the case with procedural fairness. It outlined that in Street\u2019s hearing: The Iranian man had no legal representation. He appeared via video link from Western Australia while a translator was in a Sydney courtroom. He raised concerns of unfairness at the time. There was \u201creal doubt\u201d whether the man had been given the minister\u2019s submissions, but Street said it was sufficient to just have them explained, and did not try to clarify what happened. The man sought an adjournment to correct errors in his translated affidavit, but Street refused and admitted it unchanged into evidence. Street delivered an ex tempore (verbal) judgment, and instructed the interpreter not to translate. Street made no apparent effort to have his reasons written until they were requested. The reasons were not published until 75 days after he delivered them, and 54 days after the expiry of the time within which an appeal could be lodged. In the four years since Street was appointed by the then attorney general, George Brandis, more than 80 of his cases have been overturned. On Thursday the Australian reported that number included at least 10 cases in which he denied procedural fairness. Street has also previously been found to have failed to properly try cases and give proper reasons. The president of the Law Council of Australia, Arthur Moses SC, would not comment on the judge, but told Guardian Australia on Thursday that ensuring procedural fairness to someone party to court proceedings was \u201can essential element of the administration of justice in this country\u201d. \u201cThe Law Council has been concerned for some time that the conduct of some judicial officers of the federal circuit court detracts from the hard work undertaken by the majority of the judges of the \u2026 court,\u201d Moses said. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of judges of the federal circuit court work tirelessly to administer justice, despite a crushing workload in an under-resourced court.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Law Council has previously said it was considering a series of judgments by Street. Complaints about judges are dealt with through the federal court and the chief justice but all aspects of a complaint, including the subject, documentation and any referral to the attorney general, are confidential. The process is exempt from freedom of information laws. \u201cFor constitutional reasons, the participation of a judge in responding to a complaint is entirely voluntary,\u201d the court\u2019s website says. \u201cNevertheless, it is accepted that a procedure for complaints can provide valuable feedback to the court and to its judges.\u201d It says the complaints procedure cannot provide a mechanism for disciplining a judge. \u201cIt does, however, offer a process by which complaints by a member of the public about judicial conduct can be brought to the attention of the chief justice and the judge concerned, and it provides an opportunity for a complaint to be dealt with in an appropriate manner.\u201d",

While there are arguments on both sides as to who is at fault, the standoff raises an interesting question: if the two companies part ways, can Sony\u2019s Universe of Marvel Characters (SUMC) survive without any involvement from Kevin Feige?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/21/spider-man-out-of-marvel-cinematic-universe-after-disney-split-with-sony\">Spider-Man out of Marvel Cinematic Universe after Disney split with Sony</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Disney, Marvel Studios and Sony first brokered the deal back in February 2015. <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-sony-marvel-spider-man-20170626-story.html\">As the LA Times reports</a>, Sony was disappointed by its latest Spider-Man outing (Andrew Garfield\u2019s The Amazing Spider-Man 2), so executives Michael Lynton and Amy Pascal reached out to Marvel to strike a five-movie deal. Feige would oversee creative direction and be able to use Spidey in the MCU, and Marvel would get a tiny portion of first-dollar gross on any solo Spider-Man films. Sony, meanwhile, would completely finance the films and be in charge of casting. Marvel characters like Iron Man would show up to boost the star power of the SUMC, but Sony would not reap any profits from Spidey\u2019s appearances in any MCU films. It was a delicate compromise, but for the most part, it worked.</p> <p>The trouble came when the five-movie contract ended. During negotiations, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/08/kevin-feige-spider-man-franchise-exit-disney-sony-dispute-avengers-endgame-captain-america-winter-soldier-tom-rothman-bob-iger-1202672545/\">Deadline reported that</a> Disney asked to change the deal so that it co-finances all future Spider-Man films 50/50 and receives more profits than the current 5%; Disney also reportedly asked that this be extended to all the other films in the SUMC, like the upcoming Venom 2 and Morbius.</p> <p>Reports conflict on whether Sony immediately walked or tried to negotiate Disney down. (Notably, the two execs who originally brokered the deal, Lynton and Pascal, are no longer with Sony.) Regardless, the deed was done, and <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/spider-man-sony-disney-marvel-responds-1203308802/\">in a statement Sony simply said</a> that it \u201crespects Disney\u2019s decision not to have [Feige] continue as a lead producer of our next live action Spider-Man film. We hope this might change in the future.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"296060857c5aaf09d07a3f0b80054654d787e4d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/296060857c5aaf09d07a3f0b80054654d787e4d1/0_0_3540_2427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Feige at the world premiere of Spider-Man: Far From Home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Feige at the world premiere of Spider-Man: Far From Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many fans have interpreted this split as the death knell for Spider-Man, as they view Feige as being Spider-Man\u2019s saving grace. Does this idea hold water though? The charismatic and acrobatic Tom Holland is credited with revitalizing the role, but it was really Sony\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-sony-marvel-spider-man-20170626-story.html\">Pascal who cast Holland</a>, along with the Homecoming and Far From Home director Jon Watts. <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/sony-spider-man-future-amy-pascal-phil-lord-interview\">Vanity Fair reports</a> that Pascal was friends with Feige, and she was just as passionate about the webslinger\u2019s potential as Feige was.</p> <p>Since Pascal became a producer in 2015, it was the joint work of the two that created the Spider-Man universe as we know it today. According to Vanity Fair, Pascal gave Chris Miller and Phil Lord pretty much free rein to make Into the Spider-Verse; she also championed animated spin-offs for Spider-Gwen and Spider-Woman, as well as a live-action Silk movie (starring the Korean-American webslinger Cindy Moon).</p> <p>Unfortunately, just this May <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amy-pascal-exits-sony-universal-deal-1206536\">Pascal exited Sony</a> for Universal, which means, well, we\u2019re back to the question of whether the SUMC can keep sailing. (With Pascal gone, there\u2019s also the question of whether her passion projects, which were aimed at putting more women in the Spider-Verse front and center, are now dead in the water.)</p> <p>If we just look at finances, Spider-Man and the wider SUMC will probably survive even without Feige or Pascal. Thanks to Spider-Man being a pop culture icon, his films were never box office bombs (various <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/20/fans-threaten-to-boycott-sony-ps4-over-spider-man-leaving-mcu\">Sony boycotting efforts notwithstanding</a>). Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man made $821m worldwide when it first debuted, and though critically panned, Spider-Man 3 still managed $890m. (Spider-Man: Homecoming, in comparison, coughed up $880m.) The Amazing Spider-Man films are what everyone points to when discussing how Sony failed the webslinger, but the first film made $757m and Garfield\u2019s disaffected Peter <a href=\"http://collider.com/the-amazing-spider-man-movies-explained/\">still has his fans</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"95426fd8efa941c6afe714a3287292d564a32d0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95426fd8efa941c6afe714a3287292d564a32d0e/0_0_4970_2431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hardy as Venom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"489\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hardy as Venom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Marvel Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not so much a question of whether Marvel-separate Sony films will be profitable, but if they\u2019ll be movies fans even want to see. The Venom film already answers this, in part: Venom is completely separate from the MCU and never even featured a Spidey cameo, and yet his film raked in $856m. You may hate the idea of a Marvel-less Spider-Man universe, but many others don\u2019t. Now with Spidey free to swing back to his own world, it\u2019s assumed he may cross over into forthcoming films like Venom 2 and Morbius in some form.</p> <p>The main worry, of course, is that without both Feige and Pascal, the quality of the films will dip.

      "bodyText": "Is the Marvel Cinematic Universe going to have to say goodbye to its friendly neighborhood Spider-Man? Marvel and Sony discussions on how to share the webslinger\u2019s universe have reached an impasse, meaning Spider-Man is barred from rejoining the Avengers. While there are arguments on both sides as to who is at fault, the standoff raises an interesting question: if the two companies part ways, can Sony\u2019s Universe of Marvel Characters (SUMC) survive without any involvement from Kevin Feige? Disney, Marvel Studios and Sony first brokered the deal back in February 2015. As the LA Times reports, Sony was disappointed by its latest Spider-Man outing (Andrew Garfield\u2019s The Amazing Spider-Man 2), so executives Michael Lynton and Amy Pascal reached out to Marvel to strike a five-movie deal. Feige would oversee creative direction and be able to use Spidey in the MCU, and Marvel would get a tiny portion of first-dollar gross on any solo Spider-Man films. Sony, meanwhile, would completely finance the films and be in charge of casting. Marvel characters like Iron Man would show up to boost the star power of the SUMC, but Sony would not reap any profits from Spidey\u2019s appearances in any MCU films. It was a delicate compromise, but for the most part, it worked. The trouble came when the five-movie contract ended. During negotiations, Deadline reported that Disney asked to change the deal so that it co-finances all future Spider-Man films 50/50 and receives more profits than the current 5%; Disney also reportedly asked that this be extended to all the other films in the SUMC, like the upcoming Venom 2 and Morbius. Reports conflict on whether Sony immediately walked or tried to negotiate Disney down. (Notably, the two execs who originally brokered the deal, Lynton and Pascal, are no longer with Sony.) Regardless, the deed was done, and in a statement Sony simply said that it \u201crespects Disney\u2019s decision not to have [Feige] continue as a lead producer of our next live action Spider-Man film. We hope this might change in the future.\u201d Many fans have interpreted this split as the death knell for Spider-Man, as they view Feige as being Spider-Man\u2019s saving grace. Does this idea hold water though? The charismatic and acrobatic Tom Holland is credited with revitalizing the role, but it was really Sony\u2019s Pascal who cast Holland, along with the Homecoming and Far From Home director Jon Watts. Vanity Fair reports that Pascal was friends with Feige, and she was just as passionate about the webslinger\u2019s potential as Feige was. Since Pascal became a producer in 2015, it was the joint work of the two that created the Spider-Man universe as we know it today. According to Vanity Fair, Pascal gave Chris Miller and Phil Lord pretty much free rein to make Into the Spider-Verse; she also championed animated spin-offs for Spider-Gwen and Spider-Woman, as well as a live-action Silk movie (starring the Korean-American webslinger Cindy Moon). Unfortunately, just this May Pascal exited Sony for Universal, which means, well, we\u2019re back to the question of whether the SUMC can keep sailing. (With Pascal gone, there\u2019s also the question of whether her passion projects, which were aimed at putting more women in the Spider-Verse front and center, are now dead in the water.) If we just look at finances, Spider-Man and the wider SUMC will probably survive even without Feige or Pascal. Thanks to Spider-Man being a pop culture icon, his films were never box office bombs (various Sony boycotting efforts notwithstanding). Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man made $821m worldwide when it first debuted, and though critically panned, Spider-Man 3 still managed $890m. (Spider-Man: Homecoming, in comparison, coughed up $880m.) The Amazing Spider-Man films are what everyone points to when discussing how Sony failed the webslinger, but the first film made $757m and Garfield\u2019s disaffected Peter still has his fans. It\u2019s not so much a question of whether Marvel-separate Sony films will be profitable, but if they\u2019ll be movies fans even want to see. The Venom film already answers this, in part: Venom is completely separate from the MCU and never even featured a Spidey cameo, and yet his film raked in $856m. You may hate the idea of a Marvel-less Spider-Man universe, but many others don\u2019t. Now with Spidey free to swing back to his own world, it\u2019s assumed he may cross over into forthcoming films like Venom 2 and Morbius in some form. The main worry, of course, is that without both Feige and Pascal, the quality of the films will dip. This is a possibility. But as with any change, there\u2019s also opportunity. If Sony forges ahead with the Silk film sooner rather than later, or potentially debuts a live-action Miles Morales, they may very well guarantee their success for years to come. Some even suggest that, with the hope of an MCU crossover gone, Sony may now feel more free to produce artsy and tonally different films, like an R-rated Venom 2, in the same way Fox once made the brutal and heartbreaking Logan. Depending on your perspective, this split is terrible, or it\u2019s fine. Holland is contracted for two more solo Spider-Man films under Sony, so fans can rest assured that Peter and his motley crew will still be around for at least a few more years. It may sting that Peter may never mention Happy or Tony again, but just think: without Peter\u2019s stories wholly revolving around Tony, there\u2019s space for Peter to deal with his own issues, rather than constantly grapple with his mentor\u2019s role in the military industrial complex.

Part history, part field guide and part folktale, the more you read the more you realise that this bewitching creature is an allegory for Australia itself.</p> <p>The long-haired rat does not carry disease. It does not smell. It is mostly hidden underground, coming above in huge masses after rain. While European rats are \u201ccommensal\u201d (reliant on human populations for food and shelter), the Australian rat is not. It moves through this country\u2019s history as a proud, independent figure, fluffy and odd-looking and, according to Bonyhady, somewhat magical.</p> <p>Bonyhady is a professor in environmental law at the Australian National University and the author of previous books on cultural and art history. The rat is an \u201centry point\u201d into other worlds, he tells Guardian Australia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4fae915b7daa72d5b9e226ec2b28d41b36f0572c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fae915b7daa72d5b9e226ec2b28d41b36f0572c/0_0_630_1141/552.jpg\" alt=\"The long-haired rat.\" width=\"552\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The long-haired rat has a special hunger for European food and equipment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angus Emmott/Text Publishing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere was something exciting about taking this creature that people hadn\u2019t heard of and having it as my kind of my main thread. I hit on the idea that I could call it a rodent history. We have economic history and environmental history and social history and all those different types. One day, I don\u2019t know how it happened, I thought I could write a rodent history.\u201d</p> <p>For one, the rat is an easy marker of climate, drought and environmental change. Their populations grow and shrink with the rains, in thrall to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a. They sustained predator animals such as the letter-winged kite and the taipan, and their decline mirrors the rise of the feral cat.</p> <p>And they illuminate human history too. The settler disdain for Australia is written on the rat, engraved even in the use of \u201crat\u201d in its name. The bilby was lucky, Bonyhady says, to be known by its Indigenous name. \u201cThere are these dozens of native animals which get stigmatised with being characterised as rats or mice or rodents, which makes them very difficult to be seen,\u201d he says. This stigma was behind a push by scientists in the 1970s to call the long-haired rat the <em>mayaroo</em> \u2013 which is what Bonyhady uses throughout as much as possible.</p> <p>Bonyhady recounts that after the first specimen was sent to London, and drawn up in lithograph, it was described by zoologist HH Finlayson 80 years later as \u201cinsufficiently rakish\u201d, with a head \u201ctoo chubby and too small\u201d.</p> <p>In the settler language about rats, they seemed to swell and break, like extensions of the land pushing back at invaders. According to historical reports, the rats seemed to have a special hunger for European food and equipment, ruining leather saddles, even starting bushfires because they nibbled at imported wax matches.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/20/is-that-bum-trap-missing-a-flesh-bag-a-guide-to-australias-convict-slang\">'Is that bum trap missing a flesh-bag?': a guide to Australia\u2019s convict slang</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe long-haired rats fought back,\u201d Bonyhady writes. \u201cPossibly no other Australian animal \u2013 not even the dingo \u2013 responded so aggressively to Europeans.\u201d On the Burke and Wills expedition, they essentially killed the men, he argues. \u201cOne of the survivors revealed that the rat had erased traces of Burke and Wills after they had returned from the Gulf of Carpentaria \u2013 so other members of the expedition did not know their leaders had revisited Camp 65.\u201d Add to that the pair\u2019s refusal to feast on them, because \u201c\u2018civilised\u2019 people did not eat rat\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90af73e4e4c0cf77dad2f7fec6782a188e58150a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90af73e4e4c0cf77dad2f7fec6782a188e58150a/65_58_2471_1692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ludwig Becker, Long-haired Rat, 1861, State Library of Victoria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1861 depiction of a long-haired rat or <em>mayaroo</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ludwig Becker/tate Library of Victoria/Text Publishing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In many ways, this book is about that language and literature itself.

      "bodyText": "Very few words land as heavy as \u201crat\u201d. In almost any sentence it enters, it comes across as demeaning or funny, never beautiful. But hungry for days, tracking circles in the dirt, Burke and Wills might not have died if they had paid one particular species \u2013 the long-haired rat \u2013 the respect it deserved. The Diyari people east of Lake Eyre called it the majaru or mayaroo, and loved it as an easy source of food. The Europeans called it the long-haired rat and refused to eat it. Even dying of hunger, Burke and Wills looked down on them, seeing a shadow of home and disease. The Australian long-haired rat (scientific name Rattus villosissimus) is not just misunderstood, but unknown to many. It is its own distinct species, native and clean, large and cute, and mysteriously at the centre of all kinds of history. Tim Bonyhady\u2019s ode to the rodent, The Enchantment of the Long-Haired Rat, rights this wrong. Part history, part field guide and part folktale, the more you read the more you realise that this bewitching creature is an allegory for Australia itself. The long-haired rat does not carry disease. It does not smell. It is mostly hidden underground, coming above in huge masses after rain. While European rats are \u201ccommensal\u201d (reliant on human populations for food and shelter), the Australian rat is not. It moves through this country\u2019s history as a proud, independent figure, fluffy and odd-looking and, according to Bonyhady, somewhat magical. Bonyhady is a professor in environmental law at the Australian National University and the author of previous books on cultural and art history. The rat is an \u201centry point\u201d into other worlds, he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cThere was something exciting about taking this creature that people hadn\u2019t heard of and having it as my kind of my main thread. I hit on the idea that I could call it a rodent history. We have economic history and environmental history and social history and all those different types. One day, I don\u2019t know how it happened, I thought I could write a rodent history.\u201d For one, the rat is an easy marker of climate, drought and environmental change. Their populations grow and shrink with the rains, in thrall to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a. They sustained predator animals such as the letter-winged kite and the taipan, and their decline mirrors the rise of the feral cat. And they illuminate human history too. The settler disdain for Australia is written on the rat, engraved even in the use of \u201crat\u201d in its name. The bilby was lucky, Bonyhady says, to be known by its Indigenous name. \u201cThere are these dozens of native animals which get stigmatised with being characterised as rats or mice or rodents, which makes them very difficult to be seen,\u201d he says. This stigma was behind a push by scientists in the 1970s to call the long-haired rat the mayaroo \u2013 which is what Bonyhady uses throughout as much as possible. Bonyhady recounts that after the first specimen was sent to London, and drawn up in lithograph, it was described by zoologist HH Finlayson 80 years later as \u201cinsufficiently rakish\u201d, with a head \u201ctoo chubby and too small\u201d. In the settler language about rats, they seemed to swell and break, like extensions of the land pushing back at invaders. According to historical reports, the rats seemed to have a special hunger for European food and equipment, ruining leather saddles, even starting bushfires because they nibbled at imported wax matches. \u201cThe long-haired rats fought back,\u201d Bonyhady writes. \u201cPossibly no other Australian animal \u2013 not even the dingo \u2013 responded so aggressively to Europeans.\u201d On the Burke and Wills expedition, they essentially killed the men, he argues. \u201cOne of the survivors revealed that the rat had erased traces of Burke and Wills after they had returned from the Gulf of Carpentaria \u2013 so other members of the expedition did not know their leaders had revisited Camp 65.\u201d Add to that the pair\u2019s refusal to feast on them, because \u201c\u2018civilised\u2019 people did not eat rat\u201d. In many ways, this book is about that language and literature itself. Like it or not, there is a certain way we talk about rats. There is a rat canon. There are rich stylistic rules. That is part of the fun. Much of the book is quotation, line after line of fantastically vibrant rat reportage from the 19th century. They \u201cpaddled down sandy soil like a flock of sheep\u201d, according to one report. A \u201cperfect army\u201d of them \u201ccrossed the country\u201d, said another. In 1886, local newspaper the Silver Age described them as coming from somewhere \u201cunfathomable\u201d, which Bonyhady describes as \u201ca typical piece of rat writing\u201d. In Bonyhady\u2019s hands, the movement of rats becomes something joyous \u2013 \u201cgambolling about in biscuit barrels\u201d. His rat scenes have the fun of fantasy and the gravity of fable, with an air of Salman Rushdie and a little gloss of magic. \u201cColonists named two places after the long-haired rat,\u201d he writes. \u201cBoth out of horror.\u201d One was at Cooper Creek, where Burke and Wills found a lush waterhole that \u201cappeared ideal by day, lined with trees, surrounded by grass, and rich in waterbirds and fish\u201d. But at night, \u201cthe explorers found themselves under siege \u2026 The rats that attacked in such numbers that the men \u2018could keep nothing from them, unless by suspending in the trees.\u2019\u201d They named it the Rat Hole. (Later in the expedition, they saw two dingoes attacked by rats, who seemed the \u201cundisputable owner\u201d of the turf. They called that place Rat Point.) \u201cThe language shapes so much of how we see these creatures,\u201d Bonyhady says. And for the long-haired rat that language has been devoid of love and wonder for too long. \u201cEnchantment is a key word,\u201d says Bonyhady. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of vital, it has this kind of force. \u201cI have a kind of sense of wonder and attachment to this rat \u2026 It\u2019s written as a work of persuasion I hope. The story that it opens up is about this Australia that is so different to what we otherwise imagined.\u201d \u2022 The Enchantment of the Long-Haired Rat by Tim Bonyhady is out now through Text Publishing",

Despite their exotic nature, the products are heavily promoted through a network of introducers and through internet advertising including on dating sites. They are extremely popular with retail investors. Asic data released on Thursday shows that about a third of investors in binary options or CFDs have an income of less than $37,000 a year. Investors lose about $490m a year on binary options and about $1.5bn a year on CFDs, according to Asic data. The Australian market has also more than doubled in size, from about 450,000 clients to about 1 million over the past two years as other countries, including the UK, Israel and much of the EU, have banned or restricted the products. \u201cOnly 17% of the clients of these products are in Australia,\u201d Asic commissioner Cathie Armour told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe are concerned about the fact that 62% of the clients are located in Asia, the biggest proportion of that in China. \u201cThe Chinese regulators are very clear in our conversations with them that people in China are prohibited from trading in what we call contracts for difference.\u201d The high leverage in CFD products means that a bad move in the market can result in an investor not only losing all the money they have deposited with the provider but also end up owing it substantial amounts of money. \u201cWe have seen a number of complaints from people who didn\u2019t realise the funding costs and found themselves facing significant debts,\u201d Armour said. It is the second time Asic has said it wants to use its new banning powers since they were introduced in April \u2013 in July it said it wanted to ban payday lending products that can result in charges of up to 990% of the amount loaned. Under the new laws, Asic is required to consult with industry before banning or restricting products. Armour said CFDs could be a good investment for some people, and downplayed the idea companies offering them might be driven out of business. \u201cWe think they can have a good and effective business if they operate under the adjustments we\u2019re proposing here,\u201d she said. \u201cHappy customers \u2026 help contribute to a really sustainable business.\u201d The consultation closes on 1 October.",

Journalists also stood in the gallery above the bear pit and applauded as a mark of respect, and possibly contrition, given his rise to the Nationals leadership had been treated derisively by many commentators. During his farewell at the dispatch box, Fischer had cocked an eyebrow at the correspondents and observed: \u201cTo the media I would say this. It was about 12 months ago that you stopped calling me idiosyncratic. I knew then it was time to start thinking about getting out of politics.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Shutting Australia off from the rest of the world behind a protectionist barrier is just plain dumb</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The respect from around the chamber was a collective acknowledgement that Fischer had not taken the easy road during his public service. He had stood with John Howard during the tumultuous times that followed the Coalition\u2019s ascension to power in Canberra in 1996 \u2013 navigating both the gun control debate that followed the Port Arthur massacre, which caused significant grief in the bush, and the rise of Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation party, a disruption to the political landscape that threatened the hegemony of the junior Coalition partner. Fischer\u2019s biographer, Peter Rees, noted: \u201cNever once had Fischer dropped the ball on populism.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/22/tim-fischer-the-former-deputy-prime-minister-and-nationals-leader-dies-aged-73\">Tim Fischer, former deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, dies aged 73</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The departure wasn\u2019t a complete shock. Fischer told the Nine Network in the same month he called time on his leadership that 1998 had been the worst of his 28 years in public life because \u201cwe had to deal out the left and the extreme right\u201d. The battle with One Nation had been enervating, and Fischer felt he was needed at home. His son Harrison had been diagnosed with autism.</p> <p>When Fischer resolved it was time to go to the backbench before leaving politics, after an Apec meeting in Auckland, he informed his close colleagues of his intentions. On the plane ride back to Australia he shared the news with the then Australian Financial Review journalist Brendan Pearson on the basis he would not report the development until the deputy prime minister informed the House. According to Rees\u2019s account of events, confiding in Pearson proved useful to Fischer when Howard tried to persuade him on his return to Canberra to delay the announcement. The Nationals leader told Howard the die was cast. There would be no delay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac989b15f6239938a5045b77f5001074a8f855cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac989b15f6239938a5045b77f5001074a8f855cd/0_72_1581_948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Fischer says goodbye to John Howard at Sydney airport after handing the PM his resignation, 18 July 1999\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Fischer says goodbye to John Howard at Sydney airport after handing the PM his resignation, 18 July 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Timothy Andrew Fischer was a singular political character. He was born on 3 May 1946 in Lockhart, in rural New South Wales. Educated in Melbourne, he served in the army during the Vietnam war before returning to settle in Boree Creek in the Riverina. He went into politics in 1971, first in the NSW state parliament, moving to the federal arena in 1984. He married Judy Brewer later in life, in 1992, and the couple had two sons. Fischer rounded out his professional life as a tourism executive and with an ambassadorial appointment to the Vatican.</p> <p>Fischer was a lifelong railway enthusiast. In his book Steam Locomotives That Galvanised the Nation, Fischer recounts an episode of trainspotting, aged 10, on the Newell Highway over bridge near the Narrandera railway station. His experience of bearing witness is almost rhapsodic. \u201cMy thoughts that morning were fully engaged by the brilliant colour, action and movement of the big black steam locomotive hauling some rust red carriages with gold trimmings.\u201d</p> <p>Closer to home, the contact with trains was more prosaic. The young Tim would accompany his father on Monday nights just after 7pm to collect the Sydney Sunday papers that arrived with passengers on the CPH rail motor. But even that small element of routine burned bright in recollection. \u201cWhat joy as the rail motor with its big searching headlight came sweeping around the corner in winter; a quick whistle stop, and then off it would hurtle into the night.\u201d</p> <p>Trains assumed importance because they were part of the way Fischer encountered the world. Young Tim rode the train to boarding school in Melbourne, battling intense homesickness as the non-sporty chess player struggled to find his tribe at Xavier College. He rode troop trains in the army, and back in the Riverina he loaded sheep and grain and unloaded superphosphate from freight trains.</p> <p>Fischer said he was never a trainspotter in the \u201cclassic British sense\u201d but his lifelong fascination stemmed from wanting to understand the role trains, both passenger and freight, played in the development of modern economies. In some of his writing, Fischer processes the passage of time and societal change by reflecting on the pre-war Australian prime ministers who rode trains, changing transport at state borders because of different gauges, through to his own career navigating the journeys to the parliament in Sydney and in Canberra.</p> <p>During his political career, Fischer made a point of visiting railway stations from Pretoria to Tehran to \u201cget a feel for the standard of living and quality of infrastructure in countries off the beaten track\u201d. During his diplomatic appointment at the Holy See, Fisher contributed to the <a href=\"https://melbournecatholic.org.au/Archive/Kairos/all-aboard-the-caritas-express\">the Caritas Express</a> \u2013 a steam train journey from the Vatican Gardens to Tuscany.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19644c7fb71918215b9bf879f165e8dd64fed6b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19644c7fb71918215b9bf879f165e8dd64fed6b1/0_86_1385_1730/801.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Fisher in 2003\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Fisher launches \u2018The Hat\u2019, a special Akubra designed and given to John Laws to mark his 50th year in broadcasting in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Riviere/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fischer, an imposing physical presence, decked out in an Akubra, with a speaking style possessing the mild echo of a childhood speech impediment, was underestimated by many prominent Canberra commentators when he took the Nationals leadership federally in 1990. The acerbic political commentator Alan Ramsey declared in his inimitable fashion that Fisher was the first dingbat ever to lead the National party.</p> <p>Fischer\u2019s politics were a mixed bag. John Hewson took the trade ministry away from the Nationals during the Fightback period, and Fischer was dogged until he grabbed it back from the Liberals. Unusually for a National of his period, Fischer wasn\u2019t a protectionist, he was an internationalist, and broadly comfortable with the economic rationalism of the Liberal party.</p> <p>Rees notes in his biography Fischer believed rural Australia had to evolve with the times or it would be squeezed out of international markets. In 1996 he told his party\u2019s national conference, \u201cshutting Australia off from the rest of the world behind a protectionist barrier \u2013 trade and human \u2013 is just plain dumb\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fd4a7130ceb5cf1d6eed616e2191a54446b0ecd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fd4a7130ceb5cf1d6eed616e2191a54446b0ecd/28_71_3301_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Fisher and his National party team, 23 March 1993\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Fisher and his National party team, 23 March 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The devout Catholic was socially conservative, and fiercely opposed to gay rights during his time in politics. Fischer was criticised during the Wik and Mabo debates for forcefully taking up the objections of pastoral leaseholders to Indigenous land rights, but while his positions in that debate were contentious, he stood firmly against racism.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Divisive, dumb and wrong</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Fischer on Hansonism</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He spoke out against Hansonism, labelling her interventions on race \u201cdivisive, dumb and wrong\u201d. Fischer, who took on Hanson more forcefully than John Howard, was the only government minister to sign up to the parliamentary code of race ethics championed by Labor and the Australian Democrats.</p> <p>He was also interested in forging closer relationships between Australia and Asia, and during his service in the trade portfolio built up a substantial network of political friends and allies in Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia. He was also a critic of Israel\u2019s aggression against Lebanon, which caused friction with Liberals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"505eaef2c8d4f84edf6d7c6ba0cff4e4f452df38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/505eaef2c8d4f84edf6d7c6ba0cff4e4f452df38/0_156_1938_1163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Fischer speaks with friends, relatives and community representatives during a the Port Arthur memorial, 19 May 1996\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Fischer speaks with friends, relatives and community representatives during a the Port Arthur memorial, 19 May 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gun control debate was enormously difficult for Fischer and the Nationals. The then deputy prime minister stood shoulder to shoulder with Howard in championing regulation after Port Arthur, but there was a fierce backlash in the bush, and there was an open rebellion inside the Nationals, with Fischer under intense pressure from Queensland MPs, including De-Anne Kelly and Bob Katter (who parted ways with the Nationals in 2001). His leadership faced an acute threat.</p> <p>Some of the ugly rallies against gun control included effigies of Fischer. The deputy prime minister told protesters at a rally in Gympie gun control was \u201cabout taking out of the suburbs of Australia the semi-automatics and automatics that should not be in the suburbs of Australia\u201d. As the protesters hurled abuse, a teenage girl took the stage with Fischer to back the deputy prime minister\u2019s stand.</p> <p>The then federal Labor leader Kim Beazley later reflected Fischer could have chosen to allow the Nationals to differentiate themselves from the Liberals in the gun debate because Labor supported the regulations Howard implemented, so Nationals numbers weren\u2019t required to get the changes legislated. \u201cIt would have passed this House very easily without the support of your National party members,\u201d Beazley said in the chamber. \u201cBut you chose not that easy road out. You chose to lay your leadership on the line and persist in a course of action which was right for the country.\u201d</p> <p>Fischer, who died of cancer, is survived by his wife, Judy, and his sons, Harrison and Dominic.</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Fischer, Australian politician, born 3 May 1946; died 22 August 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Tim Fischer, who has died aged 73, announced just after question time on 30 June 1999 that he was quitting as the deputy prime minister of Australia to be more present in the lives of his two young sons, the reaction was unusually sentimental. Sustained applause broke out in the House at the conclusion of Fischer\u2019s farewell, and the standing ovation extended for more than a minute. Journalists also stood in the gallery above the bear pit and applauded as a mark of respect, and possibly contrition, given his rise to the Nationals leadership had been treated derisively by many commentators. During his farewell at the dispatch box, Fischer had cocked an eyebrow at the correspondents and observed: \u201cTo the media I would say this. It was about 12 months ago that you stopped calling me idiosyncratic. I knew then it was time to start thinking about getting out of politics.\u201d The respect from around the chamber was a collective acknowledgement that Fischer had not taken the easy road during his public service. He had stood with John Howard during the tumultuous times that followed the Coalition\u2019s ascension to power in Canberra in 1996 \u2013 navigating both the gun control debate that followed the Port Arthur massacre, which caused significant grief in the bush, and the rise of Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation party, a disruption to the political landscape that threatened the hegemony of the junior Coalition partner. Fischer\u2019s biographer, Peter Rees, noted: \u201cNever once had Fischer dropped the ball on populism.\u201d The departure wasn\u2019t a complete shock. Fischer told the Nine Network in the same month he called time on his leadership that 1998 had been the worst of his 28 years in public life because \u201cwe had to deal out the left and the extreme right\u201d. The battle with One Nation had been enervating, and Fischer felt he was needed at home. His son Harrison had been diagnosed with autism. When Fischer resolved it was time to go to the backbench before leaving politics, after an Apec meeting in Auckland, he informed his close colleagues of his intentions. On the plane ride back to Australia he shared the news with the then Australian Financial Review journalist Brendan Pearson on the basis he would not report the development until the deputy prime minister informed the House. According to Rees\u2019s account of events, confiding in Pearson proved useful to Fischer when Howard tried to persuade him on his return to Canberra to delay the announcement. The Nationals leader told Howard the die was cast. There would be no delay. Timothy Andrew Fischer was a singular political character. He was born on 3 May 1946 in Lockhart, in rural New South Wales. Educated in Melbourne, he served in the army during the Vietnam war before returning to settle in Boree Creek in the Riverina. He went into politics in 1971, first in the NSW state parliament, moving to the federal arena in 1984. He married Judy Brewer later in life, in 1992, and the couple had two sons. Fischer rounded out his professional life as a tourism executive and with an ambassadorial appointment to the Vatican. Fischer was a lifelong railway enthusiast. In his book Steam Locomotives That Galvanised the Nation, Fischer recounts an episode of trainspotting, aged 10, on the Newell Highway over bridge near the Narrandera railway station. His experience of bearing witness is almost rhapsodic. \u201cMy thoughts that morning were fully engaged by the brilliant colour, action and movement of the big black steam locomotive hauling some rust red carriages with gold trimmings.\u201d Closer to home, the contact with trains was more prosaic. The young Tim would accompany his father on Monday nights just after 7pm to collect the Sydney Sunday papers that arrived with passengers on the CPH rail motor. But even that small element of routine burned bright in recollection. \u201cWhat joy as the rail motor with its big searching headlight came sweeping around the corner in winter; a quick whistle stop, and then off it would hurtle into the night.\u201d Trains assumed importance because they were part of the way Fischer encountered the world. Young Tim rode the train to boarding school in Melbourne, battling intense homesickness as the non-sporty chess player struggled to find his tribe at Xavier College. He rode troop trains in the army, and back in the Riverina he loaded sheep and grain and unloaded superphosphate from freight trains. Fischer said he was never a trainspotter in the \u201cclassic British sense\u201d but his lifelong fascination stemmed from wanting to understand the role trains, both passenger and freight, played in the development of modern economies. In some of his writing, Fischer processes the passage of time and societal change by reflecting on the pre-war Australian prime ministers who rode trains, changing transport at state borders because of different gauges, through to his own career navigating the journeys to the parliament in Sydney and in Canberra. During his political career, Fischer made a point of visiting railway stations from Pretoria to Tehran to \u201cget a feel for the standard of living and quality of infrastructure in countries off the beaten track\u201d. During his diplomatic appointment at the Holy See, Fisher contributed to the the Caritas Express \u2013 a steam train journey from the Vatican Gardens to Tuscany. Fischer, an imposing physical presence, decked out in an Akubra, with a speaking style possessing the mild echo of a childhood speech impediment, was underestimated by many prominent Canberra commentators when he took the Nationals leadership federally in 1990. The acerbic political commentator Alan Ramsey declared in his inimitable fashion that Fisher was the first dingbat ever to lead the National party. Fischer\u2019s politics were a mixed bag. John Hewson took the trade ministry away from the Nationals during the Fightback period, and Fischer was dogged until he grabbed it back from the Liberals. Unusually for a National of his period, Fischer wasn\u2019t a protectionist, he was an internationalist, and broadly comfortable with the economic rationalism of the Liberal party. Rees notes in his biography Fischer believed rural Australia had to evolve with the times or it would be squeezed out of international markets. In 1996 he told his party\u2019s national conference, \u201cshutting Australia off from the rest of the world behind a protectionist barrier \u2013 trade and human \u2013 is just plain dumb\u201d. The devout Catholic was socially conservative, and fiercely opposed to gay rights during his time in politics. Fischer was criticised during the Wik and Mabo debates for forcefully taking up the objections of pastoral leaseholders to Indigenous land rights, but while his positions in that debate were contentious, he stood firmly against racism. He spoke out against Hansonism, labelling her interventions on race \u201cdivisive, dumb and wrong\u201d. Fischer, who took on Hanson more forcefully than John Howard, was the only government minister to sign up to the parliamentary code of race ethics championed by Labor and the Australian Democrats. He was also interested in forging closer relationships between Australia and Asia, and during his service in the trade portfolio built up a substantial network of political friends and allies in Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia. He was also a critic of Israel\u2019s aggression against Lebanon, which caused friction with Liberals. The gun control debate was enormously difficult for Fischer and the Nationals. The then deputy prime minister stood shoulder to shoulder with Howard in championing regulation after Port Arthur, but there was a fierce backlash in the bush, and there was an open rebellion inside the Nationals, with Fischer under intense pressure from Queensland MPs, including De-Anne Kelly and Bob Katter (who parted ways with the Nationals in 2001). His leadership faced an acute threat. Some of the ugly rallies against gun control included effigies of Fischer. The deputy prime minister told protesters at a rally in Gympie gun control was \u201cabout taking out of the suburbs of Australia the semi-automatics and automatics that should not be in the suburbs of Australia\u201d. As the protesters hurled abuse, a teenage girl took the stage with Fischer to back the deputy prime minister\u2019s stand. The then federal Labor leader Kim Beazley later reflected Fischer could have chosen to allow the Nationals to differentiate themselves from the Liberals in the gun debate because Labor supported the regulations Howard implemented, so Nationals numbers weren\u2019t required to get the changes legislated. \u201cIt would have passed this House very easily without the support of your National party members,\u201d Beazley said in the chamber. \u201cBut you chose not that easy road out. You chose to lay your leadership on the line and persist in a course of action which was right for the country.\u201d Fischer, who died of cancer, is survived by his wife, Judy, and his sons, Harrison and Dominic. \u2022 Tim Fischer, Australian politician, born 3 May 1946; died 22 August 2019",

The new videos appear to show students giving Nazi salutes, marching with a German flag and wrapping themselves in a Confederate flag, according to a reports from ABC News and the Daily Beast. It was not immediately clear whether they included the same students shown in the previous video. \u201cThis new information, which continues to unfold minute by minute, demands a school-wide call to action to address the severity of these claims to ensure hate speech never happens again,\u201d said Steve Osborne, the Pacifica high school principal. \u201cHate speech will not be tolerated. This is not who we are.\u201d Osborne apologized during a school board meeting on Tuesday for failing to address the original video with the entire school immediately after it was brought to administrators\u2019 attention. He added that the school had been in communication with the Anti-Defamation League and the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles in an effort to expand anti-bias education for students. It\u2019s not the first time a high school in Orange County has dealt with its students engaged in Nazi portrayals. Students from schools in the Newport-Mesa Unified school district faced suspension in an unrelated incident in March after photos emerged of them playing beer pong with cups set up in swastika formation.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re ending our live coverage for the day \u2013 thanks for following along. Here are some key events and links you may have missed: The Trump administration announced a plan to eliminate a federal court agreement and allow the government to indefinitely detain migrant children with their parents. Trump repeated an antisemitic trope that has prompted dismay among prominent American Jews, saying that voting Democratic was \u201cdisloyal to Jewish people and \u2026 very disloyal to Israel\u201d. The Danish prime minister said she was surprised and disappointed that Trump called off his planned visit to the country over Copenhagen\u2019s refusal to sell Greenland to the US. March for Our Lives released a plan to reduce the number of firearms in civilian hands by 30%. A professor at the MIT Media Lab announced he was resigning from the prestigious research center in protest after it was revealed its director took money from Jeffrey Epstein. Trump said the government was weighing whether to abolish birthright citizenship, calling the constitutional right \u201cridiculous\u201d. The president is reportedly considering an executive order that would allow states and cities to deny entry to refugees who have been approved for resettlement. The federal deficit is expected to balloon to a higher than expected level over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A federal judge ruled that Trump can appeal rulings in a lawsuit that challenged his business with foreign governments. The president seemed to struggle to correctly pronounce words today on multiple occasions, a Vox journalist noted: Iceland\u2019s prime minister has said she will not be present for vice president Mike Pence\u2019s visit next month: Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir said it was not meant to be a snub or protest, and that there was a scheduling conflict. It appears that the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, tried to do some damage control today with Denmark after the president abruptly canceled his visit over the rejection of his suggestion that he wanted to buy Greenland. The president is continuing his attacks on auto companies following the news that Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and Honda made a deal with the state of California to reduce pollution. His latest tweet praises the \u201cLegendary Henry Ford\u201d: Some are pointing out that Ford is one of America\u2019s most famous antisemites: The president\u2019s tweets came hours after he repeated antisemitic tropes while criticizing American Jews who vote for Democrats. The New York Times reports that Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, has renewed his push for the Ukrainian government to investigate the president\u2019s political opponents. This came months after Giuliani backed out of a trip to Ukraine after he faced criticism that he was mixing partisan politics with foreign policy: The Times reported: Over the last few weeks, Giuliani has spoken on the phone and held an in-person meeting, in Madrid, with a top representative of the new Ukrainian president, encouraging his government to ramp up investigations into two matters of intense interest to Trump. One is whether Ukrainian officials took steps during the 2016 election to damage Trump\u2019s campaign. The other is whether there was anything improper about the overlap between former Vice President Joseph Biden Jr\u2019s diplomatic efforts in Ukraine and his son\u2019s role with a gas company there. Giuliani said he was acting as a private citizen, but had assistance from the US state department, according to the paper. A reminder of a story that has received very little attention: the president of the United States recently mocked the accents of the leaders of South Korea and Japan at a fundraiser. The AP has published a piece with reactions from Asian Americans, who discussed their painful memories of racist mocking they\u2019ve experienced in their lives: More from the AP: Amanda Berg, a Korean American who grew up in Fort Collins, Colorado, recalled kids doing the \u201cstereotypical pulling at the eyes and the mocking accent.\u201d It made her feel like she was a foreigner in her own community. Berg, a registered Democrat, is among a growing and crucial bloc of Asian American voters leaning further to the left in the age of Trump, and his stunt, reported by the New York Post, angered her and many others. \u201cIt empowers people who would be predisposed to doing that kind of thing anyway,\u201d said Berg, a high school English teacher in Denver. \u201cAnd it makes it acceptable to be openly, increasingly discriminating.\u201d In a speech to a veterans group today, Trump said he wanted to give himself the Medal of Honor: Trump famously got draft deferments to avoid service in Vietnam. The Onion published this yesterday: ABC News has announced new details for the third Democratic primary debate slated for September: If more than ten candidates qualify, the debate will take place over two nights. It\u2019s unclear if that will happen at this stage: If there are ultimately ten or fewer candidates eligible, then the frontrunners in the polls would all face off on the same stage for the first time. Guardian reporter Aben\u00e9 Clayton has an in-depth look at the sweeping gun reform agenda proposed today by March for Our Lives: The proposal released on Wednesday, Peace Plan for a Safer America, includes plans to reduce the number of firearms in civilian hands by 30%, create a mandatory federal gun buyback program for assault weapons, and re-examine the Heller decision \u2013 the 2008 supreme court ruling allowing private citizens to keep handguns in their homes. \u201cThis plan is not geared toward Democrats or Republicans. It\u2019s not about a party, it\u2019s not about politics, it\u2019s about saving lives and prioritizing that,\u201d said Eve Levenson, federal programs manager at March for Our Lives. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to change the culture of gun violence and that is going to require doing some things that are going to make people at first think, \u2018Oh no you\u2019re going to take my guns\u2019,\u201d Levenson continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not about what we\u2019re against, it\u2019s what we\u2019re for,\u201d she added. Read the full story here: And some additional insights from Lois Beckett, the Guardian\u2019s senior reporter on gun policy: Israel\u2019s prime minister has stayed silent on the president\u2019s repeated use of an antisemitic trope in his attacks on American Jews who support Democrats, the AP notes: Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s decision to keep quiet came one week after he barred two Muslim congresswomen from visiting his country, following Trump\u2019s public appeal. Trump has continued today to say that Jews who vote Democratic are \u201cdisloyal to Jewish people and \u2026 very disloyal to Israel\u201d. The silence from Republicans and others on Trump\u2019s comments has provided a sharp contrast to the intense backlash Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has repeatedly faced for her criticisms of Israel. A federal judge has just ruled that Trump can appeal rulings in a lawsuit that challenged his business with foreign governments, in effect, putting the case on hold, the Washington Post reports: The lawsuit was brought by more than 200 congressional Democrats who have alleged that Trump\u2019s hotels and other companies should be barred from taking money from foreign states. The judge\u2019s decision today is a small win for Trump and yet another setback for Democrats and others who have been trying to prevent the president\u2019s private businesses from accepting foreign governments\u2019 payments. Hello - Sam Levin in Los Angeles here, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. A new report says that the Trump administration is considering an executive order that would allow states and cities to deny entry to refugees who have been approved for resettlement: NBC News says it has seen a draft of the proposed executive order, which would undermine efforts to resettle refugees and could violate the intent of existing law that gives the federal government control over refugee policies. This report follows a string of stories today on Trump\u2019s escalating anti-immigrant agenda. The president claimed he was exploring ways to abolish birthright citizenship. His administration has also proposed a regulation that would allow the government to detain families crossing the border indefinitely. The number of House members supporting the impeachment of Donald Trump has edged up to 127, after Rhode Island\u2019s Jim Langevin announced his backing for impeachment this afternoon. \u201cThe prospect of impeaching a President is not something I take lightly,\u201d Langevin said in a statement. \u201cThe power to remove a public official from office is one of the most significant constitutional powers held by Congress, and it must be reserved for extraordinary circumstances. \u201cAfter careful reflection and interaction with my constituents, I believe the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s impeachment inquiry into President Trump\u2019s actions is necessary to gather the evidence Congress needs to make this critical determination.\u201d According to Axios, 126 Democrats and one independent are now in favor of impeachment. Assistant Speaker Rep Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, from New Mexico, came out in favor of an impeachment inquiry on Monday. Luj\u00e1n is the highest ranking Democrat so far to support impeachment. So why did Trump cancel his trip to Greenland? Here\u2019s our video report. Survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting have released a sweeping gun-control plan, which would ban assault-style weapons, institute a national buy-back program and boost federal funding for gun violence research. The group\u2019s leaders said they hope to halve US firearms deaths and injuries within a decade. \u201cThe time for thoughts and prayers has come and gone. It is now time for real change and real action,\u201d David Hogg, Parkland survivor and March for Our Lives co-founder, said in a statement. From Reuters: The plan also calls on the government to automatically register all US citizens to vote when they turn 18, a measure that March for Our Lives has pushed in an effort to turn out the youth vote and sway elections to yield tighter gun policies. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll this month, 69% of Americans said they support \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d firearms restrictions and regulations, including 84% of Democrats and 56% of Republicans. \u2022Donald Trump has attacked the Danish prime minister, describing her as \u201cnasty\u201d. Trump said he cancelled his long-planned trip to Denmark because the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, criticized his attempt to buy Greenland as \u201cabsurd\u201d. \u201cI looked forward to going but I thought the prime minister\u2019s statement that [Trump\u2019s plan to buy Greenland] was \u2018absurd\u2019 [...] I thought it was nasty,\u201d Trump said. \u2022In a busy day for Trump, he announced that the government is weighing whether to abolish birth right citizenship, calling the constitutional right \u201cridiculous\u201d. The 14th amendment, passed after the civil war to ensure that black Americans had full citizenship rights, grants citizenship to \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States\u201d. But Trump said: \u201cWe are looking at birthright citizenship very seriously. It\u2019s frankly ridiculous.\u201d \u2022During the same (impromptu) press conference, Trump doubled down on his antisemitic language. Asked about his remarks that Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats were showing \u201ceither a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty\u201d \u2013 a longstanding antisemitic trope \u2013 the president simply repeated his statement. \u201cIf you vote for a Democrat you\u2019re being very disloyal to Jewish people and you\u2019re being very disloyal to Israel,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u2022A new government regulation would allow the government to detain families crossing the border indefinitely. The rule would abolish the current 20-day limit on how long families can be held in custody. It would effectively replace the decades old Flores agreement, which provided oversight on immigrant children being detained by the government. Update: Trump has finished speaking in Kentucky. He didn\u2019t mention the prime minister of Denmark, or birthright citizenship, or say anything antisemitic, which in light of the rest of his day, makes this an excellent speech. The president walks off the stage to the Rolling Stones You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want \u2013 his campaign anthem, and a song the band has repeatedly asked him to stop using. Here are Donald Trump\u2019s remarks on birthright citizenship earlier \u2013 the president said the government is looking into abolishing the longstanding policy. (A policy enshrined in the US constitution.) Meanwhile the NRA, already being investigated by attorneys generals in Washington DC and New York, is facing more trouble. According to CNN, a Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee \u201caiming to uncover more examples of potential financial impropriety\u201d and \u201cconvince the powerful House committee to launch a formal investigation into the tax-exempt nonprofit\u201d: In a new letter obtained by CNN, Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois has asked the NRA\u2019s former advertising and public-relations firm Ackerman McQueen to release letters, receipts and other materials that document the firm\u2019s financial relationship with the organization. The letter comes as the gun-rights group is engaged in a bitter legal battle with Ackerman amid allegations of financial impropriety. It also comes amid probes from attorneys general in Washington DC and New York into whether the NRA violated its tax-exempt status. Well, so far this is just a campaign speech from Trump. Trump says his government has increased military spending, and reminds the crowd that he has nominated two justices to the Supreme Court. \u201cWe are remaking American greatness. We are America first. It\u2019s about time too,\u201d Trump says. The president tells the crowd he won\u2019t use his some-time new campaign slogan: \u2018Keep America Great\u2019. \u201cI won\u2019t say it here because this is not a campaign speech,\u201d Trump says. Then he says: \u201cKeep America Great.\u201d Trump is now speaking in Louisville, Kentucky. Trump is 40 minutes behind schedule, which is about the length of time he spent talking to reporters outside the White House earlier. According to Associated Press, Trump \u201cplans to discuss his commitment to the military during an address to a gathering of veterans\u201d. He is also expected to \u201cdiscuss suicide prevention and access to health care, along with education and other issues of concern to veterans\u201d. We\u2019ll see if the president sticks to that. His speech is live streamed here. Donald Trump has landed in Louisville, Kentucky, where he is due to speak to at the American Veterans convention at 3pm. Rep John Yarmuth, the Democratic congressman who represents Louisville \u2013 and is Jewish \u2013 has released a statement criticizing Trump\u2019s \u201cvile, hate-filled speech\u201d in anticipation of the president\u2019s visit: Yesterday, sitting in the Oval Office, the President of the United States questioned my intelligence, faith, and loyalty to this country\u2014along with the intelligence, faith, and loyalty of all Jewish Democrats in America. Today, he lands in the city I\u2019ve called home since the day I was born. Mr. President: Louisville is a compassionate and welcoming city, so we will welcome you today. But please know that many of us here stand in defiance of and in opposition to the vile, hate-filled speech you use every day to divide and distract our nation. Enjoy your visit.\u201d Donald Trump, apparently not satisfied with describing the Danish prime minister as \u201cnasty\u201d 45 minutes ago, has resumed attacking Denmark. Tweeting from Air Force One \u2013 Trump is en route to Kentucky \u2013 the president has apparently looked up some information on a favorite hobbyhorse of his: other countries\u2019 contributions to Nato. Trump has now finished his long chat with reporters outside the White House. Several things stood out \u2013 including Trump\u2019s claim that the current birthright citizenship law was \u201cfrankly ridiculous\u201d and that he wanted to abolish it. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at that very seriously, birthright citizenship, where you have a baby on our land, you walk over the border, have a baby - congratulations, the baby is now a US citizen,\u201d Trump said \u2013 mischaracterizing how most such citizenships are granted. \u201cIt\u2019s frankly ridiculous.\u201d Trump had told Axios in October 2018 that he would end \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d through an executive order. But experts have said such a move would not be legal under the US constitution. \u201cFew immigration and constitutional scholars believe it is within the president\u2019s power to change birthright citizenship,\u201d Axios reported at the time. The constituion\u2019s 14th amendment, which grants US citizenship to \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States\u201d, has been routinely been interpreted to grant citizenship to most people born in the United States, whether or not their parents are American citizens or legally living in the United States. Donald Trump has said the government is weighing whether to abolish birth right citizenship, calling the constitutional right \u201cridiculous\u201d. Currently a child born in the US is entitled to a US passport. The constitution\u2019s 14th amendment, passed after the civil war to ensure that black Americans had full citizenship rights, grants citizenship to \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States\u201d. Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Wednesday, Trump said: \u201cWe are looking at birthright citizenship very seriously. It\u2019s frankly ridiculous.\u201d Donald Trump attacked Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen on Wednesday, saying he cancelled his planned trip to Denmark after Frederiksen had been \u201cnasty\u201d towards him. \u201cI looked forward to going but I thought the prime minister\u2019s statement that [Trump\u2019s plan to buy Greenland] was \u2018absurd\u2019 [...] I thought it was nasty,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI thought it was a very not nice way of saying something. They could have told me no.\u201d Trump added: \u201cIt was not a very nice statement the way she blew me off.\u201d Frederiksen had indeed referred to Trump\u2019s apparently impromptu attempt to buy Greenland from Denmark as absurd. Trump was criticized by a raft of Danish politicians for his bid. Trump said: \u201cWe treat countries with respect she shouldn\u2019t treat the United States that way.\u201d Donald Trump has just been speaking as he left the White House en route to Kentucky. Asked about his remarks that Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats were showing \u201ceither a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty\u201d \u2013 a longstanding antisemitic trope \u2013 Trump doubled down on his statement. \u201cIf you vote for a Democrat you\u2019re being very disloyal to Jewish people and you\u2019re being very disloyal to Israel,\u201d Trump told reporters. Trump also repeated his earlier slurs against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members of \u2018the squad\u2019. The four women are \u201canti-Semites\u201d who are \u201cagainst Israel\u201d, Trump said. Half of all Trump voters would at least partially blame him if the economy goes south, according to a new poll. Morning Consult found that 42% of Trump\u2019s 2016 voters would hold the president \u201cpartially responsible\u201d for a recession, while 7% would find Trump \u201csolely responsible\u201d. Of all voters, 69% said they would hold Trump at least partially responsible for a recession, and 28% said he would be solely responsible. It\u2019s not good news for Trump as the economy continues to look shaky. A number of economists have warned that the chances of a recession are growing. The ominous sounding \u201cyield curve\u201d has inverted, which has proceeded every recession in the past 60 years. Here\u2019s an explainer on the economy, yield curves, and recessions by my colleague Dominic Rushe. In some big breaking political news: former White House press secretary Sean Spicer is going on Dancing With the Stars. Spicer\u2019s presence on the new season of the show was announced by ABC on Wednesday. The former press secretary will appear alongside such luminaries as Ally Brooke, from the band Fifth Harmony, and Hannah Brown, who was in season 15 of the Bachelorette. Dancing With the Stars begins on September 16. Spicer does have something of a background in the arts, having portrayed the role of \u2018Easter Bunny\u2019 during the George W Bush administration. In depressing news: Idaho has been forced to change signage on children\u2019s buses after angry drivers began following vehicles full of migrant children. According to the Idaho Statesman: \u201cThe Community Council of Idaho plans to remove and conceal signage on buses they use to transport local children of farmworkers and Head Start participants, after repeated experiences of harassment from motorists across the state, including the Treasure Valley.\u201d The buses are used to transport children to the Community Council, where they can take part in non-profit programs. The vehicles are labelled \u201cMigrant and Seasonal Head Start\u201d, and staff say drivers are harassing the buses because they \u201cassume that migrant means undocumented\u201d. \u201cMigrant doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u2018illegal,\u2019\u201d Alvarez told the Statesman. \u201cMigrant means people move in search of work, which is what our program is. We have people who might move from East Idaho to Caldwell because of the work that they\u2019re in.\u201d The federal deficit is expected to balloon to a higher than expected level over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are projected to shrink gross domestic product by 2020. It\u2019s another headache for Trump as concerns continue to grow over the economy, with serious fears about a looming recession. The non-partisan CBO said the deficit will soar by $800bn more than expected over 10 years. According to CNBC the US budget deficit \u201cis expected to hit $960 billion in 2019, and average a whopping $1.2 trillion per year between 2020 and 2029\u201d: The new deficit projection for 2019 rose $63 billion from the last report, which came out in May. The CBO says this is mainly because of the massive new budget deal, which passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by Trump on Aug. 2. \u201cThe nation\u2019s fiscal outlook is challenging,\u201d CBO director Phillip Swagel said in the report. \u201cFederal debt, which is already high by historical standards, is on an unsustainable course.\u201d Swagel said that the debt is projected to rise even higher after 2029, due to the aging of the U.S. population, growth in health care spending and rising interest costs. Eighteen (!) of the 23 (!!) prominent Democratic candidates for president are speaking at the Iowa Federation Labor Convention today. The presidential hopefuls will address union members in Altoona, beginning at 10am ET and running, presumably, for a long time. \u201c[Union members] want to know that there\u2019s job security for them and that if you are a building trades-member you want to know that there\u2019s gonna be a good economy and that they are going to be able to continue to do work,\u201d Charlie Wishman, Iowa Federation of Labor Secretary-Treasurer, told 13WHOTV. \u201cIf you are somebody who works at the postal service, you want to know that the postal service is protected and that it is not going to be privatized.\u201d It\u2019s another illustration \u2013 if one were needed \u2013 of the importance candidates are placing on Iowa ahead of the state\u2019s February caucuses. In no particular order, the speakers are: John Delaney, Elizabeth Warren, Jay Inslee, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Bill De Blasio, Joe Biden, Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro, Steve Bullock, Tim Ryan, Amy Klobuchar, Michael Benet, Beto O\u2019Rourke, John Hickenlooper, Joe Sestak and Ben Gleib. Some reaction to the Trump administration rule on indefinitely detaining immigrant families: The Trump rule change on detaining immigrant families will be published this week in the Federal Register, and would take effect 60 days later, the New York Times reports: \u201cthough administration officials concede that the expected court challenge will probably delay it\u201d. From the Times: Under the new rule, the administration would be free to send families who are caught crossing the border illegally to a family residential center to be held for as long as it takes for their immigration cases to be decided. Officials said families cases could be resolved within three months, though many could drag on much longer. Trump administration officials \u2014 who briefed reporters on Tuesday night on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans \u2014 said that many of the families would be detained until they were either released after being awarded asylum or they were deported to their home countries. Some families might be awarded parole to leave the facilities while the courts decide their fate. Currently the government may not detain children for more than 20 days unless they are detained in a state facility. The Wall Street Journal reported that the two largest facilities designed to house families, both in Texas, aren\u2019t licensed to house children beyond 20 days. \u201cTo circumvent that requirement,\u201d the Journal wrote: \u201cThe new set of rules would enable the Department of Homeland Security to create its own licensing system, effectively allowing the government to house families in any of its detention facilities through their court proceedings, until they are either granted asylum, paroled into the US or deported.\u201d A new Trump administration regulation would allow the government to detain families crossing the border indefinitely. The new rule would abolish the current 20-day limit on how long families can be held in custody. It would effectively replace the decades old Flores agreement, which provided oversight on immigrant children being detained by the government. The rule is expected to be challenged in court, but adds to the raft of anti-immigration measures Trump is attempting to enforce. So what do people in Denmark think about Trump\u2019s decision to call off his trip to the country? Not much, it seems \u2013 with one former Danish foreign minister comparing Trump to \u201ca clown in a circus\u201d. \u201cThere are already many good reasons to think that the man is a fool, and now he has given another good reason,\u201d Eva Flyvholm, the foreign policy chair for Denmark\u2019s Red-Green Alliance, told Danish media. The Guardian\u2019s Sean Walker reported that former Denmark foreign minister Villy S\u00f8vndal said the decision \u201cconfirms that Donald Trump is a narcissistic fool\u201d. \u201cIf he had been a clown in a circus, you could probably say that there is considerable entertainment value. The problem is that he is the president of the most powerful nation in the world,\u201d S\u00f8vndal said. Trump\u2019s cancellation came, of course, after Denmark refused to sell Greenland to the US. Donald Trump here, quoting right-wing conspiracy theorist Wayne Allen Root\u2019s comments describing Trump as the \u201cKing of Israel\u201d and \u201cthe second coming of god\u201d. Root is a far right crank who has a radio show. He was an early proponent of the racist Obama \u2018birther\u2019 campaign \u2013 which Trump jumped onto. Root also believed Obama was Muslim, and insisted the president was gay, and claimed 2017 Las Vegas shooting was a \u201cmuslim terror attack\u201d. Good morning and welcome to live coverage of the day\u2019s political news. \u2022A number of prominent Republicans are preparing to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency. Former Ohio governor John Kasich, former Arizona senator Jeff Flake, former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford and former congressman Joe Walsh are each in various stages of weighing a run against Trump in the GOP primaries, according to the Washington Post, while former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld launched his own challenge to Trump in April. \u2022Flake and Kasich told the Post they had received a number of approaches from GOP donors encouraging them to run. The hastily convened surge for a non-Trump candidate has been prompted in part by fears over the economy. But despite the excitement over Trump being potentially ousted by a member of his own party, most of the mooted candidates acknowledge they are very unlikely to win. \u2022Jewish leaders have responded furiously to Donald Trump using an antisemitic trope to describe Jewish people who vote for Democrats. Halie Soifer, executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said the comments were \u201cyet another example of Donald Trump continuing to weaponize and politicize antisemitism\u201d, CNN reported, while the Jewish organization J Street called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cdangerous and shameful\u201d. On Tuesday Trump said Jewish Americans who for Democrats were guilty of \u201cgreat disloyalty\u201d, apparently suggesting Jewish Americans have dual loyalty to the US and Israel \u2013 a perception widely considered antisemitic. \u2022A Politico/Morning Consult poll has found Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders as the only candidates beating Trump in 2020. Biden leads Trump by 7% in the survey, with Sanders 5% ahead. Elizabeth Warren was tied with Trump, with most other Democrats trailing. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2%.",
