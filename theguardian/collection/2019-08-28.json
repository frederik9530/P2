The decline is now longer than the 13-month downturn between October 2008 and October 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, described the continued decline as a serious concern. The fall in production has come amid an unprecedented array of challenges for the sector. Diesel sales have slumped following emissions scandals and the trade war between the US and China has added to fears of a global growth slowdown. At the same time, Brexit uncertainty has meant that investment in British factories has stalled and carmakers worldwide are scrambling to find money to make significant investments in electrifying their ranges. \u201cIt\u2019s a very gloomy time in the UK car industry,\u201d said David Bailey, a professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a negative performance in export markets, which is a big worry, because we expected the devaluation of sterling to boost exports.\u201d Manufacturing output was down by 10.6% in July, to 108,239 cars, the SMMT said. British car factories, which make vehicles for companies including Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan and Mini, produced 774,760 cars in the first seven months of the year \u2013 almost a fifth lower than the same time last year. Hawes said: \u201cThe sector is overwhelmingly reliant on exports and the global headwinds are strong, with escalating trade tensions, softening demand and significant technological change.\u201d The weak production came before any possible disruption to operations at the beginning of November if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Economists on Wednesday deemed a no-deal Brexit increasingly likely following the prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks, making it harder for MPs to block a no-deal Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Young adults in the east Midlands have seen their living standards fall the furthest behind the previous generation when compared with their peers elsewhere in Britain, according to a study. At a time when millennials across the country are experiencing lacklustre gains in living standards compared with the generation before them, the Resolution Foundation said the region that includes Nottingham and Leicester had seen the biggest shortfall in earnings growth. The thinktank said those in the region aged between 26 and 28 were earning about 2.7% less, adjusted for inflation, than people of their age were earning in 2003. The analysis has found that generational progress on pay has been weak nationally, with those born in the late 1980s earning just 3% more at ages 26-28 than those born in the early 1970s at the same stage in life. In stark contrast, those born in the early 1970s earned 16% more at the age of 28 than those born 15 years before them in the late 1950s. While most regions had seen some improvement, millennials in the east midlands, south-east and London all earned less in their late 20s than the previous generation. However, young people in the north\u2013east have made considerable pay progress, with millennials earning 13% more at the age of 26-28 than those born 15 years earlier. Funded by the Nuffield Foundation, the research also showed that homeownership rates have collapsed for young adults across the country, while the amount of money millennials spend on housing as a share of their income has rocketed. Amid concern across the political spectrum over the difficulty facing young adults in getting on the housing ladder, the research showed that the proportion of 26- to 28-year-olds who owned their own home had collapsed by half since 1997. London recorded the biggest fall, with homeownership rates falling by 58%. Among 26- to 28-year-olds in the capital, as few as 8% own their home, compared with 20% for the same age group in 1997. Across the country, the rate of homeownership has dropped from 33.5% to 17.2%.

It is illegal to sell a knife to anyone under the age of 18, yet the new data shows that of 2,231 official \u201ctest purchases\u201d in England and Wales over 12 months to the end of March, retailers failed to prevent the sale of a weapon to a child on 344 separate occasions (15%). Poundland, Home Bargains, Asda and Tesco sold knives to children at least 15 times each during the tests. Separately, 100 online test purchases were carried out for the first time. These led to an even higher rate of purchase, with children buying knives on 41 occasions. In April the Co-op said it had stopped selling kitchen knives in response to soaring levels of knife crime in the UK. The previous month Asda said it would withdraw single kitchen knives from its stores, adding that single knives were stolen more often than sets of knives. Toby Harris, chair of National Trading Standards, said: \u201cRestricting the sale of knives to children is clearly a difficult issue for retailers, especially those with large numbers of outlets, staff and delivery partners, and I am aware that many retailers are working incredibly hard to train staff and introduce robust procedures to stem the flow of knives to children. \u201cBut our tests show that it\u2019s still too easy for a child to buy a knife in store or online. We know that young people are being cautioned and convicted for knife crime offences, and as such I urge all retailers to do more.\u201d Kit Malthouse, minister for policing and crime, said: \u201cI am deeply concerned to see some retailers are breaking the law and I expect them to take urgent action to stop young people from getting hold of knives in the first place.\u201d In 2018 the discount retail chain B&amp;M was ordered to pay \u00a3480,000 in fines and \u00a312,428 in costs after selling knives to children. Croydon trading standards has recently successfully prosecuted companies for selling knives online. Responding to the findings, Asda said: \u201cWhile we are clearly disappointed with the results from a small number of cases between April 2018 and March 2019, we would like to reassure customers that we have since provided updated training for colleagues and have clear policies in place to ensure we meet all our responsibilities as a retailer.\u201d Tesco said it had toughened up its display and sales policies, with changes introduced after the test purchase period. A spokesman said: \u201cTesco takes the safety of our colleagues, customers and the communities we serve very seriously, and we have made significant changes to our approach, including a two-stage age verification process.\u201d The Guardian revealed this month that knives can be purchased on Facebook Marketplace without age verification despite a recent law requiring checks.",

      "bodyText": "Mathias Cormann has defended his use of special-purpose flights, after the ABC revealed that he and Peter Dutton charged taxpayers more than $50,000 to travel on defence jets in the week after the Liberal spill. The flights allowed the finance minister and home affairs minister to attend swearing-in ceremonies after they resigned from Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s ministry before taking back their positions in Scott Morrison\u2019s cabinet. Royal Australian Air Force flight records tabled in parliament show on 28 August Cormann flew from Canberra to Perth on a CL604 at a cost of $23,000. A further $14,720 cost was incurred to return the empty aircraft to Canberra. On 26 August, the Sunday following the spill, Dutton flew from Canberra to Amberley at a cost of $5,980 and Amberley to Canberra at a cost of $6,900. According to the ABC, Dutton declined to comment but said at the time \u201cthe swearing-in today will allow me to travel to the Gold Coast to attend the Five Country ministerial meeting\u201d, involving security and immigration ministers from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the United States. Cormann was sworn in with the remainder of the ministry on Tuesday 28 August, after which the Morrison cabinet held its first meeting. A spokesperson for Cormann reportedly said the role of defence jets was to allow ministers to meet commitments associated with their official, parliamentary or political responsibilities, and the cost of travel was higher for MPs from Perth. \u201cIn the context of the high frequency of necessary work-related travel from Perth to Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne and back, Senator Cormann is an infrequent user of the special purpose aircraft \u2013 and only if that use is appropriate in the circumstances. \u201cOn 28 August 2018 Senator Cormann was required both in Canberra and back in Perth later that day. \u201cInevitably that travel from Canberra to Perth is more expensive than travel to locations on the east coast. \u201cTwo senior staff also travelled with the minister on this occasion to facilitate dealing with office work on the five-hour trip back from Canberra to Perth that day.\u201d Ministerial travel rules allow for use of defence jets if suitable commercial alternatives are not available. Cormann\u2019s spokesperson said no commercial flight options were available \u201cto accommodate all these commitments\u201d and the use of the jets was approved \u201cin the appropriate way\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Marco Silva was impressed by the character of his Everton side in a pulsating second-round Carabao Cup tie after they responded to going behind after 21 seconds to book a meeting with Sheffield Wednesday. Silva has targeted good cup runs this season as Everton search for their first silverware since the 1995 FA Cup. That appeared to be little more than a distant dream as Lincoln quickly took the lead when Harry Anderson fired home Jack Payne\u2019s cutback. Lucas Digne equalised with a 30-yard free-kick before Gylfi Sigurdsson put the visitors ahead with a penalty after Morgan Schneiderlin was fouled by Michael O\u2019Connor, firing high into the corner with the England keeper Jordan Pickford running the length of the field to get involved and being booked for his trouble. It seemed as if Everton had weathered the storm only for Lincoln to level when Bruno Andrade scored the crispest of volleys after a cross from the right was partially cleared. Back came Everton again with Alex Iwobi nodding home before Richarlison put the game beyond doubt with an unstoppable header. The final score was harsh on the home side who were still level with nine minutes left but Everton\u2019s dominance paid off and it was the response to their early setback that most impressed Silva. He said: \u201cWe knew before the match how difficult it is always to play this type of competition.

The fossil belongs to an ancient hominin, Australopithecus anamensis, believed to be the direct ancestor of the famous \u201cLucy\u201d species, Australopithecus afarensis. It dates back to a time when our ancestors were emerging from the trees to walk on two legs, but still had distinctly ape-like protruding faces, powerful jaws and small brains, and is the oldest-known member of the Australopithecus group. While Lucy became celebrated in studies of human evolution, her direct predecessor has remained a shadowy trace on the record, with only a handful of teeth, some limb bones and a few fragments of skull to provide clues about appearance and lifestyle. The latest specimen, a remarkably complete adult male skull casually named MRD, changes this. \u201cIt is good to finally be able to put a face to the name,\u201d said Stephanie Melillo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, based in Germany, who is the co-author of an analysis of the find. Prof Fred Spoor of the Natural History Museum, London, who was not involved in the research, said the discovery of MRD \u2013 and its dating to a period when the fossil record is very sparse \u2013 would substantially affect thinking on the evolutionary family tree of early hominins. \u201cThis cranium looks set to become another celebrated icon of human evolution,\u201d he said. The skull shows that MRD had a small brain \u2013 about a quarter of the size of a modern human \u2013 but was already losing some of its ape-like features. Its canines are smaller than those seen in even earlier fossils and it is already developing the powerful jaw and prominent cheekbones seen in Lucy and the famous Mrs Ples fossil (another later member of the Australopithecus group), which scientists think helped them chew tough food during dry seasons when less vegetation was available. The dating of the skull also reveals that Anamensis and its descendent species, Lucy, coexisted for a period of at least 100,000 years.

In view of this, I urge our courts to urgently hear my application for Judicial Review before 9 September 2019 \u2013 the earliest date that Prorogation of Parliament could come into effect.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe have all been comprehensively misled by the Prime Minister and his lawyers.

This is the battleground Johnson seeks \u2013 himself as roguish, freewheeling representative of the people\u2019s will, defender of the referendum versus the Westminster establishment and the elite, as represented by MPs elected to parliament. Explosive, dangerous, unresolvable, David Cameron\u2019s reckless, Tory-pleasing referendum cut right through the constitution, and now it lies badly damaged.</p> \n   <p>This assault on parliament is galvanising those soft Tory opponents who were prevaricating, the ones who preferred to wait until late October to give Johnson a chance to strike a new EU deal. Now, say Dominic Grieve and others, they all realise the one week before prorogation must be used to legislate against a no-deal Brexit. There is just time, there are manoeuvres, from seizing the timetable to a humble address and other ingenious devices murmured sotto voce lest the government hear their plans. It can be done, must be done, double quick, it\u2019s too late to wait until they return in October.</p> \n   <p>The war for public hearts and minds has hardly begun. Which side will people lean, towards a sense their constitution and their parliament has been outraged by a revolutionary rightwinger?

When it was discussed before I thought that he was saying what he wanted to get Tory members to vote for him. To the claim that he wants to kill parliamentary democracy for democratic reasons is beyond laughable. Nobody made him dictator, it\u2019s a blatant ploy to get a general election triggered ... He will go down as the worst PM of all time and after the last two that\u2019s saying something! We need to Stop Boris and save our democracy!\u201d</p> \n  <p>Catherine Ogden, a retired primary school teacher who is on her way to a protest in Manchester said that she was taking part on behalf of her daughter, who is living in Spain. <br>\u201cThis is an orchestrated attempt to shut out our elected members of parliament from debating an issue that will affect us for generations to come. This is not about leave or remain anymore, this is about a three-year long offence against the democratic rights of British citizens, at home and abroad. Whichever side of the debate you stand, this has not been a clean fight and the consequences will be grave.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Other readers who have contacted the Guardian have said that they feel angry and fearful about what could happen next. Barbara, who lives in the south-west of England, said that she is \u201creally upset, angry and scared to death by this outrageous government and it\u2019s dictatorial approach to Brexit. </p> \n  <p>\u201cSuspending parliament is the most undemocratic and sinister move imaginable and is dictatorial in the extreme. MPs must be allowed to debate a decision like Brexit, which has split the country and continues to do so.

It means parliament\u2019s sitting is suspended and it ends all current legislation under discussion.</p> \n  <p>It is normal for this to happen every autumn. The current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years.</p> \n  <h2>Can MPs vote against prorogation?</h2> \n  <p>No. Parliament is due to go on a three-week conference recess anyway in the second week of September and there had been suggestions MPs would vote against holding this recess, or any attempt to extend it. However, proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in this way.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T16:03:59.883Z\">at 5.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d669f4b8f08ea59f447ab21\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T15:41:11.537Z\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rees-Mogg: 'This is a completely normal procedure'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Jacob Rees-Mogg has been doorstepped at Aberdeen airport where journalists followed him through the terminal after his privy council meeting with the Queen.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnything the Queen says is private, as you know,\u201d said Rees-Mogg, who was one of three members of the council who went to Balmoral to ask permission on behalf of the prime minister for the prorogation of parliament.</p> \n  <p>Asked if he was confident that the move would not be up for challenge in the courts, he replied: \u201cThe courts will come to their decision but this is a completely normal procedure.\u201d<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FraserNicoll/status/1166705890197684224\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jacob Rees-Mogg arriving at Aberdeen airport having met with the Queen at Balmoral. <a href=\"https://t.co/aMtAPZ31Yj\">pic.twitter.com/aMtAPZ31Yj</a></p>\u2014 Fraser Nicoll (@FraserNicoll) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FraserNicoll/status/1166705890197684224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 28, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T15:48:28.985Z\">at 4.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6699cc8f082209d322333f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-proctor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T15:19:10.246Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Vince Cable to stand down as MP at next election</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some non-prorogation news now. Our political correspondent Kate Proctor reports that there is speculation that the Liberal Democrats are preparing to welcome another defector, after their former leader Vince Cable announced he would stand down as an MP at the next election. </p> \n  <p>The candidate for Cable\u2019s Twickenham seat, which he won back from the Conservatives in the 2017 general election, will be chosen from an all-female shortlist. Those wanting to stand have until midday on Friday to say so. A spokesman for the party said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Vince has enjoyed a fantastic parliamentary career in the Liberal Democrats and representing the people of Twickenham. He will continue to serve as the MP until the next election, whenever that may be.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The vacancy opens up the possibility that the rumoured defection of another former Change UK MP will soon follow, with new members to be announced at the party\u2019s autumn conference in Bournemouth. </p> \n  <p>Senior party figures have said they are holding out for Heidi Allen, Luciana Berger or Angela Smith to make the switch and follow their former colleague Sarah Wollaston. A source said: \u201cTwickenham coming into play has certainly raised the levels of speculation about defections.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Berger said she was still deciding what to do at the next election. The former MP Sarah Olney, who briefly took the Richmond Park seat from Zac Goldsmith before losing it months later in 2017, was briefly rumoured for Twickenham but has been reselected as the candidate in Richmond. </p> \n  <p>The all-women shortlist quashes rumours that the former Labour MP and now Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, could switch from running in Streatham to Twickenham, where Cable had a 9,000 majority. <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d49a9630377bb2d706d2b94a115f43a7683088d6\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d49a9630377bb2d706d2b94a115f43a7683088d6/0_180_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vince Cable will step down as an MP at the next election.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vince Cable will step down as an MP at the next election.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mirzoeff/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T15:38:34.532Z\">at 4.38pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6695728f082209d32232f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T15:01:10.827Z\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll has been listening to the Irish deputy PM, Simon Coveney, and the UK\u2019s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, speaking at a conference in Paris.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lisaocarroll/status/1166709770935554048\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">simon Coveney listening to Stephen Barclay at Paris conference <a href=\"https://t.co/1dBhiXJRtx\">pic.twitter.com/1dBhiXJRtx</a></p>\u2014 lisa o'carroll (@lisaocarroll) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lisaocarroll/status/1166709770935554048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 28, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lisaocarroll/status/1166712993738121217\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ireland no budging on backstop.

Tavish Scott, previously a Scottish Lib Dems leader, won in 2016 with 67% of the vote, a majority of 4,865 over the SNP.</p> \n  <p>The contiguous Westminster seat of Orkney and Shetland has been a Lib Dem constituency since 1950 and is the party\u2019s safest in the UK, but Sturgeon and the SNP have shovelled huge resources into the contest to succeed Scott, who stood down in June to work instead for Scottish Rugby.</p> \n  <p> An SNP win tomorrow would be cited as clear proof that Scottish voters now favour independence from the rest of the UK after Brexit. Shetland historically has been sceptical about the case for leaving the UK.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon has visited Shetland to campaign three times in recent weeks, alongside numerous Holyrood ministers and SNP MPs and MSPs, inviting criticism from her opponents after one visit meant she failed to appear at a government press event disclosing a multibillion-pound public spending deficit in Scotland last year.</p> \n  <p> The Scottish Tories pointed out Sturgeon had visited Shetland as many times in the last month as she had during her previous five years as first minister. Brydon Goodland, the Tory candidate for Shetland, said: \u201cThe SNP only care about Shetland when there are votes to be won.\u201d</p> \n  <p> The final message to voters from Tom Wills, the SNP\u2019s young candidate, was Brexit-focused. He claimed the SNP was \u201cby some distance the strongest pro-European party in the UK\u201d with 100 parliamentarians at Scottish, UK and European level focused on stopping the UK leaving the EU.</p> \n  <p> The Lib Dems reject the implication they are softer on Brexit. After all, their European election campaign slogan was \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d. But observers on Shetland say the Lib Dem campaign has suffered greatly from the lacklustre performance of its candidate, Beatrice Wishart , while Wills has energised younger voters.</p> \n  <p> Much hinges on turnout. The Lib Dems hope the island\u2019s broadly conservative voters will treat with cynicism Wills\u2019s claims that the SNP will slash ferry and air fares for islanders, increase housing spending and protect fishing interests.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T14:34:24.387Z\">at 3.34pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d668df78f08ea59f447aa14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T14:23:22.766Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the document with the orders approved at today\u2019s meeting of the privy council at Balmoral.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"A list of the orders approved at the meeting of the privy council at Balmoral on Wednesday\"> \n   <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Orders Approved and Business Transacted\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/423532919/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=slideshow&amp;access_key=key-dh3bvLPKuN3RPxZSsZKY&amp;show_recommendations=true\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7068965517241379\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_94627\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n   <figcaption>\n    A list of the orders approved at the meeting of the privy council at Balmoral on Wednesday.\n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T14:28:31.068Z\">at 3.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d668d888f08ea59f447aa10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T14:20:33.775Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Anna Soubry has become the latest MP to write to the Queen today to ask for a meeting ...</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Anna_Soubry/status/1166711984315949058\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have written to HM the Queen asking her for a meeting with other Privy Councillors following the PMs anti democratic proposal to prorogue Parliament.</p>\u2014 Anna Soubry MP (@Anna_Soubry) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Anna_Soubry/status/1166711984315949058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 28, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d668c478f08ea59f447aa0c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T14:18:25.274Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is <a href=\"https://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Orders-Approved-and-Business-Transacted.pdf\">the document</a> with the orders approved at the privy council at Balmoral today.

      "bodyText": "I will be wrapping up now, as another historic day in British politics is coming to an end. At a glance, this is what happened: During a meeting of the privy council with the Queen, the monarch has consented to the prorogation of parliament, as requested by prime minister Boris Johnson in what is widely considered a bid to push through a no deal Brexit. Parliament will thus be dissolved, unless MPs or campaigners will manage to trash this plan over the coming days, between September 9th and September 12th, until October 14th. This would leave MPs with only a few days to put a stop to a no-deal Brexit or Brexit altogether. Markets jittered in anticipation of a no deal exit that is now more likely than ever before. MPs and campaigners across the political spectrum have reacted with outrage to the PM\u2019s prorogation plans. Protests were held in towns across the UK, and a cross-party group of MPs has vowed to try everything in their power to avert prorogation. The former chancellor Philip Hammond said MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit will \u201chave to do something\u201d when parliament returns next week. Johnson\u2019s government has argued that the current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years. Brexit hardliner Jacob Rees-Mogg described the planned prorogation as \u201ca completely normal procedure\u201d. Several legal challenges have been launched against the plan, one of them spearheaded by the campaigner Gina Miller. A petition calling to stop the prorogation of parliament has reached more than 1 million signatures. In what is regarded a blow to Boris Johnson, Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, has announced her imminent resignation from her role as party leader, a move that could cost the PM a majority at the next general election. That\u2019s all from me, goodnight. Diane Abbott said in an interview with the BBC: \u201cBoris does not represent the people, he\u2019s never represented the people. This is Boris versus the people. And the people are going to fight.\u201d This from Welsh Labour MP Anna McMorrin: Ruth Davidson will step down as party leader without much further ado, reports ITV\u2019s Scotland correspondent Peter A Smith: This from independent MP Angela Smith, formerly Labour: The \u201cDo not prorogue Parliament\u201d petition is still flying, and has now reached more than 900,000 signatures. Here my colleague Matthew Weaver\u2019s story: Also, in case you hadn\u2019t seen this tweet by Hugh Grant, which has been very popular, while the name Hugh is trending, here it is: People on Twitter have begun debating the legitimacy of the Queen\u2019s role, as well as questioning the future of Britain\u2019s constitutional monarchy. The hashtag #AbolishTheMonarchy is currently trending. This from Apolitical\u2019s Josh Lowe: And this from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall: Conservative MP Sam Gyimah also found strong words earlier today: A consensus regarding Boris Johnson\u2019s main motive for dissolving parliament is emerging from the quarter of prorogation opponents. This from Labour MP Richard Burgon: My colleague Tom Kibasi wrote about this earlier: But even if Johnson gets his \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d general election, it\u2019s likely to come with a number of caveats, as Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall points out: This is Ed Miliband\u2019s verdict on today\u2019s developments: Quite a few people seem to be ruminating on the future of chancellor Sajid Javid tonight. This from the journalist Ian Fraser: And this from Stefan Rousseau, chief political photographer at the Press Association - (the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg retweeted): People across the UK took to the streets tonight to demonstrate against the Queen\u2019s approval of the prime minister\u2019s plans to prorogue parliament. Lawyers for campaigner Gina Miller have made an urgent application to the high court for a judicial review of Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to prorogue parliament. It is the first shot in what will be an intense battle in the coming days to torpedo his plan. \u201cThis is a brazen attempt, of truly historical magnitude, to prevent the executive being held accountable for its conduct before Parliament,\u201d said Miller. She had received legal correspondence from the government legal officers in the last two weeks stating that the issue of prorogation is of no more than \u201cacademic\u201d interest and she says this now proves that Johnson has misled the nation. \u201cIt is, sadly, all too clear from today\u2019s announcements, that prorogation is a desperate reality, not a mere theoretical nicety. In view of this, I urge our courts to urgently hear my application for Judicial Review before 9 September 2019 \u2013 the earliest date that Prorogation of Parliament could come into effect. \u201cWe have all been comprehensively misled by the Prime Minister and his lawyers. A reply from the Government Legal Department received late on 27 August stated: \u2018The proposed intention to bring legal proceedings in respect of events which have not occurred and may never do so is noted. For the avoidance of doubt, we do not accept that the approach taken in your letter is an appropriate one.\u2019,\u201d she said in a statement issued tonight. \u201cTo put this in an official legal letter and send it out at the same time as you are drafting a press release confirming Parliament\u2019s suspension the following morning illustrates just how manipulative and anti-democratic this Prime Minister and his Government really are. \u201cThe basis of my approach to the courts is that it cannot be legitimate or a proper use of the prerogative power to prorogue Parliament when the intention and effect inherent in doing so is to frustrate Parliament and fetter it from exercising its sovereign right to fulfil its elective role and enact any law it sees fit.\u201d MPs continue to rebuke the PM\u2019s prorogation plans on Twitter. My colleague Polly Toynbee has written a column about the possible consequences of today\u2019s events, and predicts an impending civil war. She writes: This aggressive provocation of parliament widens the great Brexit divide into a civil war state of mind. This is the battleground Johnson seeks \u2013 himself as roguish, freewheeling representative of the people\u2019s will, defender of the referendum versus the Westminster establishment and the elite, as represented by MPs elected to parliament. Explosive, dangerous, unresolvable, David Cameron\u2019s reckless, Tory-pleasing referendum cut right through the constitution, and now it lies badly damaged. This assault on parliament is galvanising those soft Tory opponents who were prevaricating, the ones who preferred to wait until late October to give Johnson a chance to strike a new EU deal. Now, say Dominic Grieve and others, they all realise the one week before prorogation must be used to legislate against a no-deal Brexit. There is just time, there are manoeuvres, from seizing the timetable to a humble address and other ingenious devices murmured sotto voce lest the government hear their plans. It can be done, must be done, double quick, it\u2019s too late to wait until they return in October. The war for public hearts and minds has hardly begun. Which side will people lean, towards a sense their constitution and their parliament has been outraged by a revolutionary rightwinger? Or will they go with Johnson as the true representative of the people, leading angry Brexiters to their hearts\u2019 desire? He has the advantage of the great claque of the 80% Tory press urging him on. This is only step one of Johnson\u2019s \u201cby any means necessary\u201d threat. Expect more such \u201cmeans\u201d yet to come. Link to full piece below. The Welsh Labour MP Stephen Doughty called Boris Johnson a \u201ccoward\u201d in an interview on ITV. I think what we\u2019ve seen here is a sly, underhand move by the prime minister, a fundamentally undemocratic and unconstitutional move, which goes against the interest of the people of Wales and the ability of all of us representing our constituents who elected us to have their voices heard in parliament. Boris Johnson has a very hazy relationship with the truth and we are unable to hold him and his ministers to account at the moment, let alone his unelected, shadowy advisors sitting there, trying to drag this country off a cliff. Why is he so afraid of parliament sitting? Things seem to be getting more heated outside parliament, according to the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne: This from the Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, who believes the dissolution of parliament will lead to a catalogue of \u201cmodern compassionate Conservative reform\u201d. Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, has tweeted the following statement: And this from my colleague Heather Stewart: This from Channel 4\u2019s Hayley Barlow on how the leaders of Britain\u2019s two biggest parties have communicated with the public today. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley: My colleagues Aamna Mohdin and Marvel Kalukembi are reporting from parliament square in London on the protests: The crowds at Commons Greens, opposite parliament, have shut down a major road, chanting \u201cstop the coup.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, Boris Johnson is the main subject of ire on many people\u2019s placards, with some stating: \u201cBollocks to Boris\u201d. Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green was one of many oppositional politicians at the protest. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re here to stand against Boris Johnson\u2019s coup. We have a representative democracy and by suspending parliament, you are removing people\u2019s democratic right.\u201d Womack said she\u2019s both surprised and not by Johnson\u2019s move to suspend parliament.\u201dI feel like we\u2019ve been expecting this for a while but I didn\u2019t think he would make such a brutal move that showed such a disregard for our parliamentary procedures.\u201d She added: \u201cI think what he has done is unite parts of the country who don\u2019t support a no deal and his form of process that is denying democracy. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue the work we\u2019ve been doing to secure a people\u2019s vote so the people have a final say and ensure within parliament we are working cross party to prevent a no deal.\u201d Jane Keane, 54 years old, said she\u2019s been protesting every day since Michael Gove said there would be preparations for a no deal. \u201cIt is a complete contradiction to what parliament has said three times. They\u2019ve said no deal is unacceptable. My understanding is parliament is sovereign not Boris Johnson.\u201d She said she didn\u2019t have a history of activism and has largely remained neutral in politics because of the work she\u2019s done with local government. But she said as someone who has recently survived, she knows how important it is to have easy access medical supplies. It remains unclear whether Ruth Davidson is also planning to quit as an MSP if, as is widely expected, she announces her resignation as Scottish Tory leader on Thursday. Sebastian Payne at the Financial Times has tweeted she plans to stay on as a backbencher but Chris Musson, the Scottish Sun political editor, who broke the story of Davidson\u2019s resignation as leader, is not so sure. If she does resign from Holyrood as well, that throws up the real prospect of the Scottish National party winning her seat of Edinburgh Central, a constituency Davidson won unexpectedly in 2016 but with a slender majority of 610 votes. It is being eyed up by Angus Robertson, the SNP\u2019s former Westminster leader and election strategist, who lost his Commons seat of Moray to the Tories in the 2017 snap election. Given Labour\u2019s weakness in Scotland, he would be confident the SNP would win comfortably by harnessing a very strong anti-Brexit vote in the city. And Holyrood is already braced for the result of tomorrow\u2019s Scottish parliamentary byelection in Shetland, where the SNP hope to win a remarkable victory, by defeating the Liberal Democrats in one of its electoral strongholds. The Lib Dems have held Shetland since the foundation of the Scottish parliament in 1999 and the contiguous Westminster seat of Orkney and Shetland since 1950 (then as the Liberals). Senior Lib Dems are adamant they will hold on, but many Shetlanders scent an upset. That could change the parliamentary arithmetic at Holyrood significantly: Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister and SNP leader, is two seats short of a majority. If the SNP wins either seat, they would then have the same votes as all the opposition parties together. If they win both, they regain the overall majority they lost in 2016 and also a much more powerful political case for staging a second referendum. Given those numbers, would Davidson risk the union she has fought so hard to protect by quitting Holyrood? Angela Smith, the leader of the opposition in the House of Lords, has launched a searing attack on Boris Johnson\u2019s government. Writing in the House magazine, the former Labour MP lambasted the PM\u2019s prorogation plans as \u201cTrumpesque at heart\u201d. Despite ongoing speculation that Boris Johnson would try to shut down Parliament before Brexit Day, the formal announcement from No.10 was still deeply shocking and disturbing. Having so often been told that our exit from the European Union was about \u2018taking back control\u2019, it appears our new Prime Minister wants that power to reside with him alone. Lacking the legitimacy of the ballot box, or any public endorsement, Mr Johnson now seeks to thwart the will of the House of Commons by just shutting it down to try to stop elected MPs from doing the job they were elected to. A constitutional outrage, verging on a coup and one that must be challenged. The action of an autocrat not a democrat, the Prime Minister\u2019s decision is part of a pattern of arrogance that is Trumpesque at heart \u2013 far removed from the Churchillian statesmanship that he would like people to believe he possesses. And such an act of political chicanery also risks compromising the political independence of our monarch. Around the world, Westminster has been admired as the \u2018Mother of Parliaments\u2019 but this move from Mr Johnson will embarrass us internationally. Brexit and the way it has been handled has divided our country and our politics. At the time when we most need calm, moderate, thoughtful leadership \u2013 in the national interest \u2013 we are now lumbered with a man without either the skills or integrity to hold this any other high office. Opposition to such an authoritarian approach is unifying people from across the political divide \u2013 the Prime Minister\u2019s only support appears to be from the government\u2019s confidence and supply allies, the DUP. That said, anger and outrage will not be enough. Parliamentarians from across all parties and none \u2013 and in both Houses \u2013 must assert the authority of those elected to the Commons. I have taken part in two prorogation ceremonies in my four years as leader of the opposition in the Lords. Like many traditions, its roots go way back. Whilst the pomp, ceremony and outfits appear somewhat anachronistic, they are part of a proud historical tradition. The next prorogation should therefore be uncontroversial \u2013 just part of how our Parliament functions. If however, Mr Johnson\u2019s reckless disregard for Parliament goes ahead in the way he clearly wishes it to, it will be anything but. Guardian readers have been getting in touch to tell us about why they\u2019re planning on protesting against Boris Johnson suspending parliament. Many have expressed their concern over what they consider an undemocratic move by Johnson. Aforji Churjor, who works in FX sales in London, has said that he\u2019s going to parliament to protest. \u201cI genuinely couldn\u2019t believe he would actually do it. When it was discussed before I thought that he was saying what he wanted to get Tory members to vote for him. To the claim that he wants to kill parliamentary democracy for democratic reasons is beyond laughable. Nobody made him dictator, it\u2019s a blatant ploy to get a general election triggered ... He will go down as the worst PM of all time and after the last two that\u2019s saying something! We need to Stop Boris and save our democracy!\u201d Catherine Ogden, a retired primary school teacher who is on her way to a protest in Manchester said that she was taking part on behalf of her daughter, who is living in Spain. \u201cThis is an orchestrated attempt to shut out our elected members of parliament from debating an issue that will affect us for generations to come. This is not about leave or remain anymore, this is about a three-year long offence against the democratic rights of British citizens, at home and abroad. Whichever side of the debate you stand, this has not been a clean fight and the consequences will be grave.\u201d Other readers who have contacted the Guardian have said that they feel angry and fearful about what could happen next. Barbara, who lives in the south-west of England, said that she is \u201creally upset, angry and scared to death by this outrageous government and it\u2019s dictatorial approach to Brexit. \u201cSuspending parliament is the most undemocratic and sinister move imaginable and is dictatorial in the extreme. MPs must be allowed to debate a decision like Brexit, which has split the country and continues to do so. Maybe MPs will now all get their act together and stop this.\u201d Evening everyone. This just in from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: The Guardian\u2019s Libby Brooks has been placing the Ruth Davidson exit as Scottish Tory leader into context. Davidson was reportedly livid at Boris Johnson\u2019s sacking of David Mundell as Scottish secretary and went on to issue a defiant challenge to Johnson on the eve of his first visit to Scotland as prime minister, pledging she would refuse to back a no-deal Brexit. In her regular column for the Scottish Mail on Sunday she promised she would \u201cnot be backward in challenging Mr Johnson\u2019s government where I think they are getting it wrong\u201d. The first openly lesbian party leader anywhere in the UK, Davidson gave birth last October to her first child, conceived with her partner, Jen, following IVF treatment. A state-educated woman with a working-class background in a party overwhelmingly controlled by privately schooled men, Davidson delivered previously unthinkable electoral success for the Scottish Tories at both Holyrood and Westminster. Last September Davidson published her first book, Yes She Can, a collection of interviews with \u201cmould-breaking women\u201d, in which she revealed she had been diagnosed with clinical depression as a teenager, and she discussed the ongoing management of her mental health. Davidson attracted criticism from opposition politicians including Nicola Sturgeon today for not giving media interviews after the prorogation announcement. Davidson\u2019s allies would not be drawn to speak publicly before her statement tomorrow and privately only expressed admiration for her leadership and sadness at her decision. The Scottish Labour Leader, Richard Leonard, has given his reaction to news of Ruth Davidson\u2019s departure as leader of the Scottish Tories. \u201cIf the rumours are true then the loss of Ruth Davidson as leader of the Scottish Conservatives will be a real blow to her party,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shows that even within his own ranks, Boris Johnson is already losing support and credibility. Scotland and the UK needs a general election as quickly as possible to oust him from Downing Street and elect a Labour government.\u201d Things are moving in Wales, where the assembly is being recalled from its Summer recess, reports Ian Craig of the South Wales Argus. European politicians have been casting an eye over events in Britain today, with a former French Europe minister talking about an \u201cillness\u201d at the heart of British democracy. The former minister, Nathalie Loiseau, now an MEP, said: \u201cWe are going to see a Brexit without agreement and what\u2019s more a Brexit without debate. What illness is British democracy suffering from to be fearful of debate before making one of the most important decisions in its history?\u201d A former Finnish prime minister, Alexander Stubb, said: \u201cIt makes me really sad to see what Brexit is doing to one of the great democracies of our time. Please, stay calm and use common sense.\u201d The Labour MP Jess Phillips has responded to Boris Johnson\u2019s letter to MPs about plans to prorogue parliament, telling him: \u201cThis is not the actions [sic] of a credible prime minister.\u201d She wrote: \u201cYou\u2019re gambling that the trappings of office will give you an advantage in this game of chance. It is a mighty gamble. And for the people I represent, it is not a game.\u201d She condemned the prime minister for treating her constituents\u2019 jobs, businesses and safety as \u201ccasino chips\u201d, and said \u201cevery right-minded member in parliament\u201d would fight his plan \u201cevery step of the way\u201d. \u201cThe sight of politicians from across the political divide working together this week to stop a no-deal Brexit has sent you into a panic,\u201d her letter to Johnson continues. \u201cThis is not the actions of a credible prime minister, you will lose and take the people down with you.\u201d Responding to reports that Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson is set to quit after differences with Boris Johnson, the Scottish Labour MP Ian Murray said her departure would be deeply felt by her party. \u201cShe campaigned tirelessly for a remain vote in the EU referendum, but the Tories under Boris Johnson have become a hard Brexit party, so it is not surprising that it has come to this,\u201d he said. Protesters have been gathering in Manchester\u2019s Albert Square, many armed with umbrellas \u2013 some in solidarity with Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protest and some simply to protect against the rain. They are chanting \u201cstop the coup\u201d, and holding signs reading \u201cHands off\u201d and \u201cProtect our democracy\u201d. One of the organisers, Emma, a 26-year-old immigration consultant, said: \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m angry and shocked that our democracy could be ripped out from underneath us while we\u2018re asleep at the wheel.\u201d She said she and her friend Noora had previously said they should be doing something, and today they said \u201cwe don\u2019t care if anyone else shows up, we\u2019re heading down to Manchester town centre. We tweeted about it and everyone got onboard.\u201d Noora, 27, a standup comedian, said they were inspired by the umbrella movement of Hong Kong. \u201cWe\u2019re here to protest against the downgrading of democracy that is happening in the UK at the moment \u2026 I feel like we should make some kind of a stand. It might seem minor but you\u2019re showing that it can\u2019t continue like this.\u201d They were joined by Rory and Margaret, retired lecturers in their 70s. Rory said: \u201cIt\u2019s the most flagrant attack on democracy that I can remember. It\u2019s bad enough that [Boris Johnson] was elected leader by a handful of people, but what was this \u2018taking back control\u2019 all about? And sovereignty of parliament? Parliament has just been overruled. I think it\u2019s an absolute outrage.\u201d Tallulah, 17, said she thought what was going on was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d. \u201cThe facade of a democracy is being ripped apart.\u201d William, 18, agreed with her. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd. I thought it was a joke the first time I saw it the article about the Queen. But unfortunately it\u2019s not satire. And here we are.\u201d Ruth Davidson is expected to quit as leader of the Scottish Conservative party because of her irreconcilable differences with Boris Johnson over Brexit and the pressures of motherhood. Scottish Tory sources said an announcement was imminent. Davidson was \u201cconsidering her position\u201d, one source said, although he stressed it was not connected to Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. Davidson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cRuth will make her decision clear in due course and there will be no further comment this evening.\u201d Davidson made abundantly clear during the Tory leadership campaign that she did not believe Johnson was the right man for the job. One of Johnson\u2019s first acts as prime minister was to sack her close friend and ally David Mundell, who served as Scottish secretary for five years. Severin Carrell, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, has confirmed reports that Ruth Davidson is on the verge of quitting, in part over her differences with Boris Johnson. He tweets: The former chancellor Philip Hammond has said MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit will \u201chave to do something\u201d when parliament returns next week. Some colleagues \u201cto be perfectly frank\u201d had been planning to wait but the circumstances had now changed and they would have to move in the coming days, he told broadcasters. Asked if it would involve trying to bring the government down, he replied: \u201cI have always made clear that I am not interested in bringing down the government. I simply want the government to recognise that the majority is opposed to a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Ruth Davidson is to quit as leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, according to a report in the Scottish Sun. Quoting \u201cinsiders\u201d, it says she is stepping down \u201cdue to the pressures of motherhood\u201d. Davidson became the first UK party leader to have a baby while in office when she gave birth to a boy at Edinburgh Royal infirmary last October. We\u2019d like to hear from people who are taking to the streets to protest against the prorogation of parliament. Tell us where you are and why you are taking part. Protests continue to be organised in towns and cities around the country. Here are the details of some: London Parliament Square, from 5pm Birmingham Victoria Square, 5.30pm Liverpool St George\u2019s Plateau, 5.30pm Milton Keynes Station, 6pm Chester Town Hall, 7pm Manchester Albert Square, from 4pm Edinburgh The Mound, from 4pm (moving to Holyrood at 4.30pm) Cambridge Market Square, from 6pm Cardiff Aneurin Bevan Statue, from 6pm Durham Marketplace, from 6pm Bristol College Green, 5.30pm Brighton Bartholomew Square. 5.30pm Jeremy Corbyn has responded to Donald Trump on Twitter. Lawyers seeking to reverse Boris Johnson\u2019s move to prorogue parliament hope a Scottish court will also hold a far faster hearing on whether the measure is unconstitutional and illegal. A legal team acting for Joanna Cherry and 74 other MPs and peers expect to be in court in Edinburgh this Friday morning to urge Scotland\u2019s civil court, the court of session, to block the proroguing agreed today by the Queen. They had already won approval for a full hearing of their legal challenge to Johnson\u2019s proroguing strategy on Friday 6 September next week. They will now ask the court to hear that case early next week, following Johnson\u2019s gambit on Wednesday. Jolyon Maugham QC, the anti-Brexit lawyer who helped coordinate the legal challenge through his Good Law Project, said they believe the courts are able to reverse the decision even though it has been approved by the Queen: The MPs\u2019 lawyer, Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, is expected to attack Johnson and the privy council\u2019s request of the Queen on Wednesday rather than the Queen\u2019s decision to approve it. O\u2019Neill will argue the court can order UK ministers to request that the Queen reverses the prorogument, again via the privy council. Either side is likely to immediately appeal against the judge\u2019s decision whichever way it goes, leading to series of urgent court hearings likely to end up at the UK supreme court. Meanwhile, the European Movement in Scotland held a demonstration against Johnson\u2019s \u201ccoup\u201d in central Edinburgh on Wednesday. We\u2019ve just launched a piece by Jessica Elgot providing answers to some of the key questions around the complex events of today. You can read it in full, but here are two: What is prorogation? Prorogation is a formal mechanism to end a session of parliament, normally lasting only a short time until proceedings begin again with a new Queen\u2019s speech. It means parliament\u2019s sitting is suspended and it ends all current legislation under discussion. It is normal for this to happen every autumn. The current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years. Can MPs vote against prorogation? No. Parliament is due to go on a three-week conference recess anyway in the second week of September and there had been suggestions MPs would vote against holding this recess, or any attempt to extend it. However, proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in this way. Jacob Rees-Mogg has been doorstepped at Aberdeen airport where journalists followed him through the terminal after his privy council meeting with the Queen. \u201cAnything the Queen says is private, as you know,\u201d said Rees-Mogg, who was one of three members of the council who went to Balmoral to ask permission on behalf of the prime minister for the prorogation of parliament. Asked if he was confident that the move would not be up for challenge in the courts, he replied: \u201cThe courts will come to their decision but this is a completely normal procedure.\u201d Some non-prorogation news now. Our political correspondent Kate Proctor reports that there is speculation that the Liberal Democrats are preparing to welcome another defector, after their former leader Vince Cable announced he would stand down as an MP at the next election. The candidate for Cable\u2019s Twickenham seat, which he won back from the Conservatives in the 2017 general election, will be chosen from an all-female shortlist. Those wanting to stand have until midday on Friday to say so. A spokesman for the party said: Vince has enjoyed a fantastic parliamentary career in the Liberal Democrats and representing the people of Twickenham. He will continue to serve as the MP until the next election, whenever that may be. The vacancy opens up the possibility that the rumoured defection of another former Change UK MP will soon follow, with new members to be announced at the party\u2019s autumn conference in Bournemouth. Senior party figures have said they are holding out for Heidi Allen, Luciana Berger or Angela Smith to make the switch and follow their former colleague Sarah Wollaston. A source said: \u201cTwickenham coming into play has certainly raised the levels of speculation about defections.\u201d Berger said she was still deciding what to do at the next election. The former MP Sarah Olney, who briefly took the Richmond Park seat from Zac Goldsmith before losing it months later in 2017, was briefly rumoured for Twickenham but has been reselected as the candidate in Richmond. The all-women shortlist quashes rumours that the former Labour MP and now Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, could switch from running in Streatham to Twickenham, where Cable had a 9,000 majority. Our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll has been listening to the Irish deputy PM, Simon Coveney, and the UK\u2019s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, speaking at a conference in Paris. The former prime minister John Major has said he is seeking legal advice on whether he can challenge Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. In a statement read out on BBC News, Major said: \u201cI have no doubt that the prime minister\u2019s motive in seeking prorogation is to bypass a sovereign parliament that opposes his policy. As events unfold I will continue to seek advice on the legality of this and other matters, but will be making no further comment.\u201d Last month Major said he would be willing to go to court to seek a judicial review to stop Johnson proroguing parliament. In June he said this: Planned protests against the prorogation of parliament are springing up around the country. The campaign group Another Europe is Possible is planning a demo on College Green in Westminster at 5.30pm. Leeds for Europe is planning a protest in City Square on Thursday at 5.30pm. In Manchester, people will start to gather (with umbrellas, Hong Kong-style) in Albert Square from 4pm today. The European Movement in Scotland is to host a walking vigil, meeting at 4pm at the foot of the Mound in Edinburgh. In Cardiff, people will gather at the Aneurin Bevan statue at 6pm today, and in Cambridge there will be a protest in Market Square. This tweet sent in June by Matt Hancock, now the health secretary, has been doing the rounds. In it he called on other Conservative leadership candidates to rule out proroguing parliament, saying it undermined parliamentary democracy. He doesn\u2019t appear to have said anything yet about today\u2019s announcement. Nicola Sturgeon hopes the Brexit crisis will boost the Scottish National party\u2019s chances of a shock Holyrood byelection victory in the Liberal Democrat stronghold of Shetland tomorrow. Pundits believe the SNP is on the verge of winning the seat, which the Lib Dems have held comfortably since the first Scottish parliament elections in 1999. Tavish Scott, previously a Scottish Lib Dems leader, won in 2016 with 67% of the vote, a majority of 4,865 over the SNP. The contiguous Westminster seat of Orkney and Shetland has been a Lib Dem constituency since 1950 and is the party\u2019s safest in the UK, but Sturgeon and the SNP have shovelled huge resources into the contest to succeed Scott, who stood down in June to work instead for Scottish Rugby. An SNP win tomorrow would be cited as clear proof that Scottish voters now favour independence from the rest of the UK after Brexit. Shetland historically has been sceptical about the case for leaving the UK. Sturgeon has visited Shetland to campaign three times in recent weeks, alongside numerous Holyrood ministers and SNP MPs and MSPs, inviting criticism from her opponents after one visit meant she failed to appear at a government press event disclosing a multibillion-pound public spending deficit in Scotland last year. The Scottish Tories pointed out Sturgeon had visited Shetland as many times in the last month as she had during her previous five years as first minister. Brydon Goodland, the Tory candidate for Shetland, said: \u201cThe SNP only care about Shetland when there are votes to be won.\u201d The final message to voters from Tom Wills, the SNP\u2019s young candidate, was Brexit-focused. He claimed the SNP was \u201cby some distance the strongest pro-European party in the UK\u201d with 100 parliamentarians at Scottish, UK and European level focused on stopping the UK leaving the EU. The Lib Dems reject the implication they are softer on Brexit. After all, their European election campaign slogan was \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d. But observers on Shetland say the Lib Dem campaign has suffered greatly from the lacklustre performance of its candidate, Beatrice Wishart , while Wills has energised younger voters. Much hinges on turnout. The Lib Dems hope the island\u2019s broadly conservative voters will treat with cynicism Wills\u2019s claims that the SNP will slash ferry and air fares for islanders, increase housing spending and protect fishing interests. Here\u2019s the document with the orders approved at today\u2019s meeting of the privy council at Balmoral. Anna Soubry has become the latest MP to write to the Queen today to ask for a meeting ... Here is the document with the orders approved at the privy council at Balmoral today. And this is the key text: It is this day ordered by Her Majesty in Council that the Parliament be prorogued on a day no earlier than Monday the 9th day of September and no later than Thursday the 12th day of September 2019 to Monday the 14th day of October 2019, to be then holden for the despatch of divers urgent and important affairs, and that the Right Honourable the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain do cause a Commission to be prepared and issued in the usual manner for proroguing the Parliament accordingly. The privy council meeting to sign off Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to suspend parliament has taken place at Balmoral, the Press Association reports. Sources said the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the lord president of the council, plus the Lords leader, Natalie Evans, and the chief whip, Mark Spencer, attended the meeting with the Queen. The former Tory deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine has just put out a statement after hearing about the news of what\u2019s happening in the UK while on holiday in the Balkans. Like a range of others, he says it\u2019s a constitutional outrage. \u201cOn hearing the news whilst on holiday in Montenegro, I am appalled by the government\u2019s announcement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government\u2019s decision is a constitutional outrage. A government which is frightened of parliament is frightened of democracy. I hope that every member of parliament, in feeling this humiliation, will use every legal and constitutional weapon to obstruct a government proposing to force on the British people a historic change for which they have long since lost any mandate.\u201d My colleagues Lisa O\u2019Carroll and Heather Stewart report that constitutional experts are saying the prime minister\u2019s plan to prorogue parliament for five weeks will be the longest suspension of the British legislature since 1945. They said it appeared to be designed to evade scrutiny of his plans for Brexit or any new deal with the EU. Ruth Fox, the director of the highly respected Hansard Society, a leading source of independent research and advice on parliamentary affairs, said it was an \u201caffront to parliamentary democracy\u201d. Lawyers said the unprecedented length of the suspension of parliament would prompt immediate legal challenge. \u201cExpect litigation \u2013 starting in Scotland,\u201d said Ros Kellaway, the head of Brexit and EU law at Eversheds Sutherland, in London. Read the full story here: The US president has helpfully tweeted to say it will be very hard for Jeremy Corbyn to \u201cseek a no-confidence vote against the new prime minister Boris Johnson\u201d. He added: \u201cBoris is exactly what the UK has been looking for and will prove to be \u2018a great one!\u2019 Love UK.\u201d The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has written to the Queen to ask for a meeting in light of the prime minister \u201cstifling the voices of both the people and their representatives\u201d. Further to this post about the geographical spread of the signatories on the petition against the proroguing of parliament, this nifty tool allows you to check how many people in your constituency have signed it. 1,627 people in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s constituency have signed it so far, compared with 199 in Boris Johnson\u2019s seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. (The petition has nearly 287,000 signatures now, by the way.) The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has accused the French government of risking leaving British people resident in the country behind after Brexit, writes Lisa O\u2019Carroll. Speaking at a conference in Paris organised by the French business group Medef, Barclay said Brits in France would be left with fewer rights than those of the 300,000 French nationals in the UK in the event of no deal. EU leaders repeatedly tell me how important citizens\u2019 rights are to them but not only has the [European] commission refused to agree a specific deal on citizens\u2019 rights \u2013 as requested by all political parties in the UK parliament \u2013 the offer here in France falls short of what we have set out in the UK in several respects. We have guaranteed the rights of the approximately 300,000 French nationals and indeed all EU nationals living in the UK. I call on the French government and others in the EU to match our offer and provide certainty for UK nationals in France. The value of the pound fell sharply against the euro and the dollar this morning after Boris Johnson announced plans to suspend parliament, raising the chances of a no-deal exit from the EU. Sterling fell by more than a cent against the US dollar to a six-day low of below $1.22, and by almost as much against the euro, to \u20ac1.096. Here\u2019s our story: The Sun\u2019s political editor is reporting some \u201cserious disquiet\u201d in government about Boris Johnson\u2019s new strategy. This is a great explainer by Jessica Elgot on what exactly prorogation is and why the prime minister is using it. The Press Association is reporting that a group of Church of England bishops has issued an open letter outlining their particular concerns over the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Twenty-five bishops signed the letter warning of the potential cost of a no-deal Brexit to \u201cthose least resilient to economic shocks\u201d. \u201cThe sovereignty of parliament is not just an empty term, it is based on institutions to be honoured and respected: our democracy is endangered by cavalier disregard for these,\u201d they said. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said on Tuesday he would be willing to chair a citizens\u2019 forum on Brexit \u201cin principle\u201d after being approached by senior MPs. \u201cThe archbishop of Canterbury has conditionally agreed to chair a citizens forum in Coventry and, without prejudice for any particular outcome, we support this move to have all voices in the current Brexit debate heard,\u201d said the bishops. \u201cHowever, we also have particular concerns about the potential cost of a no-deal Brexit to those least resilient to economic shocks.\u201d Boris Johnson has placed the Queen \u201cin the firing line\u201d over Brexit, according to the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic. It floated the possibility that a parliamentary crisis could become a royal crisis. Republic\u2019s spokesman, Graham Smith, said Johnson had thrown British politics into a deep crisis \u201cand has shone a spotlight on the impotence of the Queen and the role of the monarch\u2019s powers\u201d. \u201cAlready people are petitioning the Queen to intervene, but she won\u2019t. Not because she can\u2019t, but because the Queen\u2019s first priority is always the preservation of the monarchy. \u201cBut Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament has created a unique crisis for the Queen. The convention is that the Queen does as she\u2019s told by the PM. But in normal times the PM has the full support of a majority in the Commons.\u201d \u201cConstitutionally the Queen is free to decide whether or not to go along with the government\u2019s plans or support the sovereign parliament. So the Queen has a choice to make, and she\u2019s damned if she does and damned if she doesn\u2019t.\u201d Smith added: \u201cWill the public care about the constitutional niceties? How much the Queen fulfils the public\u2019s expectations and hopes will determine how much the parliamentary crisis becomes a royal crisis.\u201d For the record, a YouGov poll in the run-up to last year\u2019s royal marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle found that seven in 10 Britons support Britain continuing to have a monarchy. Monarchists were also slightly more likely to be leave voters, with those who cast a ballot in 2016 splitting 56/44% in favour of Brexit. Those who were against Britain having a royal family voted 65/35% in favour of remain. The shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, has told BBC Radio 5 Live that \u201copposition parties will be more united\u201d as a result of Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament. She described the move as \u201cunconstitutional and unlawful\u201d and said she had \u201clittle doubt that the courts will step up to protect our parliament and parliamentary democracy\u201d. They think they can get away with shutting down parliament because it\u2019s inconvenient, and that is unconstitutional and unlawful in our country \u2026 None of us voted for a prime minister to shut down parliament because it\u2019s annoying. Chakrabarti said the first step would be to mount a parliamentary challenge, before considering legal action. We will work across parties to defeat this strategy in parliament. And I hope it doesn\u2019t come to it, but if down the road it ends up in the courts, I have little doubt that the courts will step up to protect our parliament and parliamentary democracy. She also said of Boris Johnson: He\u2019s been getting away with blue murder, but this time he\u2019s gone too far. That petition is now at 175,000 signatures. It had 14,000 just over two hours ago. Once a petition gets more than 100,000 signatures it must be considered for a debate in parliament. You can see where in the country the signatories come from by looking at this heatmap. It\u2019s interesting to see the dark red patches in places such as London, Brighton, Oxford and Cambridge, as well as the more affluent parts of big northern cities such as Manchester and Sheffield. Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour will do everything it can to prevent what he described as a \u201csmash and grab\u201d operation on the part of the government. \u201cI have protested in the strongest possible terms on behalf of my party and all the other opposition parties that are going to join in with this in saying that suspending parliament is not acceptable, It\u2019s not on,\u201d the Labour leader said in a clip pooled to broadcasters. \u201cWhat the prime minister is doing is a sort of smash and grab on our democracy in order to force through a no-deal exit from the European Union. What is he so afraid of that he has to suspend parliament in order to prevent parliament discussing these matters? Corbyn said the first thing Labour would do was to put forward legislation to prevent the suspension, and than there would be a challenge in the form of a vote of no confidence. Asked about plans by a cross-party group of MPs to hold an alternative parliament, and calls by some Labour MPs for people to take to the streets, he replied: \u201cWe will do everything that we can. We will join everybody else in doing that.\u201d Mick Whelan, the general secretary of the train drivers\u2019 trade union, Aslef, has said Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to \u201ctry to sideline parliament in the run-up to Brexit\u201d could cause civil unrest. Whatever your views on Brexit, the democratic process must underpin what is done in all our names \u2013 or civil unrest will be the result. It is disturbing that a prime minister who only has a mandate from the Conservative party and not from the electorate is trying to undermine the foundations of our democracy. And while people did vote, three years ago, to leave the European Union, no one voted to leave without a deal. The best way forward is to call a general election and let the people decide. The political commentator Paul Mason has called on people to gather in central London tonight to protest against the government\u2019s planned suspension of parliament. The Guardian\u2019s chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot, has a useful caveat here on how much parliamentary time will be lost through the prorogation. In practice, MPs are only likely to lose between four and six sitting days in parliament, depending on which day parliament is prorogued in the second week of September. MPs would have been due to hold conference recess from 12 September until 7 October. Given that MPs do not generally sit on Fridays, it means MPs will not be able to sit for four days until the following Monday, 14 October. They could also lose days in the second week of September, depending on what day parliament is prorogued in the week beginning 9 September. However, one key new obstacle is that any legislation that is incomplete ahead of prorogation will fall, meaning MPs would have to pass any anti-no-deal legislation in its entirety either before prorogation or in the three weeks leading up to 31 October. Jeremy Corbyn has written to the Queen expressing concern about the move by Boris Johnson, reports our colleague Heather Stewart. The Labour MP Clive Lewis has said the police will have to remove him and other MPs from the chamber of the House of Commons if parliament is shut down. Charlie Falconer, the Labour peer and former lord chancellor, has also been tweeting: Events in Britain are making headlines around Europe and elsewhere. Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds reports that Boris Johnson is demonstrating a determination and recklessness that his main critics never anticipated. Britain is now heading towards an \u201cunprecedented constitutional shock\u201d in which the Queen will be involuntarily involved, adds the Spanish daily, which is considered a national newspaper of record in a country that is itself no stranger to constitutional crises and worse. In France, Le Monde leads with a straight news report on events in the UK, noting that the pound fell against the euro and adding that Johnson is \u201cdesperate to leave the EU\u201d with or without a divorce agreement. In the US, the New York Times described Johnson\u2019s request for the suspension of parliament as \u201ca surprise maneuver that would make it harder for lawmakers to prevent Britain from exiting the European Union without an agreement with the bloc.\u201d In Ireland, Pat Leahy, the Irish Times political editor, predicts that Johnson\u2019s move \u201cwill almost certainly incite a parliamentary rebellion that his government is likely to lose\u201d. He added: \u201cIn Dublin and in Brussels, they will sit tight and watch. This fight is in Westminster, and then, probably, across the UK. In truth, it has been coming for months. Only once it is resolved will the Brexit deal-making resume, as all the while the no-deal clock ticks louder and louder.\u201d Guy Verhofstadt, the chief Brexit representative for the European parliament, has tweeted that \u201ctaking back control\u201d has never looked so sinister. \u201cAs a fellow parliamentarian, my solidarity with those fighting for their voices to be heard,\u201d he said. Joanna Cherry, an SNP MP and part of a group behind a legal action in Edinburgh aimed at preventing Boris Johnson from shutting down parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit, has said opposition parties may now have to review plans agreed yesterday to go for primary legislation first rather than a vote of no confidence. As reported this morning by the Guardian\u2019s Libby Brooks, the barrister told the BBC that she had made a motion this morning to the court in Edinburgh to try to get the hearing brought forward. The court will rule on whether it is lawful for parliament to be suspended. Cherry described the move today by Boris Johnson as \u201cprofoundly undemocratic\u201d. \u201cThe good news is that the opposition is more united than it has ever been and we are looking at all options to prevent Boris Johnson from acting like a dictator,\u201d she said. The preference of those parties had been to go first with primary legislation \u2013 of the type that would, for example, extend article 50 - but that should now be reviewed, she said. However, Cherry cautioned that a vote of no confidence could still be used as \u201ca ruse\u201d by Boris Johnson to call a general election after the planned departure date of 31 October and thereby facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Cherry echoed some of the language of her party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, in voicing concern that the prime minister could also shut down the Scottish parliament \u201cif he closes Westminster on a whim\u201d. Some Conservative MPs here tweeting in support of the government\u2019s decision, all trying to suggest that proroguing parliament is a very normal thing to do. The Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan has accused those describing the government\u2019s move as a coup of having \u201ca screwed-up mindset\u201d. Nick Boles, who resigned the Tory party whip in April citing the party\u2019s failure to compromise on Brexit, has said any MP who supports the government\u2019s move to suspend parliament will \u201cshare in responsibility for the damage inflicted by a no-deal Brexit on 31 October\u201d. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has compared the actions of Downing Street today to those of a dictatorship. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely outrageous. Shutting down parliament in order to force through a no-deal Brexit which will do untold and lasting damage to the country against the wishes of MPs is not democracy. It\u2019s a dictatorship and if MPs don\u2019t come together next week to stop Boris Johnson in his tracks then I think today will go down in history as the day UK democracy died,\u201d she told the BBC. Speaking in Edinburgh, the SNP leader said she had listened to Boris Johnson in the morning and rarely had she heard a more flimsy \u201ccover story\u201d. \u201cEverybody knows what this is about. It\u2019s about restricting the power parliament has to stop a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Noting that Johnson was unelected and had come to power after being selected by Tory MPs, Sturgeon said enacting new laws or anything that could stop Johnson had to be a priority. There was now a narrow window of opportunity to act on a plan that opposition parties had discussed yesterday, she said, to try to take control of business in the House of Commons and pass primary legislation. Unison\u2019s general secretary, Dave Prentis, has accused Boris Johnson of treating the future of the UK \u201clike the plot of a far-fetched political TV drama\u201d. This outrageous manoeuvre has been made to silence all opposition in the most dictatorial way. Our parliamentary democracy is the envy of the world, but it\u2019s being stamped upon and disregarded by a prime minister who\u2019s not gone near a public vote. Boris Johnson is treating the future of the UK like the plot of a far-fetched political TV drama. The country must be asked for its view on Brexit right now. That\u2019s the only way. Here\u2019s a roundup of more Twitter reaction. The Conservative MP and Johnson ally Zac Goldsmith was predictably dismissive of the idea that proroguing parliament was a constitutional outrage. Alastair Campbell, the No 10 director of communications under Tony Blair, called on Conservative MPs to get behind a legislative plan to stop a no-deal Brexit. In the north-east, which is expected to be particularly hard hit by a no-deal Brexit, the mayor of the North of Tyne, Jamie Driscoll, called for a march on Downing Street. He said: People voted to give Britain parliamentary sovereignty. By a small margin we voted to leave the EU, and the likes of Johnson and Farage were talking about Norway- or Swiss-style arrangements. Now we are seeing this farce, this dangerous destruction of our democracy. Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to derail democracy by proroguing parliament has all the trappings of a coup. People need to march on Downing Street. Our parents and grandparents did not fight dictators to see it happen here. That petition I mentioned earlier now has 65,000 signatures, up from 14,000 just under an hour ago. The DUP, which props up the Conservative government, has supported the decision to prorogue parliament. The party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, said on Twitter that it had been the longest parliamentary session in the Union of England and Scotland since 1707. She said the terms of the party\u2019s confidence and supply agreement with the government would be reviewed in advance of the new session. \u201cThis will be an opportunity to ensure our priorities align with those of the government,\u201d said Foster. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has issued a statement responding to the government\u2019s announcement. I am appalled at the recklessness of Johnson\u2019s government, which talks about sovereignty and yet is seeking to suspend parliament to avoid scrutiny of its plans for a reckless no-deal Brexit. This is an outrage and a threat to our democracy. That is why Labour has been working across parliament to hold this reckless government to account, and prevent a disastrous no deal, which parliament has already ruled out. If Johnson has confidence in his plans he should put them to the people in a general election or public vote. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, described the developments as \u201ca very British coup\u201d. He tweeted: \u201cWhatever one\u2019s views on Brexit, once you allow a prime minister to prevent the full and free operation of our democratic institutions you are on a very precarious path.\u201d Dr Catherine Haddon, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, spoke to BBC news earlier. (I\u2019ve only just had a chance to write up my notes.) We were due to have a Queen\u2019s speech and prorogation anyway but to do it right now, given everything that is going on and given the emphasis that is going to be on parliament in the effort by some MPs to try and stop a no-deal Brexit, it does seem like a very obvious move to try and cut down the time available to anti-no deal MPs to be able to do something about it. She said we could expect a showdown between the government and MPs next week. We heard in the last week or so a lot of noises about whether or not Boris Johnson would be able to find a deal, [whether he] was making progress possibly with EU leaders about when he might be able to do that, and there was some speculation that that might stop Conservative MPs wanting to go to a showdown with their own government too early and that they would actually give the government time. I think this changes that. The first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, has renewed his calls for a second EU referendum in response to today\u2019s prorogation news. This is a good quick backgrounder from the House of Commons library on how exactly proroguing parliament works. A petition calling on the government not to prorogue parliament has already received more than 14,000 signatures. Its text reads: \u201cParliament must not be prorogued or dissolved unless and until the article 50 period has been sufficiently extended or the UK\u2019s intention to withdraw from the EU has been cancelled.\u201d The Financial Times\u2019s Sebastian Payne is reporting that the government will call an election if MPs manage to pass a vote of no confidence next week. The SNP MP Joanna Cheery has confirmed that she has spoken to her legal team about speeding up the action in the Scottish courts to stop Boris Johnson shutting down parliament, which was due to be heard of 6 September. Ian Murray, another of the cross-party group of more than 70 MPs and peers behind the action, said they would consider seeking an interim interdict (similar to an injunction in England and Wales) in the court of session to block prorogation. Led by Jolyon Maugham QC\u2019s Good Law Project, the group had been seeking a ruling from the court of session to prevent the prime minister going to the Queen with a request for prorogation until all appeals were exhausted. Cherry told reporters on Tuesday the team were prepared to get a judge \u201cout of their bed in the middle of the night\u201d to block prorogation. Meanwhile, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has described Johnson as a \u201cdictator\u201d, saying: \u201cThe Tory leader has no mandate, no majority and is acting like a dictator by attempting to curtail parliament to get his way. \u201cThe SNP will do everything we can to stop Brexit and prevent a no-deal disaster. It is vital that MPs from across the parties urgently pull together to stop Boris Johnson driving Scotland and the UK off a cliff edge.\u201d The Speaker, John Bercow, has issued an extraordinary statement. \u201cI have had no contact from the government, but if the reports that it is seeking to prorogue parliament are confirmed, this move represents a constitutional outrage,\u201d he says. Here\u2019s the full text of the prime minister\u2019s letter to MPs. The former chancellor Philip Hammond has said it would be \u201ca constitutional outrage\u201d if parliament were prevented from holding the government to account. Hammond quit the cabinet before Boris Johnson became prime minister and has become a leading opponent of no-deal Brexit. Downing Street has sent through its formal announcement. Here are the key points. Boris Johnson has briefed cabinet colleagues that the government will \u201cbring forward an ambitious new legislative programme for MPs\u2019 approval\u201d, and that the current parliamentary session will be brought to an end. He has spoken to the Queen to request an end to the current parliamentary session in the second sitting week in September. Following the conclusion of the traditional party conference season, the second session of this parliament will commence with a Queen\u2019s speech on Monday 14 October. \u201cA central feature of the legislative programme will be the government\u2019s number one legislative priority \u2013 if a new deal is forthcoming at European council \u2013 to introduce a withdrawal agreement bill and move at pace to secure its passage before 31 October.\u201d \u201cThe decision to end the current parliamentary session \u2013 the longest in close to 400 years and in recent months one of the least active \u2013 will enable the prime minister to put a fresh domestic programme in front of MPs for debate and scrutiny while also ensuring that there is good time before and after the European council for Parliament to further consider Brexit issues.\u201d Votes on the Queen\u2019s speech are likely to fall on Monday 21 and Tuesday 22 October. And here\u2019s a statement from the prime minister: We must focus on crucial public priorities \u2013 helping the NHS, fighting violent crime, investing in infrastructure and science and cutting the cost of living. We have made an important start \u2013 funding for 20,000 extra police officers and new investment in our NHS \u2013 but to deliver on the public\u2019s priorities we require a new session and a Queen\u2019s speech. I believe it is vital that parliament is sitting both before and after European council and if, as I hope, a deal with the EU is forthcoming, parliament will then have the opportunity to pass the withdrawal agreement bill required for ratification ahead of 31 October. Here is Boris Johnson\u2019s letter to MPs confirming that parliament will be prorogued. It starts: \u201cI hope you had an enjoyable and productive summer recess, with the opportunity for some rest ahead of the return of the house.\u201d He says he will request an end to the parliamentary session in the second sitting week of September. Boris Johnson has been speaking to the broadcast media. He confirmed that the Queen\u2019s speech would be held on 14 October and said the move to suspend parliament was purely about \u201cgetting on with plans to take this country forward\u201d. As I said on the steps of Downing Street, we\u2019re not going to wait until 31 October before getting on with our plans to take this country forward. This is a new government with a very exciting agenda ... We have to be bringing forward new and important bills. That\u2019s why we are going to have a Queen\u2019s speech and we are going to do it on 14 October. He denied that it was a move to deny MPs the time they needed to debate and vote on Brexit. That is completely untrue. If you look at what we\u2019re doing we are bringing forward a new legislative programme on crime, on hospitals, making sure that we have the education funding that we need and there will be ample time on both sides of that crucial 17 October summit, ample time in parliament for MPs to debate the EU to debate Brexit and all the other issues. Asked if he was planning a general election, he said: No, all you should take from this is that we are doing exactly what I said on the steps of Downing Street, which is we must get on now with our legislative domestic agenda. Scotland\u2019s first minister has tweeted, saying that unless MPs work together to stop Johnson, today could go down as \u201ca dark one indeed for UK democracy\u201d. She called on the Scottish Conservatives to back a cross-party effort to try to block the suspension of parliament. The Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent, Libby Brooks, has just pointed out that the SNP party conference will fall right across the date of the proposed Queen\u2019s speech. Craig Oliver, who was director of communications at No 10 under David Cameron, has tweeted: More reaction from outraged opposition MPs is coming in. Anna Soubry, the leader of Change UK, has said UK democracy is under threat from \u201ca ruthless PM\u201d. The Conservative rebel Dominic Grieve has been speaking to BBC News. The former attorney general, who opposes a no-deal Brexit, said he would consult with likeminded MPs over the next few days ahead of parliament\u2019s return next week. He said they would try to take steps to try to ensure that prorogation would not happen and suggested there could be a vote of no confidence in the government. I think that the prime minster\u2019s decision is deeply questionable and frankly pretty outrageous. He knows very well that we are in the middle of a national crisis. He knows very well that parliament is very concerned about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and this has very little to do with starting a new session of parliament. It is a deliberate attempt to make sure parliament doesn\u2019t sit for a five week perio \u2026 This is an attempt to govern without parliament. It is pretty unprecedented and I think the government will come to regret it. When opposition leaders met yesterday they stressed they would prioritise legislative measures to try to stop a no-deal Brexit, rather than holding a vote of no confidence in the government, but Grieve said a vote of confidence was now more likely. If it is impossible to prevent prorogation then i think it is going to be very difficult for people like myself to keep confidence in the government and I could well see why the leader of the opposition would wish to table a motion for a vote of no confidence \u2026 I\u2019ve always been of the view that bringing down the administration which is made up of a party of which I am a member is something I would only do as a last resort and that remains my position and I don\u2019t wish to do it f there is any way of avoiding it. But if there is no other way of avoiding it it may be the only thing I can do. The Observer\u2019s political editor, Toby Helm, tweets that his paper reported on Sunday that Boris Johnson had asked the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, whether parliament could be shut down for five weeks from 9 September. He said the report was rubbished by No 10. Best for Britain, a group committed to stopping Brexit \u201cthrough any democratic means\u201d, have issued a statement. The group\u2019s chief executive, Naomi Smith, said: It would make no sense for the Queen to back this deeply undemocratic, unconstitutional and fundamentally political manoeuvre from the government. If the Queen is asked to help, she would do well to remember history doesn\u2019t look too kindly on royals who aid and abet the suspension of democracy. John Redwood, the Conservative MP and arch-Eurosceptic, is going along with the \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d line. This is from Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper. She says the government\u2019s move is \u201cdeeply dangerous and irresponsible\u201d. This is from Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake. He says the \u201cdeclaration of war will be met with an iron fist\u201d. More from the Guardian\u2019s chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot. This from the chairman of the Conservative party, James Cleverly, demonstrates the line the government is going to take \u2013 that this move is business as usual. And here is our story. Ministers could move on Wednesday to suspend parliament for up to five weeks, which would prevent MPs from planning legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit, the Guardian understands. Senior sources said a privy council of senior ministers was preparing to meet the Queen at Balmoral this week, perhaps as soon as Wednesday to set this in motion. MPs have already started condemning the reported plans on Twitter. So, to recap, the BBC is reporting that the government is to ask the Queen to suspend parliament days after MPs return from recess. A Number 10 source told the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, that this would allow Boris Johnson\u2019s new administration to hold a Queen\u2019s Speech on 14 October. This will leave MPs with very little time to attempt to pass laws that could stop a no deal Brexit. Here is the BBC\u2019s story. And this from the BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg. More from our chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot, on reports that a recess until mid-October could be on the agenda of a privy council meeting this week. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian politics live blog. Following the surprise announcement yesterday afternoon that the first major speech by the chancellor, Sajid Javid \u2013 due to be held today \u2013 was to cancelled, the Treasury has confirmed that the one-year spending review, which had been due to take place later this year, would happen on 4 September, the day after MPs return to parliament. The announcement has added fuel to speculation the government could be planning an early general election. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Javid pledged increased spending on priority areas of schools, police and health, but said there would be no \u201cblank cheque\u201d for departments. Thanks to the hard work of the British people over the last decade, we can afford to spend more on the people\u2019s priorities, without breaking the rules around what the government should spend, and we\u2019ll do that in a few key areas like schools, hospitals and police. But at the same time, it\u2019s vital that we continue to live within our means as a country. Unlike the Labour party, we don\u2019t believe in just throwing money at a problem. And especially at a time when the global economy is slowing, it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t let our public finances get out of control. So I can confirm that next week\u2019s spending round will be delivered within the current fiscal rules. As every household knows, that will mean making choices and prioritising where we focus spending, and any departments expecting a blank cheque will be sorely disappointed. Jeremy Corbyn yesterday backed cross-party plans to delay a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson and prioritise rebel MPs\u2019 attempts to use legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. Plans are set to be agreed by the end of the week. The Guardian\u2019s political team reports that rumours at swirling at Westminster that the privy council of senior ministers is preparing to meet the Queen at Balmoral this week, perhaps as soon as today. They write: Leaked emails revealed at the weekend that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had sought legal advice about proroguing parliament for five weeks from early September, when MPs are already expected to break briefly for party conferences. A new session of parliament would then begin with a fresh Queen\u2019s speech packed with manifesto-friendly measures on or around 14 October. Such a move would have to be approved by the privy council. It would give MPs little chance for parliamentary manoeuvring, but could just about allow time for a vote on any reworked deal Johnson manages to strike with the EU27, before the crucial European council meeting on 17 October. Last night, the Guardian published details of a raft of dramatic and controversial education policy proposals set out in a confidential leaked briefing paper. The measures include billions of pounds in new funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools, which are set to be announced by the government within days. This morning, ministers have been accused of trying to act tough with reforms that would emphasise excluding unruly children from schools and using \u201creasonable force\u201d against them. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said: We know the role that school exclusions have played in the rise of knife crime, but once again the Tories are trying to sound tough whilst failing to look at the evidence. The Conservative government would rather kick kids out of school and advocate the use of the ambiguously termed \u2018reasonable force\u2019 as discipline, which will cause parents, children and teachers additional stress, rather than actually putting the time and investment in to ensure all children receive a good education and have a positive experience within our schools.

But now to be classed, if you\u2019re selected, as an Olympian is one of the greatest honours in sport and to have the opportunity to represent Great Britain and women\u2019s sport in Tokyo would be an amazing opportunity and help keep people watching women\u2019s football.\u201d</p> <p>With England hosting Euro 2021, they have no competitive fixtures before then.

So they can\u2019t waste a minute. I\u2019ve seen my players come back with incredible desire to do better. The hurt, the anger, they are going to use that as their fuel.\u201d</p> <p>Neville, having brought in Aoife Mannion, recalled the 170-cap Fara Williams and included the youngsters Sandy McIver and Anna Patten (with more young players also to get a chance in the next three camps), is preparing to fill the gaps in the squad made evident to him at the World Cup. \u201cWe\u2019re building now, a 23-player squad \u2013 18 for the Olympics \u2013 that I can trust to put on that field,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cTournament-ready footballers, it\u2019s really important.

So on reflection, looking at the Olympics and beyond that, we want to win, but going to the Olympics and getting on that podium has to be something that we look at.\u201d Neville still believes the extra game should not exist. \u201cI\u2019ve never liked third- or fourth-place games. It was 1990 and Italy were dancing on the stage after; it wasn\u2019t a final. I don\u2019t like the game and neither do my players \u2013 we\u2019ve spoken about it. We wanted to win gold. Should I have said \u2018nonsense\u2019? Probably not, but it was my feeling at the time.\u201d Neville\u2019s drive to instil a winning mentality has meant that, for his players, bronze would not have been good enough, and the goalkeeper Carly Telford is open about that. \u201cAs a collective we felt we were a failure,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Phil was quite open about that when he responded to the bronze\u2011medal match. \u201cI don\u2019t think he worded it correctly but I think he meant we came to win a gold medal and we didn\u2019t and therefore anything else wasn\u2019t going to be good enough. I think even if we had won bronze it wasn\u2019t better than what we had done previously.\u201d Nonetheless Telford thinks England have progressed since their third place at the 2015 World Cup. \u201cI\u2019d say arguably yes, we\u2019ve played a better style of football, we beat opposition that were good quite comfortably but when it came to those final margins and hurdles we weren\u2019t good enough.\u201d For Telford the Olympics is a different story, with a medal of any colour meaning more. \u201cAs a footballer you never really think of being an Olympian because it\u2019s not on our agenda or within our sport. But now to be classed, if you\u2019re selected, as an Olympian is one of the greatest honours in sport and to have the opportunity to represent Great Britain and women\u2019s sport in Tokyo would be an amazing opportunity and help keep people watching women\u2019s football.\u201d With England hosting Euro 2021, they have no competitive fixtures before then. The fight for an Olympic place, though, adds much needed competitiveness to the game here and the match next Tuesday in Norway. \u201cFor the Olympics I can only pick 18 players \u2013 and that\u2019s not 18 England players, that\u2019s 18 home nation players,\u201d Neville said. \u201cSo they know they are going to have to hit certain barometers, certain testing, certain levels, to actually make an 18-player squad. So they can\u2019t waste a minute. I\u2019ve seen my players come back with incredible desire to do better. The hurt, the anger, they are going to use that as their fuel.\u201d Neville, having brought in Aoife Mannion, recalled the 170-cap Fara Williams and included the youngsters Sandy McIver and Anna Patten (with more young players also to get a chance in the next three camps), is preparing to fill the gaps in the squad made evident to him at the World Cup. \u201cWe\u2019re building now, a 23-player squad \u2013 18 for the Olympics \u2013 that I can trust to put on that field,\u201d he said. \u201cTournament-ready footballers, it\u2019s really important. And I\u2019ve got to say those characters are the ones that ultimately are more important than ones with unbelievable ability, and that\u2019s ultimately the route we\u2019re going to go down. I pick characters, the durable players, the ones that when the going gets tough, they get up.\u201d",

Dzumhur looks well set to take his first game of the set but a double fault combined with a netted effort and it\u2019s Federer\u2019s advantage. Federer can\u2019t, however, secure the double break and Dzumhur takes the next three points. <strong>It\u2019s 3-6, 3-1 Federer.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d66c6178f082209d3223534\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T18:26:33.826Z\">7.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Federer, with that late momentum from the last game, sprints to 0-40 on Dzumhur\u2019s serve.

That could be one of the matches of the day on the women\u2019s side, where the French Open champion, Ashleigh Barty, the once world No 1 Karolina Pliskova and the in-form Cincinnati winner, Madison Keys, play too.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/27/us-open-tennis-kyle-edmund-pablo-andujar-stefanos-tsitsipas\">Kyle Edmund\u2019s grand slam season came to a disappointing end yesterday</a>, British hopes rest with Johanna Konta and Dan Evans. Konta was due to open on Grandstand in just over 10 minutes\u2019 time but unfortunately the weather isn\u2019t behaving and she\u2019ll be delayed by rain. When the British No 1 does get on she\u2019ll face her second consecutive Russian opponent in Margarita Gasparyan, while Evans, after scrapping and snarling his way past Adrian Mannarino in the first round, has another tricky French test against the world No 27, Lucas Pouille.</p> <p>Elsewhere we\u2019ll get another look at the man of the hard-court summer, Daniil Medvedev, the 2016 champion, Stan Wawrinka, the 2014 runner-up, Kei Nishikori, and what could be a tasty encounter between the talented Croatian Borna Coric and Grigor Dimitrov \u2013 as long as the old Grigor Dimitrov turns up. The new Grigor Dimitrov has had an awful year and hasn\u2019t managed to string more than two successive wins together since the Australian Open back in January.</p> <p><strong>Play was due to begin:</strong> at 11am New York time/4pm BST but it looks as if the only action we\u2019ll have is Nishikori against the American Bradley Klahn under the Louis Armstrong roof.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T14:52:23.909Z\">at 3.52pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s it for the day session I\u2019m afraid, with all matches on the outside courts cancelled for today. So Johanna Konta and Dan Evans will have to come back tomorrow, as will many others including Daniil Medvedev and Stan Wawrinka. Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Ashleigh Barty and the American beanpole Reilly Opelka will still get to play in the night session, which begins in just over an hour\u2019s time, but that\u2019s it from me. Thanks for reading, sorry there wasn\u2019t more to discuss. Do join me again tomorrow and we\u2019ll have reports on the late action. Bye! Keys rips a cross-court return winner on the forehand side \u2013 where else \u2013 to break Zhu and end the Chinese player\u2019s brief resistance. A 30th winner from Keys combined with a Zhu error and it\u2019s 40-15, two match points, and Keys takes the match with a stinging serve, her third ace of the day. She\u2019ll be delighted to get through in straight sets and become only the fifth player to win on this wet and near washed-out Wednesday. \u201cI love playing at my home slam and having an amazing crowd behind me,\u201d says the finalist of two years ago. \u201cI got lucky with the rain so it was a little bit more full. Thanks for coming out to cheer for me.\u201d I may have spoken too soon. Umbrellas are springing up again as Johanna Konta, having made her way on to Grandstand for a match that should have started six and a half hours ago, heads for cover in the locker room once more. So much for the US Open, this is more like Wimbledon. What a frustrating day. Except for Roger Federer, Kei Nishikori, Elina Svitolina and Karolina Pliskova, the only second-round winners so far. And to that list we can surely soon add Keys, who has dropped serve in the second set but still leads 6-4, 4-1. Inconsistency is often Keys\u2019s downfall but the American is looking extremely solid, and the second set appears to be going only one way as Keys charges to 3-0 courtesy of some fearsome forehand strikes. And finally some good news to bring you: despite the very gloomy skies the rain has stopped, the courts are being dried, some of the players are even warming up and we may have some play elsewhere soon. Keys shows her experience, stepping it up when it matters to seize the first set 6-4. Meanwhile here\u2019s the order of play for the main courts tomorrow, elsewhere it\u2019ll probably be chaos given the amount of catching up that\u2019ll be taking place: Arthur Ashe 12pm/5pm BST Zverev-Tiafoe Halep-Townsend 7pm/12am BST Wozniacki-Collins Kokkinakis-Nadal Louis Armstrong 11am/4pm BST Petkovic-Kvitova Osaka-Linette Isner-Struff 7pm/12am BST Gauff-Babos Stebe-Cilic Right I\u2019m back. What have I missed? It\u2019s 4-4 between Madison Keys and Zhu Lin, who\u2019s making her US Open main draw debut this year but is holding her own against the 10th seed. That\u2019s still the only match taking place around Flushing Meadows, as the rain continues to prevent play on the roofless courts. All doubles matches have been suspended for the day, and with the weather forecast for the next few hours rather touch and go, it\u2019s likely most of the singles matches will be postponed until tomorrow. After all that excitement, I\u2019m off to get some food. Shortly all eyes will be on Madison Keys, the 2017 finalist who won the biggest title of her career this month in Cincinnati, against China\u2019s Zhu Lin. They\u2019re on Louis Armstrong; unfortunately there\u2019s no indication organisers will move one of the delayed matches from the outside courts to Arthur Ashe. And what of Federer\u2019s thoughts after that win over Dzumhur? I just tried to make less errors and be better on the offensive. I was able to protect my serve after a sloppy first set. There were some big moments, I came through, buckled down and told myself I was not going to get broken, stayed tough and hung with him and that helps with my confidence for the next match. I\u2019m happy to have the roof here, I remember playing finals on Monday and it was a pleasure today. I know Danny well, he came to Switzerland to train with me and I played him a few times. Lucas I played him at Wimbledon. I hope they get to play today so they get a day rest tomorrow. You\u2019re not the only one, Roger. But the weather is still looking pretty horrible. A relieved Svitolina speaks: It was an incredible match. Thanks guys even though you didn\u2019t support me. It was one of the best atmospheres I played. It was really special. She\u2019s a big inspiration for everyone. In the second set I had to stay focused and play every point like it\u2019s the last one. I knew she would raise her level. It was incredibly tough and only a few points divided the match. I\u2019m sad for the players in the locker room [because of the rain]. I\u2019m lucky to have played. Williams is drawing on all of her reserves to stay in touch at 30-all on Svitolina\u2019s serve. But here\u2019s a sixth match point. And this time Williams goes long! Svitolina is beaming; Williams drops her head before giving her conqueror a warm smile at the net. Svitolina is delighted to scrape through in two tight sets, as well she should be. That was a cracking match. Williams trudges off court in what, if this was any ordinary 39-year-old, you\u2019d say was her final US Open. But it\u2019s impossible to count her out of next year\u2019s tournament. After five match points and eight deuces, Williams survives an extraordinary game to hold for 4-5! The 39-year-old sits down wearily in her chair. She\u2019s still in this tournament. But how much has that game taken out of her? Svitolina will serve for the match after the break, which Williams probably wishes would last for 90 minutes rather than 90 seconds. Next up for Federer in round three: either Dan Evans (or Danny Evans as Federer calls the Brit in his on-court interview) or the French 25th seed, Lucas Pouille. That match should have been starting around 10 minutes ago but the rain is falling once more. A third match point for Svitolina, just as Federer brings up his first. Federer quickly settles matters, before soaking in the applause of the adoring Arthur Ashe crowd. It was another slow start from the third seed, but he\u2019ll be pleased with the way he finished that. There\u2019s no end in sight on Louis Armstrong, however, where Svitolina has seen a fourth and fifth match point go begging. .. just as Dzumhur does what he has to on Arthur Ashe by holding serve, to 15. But the match is now on Federer\u2019s racket at 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, 5-4. An inauspicious start from Williams as another double fault, her fifth of the set, makes it 0-15. She regroups for 40-15. But Svitolina, just as she has done in this set, comes back at her for deuce. And now it\u2019s match point. Williams is sending Svitolina one way and the other ... and Williams peels off the winner! Deuce. Followed by a second match point \u2013 just as Dzumhur attempts to hold serve to stay in his contest with Federer, who leads 5-3 in the fourth. Where to look? Louis Armstrong, where an absorbing point is won by Williams when Svitolina, under so much pressure, nets ... The spectators, so disappointed after the match sprung into life towards the end of the first set and start of the second, are barely applauding Svitolina\u2019s surge as she canters through another service game, this one to love. It\u2019s 5-3 and Williams, having led 3-0 around 20 minutes ago, must hold serve to stay in this tournament. A hush descends on Louis Armstrong as Svitolina breaks Williams\u2019s resistance for 3-2 and then holds for 3-3. Svitolina has gone into lockdown mode, while Williams, perhaps understandably at the age of 39, is tiring, with her footwork just a step too slow. Another break for Svitolina as Williams tamely double faults and that\u2019s four games in a row for the fifth seed, who\u2019s turned this second set on its head and leads 6-4, 4-3. Svitolina steadies for 1-3 in the second as Federer forges a break ahead, 2-1, in the fourth. Federer\u2019s match is the last scheduled in the Arthur Ashe day session, but given there\u2019s been no play on the outside courts because of the continued rain, and the fact there\u2019s more than three hours until the night session begins, perhaps another match will be moved on to the main court. No confirmation of that yet, though. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a sporting cliche I detest more than \u201crolling back the years\u201d, so perhaps \u201cvintage Venus\u201d will do instead, as the 39-year-old, 22 years (!) after reaching the US Open final for the first time, has the crowd on their feet as she backs up the break from 0-40 down with a breathtaking rally for 3-0. What of Federer, you say? He\u2019s serving for the third set at 5-3, 30-15, in a match that is now nowhere near as competitive as Williams v Svitolina. Federer brings up a double set point. And he seals it on the first with an ace. Federer, having sent an imposter on to court for the first set, is now bossing the Bosnian, leading Dzumhur 3-6, 6-2, 6-3. Williams is giving away 15 years to her 24-year-old opponent, but you wouldn\u2019t know it as she covers the court like a teenager to sprint to 15-40 on Svitolina\u2019s serve. Williams breaks at the first opportunity to nudge ahead in a set for the first time in this match at 2-0. And it\u2019s no less than she deserves. Game on. Williams, bizarrely, had a cup of coffee brought on to court after the first set, but then promptly went off court for a bathroom break. Venus, your drink is getting cold! She doesn\u2019t even touch it when she returns, perhaps she should have done, because she slumps break point down, 30-40. She won\u2019t want to be broken here, having conceded serve in the first game of the opening set too. Svitolina nets. A tremendous volley from Williams gives her game point and Svitolina blazes into the tramlines. It\u2019s 4-6, 1-0 Williams. Dzumhur, meanwhile, flailing at 4-1 down in the third set against Federer, is ailing as he calls the trainer on for treatment to a rib or chest injury. He seems to be in some discomfort while serving, but manages to hold after the resumption for 4-2. Svitolina sprints to 30-0 but some breathtaking tennis from a stubborn Williams makes it 15-30. Svitolina\u2019s first double fault of the day makes it 30-all. Her boyfriend, Gael Monfils, looks a little uncomfortable in the stands. But a smart slice serve from Svitolina and she\u2019s got a fourth chance to seal this set. And Williams finally surrenders when her shot flies well beyond the baseline! Svitolina secures the first set 6-4 after 55 minutes but Williams gave her plenty to think about in that absorbing denouement. But Williams quickly undoes all of her good work when she slumps 15-40 down on serve. Two set points. Svitolina \u2013 on the run \u2013 hits well out on the first, and is blown away by some powerful hitting from Williams on the second. Williams grits her teeth, you can see how much this is taking out of her, and she promptly double faults. Set point number three. The pair trade several backhands, before Svitolina\u2019s effort whistles wide. Deuce. Advantage Williams. And Svitolina\u2019s return is long! A relieved Williams looks to the skies. Or more accurately the Louis Armstrong roof. She\u2019s still standing in this set at 5-4 down but Svitolina will get another chance to serve for it. Williams gets to 0-30. Svitolina reduces her deficit to 15-30 but Williams\u2019s higher spin catches her off-guard and she nets. 15-40. So a couple of chances for Williams to get one of the breaks back. Williams, with a sleeve on her right arm a la Kyrgios and Raonic of old, plays two messy shots and it\u2019s deuce. She chastises herself, which is rare to see. She\u2019s usually so calm on court, you\u2019d have no idea if she\u2019d just won or lost the point. But it does the job. Here\u2019s a third break point. Again Svitolina stands firm, but it\u2019s soon Williams\u2019s advantage once more, and this time Williams gets the breakthrough after a prolonged baseline duel! It\u2019s 5-3 Svitolina. Svitolina is refusing to let go of that opening-game break against Venus Williams and leads 4-2. And here\u2019s a chance to take a real stranglehold on the set as she carves out another break point. Svitolina seizes on it and she\u2019ll step up after the changeover to serve for the set at 5-2. Dan Evans\u2019s second-round match against Lucas Pouille has been moved from second on Court 13 to first on Court 12. So when \u2013 or perhaps that should be if \u2013 play begins on the roofless courts, Evans will in action at the same time as Johanna Konta. The latest word from organisers is that there\u2019ll be no play away from Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong before 4pm New York time/9pm BST. John McEnroe, after Greg Rusedski\u2019s Mystic Meg act earlier, ponders how many grand slams the Big Three are going to end up with. \u201c22 Djokovic, 21 or 20 for Federer, 21 or 22 for Nadal,\u201d he predicts, before saying Djokovic is his \u201cslight favourite\u201d for the all-time record. But back to more immediate matters. Federer gets to three set points on Dzumhur\u2019s serve in the blink of an eye. And Dzumhur concedes the set meekly, with his second double fault of the game. Federer, after losing the first set 6-3, has won the second 6-2. Elina Svitolina and Venus Williams are under way on Louis Armstrong in their intriguing encounter. Svitolina, who finally made her grand slam breakthrough at Wimbledon where she reached the semi-finals, has the look of a woman who means business, racing into a 2-0 lead against the 2000 and 2001 champion, who\u2019s playing in her 21st US Open. Even the GOAT \u2013 who\u2019s now 4-2 ahead against Dzumhur, by the way \u2013 can\u2019t beat that record. Williams gets on the board for 2-1 and is pushing hard on Svitolina\u2019s serve, but the Ukrainian fifth seed holds firm for 3-1 after three deuces. Federer has Dzumhur on a piece of string on the third point of the fourth game, and the spectators are lapping it up. I doubt Dzumhur is. The Bosnian, however, leads 30-15, and the diminutive 27-year-old jumps into a backhand and drills it down the line for 40-15. Dzumhur looks well set to take his first game of the set but a double fault combined with a netted effort and it\u2019s Federer\u2019s advantage. Federer can\u2019t, however, secure the double break and Dzumhur takes the next three points. It\u2019s 3-6, 3-1 Federer. Federer, with that late momentum from the last game, sprints to 0-40 on Dzumhur\u2019s serve. Some net charging from Dzumhur reduces his arrears to 30-40 but the third break point is a charm for Federer, who has come from break point down in the previous game to break for 2-0. Make that 3-0, as Federer finally glides through the gears and reduces his unforced error count. Another unforced error flies off the Federer racket and here\u2019s another break point for Dzumhur at 30-40 in the opening game of the second set. Federer could do with a first serve to get him out of trouble but he can\u2019t land it. The second one goes in, a lengthy point plays out, arguably the best of the match ... and Dzumhur drills into the net! That picks the crowd up a bit, who\u2019ve been fairly subdued so far. I wonder how much of a factor that is for Federer, who\u2019s far more used to playing in front of a buzzing night crowd. Federer steadies himself from deuce and holds for his first lead in a set in this match. Dzumhur is serving for the first set at 5-3. The Bosnian slips 0-15 down but takes the next point and immediately demands the same ball back. And it does the trick. 30-15. 40-15. Game and set to the world No 99! It\u2019s the first set Dzumhur\u2019s taken off Federer in three meetings. This is like the first round all over again for the five-times champion. Dzumhur isn\u2019t an ideal opponent for an opponent out of touch. He doesn\u2019t have a huge amount of firepower but what he lacks in size he makes up for in heart and he\u2019s happy to scrap and mix up the play. That said, Federer appears to be finding his feet, and gets his first couple of games on the board for 4-2. Well, well. There\u2019s the double break. Dzumhur leads 4-zip. Meanwhile Nishikori has refocused after being broken while serving for the match at 5-3, and he\u2019s completed a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory over Klahn on Louis Armstrong. It was hardly the most convincing of wins, but nonetheless, he\u2019s the first man to put a W by his name today as this pesky rain continues to hit the schedule. Federer started hesitantly in the first round, dropping the opening set to the 190th-ranked Sumit Nagal, and he\u2019s slow out of the blocks here, conceding serve in the second game to trail 2-0. The five-times champion, who turned 38 a few weeks ago, has played only two matches since that letting that epic Wimbledon final slip away from two championship points up. It this rustiness or scar tissue from that defeat to Novak Djokovic? We\u2019ll see, but a ninth unforced error from Federer allows Dzumhur to get to 3-0 and Federer\u2019s soon 0-30 down on serve. Remember these are the only two matches taking place at Flushing Meadows, with the rain still drumming down and delaying Johanna Konta\u2019s second-round meeting with Margarita Gasparyan. What a difference a year makes, eh? This time 12 months ago we were talking about the stifling heat and humidity in New York. The rain could persist for much of today, but the forecast is much better from tomorrow onwards. The good news for Nishikori is that he\u2019s serving for the match at 5-3 in the fourth set. The bad news is he\u2019s won only two of the last 10 points. And that record doesn\u2019t get any better as he slides 15-40 down, giving the home player two break points. Klahn capitalises and they\u2019re back on serve, with Nishikori 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 5-4 ahead. Pliskova\u2019s win means here come Roger Federer and the bearded Bosnian Damir Dzumhur on to Arthur Ashe. Will Federer be put off by having to play in the day session? He\u2019s not had to do that too many times over the years. Mind you, given how gloomy it is today, it almost feels as if it\u2019s the evening. And he\u2019ll be happy the roof is on, he\u2019s such a dangerous player indoors. Pliskova is set to become the first player through to round three but Nishikori is doing his best to push her close. He\u2019s ripping through the games in the fourth set and leads Klahn 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 3-0. And here\u2019s Pliskova with a match point on serve, to add to the one she had on Bolkvadze\u2019s in the previous game. Bolkvadze\u2019s choppy return flies high into the air and lands wide in the tramlines. Pliskova celebrates, as does her coach and former Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martinez. Apart from one loose service game, that was an impressive display from the third seed. Pliskova, now 5-3 ahead, brings up match point at 30-40 on Bolkvadze\u2019s serve. Bolkvadze bashes down her best serve of the day \u2013 what a time to do it \u2013 and Pliskova nets. Deuce. And Bolkvadze comes through from there and lives to fight another day! Or more accurately, probably, another game, because Pliskova will come out after the changeover and serve for the match. Svitolina should be tested by Venus today. At 39, the 2000 and 2001 champion perhaps doesn\u2019t have what it takes to go all the way any more, but is still more than capable of pulling off a result. Roger Federer, meanwhile, will follow Pliskova on Arthur Ashe, and that should be fairly soon because Pliskova, despite dropping serve early in the second set, has broken Bolkvadze both literally and figuratively in a tortuous game and now leads 6-1, 4-2. \u201cI think Elina Svitolina is going to get her first major,\u201d emails Cory Knights. Yes Svitolina is definitely a name to add to the list of contenders, especially after her long-awaited breakthrough at Wimbledon, where she reached the semi-finals of a slam for the first time, before being beaten by the eventual champion, Simona Halep. Svitolina, the fifth seed, could takes on Venus Williams on Louis Armstrong today, after Nishikori v Klahn. Nishikori has re-established order there and is serving for a two sets to one lead, at 6-2, 4-6, 5-3. Klahn clunks long and Nishikori bags the set. Kyrgios backtracks: Who do you think could go all the way? Serena Williams was the most impressive in round one, marmalising Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-1 in the latest instalment of their fiercest of (un)rivalries, but questions remain about her fitness. Naomi Osaka, Ashleigh Barty and Simona Halep all needed three sets to advance but have the pedigree to go all the way, as does Petra Kvitova \u2013 if fit. And Bianca Andreescu and Madison Keys surely have to be in the mix after their title wins in Toronto and Cincinnati respectively. We\u2019ll get another look at Williams, Barty and Keys today. Remember you can get in touch with any predictions or predilections via email or Twitter. Pliskova is rolling today, but what of the other women\u2019s title favourites so far this week? They\u2019ve been a model of consistency \u2013 which is not something I\u2019ve typed often during the past few years \u2013 with all top 10 seeds reaching round two. However Sloane Stephens, the 2017 champion and 11th seed, was stunned under the lights last night, losing 6-3, 6-4 to the Russian qualifier Anna Kalinskaya. It\u2019s been a fairly frustrating grand slam season for the inconsistent American, who rehired her former coach Kamau Murray only days before the Open. Perhaps that will help salvage the rest of her year. Bolkvadze is a bundle of nerves in front of a smattering of fans on a gloomy, roof-covered Arthur Ashe, and the left-hander wobbles down three consecutive double faults to give Pliskova the chance to break for a 5-1 lead in the opening set. Pliskova makes no mistakes. And then does what Bolkvadze can\u2019t, delivering an accomplished service game to take the first set 6-1 in 20 minutes. We\u2019re hearing there\u2019ll be no play on the roofless courts \u2013 including Grandstand where Johanna Konta is due to kick off the schedule \u2013 until at least 1pm local time/6pm BST. Meanwhile in sunnier climes, Andy Murray has a day off in Mallorca \u2013 and, according to the BBC\u2019s Russell Fuller, has been loaned Rafa\u2019s boat. Murray will play his third-round match at Nadal\u2019s Challenger event tomorrow. It could be game on between Nishikori and Klahn, who has scrambled from a break down to put himself within one game of the second set. Nishikori is serving, trailing 5-4, 30-15 ... make that 40-15, two set points. Klahn chops his return back, Nishikori charges to the net ... and Klahn pulls off the pass to level at one set all! Klahn is roaring, while Nishikori scurries off court for a quick break. It\u2019s a wonder Bolkvadze can move out there, but she skips to the baseline to receive Pliskova\u2019s serve, which is one of the strongest in the women\u2019s game. Pliskova, seeded third this year, opens with an assured hold to 15, rounding things off with two consecutive aces. With Nishikori still a break up in the second set against Klahn, leading 6-2, 4-2, the tall figure of Karolina Pliskova, perhaps the best female player not to win a grand slam (is there a more backhanded compliment in tennis?), has arrived on Arthur Ashe. The 2016 finalist is taking on the Georgian qualifier Mariam Bolkvadze, who\u2019s half-mummified in tape, with her right thigh, left calf and left ankle heavily strapped. Disappointment for those looking forward to Borna Coric v Grigor Dimitrov later. Coric has withdrawn because of a lower back strain. But the Croatian\u2019s misfortune is Dimitrov\u2019s gain and, given the Bulgarian\u2019s horrendous form this summer, he\u2019ll gratefully take all the help he can get. Klahn is adopting a similar tactic to Nishikori on serve, going for speed at the expense of precision. He\u2019s just not landing enough of them and here are three break points for Nishikori at 1-1 in the second set. Klahn fist pumps not once, not twice but thrice, after saving all of them. Deuce. But another break point opportunity soon arises for Nishikori, and a bullet of a backhand return seals it. It\u2019s 6-2, 2-1 Nishikori. Nishikori didn\u2019t exactly get into his serving groove in the first set, with his first-serve percentage down at a lowly 35%, but he\u2019s taken it nonetheless, 6-2 against Klahn. Karen Khachanov, the rising Russian who pushed Rafael Nadal close in New York last year, was another big seed to fall yesterday, meaning four of the men\u2019s top 10 are out. Will this be yet another slam where the Big Three reign supreme and the young guns (some of whom are more like middle-aged guns now) fail to fire? Daniil Medvedev\u2019s form suggests he\u2019s the best-placed of the Next Gen to challenge Djokovic, Federer and Nadal. The 23-year-old Russian won the Cincinnati title a week and a half ago, after reaching the finals in Washington and Montreal. But will all those matches catch up with him? His hamstring was bothering him during his first-round win, and the fifth seed\u2019s second on Grandstand today against the Bolivian Hugo Dellien. If Kyrgios can hold it together this fortnight \u2013 and it\u2019s a big if \u2013 he has an excellent chance of reaching the semi-finals, given the only seeds left in his decimated quarter of the draw are Gael Monfils and Matteo Berrettini, following the defeats of Dominic Thiem, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Roberto Bautista Agut, Felix Auger Aliassime and Kyle Edmund yesterday. Speaking of Kyrgios ... another day and another Kyrgios in hot water story. He\u2019s put himself at risk of a suspension by the ATP after calling the governing body corrupt for fining him a record $113,000 following his sweary/racket smashing/umpire berating meltdown in Cincinnati this month. His comments came after his first-round win over Steve Johnson last night, during which, after Kyrgios received a code violation for an audible obscenity, his exasperated American opponent asked: \u201cDo you want to play fucking tennis or host a shit show?\u201d Kyrgios went on to win 6-3, 7-6 (1), 6-4. Martina Navratilova\u2019s a brave lady. Having been in the line of Nick Kyrgios\u2019s fire the other day for sharing her thoughts on the Australian firebrand, she\u2019s at it again. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d she jokes on Amazon Prime when asked about his coaching options. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he respects anybody. Certainly Roger if he was coaching he\u2019d be listening to him. He needs help off the court. That\u2019s clear.\u201d We\u2019ve got some tennis! Nishikori, the seventh seed, is under way against the 29-year-old American Bradley Klahn, who hasn\u2019t been beyond the first round of a slam since the US Open in 2014, when Nishikori reached the final. So this could be another straightforward day for Nishikori, who had an easy time of it in the first round, with his opponent Marco Trungelliti retiring injured. Nishikori\u2019s in the early ascendancy, leading 2-1 with the break. Greg Rusedski is talking on t\u2019telly. He reckons Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal will both overtake Roger Federer\u2019s overall grand slam record. Rusedski\u2019s gazed into his crystal ball and predicts Djokovic will finish top on 23 major titles (seven more than the defending champion currently has), with Nadal collecting three more to end his career on 21, with Federer remaining on 20. It\u2019s a big call to say Djokovic will win another seven, but the world No 1 has time and fitness on his side, and who\u2019s coming through to challenge him? Just as I was about to type that it\u2019s stopped raining at Flushing Meadows, it\u2019s started again. Gah. There\u2019ll be no play on the outside courts until at least midday local time/5pm BST, while Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong \u2013 the two courts with roofs \u2013 will stick to their schedules. Karolina Pliskova will start on Ashe in an hour\u2019s time, while we\u2019re just waiting for Kei Nishikori and Bradley Klahn to step on to Armstrong.

So much for New York, it\u2019s more like Old York on day three, with the Williams sisters, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic \u2013 boasting a combined age of 146 and 66 grand slam titles between them \u2013 the headline acts as the second round gets under way. It\u2019s the night session for Djokovic and Serena, and the day for Federer and Venus who, appearing in her 21st Open a year short of her 40th birthday, will be the underdog against the Wimbledon semi-finalist and fifth seed, Elina Svitolina. That could be one of the matches of the day on the women\u2019s side, where the French Open champion, Ashleigh Barty, the once world No 1 Karolina Pliskova and the in-form Cincinnati winner, Madison Keys, play too. After Kyle Edmund\u2019s grand slam season came to a disappointing end yesterday, British hopes rest with Johanna Konta and Dan Evans. Konta was due to open on Grandstand in just over 10 minutes\u2019 time but unfortunately the weather isn\u2019t behaving and she\u2019ll be delayed by rain. When the British No 1 does get on she\u2019ll face her second consecutive Russian opponent in Margarita Gasparyan, while Evans, after scrapping and snarling his way past Adrian Mannarino in the first round, has another tricky French test against the world No 27, Lucas Pouille. Elsewhere we\u2019ll get another look at the man of the hard-court summer, Daniil Medvedev, the 2016 champion, Stan Wawrinka, the 2014 runner-up, Kei Nishikori, and what could be a tasty encounter between the talented Croatian Borna Coric and Grigor Dimitrov \u2013 as long as the old Grigor Dimitrov turns up. The new Grigor Dimitrov has had an awful year and hasn\u2019t managed to string more than two successive wins together since the Australian Open back in January. Play was due to begin: at 11am New York time/4pm BST but it looks as if the only action we\u2019ll have is Nishikori against the American Bradley Klahn under the Louis Armstrong roof.",

      "bodyText": "There was a moment in Roger Federer\u2019s win against Damir Dzumhur here on day three of the US Open when the Bosnian underdog lost whatever sympathy the crowd afforded him as he turned on the umpire, Eva Asderaki-Moore, and barked: \u201cWhen I ask you a question, you answer me OK?\u201d Asderaki-Moore said nothing. Dzumhur chuntered on. Much good it did him, as Federer recovered from 0-4 in the first set to win 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 in 2hr 22min under the roof on Arthur Ashe. Inexplicably, play was suspended on the unsheltered courts during a brief window of dryness and delayed further when it drizzled again in late afternoon. So the chance to squeeze in some play came and went like a cloud. More worrying than dim-witted scheduling is the continued verbal assault on officials. These churlish and offensive outbreaks \u2013 routine behaviour for decades and hitting a peak this year \u2013 do not fit with what would be regarded as civilised behaviour in most other areas of social discourse and the sense of entitlement of some players is breathtaking. It should not matter what the grievance is; to speak with such curtness to someone who is powerless to respond \u2013 except by censure \u2013 is out of order. Whatever Nick Kyrgios thinks, he is not the only bad boy in class. The schoolyard is full of them. To Federer\u2019s credit, the best behaved man in sport ignored the minor spat across the net, as well as a rousing start by the gifted Dzumhur, to cruise stylishly into the third round. He will be mildly concerned, however, that, for the second time in three days, he has lost the first set to a rank outsider, to the elegant Indian strokemaker Sumit Nagal in round one and this time against Dzumhur before regaining his composure in the second set. When he did get back on song, he made the sweetest music with his racket. Federer had a pliant audience in fits of ecstasy time and again, memorably in the third set when he found a backhand from heaven, wide in the tramlines, that cut across Dzumhur\u2019s charge at the net like a scimitar, landing gently beyond his reach. Dzumhur, 99 in the world but better than that, was struggling in all sorts of ways, demoralised now after correctly imagining at the start of the match that he might pull off the upset that was beyond Nagal on Monday night. In the third set, he was refused a medical timeout when he complained of breathing difficulties and while that cannot have helped his disposition he got back on serve and aced Federer to cut the lead back to 2-4. Dzumhur, a talented player who dropped outside the top hundred in August for the first time in four years, has suffered with various complaints in a summer of mixed fortunes: he has made three quarter-finals, beating Stefanos Tsitsipas in Rotterdam and Stan Wawrinka in Geneva, before injuries to his back, abdomen and shoulder from Miami to Halle struck him down. If you\u2019re not fully fit against Federer, you\u2019re toast. Dzumhur soon had the trainer back on court to look at a pain under his ribs, unable to articulate in English exactly what he thought the problem was \u2013 but he carried on. He does not lack for heart, although he continued to rant to nobody in particular, holding for 3-5, his movement and serve as efficient as it was at the start.

Lincoln City gave Everton a fright at Goodison Park in last season\u2019s FA Cup so, despite an iffy run in League One, they\u2019ll fancy their chances of toppling the Premier Leaguers at a sold-out Sincil Bank today. That would leave Marco Silva in a heap of bother after Everton\u2019s unconvincing start to the season. And how about Forest Green at Bournemouth, or Sunderland at Burnley? Could Cambridge upset the odds at Swansea? Can Portsmouth do any better at QPR than they did in the FA Cup last season even though QPR are playing even better now? </p> <p>And who will prevail in the Yorkshire derby between Rotherham and Sheffield Wednesday, who drew 2-2 in each of their meetings last season before Rotherham were relegated from the Championship? Meanwhile in today\u2019s only all-Premier League encounter, Brendan Rodgers, who says he is trying to establish a winning culture at Leicester, will be hoping his team dispose of Newcastle, who could do Steve Bruce a power of good by following up their victory at Tottenham by winning at St James\u2019 Park \u2013 but how many will be there to see it? </p> <p> The answers to those and other questions are about to be revealed. Stay tuned! </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T16:57:35.942Z\">at 5.57pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Newcastle 0-1 Leicester Newcastle 1-1 Leicester. Shootout coming up ... GOAL! Rotherham 0-1 Sheffield Wednesday (Nuhi 90+6) Wednesday avert a shootout by scrambling in a winning goal after a last-gasp corner! Mark Travers is the hero for Bournemouth, the young Irish keeper saving Forest Green\u2019s first three penalties to give the Premier League team a 3-0 win in the shootout. A sickening way for Forest Green to go out after such a valiant performance. Bournemouth 0-0 Forest Green (3-0 pens) Mark Travers has saved Forest Green\u2019s first penalty in the shootout, keeping out Mills\u2019 effort after King scored Bournemouth\u2019s first. Solanke then rolls in their second ... GOAL! Ajax 2-0 Apoel (Tadic 80) (agg: 2-0) Full-time: QPR 0-2 Portsmouth Full-time: Swansea 6-0 Cambridge Full-time: Burnley 1-3 Sunderland Forest Green have taken Bournemouth to a penalty shootout after holding out for a 0-0 draw GOAL! Lincoln 2-4 Everton (Richarlison 88) Digne hares down the left and sends over a decent cross. Richarlison meets with a splendid header from near the penalty spot, and the Premier League team have sealed victory. They started awfully - conceding after 21 seconds - but they came back strongly and deserve the win they are about to claim. GOAL! Club Brugge 1-1 Linz (Klauss pen 74) (Agg: 2-1) That place in the group stages is looking precarious for the Belgians now: another away goal would send the Austrian first-timers through instead... Wollacott makes a nice close-range save to thwart Josh King, who seemed set to score when he met a header six yards out. Forest Green continue to defy their Premier League hosts! Bournemouth 0-0 Forest Green GOAL! Lincoln 2-3 Everton (Iwobi 81) The Premier League side are back in front thanks to a brave close-range header by the impressive Iwobi, who nodded in from five yards after Tosun met a cross beyond the far post and headed the ball across goal. GOAL! Club Brugge 1-0 Linz (Vanaken 70) (agg: 2-0) The Belgians seems to be headed for the group stages, too. GOAL! QPR 0-2 Portsmouth (Harness 81) A simple tap-in from the forward following a break down the let by Kenny Jackett\u2019s men, who are on course to be included in the third round draw, which, by the way, will be coming up right here after the final whistles. GOAL! Slavia Prague 1-0 Cluj (Boril 66) (agg: 2-0) Celtic fans can only dream about what might have been. GOAL! Swansea 6-0 Cambridge (Routledge 76) Thanks to Wayne Routledge, Swansea are now leading by one more goal than they beat Bradford City by in the 2013 League Cup final. GOAL! QPR 0-1 Portsmouth (Marquis pen 77) Marquis sends the keeper the wrong way before rolling the ball into the opposite corner from the spot. GOAL! Lincoln 2-2 Everton (Andrade 64) Did you Harvey Barnes\u2019 goal for Leicester against Sheffield United last weekend? Well this one is much better! Andrade struck it with similar pace but on the volley, from 16 yards. Pickford dived but was never going to stop it - in fact, I\u2019m not convinced he even saw it. Lincoln 2-2 Everton An incredible, inadvertent goalmouth clearance at Bournemouth, where a shot by Jack Stacey hits the post and is then scooped off the line by Josh King, who had fallen and knew nothing about Bournemouth 0-0 Forest Green NO GOAL! Ajax 1-0 Apoel (agg: 1-0) After a lengthy VAR review, Huntelaar\u2019s goal is chalked off, as replays show his foot was fractionally offside. Iwobi, who\u2019s had a fine game, comes close to making things more comfortable for Everton at Sincil Bank, but his swerving shot from the edge of the box goes a yard wide. Lincoln 1-2 Everton GOAL! Ajax 2-0 Apoel (Huntelaar 50) (agg: 2-0) It looks like the Dutch will be back in the Champions League group stages. Shelvey does very well to track back and block a shot by Perez after Leicester launched a rapid counter-attack following a Newcastle corner. Newcastle 1-1 Leicester GOAL! Lincoln 1-2 Everton (Sigurdsson pen 59) The Icelander curls an unstoppable shot into the top-corner. Then he jogs into the net to retrieve the ball for some reason. Lincoln players take grievous exception and lots of pushing and shoving ensues. Penalty to Everton as Sigurdsson goes down between two defenders. GOAL! Newcastle 1-1 Leicester (Muto 53) A long diagonal freekick from halfway finds Willems burst down the left and, despite a challenge from a defender he manages to bundle it through to Muto, who converts from close range. Down at Loftus Road, Pugh almost gives the home side the lead but heads straight at the keeper after doing well to outjump a defender. QPR 0-0 Portsmouth GOAL! Burnley 1-3 Sunderland (Dobson 50) The Mackems are having a party! They increase their lead with a canny cornerkick routine, pulling the ball to Dobson at the edge of the box and he guides a low drive beyond Hart and into the net. GOAL! Burnley 1-2 Sunderland (Flanagan 47) Burnley have won one match in six years in this competition and they\u2019re in danger of mucking this one up here: after leading 1-0 and missing an open goal, they\u2019ve now trailing at home to League One visitors. Tom Flanagan nodded in from close range after Hart made a save but batted the ball straight out to him. The first goal of the day in the Champions League has gone to last season\u2019s semi-finalists, Ajax, who have finally managed to edge in front of Apoel thanks to Edson Alvares. Ajax 1-0 Apoel (agg: 1-0) Burnley 1-1 Sunderland Lincoln 1-1 Everton Newcastle 0-1 Leicester Rotherham 0-0 Sheffield Wed Swansea 5-0 Cambridge QPR 0-0 Portsmouth Bournemouth 0-0 Forest Green Half-time: Lincoln 1-1 Everton. After falling being in the 21st second, Everton took control and should really be in front by now. They equalised through a wonderful goal by Digne but then missed a couple of good chances. Matt Ritchie has had to be replaced at St James\u2019s Park after being hurt in a challenge by Hamza Choudhury. The Leicester midfielder won the ball cleanly but seemed to catch Ritchie accidentally on the follow-through - Choudhury shouldn\u2019t have slid in - it wasn\u2019t necessary - but the tackle didn\u2019t seem malicious. Newcastle 0-1 Leicester GOAL! Swansea 5-0 Cambridge (Surridge 44) A snappy one-two concludes with a smart finish at the near post from the striker, who bags his second of the evening ... so far. Half-time: Bournemouth 0-0 Forest Green Iwobi canters down the right before picking out Richarlsion with a nice pass. The Brazilian lets fly first time but it flashes wide of the near post. Richarlison tries again moment later, but with the same result. Lincoln are clinging on. Lincoln 1-1 Everton Kean sends on defender falling backwards in confusion as he scampers down the right and into the box and then blems a powerful shot ... against the post! Lincoln 1-1 Everton GOAL! Lincoln 1-1 Everton (Digne 36) Wow! That\u2019s helluva way to equalise! Digne curls a sumptuous freekick into the top corner from 30 yards. He could not have struck it any better. GOAL! Burnley 1- Sunderland (Grigg 35) Yes, yes, he\u2019s on fire. GOAL! Newcastle 0-1 Leicester (Maddison 34) A long-range freekick by Maddison takes a decisive deflection off Ritchie and bamboozles the keeper and flies into the net. That\u2019s jammy but Leicester don\u2019t care. GOAL! Swansea 4-0 Cambridge (Garrick 30) Moments after Cambridge hit the bar, Swansea take the game further away from them. Garrick, who created the first goal, gets his name on the scoresheet by slamming home after Routledge\u2019s shot is parried. Lennon cracks a low shot against the post from the edge of the box. The rebound fall to Vydra near the penalty spot. He has an open goal but little time ... and he bashes his rushed shot off the other post! Burnley 1-0 Sunderland Wollacott turns away a low effort by Ibe. Bournemouth 0-0 Forest Green Smith makes a decent save from Kean as Lincoln continue to fend off Everton and hold on to the lead they claimed in the 21st second. Only another hour or so to hang on ... Lincoln 1-0 Everton GOAL! Swansea 3-0 Cambridge (Surridge 24) Fair to say this contest looks to be over. The goal originated in an attack down the left again and then, after some ropey defending, Surridge poked a loose ball into the net from six yard. In their first ever match against a top-flight team, Forest Green are holding their own. But they were nearly undone by Surman, who wriggled his way past two defenders at the edge of the area before firing just wide of the upright. Bournemouth 0-0 Forest Green GOAL! Swansea 2-0 Cambridge (Byers 20) A handy close-range finish after a sharp break down the left. Delph flights a fine diagonal pass to Digne, who takes it down near the left-hand corner flag and then pulls it back to Iwobi, who wraps his foot around a lovely curler from the edge of the box. Smith palms the shot over the bar. Still Lincoln 1-0 Everton Lincoln thresten on the counter-attack, as Andrada scurries down the left wing and tries to pick out Akinde at the far post. But he overhits his cross. Delighted cheers at Sincil Bank as Sigurdsson tonk a shot over the bar from the edge of the area. Everton are dominating but haven\u2019t really looked like scoring yet. GOAL! Burnley 1-0 Sunderland (Rodriguez 11) Dainty work by Vydra, who then sets up his strike partner for a tidy finish from 12 yards. That\u2019s Rodriguez\u2019s first goal since rejoining Burnley. Down at Bournemouth, Harry Wilson was almost up to his usual tricks, but a well-hit freekick from 25 yards flew just over the top corner. Everton are having a lot of possession at Sincil Bank, as you\u2019d expect, but the hosts are working fiercely to protect their lead. Everton haven\u2019t been able to work any kind of opening yet. There was nearly an early goal at St James\u2019 Park, too, but Darlow made a good save to prevent Ayoze Perez from celebrating his return with a quickfire goal for Leicester. GOAL! Lincoln 1-0 Everton (Anderson 1) Oh dear Everton! Payne drives to the byline on the left and cuts the ball back to Anderson, who slots it into the net from 10 yards! Everton held out for a grand total of 21 seconds! GOAL! Swansea 1-0 Cambridge (Peterson 1) Swansea have changed their whole side but no matter, they take the lead with their first attack. Garrick did brilliantly down the right before teeing up Peterson, who slammed it hom. Let\u2019s not forget there are three big Champions qualifiers today, kicking off imminently. They are: Ajax v Apoel Nicosia (0-0 after first leg) Club Brugge - Linz ASK (1-0) Slavia Prague v Cluj (1-0) QPR: Kelly, Kane, Leistner, Barbet, Manning, Smith, Owens, Osayi-Samuel, Chair, Pugh, Mlakar Portsmouth: MacGillivray, McCrorie, Downing, Burgess, Haunstrup, Close, Naylor, Evans, Harness, Marquis, Curtis Rotherham: Iversen; Olosunde, Ihiekwe, Wood, Robertson; Wiles, Barlaser, Crooks, Ladapo; Smith, Vassell Sheffield Wednesday: Dawson; Iorfa, Thorniley, Bates, Fox, Murphy, Pelupessy, Luongo, Winnall, Rhodes, Nuhiu Danny Drinkwater a notable inclusion in a much-changed Burnley lineup. Burnley: Hart; Bardsley, Long, Gibson, Taylor; Lennon, Hendrick, Drinkwater, McNeil; Rodriguez, Vydra Sunderland: Burge; McLaughlin, Flanagan, Baldwin, Hume; Dobson, McGeouch, O\u2019Nien, Embleton; Gooch, Grigg Eddie Howe had made nine changes to his team, including bringing in Irish youth internationals Gavin Kilkenny and goalkeeper Mark Travers. Full-back Jack Stacey also makes his first starting since joining this summer from Luton. Forest Green makes severn changes. Bournemouth: Travers; Stacey, Mepham, Simpson, Rico; Wilson, Kilkenny, Surman, Ibe; Solanke, C Wilson Forest Green: Wollacott; Bernard, Rawson, Grubb, Stevens, Morton, Dawson, McGinley, Kitching, Godwin-Malife, Mondal Swansea have changed their entire starting lineup from their last Championship game. Swansea City: Nordfeldt, Naughton (c), Cabango, Wilmot, John, Byers, Carroll, Garrick, Routledge, Peterson, Surridge. Cambridge boss Colin Calderwood also shuffled his pack in the previous round and, like Cooper, he does the same again. Sidibe, Delph, Iwobi and Kean all make their first starts for Everton. After making a big difference when they came on in the pitiful defeat to Aston Villa, Iwobi and Keane have a strong chance to stake a claim for regular action. Lincoln: Smith; Lewis, Bolger, Shackell, Toffold; O\u2019Connell, Morrell, Payne, Andersson, Andrade; Akinde Everton: Pickford; Sidibe, Keane, Holgate, Digne; Schneiderlin, Delph; Richarlison, Sigurdsson, Iwobi; Kean The team news is starting to tumble in. First up, Brendan Rodgers wasn\u2019t messing when he said he would take this tournament seriously: that\u2019s a fine team he\u2019s sending out at Newcastle, who\u2019ve made seven alterations but look pretty strong themselves. Newcastle: Darlow; Sch\u00e4r, Clark, Fernandez, Ritchie; Krafth, Shelvey, Willems Longstaff, Hayden; Ritchie; Muto Leicester: Schmeichel; Pereira, Morgan, Soyuncu, Fuchs; Choudhury, Tielemans; Perez, Maddison, Barnes; Vardy Just the seven ties to follow today but there\u2019s no lack of intrigue in prospect. Lincoln City gave Everton a fright at Goodison Park in last season\u2019s FA Cup so, despite an iffy run in League One, they\u2019ll fancy their chances of toppling the Premier Leaguers at a sold-out Sincil Bank today. That would leave Marco Silva in a heap of bother after Everton\u2019s unconvincing start to the season. And how about Forest Green at Bournemouth, or Sunderland at Burnley? Could Cambridge upset the odds at Swansea? Can Portsmouth do any better at QPR than they did in the FA Cup last season even though QPR are playing even better now? And who will prevail in the Yorkshire derby between Rotherham and Sheffield Wednesday, who drew 2-2 in each of their meetings last season before Rotherham were relegated from the Championship? Meanwhile in today\u2019s only all-Premier League encounter, Brendan Rodgers, who says he is trying to establish a winning culture at Leicester, will be hoping his team dispose of Newcastle, who could do Steve Bruce a power of good by following up their victory at Tottenham by winning at St James\u2019 Park \u2013 but how many will be there to see it? The answers to those and other questions are about to be revealed. Stay tuned!",

Sure, ladies, you have a little job and take it as seriously as you like, but when there is politics to be done, your presence, which begins and ends at decorative, is required.\u201d Australia\u2019s living standards withstood the fallout from the global recession but in the decade since we have squandered our comparative advantage, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cThe faltering of our living standards compared with the rest of the OECD is made clear when we look at the growth since 2007. You can see that we soared through the GFC compared with everyone else, and yet we have utterly failed to take advantage, and now over the past 12 years the OECD has on average seen household incomes grow by more than ours.\u201d Sport The All Blacks flanker Matt Todd is no stranger to the feeling of deja vu. Indeed, he could have been forgiven for fearing he would experience the same thing three times, before finally being named this week in a New Zealand Rugby World Cup squad. World No 30 Nick Kyrgios yesterday accused the ATP of corruption before clarifying his comments, but he owes tennis better behaviour after a series of misdemeanours and aggressive displays on court, writes Kevin Mitchell.\u201d Thinking time: \u201cIt\u2019s all just meat\u201d \u2013 what makes hardcore wrestler Alan Mann tick? Alex Mann positions my phone on a Melbourne pub table, hits record and leans forward. I press a staple gun flush against his forehead. \u201cYou ready?\u201d I ask. \u201cYep,\u201d he says, squeezing his eyes shut. I fire a staple into his skull and he groans, hams it up a bit, then digs it out with my car key. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t my idea, but belatedly I wonder if I should have participated in this. Mann has a brain injury from being repeatedly coshed with a DVD player while wrestling as his alter ego, KrackerJak, at the end of 2017. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a difference,\u201d he assures me. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to get hurt taking the body slam than you are stapling yourself. It\u2019s all just meat.\u201d Mann is a hardcore wrestler, which means his fights are known as death matches. In these sadistic soap operas, opponents use bins, ladders, trestle tables and other household objects to inflict ultraviolence upon one another.Growing up in country Victoria, Mann gawked at the pumped-up heroes of fantasy and action movies. \u201cYou don\u2019t read the campiness when you\u2019re six,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, bad dudes in leather. What a tough guy. Look at that big moustache. Look how big their chests are.\u201d Media roundup The Age reports that Australia is at risk of experiencing a recession if the trade war between the US and China escalates, with more than 500,000 Aussie jobs in the firing line. Archaeologists in Peru have unearthed hundreds of child remains, saying the children were sacrificed by an earlier culture to to appease the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon. It is the largest sacrifice of children ever discovered, the ABC reports. And the West Australian reports that Donald Trump may soon visit Australia, after the US president lavished praise on Scott Morrison, calling him a \u201cfantastic\u201d PM. Coming up Witness K is to plead guilty in the ACT to conspiring to share secret information with the Timor-Leste government. Ashleigh Barty is to play Lauren Davis in the second round of the US Open.

      "bodyText": "If you want to hang with Greta Thunberg, make America Greta again, do your bit to protest inaction on the climate crisis, etc, etc, then midtown Manhattan is where you need to be this Friday. She\u2019s going to be taking part in a general strike outside the United Nations headquarters. Asked just now on the dockside, after disembarking from the yacht that carried her across the Atlantic, what she was going to do for the rest of the day/week, after spending 15 days at sea, Thunberg said first she was going to have a little rest. \u201cI\u2019m going to just relax first and walk around and just land, in a way,\u201d she said. Then she added: \u201cThis Friday I\u2019m going to join the strike outside the UN, and then more events of course, and meeting people.\u201d Appropriately, the famous \u201cknotted gun\u201d sculpture outside the UN building is the work of Thunberg\u2019s fellow Swede, artist CarlFredrik Reuterswaerd. And with that, we close this special live blog. Greta is giving Guardian environment reporter Oliver Milman an interview right now, so do catch up with that story on the website in a few. And for all the US political news of the day, ongoing, the daily politics live blog is still....live! Do take a look, still plenty of news to come. OMG do NOT ever try to condescend to Greta Thunberg! Listening in on a conversation she just had with some journalist or other (not the Guardian, I hasten to add, that comes later, keep an eye on the website for her interview!), dude asks her: \u201cDon\u2019t you just want to be a kid?\u201d Thunberg says: \u201cI would love not to have to do this and just go to school, but I want to do this because I want to make a difference. \u201cThe older generation are the ones who are causing this problem [of the climate crisis] and they should not be saying to us \u2018just be a normal kid\u2019. Because they are the ones that caused this and we are just trying to clean up after them.\u201d TKO, end of interview. Greta, out. Big picture Greta Thunberg has finished talking and taking questions at a short, open-air press conference next to the dock, where her transatlantic yacht just tied up 15 days after she left Britain. She\u2019s arrived in America to address the United Nations general assembly next month on the issue of the climate emergency, as well as to attend other meetings, and also travel to Chile for an environmental event. At one point, she stumbled over her words and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my brain isn\u2019t working correctly\u201d after a rough crossing, during which she did not feel seasick, she said. She appeared tired but happy and managed her usual succinct summing up of the climate crisis. \u201cWe have to take responsibility and see the big picture,\u201d she said. Thunberg has now walked back to the yacht, where she said she was going to collect her belongings. She just told a journalist: \u201cI didn\u2019t feel bad at all, I felt good even though it was a bit rough sometimes. I was extremely lucky. For me it was really good.\u201d \u201cThe best moment of the trip, it\u2019s so hard to pick because there are so incredibly many. But...leaving and to see all the people waving and to arrive and see all the people - and just doing nothing [out at sea].\u201d Sea legs After more than two weeks at sea, Greta Thunberg is being very much herself. After admitting that she was looking forward to a wash and rest, she talked of what she\u2019ll miss about being out in the Atlantic \u201csitting for hours and staring at the ocean, doing nothing, I\u2019m going to miss that a lot. To see the beauty of it, that I\u2019m also going to miss. Peace and quiet.\u201d Greta Thunberg said that while she was out at sea she heard about the fires raging in the Amazonian rainforest, principally in Brazil. \u201cEven on a boat I heard about the fires in the Amazon, the rainforest. It\u2019s devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so horrible. It\u2019s hard to imagine. The war against nature must end.\u201d \u2018Listen to the science,\u2019 Thunberg tells Trump \u201cEveryone always asks me about Donald Trump,\u201d Greta Thunberg just said in her press conference after arriving in New York on a yacht across the Atlantic. \u201cI say \u2018Listen to the science\u2019 and he obviously does not do that. If no-one has been able to convince him about the climate crisis and the urgency, why would I be able to?\u201d \u201cThis is a fight across borders, across continents,\u201d Thunberg just said about her battle to persuade the world to take action quickly to reverse the climate crisis, \u201cto save the Earth.\u201d She pointed out that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to cross the Atlantic to take a stand\u201d against the climate emergency, on a yacht, but she stresses that it was a necessary journey for her. \u201cThe ground is still shaking\u201d Greta Thunberg is addressing the public at a press conference at the marina in New York. Her first words were: \u201cWell, all of this is very overwhelming.\u201d She added that, having just got off the boat: \u201cThe ground is still shaking.\u201d She is saying the climate crisis is the biggest calamity humankind has ever faced. \u201cWe need to stand together and take action because otherwise it might be too late. Let\u2019s not wait any longer, let\u2019s do it now.\u201d Greta Thunberg arrives in the Big Apple To cheers and applause, 16-year-old Greta Thunberg disembarked moments ago from the yacht that carried her across the Atlantic and she is now getting ready to address the public. A small platform has been prepared for her near where the boat tied up at the marina in lower Manhattan, amid light rain. Her official arrival was later than expected mainly because the wind dropped. But she\u2019s here now! She\u2019s on dry land. New York arrival - official! Go Greta! She close enough that she\u2019s waving to people on shore now, amid encouraging shouts of \u201cGo, Greta!\u201d and cheers from the gathered crowd. She\u2019s docked. She\u2019s here. Still on board. It\u2019s a fact One of Greta Thunberg\u2019s pithiest points on the environment is: \u201cMany people think that climate change is an opinion. But it\u2019s not an opinion, it\u2019s a fact.\u201d Paging Donald Trump, who skipped the climate crisis and Amazon rainforest talks at the G7 meeting earlier this week in France. Big Apple backdrop Here\u2019s a cool pic, despite the murky conditions prevailing in New York today. Almost there Greta tweets: Pricking the conscience Even as pro-environmental types cheer Greta Thunberg\u2019s arrival in New York ahead of addressing the United Nations general assembly meeting next month, climate and water scientist Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute, in Oakland, California, is prodding consciences. He tweets: Gin palace Here\u2019s a yacht tied up next to where Greta Thunberg\u2019s sailing boat will dock shortly, per a reporter\u2019s tweet. One small dot Here\u2019s an even better pic that shows a diminutive Greta Thunberg on the prow of the yacht that\u2019s carried her across the Atlantic, prominently showing it\u2019s message that the climate crisis must be addressed immediately: \u201cA race we must win\u201d. Sustainable development goals As Thunberg\u2019s yacht rounded the Statue of Liberty it was met by a flotilla of 17 support boats, each with its sail printed with a message spelling out a recommended sustainable development goal, as promoted by the United Nations in its \u201cblueprint\u201d for a better future for the planet and humankind. These include combating discrimination and promoting peace, as well as using less plastic, not wasting food or water, using public transportation and vaccinating children against diseases, and similar aims. Here is Greta\u2019s tweet about it: Press conference After she steps ashore, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is expected to give a press conference. As expected, there are lots of journalists waiting at the marina in lower Manhattan for her yacht to tie up. But there are also lots of fellow activists, too, young and old, lining the railings of the nearby promenade overlooking New York\u2019s harbor and crowded in the area where she will sail in the last few feet and set foot on dry land after two weeks on the ocean wave. She is good with pithy messages as well as longer-form reasoning on why people and their governments need to take comprehensive action to tackle the climate emergency. She\u2019s accused world leaders of acting like irresponsible children. And she didn\u2019t get seasick, apparently, despite heavy weather and ferocious swells in the Atlantic on her way to the US. So we\u2019ll see what New York makes of her, as well as the United Nations as it gets ready for its annual gathering here, the general assembly. Thunberg rounds the Statue of Liberty. Sailing into New York In Greta\u2019s own words. Asperger\u2019s Thunberg, 16, is very up front (ie it\u2019s part of her Twitter bio) about the fact that she has been diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s, which is on the autism spectrum. In this piece, the British writer Ian Birrell says the Swedish teen is teaching the wider world as much about this condition as she is about the climate crisis. Past the Statue of Liberty The Guardian\u2019s reporter on the spot in lower Manhattan, Oliver Milman, tells me Greta Thunberg\u2019s yacht has just rounded the Statue of Liberty. Weather conditions are pretty murky in New York today, but she\u2019s on her way in. A flotilla of supporting boats has gone out to meet her. The teenage climate activist is on the brink of setting foot in the US after her voyage across the Atlantic. Meet the parents Before Greta Thunberg\u2019s activism gave her international recognition, she was best known as the daughter of Swedish entertainers, my Guardian colleague here in New York, Lauren Aratani, writes. Her mother, Malena Ernman, is a popular Swedish opera star. Malena has performed internationally, including in Moscow for the 2009 Eurovision competition, representing Sweden. For the competition, she sang \u201cLa Voix\u201d, a song with mostly French lyrics, which she wrote herself. Ernman is married to Svante Thunberg, Greta\u2019s father. A former actor, Svante Thunberg said that he gave up his acting career to raise his two daughters and accommodate his wife\u2019s traveling for her career. Here\u2019s a family pic of Greta as a young girl. Thunberg\u2019s grandfather, Olof, is also a Swedish actor. Svante was reportedly named after Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius who was the first scientist to calculate how carbon dioxide emissions lead to greenhouse gas effects. Greta\u2019s parents say their daughter\u2019s persistence about the climate crisis completely changed their lifestyle. When Greta was nine, she started to learn the extent of the problem and became depressed. She turned to her parents with her frustration that people seemed simultaneously concerned about climate crisis but did not do anything to change it. Convinced by their daughter\u2019s arguments, Svante and Malena changed their lifestyles, going vegan and refusing to take flights \u2013 a surprising announcement for Malena who often flew for performances. Svante said the changes were natural, given that the family has always care about human rights. \u201cWhile we were saying all these things about taking care of our fellow men, we were flying around, eating meat, buying things, driving a car, having two homes,\u201d Svante said at the 2018 UN Conference on Climate Change in 2018. \u201cThen we realized that we of course are a huge part of the problem, in fact, we were part of the problem. Greta could not get around that, and it made her upset. \u2026 She told us we had to change.\u201d Running Dry Water, water everywhere around New York City, where we are waiting for Greta Thunberg\u2019s arrival breathlessly (literally, actually, as the wind has dropped, my colleague downtown tells me, which will affect her ability to enter the marina in lower Manhattan under sail). But not so much water in many other parts these days, especially Central America. Xiye Bastida, who was talking earlier to the Guardian\u2019s environment reporter Oliver Milman, as both hung out on the dock near New York harbor waiting for the yacht, told him that her family fled here from Mexico as a result of severe drought in that region. She is now a passionate climate activist and has been inspired by Thunberg\u2019s focused campaigning. Bastida said she wants Thunberg\u2019s message to \u201cwake people up\u201d in the US to the climate emergency. But not just worldwide, here in the US, too, where no amount of climate crisis denial will diminish the effects of ever-stronger hurricanes, crippling south-west drought, repeated flooding and ever-rising temperatures that are more than just weather fluctuations, experts say. \u201cThe problem is that the climate crisis follows you around everywhere,\u201d Bastida said. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s recent series on the effect of climate-change affected water shortages in Central America, Running Dry. Waste of time to meet Trump - Thunberg When Greta Thunberg was setting sail from Plymouth (in England, not New England) on August 14, my colleague on the spot that day, the Guardian\u2019s global environment editor Jonathan Watts, reported that the activist didn\u2019t intend to talk to with US president Donald Trump, even were the opportunity to present itself. The teenager said it would be a waste of time because Trump hasn\u2019t been persuaded by the experts he has already spoken to, on the topic of the climate crisis, which he has declared a hoax. \u201cI\u2019m not that special. I can\u2019t convince everyone,\u201d Thunberg said at the time. Here\u2019s Watts\u2019s full report from that day. The voyage has been a demonstration of her declared values, he wrote, which revolve around reducing emissions. A flight to New York from Europe would have been much quicker, but it would pump close to 1,000kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Conventional cruise ships often have an even bigger footprint. Instead, Thunberg \u2013 along with her father, a cameraman and a two-man crew \u2013 are taking a zero carbon option. The Malizia II is a 60ft (18 meter) racing yacht that was built for round-the-world challenges and has just completed the Fastnet race, which runs every two years off the British coast. The yacht generates the power for lighting and communication through solar panels and underwater turbines. The racing team have removed sponsorship logos from the hull and emblazoned Greta\u2019s slogan \u201cUnite Behind the Science\u201d on the mainsail. Who\u2019s she? While enthusiastic crowds line the dock in the US where environmental activist and Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg will shortly arrive and disembark, some New Yorkers are non-plussed. One passerby just asked my colleague on the spot, Oliver Milman, if she\u2019s a solo round the world yachtswoman. Here\u2019s our swift Guardian Greta guide. Excitement grows The Guardian\u2019s environment reporter, Oliver Milman, is at the North Cove Marina in lower Manhattan waiting for Thunberg to arrive. It\u2019s within sight, theoretically, of the spectacular Statue of Liberty and the nearby historic processing center for immigrants of yore, the striking Ellis Island (now a museum), although Ollie reports that it\u2019s drizzling at the moment and these iconic landmarks are part shrouded in some light mist. There\u2019s a large glass-domed shopping mall next to the marina, which is stereotypical of America but not specifically of New York City, which on the whole eschews such emporia. Can\u2019t see Greta visiting that, somehow. There are also enormous yachts lining the marina. And it\u2019s all just a spit from what was known after September 11, 2001, as Ground Zero, ie the site of the World Trade Center that was felled by hijacked passenger jets in a terrorist attack that cost almost 3,000 lives. Crowds waiting for Thunberg\u2019s arrival are dominated by young, enthusiastic activists standing on the dock. Milman points out that \u201cIt\u2019s quite a remarkable reception for a teenager virtually unknown in the US when she started her school walkouts about a year ago\u201d in Sweden. Waiting for the tide More on that reference by Thunberg to \u201ctide allowing\u201d in terms of the exact time she\u2019s expected to tie up at one of the marinas in lower Manhattan. Low tide today is expected at 2PM local time (7PM BST in the UK). Conditions currently are rather murky, with visibility just 10 miles, although there is the prospect of some sunshine shortly, around the time she arrives, so let\u2019s hope that happens and keeps all the photographers and videographers happy as their images whizz around the world. Sea conditions are moderate, waves at just over a foot, with a light wind of just around 8mph, blowing out of the north-east out to sea and closer to SSE on land right now. The air pressure is falling, it\u2019s quite muggy actually, and the air temperature is a very warm 80F (26C). Compared with the weather the crew of her yacht have been contending with out in the Atlantic, this is - ahem - plain sailing. \u201cGreta has a posse\u201d Greta Thunberg tweeted earlier today, after anchoring off the Brooklyn seaside resort of Coney Island before dawn, that she would sail into a marina in Manhattan at 14.45PM local time (2.45PM BST in the UK) \u201ctide allowing\u201d. So that could obviously fluctuate forwards or backwards in time, and crowds gathering at the tip of Manhattan, where the city cedes to the harbor and the benign eye of the Statue of Liberty, are excited. My colleague Oliver Milman just talked to 17-year-old Xiye Bastida, there, who said she is originally from Mexico (Mexico, climate crisis, Greta - three topics guaranteed to upset Donald Trump) and is a big fan of Thunberg. \u201cEveryone knows Greta, we like that she\u2019s humble, she\u2019s just a child who wants a better future, who is basically like us, too,\u201d Bastida told Milman moments ago. Bastida was inspired by Thunberg\u2019s activism to organize her own climate strike, involving 600 fellow students at her New York City school. \u201cShe has a moral aspect to her message, that our generation will suffer the most. I hope she will raise the consciousness of climate change in the US - help wake people up,\u201d she said. Bastida\u2019s mobile phone carries a sticker saying: \u201cGreta has a posse\u201d. Hello to Guardian readers around the world. A brisk but excited New York welcome to our special live blog that will cover the imminent arrival in the Big Apple of Sweden\u2019s teenage environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg. This is Joanna Walters helming the blog from the Guardian\u2019s US headquarters in Manhattan while my colleague and environment reporter, Oliver Milman, has the salty breeze in his face at the tip of the island waiting for Thunberg to set foot on dry land after her zero-carbon crossing of the Atlantic. For the last few hours the yacht she sailed on has been anchored off southern Brooklyn, going through customs and immigration procedures, and \u201ctide allowing\u201d, it\u2019s expected to approach the city past the Statute of Liberty soon. A flotilla of supporters under sail are expected to intercept her near Liberty and escort her to a marina just on the west side of the tip of Manhattan, where the harbor meets the Hudson River.",

All of those mental facts should sit with them next game.\u201d The 24-year-old also hit back at Steve Smith after the Australian ramped up the personal duel between the pair by pointing out on Wednesday that Archer had not actually dismissed him yet during this series, even if he did rule him out of the Headingley Test with concussion after hitting him on the neck with a short ball during the second match of the series at Lord\u2019s. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t get him out if he wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Archer said. \u201cBut there\u2019ll be more than ample time to get him out. I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t get him out but if we don\u2019t get him out there\u2019s 10 other people we can get out and if he\u2019s stranded on 40 that\u2019s not helping his team too much. He can\u2019t do it all himself. We want to win the game. I\u2019m not here to get caught up in a contest with one man. I want to win the Ashes.\u201d Archer, who also played a starring role in England\u2019s World Cup win last month, also belittled Australian attempts to get under his skin during the Headingley run chase, the Barbados-born player falling for 15 when he was caught on the boundary trying to smash the off-spin of Nathan Lyon into the Western Terrace. \u201cIt was terrible chat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made me laugh. I think it was either Tim Paine or [Matthew] Wade when it was going off [checking his dismissal]. Someone said: \u2018That is a great shot, Jof.\u2019 If it did go for six it would have been. I thought I had messed the series up so I was very relieved we are still alive and fighting. It doesn\u2019t matter how many wickets we won by. It doesn\u2019t matter how we got there. The point was that we did.\u201d There was gratitude for Stokes, too, with Archer saying: \u201cYes, he did give us a second life in this series. Everyone would like to win the World Cup and the Ashes as well so there\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t go and do it now.\u201d As for Australia\u2019s batsmen, against whom he has taken 13 wickets at an average of 13.53 in his first two Tests, Archer said: \u201cWe might actually get them out for 67 \u2013 who knows? Everyone\u2019s been bowling well, everyone\u2019s got wickets, so that\u2019s good. It\u2019s not just one person taking all the wickets.\u201d Jimmy Anderson, England\u2019s record wicket-taker who is working his way back from the calf injury he sustained on the opening day of the series at Edgbaston, is also looking to return for the fourth Ashes Test at his home ground of Old Trafford. \u201cHopefully he can do his thing and we can be off the field a bit quicker,\u201d Archer said. The fast bowler also refused to confirm he had been given a painkilling injection for the side strain that affected him during the World Cup before bowling England\u2019s super over during the final against New Zealand at Lord\u2019s last month. \u201cSorry, but how does that coincide with anything that was going on?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I would say is that I\u2019m fully fit and I\u2019ve been that way from the start of the series.\u201d As for the atmosphere in England\u2019s dressing room during the Headingley run chase, Archer spoke of the moment when, with England needing two to win, Lyon bungled a simple run-out chance to dismiss Jack Leach. \u201cAll I can say is that that last game was special,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Lyon fumbled the run-out, you could hear a heartbeat in the dressing room. There were so many emotions flying around. When the scores were level, it was just a big cheer. At least we knew the series was not over!\u201d Specsavers is the official Test partner of the England cricket team",

      "bodyText": "The fires raging in the Brazilian Amazon are likely to intensify over the coming weeks, a leading environmental expert has warned, despite government claims the situation had been controlled. About 80,000 blazes have been detected in Brazil this year \u2013 more than half in the Amazon region \u2013 although on Saturday the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, claimed the situation was \u201creturning to normal\u201d. On Monday Brazil\u2019s defense minister, Fernando Azevedo e Silva, told reporters: \u201cThe situation is not straightforward but it\u2019s under control and already cooling down nicely.\u201d But in an article for Brazil\u2019s O Globo newspaper on Wednesday, one prominent forestry expert warned that the country\u2019s annual burning season had yet to fully play out and called for urgent steps to reduce the potential damage. \u201cThe worst of the fire is still to come,\u201d wrote Tasso Azevedo, a forest engineer and environmentalist who coordinates the deforestation monitoring group MapBiomas. Azevedo said many of the areas currently being consumed by flames were stretches of Amazon rainforest that had been torn down in the months of April, May and June. But areas deforested in July and August \u2013 when government monitoring systems detected a major surge in destruction \u2013 had yet to be torched. The Brazilian Amazon lost 1,114.8 sq km (430 sq miles) \u2013 an area equivalent to Hong Kong \u2013 in the first 26 days of August, according to preliminary data from the government\u2019s satellite monitoring agency. An area half the size of Philadelphia was reportedly lost in July, with Brazilian media denouncing an \u201cexplosion\u201d of devastation in the Amazon. Azevedo wrote: \u201cWhat we are experiencing is a genuine crisis which could become a tragedy foretold with much larger fires than the ones we are now seeing if they are not immediately halted.\u201d He called for urgent measures such as a crackdown on deforestation in indigenous territories and conservation units and outlawing deliberate burning in the Amazon until at least the end of October when the dry season ends. That warning came after more than 400 members of Brazil\u2019s environmental agency, Ibama, published a damning open letter about the state of environmental protection under Bolsonaro, a rightwing nationalist who took power in January vowing to open up the Amazon to development. In the letter to Ibama\u2019s president, Eduardo Bim, employees said they felt it was their duty to publicly voice their \u201cimmense concern\u201d about the direction environment protection was taking. \u201cThe rates of Amazon forest destruction will not be reduced unless a firm stand is taken against environmental crimes,\u201d they wrote. Campaigners accuse Bolsonaro\u2019s administration of hamstringing the very agency that should be fighting illegal deforestation and giving the green-light to environmental criminals with his pro-development rhetoric. On Wednesday Reuters reported that, despite the spike in deforestation, an elite squad of Ibama operatives \u2013 called the Grupo Especializado de Fiscaliza\u00e7\u00e3o or Specialized Inspection Group \u2013 had not been deployed to the Amazon once in 2019. At a summit of Amazon governors on Tuesday \u2013 supposedly convened to discuss responses to the fires \u2013 Bolsonaro repeatedly attacked environmentalists and indigenous activists who he claimed were holding back Brazil\u2019s economy. Many, though not all, of the Amazon governors backed Bolsonaro\u2019s vision for the region. \u201cThe Amazon is still on fire but Jair Bolsonaro has managed to show he is not alone,\u201d Bernardo Mello Franco wrote in O Globo on Wednesday. \u201cIn a meeting at the presidential palace, most of the region\u2019s governors also made it clear they couldn\u2019t give a monkey\u2019s about the forest.\u201d Bolsonaro confirmed on Wednesday that he would attend a meeting with other South American leaders in neighbouring Colombia on 6 September, in order to draw up a coordinated response to the crisis. The meeting, announced on Tuesday will seek to draw up a plan to protect the Amazon rainforest, which straddles Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana and Suriname. On Wednesday 18 global fashion brands including Timberland, Vans and The North Face were reported to have suspended leather purchases from Brazil over the crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Within hours of Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament, impromptu protests were being held in major city centres across the country, including in front of the Palace of Westminster in central London. Demonstrations were scheduled to be held from late afternoon onwards in areas including Manchester, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Birmingham, Liverpool, Bristol, Cambridge, Brighton, Durham, Milton Keynes and Chester. Protesters gathered at Commons Green, just outside Parliament, and marched towards Downing Street. Organisers claimed the crowd numbered in the thousands. The demonstrators described the move to suspend parliament as a coup and called for Johnson to resign. At one point, the traffic at Downing Street was at a standstill as protesters chanted \u201csave our democracy, stop the coup\u201d and sang \u201cNo one voted for Boris\u201d. Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green party, was one of many opposition politicians present. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re here to stand against Boris Johnson\u2019s coup. We have a representative democracy and by suspending parliament, you are removing people\u2019s democratic right.\u201d Speaking of the decision to prorogue, she said: \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve been expecting this for a while but I didn\u2019t think he would make such a brutal move that showed such a disregard for our parliamentary procedures.\u201d She added: \u201cI think what he has done is unite parts of the country who don\u2019t support a no-deal and his form of process that is denying democracy.\u201d Jane Keane, 54, said she had been protesting every day since Michael Gove announced the government would start making preparations for a no-deal. \u201cIt is a complete contradiction to what parliament has said three times. They\u2019ve said no deal is unacceptable. My understanding is parliament is sovereign not Boris Johnson.\u201d She said she did not have a history of activism , but as someone who has recently survived cancer she was terrified of the impact a no-deal Brexit will have on medical supplies. Michael Chessum, the national organiser for Another Europe is Possible, said: \u201cToday\u2019s protest was huge and exceeded all expectations. We got thousands at four hours\u2019 notice. We cannot rely on the judiciary or parliamentary process to save democracy \u2013 we need a mass movement of protest and civil disobedience.\u201d Andrew Lake, a 23-year-old actor, carried a sign that read: \u201cCall this a democracy?\u201d He said: \u201cI\u2019m here today to save democracy. I\u2019m not entirely surprised when he [Johnson] suspended parliament. I have been expecting it to happen. The fact it was expected doesn\u2019t make it any less of an outrage.\u201d Lake said he was fearful the country was heading towards no deal and called for article 50 to be extended or revoked. Emma Cooper, 28, a teaching assistant, said: \u201cI feel absolutely livid. I haven\u2019t been to a protest for a long time \u2026 What\u2019s happening in this country and the rightwing shift around the world is really worrying. I think Brexit is xenophobia extended to a bigger level.\u201d Meanwhile in Manchester, a growing crowd of around 250 protesters had gathered by around 6pm in Albert Square by the town hall. Many were armed with umbrellas, some in solidarity with Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protest, some to protect against the rain. They chanted \u201cstop the coup\u201d, with signs reading \u201cHands off\u201d and \u201cprotect our democracy\u201d.

Escalating debts allied to the council\u2019s refusal to grant planning permission for a new stadium dictated that Maidstone \u2013 whose owners had gambled on investing \u00a3400,000 on a patch of land on which they would not be allowed to build \u2013 were playing home matches at Dartford. The league rejected a proposal that the club relocate to Tyneside and merge with Newcastle Blue Star. Maidstone had spent beyond their means to win promotion to the Football League in 1989 and lacked an adequate ground. After folding, a new Maidstone were formed. This outfit almost went bust before Oliver Ash and Terry Casey took over in 2010. Maidstone\u2019s Gallagher Stadium opened in 2012 and they compete in the National League South.</p>\n    <p><b>Aldershot<br></b>Aldershot FC were elected to the Football League in 1932 and remained there until they were wound up in the high court in March 1992 and forced to resign. Laden with debt, the struggling fourth\u2011division club had been in deep financial difficulty and, during their final months, were unable to pay the players. A new entity called Aldershot Town were quickly built, beginning life in the Isthmian League division three returning to the League in 2008. In 2013 they were relegated from League Two and went into administration before being rescued by a takeover. They play in the National League.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Accrington Stanley<br></b>Accrington\u2019s resignation in March 1962 proved a real shock. Financial difficulties prompted by the purchase of a stand plunged them into severe trouble and they resigned from the league. The club spent four seasons in the Lancashire Combination before being disbanded. Accrington Stanley FC were formed in their place in 1968&nbsp;and won promotion to the Football League in 2006.

Escalating debts allied to the council\u2019s refusal to grant planning permission for a new stadium dictated that Maidstone \u2013 whose owners had gambled on investing \u00a3400,000 on a patch of land on which they would not be allowed to build \u2013 were playing home matches at Dartford. The league rejected a proposal that the club relocate to Tyneside and merge with Newcastle Blue Star. Maidstone had spent beyond their means to win promotion to the Football League in 1989 and lacked an adequate ground. After folding, a new Maidstone were formed. This outfit almost went bust before Oliver Ash and Terry Casey took over in 2010. Maidstone\u2019s Gallagher Stadium opened in 2012 and they compete in the National League South.</p>\n    <p><b>Aldershot<br></b>Aldershot FC were elected to the Football League in 1932 and remained there until they were wound up in the high court in March 1992 and forced to resign. Laden with debt, the struggling fourth\u2011division club had been in deep financial difficulty and, during their final months, were unable to pay the players. A new entity called Aldershot Town were quickly built, beginning life in the Isthmian League division three returning to the League in 2008. In 2013 they were relegated from League Two and went into administration before being rescued by a takeover. They play in the National League.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Accrington Stanley<br></b>Accrington\u2019s resignation in March 1962 proved a real shock. Financial difficulties prompted by the purchase of a stand plunged them into severe trouble and they resigned from the league. The club spent four seasons in the Lancashire Combination before being disbanded. Accrington Stanley FC were formed in their place in 1968&nbsp;and won promotion to the Football League in 2006.

The energy challenger brand told its staff on Wednesday that it has agreed to buy Co-op Energy, which supplies gas and electricity to about 300,000 homes. Octopus, which supplies 850,000 customers, is expected to confirm early on Thursday that the deal will nudge its business past 1 million customers after only four years in the market. The deal, thought to be worth more than \u00a330m, propels Octopus to within a whisker of rival supplier Bulb Energy, which supplies 1.4 million customers and is the UK\u2019s fastest growing new supplier. It follows a flurry of deals within the energy market which is beginning to consolidate after a flood of new suppliers joined the market in recent years, many of which have proved financially unstable. Co-Op Energy snapped up 160,000 customers from GB Energy Supply after it collapsed in 2016, and then gained another 130,000 customers after its takeover of Flow Energy last year. The company, part of the Midcounties Co-op, has since run into financial trouble. It revealed deepening losses earlier this year in the Co-op\u2019s financial report, which hinted that the supplier might be sold to protect the wider business. Octopus Energy, which is owned by Octopus Group, is also loss-making but has the full support of its investment fund owner which has ambitions to grow the business to compete with the big six. Octopus Group was an early backer of the property site Zoopla and backs Big Gym, Secret Escapes and Eve mattresses through its investment arm Octopus Ventures. Its fast-growing energy supplier bought smaller rival Affect Energy last September and took on the customers of failed energy start-up Iresa in December last year.

Nearly 90% of the ship\u2019s lower deck \u2013 including the areas where the crew ate and slept \u2013 were accessible to the vehicle.

      "bodyText": "Evidence recovered from beneath the bitter cold of Canada\u2019s Arctic Ocean will shed new light on the final days the ill-fated expedition of the British polar explorer Sir John Franklin, who disappeared with his crew in 1845. Parks Canada and Inuit researchers announced on Wednesday the results of a study of the HMS Terror \u2013 including \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d new images from within the incredibly well-preserved ship \u2013 and raised the possibility that logs and maps have remained intact and legible after nearly 170 years underwater. Over several weeks in early August, the researchers launched 3D-mapping technology to survey the wreck site off the the coast of King William Island in Nunavut. For the first time ever, the team was also able to make seven trips inside the ship by piloting a remotely operated vehicle through the ship. Nearly 90% of the ship\u2019s lower deck \u2013 including the areas where the crew ate and slept \u2013 were accessible to the vehicle. In total, the expedition was able to study 20 separate rooms. \u201cThe impression we witnessed when exploring the HMS Terror is of a ship only recently deserted by its crew, seemingly forgotten by the passage of time,\u201d said Ryan Harris, a senior archeologist for Parks Canada, in a statement. In 1845, the HMS Erebus and HMS Terror departed England in search of the coveted Northwest Passage. But the famed and closely watched expedition ended in disaster, with all 129 crew members succumbing to the hostile elements of the Arctic. Recent excavations on nearby islands suggest a combination of scurvy, hypothermia \u2013 and potentially cannibalism \u2013 killed the crew after they abandoned the two stranded vessels. Multiple expeditions to recover the ships and the remains of the crew proved futile. For generations, Inuit oral history has told of the two wrecked ships and stranded sailors. Long ignored by western archaeologists, the history was vindicated when Inuit historians helped uncover the final resting sites of the Erebus in 2014, and the Terror in 2016. Since the monumental discovery, Parks Canada has set about studying both ships in detail, with the aim of better understanding the lives of those aboard \u2013 and the final months of the voyage. From within the wreck, Capt Francis Crozier\u2019s cabin remains the most intact. Only his sleeping quarters, which are behind a shut door, are inaccessible. The location itself, beneath the frigid Arctic waters, has been critical to preserving much of the ship. The water temperature, and lack of natural light, has prevented the degradation many of the items, including crockery and and navigation too.

Boris Johnson must assume he is going to escape parliament and I don\u2019t think he is.\u201d A humble address is binding and can be used by the opposition to express its strength of feeling to the government or request that it hand over documents. It has rarely been deployed in the past 200 years but Labour successfully used it in 2017 to make a direct appeal to the Queen that the government make public its economic impact assessments of Brexit. Grieve said he and colleagues working to stop no deal would be working tirelessly before parliament returned on 3 September on a plan to show their unhappiness with prorogation. He also said Johnson was aware that parliament as a whole had no desire for a suspension during the conference recess period. \u201cWe are in the middle of a national crisis. The prime minister knows very well that the Commons was resolved not to break for the conference recess. Normal prorogation is five, six days at most and his decision to go around and do this shows his reckless disregard for the way the UK functions. It is certainly not illegal but it\u2019s constitutionally wrong.\u201d",

A free-trade agreement with the European Union would open up a market of half a billion people. In addition, Josh Frydenberg, the treasurer, should also be prepared to \u201csacrifice projections of the budget returning to surplus given likely tax revenue shocks and the need to increase spending to stimulate the economy\u201d. The government and regulators should also redouble efforts to ensure that Australia\u2019s banks are equipped with sufficient reserves to withstand any China shock to their balance sheets. Eleanor Creagh, at Saxo Capital Markets in Sydney said China\u2019s economy was at a crossroads. \u201cChina has seen credit growth at extreme levels but there has been a delveraging campaign going on which has had an impact on economic growth. It\u2019s a fine line for China right now between deleveraging and maintaining growth levels.\u201d Although she sees any significant China downturn as a prospect for the longer term, Creagh said policymakers and investors in Australia should have the possibility of a hard landing on their radar. \u201cIt goes without saying that it would not just be Australia that would feel it. The knock on effect would be for the whole global economy. Australia would therefore feel a double hit as a small, open economy. And the RBA doesn\u2019t have as much ammo as they had in 2008 to fight the next crisis.\u201d",

Anna is an aid worker, recently returned home after more than a decade in south-east Asia and struggling to settle back into life in Melbourne.

In rural Thailand, Mukda, a single mother, struggles to support her extended family.</p> <p>The three women and their families\u2019 lives become intimately intertwined in the unsettling and extraordinary process of trying to bring a child into the world across boundaries of class, culture and nationality.

They\u2019re bound for Australia, a mythical land of sunshine and kangaroos, steady jobs and brighter futures.</p> <p>The passengers set off full of hope, but something sinister has followed them aboard. In the ensuing chaos, three unlikely people are thrown together: a nine-year-old deaf boy who\u2019s the sole witness to a violent crime; a nightclub singer who\u2019s left her day job under dubious circumstances; and an anxious schoolteacher with a crush on a handsome sailor.</p> <p>I wanted to write a cracking tale that also touches on some big themes: migration, exploitation, belonging. Despite the high body count, the story is driven by love \u2013 both the bone-deep love of blood ties, and the unexpected devotion that can flourish between strangers.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>The Broken Shore by Peter Temple. I love Temple\u2019s spare, poetic style, the hard-bitten tenderness of his characters, his sharp eye for detail and place, and the way he transcends genre.

In the wake of the MeToo movement, I woke up to the global howls of distress from millions of women. This book is, therefore, both a personal investigation (read: mea culpa) and a deep examination of patriarchy and misogyny and how the models of masculinity that have been passed down through the ages have caused so much damage, not only to women, but to men and children as well.</p> <p>The central hope within the book is not to tell women what to think or feel \u2013 men have been doing that for centuries. Rather it is to invite other men to reflect on the ways in which a patriarchal system has shaped and damaged all of us, and to consider ways of transforming our ideas of \u201cmanhood\u201d so as to usher in a better world.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>I read over 80 books \u2013 some more deeply than others \u2013 during the course of researching and writing my own book. Arguably, the most powerful of these books was Misogyny: The World\u2019s Oldest Prejudice written by Jack Holland, the late Irish novelist, poet and journalist who captured in shocking detail the ancient and contemporary attitudes towards women that have inflicted so much damage.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>I\u2019m currently reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/24/its-like-you-go-to-abuse-school-how-domestic-violence-always-follows-the-same-script\">Jess Hill\u2019s See What You Made Me Do </a>and will then be plunging into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/03/the-good-people-by-hannah-kent-review\">Hannah Kent\u2019s The Good People</a>.

Fleeing a post-Brexit UK ravaged by sickness and recession, a group of workers boards a migrant labour vessel. They\u2019re bound for Australia, a mythical land of sunshine and kangaroos, steady jobs and brighter futures. The passengers set off full of hope, but something sinister has followed them aboard. In the ensuing chaos, three unlikely people are thrown together: a nine-year-old deaf boy who\u2019s the sole witness to a violent crime; a nightclub singer who\u2019s left her day job under dubious circumstances; and an anxious schoolteacher with a crush on a handsome sailor. I wanted to write a cracking tale that also touches on some big themes: migration, exploitation, belonging. Despite the high body count, the story is driven by love \u2013 both the bone-deep love of blood ties, and the unexpected devotion that can flourish between strangers. What were you reading while you wrote it? The Broken Shore by Peter Temple. I love Temple\u2019s spare, poetic style, the hard-bitten tenderness of his characters, his sharp eye for detail and place, and the way he transcends genre. This book is both page-turner and literary tour de force, so a daunting example of what I aspired to do. What will you read next? Act of Grace by Anna Krien (out in October). Anna is an absolute master, a writer of huge insight, compassion and intelligence, and someone who truly has the golden touch: she excels at long-form journalism, creative non-fiction, short fiction and poetry, so I can\u2019t wait to read her first novel. David Leser Women, Men and the Whole Damn Thing Allen &amp; Unwin Tell us about your book. My book is an attempt to look at the historical causes of the most pervasive form of violence on the planet today: violence against women. In the wake of the MeToo movement, I woke up to the global howls of distress from millions of women. This book is, therefore, both a personal investigation (read: mea culpa) and a deep examination of patriarchy and misogyny and how the models of masculinity that have been passed down through the ages have caused so much damage, not only to women, but to men and children as well. The central hope within the book is not to tell women what to think or feel \u2013 men have been doing that for centuries. Rather it is to invite other men to reflect on the ways in which a patriarchal system has shaped and damaged all of us, and to consider ways of transforming our ideas of \u201cmanhood\u201d so as to usher in a better world. What were you reading while you wrote it? I read over 80 books \u2013 some more deeply than others \u2013 during the course of researching and writing my own book. Arguably, the most powerful of these books was Misogyny: The World\u2019s Oldest Prejudice written by Jack Holland, the late Irish novelist, poet and journalist who captured in shocking detail the ancient and contemporary attitudes towards women that have inflicted so much damage. What will you read next? I\u2019m currently reading Jess Hill\u2019s See What You Made Me Do and will then be plunging into Hannah Kent\u2019s The Good People. Having just returned from County Clare in Ireland \u2013 where the visible and invisible words are often given equal weight \u2013 I\u2019m looking forward to delving into Hannah\u2019s gothic tale of a 19th century Irish village where fairies and folklore loom large in the collective imagination.",

This is not good news, given the OECD released a report into household disposable income which confirms that Australian living standards have flatlined for over five years at a time when other nations have seen their household incomes improve strongly. It shows that all the good work done during the GFC has been completely wasted. The March quarter GDP figures were pretty dire \u2013 the worst annual growth for a decade, the first time since 1983 that GDP per capita had fallen in three consecutive quarters. One reason for that weak performance was the slowdown in construction work, which unfortunately shows no sign of abating. The latest construction work figures, released on Wednesday by the Bureau of Statistics, show that the volume of both private and public construction has now fallen for four straight quarters: Private sector construction is down 8% on where it was a year ago, and public sector work is down 14%. So while we still have to wait for the trade figures, and other data such as capital expenditure, to get a fuller picture of what the GDP figures will show, the signs are not great that the second quarter of this year saw much improvement. And that is a problem because, as I have been noting for some time, real household disposable income per capita has been either flat or falling for around seven years now. While the ABS measures \u201creal net national disposable income per capita\u201d it does not actually provide a measure for household disposable incomes. This has meant the national income figure, which is commonly suggested as being a good measure of economic health or even living standards, gets prominence while the household income figure does not. The problem with this is that good profit figures can obscure the fact that households are not doing any better. But with a bit of work with the data you can calculate a figure for household disposable incomes, which has shown that for a long time now, the real growth in national income is to companies, not to households. And so it was with interest that I read the release on Tuesday by the OECD which was headlined \u201cOECD household income growth continued to outpace GDP growth in first quarter of 2019\u201d. The report noted that real household income per capita, \u201cwhich provides a better picture of changes in households\u2019 economic wellbeing than real GDP growth per capita\u201d had \u201caccelerated to 0.6% in the OECD area in the first quarter of 2019, compared with 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2018.\u201d So good news! And then you look at Australia\u2019s figures. The OECD estimates our real household disposable income fell 0.1% in the first quarter of this year and is down 0.8% on where it was last year. The data highlights just how quickly we have fallen back to the field. Whereas from 2007 to the end of 2013 the real disposable income of Australian households outgrew the OECD average in 18 out of 27 quarters (ie two thirds of the time), since then in just five out of 22 quarters we have done so. Since the start of 2014, the annual growth of Australian real household disposable income has always been lower than the OECD average. That\u2019s five and a half years of underperformance: The faltering of our living standards compared with the rest of the OECD is made clear when we look at the growth since 2007. You can see that we soared through the GFC compared with everyone else, and yet we have utterly failed to take advantage, and now over the past 12 years the OECD has on average seen household incomes grow by more than ours: What an utter waste. All of the good work avoiding recession wasted through blowing the recovery. And until wages growth improves we are unlikely to see any reversing of the situation. But what the data also highlights is that Australia has a uniquely bad issue with underemployment \u2013 the very thing that is a main driver of our weak wages growth.

Major generators were less likely to invest in new power plants while the government was underwriting their competitors and the underwritten projects were likely to end up competing with the commonwealth-funded Snowy Hydro 2.0 project.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just a bad idea, it\u2019s worse than that, because it undermines the reliability obligation and the market signal encouraging new investment,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Angus Taylor is genuinely concerned but I don\u2019t think this is going to solve his problem.

      "bodyText": "The outspoken power baron Trevor St Baker has urged the Coalition to avoid being a \u201cgovernment of inaction\u201d on energy policy and called for the Liddell power station to be transformed into an \u201cexclusive baseload power precinct\u201d. It comes as companies that were shortlisted for taxpayer underwriting for energy generation projects before the May election continue to wait for information about how the program will work or whether they will receive government support. St Baker has two power generation projects on the shortlist of 12 unveiled in March, including a pumped hydro project in South Australia and a coal upgrade at Lake Macquarie being pursued by his company, Delta Energy. He said the underwriting process was \u201ca slow process\u201d because \u201cthere are bureaucrats working out the order of things\u201d. Speaking on condition of anonymity, some other energy company managers with projects on the shortlist expressed frustration that they did not yet know how many the government planned to support, how those projects would be selected or what form of support the underwriting would take. They said they believed the program had been announced ahead of the election without key decisions having been made before about how it would work on the assumption the Coalition was unlikely to win and the policy would not go ahead. Tony Wood, the energy program director at the Grattan Institute, said he understood the government was struggling to turn what had been a pre-election thought bubble into reality. He said the plan for the program now appeared quite different to the recommendation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which suggested the government provide certainty for debt financing to help new companies that already had deals with customers enter the market. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, said work on the underwriting program was progressing. He said the shortlist had identified projects at different stages of maturity that were designed to increase competition and supply and put downward pressure on prices. He said a recent announcement that the government would spend $40m on grants for pumped hydro energy storage projects had been made to support the first underwriting projects in South Australia. Three of the 12 shortlisted projects were pumped hydro in that state. \u201cFurther announcements will be made as the Commonwealth reaches agreements on support for individual projects,\u201d Taylor said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The government is working on the policy mechanism that will underpin both the shortlisted projects and new generation capacity beyond the shortlist later this year. Officials say, when it comes to the shortlist, the government has prioritised projects nearing the financing phase. Wood said the underwriting program could work against the government\u2019s goals of ensuring there was enough dispatchable electricity and helping cut power bills. Major generators were less likely to invest in new power plants while the government was underwriting their competitors and the underwritten projects were likely to end up competing with the commonwealth-funded Snowy Hydro 2.0 project. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a bad idea, it\u2019s worse than that, because it undermines the reliability obligation and the market signal encouraging new investment,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Angus Taylor is genuinely concerned but I don\u2019t think this is going to solve his problem. It risks a future where people will not invest without government underwriting.\u201d The Australian Industry Group last year said underwriting could leave taxpayers exposed to liabilities \u201cwith a net present value of billions of dollars\u201d. St Baker said the shortlisted projects he was pursuing would make a contribution to Australia\u2019s energy needs but the main game was a replacement for Liddell in New South Wales and additional baseload capacity in Victoria. He said he wished the governments in NSW and Canberra \u201cwould work out either extending Liddell or selling it to someone who will extend it until a replacement can be built\u201d. He said he was \u201cbiding time to see whether we\u2019ve got a government of action or a government of inaction\u201d. \u201cI think making Liddell an exclusive baseload power precinct and paying all the existing generators for spinning reserve that they\u2019ve never been paid for could give AGL or any purchaser of Liddell a better business case to keep it going for as long as it can keep going, and not retiring it until it is replaced by a like for like baseload plant providing 24/7 power,\u201d he said.",

It appealed to his drama nerd side: you got to create your own superhero or supervillain and interact with other characters, to your own script. He began lifting weights in a bid to become equally larger-than-life \u2013 a struggle without the aid of steroids \u2013 and then started training with Red Hot Ricky Diamond. His first fight, in 2000, was at a street fair in Fairfield, north-east Melbourne, outside a chicken shop. \u201cI had two minutes in the ring,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I was sold.\u201d</p> <p>He came up with the name KrackerJak for onomatopoeic reasons \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s like stomping on a plastic cup\u201d \u2013 and decided his alter ego should be the loose-cannon underdog. And, as the underdog, KrackerJak should suffer. He takes inspiration from Ash Williams, the luckless antihero of the Evil Dead horror films and Stan series. Even when Ash transforms from victim to avenger, he\u2019s constantly covered in his own blood, often by his own clumsy hand.</p> <p>\u201cIn wrestling, there\u2019s this weird miasma of consent,\u201d Mann explains. \u201cSo when Mad Dog [McCrea] says, \u2018I want you to attack me with a box cutter\u2019, I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, sure.\u2019 He said it\u2019s OK and I\u2019m willing to inflict the violence upon him that he needs.\u201d</p> <p>Mann\u2019s fun came to an abrupt end \u2013 or, at least, to an abrupt hiatus \u2013 in what turned out to be KrackerJak\u2019s last match, aptly titled Final Battle. That week, he\u2019d hammered 1,200 nails through plywood to build a bed of nails, ordered 40 packets of thumbtacks from Woolworths and prepped his weapons, but he was feeling oddly unenthused. Call it a premonition, but once at Thornbury Theatre, there was none of the usual slapping himself in the face to psych himself up. He felt like he was walking through mud.</p> <p>Mann and his opponent, Lochy \u201cLoverboy\u201d Hendricks, had arranged a few favourite manoeuvres, but the DVD player was a new idea \u2013 untested, because who wants a dry run of being smashed with four kilos of steel? He\u2019d told Hendricks to hit him until he went down \u2013 although, having a theatrical background, he had privately decided on the rule of three, plus one more as an exclamation mark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de5d0c83ffe81a1f92d1c8c525b543ec2aeca640\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de5d0c83ffe81a1f92d1c8c525b543ec2aeca640/0_0_4854_3689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018He\u2019d hammered 1,200 nails through plywood to build a bed of nails, ordered 40 packets of thumbtacks from Woolworths and prepped his weapons.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"760\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He\u2019d hammered 1,200 nails through plywood to build a bed of nails, ordered 40 packets of thumbtacks from Woolworths and prepped his weapons.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cory Lockwood Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first time the DVD player came down, it rattled him. The fourth time, his brain rang. It took another month for his balance to go. MRI scans revealed post-concussion brain damage that had affected his body\u2019s ability to tell which way is up. His rehab has followed the same procedures as that of a stroke patient, trying to rewrite the neural pathways. Disaster struck again a few months ago, when the anterior cruciate ligament around his knee joint snapped; his most painful injury yet. He\u2019s gutted no cameras were rolling, but at least he\u2019s fashioned himself a barbed-wire walking stick.</p> <p>Where do injured wrestlers go, other than to one kind of rehab or another? Sometimes they\u2019re relegated to the sidelines, as valets or managers or commentators. Sometimes they get into Jesus or porn.</p> <p>Mann\u2019s drawn on his arts background to get creative with suffering. He\u2019s developed some performance-art routines for burlesque clubs, such as The Twelve Unnecessarily Violent Days of Christmas, in which he repeatedly stapled his body. Then there\u2019s the Painful Pollock, for art spaces, whereby he swings upside down, slices open his face and drip-bleeds on to paper. These activities match the transcendence of pain in the wrestling ring and he quite enjoys decontextualising violence in this way, removing it from the arena of imminent threat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/01/spandex-snobbery-liberal-elite-wrestling-working-class\">Spandex snobbery smackdown: why the liberal elite snubs wrestling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, times are changing in Australia\u2019s wrestling scene. Academies are springing up \u2013 such as that of Melbourne City Wrestling, for whom Mann teaches a promo class, since the videos in which challenges are issued are a longstanding tradition \u2013 and promoters are teaming up with breweries and music venues, broadening the reach.

      "bodyText": "Alex Mann positions my phone on a Melbourne pub table, hits record and leans forward. I press a staple gun flush against his forehead. \u201cYou ready?\u201d \u201cYep,\u201d he says, squeezing his eyes shut. I fire a staple into his skull and he groans, hams it up a bit, then digs it out with my car key. It\u2019s as though packing a staple remover would be against wrestler protocol. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t my idea, but belatedly I wonder if I should have participated in this. Mann has a brain injury from being repeatedly coshed with a DVD player while wrestling as his alter ego, KrackerJak, at the end of 2017. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a difference,\u201d he assures me. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to get hurt taking the body slam than you are stapling yourself. It\u2019s all just meat.\u201d Mann is a hardcore wrestler, which means his fights are known as death matches. In these sadistic soap operas, opponents use dustbins, ladders, trestle tables and other repurposed household objects to inflict ultraviolence upon one another. (As philosopher Roland Barthes observed in his 1957 anthology of essays, Mythologies, wrestling is a spectacle with suffering at its core.) With the staple gun, Mann is demonstrating that such antics are far more painful outside of the \u201ctheatre in the round\u201d, as he calls it. In the real world, endorphins are slow to flow. Growing up in country Victoria, Mann gawked at the pumped-up heroes of fantasy and action movies. \u201cYou don\u2019t read the campiness when you\u2019re six,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, bad dudes in leather. What a tough guy. Look at that big moustache. Look how big their chests are.\u201d Eventually he discovered wrestling via a Super Nintendo game, which included a booklet of the real-life Wrestlemania wrestlers. It appealed to his drama nerd side: you got to create your own superhero or supervillain and interact with other characters, to your own script. He began lifting weights in a bid to become equally larger-than-life \u2013 a struggle without the aid of steroids \u2013 and then started training with Red Hot Ricky Diamond. His first fight, in 2000, was at a street fair in Fairfield, north-east Melbourne, outside a chicken shop. \u201cI had two minutes in the ring,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I was sold.\u201d He came up with the name KrackerJak for onomatopoeic reasons \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s like stomping on a plastic cup\u201d \u2013 and decided his alter ego should be the loose-cannon underdog. And, as the underdog, KrackerJak should suffer. He takes inspiration from Ash Williams, the luckless antihero of the Evil Dead horror films and Stan series. Even when Ash transforms from victim to avenger, he\u2019s constantly covered in his own blood, often by his own clumsy hand. \u201cIn wrestling, there\u2019s this weird miasma of consent,\u201d Mann explains. \u201cSo when Mad Dog [McCrea] says, \u2018I want you to attack me with a box cutter\u2019, I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, sure.\u2019 He said it\u2019s OK and I\u2019m willing to inflict the violence upon him that he needs.\u201d Mann\u2019s fun came to an abrupt end \u2013 or, at least, to an abrupt hiatus \u2013 in what turned out to be KrackerJak\u2019s last match, aptly titled Final Battle. That week, he\u2019d hammered 1,200 nails through plywood to build a bed of nails, ordered 40 packets of thumbtacks from Woolworths and prepped his weapons, but he was feeling oddly unenthused. Call it a premonition, but once at Thornbury Theatre, there was none of the usual slapping himself in the face to psych himself up. He felt like he was walking through mud. Mann and his opponent, Lochy \u201cLoverboy\u201d Hendricks, had arranged a few favourite manoeuvres, but the DVD player was a new idea \u2013 untested, because who wants a dry run of being smashed with four kilos of steel? He\u2019d told Hendricks to hit him until he went down \u2013 although, having a theatrical background, he had privately decided on the rule of three, plus one more as an exclamation mark. The first time the DVD player came down, it rattled him. The fourth time, his brain rang. It took another month for his balance to go. MRI scans revealed post-concussion brain damage that had affected his body\u2019s ability to tell which way is up. His rehab has followed the same procedures as that of a stroke patient, trying to rewrite the neural pathways. Disaster struck again a few months ago, when the anterior cruciate ligament around his knee joint snapped; his most painful injury yet. He\u2019s gutted no cameras were rolling, but at least he\u2019s fashioned himself a barbed-wire walking stick. Where do injured wrestlers go, other than to one kind of rehab or another? Sometimes they\u2019re relegated to the sidelines, as valets or managers or commentators. Sometimes they get into Jesus or porn. Mann\u2019s drawn on his arts background to get creative with suffering. He\u2019s developed some performance-art routines for burlesque clubs, such as The Twelve Unnecessarily Violent Days of Christmas, in which he repeatedly stapled his body. Then there\u2019s the Painful Pollock, for art spaces, whereby he swings upside down, slices open his face and drip-bleeds on to paper. These activities match the transcendence of pain in the wrestling ring and he quite enjoys decontextualising violence in this way, removing it from the arena of imminent threat. Meanwhile, times are changing in Australia\u2019s wrestling scene. Academies are springing up \u2013 such as that of Melbourne City Wrestling, for whom Mann teaches a promo class, since the videos in which challenges are issued are a longstanding tradition \u2013 and promoters are teaming up with breweries and music venues, broadening the reach. A new generation is hungrily seeking out pathways to World Wrestling Entertainment. They\u2019re more career-minded, less hedonistic. As a veteran of 20 years, Mann\u2019s skill set is appreciated. Throughout his recovery, he\u2019s kept his hand in with a variety of roles: co-host of ABC podcast Behind the Belt; sheriff of Melbourne\u2019s WrestleRock; mouthy manager of his brother Nick Mann, who goes by the ring name of Gore; and commentator for Melbourne City Wrestling, whose roster regularly packs out venues such as Thornbury Theatre. There may be fewer endorphins geeing him up, but occasionally he\u2019ll cop a cage door to the face by one of Gore\u2019s opponents, or break his finger grabbing someone\u2019s ankles through the ropes. Don\u2019t call it a comeback. Call it a run-up. \u2022 KrackerJak is commentating at MCW New Horizons on Saturday 31 August at Thornbury Theatre, Melbourne",

      "bodyText": "The federal government is pushing Unesco\u2019s world heritage committee to resolve how it will deal with the impact of climate change on world heritage properties, including the Great Barrier Reef. It comes ahead of the release of two government reports that are expected to project a poor outlook for the reef, the status of which will be reassessed by Unesco next year after previously avoiding an in danger listing. The world heritage committee has been reviewing its climate change policy and how countries should manage the impact of the climate crisis on the world heritage system. At a meeting of the committee in July, Australian representatives said climate change should not be used as the basis for an in danger listing for world heritage properties. \u201cWe would not expect to see propositions that climate change threats would form the basis for in danger listing individual properties because this is a global problem not amenable to site-level intervention,\u201d Stephen Oxley, from the environment and energy department, told the committee. \u201cBut we do need to find a way to recognise the reality that whole categories of world heritage properties globally are threatened by climate change \u2013 coral reefs, glaciers and mountain forests to name three examples.\u201d The world heritage committee\u2019s new climate policy, which will replace out-of-date guidelines from 2007, was due to be completed this year after a push from Australia but the document is still in development. At the July meeting, Oxley said Australia was disappointed by the slow progress and \u201cwe need a contemporary, evidence-based policy that sets the foundation for tractable climate action in the world heritage system\u201d. Climate change has been recognised as an existential threat to many world heritage properties. A 2017 Unesco report looked at the impact on coral reefs, which are especially vulnerable, and concluded that \u201cdrastic reductions\u201d in greenhouse gas emissions were \u201cthe only real solution\u201d if coral reefs were to stand a chance of survival. A spokesperson for the environment and energy department said the timing of Australia\u2019s intervention at the July meeting was not related to the world heritage committee\u2019s assessment of the Great Barrier Reef next year.

But environment groups say next year\u2019s Unesco review of the reef could serve as a test case for how the world heritage system will handle properties that are now visibly affected by climate change. Imogen Zethoven, the campaign director for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said it would \u201cbe a big moment\u201d for the committee because coral reefs were at the forefront of the climate crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s a test case because no other site they\u2019ve reviewed has been severely damaged already by climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cClimate change is the biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef.

Both are expected to show the outlook for the reef continues to be poor. Perceived delays to the release of the outlook report have worried some reef scientists, who privately say they are concerned the government might not respond appropriately to the \u201cdire\u201d recent data, while effectively mounting a public relations campaign about the condition of the reef ahead of the Unesco process. The statutory deadline for publication of the report is 12 September.

Parliamentarians stretch the limits of their vocabulary to express disbelief that this could happen in Britain, the \u201ccradle of democracy\u201d. Rewrite the history books, tear up Bagehot\u2019s The English Constitution, as the Queen and privy council sign the prorogation, neither the \u201cdignified parts\u201d not the \u201cefficient parts\u201d function any longer. This country that self-identified so smugly as stable, tolerant and moderate, with a crown to symbolise traditions honed down the centuries, is revealed as fissile, fragile and ferociously divided. A constitution that relied on gentlemanly governments\u2019 willingness to bow to parliament has evaporated, blown away now it\u2019s led by a man who doesn\u2019t give a damn for parliamentary sovereignty: taking back control is for him alone. He is ready to destroy anything that threatens his ambition. MPs will try to stop him proroguing them. Astonishingly, this unelected prime minister has so far only spent one day in the Commons under their scrutiny, and now, after five weeks away, he will face them for just one week before banishing them for an unprecedented further five weeks. They get just one tight week to rise up and rebel, when surely they will vote in great numbers against the prorogation the Speaker calls \u201ca constitutional outrage ... an offence against the democratic process and the rights of parliamentarians as the people\u2019s elected representatives\u201d. Johnson\u2019s riposte will be, \u201cSo what?\u201d Their vote has no legal standing. But as he sends MPs on their way with a flea in their ear, what will the public think of his insolent defiance of parliament? They will decide in the end \u2013 and they may not stand for it. The sense of violation of democracy reverberates everywhere. But what should civil servants do when power is seized in front of their eyes? Do they carry on obeying orders to drive the country into a no-deal Brexit disaster when they see parliament barred from that nation-changing decision? I asked Bob Kerslake, former head of the civil service, where their duty lies in this unprecedented situation. \u201cWe are reaching the point where the civil service must consider putting its stewardship of the country ahead of service to the government of the day,\u201d he said.

Malik was found guilty of three indecent assaults. Sharaz Hussain was found guilty of four indecent assaults. One of the two defendants who cannot be named was found guilty of two indecent assaults and the other found guilty of one indecent assault and two counts of child abduction. The verdicts mean that 20 men have now been convicted since the NCA took over the investigation of child sexual exploitation cases in Rotherham dating from between 1997 and 2013. The NCA was invited in following the Jay report, which shocked the nation in 2014 when it outlined the scale of the offending against children in the town.

      "body": "<p>The sun rises on day one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/venicefilmfestival\">Venice film festival</a> and it catches the guests in a delicate state. They\u2019re still sleepy, struggling to get their bearings and nursing hangovers from the welcome drinks the night before. These people require careful handling, a soothing introduction. Specifically, they need a film such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/18/venice-film-festival-to-open-with-kore-edas-the-truth-starring-catherine-deneuve\">Hirokazu Kore-eda\u2019s The Truth,</a> a well-appointed family melodrama that plays out among plumped cushions and expensive soft furnishings. These critics have only just rolled out of bed. Now, all at once, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re being rolled back again.</p> <p>Traditionally, Venice likes to open with a big Hollywood spectacular; with the one-take intensity of a film such as Birdman or the white-knuckle tension of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/alfonso-cuaron\">Alfonso Cuar</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/alfonso-cuaron\">\u00f3n</a>\u2019s Gravity. And yet, The Truth is the most refined, stately curtain-raiser I can recall seeing here, a picture that likes to stroll and murmur where others run and shout. It\u2019s handsome, it\u2019s amusing, it knows exactly where it\u2019s going. All that is missing is that crucial fifth gear.</p> <p>Shooting for the first time outside his native Japan, Kore-eda makes himself comfortable in a plush Paris home and coaxes impeccable performances from his regal French stars. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/catherinedeneuve\">Catherine Deneuve</a> headlines as Fabienne, a diva-ish actress, trailing clouds of glory (no stretch there, then). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliette-binoche\">Juliette Binoche</a> plays the shrewd, sceptical Lumir, so accustomed to living in her mother\u2019s shadow that she wears designer black to blend in. Fabienne has just published a self-serving memoir (The Truth) which glosses over the fractious relationship between mother and daughter and airbrushes out the nefarious means by which she landed her breakthrough role. \u201cI can\u2019t find any truth in here,\u201d snaps Lumir, although this is surely what happens when you have a parent who lies for a living.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzOn9GoXY7I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tzOn9GoXY7I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As a director, Kore-eda has proved himself to be a master of the slow-build human drama, a conjurer of small details that bed down and take root until his pictures burst into flower like a late cherry blossom. He makes films about life\u2019s humdrum little miracles \u2013 about the wrong turns that lead to the right places and about jerry-rigged families that somehow hold together. The Truth contains sprinkles of the reliable Kore-eda magic and throws in just enough curveballs to keep the story honest, even if it does pander to certain genre cliches. As with most backstage sagas, the film suggests that famous actors are a bit like Greek gods: capricious and exasperating but a cut above the likes of you and me.<br><br>Fabienne, for her part, is utterly unrepentant. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to be a bad mother, a bad friend, but a great actress,\u201d she declares.

      "bodyText": "The sun rises on day one of the Venice film festival and it catches the guests in a delicate state. They\u2019re still sleepy, struggling to get their bearings and nursing hangovers from the welcome drinks the night before. These people require careful handling, a soothing introduction. Specifically, they need a film such as Hirokazu Kore-eda\u2019s The Truth, a well-appointed family melodrama that plays out among plumped cushions and expensive soft furnishings. These critics have only just rolled out of bed. Now, all at once, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re being rolled back again. Traditionally, Venice likes to open with a big Hollywood spectacular; with the one-take intensity of a film such as Birdman or the white-knuckle tension of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Gravity. And yet, The Truth is the most refined, stately curtain-raiser I can recall seeing here, a picture that likes to stroll and murmur where others run and shout. It\u2019s handsome, it\u2019s amusing, it knows exactly where it\u2019s going. All that is missing is that crucial fifth gear. Shooting for the first time outside his native Japan, Kore-eda makes himself comfortable in a plush Paris home and coaxes impeccable performances from his regal French stars. Catherine Deneuve headlines as Fabienne, a diva-ish actress, trailing clouds of glory (no stretch there, then). Juliette Binoche plays the shrewd, sceptical Lumir, so accustomed to living in her mother\u2019s shadow that she wears designer black to blend in. Fabienne has just published a self-serving memoir (The Truth) which glosses over the fractious relationship between mother and daughter and airbrushes out the nefarious means by which she landed her breakthrough role. \u201cI can\u2019t find any truth in here,\u201d snaps Lumir, although this is surely what happens when you have a parent who lies for a living. As a director, Kore-eda has proved himself to be a master of the slow-build human drama, a conjurer of small details that bed down and take root until his pictures burst into flower like a late cherry blossom. He makes films about life\u2019s humdrum little miracles \u2013 about the wrong turns that lead to the right places and about jerry-rigged families that somehow hold together. The Truth contains sprinkles of the reliable Kore-eda magic and throws in just enough curveballs to keep the story honest, even if it does pander to certain genre cliches. As with most backstage sagas, the film suggests that famous actors are a bit like Greek gods: capricious and exasperating but a cut above the likes of you and me. Fabienne, for her part, is utterly unrepentant. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to be a bad mother, a bad friend, but a great actress,\u201d she declares. Clearly relishing the role, Deneuve comes heaving through every scene like some formidable gunship, wreathed in cigarette smoke, running on scotch and all but scattering the supporting cast. Ethan Hawke plays Lumir\u2019s rackety husband, recently out of rehab. Ludivine Sagnier crops up as a pensive fellow performer. But they\u2019re clutching at straws, struggling to make themselves heard. Deneuve dominates. If Lumir can\u2019t reach her mother, maybe the acting still can.

At this point, a more lazy film would veer towards a Hollywood happy ending. The Truth, to its credit, understands that families are complex and that old grievances die hard. Sometimes a truce is the most one can wish for. Kore-eda won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes for his previous film, Shoplifters, a glorious love letter to a brood of petty thieves.

      "bodyText": "Ahead of its Venice film festival premiere, Warner Bros has released the final full trailer for Joker, a gritty period take on the unhinged DC villain. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man struggling to find his place in 70s Gotham. An aspiring comedian, he soon finds himself gaining fame in an unlikely, sinister manner. The latest trailer gives a longer look at The Hangover director Todd Phillips\u2019 left-field take on Batman\u2019s foe, turning his tale into a darker character study, complete with R rating for \u201cbloody violence, disturbing behavior, language and sex\u201d at odds with the PG-13 portrayals we have seen before. \u201cWe didn\u2019t follow anything from the comic books, which people are gonna be mad about,\u201d Phillips said to Empire. \u201cWe just wrote our own version of where a guy like Joker might come from. That\u2019s what was interesting to me. We\u2019re not even doing Joker, but the story of becoming Joker. It\u2019s about this man.\u201d Phoenix, who has avoided comic book films to date, explained that it was nuance that attracted him to the project. \u201cI think oftentimes, in these movies, we have these simplified, reductive archetypes, and that allows for the audience to be distant from the character, just like we would do in real life, where it\u2019s easy to label somebody as evil, and therefore say: \u2018Well, I\u2019m not that,\u2019\u201d he said to Total Film. Aside from Phoenix, the cast also includes Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Marc Maron and Brian Tyree Henry. Joker will premiere this week at the Venice film festival alongside high-profile titles such as Noah Baumbach\u2019s divorce drama Marriage Story starring Scarlett Johansson and James Gray\u2019s much delayed space epic Ad Astra. Joker hits cinemas on 4 October.",

Speaking at a conference in Paris, Simon Coveney said \u201cno one has yet come up with credible arrangements, or technological solutions, which could replace those temporary arrangements in the withdrawal agreement\u201d. \u201cThis is why Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s proposal to abolish the backstop, in the absence of agreed alternative arrangements, is something we cannot support.\u201d Coveney reminded the audience \u2013 which included the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay \u2013 that the backstop had been an agreement with the UK on the basis of a \u201cshared understanding\u201d of the unique situation in Ireland and that it had the support of the majority in Northern Ireland. He said the backstop remained \u201ccurrently the only viable, if temporary, solution\u201d for the Irish border, with sources saying the suspension of parliament will not make a difference to that view unless Johnson has fresh, viable plans. Barclay hit back immediately, saying the backstop was dead and that \u201cparliament will not allow the people of Northern Ireland to be subject to an indefinite period of continued alignment\u201d. He said: \u201cIt would mean Northern Irish citizens, UK citizens, being governed by rules in which we have no say,\u201d and added that, as it stands, the backstop would be harder to leave than the EU. He said discussions about the Irish border had to be taken out of any exit deal and moved to talks on the future trade relationship. Barclay also said as the Democratic Unionist party was against the backstop, it could not be deemed viable despite the fact the region voted to remain. \u201cThe backstop has also been universally rejected by one of the two key communities in Northern Ireland, which means it is an unstable basis for power-sharing in Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. Their remarks show the continued gulf in thinking on Brexit and put paid to the suggestion of a breakthrough made at the G7 summit in Biarritz. Barclay went on to accuse France of leaving British people resident in the country behind after Brexit. He said they would have fewer rights than the 300,000 French nationals in the UK in the event of no deal. \u201cEU leaders repeatedly tell me how important citizens\u2019 rights are to them but not only has the commission refused to agree a specific deal on citizens\u2019 rights \u2013 as requested by all political parties in the UK parliament \u2013 the offer here in France falls short of what we have set out in the UK in several respects,\u201d he said.

The company, founded in 2012 by John Foley, a former executive at the book chain Barnes &amp; Noble, was valued at $4bn last summer after raising $550m from investors led by the private equity firm TCV, which has previously backed Netflix, Spotify and Facebook. Peloton lets spin class fans work out in a gym or at home using a \u00a32,000 bike or treadmill fitted with a screen on which subscribers can livestream or download classes.

Foley said: \u201cPeloton is so much more than a bike \u2013 we believe we have the opportunity to create one of the most innovative global technology platforms of our time.\u201d The company says it has the potential to sell 14m bikes across the US, Canada and the UK and is attracting customers who would not previously have considered buying fitness equipment. Documents filed by the company this week reveal that Peleton\u2019s revenues more than doubled this year to $915m. Carolina Milanesi, a tech analyst at Creative Strategies in San Francisco, said Peloton\u2019s mix of a device with a social \u201ceco-system\u201d made it more resilient and attractive to investors than tech companies that relied solely on a piece of hardware. \u201cHardware is the part that others can copy or follow or even make better but the eco-system and software and fanbase is not something that is easy to replicate,\u201d she said.

      "body": "<p>It was <a href=\"https://qz.com/1695493/melania-trump-brigitte-macron-malgozia-tusk-akie-abe-at-the-g7/\" title=\"\">Donald Tusk on Instagram that did it</a>. Four wives of world leaders \u2013 Melania Trump, Brigitte Macron, Ma\u0142gorzata Tusk and Akie Abe \u2013 dressed in a spectrum from white to cream, skirts aflap, were enjoying the sea views at Biarritz during the G7 summit. It was a delineation of the acceptable limits of women on the world stage: they look like brides and it is their backs \u2013 their backs! \u2013 that are demurely captured on film. It would have been just about bearable were it not for the European council president\u2019s caption: \u201cMelania, Brigitte, Ma\u0142gosia and Akie \u2013 the light side of the Force.\u201d It is a statement that says so much: these women are the summer to the winter of us men, the fragility to our strength, the light side of our force. It was the first time I wanted to leave the EU.</p> <p>Maybe Tusk was having an off day. Surely, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, does not see his wife, Brigitte, as the \u201clight side of his force\u201d. Yet the patriarchy has many tendrils \u2013 and a much greater reach even than Tusk\u2019s Instagram account.</p> <p>Unavoidably, when wives down tools to follow their husbands to world summits, it underscores the message that women don\u2019t really have important business of their own. Sure, ladies, you have a little job and take it as seriously as you like, but when there is politics to be done, your presence, which begins and ends at decorative, is required. It is a world view that is slightly more textured than an assumption that women are wives first and independent beings second. There is the whiff of a heteronormative code, too: if the wives aren\u2019t going to do much more than look into the middle distance, their real purpose on the trip is to prove that the husband is a red-blooded fellow. Obviously. Because he has a wife. The Theresa and Philip May days are a reminder of the final leg of this ideological tripod: that only men belong at these events. This is why Angela Merkel never takes her husband on trips: people used to say Prof Joachim Sauer was \u201cpublicity shy\u201d, or \u201cintensely private\u201d. In fact, the questions that tableaux would have raised \u2013 what will the professor do while the ladies are visiting the female football team? \u2013 would have undermined Merkel. If he was out of place, then it followed that she was, too.</p> <p>More depressing is the inexorable slide into beauty contest: it starts off subtly, with an admiring comment on a dress \u2013 and why not add the price tag? It blossoms into a full ranking system, every attribute picked over. This is not limited to wives, but besets female politicians, too; never forget May and Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/28/daily-mail-legs-it-front-page-sexist\" title=\"\">meeting in 2017</a>, which descended into a contest over who had the best legs, on the principle that both women had legs and neither woman was wearing trousers, so what could be more natural than to compare the legs? No one likes overstatement, but when female political leaders can\u2019t go anywhere without having their body parts evaluated to see who, by social consensus, is more shaggable, then we are in a catch 22.</p> <p>But back to the spouses.

      "bodyText": "It was Donald Tusk on Instagram that did it. Four wives of world leaders \u2013 Melania Trump, Brigitte Macron, Ma\u0142gorzata Tusk and Akie Abe \u2013 dressed in a spectrum from white to cream, skirts aflap, were enjoying the sea views at Biarritz during the G7 summit. It was a delineation of the acceptable limits of women on the world stage: they look like brides and it is their backs \u2013 their backs! \u2013 that are demurely captured on film. It would have been just about bearable were it not for the European council president\u2019s caption: \u201cMelania, Brigitte, Ma\u0142gosia and Akie \u2013 the light side of the Force.\u201d It is a statement that says so much: these women are the summer to the winter of us men, the fragility to our strength, the light side of our force. It was the first time I wanted to leave the EU. Maybe Tusk was having an off day. Surely, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, does not see his wife, Brigitte, as the \u201clight side of his force\u201d. Yet the patriarchy has many tendrils \u2013 and a much greater reach even than Tusk\u2019s Instagram account. Unavoidably, when wives down tools to follow their husbands to world summits, it underscores the message that women don\u2019t really have important business of their own. Sure, ladies, you have a little job and take it as seriously as you like, but when there is politics to be done, your presence, which begins and ends at decorative, is required. It is a world view that is slightly more textured than an assumption that women are wives first and independent beings second. There is the whiff of a heteronormative code, too: if the wives aren\u2019t going to do much more than look into the middle distance, their real purpose on the trip is to prove that the husband is a red-blooded fellow. Obviously. Because he has a wife. The Theresa and Philip May days are a reminder of the final leg of this ideological tripod: that only men belong at these events. This is why Angela Merkel never takes her husband on trips: people used to say Prof Joachim Sauer was \u201cpublicity shy\u201d, or \u201cintensely private\u201d. In fact, the questions that tableaux would have raised \u2013 what will the professor do while the ladies are visiting the female football team? \u2013 would have undermined Merkel. If he was out of place, then it followed that she was, too. More depressing is the inexorable slide into beauty contest: it starts off subtly, with an admiring comment on a dress \u2013 and why not add the price tag? It blossoms into a full ranking system, every attribute picked over. This is not limited to wives, but besets female politicians, too; never forget May and Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s meeting in 2017, which descended into a contest over who had the best legs, on the principle that both women had legs and neither woman was wearing trousers, so what could be more natural than to compare the legs? No one likes overstatement, but when female political leaders can\u2019t go anywhere without having their body parts evaluated to see who, by social consensus, is more shaggable, then we are in a catch 22. But back to the spouses. In 2010, the spouses did not attend the G8 summit in Ontario. Was it because of the disconnect between a summit that concentrated on women\u2019s empowerment via maternal health and neonatal outcomes while a line of women utterly disempowered by their spousal status was considered too stark? No, it was because the summit was in Huntsville which is apparently a pain to get to. They stayed in Toronto instead. Now, by contrast, it seems that things have somehow got worse.

      "bodyText": "When Pinterest realized in 2018 that the search results for many health-related terms \u2013 such as \u201cvaccines\u201d or \u201ccancer cure\u201d \u2013 were polluted with non-scientific misinformation, the visual social media site took a radical step: it broke the search function for those terms. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for medical advice, please contact a healthcare provider,\u201d a message on the otherwise blank page read. On Wednesday, Pinterest announced a new step in its efforts to combat health misinformation on its platform: users will be able to search for 200 terms related to vaccines, but the results displayed will come from major public health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Vaccine Safety Net. The platform will also bar advertisements, recommendations and comments on those pages. \u201cIt was really important for us to make sure that this experience doesn\u2019t allow any misinformation to seep in,\u201d said Ifeoma Ozoma, public policy and social impact manager for Pinterest. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to end up in a situation where you click on a trustworthy pin and the recommendations or comments are full of misinformation.\u201d Social media platforms have faced significant criticism over their platforms\u2019 promotion of anti-vaccine propaganda this year, as measles outbreaks spread in the US, Europe and Asia.

It also condemns Liverpool\u2019s sporting director, Michael Edwards, claiming he refused to allow the striker \u2013 a cousin of Steven Gerrard \u2013 to join Fiorentina or Nordsj\u00e6lland on loan with a view to a permanent transfer next summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/28/champions-league-format-european-super-league-uefa\">More Champions League enrichment would risk great cost to football | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Liverpool insist the allegations are unfounded and that the statement is littered with inaccuracies. The club has not ruled out taking legal action over what it considers to be defamatory claims against itself and Edwards.</p> <p>Rubie\u2019s outburst followed Liverpool\u2019s rejection of a loan move to Fiorentina for Duncan, who endorsed and pinned his agent\u2019s tweet before removing it. The teenager, who joined Liverpool from Manchester City in August 2018 having stalled on a new contract, played for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team during pre-season having been top scorer for the under-18s last term with 32 goals.</p> <p>The statement released by Rubie alleged: \u201cA few months ago before the end of last season, Bobby had meetings with the club\u2019s hierarchy including academy director Alex Inglethorpe.

      "bodyText": "Liverpool have been accused of \u201cmentally bullying\u201d Bobby Duncan by representatives of the 18-year-old and holding the player against his will after rejecting two loan offers for the striker. Saif Rubie, Duncan\u2019s agent, issued an extraordinary statement on Twitter on Wednesday that claimed the boyhood Liverpool fan has not left his house for four days because of stress and will not return to the club. It also condemns Liverpool\u2019s sporting director, Michael Edwards, claiming he refused to allow the striker \u2013 a cousin of Steven Gerrard \u2013 to join Fiorentina or Nordsj\u00e6lland on loan with a view to a permanent transfer next summer. Liverpool insist the allegations are unfounded and that the statement is littered with inaccuracies. The club has not ruled out taking legal action over what it considers to be defamatory claims against itself and Edwards. Rubie\u2019s outburst followed Liverpool\u2019s rejection of a loan move to Fiorentina for Duncan, who endorsed and pinned his agent\u2019s tweet before removing it. The teenager, who joined Liverpool from Manchester City in August 2018 having stalled on a new contract, played for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team during pre-season having been top scorer for the under-18s last term with 32 goals. The statement released by Rubie alleged: \u201cA few months ago before the end of last season, Bobby had meetings with the club\u2019s hierarchy including academy director Alex Inglethorpe. It was recognised that Bobby wasn\u2019t happy at Liverpool for different reasons and Alex invited us to bring offers to the club for the exit of Bobby Duncan. \u201cFor a player with zero first-team experience, no clubs were prepared to pay an outright reasonable [sic] fee for a player they got for \u00a3200,000 last summer. With that in mind we have been able to find clubs that were ready to take Bobby on a season-long loan with an option to buy for amounts of \u00a31.5m upwards which is a great return for the club on a player who will never play for the Liverpool first team and who doesn\u2019t want to be there. \u201cThe club and Michael Edwards specifically made it clear that that kind of deal wouldn\u2019t work. So then myself and my team worked even harder and managed to get a deal on the table for a loan with an obligation to buy after five starts with a higher transfer fee than before and a sell-on to Liverpool.\u201d It added: \u201cThe real reason Bobby missed the under-23 game [against Southampton] on Monday is because he has suffered some deep mental health issues with all the stress the club has put him under. Stress of being told he can leave but then going out of their way to force him to stay against his will. Not only is he on a very small salary but he also has one season left on his contract after this one and Liverpool have flatly said he will not get a new one. \u201cBobby has not left his room for four days because of this and will never go back to Liverpool again and my only concern now is his mental health and wellbeing \u2026 It\u2019s a sad state of affairs that a club such as Liverpool can be allowed to get away with mentally bullying and destroying the life of a young man such as Bobby.\u201d Liverpool regard Duncan highly and believe the striker, who scored in last season\u2019s FA Youth Cup final victory against City, can continue to progress with the under-23s this season. A spokesperson for the club said: \u201cLiverpool football club is aware of and disappointed by the unattributed [sic] comments and unfounded allegations that have been made in the media regarding one of our players. As the interests of the player in question are not best served by either inaccurate speculation, inflammatory statements or public discourse, we will be making no further comment.

The owner of petrochemicals giant Ineos is on the hunt for shale gas investments within the US fracking heartlands of the Permian Basin, according to sources. The billionaire industrialist is understood to have begun assessing a number of US shale projects over the summer as part of a multibillion-dollar debut in the US oil and gas industry. The sources confirmed reports that Ineos\u2019s new fossil fuel frontier will include a bid for $1.5bn (\u00a31.22bn) worth of oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico, which were put up for sale earlier this year by the US company ExxonMobil. The company is also hoping to follow the likes of Exxon, Chevron and Shell into the US shale industry, which promises quick returns on low cost oil and gas, the sources said. A spokesman at Ineos\u2019s Swiss headquarters declined to comment on \u201crumour and speculation\u201d. Ineos already imports US shale gas to its Grangemouth refinery in Scotland in the form of ethane, which it breaks down into ethylene to use to make plastics. The company had hoped to develop its own shale gas projects on British soil to cut the costs of shipping gas across the Atlantic. But its projects in Yorkshire, the east Midlands and Cheshire have been cast in doubt after all three regions rejected its applications. Ratcliffe has railed against the government\u2019s \u201cunworkable\u201d earthquake rules, which force fracking to stop for 18 hours if the work triggers a tremor which registers higher than 0.5 magnitude. He accused ministers of \u201cplaying politics with the future of the country\u201d by implementing a planning system which is \u201carchaic, glacially slow, inordinately expensive and virtually unworkable\u201d. He has also said Holyrood\u2019s decision to rule out fracking in Scotland \u201cbeggars belief\u201d. Progress at Ratcliffe\u2019s sites in England have also stalled. Earlier this summer Ineos launched an appeal against Rotherham council after it twice turned down applications to test for shale on a site at Woodsetts, South Yorkshire. Ineos heard last month that the decision will be postponed until 2020. Ratcliffe vowed in late 2014 to become the UK\u2019s biggest shale player by investing $1bn in developing new shale projects in Scotland and the north of England. The company promised \u201csubstantial further investment\u201d if the projects went on to produce gas, including a 6% cut of its revenues for local communities. Ratcliffe, a Brexit supporter, moved to the tax haven of Monaco last summer just months after he was knighted by the Queen for services to business and investment.",

small proportion of surnames actually come from professions. According to research from the University of the West of England, Bristol (UWE Bristol), almost half of them are derived from locations (known as toponymic names), 2:A - Bl\u00e6r is a masculine noun, meaning 'light breeze', causing it to be classified as a man\u2019s name by the Icelandic Naming Committee. First names are a hot topic in Iceland, as they\u2019re handed down to create surnames, with the suffix '-son' for boys and '-d\u00f3ttir' for girls. More recent legislation allows for non-gendered first and surnames, 3:C - Deed poll welcomes first names or surnames with a single character, but if you\u2019re going over 150 characters you\u2019ll need to get in touch with them. Honorific first names are not allowed in case you mislead people, and punctuation must have a phonetic value, 4:D - In the Sikh tradition, 'Singh' means lion and was the name given to all male followers; 'Kaur' means princess and was given to all females. Today, many Sikh families have reverted to using their family name but retain Singh or Kaur as a middle name, 5:C - Occasionally known as 'onomatology', onomastics refers to the study or science of names. These names can be handed down in various ways in different cultures, with matrilineal and patrilineal indicating whether they come from the mother\u2019s or father\u2019s side, 6:D - When it comes to the Irish tradition, O\u2019 means 'descended from' \u2013 in this case, perhaps from a family of dog breeders. According to ancestry experts, Byrne means 'raven', Murphy means 'sea warrior' and O\u2019Sullivan relates to an eye, though no one can quite agree on what kind, 7:A - While it\u2019s true that you can hitch a ride in a van, that wasn\u2019t what we were looking for here. 'Von' has Germanic origins and is being phased out in Austria as part of the abolishment of aristocratic titles. 'Van' has the same root but is more common in Dutch and Afrikaans and is not associated with nobility \u2013 both words mean 'from', 8:B - Farah is best known as an Arabic surname, meaning 'joy', 'happiness' or 'delight', but in 1881 it also cropped up as the surname of a few general labourers. A regional adaptation of 'Farrer', the name stemmed from jobs involving ferrous metals (such as ironmongers and blacksmiths), 9:D - Surnames are not an exact science and didn\u2019t exist with any formality until the 11th century, when population increases made them handy to have. Human error, regional variants and evolving spellings mean we have Clerks, Clarks, Clerkes and Clarkes</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"3\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Well done!\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"7\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">7 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Well done!</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Good effort\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"4\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">4 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Good effort</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Nice try!\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"0\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">0 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Nice try!</p></li>\n    </ol>\n   </div> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><em>Discover your backstory by charting your family tree.

Results from these affordable, easy-to-use kits can tell individuals their ethnic makeup and provide them with a list of genetic matches via the database used, estimating how close each person is genetically. DNA searches can break down barriers in the search for ancestors, filling in gaps when the paper trail goes cold. AncestryDNA uses communities from the past 300 years, which can show you directly where to look for records. But still employ old-fashioned research to back up the information DNA reveals. Used together, DNA findings and conventional sources can unlock a family history. Discover your backstory by charting your family tree. Start a 14-day free trial at ancestry.co.uk",

Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Alan Baxter. BITS AND BOBS Bury have been expelled from the English Football League after 125 years of continued membership. Meanwhile, Bolton have been given 14 days to complete a sale of the club or be expelled from the EFL. Alexis S\u00e1nchez (and his two dogs) have arrived in Milan for his loan move to Inter, who do not have an option to buy, but will cough up \u00a3175,000 of the Chilean\u2019s \u00a3390,000 weekly salary. A coalition of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham supporter groups have come up with a six-point plan for Uefa including allocating 80% of tickets for finals to supporters, to sell tickets at affordable prices and to choose a host city \u201cthat ensures no discrimination or denial of right of entry is applied to any player or supporter travelling to the final\u201d. Fizzy Cup round up, featuring embarrassing exits for Norwich City and Crystal Palace. Daniel Levy and Christian Eriksen\u2019s Mr 15% aren\u2019t getting on. Wah! Dean Saunders has been jailed for 10 weeks after pleading guilty to failing to comply with a roadside breath test. Remember that bit/bob in yesterday\u2019s Fiver about Red Star fans parking a decommissioned, Soviet-made, T-55 Yugoslav army tank outside the stadium before their Champions League qualifier. Well Red Star qualified for the group stage, and the players used the tank for a ride home. STILL WANT MORE? David Conn, who grew up five miles from Gigg Lane and went to school in Bury, has laid out all the grim details of how Bury FC got to this point. Paul Wilson\u2019s column on the future of European football starts with a nice Fergie quote, which is a good a reason as any to click here. This week\u2019s Knowledge asks: what is the most unusual non-football event staged at a football stadium? Answers include Transformers, ballet and Neighbours \u2026 Borja Bast\u00f3n: Swansea\u2019s record \u00a315.5m signing went 1,022 days without a goal for the club but now can\u2019t stop scoring. Ben Fisher has more. Oh, and if it\u2019s your thing \u2026 you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace. And INSTACHAT, TOO! WHERE IS HANS MOLEMAN?",

There are about 60,000 amateur arts groups in the UK, involving more than 10 million people. Through the annual Epic awards scheme, supported by Arts Council England since 2010, Voluntary Arts highlights the incredible achievements of groups led by volunteers who are transforming their communities. The Get Creative campaign, which is run by a group of cultural organisations including Voluntary Arts, the BBC and Arts Council England, celebrates and supports the everyday creativity happening in homes and public spaces across the UK through the annual Get Creative Festival, but Nicholas Serota neglects to mention this.Arts Council England\u2019s draft new strategy emphasises the importance of people participating in creative activities in our communities, but Nicholas Serota\u2019s article neglects to mention this.

Witty placards featuring crude innuendos about the prime minister will raise a smile and brighten up a protest, but they will not topple governments. Our existing rights and freedoms were not given as acts of charity from beneficent elites \u2013 they were secured through relentless, determined struggle. Democracy is menaced, and it is this tradition which must be relied on to defend it. The British people must now take to the streets, and deploy the tactic used by their ancestors to secure the rights of women, of workers, of minorities, of LGBTQ people: peaceful civil disobedience. If parliament is to be shut down, MPs must refuse to leave it. It should be occupied by the citizens it exists to serve. Other acts of peaceful civil disobedience \u2013 including the occupation of government offices across the country \u2013 should follow. If a general strike is necessary to defend democracy, then so be it. The prime minister \u2013 a self-professed champion of bankers who wishes to shower the rich with tax cuts, deregulate and attack workers\u2019 rights \u2013 is farcically trying to portray himself as a tribune of the people against the elites. His latest manoeuvre must be exposed as an act of hubris by an unaccountable political elite with contempt for democracy. The protest movement that must now emerge must draw the true battle-lines ahead of an impending general election. It must not be simply be a contest defined by how we voted one summer\u2019s day in 2016. It will be a fight between those who create the wealth and the elites who hoard it; between those who paid for the crash and those who caused it; between those who pay their taxes and those who dodge them. However much the Conservative establishment dress themselves in revolutionary garb, they are the political representatives of those who fund them \u2013 not those who sleeplessly stare at ceilings in the early hours, panicking over unopened energy bills on kitchen tables, but the hedge fund managers, poverty-paying bosses and bankers who plunged Britain into the abyss, for whom this country is a playground in which to run riot, while others pick up the bill. If no deal happens, the Tories will look after their own \u2013 they always do \u2013 while the ex-mining and steel and industrial communities trashed by their predecessors will suffer a renewed kicking. But none of this is inevitable: and, just as our ancestors fought with determination and courage to win our rights, it now falls to us to defend them. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap The pound has come under fresh pressure today after the government moved to suspend parliament for five weeks. Sterling tumbled by more than a cent at one stage, hitting $1.2155, after Boris Johnson\u2019s government made the dramatic move to prorogue parliament for five weeks - much longer than normal. The pound also weakened against the euro, dropping below \u20ac1.1 and heading back to the 10-year low struck earlier this month. It has now lost around 7% of its value since March, when Britain\u2019s Brexit extension was agreed. Before the 2016 referendum, one pound was worth \u20ac1.30, and around $1.48. The move cuts the time available to MPs to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Under a Privy Council order approved by the Queen today, parliament will rise sometime 9th and 12 September, and not return until 14 October for a Queen\u2019s Speech. Prime minister Boris Johnson has written to MPs pledging a vote on his plans after the next EU Council meeting on 17th and 18th October. This tees up a titanic clash with MPs who oppose a no deal, or who want Brexit stopped. Several City economists and investors voiced concerns over the move. Derek Halpenny of MUFG said Britain faces a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d, while Seema Shah of Principal Global Investors warned that Britain could be dragged into recession. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada warned that no-deal Brexit looks more likely than before, at around 44% probability (based on market data). Deutsche Bank put the chance at 50%. Oliver Blackbourn of Janus Henderson Investors told clients to expect more drama in Westminster, with a likely no-confidence vote in Johnson\u2019s government as soon as parliament returns after its summer break at the start of September. \u201cSummer holidays are definitely over for MPs, now comes the shouting,\u201d Blackbourn says. Business groups voiced alarm. The British Chambers of Commerce warned that the UK was already suffering from Brexit uncertainty, and urged MPs to resist a no-deal shock. Shares in UK companies who are exposed to Brexit risks also fell. Housebuilders led the fallers on the FTSE 100 index, with Berkeley Group closing 4.8% lower, and Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Development losing 3.5%. Our Politics Live blog has all the latest from parliament: That\u2019s probably all for today - thanks for reading and commenting. GW Deutsche Bank estimates that there is now a 50% chance that Britain crashes out of the European Union without a deal at the end of October. The best way of avoiding it, they suggest, is a \u2018national unity\u2019 government. For that to happen, though, Johnson\u2019s opponents must agree on an alternative leader..... Derek Halpenny, head of research at financial firm MUFG, fears the pound will slide in the coming weeks - and slump to just $1.1 if a no-deal Brexit were to happen. \u201cToday\u2019s development brings us firmly into the realms of a \u2018Constitutional Crisis\u2019. The proroguing of Parliament leaves an incredibly narrow window for Parliament to legislate the move, agree to an Article 50 extension or organise a no-confidence motion. All of the above means no-deal Brexit is looking ever more likely. GBP downside risks will continue to plague the market. It is only a matter of time until the recent GBP/USD low of 1.2015 is brought even lower. The MUFG base case no-deal Brexit assumption and our current year-end target of 1.1000 remain intact.\u201d The Economist Intelligence Unit is hardly a hotbed of left-wing radicalism, but their managing director Robin Bew isn\u2019t impressed by the proroguing of parliament. The Queen didn\u2019t hang about. Following today\u2019s Privy Council meeting, an order has been issue to prorogue parliament between Monday 9th and Thursday 12th September. As expected, business would remain suspended until 14th October when the Queen would reopen parliament and outline the legislative agenda. Some government MPs are arguing that this five-week suspension isn\u2019t a big deal, as the Commons would have shut down for the party conference season. However, the Hansard Society have told us that this is the longest proroguing of parliament since 1945, during Britain\u2019s biggest political crisis in decades. There was also speculation that opposition MPs could have tried to keep parliament running through Conference season (although I don\u2019t think a formal plan had been put forward....) Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, is alarmed to see the government flirting with a possible no-deal Brexit on 31 October. She fears it would plunge the UK into a full-blown recession, at a time when global trade wars are also hurting the economy. \u201cFrom an economic point of view, actively pursuing a no-deal Brexit through suspending parliament is tantamount to actively pursuing a recession. The PM\u2019s move comes at a time when the FTSE 100 is on course to record its largest monthly fall in four years. The large, multinational businesses in the FTSE have, naturally, been highly sensitive to an escalating trade war between China and the US, particularly as the complex global supply chains of which they are parts face seismic disruptions. They are fighting political fires at home and abroad. Shah reckons that many international investors are keeping clear of UK assets, explaining: Although the pound had been mounting something of a feeble rally against the dollar in August \u2013 before The PM\u2019s bombshell - it was still at rock bottom valuations against the US and Eurozone currencies. Company fundamentals remain broadly strong so the implication is that global investors have finally reached the \u201cdo not touch\u201d point for UK equities The CBI are also concerned: President Donald Trump has just backed Johnson..... I\u2019m sure those who criticised Barack Obama for his \u2018back of the queue\u2019 comments before the Brexit vote in 2016 will be equally upset to see another US president weighing in on UK politics. Bloomberg reports that its customers have been frantically searching for what it means to \u2018prorogue\u2019 parliament. That confirms that investors around the globe are taking a close interest in Brexit, as they watch the pound drop today. The big picture is that the pound has shed 7.5% of its value over the last five months, as a no-deal Brexit has become more likely. Sterling hit $1.32 back in mid-March, when it became clear that Britain wasn\u2019t leaving the EU as Theresa May had hoped. It\u2019s now 10 cents lower at around $1.22. Here\u2019s a quick guide to prorogation: There are 700 members of the Privy Council, which is one of the oldest parts of Britain\u2019s constitutional framework. But Queen Elizabeth won\u2019t have to drag out hundreds of cups and saucers to refresh them all. You only need three Privy Counsellors to form a quorum (plus QEII). Two of them have already made the trip from London to Balmoral, according to the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. That includes Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, Lord President of the Privy Council. Shares in UK housebuilders are falling more sharply now - with Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey both shedding 4%. Fiona Cincotta of City Index predicts further losses for the pound, if Johnson can\u2019t make progress on replacing the Irish backstop. She writes; After reaching $1.23 in the previous session sterling tanked to a low of $1.2157 on Bojo\u2019s Parliament suspension plans. Under these circumstances we expect the bears to remain in control of the pound. Any bad news from Brussels regarding Irish backstop alternatives as talks kick off over there could send the pound tanking back towards the key psychological support of $1.20. Here\u2019s our news story on sterling\u2019s slide today, as the government moved to suspend parliament ahead of a Queen\u2019s Speech in mid-October. The pound is the worst-performing major currency today, Bloomberg reports. And things could get worse. A recent Bloomberg survey forecast that the pound could fall to $1.10, from $1.22 today, after a no-deal Brexit. Petr Krpata, a currency strategist at ING Groep NV, says: \u201cIt just underscores the veil of uncertainty the pound is facing, the still non-negligible risk of no-deal Brexit and the vulnerability of the currency to negative headline news.\u201d The imminent suspension of parliament will intensify calls to protect businesses from the disruption that a disorderly Brexit would cause. Already today, firms have asked the Irish government for \u20ac1bn of support, to cushion the blow of a \u201cBrexit shock\u201d after a no-deal exit. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll explains: They want a slice of Ireland\u2019s unprecedented \u20ac10.4bn (\u00a39.4bn) corporate tax intake earmarked for business trading in both directions that will be hit by tariffs, delays in Calais and Dover and other challenges in the event of the UK crashing out of the European Union on 31 October without a deal. John McGrane, the director general of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce (BICC), said: \u201cBy redirecting \u20ac1bn from the larger than expected corporate tax intake into a Brexit response fund, government can shore up indigenous businesses which are most at risk from a disorderly Brexit. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada have warned that the probability of a no-deal Brexit has risen to 44%, based on today\u2019s market moves. RBC\u2019s chief currency strategist, Adam Cole, says this is a new high, and a move that is matched by the euro\u2019s rally against the pound today. He explains: Using our usual proxy markets as a barometer, the net effect of this morning\u2019s UK news has been to push the probability of no deal exit to a new high of 44% (blue line) and we note that (focusing on daily changes rather than levels), GBP price action still closely mirrors shifts in this probability. Cole adds: Today\u2019s developments make exit with no deal marginally more likely (and some will say reveal a government preference for no deal), but it is still far from a certain prospect while parliament has possible routes to block it and while the possibility (albeit slim) still exists that Johnson could extract a deal from the EU that parliament can support. A renewed Brexit crisis increases the danger that Britain\u2019s economy falls into a technical recession this autumn. We learned earlier this month that UK GDP contracted by 0.2% in April-June, as companies ran down stocks build up ahead of the original Brexit deadline of 29th March. If the economy keeps shrinking in the current quarter (July-September), then the UK would officially be in recession for the first time in a decade. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway shows how Britain is underperforming other major economies: Brexit angst is also pushing down the FTSE 250 stock market index of medium-sized, mainly UK focused companies. It has fallen by 0.8%, or 155 points, this morning to 19,179 points. Almost every sector has fallen, led by industrial firms and consumer goods producers (both down 1%). Financial stocks, which would also suffer from a no-deal Brexit, are down 0.8%, followed by healthcare and energy firms. The larger blue-chip FTSE 100 is up 9 points, or 0.15%, with multinational companies (who earn money mainly in foreign companies) benefitting from the weak pound. But housebuilders are still suffering, with Berkeley losing almost 3% today. UK businesses are watching events in parliament with growing frustration and alarm, judging by this statement from Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce: \u201cBusinesses feel like Westminster is playing an endless game of political chess, while their futures and the health of the UK economy hang in the balance. \u201cEvery move in this game is prompting more questions, not just amongst businesses here at home but also amongst their partners around the world. Out in the real world, continuing political turbulence is taking a toll on contracts, on investment decisions, and on business confidence. Three years on, the damage continues. \u201cThe top priority for businesses and the economy is still to avoid a messy and disorderly exit from the EU on the 31st of October. Despite the noise, none of the events of the last few days have given businesses greater confidence that this will be achieved. Given this, it is essential for government and its agencies to further boost support for businesses through any scenario. \u201cOnce again, businesses will have to try their best to prepare for an unclear future as the political process goes down to the wire.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about the government\u2019s plan to suspend parliament next month: The pound has now fallen through \u20ac1.1 against the euro, after the House of Commons speaker John Bercow issued a blistering attack on the government\u2019s plan. That\u2019s a one-week low, down 0.7% today, towards the 10-year low of \u20ac1.072 struck earlier this month. Bercow is accusing the government of \u201ca constitutional outrage\u201d, warning that shutting down parliament to prevent a proper Brexit debate would be \u201can offence against the democratic process. German bank Berenberg isn\u2019t convinced that suspending parliament strengthens Boris Johnson\u2019s hand. The argument is that preventing MPs blocking No Deal makes the threat more credible, forcing Brussels to compromise and drop the Irish Backstop (which keeps the UK aligned with the EU if a free trade deal isn\u2019t agreed after Brexit). Holger Schmieding, Berenberg\u2019s chief economist, says this logic is flawed, for three reasons: The EU is already taking the hard Brexit risk seriously. Even if Johnson tries to ramp up the pressure, the much bigger EU would still believe that the UK has much more to lose from a hard Brexit than the EU. The move strengthens the EU suspicion that Johnson\u2019s prime motive is to win snap elections shortly after Brexit rather than to conclude a deal with the EU Instead, suspending parliament also accentuates the UK\u2019s constitutional crisis, he tells clients in a research note (online here), concluding: In a way, a need for a Prime Minister to suspend his own parliament because he seems to lack a majority for his key policy \u2013 the approach to Brexit \u2013 is not exactly a sign of strength, to put it mildly. City investment management firm Brooks Macdonald has warned clients that the risk of a no-deal Brexit is rising. It is maintaining an \u201cunderweight\u201d rating on UK assets -- a polite way of saying they they\u2019re assessing British stocks with a lengthy bargepole. Brooks Macdonald says proroguing parliament, even over the Party Conference season, will restrict parliament\u2019s options: With only 22 scheduled business days for the House of Commons between now and the Brexit deadline, removing around a third of these will cause procedural issues for opposition plans to legislate to prevent a no deal Brexit. Sterling\u2019s reaction has been for a sharp fall vs both the dollar and euro from already suppressed levels. Domestic focused UK stocks have underperformed International peers as the heightened risk of a no deal secession begins to be priced into markets. With the outcome of Brexit remaining volatile and unclear, sterling will remain under pressure and trade within a range that reflects the dual possibilities of a deal and a disruptive exit. As a result we maintain our underweight to UK assets despite the valuations on offer. Mujtaba Rahman, analyst at Eurasia Group, says Boris Johnson has dramatically raised the stakes in his battle with MPs trying to stop a no-deal Brexit. Now that Boris has gone nuclear, it may require MPs to switch back to their own nuclear option\u2014passing a no-confidence vote in the Government next week. The PM\u2019s aides insist it is normal for a new Government to hold a Queen\u2019s Speech and deny the charge of suppressing debate, though few MPs will believe that. Boris allies stress that his twin-track strategy is on track and unchanged by the move. They hope that showing that Parliament cannot stop no-deal will put more pressure on the EU to make concessions over the Irish backstop. MPs will try every trick in their book to stop Johnson\u2019s plans and now try to pass a law in the short September session. They will likely win the backing of the Speaker John Bercow. Ultimately, the major constitutional row could be resolved in the courts. Johnson has now written to MPs, confirming that he will seek to suspend parliament in the \u201csecond sitting week of September\u201d. That will be shortly after MPs debate Northern Ireland on the 9th September. He adds that MPs will vote on his legislative plans on 21st and 2nd October, a week after the Queen\u2019s Speech and just after the crucial European Council meeting of EU leaders of 17-18th October. Johnson is also promising parliament a vote on any new deal he agrees with the EU, after that Council meeting. Prime minister Boris Johnson has now confirmed that the Queen\u2019s Speech will be delivered on 14th October. That means parliament will be suspended at some stage ahead of that date. In a video clip just broadcast, Johnson also denied that parliament was being sidelined. There will be \u201cample time\u201d to debate Brexit, he insists, ahead of the next EU council meeting on 17th-18th October. That summit feels like the last chance for the UK and EU to agree any changes to the current Withdrawal Agreement ahead of 31st October deadline. The plan to suspend parliament until mid-October has damaged hopes that the UK could avoid crashing out of the European Union without a deal, says Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades. Sterling rallied yesterday, after opposition leaders had agreed on a strategy to prevent a no-deal Brexit, but has lost all those gains this morning. Evangelista explains: The markets regard no deal as the worst possible outcome for the British economy and news that there will be a cross party effort to counter Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s plans to leave on the 31st of October no matter what, were enough to fuel Sterling gains of nearly 0.5% to the Dollar. However, these gains have been completely cancelled during early Wednesday trading, as reports emerge that Boris Johnson will ask the Queen to suspend parliament from mid-September until mid-October; a move seen as a way to ensure his plans of a no-deal Brexit are executed, without interference from MPs opposed to such an outcome. Shares in some UK-focused companies are also dropping, hit by fears of a no-deal Brexit. Housebuilders are among the top fallers on the FTSE 100 index, with Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon both losing over 2%. You know things are getting serious when MPs are tweeting graphics of the pound-dollar exchange rate: The pound has now hit a one-week low against the US dollar at $1.218, down more than a cent today. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says they could be further losses, if the Queen agrees to suspend parliament until the middle of October. He explains: Sterling has fallen off the cliff as investors have become increasing anxious about the Brexit chaos. Boris doesn\u2019t want anyone to stop his plan of no Brexit and if the Queen approves his request then there is only his way or the highway. The ride on this highway is going to be more turbulent than ever and British politicians do not realise this. They have made a circus out of Brexit. For speculators, the focus is going to be on one thing only: is the Queen going to approve the request. If she does then expect a major deeper sell off for sterling. City traders are calculating that the risk of a no-deal Brexit has risen, and acting accordingly (by hammering the SELL THE POUND button). The selloff is gathering pace -- with the pound now down almost a whole cent at $1.22. There have been rumours for weeks that Boris Johnson prorogue parliament, in an attempt to thwart MPs who oppose a no-deal Brexit. But today\u2019s today\u2019s developments have still come as a nasty surprise to the City, which is why the pound is reacting so sharply. On Sunday, the Observer reported that Johnson was seeking legal advice on whether to shut parliament down for five weeks, despite concerns that a no-deal Brexit could cause economic chaos. My colleague Frances Perraudin has all the details from Westminster: The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has heard that Boris Johnson\u2019s plan is to hold a Queen\u2019s Speech - outlining the legislative priorities - on 14th October. That\u2019s just two-and-a-half weeks before the UK is due to leave the EU. She adds that parliament could be suspended, or prorogued, more than a month earlier until around 11 September (it was already expected to pause for the autumn party conference season). The pound has also dropped against the euro to \u20ac1.103, from \u20ac1.108 yesterday (a one-month high). Newsflash: The pound is suddenly sliding, on reports that Boris Johnson\u2019s government is taking steps to prevent MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. There\u2019s a rumour that Britain\u2019s Privy Council (a group of senior, experienced advisors and politicians) will meet with Queen Elizabeth at Balmoral, her Scottish castle, later today to discuss the possible suspension - or proroguing - of parliament. My colleague Heather Stewart, and the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson, have both heard the details.... Proroguing parliament could prevent MPs from taking a no-deal Brexit off the table, through legislation or via a no-confidence vote in Johnson\u2019s government. These rumours have knocked half a cent off the pound, down to $1.223 against the US dollar. That wipes out Tuesday\u2019s gains, which came after Johnson said he was \u2018marginally\u2019 more confident of agreeing a new deal with the EU. The Guardian\u2019s latest Brexit dashboard is out today, and it shows that the UK economy faces a turbulent autumn- having already contracted slightly in the April-June quarter. My colleague Richard Partington explains: Boris Johnson is heading into the crunch period for Brexit negotiations with the UK economy potentially on the brink of recession and as global economic growth falters, according to a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month. The prime minister faces the challenge of breaking the deadlock with Brussels to avoid a no-deal Brexit on Halloween, just as the outlook for the economy deteriorates at home and abroad. The latest phase of talks came as Britain recorded the first fall in quarterly GDP since 2012 and as Donald Trump engages the US in a trade war with China, dragging down global trade volumes and economic growth. Economists warned that the wider global slump raised the chances of a prolonged downturn in Britain and made it more difficult for the UK to rely on trade with other nations to boost the economy after leaving the EU. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), said the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU \u201ccouldn\u2019t have come at a worse time\u201d as the world economy slows. \u201cBusinesses remain largely unprepared for a disastrous cliff-edge no deal and are in sit-and-wait mode while business groups continue to speak out against the economic chaos,\u201d he added. Here\u2019s the latest dashboard, which shows how the pound has been volatile as the risk of a no-deal Brexit has risen: Worryingly, the US yield curve is continuing to invert this morning. The gap between 2-year and 10-year bond yields has swelled to 6 basis points, its biggest gap since 2007 (as the financial crisis took hold). The yield on 30-year US government bonds has just hit a record low too, at just 1.9% -- below the interest rate on 3-month debt. Not a good sign..... In normal times, the state of the US yield curve would only be of interest to bond traders, as they chase the best possible return while balancing risk. But once it\u2019s inverted, the yield curve becomes a lot more interesting -- because of its reputation as a harbinger of recession. Craig Erlam of City trading firm OANDA, blames the latest escalation in the US-China trade war, with both sides announcing new tariffs late last week: I fear yield curve inversions are going to become the dinner table bitcoin chat of 2017 in the coming months as prophecy becomes self-fulfilling and we blindly wander into a recession. Obviously the timing of this is no coincidence, coming so shortly the US and China decided to step it up a gear and inflict additional tariffs on one another. Naturally this was accompanied by fighting talk from Trump, the usual bashing of the head of his central bank and then some very mixed messages from both sides regarding a phone call that may or may not have happened. With stock markets flat today, we\u2019re clearly not yet seeing widespread panic about the latest recession warning but the heightened sensitivity to it may eventually take its toll. In much the way that people are questioning whether talk of recession makes one inevitable, the impact on stocks could become self-fulfilling. Bloomberg\u2019s David Ingles has spotted that the entire spectrum of US government Treasury bonds are now yielding less than 2% per year. That suggests quite a lot of pessimism about long-term growth prospects. The Financial Times is also concerned about the US government bond market, saying it is giving \u201cthe most dire signal since 2007\u201d. Here\u2019s a flavour: A widely watched US bond market indicator of recession sent its most dire signal since the early days of the financial crisis on Tuesday, reflecting increasing gloom about the economic consequences of the US-China trade war. Yields on two-year Treasury notes were 5.3 basis points higher than those on the 10-year government bond \u2014 the largest gap since March 2007. This kind of inversion of the yield curve \u2014 in which shorter-term rates are higher than longer-term ones \u2014 has preceded every US recession of the past half century. At the same time, another closely followed portion of the yield curve \u2014 reflecting the difference between the yields on three-month and 10-year Treasury securities \u2014 blew past its recent lows, settling at minus 51.4bp. This excellent chart from CNBC shows how US bond yields have fallen sharply in recent months. Yields, or the rate of return on a bond, move inversely to prices. So as concerns over economic growth have risen, investors have been scrambling to buy bonds, pushing prices up and yields down. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Recession worries are swirling in the markets today, as the US bond market continues to flash warning lights. Overnight, the US bond yield curve slipped deeper into inversion -- a classic warning sign that a downturn could be approaching (but not an infallible one...). That means longer-term US bonds are trading at a lower interest rate than longer-term debt -- inverting the principle that investors demand a higher rate of return for lending for longer. Specifically, 10-year Treasury bills are changing hands at a yield of just 1.47% this morning, very low in historic terms, compared to 1.51% for 2-year bonds. That\u2019s because investors are piling into the safe assets such as long-term American government debt, suggesting they are worried that the economic outlook could be souring. Such an inversion has preceded every US recession in the last 50 years, which is why it\u2019s causing such concern on the trading floors. In normal times, longer-dated bonds trade at a significantly higher yield to short-term ones, reflecting the extra risk that an investor is taking (a lot can happen in a decade). This move appears driven by concerns that the US-China trade war is escalating, and the risk of a no-deal Brexit in two months time. There\u2019s also uncertainty over how America\u2019s central bank will respond to the slowdown, and to a barrage of criticism from president Trump. Readers may recall that the US yield curve inverted a couple of weeks ago, triggering an 800-point tumble on the Dow Jones industrial average. But this latest move is bigger -- and importantly the yield curve closed lower last night, rather than just dipping into inversion and then coming out again (as happened two weeks ago). Tom di Galoma, a managing director at Seaport Global Holdings, says the yield curve is giving \u201cthe ultimate flashing red light,\u201d adding: \u201cWhat is taking place today is that bond investors are realising that lower rates are upon us.\u201d He\u2019s also concerned that 10-year bonds are actually yielding less than 3-month T-bills - something that also occurred before the financial crisis more than a decade ago.

Some fans are huddled under umbrellas, checking their phones for the latest news; others are just here because it feels like the right place to be today.</p> \n  <p>Tamoor Tariq, the deputy leader of Bury council, said his local authority was ready to support the club any way it can to ensure its survival, starting with reassuring fans about the future of its stadium, a fixture here since 1884.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cI want to be absolutely clear that if anyone thinks there will be any development on that site any time soon then they are totally misguided - planning law doesn\u2019t allow it, the fact that it\u2019s an asset of community value also means there are restrictions governing it.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He wouldn\u2019t be drawn on whether the council would chip in to help buy the club if supporters formed a Community Interest Company (like at Darlington FC in 2013) but he pointed out that the authority was also in financial difficulty, having suffered massive budget cuts since 2010.</p> \n  <p>Asked whether a fan-owned club looked was the most likely way forward for Bury FC, Tariq said: \u201cSomething needs to change. The immediate thing that need to happen is Mr Dale needs to depart from the club, he needs to give up all of his links and he needs to decide how quickly he\u2019s going to do that and allow - whether it\u2019s the fans or another buyer - other people to lead the ship.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s a sorry state of affairs that he\u2019s allowed this situation to develop because he entered negotiations with C&amp;N at a very late stage.

Assorted viewers accused him and the network that employs him of appearing to revel in Bury\u2019s demise in the tackiest manner imaginable. </p> \n  <p>Well, this morning on his Talksport show, Jim addressed the issue. He said that while he appreciated that people might have found the graphic tacky, he has no control over behind-the-scenes production at Sky. </p> \n  <p>He also went on to address the crusading he has done on behalf of Bury and Bolton fans on Talksport in recent weeks, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what we do\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been after answers constantly on this, fearlessly, I may say,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pursued [Ken] Anderson, [Laurence] Bassini, [Steve] Dale, the EFL and the PFA. I don\u2019t do it for me, I do it because I\u2019m given this opportunity at Talksport to do it for the fans to give you answers that you want.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd for some reason they talk to us and that\u2019s what I want. The important thing today is Bolton and Bury, not some ticking clock.\u201d Jim finished up by having a right go at somebody on Twitter posting under a made-up name who claimed he was revelling in Bury\u2019s demise. </p> \n  <p>Full disclosure: I know Jim, albeit barely. I am also a colleague of his at Talksport, although I have only ever done one show with him.</p> \n  <p>While I suspect a man of his status might have more clout than he is letting on when it comes to the behind-the-scenes goings-on at Sky Sports News when it comes to shows he is presenting, I genuinely can\u2019t think of any other national broadcaster who has done more in recent weeks to highlight the peril in which Bury and Bolton find themselves.

When you see the devastation of the fans I just think I have to say something. It\u2019s unbelievable. I still can\u2019t believe it. We have been in as normal, training. I don\u2019t think anyone really believed that this was going to happen. We were just preparing every single week as though the next game was going to be on, the next game was going to be on.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all folks: And on that comical bombshell, it\u2019s time to close this blog for the day. Thank you for your time and your correspondence and keep your eyes peeled for a first person account of the whole Bury meltdown from their winger, Harry Bunn. Speaking to Sky Sports, the Bury owner, Steve Dale, has called on the EFL to rescind the decision to expel his club from the Football League. Should his request go unanswered, he says he will demand the appointment of an independent adjudicator to review the decision. \u201cIf the many requests to rescind remain unanswered we believe an independent adjudicator should be brought in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want a secret ballot of all EFL clubs to ask the question if they want fellow clubs Bolton and Bury FC to be taken out of the league, I don\u2019t think they would want that.\u201d An email: I wrote earlier about how Jim White had addressed accusations of crassness from football fans after standing in front of a countdown clock on Sky Sports News yesterday as Bury headed towards oblivion. White mounted a fairly stirring defence of his actions on his Talksport show and was quick to point out, correctly, that he has done plenty to tackle the issues facing Bolton and Bury fans in recent weeks, by interviewing all the main players involved on a regular basis. Anyway, reader Thomas Atkins has got in touch to add his two cents ... \u201cFair to make the point about Jim White not necessarily being responsible for how crass he looked stood in front of the countdown, but I think it\u2019s also fair to say that Sky Sports have been part of many of the decisions that make life so difficult for EFL clubs \u2013 the increased concentration of wealth in the top tier, the influx of monies from disreputable sources, the encouragement, both implicitly and explicitly, to gamble financially wherever the opportunity presents itself,\u201d he says. \u201cThese people call themselves journalists and should be holding people to account. Where were they when the EFL was waving through the purchase of the club by a man clearly not fit and proper to do so? \u201cJim White\u2019s a decent presenter and very possibly a decent man, but his [employers at Sky] have been, at best, asleep on the job. For Sky Sports to be outside the ground feigning concern about the plight of Bury when that organisation have been responsible for creating so many of the conditions that have led to their demise is what sticks in the throat for many.\u201d The curious case of Bobby Duncan: While assorted Football Financial Woe correspondents write up their hot takes on the day\u2019s developments, or lack thereof, at Bolton and Bury, an interesting, if unedifying row is brewing on Twitter. Saif Rubie, a Dubai-based football agent who numbers Liverpool youngster Bobby Duncan among his clients, has posted a lengthy statement accusing Liverpool of keeping Duncan at the club against his will, causing the 17-year-old mental anguish in the process. In a Tweet, which Duncan pinned to his own Twitter account, before removing it and all trace of his Liverpool FC connections from his account, Rubie attacked Liverpool and their sporting director Michael Edwards, prompting Jamie Carragher to wade into the row. Duncan, 17, was previously best known for being the cousin of Steven Gerrard, and he scored his first goal for Liverpool in pre-season. The club, meanwhile, have strongly denied Rubie\u2019s claim. \u201cLiverpool Football Club is aware of and disappointed by the unattributed comments and unfounded allegations that have been made in the media regarding one of our players,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cAs the interests of the player in question are not best served by either inaccurate speculation, inflammatory statements or public discourse, we will be making no further comment. We will, however, continue our efforts to work privately with the player to find resolution in the best interests of all involved.\u201d An email: \u201cObviously these are cold-hearted financial decisions with extremely harsh consequences for people whose identity is strongly linked to their football club,\u201d writes Michael Allen. \u201cBut unfortunately it follows on logically from the way the football industry is run. It runs deeply into the culture of merciless free-market capitalism it seems to me. So there\u2019s no solution except some kind of revolution and that\u2019s unlikely where fans of the top richest teams are perfectly happy with things as they are (the gift that keeps on giving) and fans of many other clubs by contrast are just hanging on \u2013 in hope? Maybe they can look to alternatives viz AFC Wimbledon, FC United, Salford, Forest Green.\u201d DOesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ll have much choice now that liquidation seems to be on the cards, Michael. Here\u2019s hoping that once everyone else has moved on from this \u2013 and it will soon stop being headline news \u2013 there is enough enthusiasm in Bury to set up a phoenix club. While Bury have been expelled from the Football League, it is important to remember they still exist as a Football Club, albeit one with millions of pounds worth of debt and no source of income because they have no competition to play in and no way of generating revenue. David Conn has been in touch to say that this may not be the case for much longer, as imminent liquidation of the club seems the most likely outcome. \u201cSadly hearing that the most likely future for the club now is liquidation,\u201d he tweets. \u201cHaving been expelled from the EFL after 125 years they effectively have no business now. The players are free agents as it isn\u2019t an EFL club and can leave.\u201d A Tweet from Michael Hann, a diehard QPR fan and former music editor of this parish ... Meanwhile at Bolton Wanderers: Having seen their club issued with a 14-day notice to resolve their own ongoing financial issues or face expulsion from the Football League, Bolton fans are waiting for news of what fate lies in store for their club, a founder member of the Football League. Speaking on Talksport this morning, Debbie Jevans, executive chair of the EFL, said talks regarding a takeover are ongoing. \u201cWe finished working with Bolton and the administrator at 3am this morning,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody wants that deal to close. \u201cI\u2019m saying it\u2019s very close and I know people will be shouting at the radio when I say that as they\u2019ve heard it before, but what we couldn\u2019t have again was a situation where you\u2019ve got young players out there playing, losing 5-0 every week \u2013 that is not a sustainable way to run a football league. \u201cSo we\u2019ve issued that notice and lifted the suspension. But I will say to everyone, that at 3am this morning conversations were still ongoing.\u201d Meanwhile at The Athletic, Simon Hughes has published a lengthy special investigation in which he reveals that many Bolton players and staff have not been paid for five months, even though former Rushden and Diamonds chairman Keith Cousins has earned \u00a330,000 per month from administrators David Rubins and Partners for helping to run the club and trying to secure its sale. Hughes also reveals that Cousins has \u201cearned five per cent from money generated by players being sold or released and stands to pocket another two per cent of any takeover deal\u201d. Squires: There are have been no shortage of hot takes on the situation at Bury and Bolton, but few have nailed it so thoroughly as our resident cartoonist David Squires, with this incendiary closing panel in this week\u2019s offering. Video: \u201cThere\u2019s been grown men ... 50-year-old men, 60-year-old men here crying. Some of them don\u2019t cry at their own daughters\u2019 weddings. They come down here and they\u2019re in buckets of tears.\u201d An email: \u201cI know that Parliament has other matters at hand at the moment, however the solution to this \u201cBury/Bolton/who\u2019s next?\u201d crisis ultimately will lay in its hands,\u201d writes Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cThe time truly has come for clubs to be given the option of community ownership similar to the NFL\u2019s Green Bay Packers. The argument against it generally runs: \u2018How can the town council of Bury be expected to compete for players and other resources against oil sheiks and American billionaires?\u2019\u201d \u201cMight I suggest a special 5% tax levy on all broadcast and licensing revenues spanning both the Premier League and EFL with said resources held in a special fund to manage buy-outs (escaping owners would be given what they paid \u2013 enjoy your one quid Mr Dale) and a certain percentage held as zero interest loans for community-owned clubs to renovate grounds, hire staff, and transfer in players. \u201cThis is all off the top of my head so there may be flaws, but you have to start somewhere.\u201d Well? Let\u2019s all start picking holes in Hubert\u2019s, on the face of it, eminently sensible suggestion. I\u2019ll get the ball rolling by asking why he thinks the solution to this crisis will end up in Parliament\u2019s hands? And even if it does, why does he think they will make anything other than a complete dog\u2019s breakfast of solving it? Andy Holt tweets: The chairman and major shareholder of Accrington Stanley, Andy Holt is one of the good guys when it comes to club ownership and his club is lucky to have him in charge, when so many others are owned by spivs, hucksters and charlatans. This informative thread he posted on Twitter is well worth a couple of minutes of your time. What with the expulsion of Bury from the Football League being such an emotive issue, we\u2019ve been unable to open the comments on this live blog today. Social media suggests that football fans around the world have plenty to say on the matter, much of it extremely heartfelt and \u2013 sadly \u2013 potentially libellous. However, we would like to hear from you, so feel free to ping me a tweet or email, or share your reaction to Bury\u2019s collapse and explain what it means to you in the bespoke form below. Thanks! More fans are gathering, sheltering from the rain beside turnstiles which only 24 hours ago showed ticket prices for Saturday\u2019s now-abandoned game against Doncaster Rovers. Some fans are huddled under umbrellas, checking their phones for the latest news; others are just here because it feels like the right place to be today. Tamoor Tariq, the deputy leader of Bury council, said his local authority was ready to support the club any way it can to ensure its survival, starting with reassuring fans about the future of its stadium, a fixture here since 1884. He said: \u201cI want to be absolutely clear that if anyone thinks there will be any development on that site any time soon then they are totally misguided - planning law doesn\u2019t allow it, the fact that it\u2019s an asset of community value also means there are restrictions governing it.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t be drawn on whether the council would chip in to help buy the club if supporters formed a Community Interest Company (like at Darlington FC in 2013) but he pointed out that the authority was also in financial difficulty, having suffered massive budget cuts since 2010. Asked whether a fan-owned club looked was the most likely way forward for Bury FC, Tariq said: \u201cSomething needs to change. The immediate thing that need to happen is Mr Dale needs to depart from the club, he needs to give up all of his links and he needs to decide how quickly he\u2019s going to do that and allow - whether it\u2019s the fans or another buyer - other people to lead the ship. It\u2019s a sorry state of affairs that he\u2019s allowed this situation to develop because he entered negotiations with C&amp;N at a very late stage. Had he been open to dialogue at an earlier stage maybe the outcome last night would have been different.\u201d Conclusion: Going by what Jevans says, it seems that unless their hand is forced, the EFL will do precisely nothing to get their house in something approaching order in the wake of Bury\u2019s expulsion. More than half of the 71 remaining league clubs outside the Premier League are living beyond their means and with the turkeys who run many of them extremely unlikely to vote for Christmas, what happened to Bury will inevitably happen to other clubs. Lots of other clubs. More from David Conn: \u201cThere is no commitment to independent regulation, nor to any form of investigation into the details of what has happened at Bury,\u201d he says, following his chat with Jevans. \u201cShe says they will receive information from C &amp; N Sporting Risk who did due diligence, and then consider any further action or investigation. The EFL is conducting a governance review, which will examine the \u2018fit and proper persons\u2019 owners and directors test and the financial regulations; she declined to make any suggestions herself for reforms it should consider.\u201d David Conn tweets. He\u2019s been talking to Debbie Jevans and the Football League\u2019s executive chair says she\u2019s \u201cdevastated\u201d by the her organisation\u2019s decision to expel Bury from the Football League. But no so devastated that she\u2019s prepared to do anything to stop it happening other clubs beyond making vague noises about asking them to control their costs. Good luck with that, Debbie! A tweet from Ivan Lewis: The Independent MP for Bury South remains convinced that Bury can and should still be saved from expulsion from the Football League. Josh Halliday, the Guardian\u2019s North of England correspondent who steered me in the direction of the Tweet, says he has spoken to Tamoor Tariq, the deputy leader of Bury council, who demanded that owner Steve Dale relinquish control of the club and urged the EFL to rethink its decision. \u201cMany fans have expressed concerns that Gigg Lane, Bury\u2019s home since 1885, could be sold off and turned into flats given the club\u2019s collapse,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut Tariq guaranteed that the council would not let that happen. There are planning laws in place, he said, to protect Gigg Lane as a sporting ground and Bury FC as a community institution.\u201d A Bury FC player speaks. Speaking to Talksport earlier this morning, Bury\u2019s 33-year-old midfielder Stephen Dawson seemed resigned to having to sell his house. \u201cI\u2019ve been onto the mortgage adviser this morning because that is the end,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no two ways about it now, that is it for me. \u201cI\u2019ve played my whole career and put everything into my house and my kids to give them a start in life when they are 18, whether that be a deposit for a house or money for college. \u201cI don\u2019t have the fancy cars or the fancy clothes as I was never in a position to earn the thousands and thousands the really good players earn.\u201d The week before last, Dawson and Bury owner Steve Dale had a frank and bad-tempered exchange of views on the radio station, in which Dale openly rubbished the notion that Dawson might have to sell his home to make ends meet. Horse bolts, MP wants to know why stable door was left open: Damian Collins has called for a full review of the English Football League\u2019s role in Bury\u2019s demise. The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, claimed the EFL has let Bury\u2019s fans down after expelling the club from its competition and said new laws were needed to safeguard other clubs from potential rogue owners. \u201cThe process run by @efl has failed fans of @buryfcofficial &amp; may do the same to @OfficialBWFC,\u201d the MP for Folkestone and Hythe, tweeted. \u201cNext week CommonsCMS will discuss how we can review the role of the football authorities in this crisis &amp; what new powers are needed to act against bad owners and directors of clubs.\u201d Greetings, one and all. The broadcaster Jim White shipped a lot of abuse on social media yesterday for standing in front of a Sky Sports News graphic of a countdown clock, as he reported on the goings-on at Bury and Bolton. Assorted viewers accused him and the network that employs him of appearing to revel in Bury\u2019s demise in the tackiest manner imaginable. Well, this morning on his Talksport show, Jim addressed the issue. He said that while he appreciated that people might have found the graphic tacky, he has no control over behind-the-scenes production at Sky. He also went on to address the crusading he has done on behalf of Bury and Bolton fans on Talksport in recent weeks, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what we do\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been after answers constantly on this, fearlessly, I may say,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pursued [Ken] Anderson, [Laurence] Bassini, [Steve] Dale, the EFL and the PFA. I don\u2019t do it for me, I do it because I\u2019m given this opportunity at Talksport to do it for the fans to give you answers that you want. \u201cAnd for some reason they talk to us and that\u2019s what I want. The important thing today is Bolton and Bury, not some ticking clock.\u201d Jim finished up by having a right go at somebody on Twitter posting under a made-up name who claimed he was revelling in Bury\u2019s demise. Full disclosure: I know Jim, albeit barely. I am also a colleague of his at Talksport, although I have only ever done one show with him. While I suspect a man of his status might have more clout than he is letting on when it comes to the behind-the-scenes goings-on at Sky Sports News when it comes to shows he is presenting, I genuinely can\u2019t think of any other national broadcaster who has done more in recent weeks to highlight the peril in which Bury and Bolton find themselves. The people criticising him for apparently \u201crevelling\u201d in Bury\u2019s demise seem strangely reluctant to acknowledge those efforts. Time for me to hand over to Barry Glendenning. He\u2019ll keep you updated on events in Bury for the rest of the day. \u201cI shed tears this morning when I read about Bury FC\u2019s demise,\u201d John Harker says. \u201cThat surprised me. Why I asked myself as a Sheffield United supporter celebrating life in the Premier League, should I care about a lower league club I have no connection to, do not support and never will. \u201cThe answer is I think because I love the game, its history and traditions. I am connected to Bury and to Bolton Wanderers as is everyone who loves the game in this country whether we know it or not. No man is an island, just as no football club is an island. There but for the grace of God go we. Every football supporter knows that in his/her heart of hearts. They know it even more this morning. \u201cThe only crumb of comfort I can offer those loyal supporters is that this isn\u2019t necessarily the end. Look at Accrington Stanley just up the road. It took time but it can be done. The best of luck to you.\u201d Neil Danns, the Bury FC captain who helped win the club promotion last season, said the club\u2019s collapse had \u201cdamaged many, many lives\u201d and called for \u201cthe powers that be\u201d to be held accountable. He told BBC Radio Manchester: \u201cDevastated is an understatement. You see some of the staff members that have been working thee for years in turmoil and wondering what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s been something I wouldn\u2019t wish on any fan or player.\u201d Danns said owner Steve Dale had contacted him earlier this summer and assured him that \u201ceverything was going to be okay\u201d despite mounting questions over the club\u2019s finances. He said questions now need to be asked of Dale, the previous owner Stewart Day, and the EFL. He added: \u201cPeople have got to stand up and be accountable because it\u2019s damaged many, many lives. You see people crying outside the ground, young fans waking up this morning with no football team, and that\u2019s a sad, sad situation in this day and age ... There\u2019s definite questions that have to be asked, not just of the owner and previous owners but also the powers that be.\u201d Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee and MP for Folkestone and Hythe Damian Collins has said the role of the football authorities and any possible changes to power will be reviewed in the House of Commons next week. EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans admitted rescheduling five postponed matches became a major factor in reaching the decision to expel Bury from the Football League. This is an action that was taken, that was done with much regret and I\u2019m feeling devastated to be here talking to you. We simply ran out of time, having already postponed five matches, it would have been six matches. We were struggling to fit that in and it was with deep regret that we just couldn\u2019t go on anymore. We went into everything that was sent to us with detail, trying to do everything that we could to save the club.\u201d Jevans admitted that the EFL \u201cneeds to learn some lessons\u201d and she believes lower league clubs should consider the option of a salary cap. We need to sit back, we need to look back, we need to learn some lessons. I\u2019m speaking personally, I\u2019m speaking for myself here. I think absolutely we need to look at the spend of clubs as much as the revenues, and looking at salary caps is absolutely something that I think the clubs should consider.\u201d Bolton have confirmed that \u201cany plans that may have been made for the immediate closure of the club have been put on hold\u201d by the administrator. A petition calling for the creation of an independent regulator for football has almost 6000 signatures. Former Wigan chairman David Sharpe has offered his sympathy to Bury. An email. \u201cA very sad day for Bury FC, their supporters and the town,\u201d David Roberts says. \u201cAs a lifelong Hereford United fan I know what you are going through and the anger and frustration. There is however light at the end of the tunnel\u2026..we rose from the ashes as a phoenix club, Hereford FC, and started over again. A long road back but one to look forward to. Keep the faith!!!!!!!!\u201d The Bolton Wanderers Supporters Trust has sent its \u201cheartfelt sympathy\u201d to Bury fans and offered any help it can this morning. The mutual support shown by fans of both financially-stricken clubs, north-west rivals who were due to play each other a week on Saturday, has been brilliant to see. This is without doubt a sad day for Bury FC, their supporters and the local community. We appreciate how hard this decision has been for all parties involved. Following on from their expulsion from the English Football League, Bury FC will no longer be able to participate in the Emirates FA Cup for the 2019/20 season. We are therefore now consulting with our stakeholders regarding the first round proper following their exit from the league. If the club re-forms we look forward to them applying to make an application to The Football Association to re-join league competition further down the English football pyramid from the 2020/21 season. Sports minister Nigel Adams has said the EFL must look into the circumstances surrounding Bury\u2019s plight. This is a very dark day for English football. It is a tragedy for the fans of Bury, the local community and everyone connected with the historic club. There will be a huge amount of anger and disbelief about how this happened. I have been in regular contact with the EFL and it is right that they closely review the processes at Bury to see if any lessons can be learned. The club\u2019s passionate fans don\u2019t deserve to go through this. I hope once the dust has settled they can begin to rebuild and take inspiration from other clubs that have done so before them.\u201d Here\u2019s a strongly worded thread on Twitter from Accrington Stanley owner Andy Holt. The PFA have released a statement on Bury\u2019s expulsion from the Football League. It is with great sadness to hear that Bury have been expelled from the English Football League after a takeover bid from C&amp;N Sporting Risk collapsed. We have been in regular communication with the players, the EFL and the club over the last eight months to try and protect our members and secure a long-term future for Bury FC. Unfortunately, despite our efforts to support the process, the club has been unable to fulfill its financial commitments or complete a possible take-over deal. This will be a desperately sad time for Bury\u2019s players and staff. We will continue to support all our members who have been impacted by the current situation, including former players, the remaining players who are contracted at the club and also those who were hoping to sign contracts. Our thoughts in particular go out to the supporters, the town and the wider community who will be devastated by this news. Our reporter David Conn wrote a damning piece on the Bury debacle yesterday. After such grinding and unnecessary failures precipitating expulsion from the Football League for Bury, a 134-year-old club founded by late Victorian civic-minded chaps in 1885, there have to be inquiries, lessons learned and reforms. The English Football League has promised to upgrade its rules to prevent such an implosion ever happening again. The Labour MP for Bury North, James Frith, who has worked relentlessly to expose ugly truths and to help save the club, has called for investigations and parliamentary scrutiny. The two modern, analytical young football men, Rory Campbell and Henry Newman, who decided not to proceed with their deadline-day proposed purchase, made clear in their statement that stronger governance is needed and the Bury wreckage was the result of \u201csystemic failings ... over a number of years\u201d. That appeared to be a diplomatically worded signal that they had been quite appalled by what they had found in the ruins of a stalwart EFL club. In particular, alongside the insolvency which resulted in a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) denying suppliers, HMRC and other creditors 75% of the money Bury owed them, and the still outstanding wages due to players who won promotion last season, was a mortgage on Gigg Lane which Campbell and Newman appear to have found repellent. The FA have announced that Bury will not be involved in this season\u2019s FA Cup. They would have entered the first round in November. If you\u2019re a Bury fan, what do you do without football on a Saturday? This could happen to fans of any lower league club, you know. A football club plays such a crucial role in a local community and means so much to so many people. It\u2019s part of their lives. You never think it won\u2019t be there. What do you do without it? In other grim news Bolton Wanderers could yet go the same way as Bury. They have been given 14 days to find a buyer. Bury captain Neil Danns delivered a strong message to owner Steve Dale yesterday. \u201cI would say look what you\u2019ve done. This should never have happened. If you thought you could not move this club forward in a positive way you should never have taken over because you\u2019ve literally destroyed lives, because that\u2019s what this football club meant to so many fans. When you see the devastation of the fans I just think I have to say something. It\u2019s unbelievable. I still can\u2019t believe it. We have been in as normal, training. I don\u2019t think anyone really believed that this was going to happen. We were just preparing every single week as though the next game was going to be on, the next game was going to be on. For it to happen so suddenly, it\u2019s still really unbelievable. For a club with so much history and that has added so much to the league, for it to just be gone like that is just unimaginable.\u201d Danns was captain of the side that won promotion from League Two last season. I\u2019ve come to have a special bond with the fans and created some amazing memories, especially last year. At this moment in time I just feel for them the most because you have got people who have been going to the game for years. It\u2019s like every story, you go to the game with your Grandad, your Mum, your Dad, your brothers, it\u2019s such a community. It means so much to people. For me, it\u2019s starting to hit me harder because I have got young sons myself. I know what it is like to take them to watch my boyhood team Liverpool and the bond that gives us. To see that taken away from future fans is just devastating. Football brings not just football on the pitch but it is so much more than that. This whole situation just does not feel real.\u201d Dave Giffard, the chair of Forever Bury Supporters Club, says that fans are discussing their next move. We have got a meeting this morning to look at our next move. What we would like to do is try and save this football club. If we have to restart as a phoenix club we would like to get hold of this ground. We have the support of the council.\u201d Hello. This is a dark day for English football. Bury have been expelled from the Football League after 125 years of membership after after the EFL board finally ran out of patience with its financial collapse and owner, Steve Dale. The deadline for the club to find a new owner passed on Tuesday afternoon, with a proposed sale to C&amp;N Sporting Risk collapsing earlier in the day. Shame on Dale, shame on the EFL, shame on the Football Association. We\u2019ll have rolling reaction here today as Bury supporters reel from the shock of their club\u2019s expulsion from the league.",

The biggest party, Fretilin, unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975. Indonesia, which was already carrying out secret attacks across the border from West Timor, invaded nine days later.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Why were the East Timorese so opposed to Indonesian rule?</b></p>\n    <p>Portugal\u2019s colonial influence meant the population was culturally very different from the rest of Indonesia. The vast majority of East Timorese are devout Catholics and speak their own language (Tetun).</p>\n    <p><b>What happened after the invasion?</b></p>\n    <p>The world largely looked the other way and some 200,000 people died over the next 24 years of Indonesian occupation. In July 1976 Indonesia\u2019s parliament declared East Timor the country\u2019s 27th province.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>What happened to the Timorese resistance?</b></p>\n    <p>The armed resistance was decimated and, in 1992, its leader, Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, was captured and imprisoned in Jakarta. Exiled leaders, like Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, kept up the fight. In 1996 Ramos-Horta shared the Nobel peace prize with the head of the Catholic church in East Timor, Bishop Carlos Belo. But the brutal occupation continued.</p>\n    <p><b>Why did Indonesia change its stance towards East Timor?</b></p>\n    <p>In 1998 Indonesia's President Suharto, in power for 30 years, resigned amid the Asian financial crisis and massive pro-democracy protests in Jakarta. His successor, BJ Habibie, was more open to some form of autonomy for East Timor. In March 1999 he announced that if the East Timorese favoured independence over autonomy under Indonesia, he would grant it.</p>\n    <p><b>What happened in the referendum and its aftermath?</b></p>\n    <p>On 30 August 1999 the UN oversaw an historic ballot, in which 78.5% of East Timorese rejected autonomy in favour of independence. Indonesian-backed militia groups who had terrorised the population before the vote stepped up their attacks, aided by Indonesian security forces. A three-week campaign of violence killed 2,600 people, nearly 30,000 were displaced and as many as 250,000 <a href=\"https://www.etan.org/etanpdf/2006/CAVR/Chega!-Report-Executive-Summary.pdf\">were forcibly shipped over the border to Indonesian West Timor</a>, in what amounted to a scorched-earth policy.</p>\n    <p><b>How did the world respond?</b></p>\n    <p>On 20 September 1999 an Australian-led international peacekeeping force, Interfet, arrived to restore order.

      "bodyText": "The US government knew for months that Indonesia\u2019s military was supporting and arming militias in East Timor in the lead-up to the 1999 independence referendum but continued to push for stronger military ties, declassified documents have revealed. The hundreds of documents provide a window into US policy on the months of terror inflicted on the Timorese and the \u201cmuted\u201d attempts by the US to convince Indonesian officials to allow a peaceful and free vote to proceed. The formerly classified documents are released in a briefing book by the National Security Archive\u2019s researcher Brad Simpson on Friday to coincide with the 20th anniversary of East Timor\u2019s independence referendum on 30 August 1999. They reveal extensive and early awareness within the US government of the Indonesian military (formerly ABRI, now TNI) and its \u201cdetermination to thwart an independence vote in East Timor through terror and violence\u201d. State department v Pentagon Clinton Fernandes, a professor of international and political studies at the University of New South Wales, said the documents illustrated a split between the US state department concerned with the TNI-backed militia violence and the Pentagon striving to preserve a military relationship in the face of widespread opposition. Fernandes said one key document \u2013 describing a meeting between US secretary of defence William Cohen and the Indonesian commander of the armed forces, General Wiranto, less than two weeks after International Force for East Timor (Interfet) forces landed in East Timor \u2013 starkly demonstrated that it was the military which mattered to Indonesia. \u201cAs long as there was the dual policy \u2013 state department v Pentagon \u2013 there were no practical consequences from the state department so Indonesia believed they could get away with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s when the defence department \u2013 Cohen \u2013 steps in that it changes things.\u201d Cohen flew to Indonesia and met with Wiranto on 30 September, a month after East Timorese voted overwhelmingly for independence despite months of violence and intimidation only to be met with more from Indonesian military and local pro-integration militias. Thousands had died. According to a state department cable, Wiranto claimed the situation in East Timor had been \u201cgreatly exaggerated by the media\u201d and that now the Australian-led peacekeeping force, Interfet, had been deployed the situation was under control. He continued to deny the TNI had backed militias. Cohen responded he would \u201chave to be quite direct and said while TNI had done \u201csome positive things\u201d it had all been overshadowed by events in East Timor. \u201cGeneral Wiranto had indicated that some people might have been dissatisfied by the results of the polls, but that could never justify the rampage which had followed,\u201d the cable described Cohen\u2019s words. It was widely believed TNI supported the militia, and Cohen was also concerned of indications militias were considering targeting Interfet. \u201cSuch actions would be tragic if they were allowed.\u201d He concluded by saying it was in both nations\u2019 interests to have a positive bilateral relationship but that would not be possible unless Indonesia made progress. Cohen\u2019s \u201creading of the riot act\u201d, as Fernandes described it, intended to drive home an announcement three weeks earlier by US president Bill Clinton that they would now cut all military ties with Indonesia. The decisive action by Clinton and Cohen came, nevertheless, after more than a year of the US working to maintain military ties despite growing evidence of human rights abuses, especially in East Timor. As violence escalated, state department officials, including the US assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, Stanley Roth, lobbied Indonesia to rein in the militias. \u201cBut US military officials resisted efforts to pressure the Indonesian armed forces and opposed efforts to reduce military aid, convinced that the Indonesian military remained a crucial force for political and military stability in the archipelago during a fragile democratic transition,\u201d Simpson said. Indonesia armed militias before vote In January 1999, the new Indonesian president, BJ Habibie, announced that East Timor could have wide-ranging autonomy or quick separation from Indonesia. However, his government was unwilling to let a UN-led international force in before it was decided. \u201cGeneral Wiranto has stated \u2026 publicly \u2026 that the military will dutifully support the government\u2019s decision, but many suspect the military\u2019s support is lukewarm at best,\u201d an embassy briefing said. The assessment was right, and hundreds of documents spanning months, reveal US officials had gathered evidence and formed the view the Indonesian military was arming militias. In February 1999, a state department intelligence report quoted Jakarta embassy officials saying the Indonesian military was \u201carming small, roving bands of East Timorese paramilitary groups\u201d and that plainclothes military personnel were participating directly in those groups. In March, military intelligence noted \u201cclose ties\u201d between the military and local militias, \u201cmany created by Indonesian Special Forces and Intelligence officers\u201d. It specifically mentioned \u201cWiranto\u2019s decision in early 1999 to provide hundreds of weapons to militia groups\u201d. It said local district headquarters had supplied ammunition, logistics, and advice. By April, the situation in East Timor had drastically deteriorated. In the days after the 6 April massacre in Liquica, Roth wrote to independence leader Xanana Gusm\u00e3o and said he had repeatedly \u201curged the Indonesian government to disarm the civilian militia\u201d and would do again. He also warned Gusmao of his own rhetoric perhaps fanning tension. Violence worsened and diplomatic cables showed warnings from Portuguese sources that attacks were expected on the weekend of 16 April \u2013 when pro-integration militias took control of Dili with the support of Indonesian security forces, including sharing transport, and committed the Carrascalao massacre. The military and police took \u201cno steps to stop the violence\u201d with a military commander reportedly declaring the military \u201cneutral\u201d, an embassy briefing said. A morning rally heard calls for a cleansing of the civil service and declared war on \u201cany international presence in East Timor, especially journalists\u201d. Roth immediately contacted Indonesia\u2019s foreign minister, Ali Alatas, and noted \u201ca lot of weapons found there way from the military to paramilitary groups\u201d. While he was not saying Wiranto or Habibie were directly involved \u201cthere were just too many reports of the [military] cooperating with the militias\u201d, and there had to be a disarming of both sides. \u201cABRI continues to take little or no action to suppress violence in areas of unrest,\u201d read a military intelligence summary about the estimated killing of more than 50 people in three days. By late April, the EU was joining calls for Indonesia to allow the UN in. In early May, the CIA added its assessment that Habibie\u2019s plans for East Timor had little support among senior military, including Wiranto. \u201cWiranto \u2026 has taken no action against the pro-integration civilian militias or discipline against local military units that, if not abetting, have at the least tolerated these groups,\u201d it said. \u201cWiranto has repeatedly promised that the military is a neutral force, but local commanders would have required at least tacit approval from headquarters in Jakarta to allow the militias the blatant free hand they have enjoyed.\u201d Diplomacy fails to quell violence American officials were clearly aware TNI was supporting the militias, but diplomatic urgings were having no effect. The following month, as the UN mission in East Timor (Unamet) prepared to deploy to oversee the referendum, UN spokesmen were publicly critical of Indonesia\u2019s handling of East Timor. Embassy officials were told \u201ccredible\u201d reports that Kopassus \u2013 TNI special forces \u2013 had directed militia agents to kidnap or harm a Unamet member, and that it was standard operating procedure for the military to \u201coutsource its dirty work to the militias\u201d. A Unamet political officer told embassy staff they realised critical statements would produce a sharp reaction but \u201cit had become clear that remonstrations with the military behind closed doors yielded nothing\u201d, and that the unacceptable situation in East Timor was worsening. On 21 May, embassy officers were told it was a common belief that \u201cmilitias planned to \u2018welcome\u2019 the first contingent of Unamet police advisors with their guns. Embassy staff visited Liquica in June and reported \u201cit is clear that the Indonesian military and pro-integration militias, working together closely, are carrying out a scorched earth policy\u201d. In July, Unamet officers told Roth and the US ambassador militias were \u201cmerely symptoms of the larger problem of the TNI\u2019s overall strategy\u201d. It was \u201cbeyond dispute\u201d that TNI was orchestrating militia activity, a redacted Unamet official said, adding that their assessments were based on firsthand observations and a large volume of evidence from the field. On 30 August, the Timorese voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence. Days later an INR report described continuing military violence. It was \u201cunclear whether Jakarta is now committed to restraining the militias it created\u201d, it said. \u201cAlso unclear is whether the current rampages are part of a campaign to derail the process or reflect a last gasp by gangs who fear the military will abandon them.\u201d Numerous documents reported on the military-backed militias and their \u201cscorched earth\u201d attacks on East Timor, including leaving Dili \u201clooted, gutted, and gone\u201d. The US was pushed into more decisive action and on 9 September Bill Clinton suspended US military relations and assistance with Indonesia. Behind closed doors Admiral Dennis Blair met with Wiranto, describing the US as a \u201cfriend\u201d to Indonesia, urging him to accept a multinational force, noting Indonesia would still control the territory until they arrived. Members of Interfet began arriving in late September, and killings continued despite Interfet\u2019s presence, as TNI soldiers burned and murdered on their way out. Just 10 days after Interfet arrived, Cohen sat down with Wiranto. \u201cHaving let Interfet in, the TNI after 24 years in Timor was not going to immediately internalise the new reality,\u201d Fernandes said. \u201cHence Cohen\u2019s warning that Indonesia must not interfere with Interfet\u2019s work. Institutions especially authoritarian ones like the TNI don\u2019t turn around monolithically.\u201d TNI backed off and Interfet was able to hand over to the UN transitional administration the next month.",

Lawyers for Jack Ritchie\u2019s parents, Charles and Liz, who founded the Gambling with Lives charity after their son\u2019s death in 2017, successfully argued that the inquest should engage article 2 of the European convention on human rights, which concerns the right to life. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) fought against the use of article 2, which is typically applied in cases where the state fails to protect the deceased person from risk, such as deaths in police custody. The ruling by Christopher Dorries, the coroner for South Yorkshire West, means the Ritchies\u2019 lawyers can seek an inquest verdict that blames the government for not providing proper medical care for addicts or sufficient information about the dangers of gambling. \u201cThe arguable case here is that the state had not provided the opportunity of meaningful medical or psychiatric treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, it is arguable that there was a systemic dysfunction in the lack of such provision.\u201d Dorries also pointed to \u201cthe apparent lack of information that might assist families or others to save their loved ones\u201d. The Ritchies\u2019 lawyers are expected to argue that lobbying by the gambling industry may have been instrumental in preventing tighter regulation. A date for the inquest has not yet been set.

A spokesperson for the Ritchies told the Guardian: \u201cCharles and Liz are pleased that the failure of the state to protect their son\u2019s life will now come under intensive scrutiny and welcome the potential of this inquest to save many lives in the future. \u201cThere is evidence of a long-established and understood link between gambling addiction and suicide, of which the state was aware prior to Jack\u2019s death.

The spokesperson said there was evidence that the state had \u201cfailed, over many years, to regulate the dangerous activity of gambling adequately\u201d, particularly with regard to FOBTs. Maximum stakes on these machines were cut from \u00a3100 to \u00a32 this year after the government acknowledged they were a \u201csocial blight\u201d, after a long-running campaign against them.

A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are currently considering the decision and cannot comment further at this time.\u201d In his ruling, Dorries said he was \u201cdeeply cautious of the inquest appearing to become involved in the political aspects of safeguarding potential problem gamblers, for it cannot and must not do so.\u201d But there could be significant ramifications for gambling regulation if the inquest determines that the state was partly to blame. Any verdict that finds that the public is not receiving sufficient warnings about the dangers of gambling could force the government to impose smoking-style warnings on gambling products. Measures are already being developed to improve the treatment opportunities on offer to addicts. The first of 14 planned specialist gambling addiction NHS clinics is due to open shortly. There are 55,000 children classed as having a gambling problem in Britain, according to the Gambling Commission, which also found that 450,000 were gambling regularly \u2013 more than the number who said they had taken drugs, drunk alcohol or smoked. Recent studies have drawn links between gambling addiction and increase likelihood of suicide. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. In the US, the suicide prevention lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. Other international helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org.",

      "bodyText": "The Russian government has denied responsibility for the killing of a Chechen exile in Berlin after German authorities reportedly voiced suspicions of a state-backed attack similar to that carried out against a former Russian military officer in Salisbury, Britain, in 2018. Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, who fought against Russia during the second Chechen war in the early 2000s, was shot twice in the head at close range in the Kleiner Tiergarten park in central Berlin just before midday last Friday. Associates of Khangoshvili said he commanded a fighting unit against Russian troops between 1999 and 2004. After the end of the conflict, Khangoshvili moved back to Georgia where he was employed as a mediator by the anti-terror unit of the Georgian interior ministry. He continued to help the Chechen insurgency and continued to be regarded as a terrorist by Russia\u2019s intelligence agency, the FSB. From his base in Georgia, Khangoshvili helped to send supplies over the mountains into Chechnya and to evacuate wounded fighters, his associates said. However, they insisted he was not a radical or an Islamist. \u201cHe was always against Chechens going to fight in Syria or Afghanistan; he thought our only battle was with Russia,\u201d said Saikhan Muzayev, who knew Khangoshvili from Georgia and saw him in Berlin three months ago. A suspect named in the German media as Vadim S was arrested by Berlin police before he could leave the scene of the crime on an electric scooter parked in a nearby bush. Two 17-year-olds had reportedly seen the man throwing a Glock handgun with a silencer, a bicycle and a wig into the river Spree and alerted the authorities. Ekkehard Maa\u00df, a former East German dissident songwriter who now chairs the German-Caucasian Society, said he had met Khangoshvili when he first arrived in Germany at the end of 2016 and had personally appealed to the authorities in January 2017 to grant him special protection. Khangoshvili arrived in Germany after six months in Ukraine, having fled Georgia after surviving two assassination attempts there, one by poison in 2009 and one where he was shot at eight times while driving his car in central Tbilisi in May 2015, said Maa\u00df. \u201cZelimkhan thought that now he was in Germany he would be safe, and every Friday he took the same route from his home to the mosque. He must have been noticed, and the information passed to the killer,\u201d said Maa\u00df. Khangoshvili, who lived in Berlin under a pseudonym, had three daughters and two sons aged between two and 17. A small memorial was held in Berlin on Tuesday before his body was flown back to Georgia. Muzayev, who attended the ceremony and took part in the Chechen ritual of washing the body before the funeral, said he saw one bullet wound in the shoulder and two in the head. \u201cHe was shot in the shoulder and fell to the ground, and then he was finished off,\u201d he said. When he was caught by the police, the alleged assassin, a 49-year-old Russian citizen from Siberia, had changed his outfit to blend in as a tourist, wearing a pink shirt, sandals and a neck pouch containing a passport and a large amount of cash. A rucksack that police recovered from the river contained a shaving kit and paprika powder, which can be used to throw sniffer dogs off a scent. Vadim S, who had only arrived in Berlin a few days before the killing, has denied responsibility for the killing and reportedly refused to answer questions. According to Bild, the suspect requested to speak to a representative of the Russian embassy. On Wednesday the Kremlin denied any involvement in the killing, which took place on the same day that Germany\u2019s foreign minister was visiting Moscow. \u201cI categorically reject any link between this incident, this murder and official Russia,\u201d said Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. There have been numerous contract killings of Chechens across the world in recent years, with the victims usually falling into one of two categories: personal enemies of the region\u2019s Kremlin-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, or figures believed to be involved in an insurgency against Kadyrov\u2019s forces and Russian troops in the region. In the former set of cases, Chechen murder squads linked to Kadyrov have appeared to be the most likely perpetrators, while the latter hits have borne the hallmark of the Russian federal security services.

      "body": "<p>Last week, the Aurora Games took over the Times Union Center in upstate New York. Billed as an international multi-sport women\u2019s festival, the event brought together roughly 150 athletes, including Olympic champions and grand slam winners, to compete for Team Americas and Team World in tennis, gymnastics, basketball, ice hockey, figure skating, beach volleyball and table tennis.</p> <p>The mission of the Games, founded by longtime sports executive Jerry Solomon, was to create a platform to celebrate and elevate women athletes. The Aurora Games will be held every two years and has already committed to return to Albany for 2021 and 2023.</p> <p>At a time when women in sports are fighting for equitable pay on the soccer pitch, an end to sexual assault in gymnastics and more professional leagues in ice hockey, the Aurora Games set out to establish a new bar for the production of women\u2019s sports. Whether it succeeded is an open question.</p> <p>The most urgent topics in women\u2019s sports today have been pay equity, creating a professional environment and visibility. It would be difficult for the Aurora Games to successfully be a progressive women\u2019s sporting event without the participating athletes being compensated appropriately.</p> <p>Team Americas ice hockey coach and Aurora Games advisory board member Digit Murphy told the Guardian that ice hockey contracts were set at $2,500 and covered travel, meals, accommodations and other expenses.</p> <p>\u201cThey worked for four to five days and they got compensated handsomely. All their expenses are paid, all the bills are paid \u2026 we felt that it was a good number. We felt like it was more than they\u2019re getting paid for a month of the season, for a weekend.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the players participating in the Aurora Games played in the now defunct Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League or the National Women\u2019s Hockey League. In the 2018-19 season, women\u2019s pro hockey salaries in North America ranged from $2,000 to $10,000 dollars for a seven-month season.</p> <p>Murphy noted she was asked to keep her equipment budget under $10,000, but did not know exactly how much was spent on the ice hockey events. Requests made for the details of the athlete contracts, including compensation, were not offered at the time of publication.</p> <p>Women athletes largely agree pay equity is a process as opposed to a concrete destination. En route to larger salaries, women are also fighting for work conditions appropriate for world class athletes.</p> <p>\u201cMy first metric is the athletes. If the athletes say to me, \u2018Hey, thanks for doing this, but this is a stupid idea. No one\u2019s ever gonna play this again.\u2019 That\u2019s not a good metric. The feedback from the athletes so far has been exactly the opposite. That they\u2019ve been really appreciative \u2026 they\u2019ve been talking about how great of an idea it is, how important it is how, how happy they are, to be part of it to be part of the first one that is really meaningful.\u201d</p> <p>Athletes have expressed the same sentiment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing and everything around it has been good,\u201d said Swedish ice hockey player Rebecca Stenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first of its kind, so [we\u2019ll] see how it goes. I hope there\u2019s gonna be a lot more of these events and I hope that people see women\u2019s sports in another perspective.\u201d</p> <p>American figure skater Mirai Nagasu added, \u201cGrowing up, I was told \u2018I can\u2019t do that because I\u2019m a girl.\u2019 I should stick to Barbies and dolls and that\u2019s not always the case. I preferred bugs and throwing myself and taking really hard falls. Skating is a little like parkour with a lot more glitter \u2026 we put sunglasses on how hard we work. We make it look easy, that\u2019s our job. But it\u2019s really cool to be a part of something focused on women and females.\u201d</p> <p>However, there have been a few things that were not in line with creating the best athlete experience. For starters, the equipment for the first several events, most notably gymnastics and basketball, were damp from the condensation the arena ice created.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/akin9312/status/1164574955578822657\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Aurora games be like: safety?!?

The athlete also expressed concerns for the ice along the boards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ShoreScout/status/1164669682768646144\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Warmups for tonight&#39;s game! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AuroraGames?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AuroraGames</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Co94odWItB\">pic.twitter.com/Co94odWItB</a></p>&mdash; WohoFan (@ShoreScout) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShoreScout/status/1164669682768646144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 22, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>There were also reports that the beach volleyball participants were not scheduled to have practice time until the day of their event, which had an 11am start time. Reports indicated the players were not originally offered an alternative practice area but that one was secured Saturday.</p> <p>Some of these issues were likely due to all six events happening at the same arena in six consecutive days. Albany has already been secured for the 2021 and 2023 Aurora Games. However, Solomon may rethink having all the events in the same arena.</p> <p>\u201cWe probably need to be outside of one building,\u201d Solomon said ahead of Thursday\u2019s basketball event. Albany was not a first-choice destination, but was the best choice at the time. While the idea of having all the events in one building was tempting, it proved difficult.</p> <p>Another lesson from the inaugural Aurora Games is that visibility for women\u2019s sports remains an issue. Part of that is drawing on a more global market, Solomon said Thursday. Even if the Aurora Games was able to offer competitive contracts, and could offer a better venue experience for next time, did they do enough to draw in media attention in the first year?</p> <p>\u201cWhen you start to get into all this, you find out that the women get 4% of the coverage overall around the world in sports, as men. I actually don\u2019t even know how that\u2019s possible,\u201d Solomon told the Guardian.</p> <p>To combat that, the Aurora Games partnered with ESPN in their first year. In May, the network announced it would air coverage from all six nights on ESPNU and ESPNews.</p> <p>Print and online media covered the Games as well, but the press corps on hand for the events Thursday through Saturday was sparse. Some told the Guardian they felt the Aurora Games could have done a better job drumming up media attention.</p> <p>The Aurora Games had consistent local coverage and national American outlets such as espnW and The Athletic covered Lindsay Whalen, the coach of the Team Americas basketball. CBC and the Wall Street Journal, and The Telegraph also covered the sports festival. The latter two questioned whether the Games would be successful in drawing crowds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/18/katelyn-ohashis-perfect-10-reminded-america-life-could-be-fun-again-gymmastics\">Katelyn Ohashi's perfect 10 reminded America life could be fun again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Sunday, the event announced they drew an overall attendance of 20,423 over six nights, or an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kells_29/status/1163974931824226304\">average crowd of approximately 3,400</a> for each session.

I think that it\u2019s a start. There\u2019s a lot of men\u2019s teams that would like 2,000 people at their events that are just starting \u2026 I think generating the buzz and excitement, it was very well done,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Solomon added: \u201cSuccess, or lack of success, for the Aurora Games can be measured in a lot of different ways, and by different people in different ways \u2026 Here tonight, you\u2019ll see a basketball game. The one thing we know, they\u2019re great athletes, they\u2019re going to put on the best show that they can. And, you know, if you like basketball, you probably gonna have a good time tonight. But there\u2019s not gonna be a lot of people in the stands. And so, you know, the critic will say, \u2018See, there\u2019s no market for this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Solomon was right: it wasn\u2019t a great crowd. There were just over 2,500 fans on hand to watch Team World edge out Team Americas, 85-77. However, that will not convince him the event wasn\u2019t a success.</p> <p>\u201cI went to the first Super Bowl. It wasn\u2019t sold out. The tickets were cheap. And if somebody had said, well, 50 years from now, the Super Bowl is going to be the biggest thing on the planet. It would have sounded stupid.</p> <p>\u201cThe Aurora Games are named after the Roman goddess of the dawn. And Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. And so I think there are a lot of people who are very, very excited about what we\u2019re doing. And I think that we\u2019ll sort of see how it all goes.\u201d</p> <p>Drawing a conclusion as to whether the 2019 Aurora Games was successful is complicated. Criticism of the attendance and venue challenges is fair. So too is Solomon\u2019s \u201clet\u2019s wait and see\u201d approach.</p> <p>Ultimately, the six-day festival held this year is a baseline. It is natural for media to question the success of an event by clear-cut metrics like attendance, ticket sales, viewership and profitability. As of now, we only have the attendance numbers.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the 2019 Aurora Games sought to do something that has never been done and they were successful in that. One could measure the volume of attendance, sponsors or salaries for events in one of the six sports to gauge success. However, that is an apples to oranges comparison. Of course, the Olympics is the closest analogue to the Aurora Games, but with a 119-year head start. Not to mention, it includes men and women.</p> <p>Solomon sees the Aurora Games as an idea whose time has arrived. Eighteen years ago, he was approached by a group wanted to start a linear 24-hour women\u2019s sports network. Solomon didn\u2019t believe 2001 was the right time, but the idea stuck with him. By 2016, she began to see an opportunity to host a women\u2019s sporting event like none other.</p> <p>\u201cI really saw this as, this should be a platform for women athletes that shows what they\u2019re all about, because they\u2019re great. And they\u2019re entertaining. And they\u2019re personable, and they have stories, and their role models \u2026 but they get lost in the comparison to the men and in the bigness of the men,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The \u2018bigness\u2019 Solomon is referring to all revolves around money. The average baseball team, a sport many believe to be struggling to keep fans, is <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2019/04/10/baseball-team-values-2019-yankees-lead-league-at-46-billion/#2a622f7d69b2\">estimated to be worth $1.78bn</a>. Alternatively, an owner could buy a women\u2019s professional softball team for $250,000 and operate a franchise for <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidberri/2018/08/06/now-might-be-the-time-to-buy-a-womens-professional-sports-team/#41a558037be9\">roughly $1m</a>, according to sports economist David Berri.</p> <p>As of yet, we don\u2019t know if the Aurora Games made a profit or operated at a loss. It is also unclear if Solomon has fully detailed how to measure success of the first-of-its-kind event.</p> <p>However, the baseline has been set. The Games recruited over 150 athletes, secured over 20 sponsors, and drew an overall crowd of 20,000 fans. With 2019 as a guidepost and with the city of Albany already committed for two more games, Solomon and his team must move the needle.</p>",

We felt like it was more than they\u2019re getting paid for a month of the season, for a weekend.\u201d Many of the players participating in the Aurora Games played in the now defunct Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League or the National Women\u2019s Hockey League. In the 2018-19 season, women\u2019s pro hockey salaries in North America ranged from $2,000 to $10,000 dollars for a seven-month season. Murphy noted she was asked to keep her equipment budget under $10,000, but did not know exactly how much was spent on the ice hockey events. Requests made for the details of the athlete contracts, including compensation, were not offered at the time of publication. Women athletes largely agree pay equity is a process as opposed to a concrete destination. En route to larger salaries, women are also fighting for work conditions appropriate for world class athletes. \u201cMy first metric is the athletes. If the athletes say to me, \u2018Hey, thanks for doing this, but this is a stupid idea. No one\u2019s ever gonna play this again.\u2019 That\u2019s not a good metric. The feedback from the athletes so far has been exactly the opposite. That they\u2019ve been really appreciative \u2026 they\u2019ve been talking about how great of an idea it is, how important it is how, how happy they are, to be part of it to be part of the first one that is really meaningful.\u201d Athletes have expressed the same sentiment. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing and everything around it has been good,\u201d said Swedish ice hockey player Rebecca Stenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first of its kind, so [we\u2019ll] see how it goes. I hope there\u2019s gonna be a lot more of these events and I hope that people see women\u2019s sports in another perspective.\u201d American figure skater Mirai Nagasu added, \u201cGrowing up, I was told \u2018I can\u2019t do that because I\u2019m a girl.\u2019 I should stick to Barbies and dolls and that\u2019s not always the case. I preferred bugs and throwing myself and taking really hard falls. Skating is a little like parkour with a lot more glitter \u2026 we put sunglasses on how hard we work. We make it look easy, that\u2019s our job. But it\u2019s really cool to be a part of something focused on women and females.\u201d However, there have been a few things that were not in line with creating the best athlete experience. For starters, the equipment for the first several events, most notably gymnastics and basketball, were damp from the condensation the arena ice created. During Thursday\u2019s basketball shootaround and evening event, towels were placed near the benches and camera crew areas so no water made its way onto the court. During the ice hockey open clinic, a participating athlete noted there was \u201ca lot of work\u201d needed to get the ice to decent condition. The athlete also expressed concerns for the ice along the boards. There were also reports that the beach volleyball participants were not scheduled to have practice time until the day of their event, which had an 11am start time. Reports indicated the players were not originally offered an alternative practice area but that one was secured Saturday. Some of these issues were likely due to all six events happening at the same arena in six consecutive days. Albany has already been secured for the 2021 and 2023 Aurora Games. However, Solomon may rethink having all the events in the same arena. \u201cWe probably need to be outside of one building,\u201d Solomon said ahead of Thursday\u2019s basketball event. Albany was not a first-choice destination, but was the best choice at the time. While the idea of having all the events in one building was tempting, it proved difficult. Another lesson from the inaugural Aurora Games is that visibility for women\u2019s sports remains an issue. Part of that is drawing on a more global market, Solomon said Thursday. Even if the Aurora Games was able to offer competitive contracts, and could offer a better venue experience for next time, did they do enough to draw in media attention in the first year? \u201cWhen you start to get into all this, you find out that the women get 4% of the coverage overall around the world in sports, as men. I actually don\u2019t even know how that\u2019s possible,\u201d Solomon told the Guardian. To combat that, the Aurora Games partnered with ESPN in their first year. In May, the network announced it would air coverage from all six nights on ESPNU and ESPNews. Print and online media covered the Games as well, but the press corps on hand for the events Thursday through Saturday was sparse. Some told the Guardian they felt the Aurora Games could have done a better job drumming up media attention. The Aurora Games had consistent local coverage and national American outlets such as espnW and The Athletic covered Lindsay Whalen, the coach of the Team Americas basketball. CBC and the Wall Street Journal, and The Telegraph also covered the sports festival. The latter two questioned whether the Games would be successful in drawing crowds. On Sunday, the event announced they drew an overall attendance of 20,423 over six nights, or an average crowd of approximately 3,400 for each session. The Times Union Center has a maximum capacity of 17,500 with the lower bowl seating 6,000 fans, according to the Wall Street Journal. Murphy was pleased with the crowd of 2,851 fans that watched Team Americas defeat Team World in tennis on Friday night. The lineups included Rogers Cup champion Bianca Andreescu, former world No 1 Victoria Azarenka and two-time major champion Garbine Muguruza. The biggest crowd of the week was for women\u2019s gymnastics, as 4,210 watched American gymnast and viral sensation Katelyn Ohashi scored a perfect 10 on the floor exercise to help Team Americas to the victory. \u201cI feel great. I think that it\u2019s a start. There\u2019s a lot of men\u2019s teams that would like 2,000 people at their events that are just starting \u2026 I think generating the buzz and excitement, it was very well done,\u201d she said. Solomon added: \u201cSuccess, or lack of success, for the Aurora Games can be measured in a lot of different ways, and by different people in different ways \u2026 Here tonight, you\u2019ll see a basketball game. The one thing we know, they\u2019re great athletes, they\u2019re going to put on the best show that they can. And, you know, if you like basketball, you probably gonna have a good time tonight. But there\u2019s not gonna be a lot of people in the stands. And so, you know, the critic will say, \u2018See, there\u2019s no market for this.\u2019\u201d Solomon was right: it wasn\u2019t a great crowd. There were just over 2,500 fans on hand to watch Team World edge out Team Americas, 85-77. However, that will not convince him the event wasn\u2019t a success. \u201cI went to the first Super Bowl. It wasn\u2019t sold out. The tickets were cheap. And if somebody had said, well, 50 years from now, the Super Bowl is going to be the biggest thing on the planet. It would have sounded stupid. \u201cThe Aurora Games are named after the Roman goddess of the dawn. And Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. And so I think there are a lot of people who are very, very excited about what we\u2019re doing. And I think that we\u2019ll sort of see how it all goes.\u201d Drawing a conclusion as to whether the 2019 Aurora Games was successful is complicated. Criticism of the attendance and venue challenges is fair. So too is Solomon\u2019s \u201clet\u2019s wait and see\u201d approach. Ultimately, the six-day festival held this year is a baseline. It is natural for media to question the success of an event by clear-cut metrics like attendance, ticket sales, viewership and profitability. As of now, we only have the attendance numbers. It is worth noting that the 2019 Aurora Games sought to do something that has never been done and they were successful in that. One could measure the volume of attendance, sponsors or salaries for events in one of the six sports to gauge success. However, that is an apples to oranges comparison. Of course, the Olympics is the closest analogue to the Aurora Games, but with a 119-year head start. Not to mention, it includes men and women. Solomon sees the Aurora Games as an idea whose time has arrived. Eighteen years ago, he was approached by a group wanted to start a linear 24-hour women\u2019s sports network. Solomon didn\u2019t believe 2001 was the right time, but the idea stuck with him. By 2016, she began to see an opportunity to host a women\u2019s sporting event like none other. \u201cI really saw this as, this should be a platform for women athletes that shows what they\u2019re all about, because they\u2019re great. And they\u2019re entertaining. And they\u2019re personable, and they have stories, and their role models \u2026 but they get lost in the comparison to the men and in the bigness of the men,\u201d he said. The \u2018bigness\u2019 Solomon is referring to all revolves around money. The average baseball team, a sport many believe to be struggling to keep fans, is estimated to be worth $1.78bn. Alternatively, an owner could buy a women\u2019s professional softball team for $250,000 and operate a franchise for roughly $1m, according to sports economist David Berri. As of yet, we don\u2019t know if the Aurora Games made a profit or operated at a loss. It is also unclear if Solomon has fully detailed how to measure success of the first-of-its-kind event. However, the baseline has been set. The Games recruited over 150 athletes, secured over 20 sponsors, and drew an overall crowd of 20,000 fans. With 2019 as a guidepost and with the city of Albany already committed for two more games, Solomon and his team must move the needle.",

We cannot wait 200 years to decide whether his films are great or easily forgotten, an aesthetic judgment needs to be passed at once.\u201d</p> \n<p>Barbera added that he is not a \u201ccourt judge\u201d who has to say whether a man has to go to jail, saying he \u201conly [has] the right to say whether or not a film should be in a festival or not\u201d. He had previously compared Polanski to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/03/caravaggio-killed-a-man-censor-art\">Caravaggio</a>, the 17th-century artist who is thought to have <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1396127/Red-blooded-Caravaggio-killed-love-rival-in-bungled-castration-attempt.html\">murdered a love rival</a>, saying he \u201cwas a killer, but one of the major painters of the Italian baroque period. It\u2019s not so different.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lucrecia Martel, the president of the international jury at Venice, agreed that Polanski\u2019s new film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/01/roman-polanski-jaccuse-dreyfus-affair-film-outrage\">An Officer and a Spy</a>, should be included, although she disagreed with Barbera on the issue of introducing gender quotas at the festival. The lack of female directors in the main 21 entries \u2013 the only films directed by women come from Saudi director Haifaa Al Mansour (The Perfect Candidate) and Shannon Murphy (Babyteeth) \u2013 has been criticised, with Venice lagging behind other major festivals such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/cannesfilmfestival\">Cannes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/torontofilmfestival\">Toronto</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cQuotas are never satisfactory,\u201d said Martel. \u201cBut there are no other solutions to guarantee the inclusion of women or give them the position they deserve.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked the same question Barbera said he is \u201cfully against the idea of quotas for the selection of a film festival\u201d, adding that it would \u201cbe offensive because it goes against the only criterion that we have to consider, which is the quality of the film\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"531ce5bd-f02c-41ff-a51d-ef4e7576b0e8\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>The Truth<br></b>Venice\u2019s opening night spot goes to the latest film by Hirokazu Kore-eda, whose Shoplifters won top prize at Cannes last year.

At the opening press conference, Alberto Barbera \u2013 the outspoken director of the festival who is stepping down next year \u2013 said he was convinced he had made the correct choice to include Polanski despite the film-maker\u2019s conviction for raping a 13-year-old girl in 1978. \u201cThe history of art is full of artists who committed crimes but we have continued to admire their works of art and the same is true of Polanski,\u201d said Barbera. \u201cHe is, in my opinion, one of the last masters in European cinema. We cannot wait 200 years to decide whether his films are great or easily forgotten, an aesthetic judgment needs to be passed at once.\u201d Barbera added that he is not a \u201ccourt judge\u201d who has to say whether a man has to go to jail, saying he \u201conly [has] the right to say whether or not a film should be in a festival or not\u201d. He had previously compared Polanski to Caravaggio, the 17th-century artist who is thought to have murdered a love rival, saying he \u201cwas a killer, but one of the major painters of the Italian baroque period. It\u2019s not so different.\u201d Lucrecia Martel, the president of the international jury at Venice, agreed that Polanski\u2019s new film, An Officer and a Spy, should be included, although she disagreed with Barbera on the issue of introducing gender quotas at the festival. The lack of female directors in the main 21 entries \u2013 the only films directed by women come from Saudi director Haifaa Al Mansour (The Perfect Candidate) and Shannon Murphy (Babyteeth) \u2013 has been criticised, with Venice lagging behind other major festivals such as Cannes and Toronto. \u201cQuotas are never satisfactory,\u201d said Martel. \u201cBut there are no other solutions to guarantee the inclusion of women or give them the position they deserve.\u201d Asked the same question Barbera said he is \u201cfully against the idea of quotas for the selection of a film festival\u201d, adding that it would \u201cbe offensive because it goes against the only criterion that we have to consider, which is the quality of the film\u201d. The two then debated the issue, with Martel asking Barbera whether he thought that by introducing a 50/50 gender rule, Venice could trigger a change across the film industry. \u201cCan I ask Mr Barbera, just imagine a situation where we have to have a 50/50. Would the quality decrease? Or would it lead to a change in the industry? Perhaps it would be too bad if we were to implement an experiment like this?\u201d Barbera responded by saying that 23% of the films the jury considered for selection were directed by women and that until that number increased, it would be difficult to get near 50/50. He admitted that the fact that the buildup to the festival has been dominated by the gender debate had been \u201ca little bit damaging\u201d, and said he hoped he was \u201cexempt from any prejudice\u201d when selecting films for Venice. The festival opened on Wednesday morning with Hirokazu Kore-eda\u2019s first non-Japanese language film, The Truth, the story of an ageing French actor, played by Catherine Deneuve, who is coming to terms with her past and its impact on her daughter (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter\u2019s husband (Ethan Hawke). Thursday sees the premieres of James Gray\u2019s space epic Ad Astra and Noah Baumbach\u2019s Marriage Story, which is gathering Oscar buzz for lead actors Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, and is the first of three films that Netflix is showing in Venice.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Hong Kong on Wednesday to denounce Cathay Pacific for firing staff after it came under pressure from Beijing \u2013 describing the case as symptomatic of the wider intimidation of protesters and sympathisers. Businesses, pushed to voice support for the authorities, are facing a growing backlash from employees and customers who see the pressure as part of a broad strategy to wear down opposition after two and a half months of protests sparked by a controversial extradition bill. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an issue for Cathay,\u201d said one demonstrator, a retiree who gave her name as Miss Chan. \u201cThey want to [persuade] the public that if you go on a demonstration you may be punished; even if you are not arrested, you might lose employment opportunities. They are trying to expand the fear, which is already huge in Hong Kong.\u201d Protesters, many from the aviation industry, rallied in the financial district before marching to the headquarters of Swire Pacific, the airline\u2019s controlling shareholder. Later on Wednesday night thousands of protesters attended a separate rally against alleged sexual violence by police against participants in the movement. The airline was caught in the political storm when one of its pilots was charged over a protest. Its chairman initially said that \u201cwe certainly wouldn\u2019t dream of telling [our staff] what they have to think about something\u201d. But China\u2019s aviation authority told the airline it would have to remove any staff involved in or supportive of protests from flights over its airspace. A state-owned bank rated Cathay stock a strong sell and Chinese firms withdrew business. The arrested pilot was sacked and the airline\u2019s chief executive, Rupert Hogg, quit \u2013 news which, strikingly, first emerged in Chinese state media. Last week, the chair of the flight attendants union at the subsidiary Cathay Dragon said she had been sacked after managers presented her with copies of protest-related Facebook posts; the Confederation of Trade Unions plans a legal challenge. Cathay, which said that the measure was not related to her union activities, reiterated before the rally that it upheld Hong Kong\u2019s rights and freedoms but had a zero-tolerance approach \u201cto any support for or participation in illegal protests, violent activities or overly radical behaviour\u201d. The pressure on the firm was unprecedented, said David Webb, a shareholder activist and founder of Webb-site, which reports on Hong Kong affairs, adding that he was dismayed rather than surprised by the outcome. \u201cIndividually I understand why companies don\u2019t speak up. Collectively they should,\u201d he said, suggesting chambers of commerce should take a stronger stand. Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, described the extent of the pressure on companies as a \u201cturning point\u201d. Last weekend the MTR rail system closed stations along protest routes for the first time. The company and the Hong Kong government \u2013 its majority shareholder \u2013 said it was simply protecting staff and passengers, but activists noted that the decision came shortly after mainland state media accused it of having \u201carranged special trains for rioters to escape\u201d and asked whether it was \u201can accomplice to rioters\u201d. Though the business community was hostile to the extradition bill, some tycoons have recently emerged at pro- government rallies. Some protesters are boycotting the restaurants, stores or shopping malls of such figures as a result. But for many businesses, the calculation is simple. Around a fifth of Cathay\u2019s business is thought to be to the mainland \u2013 where Swire also has substantial interests \u2013 and almost all other flights pass through its airspace. Even people rallying against Cathay admitted they did not expect it to reverse its policy. \u201cOf course we won\u2019t change its mind \u2013 but it\u2019s also sending a message to other companies that we cannot let this white terror spread,\u201d said Marcel Chan, who works in the transport industry.

On Wednesday the overseas edition of the state-run People\u2019s Daily accused some Hong Kong teachers of planting radical ideas in the minds of students and said those with \u201cno ethics\u201d should be sacked. Meanwhile thousands of protesters overflowed from a park in the central business district on Wednesday night to rally against police harassment of female protesters arrested at anti-government demonstrations. Many in the female-dominated crowd scrawled #protesttoo on their bodies in lipstick while others donned purple ribbons and waved purple lights in a sign of solidarity with women who say they have been groped by police officers or abused in detention over the past three months. Headlining the rally was a female protester who at a press conference last week publicly accused police of indecent assault. She described how she had been aggressively strip-searched after her arrest. The woman said she had then undergone a humiliating cavity search by two female officers only to discover a handful of male officers were waiting immediately outside, according to Hong Kong Free Press. The protester spoke of her intense shame during the encounter. She did not disclose her identity, was dressed in a mask, sunglasses, hat and black sweatshirt, and asked for reporters to refer to her by a pseudonym \u2013 reflecting the fact that sexual harassment and gender-based violence remain largely taboo subjects for many Hongkongers. There have only been a handful of public #metoo cases in the conservative city in recent years; the most high-profile case, of the athlete Vera Lui, ended in acquittal for her coach after she accused him of sexual assault. Police violence, however, appears to have begun a city-wide conversation about sexual harassment, as both men and women carried signs with slogans such as \u201cStop Hong Kong police\u2019s use of sexual violence!\u201d While men have dominated a number of anti-government rallies over the past three months, according to a survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, female representation has averaged around 45% at 12 major protests. Wednesday\u2019s rally was the first event to specifically target women since demonstrations began in early June. \u201cI would say our culture is \u2018women should stay behind and guys to the front\u2019, so I hope this is an opportunity for us to stand out internationally,\u201d said protester Aqua Wong, who had scrawled #protesttoo on her chest above her black outfit. Other protesters reiterated their calls for an independent inquiry into police violence. While the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, has promised a fact finding study into police tactics, she has failed to deliver on public demand for a formal inquiry led by a judge. Protester Pas Lek said she thought it was \u201cfishy\u201d that the government had failed to set up an independent review despite social media posts and videos of women being mistreated, including a widely shared clip of a woman whose skirt was pushed up exposing her genitals as she was aggressively arrested. \u201cIf the police or the government insisted the police didn\u2019t do [anything wrong] then why don\u2019t they set up an independent investigation council assessing that?\u201d asked Lek. Mass protests began in Hong Kong on 9 June against a legislative bill that would have allowed for residents to stand trial in mainland China. Many protesters felt this bill would infringe on the city\u2019s autonomy, promised until 2047, under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement with Beijing. Protests, however, show no sign of ending even after Lam promised she would not move forward with the bill.",

A course with the Bristol organisation <a href=\"https://www.street2boardroom.com/\">Street2Boardroom</a>, which aims to help people to apply \u201cthe hustle\u201d they have learned on the street to legitimate business, is also available.</p> <p>Supt Andy Bennett of Avon and Somerset police said: \u201cIt was becoming clear to us in our drug enforcement work that these young level-one street dealers are not doing this by choice. They are dealing because others are putting them up to it.

      "bodyText": "Young people caught drug-dealing in Bristol are being offered the chance to access job training, driving lessons and even gym membership rather than being charged and hauled before a court. Avon and Somerset police say the scheme is the only one of its kind in the country and is designed to divert youngsters away from gangs, prison and a possible life of crime. The force accepts the project will attract criticism and flies in the face of the national illegal drugs strategy, which focuses on enforcement through the criminal justice system. But it argues that if the pilot scheme works and is extended, hundreds of youngsters on the fringe of a life in crime could be saved from jail. It also points out that if any of the youngsters taking part get into more trouble or fail to engage properly, they are arrested and face prosecution for the original offence. The programme of activities includes access to workshops, motivational speaking events and one-to-one mentoring. A course with the Bristol organisation Street2Boardroom, which aims to help people to apply \u201cthe hustle\u201d they have learned on the street to legitimate business, is also available. Supt Andy Bennett of Avon and Somerset police said: \u201cIt was becoming clear to us in our drug enforcement work that these young level-one street dealers are not doing this by choice. They are dealing because others are putting them up to it. They are absolutely being exploited.\u201d Bennett said the force wondered if, by putting such young people on a rigorous six- to nine-month course rather than charging them, it could lead to them getting apprenticeships or jobs and divert them from crime. He said he realised some would be sceptical. \u201cThe rhetoric around at the moment is about locking them up and throw away the key.\u201d Bennett said for some this approach was appropriate but not necessarily for youngsters without a record for violence who were being forced into dealing. The scheme launched in February and so far 17 youngsters aged 16 to 19 have taken part. Two have so far lost their places. One was found dealing drugs and will appear in court next month, and another was caught with a knife. But the first graduate is due to complete the scheme in a few weeks\u2019 time. \u201cThe strong indication is that it\u2019s working,\u201d said Bennett. Before a person can be accepted on to the scheme, the police present the case to the Crown Prosecution Service. If it assesses that the case would almost certainly lead to prosecution, a local protocol allows the police to offer the suspect a place on the project. Bennett said: \u201cThe government has told us that while it doesn\u2019t fit neatly into drugs strategy, we have operational authority to make decisions like this.\u201d Participants are handpicked by a panel and must not have any previous convictions for sexual or violent offences. The force said the trial scheme would be subject to a \u201crigorous review process\u201d and independent academic evaluation to judge its success and sustainability and the impact on gang- and drug-related crime. A spokesperson said: \u201cThere is no other scheme in the country that deals with drug-dealing offences in this way.

This gripping thriller is written and directed by Vince Gilligan, the creator of Breaking Bad. The movie is produced by Mark Johnson, Melissa Bernstein, Charles Newirth, Diane Mercer and Aaron Paul, in association with Sony Pictures Television.</em>\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Who\u2019s in it and who\u2019s behind it?</strong></h2> <p>As noted in the above synopsis, series creator Vince Gilligan is at the helm as writer and director, while co-lead actor Aaron Paul stars as everyone\u2019s favorite long-suffering meth dealer, Jesse Pinkman.</p> <p>Aside from Paul, the only other series regular we know for sure is returning is actor Charles Baker, the only cast member other than Paul as of yet listed on the film\u2019s official <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9243946/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast\">IMDB page</a>. Baker, who plays Jesse\u2019s loyal but skeezy friend Skinny Pete, is front and center for the teaser trailer, which sees him refusing to help law enforcement agents in their search for Jesse.</p> <h2><strong>Where </strong><em><strong>might</strong></em><strong> El Camino pick up and who else </strong><em><strong>might</strong></em><strong> return?</strong></h2> <p>When last we saw Jesse Pinkman, he had just been freed from months of captivity and forced labor at the hands of a white supremacist drug syndicate by Walter White. After refusing to take vengeance on his former teacher/business partner/surrogate father/mortal enemy, Jesse drives off into the night in the titular El Camino, and the final shot we see of him has him first laughing, then screaming into the void as he hurtles down an empty stretch of road on his way to parts unknown.</p> <p>Per the synopsis and teaser, El Camino picks up from there (though we\u2019ll no doubt be treated to one of Breaking Bad\u2019s signature opening time jumps), with authorities searching for Jesse following the death of Walter White. As Skinny Pete notes, Jesse\u2019s story, like Heisenberg\u2019s at the start of Breaking Bad\u2019s final season, has been made public making it likely that criminal elements \u2013 including possibly the cartels \u2013 are also on the hunt for him, hoping either to make use of his meth cooking skills or to extract vengeance for any of his numerous criminal trespasses over the years.</p> <p>Given this state of affairs, we can expect El Camino to take the shape of a road/chase movie, (the film\u2019s title and poster suggesting as much) in which Jesse attempts to outrun his demons both mortal and psychological. Jesse\u2019s story has, from the beginning, been one of existential crisis, and there\u2019s few better frameworks for exploring existential crises than a road movie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8373bfedd8128b7e4be7c11f2ea9cb27af78952\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8373bfedd8128b7e4be7c11f2ea9cb27af78952/0_142_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The specter of Walter White is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Screenplayed/status/1165647842872090624?s=20\">certain to haunt</a> the movie, though whether or not the character actually makes an appearance is anyone\u2019s guess (Bryan Cranston has been conspicuously silent about any involvement he may have with the film). Walt, of course, was killed at the conclusion of Breaking Bad, so obviously he won\u2019t be showing up alive, but there\u2019s no reason to think he might not appear in a flashback, dream sequence or, given the role of narcotics in the overarching story, a possible hallucination. The same is true of other characters whose demise Jesse was witness to or had a hand in, including former lovers Jane (Krysten Ritter) and Andrea (Emily Rios), as well as former partners-turned-adversaries (and vice versa) Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) and Hank Schrader (Dean Norris).</p> <p>As for the characters left standing at the end of the series\u2019 initial run, we can probably expect raspy voice slacker Badger (Matt L Jones) to show up, being that he and Skinny Pete are usually joined at the hip. Given the authorities are cross-examining Skinny Pete in the teaser, they seem to know who was involved in Walt and Jesse\u2019s operation, which could mean we get appearances from fan favorites Huell (Lavell Crawford) and Kuby (Bill Burr).</p> <p>As for Breaking Bad\u2019s other breakout star, Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) who is, in the world of the story, very much alive, hiding out under an assumed name and managing a Cinnabon, it\u2019s highly unlikely he\u2019d show up, being that he\u2019s currently the star of his own series, the prequel-spinoff Better Call Saul, which is set for a fifth season sometime next year. Gilligan has said he intends to have Walt and Jesse eventually turn up on that show, but even though the majority of it takes place in the past, the show has given viewers the occasional glimpse of Goodman\u2019s present situation, so you would assume Gilligan would avoid complicating or spoiling it\u2019s long-term resolution by inserting the character in El Camino.</p> <p>One final clue (which may not actually be a clue) is the original working title under which the film was shot: Greenbrier. Although placeholder titles are standard for the high-profile productions, this one might hold a deeper meaning. Greenbrier is a common term for Smilax, a type of climbing flower plant named in reference to Greek myth about a young man who falls in love with a nymph and gets turned into a plant. The character of Jesse once stated his desire to move to New Zealand and become a bush pilot, and in the days following the series finale, both Paul and Gilligan <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/breaking-bads-aaron-paul-jesse-pinkman-is-now-a-carpenter-living-in-alaska-9207431.html\">stated</a> that they saw Jesse living a peaceful life somewhere remote, like Alaska.

If the poster is anything to go by, the movie looks to share that particular visual aesthetic.)</p> <h2><strong>Can El Camino match the hype?</strong></h2> <p>For all the above conjecture and guesswork, the only question that really matters is whether or not El Camino can live up to the standard set by the original series, one of the most riveting and intoxicating of the modern era.

      "bodyText": "At the end of last week, Netflix surprised Breaking Bad fans by dropping a load of information and material for the forthcoming sequel film, newly titled El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, including premiere date, teaser trailer, poster and official synopsis.

The prime minister claimed there would be \u201cample time\u201d to debate Brexit, as he wrote to MPs on Wednesday, saying he had spoken to the Queen and asked her to suspend parliament from \u201cthe second sitting week in September\u201d. The Queen approved the order later on Wednesday. MPs will then not return to Westminster until 14 October, when he said there would be a new Queen\u2019s speech, setting out what he called a \u201cbold and ambitious domestic legislative agenda for the renewal of our country after Brexit\u201d. The effect of the decision will be to curtail the time MPs have to introduce legislation or other measures aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and increase the pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to table a vote of no confidence next week. If Johnson lost that vote, there would then be a 14-day period in which the Labour party leader, or an alternative candidate, could seek to assemble a majority. If no new government emerges, a general election would have to be held. But government sources insist Johnson is determined not to go to the polls before Britain is due to leave the EU. \u201cWe have been very clear that if there\u2019s a no-confidence vote, he won\u2019t resign.

Asked if he was denying opposition MPs the time to stop a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister told Sky News: \u201cNo, that is completely untrue. We are bringing forward a new legislative programme on crime, hospitals, making sure we have the education funding we need.\u201d In the letter to colleagues, Johnson said MPs would be able to debate his approach to the EU negotiations before the European council on 17 October, at which any new deal would have to be agreed by the EU27 \u2013 and to vote on it afterwards. \u201cParliament will have the opportunity to debate the government\u2019s overall programme, and approach to Brexit, in the run-up to EU council, and then vote on this on 21 and 22 October, once we know the outcome of the council. \u201cShould I succeed in agreeing a deal with the EU, parliament will then have the opportunity to pass the bill required for ratification of the deal ahead of 31 October,\u201d he said. In practice, given MPs do not sit on most Fridays, they are only likely to lose between four and six sitting days in parliament, depending on which day parliament is prorogued on the second week of September. MPs would have been due to hold conference recess anyway, from 12 September until 7 October. Leaked emails revealed at the weekend that Johnson had sought legal advice about proroguing parliament for five weeks from early September, when MPs are already expected to break briefly for party conferences. On Wednesday morning the Conservative chairman, James Cleverly, confirmed the move on Twitter, saying that planning to hold a Queen\u2019s speech was something that \u201call new governments do\u201d. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, called the move \u201can utterly scandalous affront to our democracy. We cannot let this happen.\u201d A meeting of opposition MPs, convened by Jeremy Corbyn, agreed on Tuesday to let legislative efforts take priority over a confidence vote in the new government as a mechanism to stop no deal \u2013 a priority that could be changed given the curtailing of the parliamentary timetable. The proposed new timetable would leave MPs with a far narrower window to pass anti-no deal legislation, cutting it short by two weeks, with new dates likely to be: MPs returning on 3 September. A new spending review on 4 September. Parliament prorogued before party conferences on 12 September. Parliament returns for Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October. The EU council meets on 17 October, potentially to agree any new Brexit deal. The UK would be due to leave the EU on 31 October. Rumours swirled in Westminster on Tuesday that plans were afoot to stymie MPs\u2019 efforts to stop no deal after it was revealed that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, would hold a fast-tracked spending review on the day after MPs return to parliament next week, promising a cash boost for schools, hospitals and policing. The swift timing of the review came as the first major speech by the chancellor was abruptly cancelled by the Treasury with less than 24 hours\u2019 notice. A Treasury spokesman said the speech had been cancelled because the one-year spending review \u2013 called a spending round \u2013 which had been expected to take place later this autumn, was being fast-tracked. Javid, writing in the Daily Telegraph, suggested he would not break Philip Hammond\u2019s strict fiscal rules, saying the government could \u201cafford to spend more on the people\u2019s priorities \u2013 without breaking the rules around what the government should spend \u2013 and we\u2019ll do that in a few key areas like schools, hospitals and police\u201d. The chancellor said his economic priorities were health, education and policing, suggesting that other key areas including housing might miss out on major investment. He said: \u201cHealth and education aren\u2019t just the names of departments \u2013 they\u2019re lifelines of opportunity, just as they were for me. The teachers who persuaded me that I had what it takes to study economics, and put me on the path to becoming chancellor of the exchequer. \u201cThe police officers who kept us safe when the street I grew up on became a centre for drug dealers.

Whitehall sources suggested there was considerable concern MPs could trigger a vote of no confidence in the government and an early general election, which could lead to departments being left in the dark about spending plans, with budgets running out in 2020. \u201cWe want people to be able to plan and there is a reason it is in early September because of the risks when MPs return to the house that week,\u201d one source said.

His lawyer, Shafee Abdullah, had unsuccessfully attempted to delay the start of the 1MDB trial to September, claiming his team needed more time to prepare after the prosecution handed him thousands of pages of documents, but last week the judge ruled it would go ahead. Six witnesses were due to be called by the prosecution on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>It will be the second trial the former prime minister has faced, and it is likely he will face a third. On Tuesday, proceedings wrapped up for Najib\u2019s first trial, which related to SRC International, a subsidiary fund of 1MDB.

There are 1MDB investigations taking place in 12 countries, and in the US, the justice department recently charged two former Goldman Sachs bankers with conspiring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/01/malaysia-1mdb-scandal-us-justice-department-charges-former-goldman-bankers\">launder billions of dollars</a> embezzled from Malaysia\u2019s state development fund.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Malaysia\u2019s former prime minister Najib Razak abused his power to steal billions from the state to \u201cenrich himself\u201d and then conducted an elaborate charade to cover his tracks, prosecutors in Kuala Lumpur have said. The first day of the trial of Najib over his alleged involvement in a vast corruption scandal opened on Wednesday, after months of delays, with a blistering summary of his alleged crimes by the chief prosecutor, Gopal Sri Ram. The 1MDB affair, which was exposed in 2015, has been described as the \u201cbiggest kleptocracy scandal in the world\u201d. More than $4.5bn of state money was embezzled from a Malaysian government fund, known as 1MDB, and spent lavishly in Malaysia and around the world on everything from Manhattan real estate and diamonds to Pablo Picasso paintings and financing Hollywood films. Najib, who served as Malaysia\u2019s prime minister for nine years before being toppled from power last year, faces 25 charges, including abuse of power. He is accused of transferring 2.3bn ringgit (\u00a3440m) out of 1MDB \u2013 almost a quarter of its funds. Najib denies all the charges and says he was misled by others involved in the running of the fund. In his opening speech, Gopal said Najib was \u201cpivotal\u201d in the plundering of the 1MDB fund and then \u201cinterfered with the course of investigation of this case \u2026 He took active steps to effect a cover-up of his criminal acts\u201d. Gopal said the relationship between the Malaysian businessman Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low, and Najib would be central to the prosecution\u2019s case. Low was brought in as an informal consultant to 1MDB and became notorious for his ostentatious lifestyle, including buying swathes of Manhattan real estate and partying with celebrities, which it is alleged was funded by stolen 1MDB money. Low\u2019s location is unknown. He has denied all the charges. Gopal said Najib had \u201cmade it clear to 1MDB\u2019s officers, its board and others that Jho Low was his alter ego. In truth, Jho Low was the accused\u2019s mirror image \u2026 they acted as one\u201d. Najib and Low had produced \u201csham documents\u201d to \u201ccover his tracks\u201d, including letters and four cheques totalling $25m to pretend the stolen 1MDB money was a donation from an Arab prince, Gopal said. \u201cBut these cheques were never meant to be cashed and were never cashed,\u201d said Gopal. Najib is the first former Malaysian prime minister to be charged with crimes carried out while in office. His lawyer, Shafee Abdullah, had unsuccessfully attempted to delay the start of the 1MDB trial to September, claiming his team needed more time to prepare after the prosecution handed him thousands of pages of documents, but last week the judge ruled it would go ahead. Six witnesses were due to be called by the prosecution on Wednesday. It will be the second trial the former prime minister has faced, and it is likely he will face a third. On Tuesday, proceedings wrapped up for Najib\u2019s first trial, which related to SRC International, a subsidiary fund of 1MDB. Najib is alleged to have siphoned an estimated $10m from SRC into his personal bank accounts, charges he also denies. During the SRC trial, the profligate spending habits of Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, were described in court, including Najib spending $800,000 in a single day at a luxury Swiss jeweller in Italy. However, the 1MDB trial is considered the most significant, both for Malaysia and internationally. There are 1MDB investigations taking place in 12 countries, and in the US, the justice department recently charged two former Goldman Sachs bankers with conspiring to launder billions of dollars embezzled from Malaysia\u2019s state development fund.",

      "body": "<p>European sources have warned that Boris Johnson\u2019s move to suspend parliament for five weeks has increased the chances of a no-deal Brexit, while a leading MEP said: \u201cTaking back control has never looked so sinister.\u201d</p> \n<p>The plan to suspend parliament for five weeks, which would drastically reduce MPs\u2019 ability to influence changes to the withdrawal agreement or seek a delay, is seen in Brussels as a move to overpower rebels and force through Johnson\u2019s Brexit agenda.</p> \n<p>The European parliament\u2019s coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt, said the move was unlikely to deliver a stable future relationship. \u201c\u2018Taking back control\u2019 has never looked so sinister,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a fellow parliamentarian, my solidarity with those fighting for their voices to be heard. Suppressing debate on profound choices is unlikely to help deliver a stable future EU-UK relationship.\u201d</p> \n<p>EU officials said it heightened the chances of a no-deal outcome, as parliament could refuse to back a compromise presented to MPs, just days before the 31 October deadline.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b146305d-32c1-4dc9-9f4d-b60ce025264f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nathalie Loiseau, a former Europe minister, who is a close ally of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the move showed there was a \u201cdisease\u201d in British democracy.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe could see a Brexit without an agreement,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NathalieLoiseau/status/1166656831802023937\">the MEP wrote on Twitter</a>. \u201cIt is, moreover, a Brexit without debate that is looming.

      "bodyText": "European sources have warned that Boris Johnson\u2019s move to suspend parliament for five weeks has increased the chances of a no-deal Brexit, while a leading MEP said: \u201cTaking back control has never looked so sinister.\u201d The plan to suspend parliament for five weeks, which would drastically reduce MPs\u2019 ability to influence changes to the withdrawal agreement or seek a delay, is seen in Brussels as a move to overpower rebels and force through Johnson\u2019s Brexit agenda. The European parliament\u2019s coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt, said the move was unlikely to deliver a stable future relationship. \u201c\u2018Taking back control\u2019 has never looked so sinister,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a fellow parliamentarian, my solidarity with those fighting for their voices to be heard. Suppressing debate on profound choices is unlikely to help deliver a stable future EU-UK relationship.\u201d EU officials said it heightened the chances of a no-deal outcome, as parliament could refuse to back a compromise presented to MPs, just days before the 31 October deadline. Nathalie Loiseau, a former Europe minister, who is a close ally of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the move showed there was a \u201cdisease\u201d in British democracy. \u201cWe could see a Brexit without an agreement,\u201d the MEP wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt is, moreover, a Brexit without debate that is looming. From what disease is British democracy suffering from that there is a fear of debate before taking one of the most important decisions in its history?\u201d Norbert R\u04e7ttgen, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German Bundestag, sounded incredulous about the move. He tweeted: The request to the Queen was made as Johnson\u2019s Brexit envoy met senior EU officials in Brussels. David Frost, the prime minister\u2019s EU adviser, met officials working for Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, as well as Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s chief of staff, Clara Mart\u00ednez Alberola. Frost, a former Foreign Office diplomat who went on to lead the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, replaced Olly Robbins when Johnson took office in July. Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the EU council legal service, told the Guardian that the move to suspend parliament had convinced him that Johnson \u201cis determined to go for no-deal\u201d. The UK was in \u201ca really deep political and probably a deep constitutional crisis\u201d, but there was nothing the EU could do, he added. An EU diplomat said it was really hard to say what Johnson\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d was, adding that he was pessimistic about a compromise in talks. \u201cWe have no idea what his aim is apart from staying prime minister. This is his ultimate aim and all other things are being subjected to this aim.\u201d Before the meeting, Johnson saw EU leaders in Berlin, Paris and the G7 summit in Biarritz \u2013 a series of meetings that have injected a new dynamic into talks, according to EU officials. But the move to suspend parliament is now seen as heightening the risk of no deal. It has also been pointed out that it does buy Johnson more time to strike a deal, if there are fewer parliamentary sessions. EU diplomats remain sceptical about whether the prime minister can find alternatives to the Irish backstop \u2013 the main stumbling block \u2013 that can win over his party. Frost was not expected to put fresh ideas on the table, while the EU is stressing that proposals need to be offered sooner rather than later. Following the meeting between Frost and EU officials, a UK government spokesperson said the UK and EU had agreed to \u201cintensify discussions as of next week\u201d. When asked about Johnson\u2019s declaration that a \u201cblistering timetable\u201d for negotiations existed, a European commission spokesperson said: \u201cI am not aware of any 30 days deadline. Of course, for us, the earlier the better, because our working assumption is that Brexit should occur on 31 October and that should happen with a deal and that is our preferred scenario and the scenario we are working to. So for that to happen, the earlier we see workable proposals, the better.\u201d The spokesperson said Juncker and Johnson had agreed to \u201ccontinue the dialogue\u201d during a phone call between the two leaders on Tuesday evening. The EU has maintained its readiness to replace the backstop, an insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Under the backstop, agreed between the EU and Theresa May, Northern Ireland would continue to follow many EU single market rules, while the UK would remain part of an EU single customs territory.The backstop would kick in automatically if the two sides failed to find an alternative and would apply until new arrangements could be agreed. Dublin remains sceptical about alternatives that have been circulating. \u201cI think we need to be honest here that the alternative arrangements that have been discussed to date do not do the same job as the backstop, not even close,\u201d said Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, speaking after a meeting with his Czech counterpart on Tuesday evening. \u201cSo let\u2019s not pretend that solutions exist when they might not.\u201d In his call with Johnson, Juncker said the EU\u2019s support for Ireland was \u201csteadfast\u201d and that the bloc would \u201ccontinue to be very attentive to Ireland\u2019s interests\u201d. The UK government has said it is \u201cworking at pace to find a wide range of flexible and creative solutions to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland\u201d.",

If the government wants a new Queen\u2019s speech it could bring one forward on the usual week to two-week timetable for prorogation.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the current Brexit context, anything longer than this is clearly designed to help the government evade parliamentary scrutiny.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8155cfc9-4f92-4da0-8485-66257baf0e4f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Prorogation is the official term that marks the end of a parliamentary session. After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen\u2019s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills that have been passed during that session and summarises what has been achieved.</p>\n    <p>It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Parliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen\u2019s speech at the formal state opening of parliament.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meg Russell, a senior fellow of the UK in a Changing Europe initiative and the director of the constitution unit at University College of London, said: \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing, frankly, is hiding from parliamentary scrutiny: denying MPs the opportunity to question him and to hold him to account, and potentially denying them the opportunity to express no confidence in him.\u201d</p> \n<p>She continued: \u201cHe\u2019s daring MPs to vote him out of office.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf our constitution has one overriding principle, it\u2019s parliamentary sovereignty: the government only is the government because it has the support of parliament.</p> \n<p>\u201cBoris Johnson was prime minister for not much more than 24 hours when parliament broke for the summer recess. He has faced no parliamentary scrutiny for the entire period since then.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking at an unprecedentedly long prorogation, at a time when we are in the middle of the biggest political crisis since the second world war, and the prime minister has only been in office five minutes.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to prorogue parliament for five weeks is the longest suspension of the British legislature since 1945 and appears designed to evade scrutiny of his plans for Brexit or any new deal with the EU, constitutional experts have said. Ruth Fox, the director of the highly respected Hansard Society, a leading source of independent research and advice on parliamentary affairs, said it was an \u201caffront to parliamentary democracy\u201d. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has said the move was an \u201coffence against the democratic process\u201d designed to stop MPs debating Brexit. Lawyers said the unprecedented length of the suspension of parliament would prompt immediate legal challenge. \u201cExpect litigation \u2013 starting in Scotland,\u201d said Ros Kellaway, the head of Brexit and EU law at Eversheds Sutherland, in London. The prorogation could also have consequences for Northern Ireland, where a no-deal Brexit could increase the threat of direct rule from Westminster. The lengthy gap between the end of the last scheduled parliamentary session, on 9 September, and the next sitting, on 14 October, compares with a \u201cthree to seven day gap\u201d in the last decade, said Fox. \u201cThe decision to prorogue parliament is not unconstitutional but the length of it is unprecedented in recent times. If the government wants a new Queen\u2019s speech it could bring one forward on the usual week to two-week timetable for prorogation. \u201cIn the current Brexit context, anything longer than this is clearly designed to help the government evade parliamentary scrutiny.\u201d Meg Russell, a senior fellow of the UK in a Changing Europe initiative and the director of the constitution unit at University College of London, said: \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing, frankly, is hiding from parliamentary scrutiny: denying MPs the opportunity to question him and to hold him to account, and potentially denying them the opportunity to express no confidence in him.\u201d She continued: \u201cHe\u2019s daring MPs to vote him out of office. \u201cIf our constitution has one overriding principle, it\u2019s parliamentary sovereignty: the government only is the government because it has the support of parliament. \u201cBoris Johnson was prime minister for not much more than 24 hours when parliament broke for the summer recess. He has faced no parliamentary scrutiny for the entire period since then. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at an unprecedentedly long prorogation, at a time when we are in the middle of the biggest political crisis since the second world war, and the prime minister has only been in office five minutes. It\u2019s putting the Queen in a very difficult situation.\u201d Hansard said the last time there was a prorogation for longer than two weeks was in 2014, when parliament was suspended for 14 days. But this included time off for EU parliamentary elections and Whitsun recess. Johnson\u2019s supporters argue the five-week gap is needed to develop new legislation. Parliament is already in the longest-running session since 1945 because of the logjam created by Brexit. However, Hansard says suspending parliament will deny democratic scrutiny as ministers will not have to account to parliament and select committees, which have been vital in investigating the consequences of Brexit. \u201cOn their return in October MPs will have very little time to scrutinise any new deal with the EU, if there is one, or little time to scrutinise the remaining statutory instruments that the government may need for a no-deal Brexit,\u201d said Fox. Bercow, who has said he will \u201cfight with every breath in my body\u201d to stop Johnson from proroguing parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit without the consent of MPs, said: \u201cHowever it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country. \u201cShutting down parliament would be an offence against the democratic process and the rights of parliamentarians as the people\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Catherine Haddon, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, said the move did \u201cseem like a very obvious move to try and cut down the time available to anti-no deal MPs to be able to do something about it\u201d.",

The Connecticut-based company has been blamed for fueling the opioids crisis, which has cost the lives of more than 400,000 people across the US in the last 20 years and still kills 130 through overdoses every day, according to government figures. Settlement talks that have been going on for over a year appear to be approaching a climax and will be further accelerated by a landmark ruling in Oklahoma on Monday, where another pharmaceutical giant, Johnson &amp; Johnson, lost at trial in a civil case brought by the state and was ordered to pay out $572m. Purdue previously settled in that case, as did another drug company, before it reached the trial stage.

Purdue had been a defendant in that case but settled in May for $270m, as did another defendant, Teva Pharmaceuticals. Johnson &amp; Johnson was accused of using a \u201ccunning scheme\u201d to market its opioids. Monday\u2019s verdict, with damning opinions issued by the judge, immediately signaled wide-ranging consequences for the other opioid makers, distributors and pharmacy chains facing thousands of lawsuits across the country. The company has denied wrongdoing and said it will appeal. But Purdue and other companies, as well as a group of eight members of the Sackler family that wholly owns Purdue, still face civil court cases brought by Massachusetts, New York and numerous other states, and a multi-district case playing out in federal court in Cleveland that brings together suits by almost 2,000 US cities and counties. The first trials in that giant case in Cleveland are due to start in October and lawyers for Purdue, its owners and other companies have been in talks for months to try to hammer out a settlement. A spokeswoman for Purdue Pharma declined to comment on the details of settlement talks but sent a statement to the Guardian. It read: \u201cWhile Purdue Pharma is prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation, the company has made clear that it sees little good coming from years of wasteful litigation and appeals. The people and communities affected by the opioid crisis need help now.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cPurdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome.\u201d Purdue Pharma and leading Sackler family members Richard, Beverly, Theresa, Kathe, Ilene, Mortimer Jr, David and Jonathan Sackler have vigorously denied any wrongdoing in relation to the opioids crisis. David Sackler led last week\u2019s negotiations on behalf of the family, according to NBC. A request for comment has been submitted to representatives of the Sacklers. The core members of the family and their immediate relatives are understood to be collectively worth at least $13bn and have long been at odds with other, less wealthy parts of the family who have not been involved with Purdue Pharma and its lucrative OxyContin narcotic, over blame for the US opioids crisis. The Sacklers\u2019 part of any settlement deal, on behalf of the eight members of the family being sued, would probably be obtained by selling off Mundipharma, according to the NBC report, a separate global pharmaceutical company they own, which has itself come under fire for efforts to expand opioids sales in other countries. Purdue is being sued by states, counties and cities coast to coast. \u201cOur mission here has always been clear \u2013 make Purdue Pharma and the other manufacturers and distributors pay for what they did to Pennsylvania and its people, and put the Sackler family out of the opioid business for good,\u201d said Jacklin Rhoads, spokeswoman for Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general, Josh Shapiro, who has staffers at the Cleveland negotiations.

I suspect that some viewers believe stories set in the past take on an instant sheen of respectability just because they\u2019re old, when anyone who has seen Horrible Histories knows that the past was awful, and anyone who has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/aug/28/caligulassexandexcessisbi\" title=\"\">Caligula</a> knows that it was rude. This certainly seemed to be the case for two members of the audience when I went to see The Favourite at the cinema.

The nipple has long been freed for men, but there does seem to be a lot more full-frontal, as well as full \u201cbackal\u201d, on screen than there was, at least when it comes to male, er, parts. Chris Pine\u2019s Scottish warrior made the internet blush when he emerged from a swim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/23/chris-pine-penis-nudity-outlaw-king\" title=\"\">without a stitch on</a>; Mr Darcy would not have dared.</p> <p>In fact, most streaming and cable television would scoff at the Sanditon fuss. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/03/is-euphoria-the-most-shocking-teen-show-ever\" title=\"\">Euphoria</a>, HBO\u2019s excellent, uproarious teen drama, features a literal lesson in dick pics, which does not shy away from showing the topic under consideration.

It is not necessarily more male nudity, but more of an equal-opportunities approach to it in general. If we\u2019re going to have naked bodies, then let\u2019s see the lot. It may move towards redressing an age-old imbalance; I\u2019ve seen enough women with no clothes on for it to be par for the course in scenes that have not in any way called for nudity, sometimes in scenes in which the female character is called simply \u201cmurder victim\u201d.</p> <p>However, watching the first episode of Game of Thrones\u2019s final season made me realise that something had shifted. They threw in a moment of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/11/sexposition-story-tv-drama\" title=\"\">sexposition</a>\u201d for which it had been known in the early days \u2013 a scene in brothel, explaining a crucial part of the plot while naked women bounce away merrily \u2013 and it was jarring and suddenly old-fashioned. I don\u2019t think I have become more prudish in the years since Game of Thrones began, but perhaps I have grown to expect that it is not just women who will get their kits off on screen. If more bums on beaches means fewer tits on slabs, then fine: get them all out. Or else simply stop writing scenes for men near water.</p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is a freelance writer</p>",

In 1995, he had Colin Firth fans panting over Firth\u2019s sodden emergence from a lake. I went back and watched this scene, in the name of research, and it is considerably more chaste than history has remembered it to be. His Mr Darcy essentially takes off his jacket, which is more of a practical measure against drowning than it is a sign of his rampant virility. It\u2019s as racy, these days, as a flash of the ankle. Despite Davies\u2019 fine work, there may be an unfair expectation of propriety placed on period dramas. I suspect that some viewers believe stories set in the past take on an instant sheen of respectability just because they\u2019re old, when anyone who has seen Horrible Histories knows that the past was awful, and anyone who has seen Caligula knows that it was rude. This certainly seemed to be the case for two members of the audience when I went to see The Favourite at the cinema. The couple appeared to have been expecting Cranford, and ensured that everyone else knew how horrified they were by the term \u201ccunt-struck\u201d by tutting incredibly loudly. Who knows what they would have made of Netflix\u2019s Outlaw King. The nipple has long been freed for men, but there does seem to be a lot more full-frontal, as well as full \u201cbackal\u201d, on screen than there was, at least when it comes to male, er, parts. Chris Pine\u2019s Scottish warrior made the internet blush when he emerged from a swim without a stitch on; Mr Darcy would not have dared. In fact, most streaming and cable television would scoff at the Sanditon fuss. Euphoria, HBO\u2019s excellent, uproarious teen drama, features a literal lesson in dick pics, which does not shy away from showing the topic under consideration. It also features nude men and women, cis and trans, all different body types, and, for its otherwise bleak worldview, it has a warmly open and democratic approach to many kinds of human bodies. I wonder if Reid is right, and nudity is what we want now. It is not necessarily more male nudity, but more of an equal-opportunities approach to it in general. If we\u2019re going to have naked bodies, then let\u2019s see the lot. It may move towards redressing an age-old imbalance; I\u2019ve seen enough women with no clothes on for it to be par for the course in scenes that have not in any way called for nudity, sometimes in scenes in which the female character is called simply \u201cmurder victim\u201d. However, watching the first episode of Game of Thrones\u2019s final season made me realise that something had shifted. They threw in a moment of the \u201csexposition\u201d for which it had been known in the early days \u2013 a scene in brothel, explaining a crucial part of the plot while naked women bounce away merrily \u2013 and it was jarring and suddenly old-fashioned. I don\u2019t think I have become more prudish in the years since Game of Thrones began, but perhaps I have grown to expect that it is not just women who will get their kits off on screen. If more bums on beaches means fewer tits on slabs, then fine: get them all out. Or else simply stop writing scenes for men near water. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is a freelance writer",

      "bodyText": "A former undercover police officer who infiltrated environmental groups for seven years is under investigation by police for deceiving women into sexual relationships and allegedly leaking secrets. Police chiefs are conducting a criminal investigation into Mark Kennedy, whose covert deployment was exposed principally by one of the women he had deceived. The investigation is examining whether Kennedy conducted \u201cinappropriate sexual relationships\u201d and whether he broke the 1989 Official Secrets Act, according to police. Police chiefs have claimed that undercover officers were not allowed to form sexual relationships with the campaigners they were deployed to spy on. At times, however, police chiefs have displayed a more ambivalent stance and argued that such relationships could be permitted. Kennedy adopted a fake identity for seven years and pretended to be an environmental and leftwing campaigner in a series of groups such as Climate Camp. During his covert deployment, Kennedy formed a number of intimate relationships with women without telling them that he was a police spy. The longest relationship lasted six years. Police have admitted that Kennedy deceived four of these women, who were environmental activists, into forming \u201cabusive and manipulative\u201d long-term relationships. The Met subsequently paid them compensation. Police have also admitted that Kennedy\u2019s managers knew he was deceiving one of the activists, Kate Wilson, into a long-term sexual relationship and allowed it to continue. Kennedy was one of about 140 undercover police officers in two covert units who spied on more than 1,000 political groups in long-term deployments, usually lasting about five years, since 1968. After he was unmasked in 2010, Kennedy hired celebrity publicist Max Clifford to sell his story to the media and arrange a series of interviews with journalists. He had by then left the Metropolitan police. The investigation into Kennedy, codenamed Operation Montrose, started in January 2015 at the request of Scotland Yard. Investigators have interviewed an unidentified individual under caution and six others as witnesses. The investigation is led by the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC), and conducted by Metropolitan police officers, as part of a wider internal inquiry into Kennedy\u2019s former unit. Undercover officers in the National Public Order Intelligence Unit infiltrated political movements between 1999 and 2011, when it was shut down following revelations about Kennedy and some of its other members. So far, 20 undercover officers who worked for the two units are known to have had intimate sexual relationships, some of them lasting years, while using fake identities between the mid-1970s and 2010.

For prorogation to last more than a month is unprecedented in recent times. For example, since the 1980s prorogation has typically lasted less than a week.</p> \n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/chancellor-sajid-javid-fast-tracked-spending-review-fuels-talk-of-early-election\">the five-week suspension</a> does include a three-week period that would typically be recess anyway, three weeks during which the Liberal Democrat, Labour and Conservative party conferences are held.</p> \n<p>The length of the prorogation will clearly have the effect of narrowing rebel MPs\u2019 options \u2013 they have two weeks fewer in parliament to pass any anti-no-deal legislation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"714c33c0-427a-4502-a3cc-9014d13af240\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xAfmVOq5hu8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Why does Boris Johnson say he is doing this?</h2> \n<p>Johnson has rejected claims his decision is designed to block MPs from considering ways to thwart his Brexit plans after he was accused of mounting a \u201ccoup\u201d against parliament. No 10 said there would be \u201cample time\u201d for MPs to debate Brexit either side of the EU summit on 17 October.</p> \n<p>He says the move will allow him to \u201cbring forward an ambitious new legislative programme for MPs\u2019 approval\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Can MPs vote against prorogation?</h2> \n<p>No. Parliament is due to go on a three-week conference recess anyway in the second week of September and there had been suggestions MPs would vote against holding this recess, or any attempt to extend it. However, proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in this way.</p> \n<h2>How does the privy council come into this?</h2> \n<p>The request to the Queen and the proposed timetable was made at a privy council meeting at Balmoral by a small number of senior ministers who attend the meetings.</p> \n<p>There has been some confusion because technically senior opposition MPs are members of the privy council, including Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader. But these MPs do not go to actual meetings, that is the preserve of a select number of senior ministers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is the lord president of the council.</p> \n<h2>Could the Queen have refused the privy council\u2019s request?</h2> \n<p>Technically, yes under the royal prerogative. But in reality it would have been extremely difficult for her to do so. Corbyn has written to her saying that \u201cthere was a danger that the royal prerogative is being set directly against the wishes of a majority of the House of Commons\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"94c926a2-cde0-4c99-a852-cbfafac69ae9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jy1w05NrzDw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>How will this affect plans to stop no deal?</h2> \n<p>Less than 24 hours after Corbyn and other opposition MPs came to an agreement that they would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/27/brexit-jeremy-corbyn-prioritise-legislation-stop-no-deal-meeting-opposition-parties-labour\">use legislative efforts to stop no deal</a>, rather than the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of an immediate no-confidence vote, it looks like the window for potential legislation has become far narrower.</p> \n<p>It makes the prospect of a snap no-confidence vote far more likely and remainer MPs will need to weigh up that option again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/jeremy-corbyn-urges-opposition-leaders-and-tory-rebels-to-help-oust-pm\">Corbyn has offered to lead a caretaker government to negotiate an extension to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/jeremy-corbyn-urges-opposition-leaders-and-tory-rebels-to-help-oust-pm\">article 50</a> and then call a general election \u2013 an offer that is highly unpalatable to most Conservative MPs.</p> \n<p>The Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, who opposes a no-deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, said he would consult with likeminded MPs over the next few days before parliament\u2019s return next week.</p> \n<p>Grieve said a no-confidence vote was now more likely. \u201cIf it is impossible to prevent prorogation then I think it is going to be very difficult for people like myself to keep confidence in the government and I could well see why the leader of the opposition would wish to table a motion for a vote of no confidence,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/brexit-flow-chart-zip/giv-3902DxZOigN1NsPI/\" data-alt=\"Timetable\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/brexit-flow-chart-zip/giv-3902DxZOigN1NsPI/\">Timetable</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Will there be legal action to stop prorogation?</h2> \n<p>There will certainly be an attempt.

Johnson has rejected claims his decision is designed to block MPs from considering ways to thwart his Brexit plans after he was accused of mounting a \u201ccoup\u201d against parliament. No 10 said there would be \u201cample time\u201d for MPs to debate Brexit either side of the EU summit on 17 October. He says the move will allow him to \u201cbring forward an ambitious new legislative programme for MPs\u2019 approval\u201d. Can MPs vote against prorogation? No. Parliament is due to go on a three-week conference recess anyway in the second week of September and there had been suggestions MPs would vote against holding this recess, or any attempt to extend it. However, proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in this way. How does the privy council come into this? The request to the Queen and the proposed timetable was made at a privy council meeting at Balmoral by a small number of senior ministers who attend the meetings. There has been some confusion because technically senior opposition MPs are members of the privy council, including Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader. But these MPs do not go to actual meetings, that is the preserve of a select number of senior ministers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is the lord president of the council. Could the Queen have refused the privy council\u2019s request? Technically, yes under the royal prerogative. But in reality it would have been extremely difficult for her to do so. Corbyn has written to her saying that \u201cthere was a danger that the royal prerogative is being set directly against the wishes of a majority of the House of Commons\u201d. How will this affect plans to stop no deal? Less than 24 hours after Corbyn and other opposition MPs came to an agreement that they would use legislative efforts to stop no deal, rather than the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of an immediate no-confidence vote, it looks like the window for potential legislation has become far narrower. It makes the prospect of a snap no-confidence vote far more likely and remainer MPs will need to weigh up that option again. Corbyn has offered to lead a caretaker government to negotiate an extension to article 50 and then call a general election \u2013 an offer that is highly unpalatable to most Conservative MPs. The Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, who opposes a no-deal Brexit, said he would consult with likeminded MPs over the next few days before parliament\u2019s return next week. Grieve said a no-confidence vote was now more likely. \u201cIf it is impossible to prevent prorogation then I think it is going to be very difficult for people like myself to keep confidence in the government and I could well see why the leader of the opposition would wish to table a motion for a vote of no confidence,\u201d he said. Will there be legal action to stop prorogation? There will certainly be an attempt. The campaigner Gina Miller revealed on Wednesday evening that her lawyers had made an urgent application to the high court for a judicial review of Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to prorogue parliament. The SNP MP Joanna Cherry has confirmed that she has spoken to her legal team about speeding up the planned action in the Scottish courts, which was due to be heard on 6 September. Labour\u2019s Ian Murray, another of the cross-party group of more than 70 MPs and peers behind the action, said they would consider seeking an interim interdict \u2013 similar to an injunction in England and Wales \u2013 in the court of session to block prorogation. Led by Jolyon Maugham QC\u2019s Good Law Project, the group had been seeking a ruling from the court of session to prevent the prime minister going to the Queen with a request for prorogation until all appeals were exhausted.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to prorogue parliament ahead of a Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October is intended to provoke parliamentarians into blocking a no-deal Brexit, or triggering a general election through a vote of no confidence. Both are feasible in the time available. The last time parliament stepped in to block no deal earlier in the year, the necessary legislation was passed in just three days. Johnson has deliberately left enough time for parliament to seize control again. That\u2019s because Johnson\u2019s real objective is to use Brexit to win a general election, rather than use a general election to secure Brexit. By forcing the hands of his opponents, he has defined the terrain for a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election. Expect him to run on \u201cBack Boris, Take Back Britain\u201d. He will say that the only way to definitely leave on 31 October is to give him a parliamentary majority to do so. The man of Eton, Oxford and the Telegraph will position himself as the leader of the people against the hated establishment and \u201cremainer elite\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The verdict on the composer Hector Berlioz when he died 150 years ago was decidedly mixed. Respected by some, dismissed by others, his music was loved by only a few. It would take the passing of many anniversaries for Berlioz\u2019s star to rise in his native France, although he became increasingly appreciated abroad, notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/21/from-the-classical-archive-1848-review-berlioz-his-mind-is-richly-stored-with-new-and-striking-ideas-\">here in the UK</a>. When his opera <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/26/les-troyens-royal-opera-house-review\">The Trojans</a> was finally premiered complete in Paris it was conducted by John Eliot Gardiner. But, amazingly, that was not until 2003.</p> <p>Berlioz had an acute musical ear and an extraordinary, teeming imagination. His music could be thrilling, but also unsettling, often indefinable. The French couldn\u2019t pin him down, so they explained him away: he was brash, opinionated, given to extravagant experiments and crazy projects. They caricatured him as a bushy-haired, wild-eyed necromancer presiding over vast orchestras with massive ranks of brass and percussion. But that was far from the whole story: size was never for size\u2019s sake. It was only part of a quest by Berlioz for something that would touch us most dramatically and profoundly \u2013 because music matters. \u201cMusic and love,\u201d he said, \u201care the wings of the soul.\u201d</p> <p>Berlioz lived his life at a high level of drama and controversy, documented with style and wit in his sparkling <a href=\"http://www.hberlioz.com/Writings/HBMindex.htm\">Memoirs</a>. He was also for many years the trenchant music critic of a leading newspaper, the <a href=\"http://www.hberlioz.com/feuilletons/debatsindex.htm\">Journal des D\u00e9bats</a>.

      "bodyText": "The verdict on the composer Hector Berlioz when he died 150 years ago was decidedly mixed. Respected by some, dismissed by others, his music was loved by only a few. It would take the passing of many anniversaries for Berlioz\u2019s star to rise in his native France, although he became increasingly appreciated abroad, notably here in the UK. When his opera The Trojans was finally premiered complete in Paris it was conducted by John Eliot Gardiner. But, amazingly, that was not until 2003. Berlioz had an acute musical ear and an extraordinary, teeming imagination. His music could be thrilling, but also unsettling, often indefinable. The French couldn\u2019t pin him down, so they explained him away: he was brash, opinionated, given to extravagant experiments and crazy projects. They caricatured him as a bushy-haired, wild-eyed necromancer presiding over vast orchestras with massive ranks of brass and percussion. But that was far from the whole story: size was never for size\u2019s sake. It was only part of a quest by Berlioz for something that would touch us most dramatically and profoundly \u2013 because music matters. \u201cMusic and love,\u201d he said, \u201care the wings of the soul.\u201d Berlioz lived his life at a high level of drama and controversy, documented with style and wit in his sparkling Memoirs. He was also for many years the trenchant music critic of a leading newspaper, the Journal des D\u00e9bats. He didn\u2019t suffer fools gladly, but he could also be disarmingly genial. Eliot Gardiner sums him up succinctly: \u201cHe would have been a wonderful person to share a bottle of wine with \u2013 though he\u2019d first have placed his two pistols on the table. He was never without them!\u201d Those pistols date from Berlioz\u2019s hot-headed youth, when he raced back to Paris from Rome intent on murder because his fiancee had broken off their engagement. Fortunately, he only got as far as Nice, where he abandoned the idea and instead composed an overture based on King Lear. Berlioz\u2019s passion for Shakespeare was fuelled by his infatuation for the Irish actor Harriet Smithson whom he saw play Juliet and Ophelia. Smithson became the elusive muse for his cinematic Symphonie Fantastique \u2013 a hallucinatory tale of unrequited love. She did eventually consent to marry him, but it didn\u2019t end well \u2026 In his professional life, Berlioz both railed against the establishment and aspired to join it, seeking election to the prestigious Institut de France.

He advised all composers to become good conductors, so that their works would not be mangled by incompetents \u2013 pointing the finger at Fran\u00e7ois Habeneck of the Paris Opera, his particular b\u00eate noire. Berlioz admired others of his contemporaries, however, and revered notable composers who had gone before, especially Gluck, Mozart, Weber and Beethoven. His landmark Treatise on Orchestration is full of examples from their works, as well as from his own. When we marked Berlioz\u2019s anniversary on BBC Radio 3 earlier this year, we wanted to celebrate his genius in writing for an orchestra. So we abandoned the usual broadcast schedule for a weekend and created a festival of live broadcast concerts across the UK with all the BBC Orchestras, Choirs, BBC Singers, and Ulster Orchestra.

She has yet to receive a court date.</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesman did not comment specifically on Johnston\u2019s circumstances but said: \u201cEvery effort is made to make sure people with hearing difficulties can serve on juries, and we are harnessing technology like hearing loops and computer-aided transcription services to improve accessibility even further.\u201d</p> <p>The MoJ says it is examining developments in potential new technology, including voice recognition software or simultaneous transcripts, that could provide technical assistance to those who are profoundly deaf.</p> <p>Anthony Jarvis, who was on the same jury panel at Blackfriars as Johnston, said: \u201cThe processes in court seemed like they were in no way negatively impacted by having a deaf juror and that the court handled it very well. The trial carried on as if having a deaf juror was standard procedure. It didn\u2019t feel like this was the first time.\u201d</p> <p>Johnston himself said that apart from a couple of small teething issues \u2013 his tablet ran out of battery charge at one point, and he also could not hear the announcements in the jury assembly area calling him to court \u2013 his time was entirely fulfilling.</p> <p>\u201cIt worked. It can be done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means that more people with hearing impairments can go on a jury. You\u2019ve got a bigger pool to select.\u201d</p> <p>His ultimate aim is that closed captioning is introduced to courts as a matter of course, and not only if someone on the jury self-reports as deaf. Eleven million people are hard of hearing in the UK, and Johnston said the option of reading subtitles could also help people for whom English is not their first language.</p> <p>He said that Blackfriars crown court had already sought his feedback with a view to increasing its accessibility, but he also recognised that some new technology aimed at producing automated and near-instant transcriptions from spoken word was potentially still too unrefined. \u201cIf it changes the dynamic of a deliberation, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2019. Based on records provided by the Ministry of Justice, an earlier version said Johnston was believed to have become the first profoundly deaf person to sit on a jury in a crown court in England and Wales. Two readers have since contacted the Guardian to say they or a family member have served as profoundly deaf jurors. The article has been updated accordingly.</p>",

A deaf woman from Essex recently said she had appealed against her disqualification to a judge, who ruled that she should be allowed to appear on a jury and provided with an interpreter in court and a speech-to-text converter in the jury room. She has yet to receive a court date. A Ministry of Justice spokesman did not comment specifically on Johnston\u2019s circumstances but said: \u201cEvery effort is made to make sure people with hearing difficulties can serve on juries, and we are harnessing technology like hearing loops and computer-aided transcription services to improve accessibility even further.\u201d The MoJ says it is examining developments in potential new technology, including voice recognition software or simultaneous transcripts, that could provide technical assistance to those who are profoundly deaf. Anthony Jarvis, who was on the same jury panel at Blackfriars as Johnston, said: \u201cThe processes in court seemed like they were in no way negatively impacted by having a deaf juror and that the court handled it very well. The trial carried on as if having a deaf juror was standard procedure. It didn\u2019t feel like this was the first time.\u201d Johnston himself said that apart from a couple of small teething issues \u2013 his tablet ran out of battery charge at one point, and he also could not hear the announcements in the jury assembly area calling him to court \u2013 his time was entirely fulfilling. \u201cIt worked. It can be done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means that more people with hearing impairments can go on a jury. You\u2019ve got a bigger pool to select.\u201d His ultimate aim is that closed captioning is introduced to courts as a matter of course, and not only if someone on the jury self-reports as deaf. Eleven million people are hard of hearing in the UK, and Johnston said the option of reading subtitles could also help people for whom English is not their first language. He said that Blackfriars crown court had already sought his feedback with a view to increasing its accessibility, but he also recognised that some new technology aimed at producing automated and near-instant transcriptions from spoken word was potentially still too unrefined. \u201cIf it changes the dynamic of a deliberation, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2019. Based on records provided by the Ministry of Justice, an earlier version said Johnston was believed to have become the first profoundly deaf person to sit on a jury in a crown court in England and Wales. Two readers have since contacted the Guardian to say they or a family member have served as profoundly deaf jurors. The article has been updated accordingly.",

Suddenly, there are a lot of verbs that can only be employed with the greatest of caution. The very best ghost stories get you to suspend your disbelief because whatever the nature of their manifestation the rationale for that ghost existing is entirely convincing: here are some of them.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/tonimorrison\">Beloved by Toni Morrison</a> (1987)</strong><br>This great testament to the horrors of slavery opens with a haunting. \u201c124 was spiteful. Full of a baby\u2019s venom. The women in the house knew it and so did the children.\u201d In the Nobel prize-winning author\u2019s most famous book, the ghost of a baby killed by her mother to save her from slavery is a malicious sprite but also a metaphor for the way in which the great evil of slavery haunts its victims after abolition, haunts the history of America and should haunt us all. To write it \u201cwas to pitch a tent in a cemetery inhabited by highly vocal ghosts\u201d, Morrison said, talking of the \u201cthe chaos of the needy dead\u201d. When Morrison\u2019s death was announced at the beginning of August, many commentators cited Beloved as one of the greatest novels of all time. If you haven\u2019t read it yet, what\u2019s wrong with you?</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/03/fiction.colmtoibin\">The Turn of the Screw by Henry James</a> (1898)</strong><br>No list of ghost stories could exclude this Victorian classic set in a remote country house. A governess has care of a young boy and girl, two orphans, who she comes to believe can see the ghosts of a man and woman maliciously haunting the house. One of the intriguing aspects of reading this unresolved story is that, seen through modern eyes, its ambiguities offer themselves up as metaphors for child neglect and sexual abuse within the home.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/28/man-tiger-eka-kurniawan-review-crime-novel-indonesian\">Man Tiger by Eka Kurniawan</a> (2015)</strong><br>Ghost stories from different nations provide a cultural barometer of sorts. Ghosts have a strong presence in Indonesian culture and the white tiger that inhabits this story is not only the phantom inside the young murderer Margio but also a literal tiger that can be seen by the villagers. This short, intense and beautiful book was selected for the Man Booker International longlist, making Kurniawan the first Indonesian author to be nominated. Is it really a ghost story? Who cares?</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ghosts-of-the-tsunami-601155.html\">Ghosts of the Tsunami by Richard Lloyd Parry</a> (2017)</strong><br>This award-winning non-fiction account of the 2011 tsunami that claimed tens of thousands of lives in Japan isn\u2019t strictly a ghost story either, but it\u2019s a stunning account of how the living are haunted by the need to reclaim their dead. Parry concentrates on the tragedy of Okawa primary school, which lost all but two of its children. Many of his descriptions will haunt you: for me, it was the bereaved parents training themselves to operate mechanical diggers so they could excavate silt and mud for the bodies of their children long after the official search had given up.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/08/lincoln-in-the-bardo-george-saunders-review\">Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders</a> (2017)</strong><br>This polyphonic tale of multiple ghosts won the 2017 Man Booker prize \u2013 not bad considering it was Saunders\u2019 first novel, although he was already a highly acclaimed short story writer. It concerns the grief of President Abraham Lincoln for his young son William and is an entertaining and heartbreaking reminder that grief afflicts the poor and the mighty in equal measure.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dark-matter-5.html\">Dark Matter by Michelle Paver</a> (2010)<br></strong>This wonderful adult novel from the author of the Chronicles of Ancient Darkness proves what an endlessly inventive writer she is.

      "body": "<p>Ratatouille is one of those dishes that has become so popular worldwide, it\u2019s hard to remember where it came from originally. No mere vegetable stew, ratatouille is only really worth making in high summer: kept in the fridge, it will repay your efforts every time you open the door. Great served warm with barbecued fish or at room temperature with bread, it is a bowl of pure Mediterranean sunshine.</p> <p>Prep <strong>50 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>2 hr 30 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4-6</strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp olive oil, </strong>plus extra to grease<br><strong>2 red peppers</strong><br><strong>\u00bc tsp saffron threads</strong><br><strong>1 medium onion</strong><br><strong>4 garlic cloves</strong><br><strong>8 plum tomatoes</strong><br><strong>1 aubergine</strong><br><strong>3 courgettes </strong>(a mix of yellow and green if possible)<br><strong>3 thyme sprigs, </strong>plus 1 tsp thyme leaves<br><strong>1 tsp balsamic </strong>or red-wine vinegar <br><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, </strong>plus extra to serve</p> <h2><strong>1 Stove vs oven</strong></h2> <p>The secret to a good ratatouille is ensuring that all of the vegetables are perfectly cooked. A more traditional recipe would fry them all separately, then finish it on the stove, but it is easier \u2013 and, I think, more forgiving on the ingredients \u2013 to bake it, as it means you won\u2019t have to keep stirring it to stop it sticking.</p> <h2><strong>2 Choose your vegetables</strong></h2> <p>Note that the vegetables in this recipe are just a guide: if you happen to have more peppers than aubergines, prefer red onions to white, or can\u2019t stand courgettes, then feel free to adapt the recipe to suit your taste or larder \u2013 with the exception of the first lot of tomatoes, which are necessary for the sauce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6353697decc4a834d3ff881a7de938d029ed0873\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6353697decc4a834d3ff881a7de938d029ed0873/891_691_6143_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\u2019s ratatouille: Prepare the vegetables: Halve the peppers lengthways, and discard the innards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prepare the vegetables: Halve the peppers lengthways, and discard the innards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3 Prep the peppers ...</strong></h2> <p>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, and lightly oil a baking tray.

      "bodyText": "Ratatouille is one of those dishes that has become so popular worldwide, it\u2019s hard to remember where it came from originally. No mere vegetable stew, ratatouille is only really worth making in high summer: kept in the fridge, it will repay your efforts every time you open the door. Great served warm with barbecued fish or at room temperature with bread, it is a bowl of pure Mediterranean sunshine. Prep 50 min Cook 2 hr 30 min Serves 4-6 2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to grease 2 red peppers \u00bc tsp saffron threads 1 medium onion 4 garlic cloves 8 plum tomatoes 1 aubergine 3 courgettes (a mix of yellow and green if possible) 3 thyme sprigs, plus 1 tsp thyme leaves 1 tsp balsamic or red-wine vinegar Salt and black pepper 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve 1 Stove vs oven The secret to a good ratatouille is ensuring that all of the vegetables are perfectly cooked. A more traditional recipe would fry them all separately, then finish it on the stove, but it is easier \u2013 and, I think, more forgiving on the ingredients \u2013 to bake it, as it means you won\u2019t have to keep stirring it to stop it sticking. 2 Choose your vegetables Note that the vegetables in this recipe are just a guide: if you happen to have more peppers than aubergines, prefer red onions to white, or can\u2019t stand courgettes, then feel free to adapt the recipe to suit your taste or larder \u2013 with the exception of the first lot of tomatoes, which are necessary for the sauce. 3 Prep the peppers ... Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, and lightly oil a baking tray. Cut the peppers in half lengthways, remove and discard the seeds and any pith, then put them cut-side down on the tray. Bake for about 20 minutes, until the skin has blistered. Take them out and turn the oven down to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3. 4 \u2026 plus the saffron, onion and garlic Meanwhile, put the saffron in a tablespoon of hot water and leave to soak while you prepare the rest of the vegetables. Peel and finely chop the onion, and peel and finely mince three garlic cloves. Alternatively, use a garlic crusher or a pestle and mortar to do the same job. 5 Now for the tomatoes, aubergine and courgettes Peel four of the tomatoes: drop them into a bowl of boiling water for a minute, until the skins split, then slip them off and discard. Cut the peeled tomatoes in half, scoop out and discard the seeds, then finely chop the flesh, retaining any juices. Chop the aubergine, courgettes and the four remaining tomatoes into fairly thin slices. 6 Get the sauce going \u2026 Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat, add the onion and cook until very soft but not browned, stirring regularly. Add the three minced garlic cloves after about five minutes, then gently stir in the tomatoes and their juices. Add the thyme sprigs, and simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated. 7 \u2026 and finish it off Meanwhile, peel the pepper (the skin should just slip off), cut it into small cubes and add to the frying pan, along with the saffron and its soaking water. Cook for a couple more minutes, then remove the thyme sprigs, stir in the vinegar and season to taste. 8 Build the ratatouille Spread the sauce evenly in a medium-sized oven dish, then arrange the sliced vegetables on top in whatever pattern you wish; it\u2019s a good idea to mix them up so everyone gets a bit of everything in each bite. Peel and mince the remaining garlic clove, mix with the extra-virgin olive oil and thyme leaves, season, then drizzle over the top of the dish. 9 Bake it Cover tightly with foil and bake for two hours, until the vegetables are tender, then remove the foil and bake for 30 minutes more. If there is any watery liquid left after cooking, pour this into a small pan, simmer to reduce by half, then pour it back into the dish. Put briefly under the grill to toast the top, then serve warm or at room temperature.",

      "body": "<p>Like many recent years, 2013 saw Richard Dawkins tweet a summary judgment about Islam. \u201cAll the world\u2019s Muslims have fewer Nobel prizes than Trinity College, Cambridge. They did great things in the Middle Ages, though.\u201d The coarse implication in his first statement is hardly softened by the condescending allusion to the \u201cgreat things\u201d done by past Muslims. Still, it was only a tweet. <em>Islamic Empires</em>, Justin Marozzi\u2019s new work, is a 464-page elaboration of the same argument, with additional bloodshed and sleaze.</p> <p>Marozzi opens by quoting a Tunisian friend who is \u201cembarrassed to be an Arab these days\u201d, distressed as he is by the \u201cchaos, fighting, bloodshed, dictatorship, corruption, injustice, unemployment\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests\" title=\"\">plaguing the Middle East</a>. The Tunisian certainly has a point, but it\u2019s one that Marozzi misconstrues. Marozzi advises his friend to think back to a time when \u201cfor an Arab Muslim, pride in occupying the very summit of the global pecking order, rather than shame and embarrassment at languishing in its nether regions, was the order of the day\u201d. But Arab spring protesters, just like this Tunisian, were complaining about their corrupt rulers and calling for a fairer society, not the restoration of what Marozzi calls a \u201cfamed\u201d and \u201cfeared\u201d caliphate in order to satisfy their \u201cpride\u201d.</p> <p>The author offers potted histories of 15 mainly Arab cities across the 15 centuries of Islam. He picks them during their most opulent eras: Baghdad in the ninth century; Cairo in the 12th; Constantinople in the 15th; Isfahan in the 17th; ending with Doha in the 21st. As a journalist, he has visited nearly all the cities he describes, and begins his chapters by speaking to interlocutors often depressed about the state of their country. Then he swiftly whisks us back into a glorious past, emphasising the most lurid tales.</p> <p>First up is Mecca in the seventh century, the city in which the prophet Muhammad was born and which he eventually conquered. Or did he? Like the historian Tom Holland, Marozzi casts doubt on the traditional account of Islam\u2019s origins, speculating that Mecca might not have been where the religion really began. Going down the sceptical route is fair enough \u2013 it\u2019s still a contested issue among academics. But Marozzi\u2019s scepticism is selective. For within a few pages, he is confidently retelling the story of the Prophet condemning to death 700 men from a Jewish tribe that had betrayed him. Does he only trust the sources when there is a juicy story of Muslim violence to tell?</p> <p>I lost count of the number of beheadings and executions in this book, all told with a grisly relish. Muslim chroniclers are Marozzi\u2019s sources, of course, but like all chroniclers they exaggerate for political reasons or simply to impress the reader; it is unlikely, for example, that the eighth-century Abbasid general Abu Muslim \u201ckilled 60,000 people in cold blood\u201d. Then there are the enervating lists of expensive stuff: after his death Harun al-Rashid, the caliph best known from the <em>Arabian Nights</em>, apparently left \u201c4,000 turbans\u201d and \u201c1,000 pieces of the finest porcelain\u201d; a later caliph had \u201c7,000 eunuchs\u201d and \u201c4,000 black pages\u201d. Marozzi has a wide-eyed credulity about such numbers to match that of those literalistic Muslims wedded to every detail of the prophet\u2019s life story.</p> <p>His intellectual history is equally shaky. Rightly, he nods to Baghdad\u2019s library the House of Wisdom and the translation of Greek texts into Arabic, and to the impressive scientific and philosophical work of al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b and al-Kindi. But he simplifies the narrative to suit modern tastes, pitting \u201cconservative clerics with closed minds\u201d against \u201cthe free-wheeling philosophical, religious and scientific discussions\u201d at the Abbasid court. Ignored are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/sharia-law\" title=\"\">sharia</a> scholars who also contributed to Islamic intellectual culture.</p> <p>Consider Ahmad ibn Hanbal, founder of one of the four major schools of Sunni thought. He was flogged during the ninth-century <em>mihna</em> or inquisition, which enforced rationalist interpretations of the Qur\u2019an and persecuted traditionalists. The mihna goes unmentioned here, probably because it complicates the book\u2019s cartoon version of the past in which narrow-minded theologians were outsmarted by philosophers at a court where \u201cdrinking bouts, lavish feasts, orgies and homosexual liaisons\u201d were commonplace.</p> <p>Time and again Marozzi treats us to lusty descriptions of \u201cwine-soaked, hashish-perfumed\u201d parties or the sexual prodigiousness of slave girls. Entertaining enough, if that\u2019s your kind of thing; but the licentiousness is made to bear too much historical weight. He thinks living it large is a quintessential marker of an Islamic empire\u2019s \u201cself-confident pluralism\u201d. He rarely stops to think of what life was like for slave girls wrenched from their distant homes, and whether they were quite so keen on this early form of \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d.</p> <p>Gender relations are not examined with any depth here, even though there is much fascinating material outside elite, male-dominated circles. As Yosef Rapaport has shown, middle-class women in medieval Cairo often initiated divorce \u2013 many had strict pre-nuptial contracts drawn up under the sharia. But Marozzi is too distracted by the Cordoban princess \u201cwho decorated her robes with her own verses celebrating sexual licence, embroidered in gold,\u201d or the tales he hears from a modern Cairene woman about \u201cfree-spirited girls fellating in veils\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A key question \u2013 unanswered here because unasked \u2013 is what actually connects these disparate times and places?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A key question \u2013 unanswered here because unasked \u2013 is what actually connects these disparate times and places? Is there something essentially \u201cIslamic\u201d about violent conquest, louche hedonism and intellectual endeavour? Given that for centuries after the prophet\u2019s death more non-Muslims lived in the caliphate than Muslims, why even label it Islamic? And since these empires were often at war \u2013 Fatimids versus Ayyubids, Safavids versus Ottomans \u2013 can they be lumped together as one \u201ccivilisation\u201d that rises and fades like, in one of Marozzi\u2019s favourite metaphors, a shooting star across the heavens?</p> <p>Of eighth-century Syria, he writes there was \u201ctolerance and more or less harmonious coexistence\u201d between the religions, drawing a melancholy comparison with today\u2019s horrible sectarian war. But can present and past conflicts be explained by reference to whether Islam is essentially \u201ctolerant\u201d or not, as Marozzi seems to think? Such questions have worried well-known historians such as Marshall Hodgson and more recently Shahab Ahmed and Jack Tannous. Their works are absent from the bibliography.</p> <p>As Marozzi surveys the ruins of Kabul and Baghdad and wearily shakes his head over a lost golden age, his story\u2019s looming shadow becomes more conspicuous. For who now heads the \u201cglobal pecking order\u201d? Who invades weaker countries? Who accumulates wealth through technological ingenuity and embraces sexual freedom to the point of decadence? That is a caricature of the west to be sure, but one that Marozzi projects back on to older Islamic empires.</p> <p>The unspoken message to Muslims? Make your nations great again by becoming more like us. So this is less a book about \u201cIslam\u2019s superiority complex\u201d, as the author puts it, than about the west\u2019s.

      "body": "<h2>\u2018Parliament only has itself to blame\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m sorry but parliament only has itself to blame for where we find ourselves. Parliament legislated for a two year period to negotiate a deal with no deal being the default option. They literally made this law. Parliament then proceeded to vote down multiple times the deal that was put to it despite the EU insisting that it was the only and best deal available and despite the WA being required for whatever type of Brexit transpired, even if ultimately staying in the single market. And they voted it down for their own contrived reasons, and ulterior motives. So once again, it is the members of parliament collectively responsible for where we are today. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/132416772\">Ohnoess</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018It will take a strong coalition to fight this outrage\u2019</h2> <p>Now\u2019s the time to stop all tribal warfare \u2013 serious times takes a strong coalition to fight this outrage. All parties came together during the second world war, to fight a foreign enemy, we have an internal enemy who has similar thoughts, to destroy the population and its way of life. So everybody should begin by contacting their MP and tell him/her that if you support this situation, you have lost my vote. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/132420821\">notgotaclue</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018This is 100% unacceptably anti-democratic\u2019</h2> <p>Even as a leave voter, this is 100% unacceptably anti-democratic. It also drags the Queen into the most divisive of issues, further destabilising our political system. It may be that Johnson traps Corbyn into an election over the Brexit deadline, in which case parliament won\u2019t be sitting. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/132416237\">alanww</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018Absolute shambles\u2019</h2> <p>I cannot believe that this is the state of play in a country that was known around the world as a great proponent of democracy. If this goes ahead, by hook or by crook, it gives further credence to (re)forming the constitution and getting rid of the monarchy. Absolute shambles from a cockwomble extraordinaire. Well done, UK. Well done. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/132416494\">awaw1283</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018This puts the Queen in an awful position\u2019</h2> <p>Brexiters, with their alleged love of tradition, might want to reflect on the awful position this is putting the Queen in. I\u2019m personally agnostic on the royals, I don\u2019t think they have any significant role in our governance, and they probably attract tourists, so fine I don\u2019t have problem with them. However, if the Queen was drafted in to support this coup, that would be a different story. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/132420173\">OldSynner</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018The precedent this would set is abominable\u2019</h2> <p>What an absolute travesty. If a government can\u2019t get parliament to support it the correct route is a general election. The precedent this would set is abominable. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/132416245\">GavinlBell</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018Britain has gone from being an out-of-date democracy, to a completely broken one<strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p>If Elizabeth Windsor has any sense, she\u2019ll realise that the game is up.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Parliament only has itself to blame\u2019 I\u2019m sorry but parliament only has itself to blame for where we find ourselves. Parliament legislated for a two year period to negotiate a deal with no deal being the default option. They literally made this law. Parliament then proceeded to vote down multiple times the deal that was put to it despite the EU insisting that it was the only and best deal available and despite the WA being required for whatever type of Brexit transpired, even if ultimately staying in the single market. And they voted it down for their own contrived reasons, and ulterior motives. So once again, it is the members of parliament collectively responsible for where we are today. Ohnoess \u2018It will take a strong coalition to fight this outrage\u2019 Now\u2019s the time to stop all tribal warfare \u2013 serious times takes a strong coalition to fight this outrage. All parties came together during the second world war, to fight a foreign enemy, we have an internal enemy who has similar thoughts, to destroy the population and its way of life. So everybody should begin by contacting their MP and tell him/her that if you support this situation, you have lost my vote. notgotaclue \u2018This is 100% unacceptably anti-democratic\u2019 Even as a leave voter, this is 100% unacceptably anti-democratic. It also drags the Queen into the most divisive of issues, further destabilising our political system. It may be that Johnson traps Corbyn into an election over the Brexit deadline, in which case parliament won\u2019t be sitting. alanww \u2018Absolute shambles\u2019 I cannot believe that this is the state of play in a country that was known around the world as a great proponent of democracy. If this goes ahead, by hook or by crook, it gives further credence to (re)forming the constitution and getting rid of the monarchy. Absolute shambles from a cockwomble extraordinaire. Well done, UK. Well done. awaw1283 \u2018This puts the Queen in an awful position\u2019 Brexiters, with their alleged love of tradition, might want to reflect on the awful position this is putting the Queen in. I\u2019m personally agnostic on the royals, I don\u2019t think they have any significant role in our governance, and they probably attract tourists, so fine I don\u2019t have problem with them. However, if the Queen was drafted in to support this coup, that would be a different story. OldSynner \u2018The precedent this would set is abominable\u2019 What an absolute travesty. If a government can\u2019t get parliament to support it the correct route is a general election. The precedent this would set is abominable. GavinlBell \u2018Britain has gone from being an out-of-date democracy, to a completely broken one\u2019 If Elizabeth Windsor has any sense, she\u2019ll realise that the game is up. Sitting on her hands is no longer a viable option. It\u2019s quite obvious that during the latter part of her reign, Britain has gone from being an out-of-date democracy, to a completely broken one.

The Connecticut-based company, owned by the Sacklers, produces the prescription painkiller OxyContin, which has become emblematic of the opioid epidemic that has claimed the lives of more than 400,000 people in the US over the last 20 years.

That the title, which will move him above Juan Manuel Fangio and behind only Michael Schumacher, is in his grasp is beyond doubt. He has already won eight races, to lead his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas by 62 points, and Hamilton usually only improves on the run-in. Last year he won four of the first five races after the summer break; nine races remain, starting with this weekend\u2019s Belgian grand prix, and with four more victories he will have surpassed his previous best of 11 in a season. Hamilton has been explicit in insisting he is taking nothing for granted yet he is in the form of his life and motivated as never before. Closing out the championship by leaving the opposition scattered and reeling will be his target as Schumacher\u2019s record seven titles looks eminently reachable next season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"685fdade91d41be3e4f4820a06e610d2e9e8ce43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/685fdade91d41be3e4f4820a06e610d2e9e8ce43/0_96_2368_1421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Albon of Toro Rosso at the Hungarian F1 GP\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Albon enjoyed a run to 10th with Toro Rosso in Hungary but now has a chance with Red Bull, starting in Belgium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Fox/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Albon has chance of a lifetime</h2> <p>This time last year Formula One looked a world away for the London-born Thai driver Alexander Albon. Yet when racing resumes he will make his debut for Red Bull in his rookie season after only 12 F1 races. He was set to compete in Formula E\u2019s 2018-19 season until a late call-up to Toro Rosso.

With few alternatives on offer and Red Bull desperate to have a driver to back up Verstappen at the front, a strong performance could secure Albon\u2019s place for next season and beyond. He was impressive in coming up to speed at Toro Rosso with little preparation and the Red Bull should suit his smooth driving style. Albon has an opportunity most drivers can only dream of; how he faces the challenge will be fascinating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/12/red-bull-promote-alexander-albon-to-replace-pierre-gasly-for-rest-of-f1-season\">Red Bull promote Alexander Albon to replace Pierre Gasly for rest of F1 season</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What does the future hold for F1?</h2> <p>After a process that began soon after Liberty took over the sport in 2017, the end-of-October deadline for signing-off new regulations for 2021 looms large. Delayed once this year already, the plan devised by the director of motor sports, Ross Brawn, intended to improve the racing could not be of greater import. What is agreed will shape the sport and what has already been a tortuous process is likely to become increasingly tense as the days count down. Several midfield teams have warned the proposals are in danger of being watered down by the leading marques, who want to maintain their advantage. Equally, a new concorde agreement between competitors and Liberty has yet to be signed for 2021. Confidence in how competitive they can be under the new regulations will play a part for the smaller teams in those negotiations, with Gene Haas already warning F1 has to make sporting and financial sense if teams such as his are to remain. This is the first vital test for F1 in the Liberty era.</p> <h2>All to fight for at Ferrari, Red Bull and McLaren</h2> <p>Mercedes have swept into the distance in the constructors\u2019 championship, 150 points clear of Ferrari, but behind them every race is vital. Ferrari are still struggling with their car and winless, while Red Bull are snapping at their heels thanks to Verstappen\u2019s two victories.

      "bodyText": "Can Hamilton finish with a flourish? Having enjoyed his best opening 12 races, Lewis Hamilton is in position to seal his sixth world championship with his most successful season. That the title, which will move him above Juan Manuel Fangio and behind only Michael Schumacher, is in his grasp is beyond doubt. He has already won eight races, to lead his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas by 62 points, and Hamilton usually only improves on the run-in. Last year he won four of the first five races after the summer break; nine races remain, starting with this weekend\u2019s Belgian grand prix, and with four more victories he will have surpassed his previous best of 11 in a season. Hamilton has been explicit in insisting he is taking nothing for granted yet he is in the form of his life and motivated as never before. Closing out the championship by leaving the opposition scattered and reeling will be his target as Schumacher\u2019s record seven titles looks eminently reachable next season. Albon has chance of a lifetime This time last year Formula One looked a world away for the London-born Thai driver Alexander Albon. Yet when racing resumes he will make his debut for Red Bull in his rookie season after only 12 F1 races. He was set to compete in Formula E\u2019s 2018-19 season until a late call-up to Toro Rosso. He has impressed there and as Pierre Gasly fell apart at Red Bull they unexpectedly promoted the 23-year-old Albon into a race-winning car, alongside the intimidating No 1 driver, Max Verstappen. With few alternatives on offer and Red Bull desperate to have a driver to back up Verstappen at the front, a strong performance could secure Albon\u2019s place for next season and beyond. He was impressive in coming up to speed at Toro Rosso with little preparation and the Red Bull should suit his smooth driving style. Albon has an opportunity most drivers can only dream of; how he faces the challenge will be fascinating. What does the future hold for F1? After a process that began soon after Liberty took over the sport in 2017, the end-of-October deadline for signing-off new regulations for 2021 looms large. Delayed once this year already, the plan devised by the director of motor sports, Ross Brawn, intended to improve the racing could not be of greater import. What is agreed will shape the sport and what has already been a tortuous process is likely to become increasingly tense as the days count down. Several midfield teams have warned the proposals are in danger of being watered down by the leading marques, who want to maintain their advantage. Equally, a new concorde agreement between competitors and Liberty has yet to be signed for 2021. Confidence in how competitive they can be under the new regulations will play a part for the smaller teams in those negotiations, with Gene Haas already warning F1 has to make sporting and financial sense if teams such as his are to remain. This is the first vital test for F1 in the Liberty era. All to fight for at Ferrari, Red Bull and McLaren Mercedes have swept into the distance in the constructors\u2019 championship, 150 points clear of Ferrari, but behind them every race is vital. Ferrari are still struggling with their car and winless, while Red Bull are snapping at their heels thanks to Verstappen\u2019s two victories. They trail the Scuderia by 44 points and the Dutchman is third, ahead of Sebastian Vettel, in the drivers\u2019 championship. Verstappen and Red Bull clearly sense Ferrari blood in the water. The team have gone from strength to strength and if Albon can perform where Gasly failed, they could take the fight for second to the wire. Behind them McLaren are a team reborn with Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz revelling in their competitive car. They are fourth in the championship, 39 points in front of Toro Rosso and 43 in front of Renault.

John McGrane, the director general of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce (BICC), said: \u201cBy redirecting \u20ac1bn from the larger than expected corporate tax intake into a Brexit response fund, government can shore up indigenous businesses which are most at risk from a disorderly Brexit. \u201cFrom the agri-food sector to freight and haulage, SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] across Ireland will need urgent protection.\u201d Ireland has enjoyed what the economist Cormac Lucey recently described as a \u201cstupendous corporation tax windfall\u201d with higher-than-expected tax \u201cwithout precedent in the history of the state\u201d.

It also wants Brexit training for all hauliers and recruitment of more customs agents to support business exporting to the UK in a post-Brexit regime. The BICC, in its submission to the department of finance on the upcoming budget, also called for government investment in higher eduction research links between the UK and Ireland to \u201censure the closest possible relationship with our nearest neighbour into the future\u201d. It specifically calls for a new north-south corridor to forge research and academic links between universities in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. McGrane is particularly concerned that many small- to medium-sized businesses would be caught out and possibly go to the wall because they adopted a wait and see approach to Brexit as they could not afford to develop contingencies. It is widely acknowledged that the Irish agri-food sector would be severely damaged but while big businesses could prepare, smaller businesses in the supply chain in the beef and dairy export trade would be particularly vulnerable.",

MPs would have been due to hold conference recess anyway, from 12 September until 7 October.

On Wednesday morning, the Conservative chairman, James Cleverly, confirmed the move on Twitter, saying that planning to hold a Queen\u2019s speech was something that \u201call new governments do\u201d. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, called the move \u201can utterly scandalous affront to our democracy. We cannot let this happen.\u201d A meeting of opposition MPs, convened by Jeremy Corbyn, agreed on Tuesday to let legislative efforts take priority over a confidence vote in the new government as a mechanism to stop no deal \u2013 a priority that could be changed given the curtailing of the parliamentary timetable. The proposed new timetable would leave MPs with a far narrower window to pass anti-no deal legislation, cutting it short by two weeks, with new dates likely to be: MPs returning on 3 September. A new spending review on 4 September. Parliament prorogued before party conferences on 12 September. Parliament returns for Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October. The EU council meets on 17 October, potentially to agree any new Brexit deal. The UK would be due to leave the EU on 31 October. Rumours swirled in Westminster on Tuesday that plans were afoot to stymie MPs\u2019 efforts to stop no deal after it was revealed that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, would hold a fast-tracked spending review on the day after MPs return to parliament next week, promising a cash boost for schools, hospitals and policing.. The swift timing of the review came as the first major speech by the chancellor was abruptly cancelled by the Treasury with less than 24 hours\u2019 notice. A Treasury spokesman said the speech had been cancelled because the one-year spending review, called a spending round, which had been expected to take place later this autumn, was being fast-tracked. Javid, writing in the Daily Telegraph, suggested he would not break his predecessor Philip Hammond\u2019s strict fiscal rules, saying the government could \u201cafford to spend more on the people\u2019s priorities \u2013 without breaking the rules around what the government should spend \u2013 and we\u2019ll do that in a few key areas like schools, hospitals and police.\u201d The chancellor said his economic priorities were health, education and policing, suggesting that other key areas including housing may get overlooked for major investment.

It\u2019s a one off pre-election panic-driven stunt budget. Whitehall sources suggested there was considerable concern MPs could trigger a vote of no confidence in the government and an early general election, which could lead to departments being left in the dark about spending plans, with budgets running out in 2020. \u201cWe want people to be able to plan and there is a reason it is in early September because of the risks when MPs return to the house that week,\u201d one source said.

      "body": "<p>When I arrive at the photography studio to meet the education activist Marley Dias, I am surprised to find the shoot is long over. The 14-year-old is sitting patiently, her luggage packed, coat neatly slung over her lap, waiting. The photographer explains the early finish is because they got all the pictures they needed with Dias near-immediately; that she is the perfect subject to work with.</p> <p>This was perhaps the first inkling of what would become abundantly clear during our interview: Marley Dias is a pro. Despite her tender years, the campaigner for diverse children\u2019s books \u2013 which took her from her New Jersey home town to the White House \u2013 carries herself with a mature confidence, and a wherewithal perhaps born from deeply held conviction.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in an unfair world and we have to fight,\u201d she says, leaning forward in her seat, her elbow resting on the table. She is wearing a vivacious green jumpsuit, the outfit of someone who is not afraid to be seen. Her role is, Dias explains, to \u201cmotivate young girls, regardless of their race or their experience, to get out there and do the things you love and that will help other people\u201d.</p> <p>Dias was 10 the day she came home from school to eat pancakes with her mother and vented her frustration at being assigned to read Where the Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls.

My great-grandparents remember when that book came out. I read it last year and it was still assigned. Every single year they wanted us to read a book about a white boy and his dog.\u201d</p> <p>Dias decided \u2013 at 10 years old \u2013 to collect books with black girl leads to raise awareness of books with diverse characters and the overrepresentation of books with white leads in the school system. <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/09/marley-dias-1000-black-girl-books-hits-target-with-outpouring-of-donations\" title=\"\">Her target was 1,000 books</a>, which she would then send to a school in Jamaica that her mother had attended. \u201cI didn\u2019t pick my own school because I realised that even in all-black spaces like Jamaica, where it is majority black people, they don\u2019t see themselves, and the narratives of white people are still being pushed on to people.\u201d</p> <p>She created a hashtag, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/1000BlackGirlBooks\" title=\"\">#1000BlackGirlBooks</a>, which started to pick up pace and soon catapulted the young Dias into the limelight. \u201cTwo of the first books I collected were Grace for President by Kelly DiPucchio and Brown Girl Dreaming by Jacqueline Woodson,\u201d she says. Since the campaign launch in 2016 she has collected well over 12,000 books, organised a reading party at the White House, shared a stage with Oprah Winfrey, appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and guest-edited a special edition of Elle magazine \u2013 all while keeping up with her classes and doing her homework. What is that like for her? \u201cI don\u2019t really bring it up at school. Although I\u2019m sure the kids at school know because they follow me on Instagram.\u201d</p> <p>Hearing Dias tell the stories of when those worlds collide is one of just a few moments where she seems her age (the other times are when she notes what trainers I\u2019m wearing, and playfully groans when I say I still have more questions). She giggles through a story about how her friends responded to her getting the phone number of Rowan Blanchard, an actor on the Disney Channel, at the Teen Vogue Summit.</p> <p>\u201cThey just freaked out! And obviously I don\u2019t give out people\u2019s phone numbers, but I used to love her and that whole show and then two years later \u2026 wow.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then another thing,\u201d she continues, giddily, \u201cwas at that same summit, Reese Witherspoon \u2013 she\u2019s a great actor, a huge celebrity. I don\u2019t watch Reese Witherspoon movies though, I\u2019m too young \u2013 but her daughter and I are friends now! We\u2019re actually friends! That\u2019s a weird thing to think about.

I can get lonely sometimes, too, because not many girls my age are doing what I do. But I am doing this because I love to read, I love books, I love being here, I am passionate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d15b130736a4ecc8dff29c2d9a2bf02c95dae0fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d15b130736a4ecc8dff29c2d9a2bf02c95dae0fa/0_0_6996_4656/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marley Dias\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The photographer explains the early finish is because they got all the pictures they needed with Dias near-immediately ...\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Dias, passions have power and are a vital part of an energy that can \u201cchange the world\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re passionate about makeup, and you use that passion to highlight social issues, people will connect with your authenticity.</p> <p>\u201cOne author that I love is Tomi Adeyemi; she wrote Children of Blood and Bone, an African fantasy story. We don\u2019t often see black people in futuristic and magical worlds. So she\u2019s taken a genre that has always been a majority white space, and she\u2019s taken some of her own history of being an African American person, and she\u2019s moulded that into something that\u2019s not just a slavery story and is about the history of Africa and in a positive light. For the black kids out there, who really love fantasy but never see themselves, they now feel a whole new level of connection. That\u2019s important.\u201d</p> <p>The girl activist has become a prominent figure in our time \u2013 Greta Thunberg, the climate change activist; Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel prize winner campaigning for girls\u2019 education; and Emma Gonzales, a US advocate for gun control, to name just three. Why are we seeing fewer teenage boys fulfil these roles?</p> <p>\u201cI think our parents push for us [girls] to understand that we\u2019re connected to other people at a younger age. Boys\u2019 games are about conflicts, and fake fighting. And that translates into real life. You see it in school; if something bad happens, boys say: \u2018I\u2019m not with them, I don\u2019t connect to them, I\u2019m separate.\u2019 But with girls, we play family, we play house. We think about others. Maybe that [has made] us more inclined to be activists.\u201d</p> <p>Dias\u2019s debut, Marley Dias Gets it Done: And So Can You! is an autobiography-cum-toolkit for the young activist girl. A collection of stories and advice, it also provides an insight into Dias\u2019s world, from the clothes she likes to the encouraging influence of her parents (Dias urges all her teen readers to listen to their parents). The book also spends time emphasising the importance of reading for young people, but it does not talk about economics and the relationship between wealth and educational outcomes for people of colour.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of economic segregation where I live, and it\u2019s a very important issue. The only reason why it\u2019s not in the book is because I just didn\u2019t really know a lot about it at the time I was writing. I was 11. I address economic inequality now, in my speaking engagements, but at the time I wasn\u2019t aware. I could have got my mum to help me, she would have been great, but then the book wouldn\u2019t be from me.\u201d</p> <p>Dias\u2019s mother, Dr Janice Johnson Dias, is in the room during our interview (standard practice when interviewing a minor). Johnson Dias is the founder of GrassROOTS, a community foundation focusing on women\u2019s public health, especially those from lower-income households. I ask Johnson Dias how she resisted the urge not to nudge her daughter into covering a subject so close to her heart?</p> <p>\u201cThe role of parents is to make space for their children\u2019s real voice, even their mistakes. Not that I think there\u2019s a lot of mistakes, but I\u2019m an economic sociologist and so thinking about literacy in our own neighbourhood, I just know way too much. It wouldn\u2019t have sounded like her. It wouldn\u2019t have been her.

      "bodyText": "When I arrive at the photography studio to meet the education activist Marley Dias, I am surprised to find the shoot is long over. The 14-year-old is sitting patiently, her luggage packed, coat neatly slung over her lap, waiting. The photographer explains the early finish is because they got all the pictures they needed with Dias near-immediately; that she is the perfect subject to work with. This was perhaps the first inkling of what would become abundantly clear during our interview: Marley Dias is a pro. Despite her tender years, the campaigner for diverse children\u2019s books \u2013 which took her from her New Jersey home town to the White House \u2013 carries herself with a mature confidence, and a wherewithal perhaps born from deeply held conviction. \u201cWe live in an unfair world and we have to fight,\u201d she says, leaning forward in her seat, her elbow resting on the table. She is wearing a vivacious green jumpsuit, the outfit of someone who is not afraid to be seen. Her role is, Dias explains, to \u201cmotivate young girls, regardless of their race or their experience, to get out there and do the things you love and that will help other people\u201d. Dias was 10 the day she came home from school to eat pancakes with her mother and vented her frustration at being assigned to read Where the Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls. Again. \u201cIt is one of those \u2018classic books\u2019 that\u2019s existed in our school systems for so long. My great-grandparents remember when that book came out. I read it last year and it was still assigned. Every single year they wanted us to read a book about a white boy and his dog.\u201d Dias decided \u2013 at 10 years old \u2013 to collect books with black girl leads to raise awareness of books with diverse characters and the overrepresentation of books with white leads in the school system. Her target was 1,000 books, which she would then send to a school in Jamaica that her mother had attended. \u201cI didn\u2019t pick my own school because I realised that even in all-black spaces like Jamaica, where it is majority black people, they don\u2019t see themselves, and the narratives of white people are still being pushed on to people.\u201d She created a hashtag, #1000BlackGirlBooks, which started to pick up pace and soon catapulted the young Dias into the limelight. \u201cTwo of the first books I collected were Grace for President by Kelly DiPucchio and Brown Girl Dreaming by Jacqueline Woodson,\u201d she says. Since the campaign launch in 2016 she has collected well over 12,000 books, organised a reading party at the White House, shared a stage with Oprah Winfrey, appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and guest-edited a special edition of Elle magazine \u2013 all while keeping up with her classes and doing her homework. What is that like for her? \u201cI don\u2019t really bring it up at school. Although I\u2019m sure the kids at school know because they follow me on Instagram.\u201d Hearing Dias tell the stories of when those worlds collide is one of just a few moments where she seems her age (the other times are when she notes what trainers I\u2019m wearing, and playfully groans when I say I still have more questions). She giggles through a story about how her friends responded to her getting the phone number of Rowan Blanchard, an actor on the Disney Channel, at the Teen Vogue Summit. \u201cThey just freaked out! And obviously I don\u2019t give out people\u2019s phone numbers, but I used to love her and that whole show and then two years later \u2026 wow. \u201cAnd then another thing,\u201d she continues, giddily, \u201cwas at that same summit, Reese Witherspoon \u2013 she\u2019s a great actor, a huge celebrity. I don\u2019t watch Reese Witherspoon movies though, I\u2019m too young \u2013 but her daughter and I are friends now! We\u2019re actually friends! That\u2019s a weird thing to think about. It\u2019s fun but I also don\u2019t want people to think that I do it just because of those relationships.\u201d Dias reflects that although she isn\u2019t as famous as, for example, some child actors, she has begun to empathise with how they might feel. \u201cThey always say: \u2018I\u2019m just a kid and I want to be just a normal kid.\u2019 And I understand that because I know that I don\u2019t want to feel like a weirdo. I can get lonely sometimes, too, because not many girls my age are doing what I do. But I am doing this because I love to read, I love books, I love being here, I am passionate.\u201d For Dias, passions have power and are a vital part of an energy that can \u201cchange the world\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re passionate about makeup, and you use that passion to highlight social issues, people will connect with your authenticity. \u201cOne author that I love is Tomi Adeyemi; she wrote Children of Blood and Bone, an African fantasy story. We don\u2019t often see black people in futuristic and magical worlds. So she\u2019s taken a genre that has always been a majority white space, and she\u2019s taken some of her own history of being an African American person, and she\u2019s moulded that into something that\u2019s not just a slavery story and is about the history of Africa and in a positive light. For the black kids out there, who really love fantasy but never see themselves, they now feel a whole new level of connection. That\u2019s important.\u201d The girl activist has become a prominent figure in our time \u2013 Greta Thunberg, the climate change activist; Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel prize winner campaigning for girls\u2019 education; and Emma Gonzales, a US advocate for gun control, to name just three.

      "body": "<p>\u201cWe\u2019re all seen as people catching flies in their mouth and talking to Jesus while wearing tin helmets,\u201d says Chris Dowling*, who is being treated for mental health problems that include depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p>\u201cMental health needn\u2019t be that debilitating, but even my own family \u2026 it\u2019s almost as if they think it\u2019s contagious. They steer clear of me,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe have to shift the outdated Victorian connotations of what mental health is.\u201d</p> <p>Dowling is a patient at <a href=\"https://www.stah.org/who-we-are/locations/essex/\">St </a><a href=\"https://www.stah.org/who-we-are/locations/essex/\">Andrew\u2019s Healthcare</a>, a low-secure unit near Wickford, Essex. It\u2019s for people who have been sectioned under the Mental Health Act, which deems they are in need of urgent treatment for a mental health disorder and are at risk of harm to themselves or others. The hospital he\u2019s in requires people to enter and exit through an airlock; staff and visitors are required to wear a personal alarm and there\u2019s a long list of restricted items, including mobile phones. Patients work up to being let out on day trips with a member of staff before gaining independent leave and ultimately, if suitable, being discharged back into the community. Some patients are there for a matter of weeks; others stay for years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"On the ward podcast\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://www.buzzsprout.com/553780/1609204-s1-ep1-on-the-ward-life.js?player=small&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In 2017-18, there were around <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-act-statistics-annual-figures/2017-18-annual-figures\">50,000 detentions under the Mental Health Act</a>, but a huge amount of mystery shrouds what psychiatric hospitals are like. With a lack of voices emerging from these hospitals, people have been left to picture a distorted version of reality, exacerbated by films such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest and Silence of the Lambs, or stories in the media about violent attacks.</p> <p>But one mental health nurse is on a mission to change this perception by recording a podcast about life on a men\u2019s ward, featuring both patient and staff voices. John-Barry Waldron is a recently qualified nurse who has worked at St Andrew\u2019s Healthcare for more than 10 years (he was a support worker when he started). He admits: \u201cAs soon as I explain to people where I work, they get images of straitjackets and staff dressed all in white. It\u2019s different to that.\u201d The motivation behind the podcast was to get patients\u2019 voices out there, he adds. \u201cThey\u2019re not heard, they\u2019re not seen. This [podcast] is to change that.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.buzzsprout.com/553780/1609204-s1-ep1-on-the-ward-life\">five-part podcast</a> focuses on a different patient each episode, as well as members of staff who have had a close working relationship with that individual. One patient who features in the series is Adam, in his late 30s, who talks about his journey with paranoid schizophrenia. He says: \u201cI was a nightmare when I first came here three years ago. I\u2019d shower with my clothes on, take them off in public, piss everywhere. My recovery is a miracle, really.\u201d</p> <p>Adam is now allowed to go out unaccompanied every day, and he writes poetry, enjoys dancing and is part of a local church group in the community. He\u2019s keen to show others that recovery is possible, which is why he\u2019s shared his story. \u201cI thought it might be helpful for people in the future, for those who think they won\u2019t get better.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, the podcast doesn\u2019t portray a perfect world. Waldron says that patients are sometimes here when they don\u2019t want to be. One patient who talks about how football has helped with his recovery on an episode of the podcast says it\u2019s \u201cshit\u201d being on the ward and that he can\u2019t wait to get out. But in the same conversation he talks about all the friendships and happy memories he\u2019s made.</p> <p>With the podcast, Waldron also aims to show the reality of staff\u2019s working lives at the hospital \u2013 an assistant psychologist, a gym instructor, a fellow nurse and others feature in the series.</p> <p>He admits the job can be incredibly difficult. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy working in a place like this because patients are sometimes quite volatile. You have to deal with things that are tough. You might have patients who self-harm \u2013 they might cut their arms and attempt to tie things around their neck. That\u2019s quite hard to see.\u201d Patient violence and the effect on members of staff is also discussed \u2013 Waldron himself has been attacked two times.</p> <p>But Dowling is just happy to be getting the help he craved for so long. It took one suicide attempt and admitting that he was preparing another to convince medical professionals to section him.</p> <p>He finds it hard to comprehend the huge amount of stigma that surrounds mental health. \u201cPeople are so misinformed about the good work going on,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite shocking in this day and age.\u201d</p> <p>* Names have been changed.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe\u2019re all seen as people catching flies in their mouth and talking to Jesus while wearing tin helmets,\u201d says Chris Dowling*, who is being treated for mental health problems that include depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cMental health needn\u2019t be that debilitating, but even my own family \u2026 it\u2019s almost as if they think it\u2019s contagious. They steer clear of me,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe have to shift the outdated Victorian connotations of what mental health is.\u201d Dowling is a patient at St Andrew\u2019s Healthcare, a low-secure unit near Wickford, Essex. It\u2019s for people who have been sectioned under the Mental Health Act, which deems they are in need of urgent treatment for a mental health disorder and are at risk of harm to themselves or others. The hospital he\u2019s in requires people to enter and exit through an airlock; staff and visitors are required to wear a personal alarm and there\u2019s a long list of restricted items, including mobile phones. Patients work up to being let out on day trips with a member of staff before gaining independent leave and ultimately, if suitable, being discharged back into the community. Some patients are there for a matter of weeks; others stay for years. In 2017-18, there were around 50,000 detentions under the Mental Health Act, but a huge amount of mystery shrouds what psychiatric hospitals are like. With a lack of voices emerging from these hospitals, people have been left to picture a distorted version of reality, exacerbated by films such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest and Silence of the Lambs, or stories in the media about violent attacks. But one mental health nurse is on a mission to change this perception by recording a podcast about life on a men\u2019s ward, featuring both patient and staff voices. John-Barry Waldron is a recently qualified nurse who has worked at St Andrew\u2019s Healthcare for more than 10 years (he was a support worker when he started). He admits: \u201cAs soon as I explain to people where I work, they get images of straitjackets and staff dressed all in white. It\u2019s different to that.\u201d The motivation behind the podcast was to get patients\u2019 voices out there, he adds. \u201cThey\u2019re not heard, they\u2019re not seen. This [podcast] is to change that.\u201d The five-part podcast focuses on a different patient each episode, as well as members of staff who have had a close working relationship with that individual. One patient who features in the series is Adam, in his late 30s, who talks about his journey with paranoid schizophrenia. He says: \u201cI was a nightmare when I first came here three years ago. I\u2019d shower with my clothes on, take them off in public, piss everywhere. My recovery is a miracle, really.\u201d Adam is now allowed to go out unaccompanied every day, and he writes poetry, enjoys dancing and is part of a local church group in the community. He\u2019s keen to show others that recovery is possible, which is why he\u2019s shared his story. \u201cI thought it might be helpful for people in the future, for those who think they won\u2019t get better.\u201d Of course, the podcast doesn\u2019t portray a perfect world. Waldron says that patients are sometimes here when they don\u2019t want to be. One patient who talks about how football has helped with his recovery on an episode of the podcast says it\u2019s \u201cshit\u201d being on the ward and that he can\u2019t wait to get out. But in the same conversation he talks about all the friendships and happy memories he\u2019s made. With the podcast, Waldron also aims to show the reality of staff\u2019s working lives at the hospital \u2013 an assistant psychologist, a gym instructor, a fellow nurse and others feature in the series. He admits the job can be incredibly difficult. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy working in a place like this because patients are sometimes quite volatile. You have to deal with things that are tough. You might have patients who self-harm \u2013 they might cut their arms and attempt to tie things around their neck. That\u2019s quite hard to see.\u201d Patient violence and the effect on members of staff is also discussed \u2013 Waldron himself has been attacked two times. But Dowling is just happy to be getting the help he craved for so long. It took one suicide attempt and admitting that he was preparing another to convince medical professionals to section him. He finds it hard to comprehend the huge amount of stigma that surrounds mental health. \u201cPeople are so misinformed about the good work going on,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite shocking in this day and age.\u201d * Names have been changed.

The longstanding rivals are under pressure to present a convincing pact to the president, Sergio Mattarella, on Wednesday. Discussions have been hampered because of clashes over who would lead the coalition and who would hold ministry positions. The PD succumbed to demands from M5S for Giuseppe Conte, who last week ended the fraught alliance between the party and the far-right League, to be reinstated as prime minister. The PD has insisted that the M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, steps down as deputy prime minister in return. To complicate matters, M5S said it would ask members to vote on any deal agreed with the PD on Rousseau, the online network it often uses to make policy decisions. The vote would only takes place if Mattarella gives the parties a mandate to form a government. The chaos was prompted by the deputy PM and interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who dramatically withdrew the League from its coalition government with M5S this month as he sought to exploit his high popularity to force snap elections in an effort to become the next prime minister.

      "body": "<p>By five o\u2019clock on a Saturday evening, the parking lot outside the Hospitality House in Alderson, West Virginia is filling up fast. From my car, I watch as little girl in a pink jacket jumps from a New Jersey plated van.</p> <p>\u201cBut why can\u2019t Mom come stay with us here for just one night?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>A muffled adult voice answers incoherently from inside the van and then a boy bounces out and turns around.</p> <p>\u201cThis don\u2019t look like no hotel,\u201d he yells. \u201cWhat\u2019s this supposed to be? Some white boy\u2019s grandma\u2019s house?\u201d</p> <p>The three-story Victorian does look rather grandmotherly, a little weather-beaten but in a well-loved kind of way. Since 1976, it has served as a pay-what-you-can bed-and-breakfast for the visiting loved ones of the women incarcerated at Federal Prison Camp, Alderson \u2013 the prison made famous by Martha Stewart, who spent five months there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"story break\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">story break</a> </figure>  <p>Inside, Brian DeRouen is busy tending the wood stove. He and his wife, Kathleen, moved to the area in 2007 to join a Catholic intentional community but they became interested in the Alderson Hospitality House and took over running the place. Brian himself was incarcerated for an act of civil disobedience at Fort Benning, Georgia back in 2005 and so the couple have a personal passion for criminal justice reform work.</p> <p>I have been a volunteer here on and off for 15 years and, recently, dropping in most weekends to help prepare meals.</p> <p>Octavia, a woman with short gray hair and a National Parks sweatshirt, is setting out the silverware.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says as I approach. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019re you doing?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cA little sad,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is my last visit with my Angela \u2019til spring. What with the snow in the mountains, I can\u2019t risk getting stuck here.\u201d</p> <p>Octavia travels by train for 12 hours to visit her daughter-in-law, Angela. She visits her as often as she can get the train ticket money together. Her son can\u2019t make it out to see his wife right now she says, but seems hesitant to go into details. Here, no one presses anyone for anything they don\u2019t want to share. There is an unspoken understanding: no one expected to be in this situation, but here they are.</p> <p>This is certainly not how Octavia thought she would spend her retirement; she had planned on buying an RV and joining tours of the Grand Canyon and the Rocky Mountains, but instead she is putting money into her daughter-in-law\u2019s commissary account and traveling to a town in West Virginia she\u2019d never heard of before.</p> <p>The front door bangs open and a woman with shiny blonde hair and bedazzled jeans joins us at the buffet table. This is Barbara, from coastal Virginia. She is quick to smile but her blue eyes hold pain. She comes to visit her daughter, Brandy, whenever she can get a weekend off from her home health nursing job, and whenever her back pain lets up enough for her to drive.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been getting acupuncture, which really helps,\u201d she says. \u201cBut man, that stuff\u2019s expensive and what with the money I gotta give Brandy for her commissary \u2026 sometimes it\u2019s between that and having the gas money to come visit. Did you know they don\u2019t even give \u2019em shampoo and conditioner? Just this powdered detergent shit, excuse my language. If you want shampoo, you gotta buy it.\u201d</p> <p>Octavia nods in agreement. \u201cYou can spend $250 a month easy, just helping them get the littlest necessities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew I had to come this weekend though,\u201d Barbara says. \u201cIt\u2019d been three months since I seen my baby.\u201d She has a habit of pushing her fingers into the inside corners of her eyes when she talks about emotional things. \u201cI was so glad there was space for me here at the House. The first couple times I came up to visit Brandy, I\u2019d go over to the River Rest motel after visits, lock myself in that room and cry all night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlus, here you know everybody understands,\u201d says Octavia.</p> <p>\u201cHere we\u2019re all one big family!\u201d a voice booms.</p> <p>We look up to see Chris walk in carrying a grocery store cake with pink icing.</p> <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Kathleen says, tipping her head towards me as she carries a steaming pot of spaghetti to the sink, \u201cthis place really is family to Mesha. She wouldn\u2019t exist without it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer parents met here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52bcddd3cb067e939b73e88c2e43074aeb5aaaf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52bcddd3cb067e939b73e88c2e43074aeb5aaaf5/0_0_5832_3823/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cHere we\u2019re all one big family,\u201d Chris says, sharing a cake at the Alderson Hospitality House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cHere we\u2019re all one big family,\u201d Chris says, sharing a cake at the Alderson Hospitality House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Dev Murphy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it\u2019s true. I wouldn\u2019t exist if Sara Jane Moore hadn\u2019t escaped from the prison in 1979.</p> <p>Moore was serving a life sentence for attempting to assassinate Gerald Ford and on 5 February, she <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/06/archives/sara-jane-moore-in-a-futile-escape.html\">scaled the chainlink fence</a> and walked to the Hospitality House, where she told one of the volunteers that her car had broken down in the snow and she desperately needed a ride to the bus station in the next town.</p> <p>It was not until after he had already transported Moore that David Shelton Ross realized who she was. He called the police immediately but that was not enough to assuage suspicion against the house workers. The following summer, when Moore was prosecuted for her escape, all of the Hospitality House workers were mandated to the trial and there was no one left to run the House. The founders, Dick Dieter and Maggie Louden, put the word out to various social justice organizations and a man named Sam Maren answered the call.</p> <p>My father was 23 when he agreed to take the job. He had been on the road, up in DC protesting the closure of a homeless shelter and then down in Florida picking oranges, and thought he\u2019d take a break to help out. On the days when he wasn\u2019t busy cooking for the guests, he practiced his saxophone on the balcony and happened to catch the eye of a woman living in an apartment across the street. I was born five years later.</p> <p>Back in the kitchen, Kathleen rings the dinner bell and guests wrap around the room in a single file line.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes this reminds me of our ladies, lining up for chow,\u201d one man says quietly. \u201cExcept for this food is real good.\u201d</p> <p>I think about how that phrase \u2013 \u201cour ladies\u201d \u2013 acknowledges the sadness in each and every guest. It amazes me sometimes how few words are necessary to unite the guests here, despite the obvious differences in race, class, and political leanings.</p> <p>Reflecting on this, Brian DeRouen said, \u201cIn normal life, we don\u2019t sit down regularly and talk with people that we disagree with, but here at The House, folks do. They not only interact, they share meals. In normal life, half of them would be at Arby\u2019s and the other half at some fancy restaurant, but here they are together. The fact of having someone they love at the camp is really equalizing. No matter how big the differences, the commonality is bigger.\u201d</p> <p>DeRouen recalled a moment when Democratic US Representative John Conyers was visiting his wife, Monica, who was serving time for conspiring to commit bribery, and after dinner a group of guests were sitting in the living room watching the news. The coverage was of the Democratic National Convention and the majority of the guests in the living room were criticizing the Democratic party, using very vulgar language, when suddenly Conyers himself appeared on the screen. Everyone in the room did a double take and then looked over at Conyers where he sat at the end of the sofa.</p> <p>He had told the other guests that he was from Detroit but he had not mentioned what he did there. The other guests rushed to apologize for the way they had been talking but he just laughed and shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t get very far as a politician if you don\u2019t have thick skin,\u201d he said. The result was a lively, but very respectful, political conversation that lasted until 2am.</p> <p>DeRouen points out that people\u2019s voting tendencies don\u2019t necessarily change after interactions like that, but it does become more obvious to everyone how surface level the supposedly big differences between people are in comparison to the depths of the human experience.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 that bimbo in the White House,\u201d someone behind me says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to offend, but \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, I really wish I hadn\u2019t voted for him,\u201d Barbara says. \u201cIt seemed like the right thing to do at the time but the more he keeps talking and tweeting, the more I think he might not be telling us the truth.\u201d</p> <p>There are a few groans from others in line, a little awkward silence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2892c9203cbe26d2b02ee13e92b5e23ff9f35861\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2892c9203cbe26d2b02ee13e92b5e23ff9f35861/0_0_6009_3937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It amazes me sometimes how few words are necessary to unite the guests here, despite the obvious differences in race, class, and political leanings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It amazes me sometimes how few words are necessary to unite the guests here, despite the obvious differences in race, class, and political leanings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Dev Murphy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOh, hey,\u201d Chris calls from the end of the counter. \u201cThere\u2019s cake over there, too, for everybody. It\u2019s my wife\u2019s birthday! The girls up at the camp are making her something special in the unit tonight, something like cheesecake they know how to make with Sprite and nondairy creamers and strawberry jelly. Anyways, I told her since I can\u2019t bring her a cake to the visiting room that we\u2019d celebrate here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, happy birthday! Do we have a date yet?\u201d Kathleen asks. By \u201cdate\u201d she means a scheduled release date for Chris\u2019s wife, and with the \u201cwe\u201d she manages to draw us all in.</p> <p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Chris says. \u201cFebruary 23rd.\u201d</p> <p>A cheer goes up across the room.</p> <p>Chris\u2019s face is glowing, but a moment later his eyes wrinkle with worry. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good thing she\u2019s getting out of there now too,\u201d he says to no one in particular. \u201cIt\u2019s changed a lot in there, they\u2019re bringing in all kinds of drug criminals now. It used to be white collar crimes but now that\u2019s all changing and there are women from MS-13 in there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s MS-13?\u201d Kathleen asks.</p> <p>\u201cA gang,\u201d Chris says, \u201clike the Mexican mafia.\u201d (I don\u2019t tell him the gang originated in Los Angeles).</p> <p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s no fence up there so there\u2019s all sorts of stuff coming in, just getting brought in by the gang girls. There\u2019s a lot more strip searches going on now because they keep finding so much stuff in there. That\u2019s what\u2019s so awful for my Nancy, she messes up on some bookkeeping paperwork and next thing you know she\u2019s in prison being stripped naked and searched for drugs. They ought have a different prison for women like Nancy \u2013 and a different word, like something that says you broke the law, okay, yes, but you\u2019re not, like, a drug criminal.\u201d</p> <p>An unease settles over the line as Chris keeps talking. When he takes his plate to a table and sits down, Barbara turns to me.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bunch of horseshit,\u201d she whispers. \u201cSorry, excuse me, but if there\u2019s anybody you ought to feel sorry for above the others, it\u2019s the girls with drug charges, like my Brandy. She\u2019s one of the only one\u2019s up there for drugs and so everybody just, you know, looks at her weird.\u201d</p> <p>Octavia, Barbara and I fill our plates and sit at a table together, but Barbara just picks at her food.</p> <p>\u201cThey act like she murdered the guy. My Brandy,\u201d Barbara shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t even see how it happened. I mean one minute she was in tech school, getting good grades and she was modeling, beautiful girl, and then she\u2019s hooked on this stuff. And then she\u2019s selling. She helped sell to a doctor\u2019s son, that\u2019s how they got her. She went and gave him the heroin and new needles and took the old needles and the hundred dollars and went back to her friend\u2019s car and then the guy went to a party and somebody helped him shoot up and he died and they pinned it on her.\u201d</p> <p>Octavia nods. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, I know it.\u201d</p> <p>We let silence fall over the table for a while. Chris has finished eating and is helping to clear away other people\u2019s plates, completely unaware that he has rankled anyone. This is one of the few times of unease between guests that I\u2019ve ever encountered here and that, I realize now, is rather miraculous, especially in the current political climate. Where else could you find a room with 50 people with so many different backgrounds doing their best to help each other shoulder a common pain?</p> <p>\u201cCake?\u201d Chris approaches with dessert plates in hand.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want any,\u201d Barbara snaps. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m being rude,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this birthday stuff has got me thinking about Jason. That\u2019s my son. His birthday is tomorrow. Well, it woulda been.\u201d</p> <p>Chris hovers at the end of the table, looking truly concerned. \u201cHe passed away?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree years ago, now,\u201d she says. \u201cOverdose.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d been clean and living with her. That night they had dinner together and Barbara was watching TV. She called down the hall to Jason: did he want the last biscuit? He loved biscuits, she says, and now she still can\u2019t really look at a can of biscuits without crying. Anyhow, he\u2019d come up and got the biscuit and wrapped it in a paper towel and took it back down there with him and then Barbara must have fallen asleep.</p> <p>When she woke up Jo Jo, Jason\u2019s dog, was scratching at Jason\u2019s bedroom door from the inside, sticking his paws out from under the door. Barbara called to Jason to open the door. Jo Jo needs out, she\u2019d said, but he didn\u2019t answer. She tried the door and it was locked and that\u2019s when she freaked out. The Christmas before she had found him unconscious. They had been hanging lights on the tree. She had told him they were crooked and he had taken them all back off, bless his heart, and did it again until she was happy. Then he had gone down the hall and it wasn\u2019t ten minutes later he\u2019d shot up and she found him and had to do CPR and call the ambulance.</p> <p>This was not an unfamiliar situation to Barbara. She broke down the door this time and got in there and there was a needle and spoon and he was out. She tried CPR. If I could just get him breathing again, she said, looking around the table at us, if I could just get him to breathe.</p> <p>It was the most helpless feeling, Jo Jo was there and wouldn\u2019t leave his side and then the other dog came in and was snuffling around, eating biscuit crumbs from the napkin Jason had left on the bed.</p> <p>His daughter was almost five when he died. She looks just like him, Barbara says. She is now six and still not potty-trained, she uses Pull-Ups and sucks a pacifier. She says she thinks the girl needs counseling.</p> <p>Octavia gets up quietly from the table.

      "bodyText": "By five o\u2019clock on a Saturday evening, the parking lot outside the Hospitality House in Alderson, West Virginia is filling up fast. From my car, I watch as little girl in a pink jacket jumps from a New Jersey plated van. \u201cBut why can\u2019t Mom come stay with us here for just one night?\u201d she asks. A muffled adult voice answers incoherently from inside the van and then a boy bounces out and turns around. \u201cThis don\u2019t look like no hotel,\u201d he yells. \u201cWhat\u2019s this supposed to be? Some white boy\u2019s grandma\u2019s house?\u201d The three-story Victorian does look rather grandmotherly, a little weather-beaten but in a well-loved kind of way. Since 1976, it has served as a pay-what-you-can bed-and-breakfast for the visiting loved ones of the women incarcerated at Federal Prison Camp, Alderson \u2013 the prison made famous by Martha Stewart, who spent five months there. Inside, Brian DeRouen is busy tending the wood stove. He and his wife, Kathleen, moved to the area in 2007 to join a Catholic intentional community but they became interested in the Alderson Hospitality House and took over running the place. Brian himself was incarcerated for an act of civil disobedience at Fort Benning, Georgia back in 2005 and so the couple have a personal passion for criminal justice reform work. I have been a volunteer here on and off for 15 years and, recently, dropping in most weekends to help prepare meals. Octavia, a woman with short gray hair and a National Parks sweatshirt, is setting out the silverware. \u201cHey,\u201d she says as I approach. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d \u201cHow\u2019re you doing?\u201d I ask. She shakes her head. \u201cA little sad,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is my last visit with my Angela \u2019til spring. What with the snow in the mountains, I can\u2019t risk getting stuck here.\u201d Octavia travels by train for 12 hours to visit her daughter-in-law, Angela. She visits her as often as she can get the train ticket money together. Her son can\u2019t make it out to see his wife right now she says, but seems hesitant to go into details. Here, no one presses anyone for anything they don\u2019t want to share. There is an unspoken understanding: no one expected to be in this situation, but here they are. This is certainly not how Octavia thought she would spend her retirement; she had planned on buying an RV and joining tours of the Grand Canyon and the Rocky Mountains, but instead she is putting money into her daughter-in-law\u2019s commissary account and traveling to a town in West Virginia she\u2019d never heard of before. The front door bangs open and a woman with shiny blonde hair and bedazzled jeans joins us at the buffet table. This is Barbara, from coastal Virginia. She is quick to smile but her blue eyes hold pain. She comes to visit her daughter, Brandy, whenever she can get a weekend off from her home health nursing job, and whenever her back pain lets up enough for her to drive. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting acupuncture, which really helps,\u201d she says. \u201cBut man, that stuff\u2019s expensive and what with the money I gotta give Brandy for her commissary \u2026 sometimes it\u2019s between that and having the gas money to come visit. Did you know they don\u2019t even give \u2019em shampoo and conditioner? Just this powdered detergent shit, excuse my language. If you want shampoo, you gotta buy it.\u201d Octavia nods in agreement. \u201cYou can spend $250 a month easy, just helping them get the littlest necessities.\u201d \u201cI knew I had to come this weekend though,\u201d Barbara says. \u201cIt\u2019d been three months since I seen my baby.\u201d She has a habit of pushing her fingers into the inside corners of her eyes when she talks about emotional things. \u201cI was so glad there was space for me here at the House. The first couple times I came up to visit Brandy, I\u2019d go over to the River Rest motel after visits, lock myself in that room and cry all night.\u201d \u201cPlus, here you know everybody understands,\u201d says Octavia. \u201cHere we\u2019re all one big family!\u201d a voice booms. We look up to see Chris walk in carrying a grocery store cake with pink icing. \u201cYou know,\u201d Kathleen says, tipping her head towards me as she carries a steaming pot of spaghetti to the sink, \u201cthis place really is family to Mesha. She wouldn\u2019t exist without it.\u201d \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cHer parents met here.\u201d And it\u2019s true. I wouldn\u2019t exist if Sara Jane Moore hadn\u2019t escaped from the prison in 1979. Moore was serving a life sentence for attempting to assassinate Gerald Ford and on 5 February, she scaled the chainlink fence and walked to the Hospitality House, where she told one of the volunteers that her car had broken down in the snow and she desperately needed a ride to the bus station in the next town. It was not until after he had already transported Moore that David Shelton Ross realized who she was. He called the police immediately but that was not enough to assuage suspicion against the house workers. The following summer, when Moore was prosecuted for her escape, all of the Hospitality House workers were mandated to the trial and there was no one left to run the House. The founders, Dick Dieter and Maggie Louden, put the word out to various social justice organizations and a man named Sam Maren answered the call. My father was 23 when he agreed to take the job. He had been on the road, up in DC protesting the closure of a homeless shelter and then down in Florida picking oranges, and thought he\u2019d take a break to help out. On the days when he wasn\u2019t busy cooking for the guests, he practiced his saxophone on the balcony and happened to catch the eye of a woman living in an apartment across the street. I was born five years later. Back in the kitchen, Kathleen rings the dinner bell and guests wrap around the room in a single file line. \u201cSometimes this reminds me of our ladies, lining up for chow,\u201d one man says quietly. \u201cExcept for this food is real good.\u201d I think about how that phrase \u2013 \u201cour ladies\u201d \u2013 acknowledges the sadness in each and every guest. It amazes me sometimes how few words are necessary to unite the guests here, despite the obvious differences in race, class, and political leanings. Reflecting on this, Brian DeRouen said, \u201cIn normal life, we don\u2019t sit down regularly and talk with people that we disagree with, but here at The House, folks do. They not only interact, they share meals. In normal life, half of them would be at Arby\u2019s and the other half at some fancy restaurant, but here they are together. The fact of having someone they love at the camp is really equalizing. No matter how big the differences, the commonality is bigger.\u201d DeRouen recalled a moment when Democratic US Representative John Conyers was visiting his wife, Monica, who was serving time for conspiring to commit bribery, and after dinner a group of guests were sitting in the living room watching the news. The coverage was of the Democratic National Convention and the majority of the guests in the living room were criticizing the Democratic party, using very vulgar language, when suddenly Conyers himself appeared on the screen. Everyone in the room did a double take and then looked over at Conyers where he sat at the end of the sofa. He had told the other guests that he was from Detroit but he had not mentioned what he did there. The other guests rushed to apologize for the way they had been talking but he just laughed and shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t get very far as a politician if you don\u2019t have thick skin,\u201d he said. The result was a lively, but very respectful, political conversation that lasted until 2am. DeRouen points out that people\u2019s voting tendencies don\u2019t necessarily change after interactions like that, but it does become more obvious to everyone how surface level the supposedly big differences between people are in comparison to the depths of the human experience. \u201c\u2026 that bimbo in the White House,\u201d someone behind me says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to offend, but \u2026\u201d \u201cYou know, I really wish I hadn\u2019t voted for him,\u201d Barbara says. \u201cIt seemed like the right thing to do at the time but the more he keeps talking and tweeting, the more I think he might not be telling us the truth.\u201d There are a few groans from others in line, a little awkward silence. \u201cOh, hey,\u201d Chris calls from the end of the counter. \u201cThere\u2019s cake over there, too, for everybody. It\u2019s my wife\u2019s birthday! The girls up at the camp are making her something special in the unit tonight, something like cheesecake they know how to make with Sprite and nondairy creamers and strawberry jelly. Anyways, I told her since I can\u2019t bring her a cake to the visiting room that we\u2019d celebrate here.\u201d \u201cWell, happy birthday! Do we have a date yet?\u201d Kathleen asks. By \u201cdate\u201d she means a scheduled release date for Chris\u2019s wife, and with the \u201cwe\u201d she manages to draw us all in. \u201cYeah!\u201d Chris says. \u201cFebruary 23rd.\u201d A cheer goes up across the room. Chris\u2019s face is glowing, but a moment later his eyes wrinkle with worry. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good thing she\u2019s getting out of there now too,\u201d he says to no one in particular. \u201cIt\u2019s changed a lot in there, they\u2019re bringing in all kinds of drug criminals now. It used to be white collar crimes but now that\u2019s all changing and there are women from MS-13 in there.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s MS-13?\u201d Kathleen asks. \u201cA gang,\u201d Chris says, \u201clike the Mexican mafia.\u201d (I don\u2019t tell him the gang originated in Los Angeles). \u201cAnd there\u2019s no fence up there so there\u2019s all sorts of stuff coming in, just getting brought in by the gang girls. There\u2019s a lot more strip searches going on now because they keep finding so much stuff in there. That\u2019s what\u2019s so awful for my Nancy, she messes up on some bookkeeping paperwork and next thing you know she\u2019s in prison being stripped naked and searched for drugs. They ought have a different prison for women like Nancy \u2013 and a different word, like something that says you broke the law, okay, yes, but you\u2019re not, like, a drug criminal.\u201d An unease settles over the line as Chris keeps talking. When he takes his plate to a table and sits down, Barbara turns to me. \u201cThat\u2019s a bunch of horseshit,\u201d she whispers. \u201cSorry, excuse me, but if there\u2019s anybody you ought to feel sorry for above the others, it\u2019s the girls with drug charges, like my Brandy. She\u2019s one of the only one\u2019s up there for drugs and so everybody just, you know, looks at her weird.\u201d Octavia, Barbara and I fill our plates and sit at a table together, but Barbara just picks at her food. \u201cThey act like she murdered the guy. My Brandy,\u201d Barbara shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t even see how it happened. I mean one minute she was in tech school, getting good grades and she was modeling, beautiful girl, and then she\u2019s hooked on this stuff. And then she\u2019s selling. She helped sell to a doctor\u2019s son, that\u2019s how they got her. She went and gave him the heroin and new needles and took the old needles and the hundred dollars and went back to her friend\u2019s car and then the guy went to a party and somebody helped him shoot up and he died and they pinned it on her.\u201d Octavia nods. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, I know it.\u201d We let silence fall over the table for a while. Chris has finished eating and is helping to clear away other people\u2019s plates, completely unaware that he has rankled anyone. This is one of the few times of unease between guests that I\u2019ve ever encountered here and that, I realize now, is rather miraculous, especially in the current political climate. Where else could you find a room with 50 people with so many different backgrounds doing their best to help each other shoulder a common pain? \u201cCake?\u201d Chris approaches with dessert plates in hand. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want any,\u201d Barbara snaps. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m being rude,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this birthday stuff has got me thinking about Jason. That\u2019s my son. His birthday is tomorrow. Well, it woulda been.\u201d Chris hovers at the end of the table, looking truly concerned. \u201cHe passed away?\u201d \u201cThree years ago, now,\u201d she says. \u201cOverdose.\u201d He\u2019d been clean and living with her. That night they had dinner together and Barbara was watching TV. She called down the hall to Jason: did he want the last biscuit? He loved biscuits, she says, and now she still can\u2019t really look at a can of biscuits without crying. Anyhow, he\u2019d come up and got the biscuit and wrapped it in a paper towel and took it back down there with him and then Barbara must have fallen asleep. When she woke up Jo Jo, Jason\u2019s dog, was scratching at Jason\u2019s bedroom door from the inside, sticking his paws out from under the door. Barbara called to Jason to open the door. Jo Jo needs out, she\u2019d said, but he didn\u2019t answer. She tried the door and it was locked and that\u2019s when she freaked out. The Christmas before she had found him unconscious. They had been hanging lights on the tree. She had told him they were crooked and he had taken them all back off, bless his heart, and did it again until she was happy. Then he had gone down the hall and it wasn\u2019t ten minutes later he\u2019d shot up and she found him and had to do CPR and call the ambulance. This was not an unfamiliar situation to Barbara. She broke down the door this time and got in there and there was a needle and spoon and he was out. She tried CPR. If I could just get him breathing again, she said, looking around the table at us, if I could just get him to breathe. It was the most helpless feeling, Jo Jo was there and wouldn\u2019t leave his side and then the other dog came in and was snuffling around, eating biscuit crumbs from the napkin Jason had left on the bed. His daughter was almost five when he died. She looks just like him, Barbara says. She is now six and still not potty-trained, she uses Pull-Ups and sucks a pacifier. She says she thinks the girl needs counseling. Octavia gets up quietly from the table. She goes to the counter and gets two slices of cake and brings them back, slides one in front of Barbara, along with a cup of decaf coffee. \u201cThey got the guy who sold that shit to Jason,\u201d she says. \u201cHe fronted it to him, passed it to him through the bedroom window \u2019cuz Jason knew I would follow him if he went outside. I\u2019d thought my dog would have barked when that man came up but I didn\u2019t hear anything. If I had seen him though, if I\u2019d caught him doing that, handing that shit through the window to my son so he could shoot up and die \u2026 if I\u2019d seen him, I don\u2019t know what I might have done. They got him on some other stuff, but he\u2019s not even serving time, just probation! They didn\u2019t even use Kevin\u2019s case because they said the dealer had to be there at the time of death. That\u2019s not true though because they got Brandy on those same charges and she wasn\u2019t there when that man died. So if those are the rules, then Brandy shouldn\u2019t be in prison!\u201d Barbara looks up at me, and she is drowning. She is right there in the thick of it, the quandary that is the reason that punitive justice can never really work. Justice: the quality of being fair and reasonable. The retribution you crave for your dead son\u2019s dealer is meted out on your own daughter who was the dealer to someone else\u2019s now dead son. What could possibly be a fair and reasonable punishment for everyone? I think of the \u201cmy\u201d that everyone here uses in front of their loved one\u2019s name: my Nancy, my Brandy, my Angela. And then the \u201cour\u201d and the \u201cwe\u201d that Kathleen and others invoked. This house, on this end of the criminal justice system, seems to me to be one of the few places where I have ever truly seen the quality of being fair and reasonable on display. Behind me in the hallway, I hear Chris helping a new guest fill out her federal paperwork so that her visit can go smoothly in the morning. In the living room, a near-stranger is translating Spanish between a New York mother and her son-in-law. In this house, it is impossible to ignore that everyone is someone\u2019s \u201cmy\u201d and this is perhaps what makes us truly \u201cwe\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Thirty-eight days ago Borja Bast\u00f3n replaced Oli McBurnie in the final throes of Swansea\u2019s third pre-season friendly. It was there at St James Park in Exeter where the Spaniard\u2019s improbable resurrection began in earnest, with his return to the first-team fold after an 805-day hiatus paving the way for an extraordinary rebirth that has led to the striker firing Swansea to second in the Championship and topping the goalscoring charts, with five goals in five games. In weeks Borja has gone from a lesser-spotted misfit to something of an undroppable force.</p> <p>A \u00a315.5m club-record signing three years ago, Borja proved a poster boy for the wrong reasons, a footnote of Swansea\u2019s sorry decline after one goal from 20 top-flight matches en route to relegation. When Borja struck on the opening day this season, it was his first Swansea goal for 1,022 days, only his fifth league start and his first 90 minutes for the club since November 2016, when Bob Bradley was in charge.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/27/bury-historic-club-football-league-financial-ruins\">Series of grinding failures that left proud, historic Bury in ruins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The numbers provide some perspective for a player afforded a second chance under Steve Cooper, who is yet to taste defeat as Swansea\u2019s head coach. The club have made their best start to a league campaign for 41 years and have a tasty clash at the leaders, Leeds United, on Saturday to follow Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup tie at home to Cambridge. Swansea\u2019s home form has been particularly irresistible; only Manchester City have won at the Liberty Stadium since Boxing Day.</p> <p>Borja\u2019s renaissance was envisaged by few fans, with the forward \u2013 who spent the past two seasons on loan in La Liga \u2013 explicitly for sale this summer and absent from the 24-man squad that travelled to Andaluc\u00eda in pre-season, when he stayed at home to train with the under-23s. \u201cHe has been a bit \u2018out of sight, out of mind\u2019 in the last couple of years and he didn\u2019t really do anything in Spain to grab the attention,\u201d says Steve Carroll, the editor of the Swansea Oh Swansea fanzine. \u201cNo one really expected him to come back and what he has done has been a big surprise.

      "bodyText": "Thirty-eight days ago Borja Bast\u00f3n replaced Oli McBurnie in the final throes of Swansea\u2019s third pre-season friendly. It was there at St James Park in Exeter where the Spaniard\u2019s improbable resurrection began in earnest, with his return to the first-team fold after an 805-day hiatus paving the way for an extraordinary rebirth that has led to the striker firing Swansea to second in the Championship and topping the goalscoring charts, with five goals in five games. In weeks Borja has gone from a lesser-spotted misfit to something of an undroppable force. A \u00a315.5m club-record signing three years ago, Borja proved a poster boy for the wrong reasons, a footnote of Swansea\u2019s sorry decline after one goal from 20 top-flight matches en route to relegation. When Borja struck on the opening day this season, it was his first Swansea goal for 1,022 days, only his fifth league start and his first 90 minutes for the club since November 2016, when Bob Bradley was in charge. The numbers provide some perspective for a player afforded a second chance under Steve Cooper, who is yet to taste defeat as Swansea\u2019s head coach. The club have made their best start to a league campaign for 41 years and have a tasty clash at the leaders, Leeds United, on Saturday to follow Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup tie at home to Cambridge. Swansea\u2019s home form has been particularly irresistible; only Manchester City have won at the Liberty Stadium since Boxing Day. Borja\u2019s renaissance was envisaged by few fans, with the forward \u2013 who spent the past two seasons on loan in La Liga \u2013 explicitly for sale this summer and absent from the 24-man squad that travelled to Andaluc\u00eda in pre-season, when he stayed at home to train with the under-23s. \u201cHe has been a bit \u2018out of sight, out of mind\u2019 in the last couple of years and he didn\u2019t really do anything in Spain to grab the attention,\u201d says Steve Carroll, the editor of the Swansea Oh Swansea fanzine. \u201cNo one really expected him to come back and what he has done has been a big surprise. There was always a belief that he had that ability but you just didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever see it at Swansea.\u201d When McBurnie, Swansea\u2019s talisman, was sold on the eve of the season, Borja was handed the No 9 shirt. Borja is in the final year of his contract but together with Andr\u00e9 Ayew \u2013 the club\u2019s highest-earner and also made available by the chairman, Trevor Birch, during another summer of upheaval \u2013 \u00a333.5m-worth of talent is determined not to go quietly. Jefferson Montero and Jordan Ayew have been offloaded and it is not impossible Borja or Andr\u00e9 Ayew \u2013 or both \u2013 will depart before the European deadline on Monday, though the sales of McBurnie to Sheffield United and Daniel James, who came within minutes of signing for Leeds in January, to Manchester United have given Swansea, who expect the pair to stay, some financial leeway. \u201cWe had been desperately hoping that somebody would come in and take them off our hands; now we\u2019re looking at it and thinking: \u2018What happens if we do let them go and if we lose them?\u2019\u201d says Nigel Davies, the editor of the fanzine A Touch Far Vetched. Borja\u2019s transformation has been particularly costly for Davies, who, along with fellow season-ticket holder Aaron O\u2019Shea, has pledged to donate \u00a31 for every Championship point and goal Swansea score this season to the local Samaritans branch. \u201cEvery time Borja scores now, there is a bit of a cheer and then it\u2019s: \u2018That\u2019s another quid gone but, if he can hold off on the hat-trick until my next payday, I\u2019d appreciate it,\u201d Davies says, laughing. \u201cIt will help them with some of their training costs, which in turn may save someone\u2019s life.\u201d Cooper, a former academy manager at Liverpool who won the Under-17 World Cup with England two years ago, has continued where Graham Potter left off, handing a core of young players responsibility and opportunity to thrive, with the Jamaica-born winger Jordon Garrick the latest youngster to follow a path from the under-23s to the first team, in the manner of James, Connor Roberts and Joe Rodon.

In the morning there would be \u2013 distressingly \u2013 flecks of blood staining the wood of my bed frame, on the sheets (particularly around the neck area, and the ankle area) and pillowcases. Later I became more practised at spotting the bedbugs. I don\u2019t think I ever really deeply slept in that time. I was working at the Sydney Morning Herald and spent a summer wearing long-sleeve, dark-coloured turtlenecks to hide my sores and any random bleeding. At night, I would lie there unable to relax, anticipating when they would start feeding off me. The minute I felt the first sharp, tiny nibble \u2013 I would switch the light on. \u201cGotcha!\u201d I would say \u2013 before trying to crush them to death between my thumb and forefinger. They would make a little crunch sound when I killed them. The bugs themselves were tiny \u2013 and, unlike mosquitoes, noiseless. They were a browny-black and looked like disc-shaped ear studs. They had small legs. When I caught and squashed them at night, they oozed blood. My blood, I suppose. They were disgusting. I took to washing my sheets in bleach. In the mornings we would emerge hollow-eyed and itchy from our respective bedrooms, each comparing the fresh hell of the night before. In a way our infestation was a lonely time. None of our friends had bedbugs. We couldn\u2019t joke or laugh or share experiences about the blood on our furniture and our cluster of sores. Nor could we entertain or have dinner parties. What if we infected our friends? It was never stated but I\u2019m sure my flatmate and I both wondered: had the other brought this pestilence into the house? But we worked in offices. We had spent the whole year barely leaving the city. The furthest I had been all year was to cover a murder in Minto. After much back and forth, blaming various visitors (\u201cWas it Barry \u2013 you know that guy who came here and had just been in South America?\u201d) \u2013 we lighted on a suspect. It was our couch that a backpacker had slept on! It had to be it. A pest control guy confirmed the couch was probably Patient Zero. As for the backpacker \u2013 it went without saying that he was the obvious carrier. The pest control guy sprayed everywhere but still the bugs would not die. The next pest controller advised us to throw everything out in the flat that was made of wood \u2013 which turned out to be most of the furniture. I can\u2019t remember who left the flat first \u2013 us or the bedbugs. I never had them since, but remain haunted by the memory.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI wonder if we are stuck in bad movie plots we make ourselves,\u201d says Magsalin, the character at the centre of Gina Apostol\u2019s thrillingly imagined and provocative inquiry into the nature of stories and the unfolding of history in our collective consciousness. The remark is made in one of many terse conversations she has with an American film-maker, Chiara Brasi, who has come to the Philippines to shoot a movie based on her father\u2019s experience in the 1970s of making a film about a notorious massacre of 1901.</p> <p>Magsalin reads Chiara\u2019s script and objects not just to the accuracy of certain details and the viewpoints it adopts, but to the very motivation behind it. A Filipina translator and mystery writer on her first visit to her home country after many years in New York, she decides to put things right by writing her own script. In this jostle for primacy, narrative strands collide, history doubles back on itself, characters real and imagined merge into one version of events, only to be pulled apart again by Magsalin\u2019s constant interrogation of Chiara\u2019s \u2013 and her own \u2013 understanding of the history of the Philippines.</p> <p>As we follow the two women\u2019s competing ideas on how and why we retell history, the question of whose version should take precedence gives way to a meditation on whether that story \u2013 or indeed any other \u2013 can make any real difference to our lives.</p> <p>At the heart of the novel lies the massacre of 30,000 Filipinos by American troops in Balangiga, in retaliation for the killing of 30 American soldiers in an uprising of nationalists (the notion of \u201cinsurrection\u201d and the negative connotations of being an <em>insurrecto</em> as opposed to a freedom fighter is just one thing Magsalin objects to in Chiara\u2019s script). One of these so-called <em>insurrectos</em> is the real life figure Casiana Nasionales, who becomes the protagonist in Magsalin\u2019s script; the fictional Cassandra Chase, an American who photographed the bodies of the murdered Filipinos, figures prominently in Chiara\u2019s version. Who is the true protagonist? Which of the writers has the stronger claim to historical and cultural authenticity?</p> <p>To some extent the novel is tackling the issue of cultural appropriation, but it never ventures close to anything like a crass attempt at resolution, instead using the complexity of its narrative and thematic structure to hint at the difficulty in understanding the confluence of history, power and the individual. None of it is designed to be easy for the reader, and the organisation of the novel constantly gives the impression of being in search of something that lies just beyond the grasp of total comprehension. \u201cAn abaca weave, a warp and weft of numbers, is measured but invisible in the plot. Chapter numbers double up. Puzzle pieces scramble. Points of view will multiply. Allusions, ditto.\u201d In describing her film script, Magsalin is also describing the novel we are reading \u2013 a conscious articulation of the way Apostol is trying to reconfigure how we think of the historical novel.</p> <p><em>Insurrecto</em>\u2019s concern lies chiefly with the women\u2019s motivations behind the telling of these stories rather than the detail or plotlines of the actual narratives. \u201cThe story Magsalin wishes to tell is about loss,\u201d we are told quite plainly, and in this telling, \u201cAny emblem will do\u201d. But through the snippets of her experience, artfully yet movingly distributed through the novel, we learn more than enough to figure out that Magsalin\u2019s motivations are not just political. \u201cA poor and underfed student from the provinces,\u201d Magsalin\u2019s departure from her home country is expressed as an act of freedom, but her prolonged separation from the Philippines creates an anxiety within her that proves difficult to explain. Why was she unable to return, even when her mother was dying? Several times she recalls her mother\u2019s last phone call. \u201cDo not come home \u2026 I understand,\u201d her mother says, but like Magsalin herself, we don\u2019t fully comprehend the reasons for her staying away, and the novel\u2019s energies hint at a deep-seated need to strip away the layers of the exile\u2019s relationship with home and family.</p> <p>Loss and the inability fully to grasp what it means, or how grief can be healed, similarly lie behind Chiara\u2019s movie project. She is haunted by the messiness of her parents\u2019 marriage and the death of her film-maker father when she was very young. She can\u2019t decide how her own movie will remember him: she wants to resurrect him but in the end, he still dies.</p> <p>In the disconnect between the aloof, designer-clad Chiara of today and the vivid portrayals of her as a child in the 70s that we gain through her mother Virginie\u2019s eyes, Apostol reveals a lifetime of pain and estrangement that ultimately mirrors Magsalin\u2019s.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Tash Aw\u2019s We, the Survivors is published by 4th Estate.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI wonder if we are stuck in bad movie plots we make ourselves,\u201d says Magsalin, the character at the centre of Gina Apostol\u2019s thrillingly imagined and provocative inquiry into the nature of stories and the unfolding of history in our collective consciousness. The remark is made in one of many terse conversations she has with an American film-maker, Chiara Brasi, who has come to the Philippines to shoot a movie based on her father\u2019s experience in the 1970s of making a film about a notorious massacre of 1901. Magsalin reads Chiara\u2019s script and objects not just to the accuracy of certain details and the viewpoints it adopts, but to the very motivation behind it. A Filipina translator and mystery writer on her first visit to her home country after many years in New York, she decides to put things right by writing her own script. In this jostle for primacy, narrative strands collide, history doubles back on itself, characters real and imagined merge into one version of events, only to be pulled apart again by Magsalin\u2019s constant interrogation of Chiara\u2019s \u2013 and her own \u2013 understanding of the history of the Philippines. As we follow the two women\u2019s competing ideas on how and why we retell history, the question of whose version should take precedence gives way to a meditation on whether that story \u2013 or indeed any other \u2013 can make any real difference to our lives. At the heart of the novel lies the massacre of 30,000 Filipinos by American troops in Balangiga, in retaliation for the killing of 30 American soldiers in an uprising of nationalists (the notion of \u201cinsurrection\u201d and the negative connotations of being an insurrecto as opposed to a freedom fighter is just one thing Magsalin objects to in Chiara\u2019s script). One of these so-called insurrectos is the real life figure Casiana Nasionales, who becomes the protagonist in Magsalin\u2019s script; the fictional Cassandra Chase, an American who photographed the bodies of the murdered Filipinos, figures prominently in Chiara\u2019s version. Who is the true protagonist? Which of the writers has the stronger claim to historical and cultural authenticity? To some extent the novel is tackling the issue of cultural appropriation, but it never ventures close to anything like a crass attempt at resolution, instead using the complexity of its narrative and thematic structure to hint at the difficulty in understanding the confluence of history, power and the individual. None of it is designed to be easy for the reader, and the organisation of the novel constantly gives the impression of being in search of something that lies just beyond the grasp of total comprehension. \u201cAn abaca weave, a warp and weft of numbers, is measured but invisible in the plot. Chapter numbers double up. Puzzle pieces scramble. Points of view will multiply. Allusions, ditto.\u201d In describing her film script, Magsalin is also describing the novel we are reading \u2013 a conscious articulation of the way Apostol is trying to reconfigure how we think of the historical novel. Insurrecto\u2019s concern lies chiefly with the women\u2019s motivations behind the telling of these stories rather than the detail or plotlines of the actual narratives. \u201cThe story Magsalin wishes to tell is about loss,\u201d we are told quite plainly, and in this telling, \u201cAny emblem will do\u201d. But through the snippets of her experience, artfully yet movingly distributed through the novel, we learn more than enough to figure out that Magsalin\u2019s motivations are not just political. \u201cA poor and underfed student from the provinces,\u201d Magsalin\u2019s departure from her home country is expressed as an act of freedom, but her prolonged separation from the Philippines creates an anxiety within her that proves difficult to explain. Why was she unable to return, even when her mother was dying? Several times she recalls her mother\u2019s last phone call. \u201cDo not come home \u2026 I understand,\u201d her mother says, but like Magsalin herself, we don\u2019t fully comprehend the reasons for her staying away, and the novel\u2019s energies hint at a deep-seated need to strip away the layers of the exile\u2019s relationship with home and family. Loss and the inability fully to grasp what it means, or how grief can be healed, similarly lie behind Chiara\u2019s movie project. She is haunted by the messiness of her parents\u2019 marriage and the death of her film-maker father when she was very young. She can\u2019t decide how her own movie will remember him: she wants to resurrect him but in the end, he still dies. In the disconnect between the aloof, designer-clad Chiara of today and the vivid portrayals of her as a child in the 70s that we gain through her mother Virginie\u2019s eyes, Apostol reveals a lifetime of pain and estrangement that ultimately mirrors Magsalin\u2019s. \u2022 Tash Aw\u2019s We, the Survivors is published by 4th Estate.

Virginia Giuffre had already alleged in 2011 testimony that Andrew \u201cknows the truth\u201d about Epstein\u2019s abuse of underage girls and said he should be made to testify. In a December 2014 court filing she alleged that she was made to have sex with Andrew and other friends of Epstein. The prince has always vehemently denied the allegations. In 2015 a court decided that the allegations made by Giuffre about the prince were \u201cimmaterial and impertinent\u201d and ordered them to be struck out of a claim against Epstein. On Tuesday, Giuffre, who now lives in Queensland with her Australian husband, spoke to reporters outside federal court in Manhattan. She was one of nearly two dozen women who spoke about alleged sexual abuse by Epstein during a unique court proceeding scheduled after the financier\u2019s death in prison on 10 August, which was ruled a suicide. Epstein\u2019s death at 66 brought an end to his criminal case but the judge gave accusers the opportunity to speak publicly. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s done and he can attest to that,\u201d Giuffre said about Prince Andrew, a video of the press conference showed. \u201cHe knows exactly what he\u2019s done, and I hope he comes clean about it.\u201d Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing a number of Epstein accusers, said that \u201cwith respect to Prince Andrew or anyone else who made statements, gratuitous statements, if anyone wants to come over here and talk with us, and answer real questions that the victims have, and that we have on their behalf, we welcome that invitation. \u201cI personally extended that invitation to Prince Andrew multiple times.

I just didn\u2019t think she was in complete control.\u201d Both he and the V/Line conductor, Shaun Irvine, said they had acted out of concern for Day\u2019s safety. Thomas told Fitzgerald he had used his powers of arrest to compel Day to leave the train, saying she was being arrested for being drunk in a public place. But he added that he had not communicated that to her. Later, his partner constable Aaron Towns said that the word \u201carrest\u201d was never said out loud between any of the police in attendance. \u201cIt was probably the most low-key arrest I have ever done,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI didn\u2019t formally say you are under arrest, I just expressed that I wanted her to come with me, and I guess by compelling her to come with me, that\u2019s a form of arrest.\u201d Thomas said Day\u2019s demeanour had improved after they left the train and spoke on the platform and, at that point, he formed the view that neither an ambulance nor any other medical assistance were required. He said he had been performing an \u201congoing\u201d mental assessment of the health and welfare risks, as per the police medical checklist. The checklist, contained in the police manual, sets out the requirements for dealing with intoxicated persons. If an intoxicated person is unable to provide intelligible responses, Fitzgerald read from the guide, police should \u201csend to hospital or seek urgent medical advice\u201d. Thomas dismissed a suggestion that, according to that checklist, he should have taken Day to hospital, because of her improvement on the platform. He said it had never been his intention that Day would be taken into custody and he had hoped a friend or family member could be found to collect her, but they were unable to arrange that before they left the station. He didn\u2019t think Day was so drunk that it posed a health risk. The inquest has heard that Day\u2019s blood alcohol level was estimated to be 0.30, six times the legal limit for driving. Towns rated her level of intoxication as 7.5 out of 10. Immediately after he and Thomas left the train station, they went to a hotel to pick up a woman Towns described in contemporaneous notes as \u201chighly intoxicated.\u201d They did not arrest her or issue an infringement for public drunkenness but instead left her to wait in the hotel for a period, before driving her home. Towns said the circumstances in that case were different. Day died in St Vincent\u2019s hospital on 22 December from a brain haemorrhage caused by falling in the Castlemaine police cells, where she was held for four hours to \u201csober up\u201d. The inquest continues.",

I was like, \u2018Oh God, I have had all those years feeling like this \u2013 why isn\u2019t it talked about?\u2019\u201d Making sure the menopause is talked about has become one of Matthew\u2019s driving forces. In 2017, she started a blog about the menopause. It features articles and Q&amp;As from menopause specialists, real-life experiences \u2013 including her own \u2013 and lists of products Mathews says have helped her. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in helping the 3% of women who can afford to go to Harley Street and buy expensive supplements,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to help women fill their weekly shopping basket with genuinely affordable products that will really help them.\u201d The blog has been a runaway success, with a million visitors in its first six months. \u201cI\u2019ve held two conferences in London with a range of the country\u2019s best specialists talking on a wide range of topics. For the second one, in May this year, the tickets sold out,\u201d she says. Mathews has given talks in unlikely places, including at the Foreign Office\u2019s services division: \u201cThey opened the phone lines to every embassy and Commonwealth office around the world so that they could listen in, too,\u201d she says. \u201cIt went so well that they invited me back to their main office in Milton Keynes to talk to their employees there.\u201d She has spoken at the British Library and the BBC, and is in discussions to speak at another government department. This, says Mathews, is just the start. \u201cI want to take my conferences nationwide,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to help women create a sisterhood network, like Weight Watchers, where they meet weekly in a village hall-type setting to discuss their symptoms and swap advice because many women don\u2019t have anyone to talk to \u2013 we\u2019re in a bubble in London. I have learned everything just through my network of women.\u201d Mathews plans to lobby the government for trained nurse practitioners to act as the first port of call for women experiencing menopausal symptoms \u2013 and to persuade writers of soaps to include a menopause storyline. \u201cThere have been storylines about paedophiles, rape, murders and drug addiction, LGBT issues \u2013 but they have never had Bet Lynch behind the bar having a hot sweat,\u201d she says. \u201cSoaps play a pivotal role in helping to start conversations within families on a national scale. So many women probably don\u2019t know how to explain to their husbands what\u2019s going on. But if it was on a TV show as a storyline, it\u2019d be \u2018look at what\u2019s going on in EastEnders, she\u2019s got the menopause!\u2019\u201d",

In November 2018, she fell and broke three ribs. When she had a CT scan for that injury, it was discovered that there was cancer on her lungs. She had surgery and went back to work.

It has something to do, too, with the content of her career and her public statements, in which she has advocated strongly for women\u2019s place in public life and for their full and equal citizenship. Before the court, in her career as a lawyer, legal academic, and activist, she worked to extend the 14th amendment and the Civil Rights Act to women; she was founder of the ACLU\u2019s women\u2019s rights project and an ardent opponent of laws that sought to treat women as lesser than men.

This has been the central belief of her career, a belief that is less popular and more heatedly endangered than it once was: that women are subjects of American democracy just as men are, and that they should be as free as men are. \u201cI\u2019m sometimes asked when there will be enough,\u201d she once said, referring to a question she gets with some frequency about the number of women on the supreme court (there are currently three). \u201cAnd I say, \u2018When there are nine.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>On the symbolic level, the drama of her fight to remain on the bench is the drama of women in American democracy.

Meanwhile, the 2005 case Castle Rock v Gonzales ruled that women have no affirmative right to protection from domestic violence from the police, not even if they have a restraining order against their abusive partner \u2013 a case that some legal scholars argue effectively ended the extension of the 14th amendment\u2019s equal protection clause to women.

      "bodyText": "Any snooty film critic worth their weight in pretentious non-fiction books has, at some point, uttered a variation of the following line: \u201cPut your phone down and watch the damn movie!\u201d While television is a different beast \u2013 particularly with the rise of contemporary habits such as second-screening \u2013 it remains virtually unheard of for someone to say: \u201cPick up your phone to watch this, because it\u2019s been designed especially for it.\u201d That is precisely the case, however, with ABC\u2019s seven-part narrative series Content, which will not be beaming into a TV set near you. Instead, it will be available from 4 September exclusively on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and iView, designed to watch on that same device you\u2019re told to turn off at the cinema. \u201cThe premise was: how do you take a conventional movie structure and put it on a phone? Then we developed it from there,\u201d says executive producer for the ABC, Que Minh Luu. The show is a comedy about a narcissistic millennial determined to become an online influencer, no matter what it takes \u2013 from keeping the camera rolling during a literal car crash (prescient, it turns out), to performing her first \u201cmukbang\u201d. The high concept is that it unfolds in real time, entirely from the perspective of the protagonist\u2019s smartphone. We not only see the social media posts, video calls and various online exploits of young Brisbane woman Lucy (Charlotte Nicdao), but also every action she performs on her smartphone, including backspaces and things she deletes. This enables the film-makers to put an interesting spin on the old \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d dictum, providing a digital window into Lucy\u2019s mind. Watching Content feels like eavesdropping on somebody else\u2019s private communication \u2013 or observing a phone that\u2019s suddenly become possessed. Presented in a portrait ratio that takes up the entirety of the viewer\u2019s smartphone, Content has been billed as \u201cAustralia\u2019s first ever vertical video series\u201d. It belongs to a small genre of narrative productions told entirely through screens, such as the feature film thrillers Searching and Unfriended, which unfold via laptop and smartphones. Co-director Daley Pearson, who executive-produced the smash-hit animated kids show Bluey, attributes part of his inspiration for Content to the realisation that \u201cif I was to die and whatever god there was gave me stats on my life, I\u2019m pretty sure I would be shocked to find out how much of the relationships with people I love the most were lived through phones\u201d. As we watch Lucy unlock her home screen, load Spotify, check her messages, pose for selfies, neglect her best friend Daisy (Gemma Bird Matheson) and load apps such as Tinder and Facebook, the show unfolds with a seemingly effortless quality. In reality, most of Content was animated (Luu estimates around 80%) rather than taken from screen captures of an actual phone. It required a different kind of writing. The question \u201cwhat happens next?\u201d is a common one in the construction of narratives. However, in this instance, the plot was written and developed in tiny increments, capturing the small but dramatically meaningful actions Lucy performs through her phone.

Everything was created.\u201d To research how audiences would react to the show, focus group test screenings were held during which the film-makers observed viewers through two-way mirrors. \u201cWe had explained the concept to them, but most people were quite flummoxed until they actually saw it in front of their own eyes,\u201d recounts Luu. \u201cWhat we got out of those sessions was that people understood the format.

She said she wouldn\u2019t have known who Huang was. \u201cI don\u2019t think I actually saw the Aldi bag,\u201d Murnain said. \u201cBut I honestly just don\u2019t remember that.\u201d Murnain agreed it would be \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d for $100,000 cash to be given to NSW Labor at any one point, but said she could not recall when she first became aware of the substantial donation. \u201cI just don\u2019t remember at what point I became aware, it was so long ago.\u201d The chief commissioner, Peter Hall, indicated he would be calling Cheah back to give evidence in the wake of Murnain\u2019s appearance, likely on Thursday. Official Labor records claim the $100,000 came from 20 individual $5,000 donations, made by 12 separate donors at the Chinese Friends of Labor dinner. Earlier on Wednesday, one of those 12 donors, Steve Tong, said he had never given Labor $5,000. He said he had been \u201cdumbfounded\u201d to receive an invoice for the donation. \u201cI was a bit dumbfounded because I thought \u2018When did I donate money to the Labor party?\u2019\u201d Tong said, through an interpreter. Tong worked for Wu International, a property developer he said had \u201cvery close\u201d links to Wong. He later discovered his superiors had made the donation and put his name to it, but said he feared he would be the target of revenge \u201cby some scoundrel\u201d if he spoke out, and was told by his bosses to go along with it. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cHe said if anything happens then the company will hire a lawyer to deal with the matter for you,\u201d Tong said. \u201cI was told that anything you do for the company, you just do it. If anything happens, we will deal with it for you. You just do it.\u201d One of Tong\u2019s bosses, Quanbao \u201cLeo\u201d Liao, killed himself before giving evidence to Icac investigators last year. Tong said he went to Liao, and another of his superiors, Alex Wu, when the NSW Electoral Commission later asked him for records of the donation. He said his superiors helped him fill out documents lying to the electoral commission about the donation. \u201cI was telling lies to the electoral commission and the company told me that if anything happens, they would take care of it for me, so I just followed what they asked me to do,\u201d Tong said. He said he was now deciding to tell the truth to Icac on the advice of his lawyer, his wife, and because he was not a good liar. Tong is now the second of the 12 donors to claim he did not give $5,000 to Labor, despite records suggesting the contrary. To \u201cStanley\u201d Yip, who runs a souvenir store in Haymarket, has told investigators with the NSW Electoral Commission \u2013 which investigated the matter before referring it to Icac \u2013 that he never made the donation. \u201cThe only money I spent on the Labor party was the $500 for a single seat at the table,\u201d he said. \u201cAt no time did [I] donate $5,000. I don\u2019t have that much money to spend on these things.\u201d Further evidence given to Icac suggests it was extremely unlikely that Labor would receive cash donations as large as $5,000 at dinner events. The former NSW Labor fundraising manager, Patty Barrett, who worked for the party between 2009 and 2016, said she had never seen cash donations that large at any point. \u201cDuring my entire employment with the ALP NSW branch, I have never seen or heard of any individual person or company donating $5,000 in cash at any fundraising dinner or event,\u201d Barrett told Icac in a statement. \u201cIf this would have occurred, I definitely would recall it.\u201d She also said it would be \u201chighly unusual\u201d for money raised at a fundraising dinner to be delivered to NSW Labor headquarters a month later. Evidence suggests Huang arrived at Labor\u2019s head office with the $100,000 in April, more than three weeks after the March fundraising dinner. The inquiry continues before chief commissioner Peter Hall. Murnain is continuing to give evidence and Tong will return to give evidence next week.",

But what makes him such a deft public historian is the way he stitches these patches of rich local colour into a narrative with the widest possible reach. Having dealt with the immediate postwar period in two of his previous books, <em>Never Again: Britain 1945\u201351</em> (1992) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/28/featuresreviews.guardianreview10\" title=\"\"><em>Having it so Good: Britain in the Fifties</em></a> (2006), here he picks up his story in 1960, the moment Britain becomes modern. Don\u2019t, though, expect a slack meander through the entire decade, stopping off at the usual staging posts: Profumo, the Pill, Beeching, Mary Quant, blah blah blah. What we have instead is a forensic look at the years from 1960 to 64, what one might call \"the low 60s\", when everyone aged over 35 still wore a hat out of doors and fanned themselves theatrically with a copy of the Daily Herald if the thermometer looked as if it would go over 75F (24C).</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/apr/24/greatspeeches\" title=\"\">Wind of Change</a> was the name given to the speech that Conservative prime minister Harold Macmillan made in Cape Town when he acknowledged in 1960 that Britain could no longer stand in the way of its African colonies\u2019 self-determination. Here, though, Hennessy tweaks and extends the phrase to cover every kind of social, political and economic gust blowing through Britain around the time of Philip Larkin\u2019s \u201cAnnus Mirabilis\u201d of 1963 when, in one of the poem\u2019s lesser known lines, \u201cevery life became \u2026 a quite unlosable game\u201d. Ironic, of course, because exactly the opposite was the case. No sooner had Britain acquired all those new motorways, hospitals, plate-glass universities and sexual freedoms than it became anguishingly clear that \u201cevery life\u201d might be lost in a single afternoon of red-button madness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>All it would have taken for the third world war to break out was for a particularly jittery East German border guard to attempt to halt a western military convoy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, Hennessy is careful not to simply rehash old historical paradigms. Many historians aiming to give a sense of the terror of living in the nuclear age fall back on the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Hennessy, by contrast, lengthens the timescale and adjusts the point of view so that we start to see Britain not merely as a cowed bystander in the global arms race but as an active agent in its own nightmare. From the moment in 1957 when the RAF\u2019s V force reached full operational strength, we effectively had radioactive skin in the game. Similarly, Hennessy shifts the likely flashpoint from Cuba to Berlin. Forget about Soviet gunboats chugging through the Caribbean. All it would have taken for the third world war to break out was for a particularly jittery East German border guard to attempt to halt a western military convoy somewhere along the autobahn leading from the free world to the partitioned city.</p> <p>It is entirely characteristic of Hennessy to leave space in this seismic account for the free play of individual quirks. The Soviet leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/apr/26/greatspeeches2\" title=\"\">Nikita Khrushchev</a> emerges as an oaf who could easily have postured his way into a third world war simply because he wanted to send a message to Mao Zedong about who was the biggest, baddest kid in the communist playground. Hennessy presents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1986/dec/30/obituaries\" title=\"\">Harold Macmillan</a> as a wounded war hero from the Somme \u2013 the old man still lived with a piece of Krupp ordnance buried in his thigh \u2013 who could never quite bring himself to trust the Germans since they were, he pointed out privately, the \u201cpeople who have tried to destroy us twice in this century\u201d. All the same, \u201cMac\u201d, the unofficial hero of this book, was prepared to overlook his instincts about \u201cthe Teuton\u201d if it meant advancing his grand design. This was an ambitious plan to position Britain as the hinge between the free world\u2019s two great blocs. On the one hand was the Anglo-American alliance, the historical special relationship that had received such a boost during the recent war and was maintained under Eisenhower and, later Kennedy. On the other was a Europe that was forging itself into a bulwark against communism, and Britain\u2019s relationship with it. Much as Germany still pained Mac literally, it made overwhelming sense for Britain to become fully European. It would take 10 years of hard bargaining, and a lot of undignified pleading with a hostile General de Gaulle, before the country was finally allowed to wave goodbye to Europe\u2019s \u201couter seven\u201d and join the central sextet at the top table. Oh, how badly we wanted it.</p> <p>Such is the length of this book \u2013 nearly 600 pages long \u2013 that it would be easy to slip and slide in the shale of detail. But Hennessy has such a keen associative eye and such a generous heart for the sheer oddness of everything that the narrative spins along like a comfortable chat. There is, for instance, Margaret Thatcher described by Mac in his diary as \u201ca clever young woman MP\u201d. At her first meeting with the great man after her promotion in 1961, she carefully chooses her \u201cbest outfit\u201d in \u201csapphire blue\u201d and announces that she wants to start her new job at the Ministry of Pensions immediately. Taken aback, and perhaps feeling sorry for the civil servants who are about to encounter their terrifying new boss, Mac drawls at her to wait until at least 11am the next morning before turning up at the office and then making a speedy exit \u2013 \u201cI shouldn\u2019t stay too long\u201d. There are other wonderful cameos. Enoch Powell, so clever, so wrong, with a voice like \u201can air raid siren with a Birmingham accent\u201d. And then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/dec/11/highereducation.biography1\" title=\"\">Reginald Maudling</a>, the chancellor of the exchequer who, it transpires, liked to cut political meetings short in order to be in front of the television in time to watch <em>Come Dancing</em>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Winds of Change: Britain in the Early Sixties is published by Allen Lane (\u00a330). </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/winds-of-change-9781846141102.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com</em></a><em> or call 0330 333 6846.

Here, though, Hennessy tweaks and extends the phrase to cover every kind of social, political and economic gust blowing through Britain around the time of Philip Larkin\u2019s \u201cAnnus Mirabilis\u201d of 1963 when, in one of the poem\u2019s lesser known lines, \u201cevery life became \u2026 a quite unlosable game\u201d. Ironic, of course, because exactly the opposite was the case. No sooner had Britain acquired all those new motorways, hospitals, plate-glass universities and sexual freedoms than it became anguishingly clear that \u201cevery life\u201d might be lost in a single afternoon of red-button madness. Still, Hennessy is careful not to simply rehash old historical paradigms. Many historians aiming to give a sense of the terror of living in the nuclear age fall back on the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Hennessy, by contrast, lengthens the timescale and adjusts the point of view so that we start to see Britain not merely as a cowed bystander in the global arms race but as an active agent in its own nightmare. From the moment in 1957 when the RAF\u2019s V force reached full operational strength, we effectively had radioactive skin in the game. Similarly, Hennessy shifts the likely flashpoint from Cuba to Berlin. Forget about Soviet gunboats chugging through the Caribbean. All it would have taken for the third world war to break out was for a particularly jittery East German border guard to attempt to halt a western military convoy somewhere along the autobahn leading from the free world to the partitioned city. It is entirely characteristic of Hennessy to leave space in this seismic account for the free play of individual quirks. The Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev emerges as an oaf who could easily have postured his way into a third world war simply because he wanted to send a message to Mao Zedong about who was the biggest, baddest kid in the communist playground. Hennessy presents Harold Macmillan as a wounded war hero from the Somme \u2013 the old man still lived with a piece of Krupp ordnance buried in his thigh \u2013 who could never quite bring himself to trust the Germans since they were, he pointed out privately, the \u201cpeople who have tried to destroy us twice in this century\u201d. All the same, \u201cMac\u201d, the unofficial hero of this book, was prepared to overlook his instincts about \u201cthe Teuton\u201d if it meant advancing his grand design. This was an ambitious plan to position Britain as the hinge between the free world\u2019s two great blocs. On the one hand was the Anglo-American alliance, the historical special relationship that had received such a boost during the recent war and was maintained under Eisenhower and, later Kennedy. On the other was a Europe that was forging itself into a bulwark against communism, and Britain\u2019s relationship with it. Much as Germany still pained Mac literally, it made overwhelming sense for Britain to become fully European. It would take 10 years of hard bargaining, and a lot of undignified pleading with a hostile General de Gaulle, before the country was finally allowed to wave goodbye to Europe\u2019s \u201couter seven\u201d and join the central sextet at the top table. Oh, how badly we wanted it. Such is the length of this book \u2013 nearly 600 pages long \u2013 that it would be easy to slip and slide in the shale of detail. But Hennessy has such a keen associative eye and such a generous heart for the sheer oddness of everything that the narrative spins along like a comfortable chat. There is, for instance, Margaret Thatcher described by Mac in his diary as \u201ca clever young woman MP\u201d. At her first meeting with the great man after her promotion in 1961, she carefully chooses her \u201cbest outfit\u201d in \u201csapphire blue\u201d and announces that she wants to start her new job at the Ministry of Pensions immediately. Taken aback, and perhaps feeling sorry for the civil servants who are about to encounter their terrifying new boss, Mac drawls at her to wait until at least 11am the next morning before turning up at the office and then making a speedy exit \u2013 \u201cI shouldn\u2019t stay too long\u201d. There are other wonderful cameos. Enoch Powell, so clever, so wrong, with a voice like \u201can air raid siren with a Birmingham accent\u201d. And then there\u2019s Reginald Maudling, the chancellor of the exchequer who, it transpires, liked to cut political meetings short in order to be in front of the television in time to watch Come Dancing. \u2022 Winds of Change: Britain in the Early Sixties is published by Allen Lane (\u00a330).

      "bodyText": "A day that began with optimism ended in despair, disbelief and fury in Bury as one of England\u2019s oldest football clubs was kicked out of the English Football League (EFL) after 125 years. The future of Bury FC was plunged into grave doubt after the 134-year-old club was expelled from the league at 11pm on Tuesday, hours after the collapse of an 11th-hour rescue deal Thirteen miles away, the fate of Bolton Wanderers also looked increasingly perilous as the club was given 14 days to save its membership in a league it helped found in 1888. The process of closing down the club could begin as early as Wednesday. There was widespread shock and demands for reform of football governance when Bury\u2019s dramatic expulsion was announced by the EFL, which described it as \u201cundoubtedly one of the darkest days in the league\u2019s recent history\u201d. It is understood that the EFL rejected late pleas for Bury to be given a 24-hour extension to its deadline, up to 5pm on Wednesday, to thrash out a deal between the owner Steve Dale and two new potential bidders after a sale to the data company C&amp;N Sporting Risk fell through shortly before Tuesday\u2019s deadline. Ivan Lewis, the independent MP for Bury South, said the expulsion was a \u201cdevastating blow to us all\u201d and that securing the club\u2019s future was \u201cnow a massively uphill struggle and to give people false hope would be unfair\u201d. \u201cOn the other hand, we can\u2019t afford to leave any stone unturned and the fight goes on,\u201d he said. Lewis said Dale had agreed in principle to sell the club to a potential owner before 5pm but that the EFL refused to allow more time for a deal to be done: \u201cThat\u2019s one of the issues we want to discuss with the league as a matter of great urgency \u2026 But all options remain open to us \u2013 the fans, the council, the MPs \u2013 and we\u2019re not going to lie down and die.\u201d The Labour MP James Frith said Bury had been \u201cthe victim of a joint enterprise crime\u201d by \u201can inadequate football administrator [and] a toxic and ignorant ownership of the football club \u2013 both current and previous\u201d. Frith, who represents Bury North, said the EFL response to the club\u2019s crisis had been \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d and that reforming the governing body was \u201ctop of the to-do list\u201d. Frith condemned the EFL for giving Bury a deadline extension of one working day to hammer out a deal and insisting that negotiations took place exclusively with C&amp;N Sporting Risk, despite knowing that other credible bidders were interested. \u201cThere is an institutional failure in football governance in this country and that\u2019s what we\u2019re facing now The impact of that is the town of Bury, which has suffered from austerity, 10 years plus of neglect as a town in the shadow of Manchester, that has a great deal to offer, has now lost a force of influence, economic and cultural capital,\u201d he added. Hundreds of volunteers gathered at Bury\u2019s Gigg Lane stadium earlier in the day, scrubbing toilets and cleaning the stands in the hope the club would survive and play its delayed first game of the season on Saturday. Those hopes were dashed when the English Football League announced shortly before 5pm that the late takeover deal had collapsed, as crowds of anxious fans, some in tears, gathered outside the ground. Stephen Farrar, 26, one of hundreds who spent hours cleaning stands in anticipation of Bury\u2019s first game of the season going ahead on Saturday, said: \u201cMy legs are shaking \u2013 I just feel like I\u2019m going to cry to be honest. I know people are saying \u2018still believe\u2019 but I don\u2019t know how it can [survive]. I\u2019m devastated.\u201d The fate of Bury and Bolton, two of the oldest clubs in English football, has fuelled calls for a complete overhaul of the rules and regulations governing the sport in Britain. Outside Gigg Lane, Clive Roberts, 73, said he had travelled 7,000 miles from his home in Canada hoping to watch his beloved club\u2019s first few games of the season \u201conly to find I was attending a wake\u201d. Roberts said his great grandfather watched Bury win the FA Cup in 1903, while his own father played for the RAF team at Gigg Lane during the second world war. \u201cI hoped my own grandchildren would be coming here in years to come \u2013 that\u2019s not going to be the case,\u201d he said. \u201cThe family will lose that link to Bury and lose what the history of the area means. It\u2019s a very emotional day \u2013 I\u2019m trying to hold it in. It maybe hasn\u2019t hit home yet but it will.\u201d Greg Edyvean, 38, has had a season ticket at Gigg Lane since he was six weeks old. He continued the tradition with his own two children, now aged 12 and two. As the news of the deal\u2019s collapse filtered through, Edyvean was allowed to sit alone in his regular seat inside the stadium. \u201cI\u2019ve been sat there for the best part of two hours in tears,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite place on earth and it could be the last time it happens. It\u2019s horrific. There\u2019s not words to describe it.\u201d Some volunteers drove 300 miles to take part in the clean-up operation, with plumbers, bricklayers, electricians all chipping in alongside fans of rival clubs including Leeds United, Accrington Stanley and Blackpool. Carrying her gloves, bucket and sponge, 72-year-old Joan Lingard was cleaning the stadium\u2019s seats by 9am on Tuesday. It would be \u201cabsolutely awful\u201d for Bury if its club disappeared, she said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s come down, whether they come to the matches or not. I\u2019d hate to see it go. Next to Bury black puddings, this is the next thing, Gigg Lane. The two are synonymous.\u201d Ian Frazer, 48, a Leeds fan, joined the clean-up, motivated by the financial crisis experienced by his own club 12 years ago. Wearing a Leeds shirt while scrubbing pigeon droppings off Bury\u2019s Manchester Road stand, Frazer said: \u201cIt\u2019s simple stuff like this that\u2019s fantastic to see \u2013 all the kids here. I kind of welled up when I got here. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very moving in many ways. To see this reaction from Bury supporters, from people who live in the town who maybe aren\u2019t football fans. This is a tremendous outpouring of community spirit. I\u2019ll be honest, out of adversity over the last few weeks and months this town has really shown its strength.\u201d",

The target quotas include 40% in favour of independence and 45% opposed, along with 56% in favour of remaining in the EU and 30% who want to leave. On Holyrood voting intention, the targets are 30% of the membership supporting the SNP, 18% Scottish Conservative and 16% Scottish Labour.</p> <p>The figures, which are a little lower than the current levels of support for the SNP and independence, were arrived at by averaging all polling with samples in Scotland conducted between August 2018 and August 2019.</p> <p>Before the briefing, Martin addressed accusations from the Scottish Conservatives that the assembly was \u201can SNP vanity project\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not naive: it is good for the Scottish government to get an ongoing discussion on the constitution. On the other hand, they are taking a massive risk because the government has no idea what\u2019s going to come out at the end of this process,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The former MEP, who represented Scottish Labour in Brussels for 35 years, said: \u201cI only agreed to take this on because I got the assurance that we would be independent of government.\u201d</p> <p>Some critics suggest that the project has been mishandled from the start. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/24/sturgeon-outlines-new-scottish-independence-referendum-plans\">announced it in April</a> alongside a package of measures to prepare for a second independence referendum, which the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/04/hostility-gone-willie-rennie-scottish-lib-dems-shake-cleggs-legacy-challenge-snp\">Willie Rennie</a>, said made it impossible to have confidence in the assembly.</p> <p>Martin agreed this was a mistake on Sturgeon\u2019s part. But he was critical of threats from the Scottish Tories and Lib Dems to boycott the process, accusing them of \u201cplaying games\u201d.</p> <p>Much of the framework for the assembly draws on the Irish experience of using citizens\u2019 assemblies to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/citizens-assembly-ireland-abortion-referendum\">reach consensus on abortion</a> and same-sex marriage.</p> <p>Professional mediators with no links to political organisations will facilitate each of the six weekend meetings. These will be livestreamed, any documents submitted will be available to the public, and there will be space for the media to observe.</p> <p>The Scottish version will also pay members a \u201cgift\u201d of \u00a3200 a weekend, after organisers in Ireland found that people with caring responsibilities and poorer people dropped out at a higher rate because their involvement became too burdensome financially.</p> <p>At the briefing on Tuesday, Martin confirmed that the publicly available details of participants would be limited to full name and geographical location. He acknowledged that the final membership could include those with criminal records or extreme views: members will be required to sign up to a code of conduct and will be relied upon to confirm there is nothing in their background that could bring the assembly into disrepute.</p> <p>Martin said: \u201cIf you end up with the chattering classes then it has not served its purpose. And you also have to be sure that no matter how articulate people are, their voice is heard equally. That\u2019s the point of the facilitators, to ensure that no one dominates.\u201d</p> <p>Martin wants people to come in with an open mind, call on experts and then draw conclusions from what they hear. Narrowing down the initial question posed by Sturgeon \u2013 what kind of Scotland would we like to live in, how is it affected by Brexit and what are the implications of that? \u2013 he envisages more \u201cmanageable\u201d subjects such as fairness at work and freedom of movement.</p> <p>The Scottish government has committed to producing an action plan within three months of the assembly\u2019s report being put before Holyrood for scrutiny and debate.</p> <p>Martin said he hoped the process would be a healing one, not just for the 120 or so people directly involved but for the wider community as well. It was \u201cvital for democracy\u201d after two highly divisive referendums, Martin said. \u201cIn Scotland and the UK we are now in the position where a lot of people just do not tolerate other people\u2019s points of view.\u201d</p>",

Teams of recruiters expect to knock on thousands of doors across Scotland before October in order to complete what organisers admit is a \u201cchallenging\u201d random selection process, using face-to-face screening interviews to recruit a \u201cmini-public\u201d of about 120 people who reflect a spectrum of the over-16 population in terms of location, age, gender, ethnicity, disability, education and viewpoint. Describing the door-to-door recruitment as \u201cold school\u201d, Wimpress said she hoped the framework set out on Tuesday would undercut assumptions of pro-independence bias. The target quotas include 40% in favour of independence and 45% opposed, along with 56% in favour of remaining in the EU and 30% who want to leave. On Holyrood voting intention, the targets are 30% of the membership supporting the SNP, 18% Scottish Conservative and 16% Scottish Labour. The figures, which are a little lower than the current levels of support for the SNP and independence, were arrived at by averaging all polling with samples in Scotland conducted between August 2018 and August 2019. Before the briefing, Martin addressed accusations from the Scottish Conservatives that the assembly was \u201can SNP vanity project\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not naive: it is good for the Scottish government to get an ongoing discussion on the constitution. On the other hand, they are taking a massive risk because the government has no idea what\u2019s going to come out at the end of this process,\u201d he said. The former MEP, who represented Scottish Labour in Brussels for 35 years, said: \u201cI only agreed to take this on because I got the assurance that we would be independent of government.\u201d Some critics suggest that the project has been mishandled from the start. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced it in April alongside a package of measures to prepare for a second independence referendum, which the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Willie Rennie, said made it impossible to have confidence in the assembly. Martin agreed this was a mistake on Sturgeon\u2019s part. But he was critical of threats from the Scottish Tories and Lib Dems to boycott the process, accusing them of \u201cplaying games\u201d. Much of the framework for the assembly draws on the Irish experience of using citizens\u2019 assemblies to reach consensus on abortion and same-sex marriage. Professional mediators with no links to political organisations will facilitate each of the six weekend meetings. These will be livestreamed, any documents submitted will be available to the public, and there will be space for the media to observe. The Scottish version will also pay members a \u201cgift\u201d of \u00a3200 a weekend, after organisers in Ireland found that people with caring responsibilities and poorer people dropped out at a higher rate because their involvement became too burdensome financially. At the briefing on Tuesday, Martin confirmed that the publicly available details of participants would be limited to full name and geographical location. He acknowledged that the final membership could include those with criminal records or extreme views: members will be required to sign up to a code of conduct and will be relied upon to confirm there is nothing in their background that could bring the assembly into disrepute. Martin said: \u201cIf you end up with the chattering classes then it has not served its purpose. And you also have to be sure that no matter how articulate people are, their voice is heard equally. That\u2019s the point of the facilitators, to ensure that no one dominates.\u201d Martin wants people to come in with an open mind, call on experts and then draw conclusions from what they hear. Narrowing down the initial question posed by Sturgeon \u2013 what kind of Scotland would we like to live in, how is it affected by Brexit and what are the implications of that? \u2013 he envisages more \u201cmanageable\u201d subjects such as fairness at work and freedom of movement. The Scottish government has committed to producing an action plan within three months of the assembly\u2019s report being put before Holyrood for scrutiny and debate. Martin said he hoped the process would be a healing one, not just for the 120 or so people directly involved but for the wider community as well. It was \u201cvital for democracy\u201d after two highly divisive referendums, Martin said. \u201cIn Scotland and the UK we are now in the position where a lot of people just do not tolerate other people\u2019s points of view.\u201d",

On 30 July 2019, he says Museveni or his aides blocked his account, without notice or affording the applicant a hearing \u2013 infringing his right against discrimination as guaranteed in the constitution, his freedom of speech and expression, and his right to participate in the affairs of government and peaceful activities to influence the policies of government. Government spokesperson Ofwono Opondo and the director of political commissariat at Uganda\u2019s police force, Asan Kasingye, who blocked Seguya on 8 August and 20 July respectively, are also named in the lawsuit. In his legal complaint, filed on Monday, Seguya said: \u201cThe[ir] actions did not protect my freedom against political persecution and [restricted my] rights, which are acceptable and demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society.\u201d Male Mabirizi Kiwanuka, who filed the petition on his behalf, said Seguya could have been blocked by the president, or his aides, after a critical post he made in April, in which he told the Ghanaian president, Nana Akufo-Addo, that he would rather have him as president than Museveni. \u201cI wish we could exchange you for our Ugandan president dictator, General Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who has been for 33 years,\u201d said Seguya after Akufo-Addo made a presentation on Pan-Africanism to a group of students at Harvard University. \u201cWe are telling him enough is enough. He has to go,\u201d he said. Kiwanuka said that Seguya was not aware of any reason why Museveni, Ofwono Opondo and Kasingye blocked him. \u201cWe want the court to set aside what they did because he was not heard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are only trying to guess \u2013 is it because [Seguya] asked Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana to substitute Museveni, who is a dictator for 33 years?\u201d he said. \u201cWe are suing under the judicial review for court to review this decision. It was reached without fair hearing.\u201d The case comes less than a month after Stella Nyanzi, a Ugandan women\u2019s rights activist who branded Yoweri Museveni \u201ca dirty, delinquent dictator\u201d and \u201ca pair of buttocks\u201d, received an 18-month jail sentence for cyber harassment against the president. She was acquitted of a charge of offensive communication. Nyanzi, a former researcher at Makerere University, was arrested on 2 November after posting a poem on Facebook that the state deemed abusive towards Museveni and his late mother. Don Wanyama, the senior press secretary to Museveni, said the president will only respond to Seguya\u2019s lawsuit in court. Kasingye said that commenting on the matter would be sub judice. He added that he would give his reasons for blocking Seguya in court, \u201cwhen I go to defend myself\u201d. The president\u2019s Twitter account, @KagutaMuseveni, has 1.1 million followers; @OfwonoOpondo has 104,300 followers and @AKasingye has 59,500 followers In July, 2017, Donald Trump was sued for blocking people on Twitter, a case he lost when a federal court ruled that it violated the first amendment.",

Washington and Beijing have ratcheted up the tariffs they impose on each other\u2019s goods, while Donald Trump spooked markets last week by demanding that US companies repatriate their operations from China. Central banks around the world have come under pressure to ease monetary policy to provide more support as the global economy feels the strain of falling trade volumes and weaker investment by increasingly cautious businesses.

The rising price of computer games, consoles and hotels lifted the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation to 2.1% in July from 2% in June, above the forecasts of City economists. Analysts warned that no-deal Brexit fears hitting the pound would push up inflation over the coming months, as falls in sterling raise the cost of importing goods. The latest figures also confirmed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/aug/14/rail-fares-to-rise-in-january\">rise in UK rail fares of 2.8% for January</a>, set using the retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation, which is usually higher than CPI.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Imports slump after stockpiling rush</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"trade\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;trade&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain recorded the first monthly trade surplus in more than eight years in June amid a plunge in imports, as UK companies eased back from stockpiling goods from abroad. British firms had rushed to buy goods from the EU and elsewhere in the lead-up to the original 29 March Brexit deadline, leading to an imports surge and pushing the UK trade deficit \u2013 the gap between imports and exports \u2013 to the highest levels on record. Now running down their supplies rather than placing new orders, imports have fallen. Over the three months to June, imports plunged by \u00a318bn. The UK goods and services trade balance was in surplus by \u00a31.8bn in June, after a deficit of \u00a32bn in May, beating the forecasts of City economists.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Recession fears linger despite rising business activity</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"pmi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;pmi&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain\u2019s dominant services sector recorded an unexpected rise in economic output last month, according to the closely watched purchasing managers index from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. The increase in activity in the sector which includes hotels, restaurants and finance accounts for about 80% of GDP \u2013 which could spell good news for the wider economy. However, economists warned that the UK remained close to stalling point on the brink of recession.

The UK jobless rate rose to 3.9% from 3.8% in the three months to May, worse than had been expected by City economists. Despite the slight increase, unemployment remains at the lowest levels since the mid 1970s. Workers\u2019 pay growth increased to the fastest pace in 11 years, as the rising government minimum wage helped drive up average wages. According to the Office for National Statistics, annual average pay \u2013 excluding bonuses \u2013 rose by 3.9% in the three months to June, the highest rate since June 2008. However, average wages after inflation remain below the pre-financial crisis peak.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Online spending fuels retail sales growth</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"retail\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;retail&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Consumer spending in Britain unexpectedly increased in July, helped by the strongest rise in online spending in three years. In a sign that consumers are continuing to take the heightened levels of political turmoil over Brexit in their stride, the volume of goods sold in July increased by 0.2% on the month. City economists had forecast a fall in spending by a similar amount. Analysts said that rising wage growth and relatively steady inflation has helped rebuild UK consumers\u2019 spending power, although they warned that no-deal Brexit could induce a sharp fall in consumption over the months ahead.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Johnson\u2019s spending spree raises public borrowing</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"borrowing\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;borrowing&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Boris Johnson is on course to overshoot the government\u2019s budget target by at least \u00a38bn this year after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/13/205bn-nhs-funding-boost-not-enough-to-improve-care-study\">extra spending on the NHS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/31/labour-attacks-appalling-waste-as-johnson-adds-2bn-no-deal-brexit-fund\">preparations for a no-deal Brexit</a> cut the surplus in July. The public finances were down by \u00a32.2bn compared with July 2018 to leave a \u00a31.3bn surplus last month, worse than had been expected by City analysts. Alongside January, July is typically a surplus month because individuals make their self-assessment returns in those months. However, the surplus was smaller than expected due to rises in central government spending, much of it on salaries, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/13/civil-service-seeks-staff-for-no-deal-brexit-crisis-centre\">Whitehall departments stepped up hiring</a> to cope with Brexit. The weaker position in the public finances comes as Johnson pledges to raise spending across the board, on areas such as police, defence, the NHS and Brexit planning.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>House prices fall as Brexit fears mount</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"rics\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;rics&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Mounting fears of no-deal Brexit appear to have dragged down house prices across the country last month, as families showed an increasing reluctance to moving home amid the political turmoil.

However, conditions for global trade have deteriorated significantly in recent months as the US-China trade war rages.

Economic growth has slowed in several countries, including in the US and the eurozone, as fears mount of a global recession. Economists warn that leaving the EU \u2013 which is the world\u2019s largest free trading bloc \u2013 into an increasingly protectionist world could further damage the UK economy. <br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/08/brexit-dashboard-auto\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/07/brexit-dashboard-enhancer-v2\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Washington and Beijing have ratcheted up the tariffs they impose on each other\u2019s goods, while Donald Trump spooked markets last week by demanding that US companies repatriate their operations from China. Central banks around the world have come under pressure to ease monetary policy to provide more support as the global economy feels the strain of falling trade volumes and weaker investment by increasingly cautious businesses. Trump is demanding the US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, as fears grow over an economic slowdown in the US. Worse than forecast Shock inflation rise hits households UK inflation unexpectedly rose above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target in July, putting renewed pressure on British households as the cost of living increased. The rising price of computer games, consoles and hotels lifted the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation to 2.1% in July from 2% in June, above the forecasts of City economists. Analysts warned that no-deal Brexit fears hitting the pound would push up inflation over the coming months, as falls in sterling raise the cost of importing goods. The latest figures also confirmed a rise in UK rail fares of 2.8% for January, set using the retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation, which is usually higher than CPI. Better than forecast Imports slump after stockpiling rush Britain recorded the first monthly trade surplus in more than eight years in June amid a plunge in imports, as UK companies eased back from stockpiling goods from abroad. British firms had rushed to buy goods from the EU and elsewhere in the lead-up to the original 29 March Brexit deadline, leading to an imports surge and pushing the UK trade deficit \u2013 the gap between imports and exports \u2013 to the highest levels on record. Now running down their supplies rather than placing new orders, imports have fallen. Over the three months to June, imports plunged by \u00a318bn. The UK goods and services trade balance was in surplus by \u00a31.8bn in June, after a deficit of \u00a32bn in May, beating the forecasts of City economists. Better than forecast Recession fears linger despite rising business activity Britain\u2019s dominant services sector recorded an unexpected rise in economic output last month, according to the closely watched purchasing managers index from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. The increase in activity in the sector which includes hotels, restaurants and finance accounts for about 80% of GDP \u2013 which could spell good news for the wider economy. However, economists warned that the UK remained close to stalling point on the brink of recession. The manufacturing and construction sectors remained in contraction, as Brexit fears weigh down on British firms\u2019 activities. Worse than forecast Unemployment rises while wages grow Unemployment unexpectedly increased in the three months to June in a sign that the UK jobs market is gradually running out of steam as Brexit looms. The UK jobless rate rose to 3.9% from 3.8% in the three months to May, worse than had been expected by City economists. Despite the slight increase, unemployment remains at the lowest levels since the mid 1970s. Workers\u2019 pay growth increased to the fastest pace in 11 years, as the rising government minimum wage helped drive up average wages. According to the Office for National Statistics, annual average pay \u2013 excluding bonuses \u2013 rose by 3.9% in the three months to June, the highest rate since June 2008. However, average wages after inflation remain below the pre-financial crisis peak. Better than forecast Online spending fuels retail sales growth Consumer spending in Britain unexpectedly increased in July, helped by the strongest rise in online spending in three years. In a sign that consumers are continuing to take the heightened levels of political turmoil over Brexit in their stride, the volume of goods sold in July increased by 0.2% on the month. City economists had forecast a fall in spending by a similar amount. Analysts said that rising wage growth and relatively steady inflation has helped rebuild UK consumers\u2019 spending power, although they warned that no-deal Brexit could induce a sharp fall in consumption over the months ahead. Worse than forecast Johnson\u2019s spending spree raises public borrowing Boris Johnson is on course to overshoot the government\u2019s budget target by at least \u00a38bn this year after extra spending on the NHS and preparations for a no-deal Brexit cut the surplus in July. The public finances were down by \u00a32.2bn compared with July 2018 to leave a \u00a31.3bn surplus last month, worse than had been expected by City analysts. Alongside January, July is typically a surplus month because individuals make their self-assessment returns in those months. However, the surplus was smaller than expected due to rises in central government spending, much of it on salaries, as Whitehall departments stepped up hiring to cope with Brexit. The weaker position in the public finances comes as Johnson pledges to raise spending across the board, on areas such as police, defence, the NHS and Brexit planning. Worse than forecast House prices fall as Brexit fears mount Mounting fears of no-deal Brexit appear to have dragged down house prices across the country last month, as families showed an increasing reluctance to moving home amid the political turmoil. A gauge of house prices from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors \u2013 which shows the difference between members reporting price rises and falls \u2013 dropped to -9 in July from -1 in June, a steeper decline than had been forecast by City economists. According to official figures, house prices in the south of England are falling for the first time since 2009, amid a broader slowdown across the country since the Brexit vote. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 Britain is preparing to leave the EU as the global economy slows Supporters of Brexit argue that leaving the EU would enable the UK to strike new trade deals elsewhere around the world. However, conditions for global trade have deteriorated significantly in recent months as the US-China trade war rages. The escalation of the long-running dispute between Washington and Beijing has sunk factory output around the world and dragged down business investment, with companies reluctant to spend while the world\u2019s two biggest economic superpowers impose tariffs on one another\u2019s goods. According to surveys of global factory output compiled by IHS Markit, the tensions have tipped world manufacturing into recession territory. Economic growth has slowed in several countries, including in the US and the eurozone, as fears mount of a global recession. Economists warn that leaving the EU \u2013 which is the world\u2019s largest free trading bloc \u2013 into an increasingly protectionist world could further damage the UK economy.",

The city\u2019s leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday the government will use existing laws to \u201cput a stop to violence and chaos\u201d, after the pro-Beijing newspaper Sing Tao Daily said the government was considering invoking the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, a colonial era law with sweeping powers that was last used in 1967, to put an end to the current political crisis. Another official, Edward Yau, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, said he did not rule out the option, saying he believed the international community would understand and trade would be unaffected. The South China Morning Post also quoted a government source on Wednesday saying the administration would not rule out the option. The violent clashes between riot police and protesters last weekend were the fiercest yet since early June, when a wave of protests started in opposition to a now-suspended extradition bill under which individuals could be sent to mainland China for trial. Police used water cannon for the first time on Sunday along with teargas and beatings as they fought running battles with protesters, who threw bricks and petrol bombs. Protesters have been demanding the complete withdrawal of the bill, the investigation of police use of force and free elections but Lam reiterated on Tuesday she would not give into their demands. The Emergency Regulations Ordinance, introduced in 1922, grants the city\u2019s leader sweeping powers to \u201cmake any regulations\u201d he or she may consider in the public interest in situations considered \u201can occasion of emergency or public danger.\u201d These regulations will empower the government to impose a series of draconian measures, including censorship, control and suppression of publications and other means of communications, arrest, detention and deportation as well as the authorisation of the entry and search of premises and the taking of possession or control of any property. Professor Michael Davis, a Global Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre and former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, called the law \u201ca nuclear option\u201d which \u201ccan literally run a dictatorship and suspend most rights.\u201d He said it should only be used in a situation when \u201cthe life of a nation is under threat\u201d and the current demonstrations, in which only a relatively small number of people are using aggressive tactics, do not pose such a threat. \u201cThis nuclear option is not going to solve their problems, it\u2019s going to enhance their problems,\u201d he said. Kenneth Chan, a political scientist at the Baptist University of Hong Kong, said it would be \u201ca sign of weakness\u201d for the government to use an antiquated law which had been considered obsolete after the Hong Kong Bill of Rights was introduced in 1991. \u201cThere will be fatal political and economic consequences that not all among the ruling elites in Hong Kong and Beijing are prepared to face,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the international community will draw the conclusion that this idea puts Hong Kong to greater danger than the on-going protests because it sets the stage for the beginning of the end of the rule of law in Hong Kong and paves the way for direct rule from Beijing,\u201d he said. The threat to use arbitrary emergency powers to crush the anti-government movement \u201cwill only fuel public disdain and mobilise stronger support for the anti-government protests\u201d, he said.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018Imagine yourself lying on a beach or swimming in the sea, or anywhere your mind wants to go.\u201d</p> <p>Archery instructor Katie was trying to get me to switch off, mentally, so that I could snap back into the zone when I shot my next arrow. All well and good, but I was in rather a lovely wood in Devon, and my mind insisted on making this attractive grove its happy place. At least that\u2019s the excuse I gave myself as my arrows thwacked merrily into all that white paper surrounding the colourful target.</p> <p>The wood that was doing its best to distract me is a five-hectare affair amid fertile farmland a little to the south of Exmoor. It\u2019s home and livelihood to owners Anna and Pete Grugeon, who came to live in it 10 years ago. They have rescued what was a badly degraded wood and turned it into a nature reserve called the <a href=\"https://bulworthy.uk/\">Bulworthy Project</a> (it\u2019s on the crest of a hill known as Bulworthy Knap), and have earned a crust from the traditional practice of charcoal-making.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/devon-zip/giv-3902dVjga12EhHkx\" data-alt=\"Devon map.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/devon-zip/giv-3902dVjga12EhHkx\">Devon map.</a> </figure>  <p>Now they\u2019ve also built an off-grid cabin within its sylvan canopy, which is where a friend and I had a two-night break. The money from our visit helped maintain the wood, too: the couple pledge they\u2019ll plant a tree for every night their cabin is booked.</p> <p>In this spirit of eco-friendliness, we had decided to travel by train and bicycle, a move which also gave us the opportunity to explore Bulworthy\u2019s rural hinterland. On the 15-mile ride from Tiverton Parkway station we had chanced upon a National Cycle Network route that had us bowling happily <a href=\"https://www.visitsouthdevon.co.uk/things-to-do/grand-western-canal-cycle-route-p243693\" title=\"\">along the Grand Western Canal towpath</a> for half the journey. (And at the end of our all-too-short sojourn, we returned home along quiet country lanes to Eggesford\u2019s bijou branch-line station, where we ate a fine alfresco lunch at a recently established trackside cafe, the <a href=\"https://eggesford-crossing-cafe.business.site/\" title=\"\">Eggesford Crossing Cafe</a>.) </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"225cecc904b35d5deba378dc9cd5aa387c57f709\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/225cecc904b35d5deba378dc9cd5aa387c57f709/0_215_3906_2343/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bedroom at the Bulworthy Project cabin, Devon, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bedroom at the cabin</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once settled into our new micro home-from-home, we\u2019d ambled through the trees to join our hosts for a guided tour of their wood, something they offer free to all guests.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we moved in 10 years ago,\u201d Pete said, \u201cthis was all dense conifers.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to describe a wood in a very sorry state. The neglect had been exacerbated by a previous owner, who had erected a deer fence that the local red deer had had no trouble in vaulting from an adjacent embankment. Once they\u2019d got in, they found the fence was too high for them to leap back over, so scores of them had been trapped. The couple\u2019s first task on buying the wood was to usher the captives out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dd2d095090ed7d1534a5b8f151ad10f7e92722b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dd2d095090ed7d1534a5b8f151ad10f7e92722b/0_358_3672_3672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bulworthy Project\u2019s co-owner, Pete, giving Dixe a tour of the wood, Devon, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bulworthy Project\u2019s co-owner, Pete, giving Dixe a tour of the wood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A decade on, the impenetrable walls of spruce have been largely replaced by a variety of trees, including oaks, birches, beeches and hazels. We wandered together along winding paths and an ancient narrow track on an embankment, whose gnarly beeches formed an enchanting tunnel. It was easy to see why Anna and Pete had chosen this wood after years of dreaming of living in one.</p> <p>\u201cWe try to be as self-sufficient as possible,\u201d said Anna as we greeted the couple\u2019s chickens and pigs, also woodland dwellers. There are ceps, chanterelles, wild raspberries and hazelnuts aplenty and Anna has become quite the winemaker too \u2013 that night we sampled a bottle of her elderberry wine, left for us in the cabin.</p> <p>The couple are an inspiration to anyone who feels they can\u2019t follow their dream because they lack the relevant formal training. Not content with teaching themselves woodland husbandry from scratch, they also became proficient amateur builders. \u201cWe put that up that first,\u201d said Pete, as he pointed to an already venerable-looking shed. \u201cAnd having learned from that, we built our house.\u201d Like you do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5a0ae11c9b4527e276be4136321e7264f3ea71f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5a0ae11c9b4527e276be4136321e7264f3ea71f/0_160_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A path in the wood, near the Bulworthy Project cabin, in Devon, UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A path in the wood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After that, constructing the cabin must have seemed like child\u2019s play. They used a fallen oak for the frame, cherrywood for the window ledges, and fashioned a bedhead from a section of holly tree. The effect of all this timber was that when we went inside, it didn\u2019t really feel like we were leaving the wood.</p> <p>Sadly, for most of our stay the gods of the English summer had set their faces against us. However, a woodburning stove made the cabin cosy and also proved an efficient heater of water. A fire on our first evening was still helping provide hot showers two mornings later in our spacious en suite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97d869063d176fed3561ce9ba2246aba0a23085e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97d869063d176fed3561ce9ba2246aba0a23085e/0_109_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cabin interior of kitchen area and logburner at the Bulworthy Project, Devon, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cabin interior</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Solar panels supply power for the electric coolbox, all the lighting, wifi and a phone-charging point (though why anyone staying here would want to keep in touch with the outside world is a mystery). A well-stocked kitchen has gas hobs and running hot-and-cold water, and just outside the porch where we ate our breakfasts, we found a hammock, a barbecue, and a firepit with its own a tree-trunk bench.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, we were reluctant to leave our sanctuary. We were content, however, to make languid perambulations: hunting for orchids or scanning the branches for marsh and willow tits.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Imagine yourself lying on a beach or swimming in the sea, or anywhere your mind wants to go.\u201d Archery instructor Katie was trying to get me to switch off, mentally, so that I could snap back into the zone when I shot my next arrow. All well and good, but I was in rather a lovely wood in Devon, and my mind insisted on making this attractive grove its happy place. At least that\u2019s the excuse I gave myself as my arrows thwacked merrily into all that white paper surrounding the colourful target. The wood that was doing its best to distract me is a five-hectare affair amid fertile farmland a little to the south of Exmoor. It\u2019s home and livelihood to owners Anna and Pete Grugeon, who came to live in it 10 years ago. They have rescued what was a badly degraded wood and turned it into a nature reserve called the Bulworthy Project (it\u2019s on the crest of a hill known as Bulworthy Knap), and have earned a crust from the traditional practice of charcoal-making. Now they\u2019ve also built an off-grid cabin within its sylvan canopy, which is where a friend and I had a two-night break. The money from our visit helped maintain the wood, too: the couple pledge they\u2019ll plant a tree for every night their cabin is booked. In this spirit of eco-friendliness, we had decided to travel by train and bicycle, a move which also gave us the opportunity to explore Bulworthy\u2019s rural hinterland. On the 15-mile ride from Tiverton Parkway station we had chanced upon a National Cycle Network route that had us bowling happily along the Grand Western Canal towpath for half the journey. (And at the end of our all-too-short sojourn, we returned home along quiet country lanes to Eggesford\u2019s bijou branch-line station, where we ate a fine alfresco lunch at a recently established trackside cafe, the Eggesford Crossing Cafe.) Once settled into our new micro home-from-home, we\u2019d ambled through the trees to join our hosts for a guided tour of their wood, something they offer free to all guests. \u201cWhen we moved in 10 years ago,\u201d Pete said, \u201cthis was all dense conifers.\u201d He went on to describe a wood in a very sorry state. The neglect had been exacerbated by a previous owner, who had erected a deer fence that the local red deer had had no trouble in vaulting from an adjacent embankment. Once they\u2019d got in, they found the fence was too high for them to leap back over, so scores of them had been trapped. The couple\u2019s first task on buying the wood was to usher the captives out. A decade on, the impenetrable walls of spruce have been largely replaced by a variety of trees, including oaks, birches, beeches and hazels. We wandered together along winding paths and an ancient narrow track on an embankment, whose gnarly beeches formed an enchanting tunnel. It was easy to see why Anna and Pete had chosen this wood after years of dreaming of living in one. \u201cWe try to be as self-sufficient as possible,\u201d said Anna as we greeted the couple\u2019s chickens and pigs, also woodland dwellers. There are ceps, chanterelles, wild raspberries and hazelnuts aplenty and Anna has become quite the winemaker too \u2013 that night we sampled a bottle of her elderberry wine, left for us in the cabin. The couple are an inspiration to anyone who feels they can\u2019t follow their dream because they lack the relevant formal training. Not content with teaching themselves woodland husbandry from scratch, they also became proficient amateur builders. \u201cWe put that up that first,\u201d said Pete, as he pointed to an already venerable-looking shed. \u201cAnd having learned from that, we built our house.\u201d Like you do. After that, constructing the cabin must have seemed like child\u2019s play. They used a fallen oak for the frame, cherrywood for the window ledges, and fashioned a bedhead from a section of holly tree. The effect of all this timber was that when we went inside, it didn\u2019t really feel like we were leaving the wood. Sadly, for most of our stay the gods of the English summer had set their faces against us. However, a woodburning stove made the cabin cosy and also proved an efficient heater of water. A fire on our first evening was still helping provide hot showers two mornings later in our spacious en suite. Solar panels supply power for the electric coolbox, all the lighting, wifi and a phone-charging point (though why anyone staying here would want to keep in touch with the outside world is a mystery). A well-stocked kitchen has gas hobs and running hot-and-cold water, and just outside the porch where we ate our breakfasts, we found a hammock, a barbecue, and a firepit with its own a tree-trunk bench. Unsurprisingly, we were reluctant to leave our sanctuary. We were content, however, to make languid perambulations: hunting for orchids or scanning the branches for marsh and willow tits. We did drag ourselves away one evening, riding the short distance to the village of Rackenford. The Stag, its former drovers\u2019 inn (\u201cOne man here remembers driving his sheep into the front room,\u201d co-owner Oliver told us), is claimed to be the oldest pub in Devon. Oliver showed us its witches\u2019 marks: small holes burned into the ancient woodwork to trap evil spirits that came down the chimney. He also introduced us to Psychopomp, a Bristol micro-distillery whose moreish gin was served with a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds. Back at the wood, Anna and Pete hold occasional courses in charcoal- and bow-making, and have teamed up with a neighbour who gives lessons in clay shooting and archery. That neighbour happens to be Katie Cox, who has represented Devon, England and Great Britain, and whose prowess at various forms of clay shooting has already won her a heap of trophies and a European bronze medal.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Tories are trying to sound tough\u2019 Good morning from me, Warren Murray. Here\u2019s something for the news-hungry but time-poor likes of yourself. A crackdown on student behaviour and more free schools are to be announced by the government within days, according to a confidential briefing paper seen by the Guardian. It details proposals for schools in England designed to be rolled out over the coming weeks in an attempt to seize the initiative before a possible autumn election. Proposals including a \u00a33.5bn funding announcement and plans to increase teachers\u2019 basic pay may be broadly welcomed but there will be concern over disciplinary measures that include a renewed emphasis on exclusions and allowing teachers to use \u201creasonable force\u201d to improve behaviour. \u201cThe Tories are trying to sound tough whilst failing to look at the evidence,\u201d said the Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman, Layla Moran. In other signs of an election footing, the first major speech by the chancellor, Sajid Javid, has been cancelled by the Treasury less than 24 hours before it was due to take place. A Treasury spokesman said its theme would instead be covered in the one-year spending review, which is being fast-tracked to take place on 4 September \u2013 the date MPs return to parliament. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Jeremy Corbyn, meeting with opposition parties, has agreed that legislating to prevent a no-deal Brexit should be their priority when parliament returns, rather than seeking a snap vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson, the PM. &gt; Purdue Pharma and members of the Sackler family whose company makes the opioid painkiller OxyContin have reportedly offered to settle more than 2,000 lawsuits for between $10bn and $12bn after a $572m verdict against Johnson &amp; Johnson. &gt; The advertising watchdog has banned a Home Office radio advert that wrongly said EU citizens only needed a passport or ID card to apply to stay in the UK post-Brexit. In fact, some applicants need to provide proof of address covering the last five years. &gt; Hundreds of asylum seekers crammed into \u201cguest houses\u201d overrun by cockroaches, rats and mice have seen a raft of improvements in the past few days after the Guardian exposed the conditions. The Home Office confirmed it was taking \u201curgent action\u201d to improve the facilities run by contractor Clearsprings Ready Homes. &gt; North Korea may have warheads that can dodge their way through the missile shield over Japan, the defence minister in Tokyo has warned. Takeshi Iwaya pointed to irregular trajectories of projectiles recently tested by Kim Jong-un\u2019s military. &gt; Jaunty stories about record bank holiday temperatures have glossed over the reality of the climate crisis, experts say. All of the UK\u2019s 10 hottest years on record have occurred since since 2002, while record-shattering temperatures in Europe last month were a one-in-a-thousand-year event. * * * Epstein accusers speak \u2013 An accuser of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has addressed her claim that she was coerced into sex with Prince Andrew, saying he \u201cknows what he\u2019s done\u201d. Virginia Giuffre spoke outside federal court in Manhattan where two dozen women detailed alleged sexual abuse by Epstein during court testimony that was allowed to go ahead by the judge after Epstein\u2019s death brought an end to his criminal case. The prince has always vehemently denied the allegations \u2013 in 2015 a court decided they were \u201cimmaterial and impertinent\u201d and ordered them struck out of a claim against Epstein. * * * \u2018I look like a stick\u2019 \u2013 Childhood happiness has become a national scandal after falling to its lowest level in a decade, the Children\u2019s Society says. More than 200,000 children are unhappy with their lives, according to the society\u2019s annual Good Childhood report, with average contentment among 10- to 15-year-olds dipping to 7.89 out of 10, at a time when adults\u2019 sense of wellbeing is improving. The society has called on Boris Johnson to prioritise the issue and introduce a national measurement of children\u2019s wellbeing. Anxiety among boys about their appearance is on the rise \u2013 one boy surveyed blamed \u201cInstagram and stuff \u2026 you see all these weightlifters, bodybuilders, and you look at yourself and you\u2019re like: \u2018I look like a stick.\u2019 I feel like we\u2019re exposed to a lot more, so we are less secure about our appearance.\u201d * * * Razak in dock over 1MDB \u2013 The trial has opened in Kuala Lumpur of the former Malaysian PM Najib Razak over the 1MDB corruption scandal. Najib is accused of laundering 2.3bn ringgit (\u00a3440m/$540m) of the Malaysian government\u2019s 1MDB fund for his own financial reward. He denies the charges and says he was misled by others involved in running the fund. 1MDB has been described as the \u201cbiggest kleptocracy scandal in the world\u201d, with more than $4.5bn of state money spent in Malaysia and around the world on everything from Manhattan real estate and diamonds to Pablo Picasso paintings and Hollywood films. * * * Meat off the menu \u2013 Vegan meals are now the UK\u2019s fastest growing takeaway choice, according to something called the British Takeaway Campaign, with burgers made from black beans, sweet potato and quinoa and vegan \u201cfried chicken\u201d among dishes challenging doner kebabs and tikka masala. Pakistani, Greek, Persian and Turkish takeaways also grew in popularity more rapidly than staples such as Chinese, Indian and fish and chips. Deliveroo reported that vegan orders had quadrupled over the past two years and in the past 12 months the number of vegan restaurants on the app increased by 168%. Lunchtime read: Lessons from the summer box office Fewer reboots! More Keanu! Less Shaft! The summer season at the cinema is over and it\u2019s time to sift through the hits and misses with Benjamin Lee to see what was hot, what flopped, and what the movie industry can learn from it all. Sport The English Football League has promised to upgrade its rules to prevent a repeat of the implosion of Bury FC, after a day that began with optimism ended in despair, disbelief and fury as one of England\u2019s oldest football clubs was kicked out of the EFL after 125 years. Thirteen miles away, the fate of Bolton Wanderers also looks increasingly perilous as the club was given 14 days to save its membership in a league it helped found in 1888. Britain\u2019s Kyle Edmund can be proud that, unlike Stefanos Tsitsipas, he left the US Open with his dignity intact, fighting for every second of the four hours and 21 minutes it took Pablo And\u00fajar to subdue him in five sets of the most honest endeavour. In the women\u2019s draw, Naomi Osaka overcame intense nerves and a stuttering start to open her US Open title defence with victory over Russia\u2019s Anna Blinkova. Internazionale have finally reached a deal to sign Alexis S\u00e1nchez on a loan from Manchester United. And veteran prop Owen Franks was the big-name omission as the All Blacks named their squad to defend the Rugby World Cup in Japan. Business Two economists paint a downbeat picture of the UK economy in the past month as part of our regular look at how Brexit is affecting business and finance. One of our experts, the former Bank of England rate-setter David Blanchflower, says Brexit couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time as the world economy slows. The continuing squeeze on real wages is depressing, he says. On the markets, the FTSE100 will reflect Asian markets when it opens flat this morning and the pound is buying \u00a31.228 and \u20ac1.107.

Kyrgios was just too good really. Here\u2019s Kyrgios:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cI wanted to thank you guys for staying out late. I appreciate that. Steve is a hell of a player. He played well. I knew I had to serve well. I knew [the second] was an important set. I\u2019m just happy I got it done in two hours. I can go to a pub and get some food.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>He adds that he\u2019s not a fan of the late nights and hopes to get on court at a more reasonable time in future games.

      "bodyText": "So, Kyrgios moves on after a relatively straight-forward assignment against Johnson. He\u2019ll be pleased with his service game, for sure, as he heads into a second round meeting with the 23-year-old Frenchman Antoine Hoang, who beat Leonardo Mayer in five sets earlier in the day. That\u2019s all from me for now. Thanks for joining, until next time. Off goes Steve Johnson, a decent showing from the American. Kyrgios was just too good really. Here\u2019s Kyrgios: \u201cI wanted to thank you guys for staying out late. I appreciate that. Steve is a hell of a player. He played well. I knew I had to serve well. I knew [the second] was an important set. I\u2019m just happy I got it done in two hours. I can go to a pub and get some food.\u201d He adds that he\u2019s not a fan of the late nights and hopes to get on court at a more reasonable time in future games. He\u2019s going to go to a cafe and chill tomorrow, on his day off, apparently. Third set: Johnson *3-6, 6-7 (1-7), 4-6 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios books his place in the second round with just two hours on the match clock! Unsurprisingly it\u2019s his serve that helps power him to this final game to wrap up an excellent overall performance from the Australian. A few blips here and there, but nothing too major. Third set: Johnson *3-6, 6-7 (1-7), 4-5 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Oh wow, how to describe this shot? Classic Kyrgios \u2013 a running, jumping mid-air between-the-legs effort down the line that lands... just out. Still, 10 out of 10 for flair. Johnson holds, but he\u2019s not happy with something. He points to his chest and utters an expletive (for which the TV commentators don\u2019t apologise, interestingly). Anyway, Kyrgios will now serve for the match. Third set: Johnson 3-6, 6-7 (1-7), 3-5 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Yet more powerful serving from Kyrgios sees the Australian move to within a game of the match. No problems at all this game for him. Third set: *Johnson 3-6, 6-7 (1-7), 3-4 Kyrgios (*denotes server): As the clock ticks over to 1am, Johnson hangs in there with a decent hold. Still, he\u2019s going to have to break Kyrgios twice more to get out of trouble. That\u2019s a big ask. Stranger things have happened though. Third set: Johnson 3-6, 6-7 (1-7), 2-4 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios turns to his serve once again to deflate Johnson\u2019s sails. The first two points of this game go his way thanks to tremendous serves and despite a brief dip, he moves to within two games of a place in the second round. Third set: *Johnson 3-6, 6-7 (1-7), 2-3 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios falls 30-0 down before a sensational whipped forehand winner finds the line and seems to get him back on track. But Johnson responds with an ace, and he does very well to hold again. Still, Kyrgios holds a break advantage this set though. But Johnson has the wind in his sails after pocketing the last two games. Third set: Johnson 3-6, 6-7 (1-7), 1-3 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios is up out of his chair early and raring to go \u2013 he senses victory here. A double fault to kick things off doesn\u2019t do him any favours though, and seems to knock him off his stride. He concedes the next two points to give Johnson three break-back points. The Australian shouts something about sleeping in the direction of his box. \u201cI know you want to go home,\u201d he shouts to them. And they\u2019re not going anyway for the time being, as Johnson secures his first break of the night! Third set: *Johnson 3-6, 6-7 (1-7), 0-3 Kyrgios (*denotes server): An exchange of drop shots at the net ends in favour of Kyrgios as Johnson loses a sixth consecutive point - 0-30 on the American\u2019s serve. And Kyrgios streaks clear on the first of three break points to open up a commanding lead in this third set. No chuntering at the changeover now \u2013 just a banana to eat and some liquids to be taken on board. Third set: Johnson 3-6, 6-7 (1-7), 0-2 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): People are still taking their time finding seats at the beginning of the game as Kyrgios waits to serve. Boos ring out. Kyrgios double faults. He loses the next point too, and he\u2019s frustrated with himself. At 0-30 down though, a fortunate net cord helps him out and soon after a 140mph serve does likewise. Another ace seals the game, and Kyrgios survives that minor wobble. Third set: *Johnson 3-6, 6-7 (1-7), 0-1 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios apologises to Johnson for a semi-shank that brings up break point for him. The 28th seed then has two changes to smash a winner, twice he passes up that chance, until eventually he does find a winner and the opening breakthrough of the third set is made at the first time of asking. Second set: Johnson 3-6, 6-7 Kyrgios: And there it is. Kyrgios just seemed to channel whatever frustration had creeped into his game in the tie-breaker \u2013 to devastating effect. He loses just the one point on his way to a two-set lead and, baring an almighty capitulation now, he is set fair for the second round. Second set tie break: Johnson 0-6 Kyrgios: Sensational shot-making by Kyrgios! He somehow reaches a brilliant drop shot from Johnson to return a dink over the net and bring up many set points! Second set tie break: Johnson 0-5 Kyrgios: Kyrgios is threatening to run away with this one. He takes a 5-0 lead as he wrongfoots Johnson with a cross-court forehand. Second set tie break: Johnson 0-2 Kyrgios: There\u2019s a brief delay before Kyrgios can get things underway as a spectator finds their way in. The umpire twice asks them to take their seat. Kyrgios then aces and Johnson double faults to give the Australian the early advantage. Second set: *Johnson 3-6, 6-6 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Johnson plays a lovely winner down the line to open this game before Kyrgios\u2019s execution of a drop shot lets him down \u2013 into the net. The American is doing well to stay cool here. He holds and we\u2019ll go into a tie-break. Second set: Johnson 3-6, 5-6 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): More exceptional serving sees Kyrgios get into a position to hold once more at 40-0. But the loss of a point sees the chuntering continue, forcing the members of his box to attempt to offer encouragement and diffuse the situation. Kyrgios still manages to give Johnson a thumbs up for his shot which forces deuce. And the Australian turns to his serve once again to secure the hold, an ace sealing the game. Second set: *Johnson 3-6, 5-5 Kyrgios (*denotes server): We\u2019re seeing everything from Kyrgios here \u2013 sublime tennis but also the usual baggage he comes with. Johnson isn\u2019t allowing himself to get distracted though and the American just gets on with his tennis, holding serve to stay in this second set. Second set: Johnson 3-6, 4-5 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Here we go then. Kyrgios is given a court violation for an audible obscenity. Umpire James Keothavong isn\u2019t impressed. As usual, it\u2019s not entirely obvious what has sparked Kyrgios off, but he\u2019s fired up now. Every point he wins this game is wildly celebrated, not least the one off a blockbuster forehand winner to bring up game point. He backs it up with an ace and he still leads. And it becomes clear at the changeover what fired Kyrgios up \u2013 spectators entering the stadium during play. It appears he\u2019s unhappy with how Keothavong is dealing with the issue. Johnson says: \u201cStop fucking around and let\u2019s play tennis.\u201d Second set: *Johnson 3-6, 4-4 Kyrgios (*denotes server): This is a crucial hold for Johnson, who saves two break points as the pressure begins to tell a bit on Kyrgios. At several times this game he remonstrates, with himself and his box, and are the cracks are beginning to appear? Second set: Johnson 3-6, 3-3 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Another straight-forward service game for Kyrgios \u2013 to love \u2013 is sealed with an ace. Kyrgios, despite the tight shorts issue (which he\u2019s not complaining about anymore, even if he\u2019s pulling them down to stretch them at the changeover), is looking good this set. Second set: *Johnson 3-6, 3-3 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Johnson stays with Kyrgios, holding again to level the ledger. Kyrgios\u2019s mate, Thanasi Kokkinakis, earlier won through to the second, where he\u2019ll play Rafael Nadal. The wildcard entrant needed almost four hours to get past Ilya Ivashka 6-3 7-6 (10-8) 6-7 (7-4) 6-2, a match that left the injury-prone Australian euphoric. \u201cIt was a hell of a feeling. Obviously I feel like I\u2019ve had a lot of my tennis career so far, to this point, taken away. I knew the first two sets, getting those under my belt was going to be big. Luckily I got the second set after I broke a string on set point. What are the odds? I\u2019ve probably been playing for two hours and then on that point it breaks but, you know, that\u2019s tennis. It\u2019s definitely a massive relief.\u201d Second set: Johnson 3-6, 2-3 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Wow. The missiles keep launching from Kyrgios\u2019s arm as he races into a 40-0 lead. An aberration follows, which leads to the Australian chuntering to himself and the TV commentators to apologise \u201cfor the language\u201d. No matter though, and he seals the game without further ado. At the changeover Kyrgios appears unhappy with... his shorts. He shouts over at his box, asking whether he should change them. Second set: *Johnson 3-6, 2-2 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Johnson holds. But not before Kyrgios gets back into the game at 30-40 with a point that he makes looks easy, following a drop shot and then a neatly-executed volley. It goes to deuce. \u201cNiiiiick!\u201d shouts Kyrgios as he goes way long though, and Johnson seals the game. Second set: Johnson 3-6, 1-2 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios hammers down a ninth ace of the night before sealing the game with a ridiculous forehand that he plays stood upright, reaching down low with his racket to meet the ball. That shot can only be described as nonchalant. Second set: *Johnson 3-6, 1-1 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Johnson\u2019s turn now to show his quality, with a lovely backhand volley at the net, having earlier out-manoeuvred his opponent. He gets ahead 40-15 but an overcooked forehand gives Kyrgios a sniff \u2013 until the Australian ends hopes of a break early this set with an overhit effort of his own. Good response from Johnson. Second set: Johnson 3-6, 0-1 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios kicks off the second set in style \u2013 with an ace \u2013 before another follows to go 40-0 up. His next effort is also unplayable, even if Johnson manages to get some of his racket to it this time, and Kyrgios wraps up the game without any fuss. First set: *Johnson 3-6 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios moves closer thanks to a weird shot that doesn\u2019t appear to take a net cord but nevertheless completely fools Johnson, who doesn\u2019t reach the ball. Then Kyrgios, on the first of two break points, fires another winner, his 18th of the night so far, to break again and claim the first set. Impressive stuff so far from the Australian 28th seed. First set: Johnson 3-5 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios can sense the first set here. He closes out another service game to move within a game of the first set. He\u2019s got six aces to his name so far tonight, and 16 winners. First set: *Johnson 3-4 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Wonderful stuff from the Australian after he pops up a return of serve that Johnson should really put away \u2013 only for Kyrgios to whack a backhand with venom right back past him. Two break points for Kyrgios soon follow and although he can\u2019t convert the first, he does on the second with a big reach down to his left to dig out a backhand volleyed winner! And we have our first break of the night. First set: Johnson 3-3 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Here goes the Kyrgios serve again. But it\u2019s not a good start as he double faults first up. He gets a challenge wrong soon after and there follows a bit of grumbling. But he eventually shows his resilience as his serve comes back to his rescue, saving two break points before sealing the game. Still on serve in the opening set. First set: *Johnson 3-2 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios is a bit annoyed with himself \u2013 understandably so \u2013 as a regulation forehand goes into the net and Johnson goes on to claim the lead once again. These first five games have lasted just 12 minutes \u2013 no accusations of taking too long over service points tonight! First set: Johnson 2-2 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Soft, soft hands on Kyrgios and he delivers an inch-perfect drop shot for the first time tonight. And then again, to go 40-15 up, this time as he moves into the net to dink a forehand delightfully across the court. Early signs of Very Good Nick here, with a nice combination of power and finesse. First set: *Johnson 2-1 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios appears to have some rocket fuel in his racket head tonight \u2013 a blistering (and when I say blistering I mean blistering) forehand service return again gets the crowd excited, but Johnson recovers and keeps his composure to see out his service game. Already the crowd seem keen on interaction tonight (even the kid behind Kyrgios is having a chat with him at the changeover). First set: Johnson 1-1 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios elicits some whoops from the crowd with a monster ace before he secures the game in an almost dismissive manner \u2013 a booming forehand return that Johnson can\u2019t get near to. The crowd love that! First set: *Johnson 1-0 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Johnson exhibits his serving prowess early on, acing on his way to a 40-0 lead. A couple of Kyrgios points later, the Australian can only return into the net and Johnson has the first game of the match in his back pocket. First set: *Johnson 0-0 Kyrgios (*denotes server): OK, warm-ups are done and dusted and we\u2019re about to get underway. Kyrgios, in a white shirt and Fiorentina-purple shorts, will receive first with Johnson, sporting a red cap, red shirt and dark shorts (and a bad teenage moustache) to serve first. Here we go. So what\u2019s at stake? Well, quite a bit, given results earlier today. Kyrgios, seeded 28, is now one of just three seeds left in this quarter of the draw, along with No 13 Gael Monfils, No 24 Mateo Berrettini. A quick word on another Australian hope earlier today, John Millman \u2013 he was no match for Rafael Nadal, who is seeking a fourth US Open crown. The Spaniard won in less than two hours, 6-3 6-2 6-2. Despite the one-sided scoreboard, Nadal was full of praise for Millman. \u201cHis movement is great. He showed last year what he is able to do when he is playing well and it was a match I came on court with a lot of respect. I think I played a solid match, the first one, very happy with the victory. My serve worked very well tonight. Hitting good backhands, some more mistakes than usual with the forehand but in general I am happy with the way I started.\u201d It\u2019s just gone 11pm at Flushing Meadows \u2013 this one\u2019s going to go deep into the New York night. The players are about to enter the arena, but before they do, there\u2019s time for a quick chat. Johnson: \u201cI\u2019m going to take care of business on my serve. Just go out there and compete.\u201d Kyrgios: \u201cI\u2019m very excited to be playing Stevie, he\u2019s a good mate of mine. He\u2019ll have the crowd behind him and I\u2019m just going to go out there and have fun. We\u2019ll put on a show for you guys.\u201d Good. OK, we shouldn\u2019t be too far off starting now the previous match on Louis Armstrong has just ended \u2013 Aryna Sabalenka, the ninth-seeded woman this year, was made to fight hard for her place in the second round by fellow Belarusian, Victoria Azarenka. It took Sabalenka 2hrs 13mins to see off her good mate, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. And earlier, Naomi Osaka, the world No 1, got over some early nerves (\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this nervous in my life,\u201d she said) to get past Russia\u2019s Anna Blinkova. Hello and welcome. Who\u2019s knows what to expect today? Will it be dynamic, mercurial Nick, the man capable of thrilling like no other player on the Tour, or the other, less easy to admire Nick, the boy whose on-court behaviour can bewilder, frustrate and disappoint in equal measures? But that\u2019s part of the draw of Nick Kyrgios, isn\u2019t it? The unknown. We\u2019ll find out soon enough if he\u2019s brought his A-game and temperament to NYC \u2013 or not \u2013 when he takes to Louis Armstrong court to face home hope Steve Johnson. The pair are friendly off the court, so perhaps that will have an effect on how this one pans out \u2013 certainly Johnson is expecting have have some fun on court. \u201cMentally, you know it\u2019s any given day [how Kyrgios performs]. He has the talent to be a top-five guy, in my opinion. But this is a hard sport; it\u2019s hard to put your best foot forward every day and that\u2019s what we all try and do. He\u2019s a super nice guy, I always enjoy my time with him. Off the court, he just loves to talk basketball and we kind of hang out, so it\u2019s going to be a fun one. Hopefully it will be a good one.\u201d Much more to come on that one shortly. In case you missed it, there has been plenty of headlines made already at Flushing Meadows today, not least by 15-year-old Coco Gauff, who staged a stirring comeback to beat fellow teenager Anastasia Potapova, and a series of men\u2019s seeds who exited the tournament. As ever, interaction is welcome, so please do get in touch either on email (mike.hytner@theguardian.com) or tweet @mike_hytner. Let\u2019s do this.",

      "bodyText": "Fire authorities across the country are bracing for a challenging bushfire season this summer and are urging Australians to start preparing their homes, properties and evacuation plans early. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre released its seasonal outlook on Wednesday. It warns Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and parts of Western Australia and South Australia face an above normal potential fire threat because of very warm and dry conditions and below average rainfall. \u201cWhen we go into communities post [fires] large portions of the communities are not well prepared for the fire season and a lot of people express surprise that they were to be impacted by fires,\u201d the centre\u2019s chief executive, Richard Thornton, told reporters in Melbourne. The Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s climate monitoring manager, David Jones, said the outlook was grim and the fire threat would be potentially exacerbated by severe drought conditions particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin region. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very good outlook and will certainly be a challenging fire season,\u201d Jones said. In Victoria, authorities are most worried about Gippsland, which has been struggling with record low rainfall. Some areas are still recovering from fires earlier this year, including Bunyip which lost close to 40 homes. There are also strong concerns about the state\u2019s west where there has been good rainfall that\u2019s increased fuel levels. \u201cIt\u2019s cold and it\u2019s wet at the moment but this is the time we need to be thinking about preparing,\u201d the Emergency Management Victoria commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said. \u201cIt\u2019s too late when we\u2019re actually battling a fire.\u201d He flagged last summer\u2019s successful trial of night-time helicopter fire bombing would continue this year. Bruce McDonald from the NSW Rural Fire Service noted his state had been hit with 1,500 fires so far this month and families needed to be proactive about arranging their bushfire survival plans. \u201cI would equate this to 2013, the conditions we are facing.

If fire crews are using landowners\u2019 dam water, a NSW scheme will replace it. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The fire season has started early this year in Queensland and is expected to go later than usual. Fires have already come within metres of homes on the Sunshine Coast and Bribie Island has been hit. The state\u2019s Fire and Emergency Service deputy commissioner, Mark Roche, said the danger zone was from Rockhampton down to the NSW border and out west to the Darling Downs, where there was a shortage of water. Roche said last year\u2019s early fire season was unprecedented and featured never before seen catastrophic conditions. Emergency services in Queensland could be pressed on two fronts. \u201cThe luxury we have in Queensland is you can have bushfires in one part of the state and cyclones in another and at times they are at the same time,\u201d Roche said. The Tasmania Fire Service acting chief officer, Bruce Byatt, said the state\u2019s east coast was at above average risk of large-scale fires and also he predicted early blazes. He warned holidaymakers to also factor in the bushfire threat when planning trips. Authorities in South Australia are most concerned about the fire risk to Kangaroo Island and Eyre Peninsula. In Western Australia, the focus will be on the state\u2019s south as well as around the north-west coast where there\u2019s increased fuel loads following intense rainfall from Cyclone Veronica. The ACT is in a second year of drought and fire authorities are worried about dry conditions in high country bushland. On Wednesday there was a total fire ban in the Northern Territory and fire crews were battling blazes at Dundee Beach, south-west of Darwin, and Lansdowne, near Katherine. A fire ban was also set to be in place on Thursday covering Darwin, Batchelor, Litchfield municipality and Coomalie Shire and the Adelaide River region. Competition for aerial firefighting aircraft could be intense this year but states and territories are adamant teleconferencing and cooperation efforts will ensure the worst-affected areas are prioritised.",

There\u2019s a warmth and an intimacy there which is not allowed for the rest of the week.

Tensions reach boiling point, so physical activities like ping pong \u201crelease that tension\u201d, he believes. \u201cPing pong also brings people together across the prison buildings. You are one big community in prison even though you don\u2019t like half of the people. We all have to mix, we all have to get on, we\u2019re living under each other, like a powder keg situation.\u201d </p> <p>For Jack Finch, 34, the programme changed his life. He was introduced to table tennis in High Down during his two-year sentence. On release he went straight to Brighton Table Tennis Club and got a full-time coaching job in Moulsecoomb, on the outskirts of the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for these kids to do in Moulsecoomb, so when they see me, they\u2019re happy to get involved in something. I\u2019ve been there and it\u2019s tough,\u201d he says. \u201cCrime is the last thing on my mind \u2013 I\u2019ve got so much going on,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I could\u2019ve easily been tempted to go back to it.\u201d</p> <p>Rosie Meek, a psychology professor at Royal Holloway, University of London and author of the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/733184/a-sporting-chance-an-independent-review-sport-in-justice.pdf\" title=\"\">MoJ\u2019s 2018 review of sport in prison,</a> says that giving people a positive and alternative identity to that of an offender is a really powerful predictor to reduce reoffending. \u201cCoaching is a valuable and meaningful way to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we can equip people with the skills once they come out of prison to become volunteers in their communities, to engage their kids, maybe, in table tennis, or even for some to work in this sector \u2026 that\u2019s really powerful.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/11/sport-prevent-reoffending-prisons-justice-system\">How sport in prison could stop reoffending | Rosie Meek</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The programme has proven so successful that the MoJ says it is \u201cconsidering options for extending it further\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Match point. A muscular, tattooed man takes a deep breath before raising a hand to serve. His opponent purses his lips in concentration. The crowd is hushed. A ball is fired across the room, clips the edge of the table, and it\u2019s game over. The crowd erupts in cheers and burly men launch themselves on to the winner. Blokes playing ping pong might seem prosaic enough. Only on this occasion they are in jail. A prison guard watches over the hall, as the banter kicks in and other matches resume, older hands coaching newer members of the group. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s here now is not getting into any trouble, and that\u2019s because there\u2019s an incentive,\u201d says Axel James, 30, a prisoner at HMP High Down in Surrey for the past three years. \u201cYou get a good rapport with the officers. When they know that you are well behaved, you get more gym sessions and it can lead to other sports as well.\u201d He attends the table tennis sessions each week. To qualify for the weekly sessions, inmates must have a good record \u2013 no violence, drugs or abuse are tolerated. Traffic-light stamps that denote behaviour are meticulously recorded in a log book. Too many red entries and prisoners stay locked in their cells. The incentive appears to be working: violent behaviour has fallen by 83% among attendees \u2013 and demand is growing. So far 250 prisoners have passed through the programme since it started two years ago, with many on a waiting list eager to play. The initiative is also aimed at tackling one of Britain\u2019s most stubborn justice problems: the revolving door that puts offenders out on the streets and then sucks them back in again. According to Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures, 29% of adults and 42% of young people reoffend within one year of release. But a select committee report this summer claimed recidivism can be dramatically reduced with sports-based programmes both in and after prison. James looks forward to the sessions all week because he believes the movement and concentration required by the game allow him to mentally break free from the tedium of prison life. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of eye contact, you have to remain focused because it\u2019s a quick game,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I would say it\u2019s an escape for prisoners.\u201d Coaches and volunteers from Brighton Table Tennis Club have been going to High Down every week to train the inmates as table tennis coaches. So far they have awarded 24 level 1 coaching qualifications. The group have got to know each other well, and have developed a genuine camaraderie as the prisoners and volunteers laugh and embrace one another in victory. \u201cI\u2019m really very fond of them,\u201d says Sandie Clark, 72, a volunteer who has travelled the hour to High Down every Tuesday for a year. \u201cThey get scarred by the prison, but when they\u2019re with us they remember who they are. There\u2019s a warmth and an intimacy there which is not allowed for the rest of the week. The fact that people are interested in them gives them a bit of confidence \u2013 many of them are unsure of themselves.\u201d She adds: \u201cThey\u2019re going to come out with more than just a qualification \u2013 it empowers them, they can see other ways of coping with things.\u201d Michael, 51, who used to be at HMP High Down and is now at an open prison, frequently returns on day release for the table tennis club. \u201cAt times, if they\u2019re short staffed and there\u2019s been incidents, people can be left in their cells for three or four days and only come out to get their food and go back to their wing,\u201d he says. Tensions reach boiling point, so physical activities like ping pong \u201crelease that tension\u201d, he believes. \u201cPing pong also brings people together across the prison buildings. You are one big community in prison even though you don\u2019t like half of the people. We all have to mix, we all have to get on, we\u2019re living under each other, like a powder keg situation.\u201d For Jack Finch, 34, the programme changed his life. He was introduced to table tennis in High Down during his two-year sentence. On release he went straight to Brighton Table Tennis Club and got a full-time coaching job in Moulsecoomb, on the outskirts of the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for these kids to do in Moulsecoomb, so when they see me, they\u2019re happy to get involved in something. I\u2019ve been there and it\u2019s tough,\u201d he says. \u201cCrime is the last thing on my mind \u2013 I\u2019ve got so much going on,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I could\u2019ve easily been tempted to go back to it.\u201d Rosie Meek, a psychology professor at Royal Holloway, University of London and author of the MoJ\u2019s 2018 review of sport in prison, says that giving people a positive and alternative identity to that of an offender is a really powerful predictor to reduce reoffending. \u201cCoaching is a valuable and meaningful way to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we can equip people with the skills once they come out of prison to become volunteers in their communities, to engage their kids, maybe, in table tennis, or even for some to work in this sector \u2026 that\u2019s really powerful.\u201d The programme has proven so successful that the MoJ says it is \u201cconsidering options for extending it further\u201d. So far, the nearby women\u2019s prison, HMP Downview, and Ford open prison in West Sussex have introduced similar schemes. The new justice secretary, Robert Buckland, welcomes the ping-pong scheme for \u201ctruly harnessing the power of sport to change lives and reduce reoffending\u201d. He adds: \u201cIt is vital that we set offenders up with worthwhile skills such as teamwork, leadership and discipline, so they have a better chance of securing employment on release and resettling back into the community.\u201d Back at High Down, James believes ping pong is his ticket to a life outside jail. \u201cI would definitely say having a sport like table tennis, having people come in, it opens doors for a lot of people. How are we supposed to be better people if we\u2019re not given that opportunity?\u201d Some names have been changed",

Following a major ceasefire brokered earlier this year between the government and 14 rebel militias, groups of women are coming together across the nation to reinforce the grand strategy for peace at a community level. They are rebuilding their country from the ground up, forging formidable sisterhoods in the ashes of a protracted conflict.</p> \n<p>High rates of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/05/rape-instrument-of-war-central-african-republic-conflict-study-sexual-slavery\">sexual violence</a>, <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/CAF\">maternal mortality and teenage births</a> have made CAR one of the worst places in the world to be a woman.

It is making our relationship more equal. I don\u2019t have to depend on him. I have more strength in the family.\u201d</p> \n<p>Their bakery opened last September, kickstarted by an EU-funded initiative. While this programme was focused primarily on wildlife conservation in the nearby Bamingui-Bangoran national park, officials were keen to reach out to the wider community.

They use all their profits to look after their family and reinvest in the business.\u201d Abaka\u2019s vision for the bakery\u2019s future confirms this.

Many of its members have suffered displacement and witnessed extreme violence, yet despite the war\u2019s divisions along religious lines, Christians and Muslims are welcomed alike.</p> \n<p>Supported by UNHCR, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, the group meets every week on the edge of the capital to discuss their difficulties and successes. From sewing to soap-making, they are taught new skills, helping them foster solidarity and a boisterous, entrepreneurial spirit.</p> \n<p>\u201cLittle by little women are getting together to fight back,\u201d says Atanguere, a mother of six who saw her brother stabbed to death when rebels stormed her neighbourhood in late 2013. She fled to a squalid camp for displaced people and eventually returned home three years later, founding the association with the women she met there. \u201cWe are sisters. We are all Central Africans. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re Muslim or Christian.

Some are building in flexibility ahead of the wedding, opting for outfits that will transition smoothly from aisle or register office to boardroom or holiday. After all, single-use dresses are bad for the environment and the bank balance, with the average British wedding dress last year costing nearly \u00a31,400.</p> <p>Anita Gera was one of those who answered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/aug/15/tell-us-how-have-you-reused-your-wedding-dress\" title=\"\">our call for stories about reusing wedding clothes</a>. She got married in Copenhagen in 2006, and has continued to wear the constituent parts of<strong> </strong>her outfit \u2013 a tunic, trousers and dupatta (a long scarf) \u2013 to parties, although the marriage is now over. On a recent mini-cruise with her mum to Hamburg, a gala night provided an opportunity to wear the whole ensemble. It helps that it is bright red. \u201cI grew up in India,\u201d she explains, \u201cso, to me, white is the colour of funerals and red is the colour you wear for joyous occasions.\u201d While she wouldn\u2019t wear her outfit in India, she felt comfortable on the cruise ship: \u201cI know it\u2019s my wedding outfit but to most people it will just look like some glamorous Bollywood-style outfit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2965efc9bcced4e69bc6ae9ec4bc671a816d7395\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2965efc9bcced4e69bc6ae9ec4bc671a816d7395/1_0_5330_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anita Gera on her wedding day and (right) wearing her repurposed outfit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anita Gera on her wedding day and (right) wearing her repurposed outfit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sophie Pollard also bought an outfit she could wear again. Having met her wife at primary school in the Somerset village of Westbury-sub-Mendip, she married her in the local register office last year. She found the navy dress decorated with sunflowers for \u00a314 on the internet; it has seen outings to the dental laboratory (where she makes false teeth), as well as to a friend\u2019s wedding where she was \u201cbest man\u201d \u2013 she paired it with a black jacket to \u201cjazz it up a bit\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"afa059a11130cf27e3fdf67f60ea80177a2f97a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afa059a11130cf27e3fdf67f60ea80177a2f97a3/0_0_729_1694/430.jpg\" alt=\"Sanji wearing her wedding lehenga, which she has reworn\" width=\"430\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanji wearing her wedding lehenga, which she has reworn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image supplied by Sanji</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sanji, who married in 2017, has already reworn the lehenga (full ankle-length skirt) she wore then and plans to bring out her entire outfit later this month for a teej party, a traditional Nepali<strong> </strong>festival where women dress up, often in red.</p> <p>The single-use frock remains the rule rather than the exception \u2013 79% of women still buy theirs at a wedding dress specialist, according to the wedding planning app Bridebook \u2013 presumably making them less wearable after the ceremony. But, even here, there are attempts to improve sustainability, with brands such as Reformation and <a href=\"https://motherofpearl.co.uk/\">Mother of Pearl</a> using recycled fabrics and natural dyes. Secondhand gowns can be found everywhere from Oxfam to eBay, while <a href=\"https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/bridalwear-articles/wedding-dress-hire-where-to-rent-a-dress/\" title=\"\">companies that hire out wedding dresses</a>, such as the Bridal Gallery and Girl Meets Dress, are on the rise.</p> <p>It can\u2019t come too soon for the Dublin-based sustainability advocate Emma Gleeson. While much of the world is paring back in the name of the planet, she says, \u201cthe wedding thing seems to be getting more and more extreme\u201d. For evidence, see the growing trend for multiple wedding outfits, as worn by the Duchess of Sussex and the singer Solange Knowles. For her own wedding, Gleeson settled on a white dress with a pattern on it. Not only did she want something she could wear again, but she disliked much of the culture surrounding wedding dresses. \u201cI could see how bad my friends were made to feel by the shopping experience \u2013 people saying: \u2018Oh well, you\u2019ll be a size smaller by the time you wear this\u2019 \u2026 horrible things like that.\u201d</p> <p>Lesley Kazan-Pinfield was rejecting this kind of talk as long ago as 1980, when she wore a pair of homemade dungarees to get married at Truro register office. She continued to wear them until they fell apart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6b42b7c76b41deb459efe06e011175f8d37ea644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b42b7c76b41deb459efe06e011175f8d37ea644/134_126_654_1080/606.jpg\" alt=\"Lesley Kazan-Pinfield, pictured on her wedding day in her homemade dungarees.\" width=\"606\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lesley Kazan-Pinfield, pictured on her wedding day in her homemade dungarees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image supplied by Lesley Kazan-Pinfield</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other women find ways to recycle their dresses, beyond handing them down or selling them. It was only a week or two after her wedding in Burnley, 16 years ago, that Shaista got a call about a woman who lived in her mum\u2019s old neighbourhood in Pakistan. Her husband had just died. \u201cShe had three or four young children. In Pakistan, there\u2019s no welfare state, so Mum rang me saying: \u2018Can you contribute anything? I\u2019m having a whip-round.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Shaista decided to donate her wedding dress. When it made it to the woman, \u201cShe just burst into tears \u2013 she saw it as \u2018I\u2019m going to be less reliant\u2019\u201d than if she had just been given some one-off money. The woman began charging people to borrow it for the day; as Shaista describes it, it was \u201ca micro-business for her, a wedding dress for those who could never afford to buy\u201d.</p> <p>There are a number of charities that use old gowns for new purposes. When Georgia Keogh-Horgan got married in 2013 in a secondhand dress from eBay, she thought that it might be something a future child would be able to wear. Tragically, her son died just hours after birth, but she found a charity called <a href=\"https://www.cherishedgowns.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Cherished Gowns</a> that turned wedding dresses into funeral gowns for babies. \u201cI think my wedding dress has been made into 11 gowns and little nappies. Babies who are born very small don\u2019t always have nappies that fit,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen your baby dies, you still want to dress them normally \u2026 Little things like that are quite important.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"335f2ec5301a56d7e9658efbb9bf5ec56268f653\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/335f2ec5301a56d7e9658efbb9bf5ec56268f653/1_0_5330_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Funeral gowns for babies (right) made from Georgia Keogh-Horgan\u2019s wedding dress (left).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Funeral gowns for babies (right) made from Georgia Keogh-Horgan\u2019s wedding dress (left).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The repurposing of wedding outfits fits in with today\u2019s fashion for crafts \u2013 sales of sewing machines have risen, and YouTube is now full of tutorials on how to knit hats and darn socks.

      "bodyText": "Catherine O\u2019Nolan wears her wedding dress every year on her anniversary, regardless of where she is or what she is doing. That meant she once wore it on a ferry. She has also worn it to walk the dog on the beach near her home in Suffolk. She has eaten fish and chips in it, cut the grass in it, flown to Dublin in it. It\u2019s not just any old frock; made by the bridal specialist Jenny Packham, there is no mistaking what it is. Strangely, she says, nobody ever says a word. O\u2019Nolan is one of a number of women who refuse to consign their wedding dresses to the back of the wardrobe \u2013 whether by repurposing them, recycling them or simply reusing them as they are. Some are building in flexibility ahead of the wedding, opting for outfits that will transition smoothly from aisle or register office to boardroom or holiday. After all, single-use dresses are bad for the environment and the bank balance, with the average British wedding dress last year costing nearly \u00a31,400. Anita Gera was one of those who answered our call for stories about reusing wedding clothes. She got married in Copenhagen in 2006, and has continued to wear the constituent parts of her outfit \u2013 a tunic, trousers and dupatta (a long scarf) \u2013 to parties, although the marriage is now over. On a recent mini-cruise with her mum to Hamburg, a gala night provided an opportunity to wear the whole ensemble. It helps that it is bright red. \u201cI grew up in India,\u201d she explains, \u201cso, to me, white is the colour of funerals and red is the colour you wear for joyous occasions.\u201d While she wouldn\u2019t wear her outfit in India, she felt comfortable on the cruise ship: \u201cI know it\u2019s my wedding outfit but to most people it will just look like some glamorous Bollywood-style outfit.\u201d Sophie Pollard also bought an outfit she could wear again. Having met her wife at primary school in the Somerset village of Westbury-sub-Mendip, she married her in the local register office last year. She found the navy dress decorated with sunflowers for \u00a314 on the internet; it has seen outings to the dental laboratory (where she makes false teeth), as well as to a friend\u2019s wedding where she was \u201cbest man\u201d \u2013 she paired it with a black jacket to \u201cjazz it up a bit\u201d. Sanji, who married in 2017, has already reworn the lehenga (full ankle-length skirt) she wore then and plans to bring out her entire outfit later this month for a teej party, a traditional Nepali festival where women dress up, often in red. The single-use frock remains the rule rather than the exception \u2013 79% of women still buy theirs at a wedding dress specialist, according to the wedding planning app Bridebook \u2013 presumably making them less wearable after the ceremony. But, even here, there are attempts to improve sustainability, with brands such as Reformation and Mother of Pearl using recycled fabrics and natural dyes. Secondhand gowns can be found everywhere from Oxfam to eBay, while companies that hire out wedding dresses, such as the Bridal Gallery and Girl Meets Dress, are on the rise. It can\u2019t come too soon for the Dublin-based sustainability advocate Emma Gleeson. While much of the world is paring back in the name of the planet, she says, \u201cthe wedding thing seems to be getting more and more extreme\u201d. For evidence, see the growing trend for multiple wedding outfits, as worn by the Duchess of Sussex and the singer Solange Knowles. For her own wedding, Gleeson settled on a white dress with a pattern on it. Not only did she want something she could wear again, but she disliked much of the culture surrounding wedding dresses. \u201cI could see how bad my friends were made to feel by the shopping experience \u2013 people saying: \u2018Oh well, you\u2019ll be a size smaller by the time you wear this\u2019 \u2026 horrible things like that.\u201d Lesley Kazan-Pinfield was rejecting this kind of talk as long ago as 1980, when she wore a pair of homemade dungarees to get married at Truro register office. She continued to wear them until they fell apart. Other women find ways to recycle their dresses, beyond handing them down or selling them. It was only a week or two after her wedding in Burnley, 16 years ago, that Shaista got a call about a woman who lived in her mum\u2019s old neighbourhood in Pakistan. Her husband had just died. \u201cShe had three or four young children. In Pakistan, there\u2019s no welfare state, so Mum rang me saying: \u2018Can you contribute anything? I\u2019m having a whip-round.\u2019\u201d Shaista decided to donate her wedding dress. When it made it to the woman, \u201cShe just burst into tears \u2013 she saw it as \u2018I\u2019m going to be less reliant\u2019\u201d than if she had just been given some one-off money. The woman began charging people to borrow it for the day; as Shaista describes it, it was \u201ca micro-business for her, a wedding dress for those who could never afford to buy\u201d. There are a number of charities that use old gowns for new purposes. When Georgia Keogh-Horgan got married in 2013 in a secondhand dress from eBay, she thought that it might be something a future child would be able to wear. Tragically, her son died just hours after birth, but she found a charity called Cherished Gowns that turned wedding dresses into funeral gowns for babies. \u201cI think my wedding dress has been made into 11 gowns and little nappies. Babies who are born very small don\u2019t always have nappies that fit,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen your baby dies, you still want to dress them normally \u2026 Little things like that are quite important.\u201d The repurposing of wedding outfits fits in with today\u2019s fashion for crafts \u2013 sales of sewing machines have risen, and YouTube is now full of tutorials on how to knit hats and darn socks.

While it might not be a surprise that the studio made money this season, not many could have predicted just how <em>much</em> money it would make. With four $1bn-plus hits, Disney broke a new record and ensured that the industry survived another summer with their films accounting for 50% of the overall gross for the season. What\u2019s most important is that their successes come from three different strands (Marvel, live-action/CG remakes and Pixar) and while none of their hits are based on original properties, it\u2019s a sign of how the company has grown in the last decade.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/23/avengers-endgame-review-unconquerable-brilliance-takes-marvel-to-new-heights\">Avengers: Endgame</a>, the endlessly hyped concluding chapter in the Avengers franchise (for now, anyway) made even more money than anticipated with $2.796bn worldwide, edging away from Avatar to become the most successful film of all time. It was the ending that Marvel and Disney have been working toward for the last 11 years since the original Iron Man and together with pre-summer hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/05/captain-marvel-review-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson\">Captain Marvel</a> bringing in over $1bn, it shows that audiences are yet to grow fatigued.</p> <p>The underwhelming box office for March\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/26/dumbo-review-tim-burton-elephant-disney-thud\">Dumbo</a> might have concerned some higher ups at Disney given that 2019 would see three more live-action, or CG, spins on animated classics but comparisons are close to pointless given how the fanbase for the 1941 original isn\u2019t there in quite the same way as it is for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/11/the-lion-king-review-anthro-leonine-clones-original\">The Lion King</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/22/aladdin-review-live-action-remake-will-smith-guy-ritchie\">Aladdin</a>. Both were huge this summer, the former already the ninth biggest film of all time, and while a Maleficent sequel this October won\u2019t scale such heights, the practice remains hugely profitable (next year sees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/08/mulan-first-trailer-for-disney-live-action-reboot-released\">Mulan</a> aiming for more cash).</p> <p>Then finally, their standard summer Pixar offering hit harder than usual given that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/13/toy-story-4-review-new-characters-same-old-story-pixar\">Toy Story 4</a>, the latest in a franchise that had already made the studio $2bn in ticket sales alone. While the latest chapter seemed unnecessary as a concept, given how the third had ended with such operatic perfection, critics were still warm and so were audiences with the film just days away from becoming the biggest Toy Story to date globally. With Disney+ months away from potentially dominating the streaming market as well, the studio looks set for yet more happy ever afters.</p> <h2>Sleeper hits are hard to find</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"509608775c703b4a1a7b1381ea69d836e38359d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/509608775c703b4a1a7b1381ea69d836e38359d8/0_203_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever in Booksmart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever in Booksmart</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the summer season is most obviously associated with big hitters, it\u2019s also traditionally been a time for smaller films to shine, appealing to those weary of explosions. Past seasons have seen Julie &amp; Julia, Little Miss Sunshine, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Garden State, Napoleon Dynamite, The Blair Witch Project and The Big Sick all over-perform, buoyed more by word of mouth than aggressive, and expensive, marketing.</p> <p>But this year has been something of a bloodbath for lower rung titles, even those with name casts and wide releases. In January, a number of big acquisitions had experts suggesting that Sundance was regaining its position as a competitive marketplace for studios seeking crowd-pleasing sleepers with surprise megabucks deals for a number of titles. Cut to the summer however and execs might be regretting all that chequebook-flaunting with Amazon\u2019s $13m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/26/late-night-review-emma-thompson-mindy-kaling-sundance\">Late Night</a> failing to crack $16m in the US while New Line\u2019s $15m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/28/blinded-by-the-light-review-bruce-springsteen-inspires-sentimental-misfire\">Blinded by the Light</a> has yet to make it over $9m. The problem is that while both might have seemed commercial and audience-friendly in Park City, that\u2019s when surrounded by smaller, more opaque titles and with an eager inbuilt festival audience.

      "bodyText": "Disney remains in charge of the kingdom Finally some good news for those plucky young upstarts at Disney. While it might not be a surprise that the studio made money this season, not many could have predicted just how much money it would make. With four $1bn-plus hits, Disney broke a new record and ensured that the industry survived another summer with their films accounting for 50% of the overall gross for the season. What\u2019s most important is that their successes come from three different strands (Marvel, live-action/CG remakes and Pixar) and while none of their hits are based on original properties, it\u2019s a sign of how the company has grown in the last decade. Avengers: Endgame, the endlessly hyped concluding chapter in the Avengers franchise (for now, anyway) made even more money than anticipated with $2.796bn worldwide, edging away from Avatar to become the most successful film of all time. It was the ending that Marvel and Disney have been working toward for the last 11 years since the original Iron Man and together with pre-summer hit Captain Marvel bringing in over $1bn, it shows that audiences are yet to grow fatigued. The underwhelming box office for March\u2019s Dumbo might have concerned some higher ups at Disney given that 2019 would see three more live-action, or CG, spins on animated classics but comparisons are close to pointless given how the fanbase for the 1941 original isn\u2019t there in quite the same way as it is for The Lion King and Aladdin. Both were huge this summer, the former already the ninth biggest film of all time, and while a Maleficent sequel this October won\u2019t scale such heights, the practice remains hugely profitable (next year sees Mulan aiming for more cash). Then finally, their standard summer Pixar offering hit harder than usual given that it was Toy Story 4, the latest in a franchise that had already made the studio $2bn in ticket sales alone. While the latest chapter seemed unnecessary as a concept, given how the third had ended with such operatic perfection, critics were still warm and so were audiences with the film just days away from becoming the biggest Toy Story to date globally. With Disney+ months away from potentially dominating the streaming market as well, the studio looks set for yet more happy ever afters. Sleeper hits are hard to find While the summer season is most obviously associated with big hitters, it\u2019s also traditionally been a time for smaller films to shine, appealing to those weary of explosions. Past seasons have seen Julie &amp; Julia, Little Miss Sunshine, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Garden State, Napoleon Dynamite, The Blair Witch Project and The Big Sick all over-perform, buoyed more by word of mouth than aggressive, and expensive, marketing. But this year has been something of a bloodbath for lower rung titles, even those with name casts and wide releases. In January, a number of big acquisitions had experts suggesting that Sundance was regaining its position as a competitive marketplace for studios seeking crowd-pleasing sleepers with surprise megabucks deals for a number of titles. Cut to the summer however and execs might be regretting all that chequebook-flaunting with Amazon\u2019s $13m Late Night failing to crack $16m in the US while New Line\u2019s $15m Blinded by the Light has yet to make it over $9m. The problem is that while both might have seemed commercial and audience-friendly in Park City, that\u2019s when surrounded by smaller, more opaque titles and with an eager inbuilt festival audience. Getting a wider public to get out and see films about diversity in a late night writers room and a Bruce Springsteen-soundtracked coming-of-age story in 80s Luton is an entirely different prospect. Elsewhere, Sundance hit The Last Black Man in San Francisco couldn\u2019t break $5m, Diane Keaton wasn\u2019t able to turn Poms into another Book Club-level hit despite similar release dates, commercially-leaning music indies Teen Spirit and Wild Rose couldn\u2019t crack $3m between them, Where\u2019d You Go Bernadette\u2019s bad buzz translated into bad BO, Jim Jarmsuch\u2019s starry zombie comedy The Dead Don\u2019t Die died and Booksmart\u2019s critical adoration didn\u2019t impress audiences who mostly shunned it despite a bold wide release strategy. There was some decent news for Sundance purchase The Farewell which is almost up to $15m (but losing financial steam), a solid number but given the film\u2019s reviews and commercial appeal, it\u2019s not the slam-dunk distributor A24 would have hoped for. The dog days of summer did finally throw up something close to a sleeper in Good Boys, the first R-rated comedy to make it to number one since The Boss in 2016, although its $21m opening is a far cry from previous comedy hits of summers past such as The Hangover ($44m), Girls Trip ($31m) and Central Intelligence ($35m). Its mild success, especially compared to other so-called original films of the summer, shows that ribald humour and an easy-to-sell concept (kids being rude) attracts audiences more than festival acclaim and big stars at least during the warmer months. Never underestimate 90s movie stars Articles mourning the death of the movie star have been circulating for years now thanks to the increased power of franchises making star-led projects less desirable to audiences. In the last 12 months, we\u2019ve seen flops from Matthew McConaughey, Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Steve Carell and Will Ferrell leading many to question whether any name alone was enough to open a movie. The record success of this summer\u2019s Murder Mystery on Netflix showcased the sustained appeal of 90s stalwarts Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston but given the low involvement of a streaming watch, it only really equalled that of say the cast of Big Little Lies or any other TV series boasting A-list talent. But this summer saw two major box office hits that relied almost exclusively on star power.

      "bodyText": "Put your cellphone away. Stop texting. Stop using the camera as a mirror. Stop looking at Instagram. They\u2019re the familiar commands of teachers and educators in the age of the smartphone. Most teenagers today have grown up never knowing a world without smartphones, with the Pew Research Center reporting that 95% of all teens currently have access to or own a smartphone, and 45% are online almost constantly. That leaves educators the daunting challenge of teaching those whose attentions are \u2013 at least partially \u2013 attached to the devices in their pockets. Most schools have put in place policies banning or regulating phone usage during school hours, and teachers now routinely find themselves confiscating devices or writing up students for being on their phones. Educators are now exploring more drastic measures. This school year, more than 1,000 schools nationwide will be using Yondr, a pouch system that allows students to lock away their phones while they\u2019re in class. Each morning when students arrive at school, they magnetically lock their devices into their own personal green and gray pouches. They maintain possession of their pouches and devices, but they cannot unlock it until the end of the day, when they tap it on an unlocking magnet station located throughout the school. The concept is not new. Musicians and performers have been using Yondr to prevent people from filming their gigs since the San Francisco-based company launched in 2014. But in recent years, more and more schools have begun using the pouches to keep kids off their phones during school hours, with dozens in the Bay Area alone. \u201cDemand has tripled this year,\u201d the Yondr spokeswoman Kelly Taylor said.

      "bodyText": "Virgin Australia has announced it is cutting 750 corporate and head office jobs as part of a restructuring plan forced on the struggling airline that will also include the axing of uneconomic routes. After posting a \u201cdisappointing\u201d full-year loss of $349.1m on Wednesday, Virgin said the \u201cchallenging trading environment\u201d had been compounded by headwinds such as increased fuel prices and the weak Australian dollar. \u201cThere is no doubt that we are operating in a tough economic climate with high fuel, a low Australian dollar and subdued trading conditions,\u201d Virgin Australia chief executive Paul Scurrah said. The group, which includes the budget carrier Tigerair, will undergo what Scurrah called a \u201crightsizing\u201d program which would see 750 jobs cut from the total of around 10,000 employees. The majority of job losses look set to be borne by staff at the airline\u2019s headquarters in Brisbane. Although revenue for the 12 months to 30 June rose 7.5% to $5.83bn as it added passengers, it was not enough to prevent the group recording its seventh consecutive year of losses. Movements in the fuel price and the Australian dollar cost the company $158.8m. Its international business went into the red by $58.3m after heavy investment in new routes to New Zealand and Hong Kong. It has not declared a final dividend. Shares in Virgin fell 3% on Wednesday to 16c, their lowest for 10 years. Scurrah said that demand had been \u201csoft\u201d in the second half of the financial year, a problem also noted by Qantas boss Alan Joyce when he posted weaker results last week in the face of a broad slowdown in consumer spending across Australia. \u201cMarket demand moderated in the second half of the financial year [to June],\u201d Scurrah said on Wednesday, \u201cimpacted by the timing of the Easter holiday period and the federal election, which saw both the corporate and leisure travel sections soften.\u201d Demand had continued to be weak in July, he said. \u201cDecisions which have a direct impact on people\u2019s livelihoods are never made lightly, and I regret the need to reduce the size of our workforce so quickly,\u201d Scurrah said. \u201cHowever, today\u2019s financial results tell us loud and clear that we need to reduce costs.\u201d The airline\u2019s restucturing, which aims to save $75m a year, includes a shakeup of the top executive team involving the departure of the chief financial officer, chief operations officer and chief commercial officer. The boss of Tigerair, Merren McArthur, will also leave the company as her role will disappear under the changes. The airline\u2019s three distinct parts \u2013 Virgin Australia, Virgin Australia Regional Airlines and Tigerair \u2013 will have their operations merged under the restructure, although the brands will survive. Scurrah said he had been reviewing the group\u2019s \u201coverly complex\u201d structure since taking over as chief executive in March and hoped that the streamlined management team would deliver \u201cbetter financial outcomes for the group\u201d. The airline was still \u201cin the process of a detailed review\u201d of its fleet and network and it was likely that underperforming routes would be axed. \u201cThe group intends to further reduce flying across elements of its short-haul international and domestic network to meet demand and maximise route profitability,\u201d the airline said. Adrian Schofield, an editor at Aviation Week, said Virgin was experiencing the negative effects of a downturn in passenger demand that had also caused problems for Qantas and Air New Zealand. \u201cThere are indications that the industry is seeing a downturn and Virgin has run into that,\u201d he said. \u201cAviation is really cyclical so it\u2019s important to look at the industry as a whole and we\u2019re definitely seeing signs of weakness.\u201d",

But such reactors typically generate more than 1,000 megawatts and very few countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the capacity to distribute that amount of power. Rosatom said its reactors for export were not limited to those over 1,000 megawatts capacity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2e3246e177cfb27e456ee24bec9cd5638c48256f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e3246e177cfb27e456ee24bec9cd5638c48256f/1317_0_2668_3335/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Rosatom stand at the 2018 Atomexpo international nuclear industry forum in Sochi.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rosatom stand at the 2018 Atomexpo international nuclear industry forum in Sochi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Artur Lebedev/Tass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a rule of thumb in the industry is that no single facility should provide more than 10% of the total of a country\u2019s power. Only Nigeria and South Africa comply with this recommendation.</p> <p>Nuclear power\u2019s supporters argue that the lengthy construction times of nuclear reactors allow poorer countries to build up their infrastructure. But N\u00e9vine Schepers, a nuclear expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, said third generation light-water technology was not suited to many African countries.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of economic sense smaller countries that have a long way to go to develop their grids would be better off aiming for something like smaller modular reactors,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Technology for reactors that would require smaller initial capital investment and produce about 300MW is being developed in Russia, China and the US. Rosatom said its RITM-200 series reactor, a small modular reactor, was already installed on Russian ice-breakers. The first land-based nuclear plants with RITM reactors were expected in Russia in 2027, about the same time nuclear infrastructure, such as a regulatory framework, for sub-Saharan African countries could be expected.</p> <p>\u201cDespite the shortcomings of the grid infrastructure in Africa, the latest generation of tried and tested \u2018large\u2019 [reactors] are still the clear winners in most regions in terms of the cost of electricity,\u201d Rosatom said in a statement. It added that it sought to provide a \u201ccustomised solution\u201d for each country.</p> <p>Another concern is that the expensive projects favoured by Rosatom would not benefit Africa\u2019s poorest people. In most countries energy is generated in large, centralised plants and distributed over a national grid \u2013 a model that would be reinforced in Africa by nuclear power.</p> <p>\u201cAccess to energy is a basic human right and necessary for a dignified life. The majority of those denied this right live in Africa,\u201d said Friends of the Earth. \u201cHowever, the expansion of profit-driven nuclear energy in Africa would only exacerbate the problem.\u201d</p> <p>The environmental NGO said the answer to Africa\u2019s energy needs lay in \u201cefficient technology that meets the daily needs of people, in the hands of communities and municipalities, and controlled democratically\u201d. Only small-scale and interconnected grids that were democratically managed could deliver energy sovereignty to African people, it added.</p> <p>Rosatom has accused Friends of the Earth and other NGOs of \u201chardline anti-nuclear activism \u2026 based on a position well known for being completely biased and riddled with factual errors\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Russia is attempting to gain influence in Africa and earn billions of pounds by selling developing nations nuclear technology that critics say is unsuitable and unlikely to benefit the continent\u2019s poorest people. Representatives of Rosatom, the Russian state corporation involved with both the military and civil use of nuclear energy, have approached the leaders of dozens of African countries in the past two years. The company, which is building a $29bn plant for Egypt, has worked within the framework of agreements made by the Russian government with Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, South Africa and others. Nigeria has a deal with Rosatom for the construction of a nuclear reactor, and less ambitious agreements of cooperation have been signed with Sudan, Ethiopia and the Republic of the Congo. Russia has also set up an offices to promote nuclear energy in Zambia, with well-funded outreach campaigns designed to drum up enthusiasm. Winners of an Africa-wide competition were rewarded with an \u201ceducational\u201d trip to Russia that included visits to a nuclear power plant and the \u201cscience city\u201d of Obninsk. A typical package offered to a nation interested in nuclear power includes generous loans and long-term supply contracts. Russia has lent Egypt 85% of the construction cost for its nuclear reactor. Rosatom trains local specialists in nuclear physics and energy in several African nations, and runs a scholarship programme in Kenya. Rosatom is among international groups that are exporting light-water technology, which is generally considered among the safest, and is building a $13bn light-water- reactor plant in Bangladesh. But such reactors typically generate more than 1,000 megawatts and very few countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the capacity to distribute that amount of power. Rosatom said its reactors for export were not limited to those over 1,000 megawatts capacity. It is a rule of thumb in the industry is that no single facility should provide more than 10% of the total of a country\u2019s power. Only Nigeria and South Africa comply with this recommendation. Nuclear power\u2019s supporters argue that the lengthy construction times of nuclear reactors allow poorer countries to build up their infrastructure. But N\u00e9vine Schepers, a nuclear expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, said third generation light-water technology was not suited to many African countries. \u201cIn terms of economic sense smaller countries that have a long way to go to develop their grids would be better off aiming for something like smaller modular reactors,\u201d she said. Technology for reactors that would require smaller initial capital investment and produce about 300MW is being developed in Russia, China and the US. Rosatom said its RITM-200 series reactor, a small modular reactor, was already installed on Russian ice-breakers. The first land-based nuclear plants with RITM reactors were expected in Russia in 2027, about the same time nuclear infrastructure, such as a regulatory framework, for sub-Saharan African countries could be expected. \u201cDespite the shortcomings of the grid infrastructure in Africa, the latest generation of tried and tested \u2018large\u2019 [reactors] are still the clear winners in most regions in terms of the cost of electricity,\u201d Rosatom said in a statement. It added that it sought to provide a \u201ccustomised solution\u201d for each country. Another concern is that the expensive projects favoured by Rosatom would not benefit Africa\u2019s poorest people. In most countries energy is generated in large, centralised plants and distributed over a national grid \u2013 a model that would be reinforced in Africa by nuclear power. \u201cAccess to energy is a basic human right and necessary for a dignified life. The majority of those denied this right live in Africa,\u201d said Friends of the Earth. \u201cHowever, the expansion of profit-driven nuclear energy in Africa would only exacerbate the problem.\u201d The environmental NGO said the answer to Africa\u2019s energy needs lay in \u201cefficient technology that meets the daily needs of people, in the hands of communities and municipalities, and controlled democratically\u201d. Only small-scale and interconnected grids that were democratically managed could deliver energy sovereignty to African people, it added. Rosatom has accused Friends of the Earth and other NGOs of \u201chardline anti-nuclear activism \u2026 based on a position well known for being completely biased and riddled with factual errors\u201d. It said its priority was \u201csustainable development\u201d and that nuclear energy was \u201cintrinsically immune to any form of political manipulation\u201d. Rosatom said economic benefits of nuclear power amounted to four times the upfront construction costs of plants. Nuclear power brought high-skilled jobs and enabled benefits such as desalination, nuclear medicine and improved agriculture. Experts pointed out that no nuclear projects have been finished and only two contracts \u2013 in Egypt and Nigeria \u2013 are in place. \u201cThese projects are far into the future, but Russia and Rosatom have been actively wooing African states,\u201d said Schepers. \u201cIt is very profitable for them [because it] creates jobs at home and a decades-long relationships.\u201d Selling nuclear technology is part of an effort by Russia to build influence, power and trade across Africa, with growing involvement in nations across the continent. The involvement of Russian mercenaries in the Central African Republic and Sudan has attracted significant attention, as has an apparent effort to influence elections in South Africa in May. Many of the African countries that have signed commercial agreements of the kind being pursued by Rosatom are run by movements or individuals who have long-standing relationships with Russia or \u2013 more often \u2013 the USSR. In early April Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, the president of Angola, visited Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin and top officials, to discuss arms sales, diamond mining, and gas and oil production. Russia delivered six Su-30K fighter jets to Angola this year and two more are expected in the second part of a billion-dollar deal. Louren\u00e7, who fought in Angola\u2019s war of independence against Portugal, studied in Moscow from 1978 to 1982. Angola was a cold-war battleground and the USSR backed the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, still the ruling party. Rosatom said it had signed no contracts with Angola and it had no presence there. Alex Vines, head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, said \u201creactivating old Soviet networks\u201d had been a clear strategy in Moscow for a couple of years. \u201cThe old history can play very positively in some places.\u201d Patrick Smith, editor of Africa Confidential, an investigative newsletter, said: \u201cRussians can\u2019t write big cheques but have mastered the art of making themselves really popular, albeit with some of the worst leaders in Africa. They want the ties too. The more powers they can play off against each other, the better.\u201d The campaign has had setbacks. A deal in South Africa went wrong when Jacob Zuma was removed from power amid corruption allegations last year. A furore surrounding a $75bn contract to build power stations with a combined 9.6 gigawatt output badly damaged the image of Russia. \u201cSouth Africa was a very good example of where [the Russians] overplayed their hand and misread local sentiments. It has set them back there by years,\u201d said Nataliya Bugayova from the Institute for the Study of War in Washington DC. \u201cPart of their pitch is that they can support a regime with relatively few strings attached. I don\u2019t think the overall wellbeing of the African states is driving the Russian campaign, whether nuclear or anything else.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 and 12 September 2019 to clarify some technical references and add further responses by Rosatom.",

      "bodyText": "The New Zealand government has banned tourists from swimming with bottlenose dolphins in an attempt to save the struggling species. According to the department of conservation [DoC] research has shown that humans were \u201cloving the dolphins too much\u201d and human interaction was \u201chaving a signifiant impact on the population\u2019s resting and feeding behaviour\u201d. The ban on swimming with bottlenose dolphins applies to tour operators in the North Island\u2019s Bay of Islands region, which is popular with tourists for its warm climate and golden beaches. Other dolphin tours that interact with different species of dolphin in other parts of the country are still permitted. Bottlenose dolphins prefer to swim in coastal regions, making them vulnerable to human activity, and their numbers in the Bay of Islands have declined by 66% since 1990, according to DoC. A core group of only 19 bottlenose dolphins visit the region regularly now, and the latest reports show a 75% mortality rate among their calves \u2013 the highest seen both in New Zealand, internationally and in captivity. Alongside banning tourist swims with bottlenose dolphins, DoC have stipulated that tour operators may interact with the dolphins only for periods of 20 minutes (reduced from 30 minutes) at a time, and all tour operators will be restricted to visiting either morning or afternoon, in order to provide a block of time where the dolphins are left alone. The possibility of creating a marine mammal sanctuary in the Bay of Islands is also being investigated by DoC, research partners and local M\u0101ori tribes. Tour operators in the Bay of Plenty have raised concerns about the impact the new ban will have on tourism numbers, and said less tour operators on the water will mean fewer eyes watching out for how private boats interact with the vulnerable population. Tourists can still swim with common or dusky dolphins in tours operated in the South Island.",

About the same time, Stone stepped down from the Impellam board.</p> <p>Stone and Adamson declined to comment on why they had fallen out with Ashcroft, but documents show that by the time Anne Street went into administration it owed Stone as much as $1.3m and Adamson $1.14m.</p> <p>With Adamson demanding his money, and Mayfair refusing to advance any more funds, the loss-making Anne Street was put into administration on 8 August last year under Marcus Ayres of Ernst &amp; Young.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is understood Adamson made a complaint to Asic but the regulator decided against taking any action</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the point of its collapse, Anne Street owed about $145m to staff and creditors \u2013 mostly to other parts of the Anne Street group \u2013 but had assets of just $12m, a report of the company\u2019s affairs shows. Its debts included almost $18m owed to Mayfair, back in Belize. On top of that it owed about $2m to another Belize company, Nova Global.</p> <p>Nova Global\u2019s position as a secured creditor made it a key player in the fate of Anne Street because, if it didn\u2019t like how things were going, it always had the right to call in a receiver and take control of the process.</p> <p>It is believed to be linked to Mayfair and was represented during the administration by the law firm that looked after Ashcroft\u2019s interests.</p> <p>The key to bringing Anne Street back to life was a new company, also owned by Mayfair. This new company agreed to take on responsibility for all of Anne Street\u2019s staff, and pay suppliers who were owed about $1m. It would also take on responsibility for $7.8m owed to Mayfair.

      "bodyText": "Two Australian businesses owned by the Tory peer and former Australian Liberal party donor Michael Ashcroft have collapsed in the space of a year with debts totalling almost $150m, raising questions about their demise and \u2013 in one case \u2013 the means used to bring it back to life. The financial services group Anne Street Partners and the house builder QNV Constructions were put into administration after falling into difficulty over the past 12 months. But the nature of the resurrection of Anne Street from failed firm to going concern has angered its former chief executive, who alleges it involved a transaction \u201ctainted by fraud\u201d. The transaction \u2013 reluctantly agreed to by the administrator \u2013 has left the ex-CEO more than $1m out of pocket. Meanwhile up to 100 customers of QNV Constructions, which collapsed this month, are waiting for a restructuring proposal \u2013 as are unpaid subcontractors and suppliers, who are owed about $2.5m. It has also emerged that a director of QNV, Chris Eaton, has been described by a court (in relation to a different business) as \u201ca knowing participant in a dishonest and fraudulent design\u201d who lied to a business partner. There is no suggestion that Lord Ashcroft, who owns Anne Street and QNV through a company based in Belize called Mayfair, has done anything wrong. Ashcroft, an extremely successful businessman who has donated more than \u00a35m to the British Conservative party and $1.5m to Australia\u2019s Liberal party \u2013 including $1m donated in 2004 at the request of the then party president, Shane Stone \u2013 has been a controversial figure in the UK over his residency in Belize and his use of offshore financial vehicles. His best-known Australian venture is Anne Street, which he acquired in 2010 after it ran into strife under its founder, the alleged fraudster Craig Gore. Gore, a two-time bankrupt described by one judge as \u201ca rapacious Gold Coast property developer with grandiose plans\u201d, is due to stand trial next month on fraud charges after the corporate regulator accused him of filching $800,000 from investors. At its peak, Anne Street is understood to have employed about 300 people and was a one-stop shop financial services firm, offering customers financial advice, legal advice, tax accounting, home loans and real estate agency services. Sources say it also acted as QNV\u2019s \u201cbig sister\u201d, receiving fees from the construction company in return for services including payroll processing, office furniture and referrals to build houses. But it came under financial pressure owing to the damage to its core service, financial advice, inflicted by a wave of scandals engulfing the industry at large. Until 2017 its chief executive was the Queensland lawyer Michael Adamson and its directors included Stone, the former Northern Territory chief minister and Liberal party heavyweight. Stone has long been close to Ashcroft \u2013 for many years he served as deputy chairman under the peer at Impellam, a large staffing company listed on London\u2019s secondary stock exchange that also operates in Australia. But Adamson is believed to have handed in his notice in December 2016 and both he and Stone quit as directors of Anne Street late the following year. About the same time, Stone stepped down from the Impellam board. Stone and Adamson declined to comment on why they had fallen out with Ashcroft, but documents show that by the time Anne Street went into administration it owed Stone as much as $1.3m and Adamson $1.14m. With Adamson demanding his money, and Mayfair refusing to advance any more funds, the loss-making Anne Street was put into administration on 8 August last year under Marcus Ayres of Ernst &amp; Young. At the point of its collapse, Anne Street owed about $145m to staff and creditors \u2013 mostly to other parts of the Anne Street group \u2013 but had assets of just $12m, a report of the company\u2019s affairs shows. Its debts included almost $18m owed to Mayfair, back in Belize. On top of that it owed about $2m to another Belize company, Nova Global. Nova Global\u2019s position as a secured creditor made it a key player in the fate of Anne Street because, if it didn\u2019t like how things were going, it always had the right to call in a receiver and take control of the process. It is believed to be linked to Mayfair and was represented during the administration by the law firm that looked after Ashcroft\u2019s interests. The key to bringing Anne Street back to life was a new company, also owned by Mayfair. This new company agreed to take on responsibility for all of Anne Street\u2019s staff, and pay suppliers who were owed about $1m. It would also take on responsibility for $7.8m owed to Mayfair. Nova, meanwhile, agreed not to pursue Anne Street over the money it was owed. Ayres, the administrator, said he was unhappy with the proposal. \u201cThere\u2019s a transaction to switch across to a related party and you want me to sprinkle holy water on it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deal that was put on the table put me in quite an uncomfortable position for quite a while.\u201d He told Guardian Australia he had tried to push for a better deal but had \u201cvery limited cards to play\u201d and had recommended the transaction as the best available at the time. \u201cI\u2019m surprised even Lord Ashcroft bought it,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked at the budgets going forward and they were very, very optimistic.\u201d Minutes of creditors\u2019 meetings show that Adamson had threatened to report the alleged \u201cpresence of illegal phoenix activity in relation to the sale proposal\u201d to the corporate regulator. He \u201cstated that his concern was that there was a real risk that the sale of business was tainted by fraud, specifically so far as an attempt to defraud certain creditors\u201d. It is understood Adamson made a complaint to Asic but the regulator decided against taking any action. Stone and Adamson were also directors of QNV, but quit in 2017 about the same time they departed Anne Street. Eaton was appointed a director in late October 2017. This came a month after a Queensland court found he was \u201ca knowing participant in a dishonest and fraudulent design\u201d in a dispute over $125,000 reaped from a property development joint venture he used for unrelated expenses, including making repayments on his home loan. The district court judge Kiernan Dorney said Eaton had deliberately obstructed efforts by his partner in the venture to recover money from him. While giving evidence Eaton also admitted he had lied to his business partner about the project\u2019s progress. He had not responded to messages left on his mobile phone answering service and sent by text. Since December QNV has been relying on credit advanced by another offshore company with Nova in the name, Nova Global Overseas, which gives an address in the British Virgin Islands. It is believed to be another finance vehicle connected to Ashcroft and loan documents obtained by the Guardian show it agreed to lend QNV about $1.4m. The loan documents name Andrew Ashcroft, who sources say is Michael Ashcroft\u2019s son, as the company\u2019s sole director. Despite the support QNV\u2019s Queensland building licence was suspended in January after it failed to pay subcontractors and suppliers more than $174,000. In May New South Wales authorities cancelled QNV\u2019s registration there because the company did not have a qualified building supervisor, although the ticket was later restored. Internal financial records obtained by the Guardian show that since March QNV\u2019s Victorian division had also struggled to pay suppliers. Ashcroft could not be reached for comment. Both he and his associate Ian Robinson did not respond to emails sent to their last known addresses. Homebuyers and creditors met on 16 August to discuss QNV\u2019s fate and are waiting for a deal to resuscitate the group, known as a deed of company arrangement, to be proposed by one of the parties apparently connected to Ashcroft. One homebuyer, Peta Armstrong, said she hoped the collapse would bring to an end a fight with QNV over the $259,000 new home it built for her family just north of Newcastle in NSW that has been running for more than a year. Armstrong said that at one point she and her partner, James Reid, had become so desperate they even broke into the house and left their son to protect the property in case unpaid tradespeople came back to the site to take things away. \u201cHe stayed here alone for two weeks, just him and the cockroaches,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a whole lot of heartache and I look back on it now and say thank God it\u2019s over.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The latest national education test results show the writing skills of year 7 and 9 students have gone backwards over the past decade, with experts saying more needs to be done to assist struggling high school students. Preliminary results from this year\u2019s Naplan tests, which cover reading, writing, spelling, grammar and punctuation, as well as numeracy, were released on Wednesday. While the performance of primary school students was above the 2008 average in many areas, the improvements were not seen in secondary school. Victoria\u2019s education minister James Merlino has announced a special principal advisory committee to look at ways to improve the relevance of Naplan for year 9 students. One idea on the table is a proficiency certificate based on student reading and numeracy results that would guide subject selection for year 11 and 12. Students in year 9 around the country in both government and non-government schools experienced similar flat results and year 9 has long been considered the hardest cohort to engage in education, Merlino said. \u201cThese results don\u2019t reflect what students are capable of and we must investigate options to ensure our year 9 students are more engaged. This is about making the test more relevant, not adding unnecessary stress to Naplan,\u201d Merlino said. But educational experts were sceptical of that approach. Grattan Institute school education program director Peter Goss said the focus should be on building better foundations in earlier years. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to change direction on a super tanker, it takes a very long time and \u2026 happens very slowly,\u201d Goss said. \u201cOnce you fall behind it is hard to catch up.\u201d He said more support was needed to help kids with the transition from primary school to high school. \u201cIn year 7 a third of the kids might still be in that learning-to-read stage and yet they are expected to start covering more and more content. Secondary school teachers are not specialists in teaching kids how to read,\u201d Goss said. University of Sydney education expert Rachel Wilson agreed more effort needed to go into helping struggling students catch up before they got to high school. \u201cIf those students haven\u2019t been well supported through their primary school education and haven\u2019t been given the fundamentals \u2026 they feel like shrugging their shoulders, holding up their hands and saying \u2018I\u2019ve had it, that\u2019s it for me,\u2019\u201d she said. Acara chief executive David de Carvalho said schoolchildren had generally improved their writing skills from the 2018 results. \u201cStudents are to be congratulated for this year\u2019s improvement, especially year three students, where the results are particularly encouraging,\u201d he said. But students in years 7 and 9 performed below the 2011 baseline for writing. Compared with the 2008 average, students performed better for year 5 numeracy, years 3 and 5 reading, years 3 and 5 spelling, and year 3 grammar. The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, said state and territory governments should give greater autonomy to principals, and urged parents to play a greater role through bodies such as school councils. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re decluttering the curriculum so teachers can teach in the classroom,\u201d Tehan told the ABC. The standardised national tests have long been a source of controversy in the education sector, with former New South Wales education minister, Rob Stokes, among its prominent critics. Stokes said last year the program encouraged teachers to \u201cteach to the test\u201d, had fuelled \u201cedu-businesses\u201d and was limited in its usefulness. This year was the second time some of the tests were taken online, an option taken up by about half of the nation\u2019s schools. But the system was plagued by technical issues, with some students losing connectivity and others unable to log in at all. Affected students were able to resit the tests but the issue resulted in a disclaimer on the preliminary results warning they should be \u201cinterpreted with care\u201d. Acara believed the pen and paper test results were comparable with the online versions. However, Australian Education Union acting president Meredith Peace said teachers and principals shouldn\u2019t trust the results as they were \u201cso seriously compromised\u201d. \u201cThere is no transparency about how Acara have arrived at the results data published today, and the community must seriously question just how rigorous the independent assessment of the Naplan results were,\u201d she said. Deakin University education experts also warned the test results could not be fully relied upon, arguing the technical glitches had weakened Naplan\u2019s aim of providing comparable results. The federal Labor education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said the government had failed to reverse declines in reading, writing and maths. \u201cKids need to know the basics. It\u2019s the foundation of the rest of their education. We can\u2019t afford for the next generation to be held back,\u201d she said. A complete transition to online testing has been pushed back to 2021 because of this year\u2019s issues. A report on the underlying causes of the technical disruptions is due to soon be handed to the nation\u2019s education ministers.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales Natural Resources Commission has warned the water minister she is \u201cshooting the messenger\u201d over their findings that water management in the Barwon-Darling river had brought on drought conditions in the Lower Darling three years early. The Sydney Morning Herald has obtained correspondence from the commission in which it strongly refutes the minister\u2019s assertions that its report on management of NSW\u2019s largest river was wrong or tarnished by a conflict of interest by its scientific expert, Professor Fran Sheldon. \u201cNever in my time as commissioner have I been publicly criticised by a minister for the quality or process of our work,\u201d the chair of the commission, John Keniry wrote in the letter sent to Melinda Pavey, planning minister Rob Stokes and environment minister Matt Kean. \u201cI fear you minister are \u2018shooting the messenger\u2019 for the failures of the 2012 water-sharing plan,\u201d Keniry wrote. The NRC has recommended that the new rules for the Barwon-Darling should raise the cease-to-pump threshold, which would limited the ability of irrigators to pump when the river is low. The NSW Nationals and senior Liberals responsible for the environment are increasingly in conflict over issues that that the Nationals see as crucial for rural communities. Pavey told the Sydney Morning Herald: \u201cThis is not personal, it is a matter that carries the weight of government decisions which impacts communities and could cost the taxpayer millions of dollars,\u201d she said. The proposed new rules would have significant impacts for cotton growers around Brewarrina and Bourke, and would likely trigger calls for compensation. The federal government has proposed buying out A-class licences to reduce the extraction demands. In the case of the Barwon-Darling water-sharing plan, the lion\u2019s share of water entitlements are held by a handful of major agribusinesses that grow cotton. But the same rules have deeply angered graziers in the Lower Darling where the river has ceased to flow. In earlier correspondence, Pavey had slammed the conduct of the NRC, suggesting it had left itself open to conflicts of interest because Sheldon had been peer-reviewed by scientists she had worked with over the years. She also said Sheldon had not used the latest driver management data. In her letter to Keniry on Sunday, Pavey wrote she was \u201cseeking a re-evaluation of the data and processes that were undertaken to inform the draft report of the Barwon-Darling ... plan\u201d. She also asked WaterNSW to produce a rapid alternative analysis. The Barwon-Darling water-sharing plan includes controversial rules on when irrigators can pump during low flows and rules that allow irrigators to take up to 300% of their entitlement in one year if they have sufficient credit in their water accounts. This has led to irrigators being able to take large amounts of water out of river into private storages in the leadup to the drought. Guardian Australia has reported that the previous National party water minister Katrina Hodgkinson made these late changes to the plan after it had been signed off by her department and after public exhibition. The NRC found that the high level of extractions had led to the Lower Darling going into hydrological drought three years early. Other independent reviews have also expressed concerns about the Barwon-Darling water-sharing plan. The Murray-Darling Basin water compliance review by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority found the Barwon-Darling water-sharing plan failed to \u201cprovide adequate protection for environmental water, particularly during low flows\u201d, potentially inhibiting achievement of the environmental and social outcomes of the basin plan. The rules were also criticised in the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin royal commission report, which found \u201cthe amendments made in October 2012 to the NSW Barwon-Darling water-sharing plan have almost certainly contributed to decreased flows south of Bourke, and an increase in no-flow events, and their duration\u201d. The Vertessy report was commissioned by the federal government after last summer\u2019s fish kills found that \u201cchanges to Barwon\u2013Darling water access arrangements made by NSW just prior to the commencement of the basin plan in 2012 have enhanced the ability of irrigators to access water during low flow periods and during the first flow event immediately after a cease-to-flow period\u201d. \u201cWhilst we would not assert that excessive water extractions caused the lower Darling fish deaths in 2018-19 per se, it is clear that historic patterns of extractions in the northern basin over the last two decades (and particularly since 2012) have reduced the resilience of riverine ecosystems in the lower Darling \u2026 As such, water access and water sharing arrangements in the Barwon\u2013Darling should be reviewed and modified.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners are setting their sights on New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland after Victoria passed a new law to allow trans and gender-diverse people to change their recorded sex on their birth certificates on Tuesday, following a heated debate. Despite some reservations from independent members of parliament, the Victorian legislative council overwhelmingly voted in favour of the bill, 26 to 14 on Tuesday night. The Liberals opposed the legislation, with one MP claiming it would lead to women and girls being molested. Supporters of the bill denounced such rhetoric as desperate, nonsensical and \u201cextremely hurtful\u201d. The bill requires the person making the application to make a statutory declaration when nominating the sex to be recorded, and must include a statement from an adult who has known them for 12 months or more who believes the application is being made in good faith and supports the change. The legislation passed the legislative council without amendment after a majority of independent members sided with the government to pass the bill. The new law came after what MPs described as some of the most intense campaigning in the state, with MPs saying they had received hundreds of emails from those in favour and those opposed to the legislation. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A new women\u2019s group, Victorian Women\u2019s Guild, was spawned in opposition to the legislation on the grounds of the potential impact it would have on women-only spaces, while Equality Australia responded with an open letter of over 1,000 feminists supporting the change. Legal director of Equality Australia, Lee Carnie, told Guardian Australia that other states that had yet to change the law would now be the focus for campaigners. \u201cWA, Queensland and NSW are next in line for birth certificate reform,\u201d she said. \u201cEquality Australia will be working with trans advocates from across those states for fair birth certificates.\u201d Liberals opposed the legislation, with the conservative Liberal MP Bernie Finn stating it would put his daughters in danger .

Life \u2013 human life \u2013 was observed and accepted in all its wondrous diversity in these communities, but not in all,\u201d he said. Just three out of the 10 crossbench members voted with the Liberals: two Justice party members, Tania Maxwell and Stuart Grimley, and the Shooters and Fishers MP Jeff Bourman. Grimley described the legislation as \u201cthe most difficult process\u201d he had taken in his time in parliament. He said he could not support the legislation because of concerns he had about men entering women\u2019s spaces, but said he still believed people had the right to change their birth certificates.

The company announced Tuesday that it had \u201csold out\u201d of the sandwiches \u201cfor now\u201d. \u201cYou ate \u2018em ALL,\u201d the company wrote in a video. \u201cLegit proud of you.\u201d It added that fans can sign up for the Popeyes app to know when it\u2019s available again. In a statement, the fried chicken chain said it \u201caggressively\u201d forecasted demand through the end of September, but has sold out of that inventory since officially launching on 12 August. Restaurants across the country are expected to sell out by the end of the week. People had questions. Others mourned. More took the end of the chicken sandwich as a time to reignite the feud with Chick-fil-A. It was fun while it lasted. As of Tuesday it remained unclear when the chicken sandwich would return. Popeyes\u2019 Twitter video states that \u201cthey\u2019ll be back soon\u201d.",

With the White House blocking that testimony, that could likely leave Democrats nowhere \u2013 unless a judge intervenes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a9149872110ec219ad9c4c76596e310bc2e37e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a9149872110ec219ad9c4c76596e310bc2e37e9/0_0_5497_3665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Representative Steve King.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Representative Steve King.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Neibergall/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Trump </strong>will have lunch with the vice-president, <strong>Mike Pence. </strong>He has no other events on his public schedule.<br></li> <li>Representative <strong>Steve King </strong>will hold a town hall in Iowa at 12pm ET, and the House Republican is likely to touch on his widely condemned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/14/steve-king-iowa-republican-rape-incest-abortion\">abortion comments</a>.</li> <li>Representative Ilhan Omar will hold a community forum in Minnesota this evening.</li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-27T12:58:11.440Z\">at 1.58pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Joe Biden said that racism is an institutional problem in an interview with journalists and ran healthcare ads. He has yet to respond to the news that his brother James Biden had promised his potential business partners that they would have influence with the former vice president. CNN has revealed a schedule for a seven-hour climate change town hall. Deutsche Bank said in court documents that it has at least some of Trump\u2019s tax returns sought by Congress. The letter comes as the president has sued to prevent Deutsche and Capitol One from complying with House Democrats\u2019 subpoena for his financial records. The US attorney general, William Barr, has planned a holiday party at Trump\u2019s DC hotel that could direct more than $30,000 to the president\u2019s business, the Washington Post reported. The Trump administration wants to take more than $150m from Fema disaster relief fund to pay for immigrant detention space, even though Puerto Rico is still recovering from Hurricane Maria and now bracing for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian. A federal judge temporarily blocked Missouri\u2019s eight-week abortion ban as a legal challenge to the law proceeds. In a special court hearing, some of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s accusers detailed the sexual abuse they allegedly suffered at his hands and urged prosecutors to continue the case against the financier despite his suicide. Jair Bolsonaro thanked Trump after the US leader expressed support for the Brazilian president, despite the criticism he has faced over his handling of the Amazon wildfires. Joe Biden said that racism in the US is a \u201cwhite man\u2019s problem visited on people of color.\u201d The AP reports: Taking aim at incendiary racial appeals by Trump, Biden said in an interview with a small group of reporters that a president\u2019s words can \u201cappeal to the worst damn instincts of human nature,\u201d just as they can move markets or take a nation into war. ... The former vice president attributed his support among black voters to the fact that he has a long record of working in their communities \u2014 something, he said without being specific, that several of his opponents have not done. He added that while he would \u201cpreferably\u201d select a woman or person or color as his running mate, he is ultimately looking for someone who is \u201csimpatico with what I stand for and what I want to get done.\u201d He said he will not make a commitment on whom he would choose until he is comfortable that they agree on major issues and how to address them. Biden has had a busy campaign day today. He released a new healthcare ad and commented on Trump\u2019s divisive conduct at the G7 conference even as court documents revealed that his brother James Biden had promised his potential business partners that they would have influence with the former vice president. Joe Walsh, a republican challenger to Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, defended his racism on PBS\u2019s Newshour. Walsh announced that he was running against Trump for the Republican nomination on Sunday. He told Newshour\u2019s Judy Woodruff that some of his previous statements were \u201cpretty aggressive,\u201d but weren\u2019t his views, just an attempt to be provocative and push the envelope. Walsh was temporarily booted off air in 2014 for using racist slurs on his radio show (which he has repeated on Twitter), and had repeatedly stood by his racist descriptions of Haiti and Chicago, saying \u201cThose aren\u2019t racist statements. They\u2019re just facts.\u201d CNN has released a schedule for an upcoming seven-hour town hall focused on climate change that the network is hosting on 4 September. The candidates will be interviewed by different correspondents throughout the day. There appears to be a 20-min break between Klobuchar and Biden, with each candidate featured for 40 minutes \u2013 so, plan your food and bathroom breaks accordingly. Republican and Democratic senators were denied visas to Russia, amid a debate over whether or not Russia should be readmitted into the Group of Seven. The Democratic senator Chris Murphy and the Republican senator Ron Johnson, both members of the Senate foreign relations committee who have advocated for sanctions against Russia, were denied visas. The Republican senator Mike Lee was the only one of the three senators who planned to visit Russian officials and American businesses in the country who was granted access. \u201cThe Russian government is further isolating their country by blocking our visit,\u201d Murphy said in a statement. In a separate statement yesterday, Jonson said: \u201cI had hoped direct dialogue with Russian parliamentarians could help set the stage for better future relations between our two nations. Unfortunately, Russian officials continue to play diplomatic games.\u201d The Russian Embassy in the US responded Johnson didn\u2019t apply for a visa, and accused him of distorting Russian foreign policy in his \u201cusual russophobic manner\u201d. The chair of the House homeland security appropriations subcommittee (which is responsible for legislation allocating federal funds related to homeland security), has released a statement condemning the Trump administration\u2019s decision to redirect $155m from federal disaster relief funds to pay for immigrant detention space. The California representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, a democrat, posted a letter she wrote last week, to the acting head of the homeland security department. In it, she criticizes the department\u2019s notification to congress detailing the decision \u201clacks any analysis to demonstrate the movement of funds is justified\u201d. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Deutsche Bank all but confirmed in a redacted letter to the court that it has at least some of Trump\u2019s tax returns. The letter comes as the president has sued to prevent Deutsche and Capitol One from complying with House Democrats\u2019 subpoena for his financial records. The US attorney general, William Barr, has planned a holiday party at Trump\u2019s DC hotel that could direct more than $30,000 to the president\u2019s business, the Washington Post reported. The Trump administration wants to take more than $150m from Fema\u2019s disaster relief fund to pay for immigrant detention space, even though Puerto Rico is still recovering from Hurricane Maria and now bracing for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian. A federal judge temporarily blocked Missouri\u2019s eight-week abortion ban as a legal challenge to the law proceeds. In a special court hearing, some of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s accusers detailed the sexual abuse they allegedly suffered at his hands and urged prosecutors to continue the case against the financier despite his suicide. Jair Bolsonaro thanked Trump after the US leader expressed support for the Brazilian president, despite the criticism he has faced over his handling of the Amazon wildfires. Maanvi will cover more fallout from the Deutsche revelation and Barr\u2019s surprising choice of party venue, so stay tuned. Deutsche\u2019s redacted letter came in response to the court\u2019s demand that the bank, as well as Capitol One, reveal whether they had financial documents pertinent to House Democrats\u2019 subpoena. The Democratic lawmakers have been seeking Trump\u2019s tax returns and subpoenaed the two financial institutions, which have had business relationships with the president. Trump, in turn, sued to block the banks from complying with the subpoena. The president is now appealing a district judge\u2019s earlier ruling that the banks should comply with the Democrats\u2019 subpoena. Trump is suing in his capacity as a private citizen, but the Justice Department filed a brief last week in support of his legal effort. Given the original subpoena, Deutsche\u2019s redacted letter almost certainly refers to possessing financial records connected to Trump and his immediate family. The US attorney general, William Barr, has booked the president\u2019s DC hotel for a holiday party that could direct more than $30,000 to Trump\u2019s business. The Washington Post reports: Barr signed a contract, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, for a \u2018Family Holiday Party\u2019 in the hotel\u2019s Presidential Ballroom Dec. 8. The party will feature a buffet and four-hour open bar for about 200 people. Barr is paying for the event himself and chose the venue only after other hotels, including the Willard and the Mayflower were booked, according to a Department of Justice official. The official said the purpose of Barr\u2019s party wasn\u2019t to curry favor with the president. Barr holds the bash annually and it combines holiday festivities and a \u2018ceilidh,\u2019 a party featuring Irish or Scottish music. \u2018Career ethics officials were consulted and they determined that ethics rules did not prohibit him from hosting his annual party at the Trump hotel,\u2019 said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the party is not a Justice Department event. While Deutsche Bank did acknowledge it has at least some of Trump\u2019s tax returns, Capitol One said it did not. The banks had resisted answering judges\u2019 questions about whether they possessed the returns and were given until this afternoon to address the matter. Deutsche\u2019s acknowledgement will likely only escalate House Democrats\u2019 pressure on the bank to hand over the returns, but Trump is still fighting the lawmakers\u2019 subpoena to obtain his financial records. Names are redacted in Deutsche Bank\u2019s letter about the tax returns it possesses, but it seems clear that the filing is referencing Trump and his immediate family. The New York Times reported in April that Deutsche Bank had valuable financial information on Trump that House Democrats have sought, including descriptions of the value of his assets and partial tax returns. Trump has filed a lawsuit to try to block House Democrats\u2019 subpoena of Deutsche and Capitol One. Deutsche Bank and Capitol One have repeatedly refused to tell the court whether they had Trump\u2019s tax returns, claiming that \u201ccontractual obligations\u201d prevent them from doing so. An appellate court judge told a Deutsche lawyer last week, \u201cShould we go to court and seek an order? I\u2019m serious. We need to know.\u201d The two banks were then given until today to reveal whether they had the tax returns, but it\u2019s unclear whether Capitol One has done so. Deutsche Bank, who has a longtime business relationship with Trump, acknowledged in court that it has at least some of the president\u2019s tax returns, which House Democrats have sought ever since taking control of the chamber. The finance editor of the New York Times, which has reported extensively on Trump\u2019s relationship with Deutsche, said the bank should have partial returns going back several years. ABC, the network that is hosting the next Democratic debate, is aware of two more qualifying polls being released tomorrow before the Democratic National Committee\u2019s deadline, CNN reports. That means billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who remains one poll short of making the debate stage, will have two final chances to qualify. This is also welcome news for Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman who needs two more qualifying polls to participate. But Gabbard would need to register at two percent or more in both polls, which seems unlikely given other recent results. If one or both of them qualifies, ABC will be forced to split the debate into two nights, Sept. 12 and 13. If only the current 10 candidates qualify, the debate will be held on one night, Sept. 12. And the top-polling candidates, not to mention ABC, are hoping the debate remains a one-night event. \u201cContinuing to assign candidates by random draw for the fall debates makes no sense and is a disservice to primary voters,\u201d a Democratic campaign aide told CNN. \u201cThey want to see Biden-Warren-Sanders-Harris-Buttigieg. They\u2019ve been the consistent top tier for months now. Why keep pushing that off?\u201d The Trump administration is pulling hundreds of millions of dollars from the Homeland Security Department, including FEMA\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund, to pay for immigrant detention space. The news comes as Puerto Rico, still recovering from Hurricane Maria, braces for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian. NBC News reports: To fund temporary locations for court hearings for asylum-seekers along the southern border, ICE would gain $155 million, all from FEMA\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund, according to the letter from Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., which was seen by NBC News. The allocations were sent to Congress as a notification rather than a request, because the administration believes it has the authority to repurpose these funds after Congress did not pass more funding for ICE detention beds as part of an emergency funding bill for the southwest border in June. Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security will lose $116 million previously allocated for Coast Guard operations, aviation security and other components in order to fund nearly 6,800 more beds for immigrant detainees, the officials said. Trump appeared to complain about Puerto Rico needing disaster aid in a tweet earlier today, which misstated the amount of funding the island has received. He has also reportedly complained about alleged mismanagement by Puerto Rican officials, even though his own administration was criticized for its handling of Hurricane Maria. The ACLU took a victory lap on Twitter after a federal judge temporarily blocked Missouri\u2019s eight-week abortion ban. The ban was supposed to go into effect tomorrow, but US district judge Howard Sachs ruled to temporarily block the legislation over concerns about the intent of the law. \u201cWhile federal courts should generally be very cautious before delaying the effect of state laws, the sense of caution may be mitigated when the legislation seems designed, as here, as a protest against supreme court decisions,\u201d the judge wrote in his ruling. \u201cThe hostility to, and refusal to comply with, the supreme court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence is most obviously demonstrated in the attempt to push \u2018viability\u2019 protection downward in various weekly stages to eight weeks.\u201d New York Times columnist Bret Stephens has quit Twitter after getting into a spat with a critic regarding his newsroom\u2019s bed bug infestation. Luke O\u2019Neil reports: Riffing on the newspaper\u2019s predicament, David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, poked fun at Stephens on Twitter on Monday evening. The post received nine likes and zero retweets. What followed was as close to the perfect Streisand effect as one could imagine. Stephens, who was not tagged in the original post, emailed Karpf, and copied in the provost of the university, in an apparent attempt to get Karpf in trouble. And then it went viral. Karpf shared news of the scolding on Twitter, in a post that has now been retweeted 7,500 times and liked 48,500 (and counting). ... Stephens wrote: \u2018I\u2019m often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people \u2013 people they\u2019ve never met \u2013 on Twitter. I think you\u2019ve set a new standard. I would welcome the opportunity for you to come to my home, meet my wife and kids, talk to us for a few minutes, and then call me a \u2018bedbug\u2019 to my face. That would take some genuine courage and intellectual integrity on your part.\u2019 ... On Tuesday, Stephens announced he was leaving Twitter. \u2018Time to do what I long ago promised to do. Twitter is a sewer. It brings out the worst in humanity. I sincerely apologize for any part I\u2019ve played in making it worse, and to anyone I\u2019ve ever hurt. Thanks to all my followers, but I\u2019m deactivating this account.\u2019 Democratic presidential candidates who have not yet made the September debate stage will have at least one more chance to secure another qualifying poll. Quinnipiac University plans to release another national poll on the Democratic primary tomorrow, a CNN reporter shared on Twitter. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer only needs one more poll to qualify, but if this is indeed the last poll before tomorrow\u2019s qualification deadline, it means all the other dozen or so candidates who have not made the stage are officially out of luck. Dozens of House Democrats have signed on to a letter demanding an investigation into the sweetheart plea deal that the late financier and alleged sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein secured in 2008. \u201cWhile we cannot undo the damage Epstein has caused the victims of his abuse, the survivors of Epstein\u2019s exploitation and manipulation deserve a forum to be heard and both they and the public deserve transparency and answers to unresolved questions,\u201d reads the letter, which was signed by 45 Democrats. \u201cGovernment and law enforcement officials involved [should] be required to explain under oath the highly unusual treatment afforded to Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d they add. Trump\u2019s former labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, resigned last month amid backlash over his role in the plea deal. Acosta was serving as the US attorney in Miami when Epstein secured a non-prosecution agreement despite dozens of abuse allegations. During today\u2019s court hearing, the women who have accused Jeffrey Epstein of sexual misconduct recounted in excruciating detail how the late financier allegedly abused them when they were minors. \u201cJeffrey Epstein sexually abused me for many years, robbing me of my innocence and mental health,\u201d said accuser Courtney Wild. She continued: \u201cJeffrey Epstein robbed myself and all the other victims of our day in court to confront him one by one, and for that, he is a coward.\u201d Several of the women echoed Wild\u2019s grief that Epstein\u2019s suicide had robbed them of the chance to see justice served. \u201cI\u2019m just angry that he\u2019s not alive anymore to have to pay the price for his actions,\u201d said a woman who chose to remain anonymous. She recounted how Epstein allegedly assaulted her after she moved to New York to model as a teenager. \u201cI\u2019m a victim of Jeffey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s s international sex trafficking ring,\u201d said accuser Sarah Ransome. She urged prosecutors, \u201cPlease, please, finish what you have started.\u201d A federal judge temporarily blocked Missouri\u2019s abortion ban, which would have barred doctors from performing the procedure at or after eight weeks of pregnancy. The law, which was approved by Missouri\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature back in May, was set to go into effect tomorrow. But U.S. District Judge Howard Sachs decided to block the ban as a legal challenge against it proceeds. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have argued in court that the law goes against the landmark abortion ruling Roe v. Wade, and similar laws in North Dakota and Iowa have previously been struck down. The Missouri law is part of a series of abortion bans passed across the US South and Midwest in recent months, which have sparked fierce backlash among reproductive rights supporters. More than 130 artists have now partnered with Planned Parenthood\u2019s \u201cBans Off My Body\u201d campaign to protest the legislation. US financier Jeffrey Epstein was called a coward and a \u201cdepraved human being\u201d in a New York courtroom on Tuesday by women who accused him of sexually abusing them as teens, Victoria Bekiempis writes for the Guardian. They had been expecting their day in court to be as part of the criminal prosecution and trial of Epstein after his arrest in July. But while in life they allege he robbed them of their innocence, with his suicide in a New York jail earlier this month, he robbed them of their chance to confront him in court in person. However, at a special hearing in Manhattan, alleged victims of the disgraced and now deceased financier, whose political and royal connections going back years have come under fresh scrutiny since his arrest in New York, were able to give voice to their anguish. The full story will be live on the Guardian website shortly and we\u2019ll link to it here. Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon has hit a record for the month of August, a trend that many in the country blame on the policies of President Jair Bolsonaro. Our colleague Jonathan Watts reports: The world\u2019s biggest terrestrial carbon sink lost 1,114.8 sq km (430 sq miles) \u2013 equivalent to the area of Hong Kong \u2013 in the first 26 days of this month, according to preliminary data from the government\u2019s satellite monitoring agency. The data does not include damage caused by fires currently sweeping parts of the Amazon. After an even greater surge in July, the country has now experienced the two worst months recorded by the Deter-B satellite system, which was put in place in 2015 to provide short-term alerts to forest rangers. Scientists warn this year\u2019s clearcutting of forest is now likely to pass 10,000sq km for the first time in a decade, raising concerns that Brazil is slipping back towards the dark years of 1995-2004. ... Since taking power at the start of the year, Bolsonaro has downgraded environment protection efforts and made clear that he supports miners, farmers and ranchers above indigenous communities and other forest dwellers. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump is back on Twitter, praising Brazil\u2019s controversial president and shouting down critics who mocked his Florida resort for a past bed bug incident. Bernie Sanders released a plan to confront the \u201ccrisis\u201d in journalism, which included a proposed crackdown on mergers of major media corporations. The announcement comes as Sanders has faced criticism about his comments toward the press. Joe Biden released a new healthcare ad, part of a six-figure television and digital ad buy in Iowa. House Democrats are asking a judge to expedite a ruling on forcing Don McGahn, Trump\u2019s former White House counsel, to testify. The blog is covering more from the campaign trail and the White House, so stay tuned. Jair Bolsonaro, thanked Trump after the US leader expressed support for the Brazilian president, who is facing criticism over his handling of the Amazon wildfires. Despite Bolsonaro\u2019s claim that coverage of the wildfires is \u201cfake news,\u201d experts are warning that the damage done to the Amazon could cause irreversible harm to the world\u2019s climate. Meanwhile, the Brazilian president is refusing $20 million in international aid until the French president, Emmanuel Macron, apologizes for comments criticizing Bolsonaro\u2019s leadership. Bolsonaro also landed in hot water during the G7 summit for expressing approval of a Facebook post mocking the physical appearance of France\u2019s first lady. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, said he would not meet with Trump until the US president lifted sanctions on his country. Trump said yesterday during the closing news conference of the G7 summit that he would be open to meeting Rouhani under the right circumstances. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has encouraged the meeting in the hope of salvaging the Iranian nuclear deal. But Rouhani said Trump would have to make some concessions before such a meeting could occur. \u201cWithout the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal from sanctions, we will not witness any positive development,\u201d Rouhani said in a televised speech today. The comments marked a reversal for Rouhani, who previously said he would not miss any opportunity to improve Iran\u2019s economic circumstances. Ismail Ajjaw, an incoming Harvard freshman from Lebanon, was deported and had his student visa revoked after eight hours of questioning by immigration officials. The Harvard Crimson reports: U.S. officials deported Ajjawi, a 17-year-old Palestinian resident of Tyre, Lebanon, Friday night shortly after he arrived at Boston Logan International Airport. Before canceling Ajjawi\u2019s visa, immigration officers subjected him to hours of questioning \u2014 at one point leaving to search his phone and computer \u2014 according to a written statement by Ajjawi. University officials are currently working to resolve the matter before classes begin on Sept. 3, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email. ... Ajjawi wrote that he spent eight hours in Boston before he was required to leave. Upon arrival, Ajjawi faced questioning from immigration officials along with several other international students. While the other students were allowed to leave, Ajjawi alleges an immigration officer continued to question him about his religion and religious practices in Lebanon. The same officer then asked him to unlock his phone and laptop, and left to search them for roughly five hours, Ajjawi alleges. After the search, the officer questioned him about his friends\u2019 social media activity. ... The officer then canceled Ajjawi\u2019s visa, informed him he would be deported, and allowed him a phone call to his parents. A third Democrat, Sarah Riggs Amico, has entered the race to challenge Republican senator David Perdue in Georgia. Amico, who unsuccessfully ran for Georgia lieutenant governor last year, said in her campaign launch video that the state requires \u201cnew leadership\u201d to fix the \u201crigged\u201d system. \u201cI\u2019m running to restore Georgians\u2019 faith that they can have a champion in the US Senate who will fight for their families instead of wealthy special interests,\u201d Amico says in the video. \u201cIf we make public policy grounded in our shared values, I believe we can build a government as good as the people of Georgia.\u201d Amico will face off against Clarkston mayor Ted Terry and former Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson in the Democratic Senate primary. Former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who campaigned with Amico in 2018, passed on entering the race earlier this year. In a statement about the the president\u2019s performance at the G7 summit, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden warned of the potentially devastating effects another four years of Trump could unleash. \u201cRather than looking to America for vision, agenda setting, and leadership by example, our closest democratic allies sought to manage and mitigate the damage Trump might do at this year\u2019s G-7,\u201d Biden said. He specifically called out Trump for not participating in the summit\u2019s climate session. \u201cWhen it comes to meeting the existential crisis of our time, Trump has walked away from the table\u2014literally,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf we give Trump four more years, the planet may never recover from his utter disregard for the climate crisis and scientific fact.\u201d Taylor Swift surprised some of her fans last night by striking a political tone while accepting the MTV Video Music Award for video of the year. The pop star encouraged those listening to sign a petition in support of the Equality Act, which would bar discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. The Democratic-controlled House passed the bill earlier this year, but it has not yet been taken up in the Senate. \u201cIn this video several points were made, so you voting for this video means that you want a world, where we\u2019re all treated equally under the law,\u201d Swift said. The singer has previously been criticized for not weighing in enough on politics, although she did endorse Democrat Phil Bredesen\u2019s ultimately unsuccessful Senate bid in Tennessee last year. Other celebrities have also been getting political this week. Artists like Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and Lizzo have partnered with Planned Parenthood for the group\u2019s #BansOffMyBody campaign, which protests abortion bans. The third debate of the Democratic presidential primary may actually be a first for this election season: a one-night event. Democratic presidential candidates have until the end of tomorrow to qualify for the September debate in Houston, and so far only 10 candidates have hit both the polling and donor thresholds. (Each candidate must register at 2 percent or more in four qualifying polls and receive donations from 130,000 donors to participate.) If an 11th candidate qualifies, the Democratic National Committee will split the debate into two nights: Sept. 12 and Sept. 13. But if no one else qualifies, the debate will only take place on Sept. 12. Billionaire activist Tom Steyer only needs one more qualifying poll to participate, so he could still make the cut. Other candidates seem less likely to qualify. But even if they don\u2019t make the stage this time around, candidates will have more time to qualify for the October debate. So there may be more participants in the fourth debate than the third. Trump is also hitting back against some of his critics, who have mocked his proposal to host the 2020 G7 summit at his Florida resort. The president confirmed during his closing news conference at the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, that Trump National Doral Miami was being considered as the site for next year\u2019s gathering. In response, the hashtag #TrumpBedBugs started trending on Twitter as some Trump critics resurfaced this 2017 story about the resort reaching a settlement with a guest who complained he was repeatedly bitten by bed bugs during his stay there. Trump is still tweeting away, this time voicing support for Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro was sharply criticized this week for expressing approval of a Facebook post implying the first lady of France, Brigitte Macron, was not as attractive as Bolsonaro\u2019s wife. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, condemned the comments as \u201cextraordinarily rude.\u201d Bolsonaro is now refusing to accept $20 million in aid for the Amazon wildfires unless Macron apologizes for criticizing the Brazilian president\u2019s leadership. Trump has offered praise to Italy\u2019s embattled prime minister, Giuseppi Conte, who resigned last week but is now enjoying calls to be reinstated. Our colleague Angela Giuffrida reported yesterday from Rome: Talks between the leaders of Italy\u2019s Democratic party (PD) and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) went on late into the night on Monday as they sought to thrash out an agreement on a potential alliance that could avert a snap election. Giuseppe Conte, the outgoing prime minister, joined the meeting between the PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti, and his M5S counterpart, Luigi Di Maio, in a sign that Zingaretti has succumbed to M5S\u2019s demands to reinstate Conte. The nomination of Conte, who last week ended an ill-fated coalition government between M5S and the far-right League, has been the main obstacle in the talks. \u2018It\u2019s close, but not set in stone,\u2019 a source close to the discussions said before the meeting. \u2018If Conte is nominated prime minister, then it could be in exchange for M5S losing some ministries to the PD.\u2019 Di Maio might also be forced to step down as deputy prime minister in exchange, the source added. George Conway, who is married to senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, is once again tweeting his many criticisms of the president. But he has an interesting partner in his impeachment banter: Joe Walsh. Walsh has launched a presidential primary challenge against Trump on the basis that he is \u201cunfit\u201d for office and \u201clies virtually every time he opens his mouth.\u201d Those comments put the former Republican congressman in line with George Conway, who has implied that Trump has a personality disorder and has argued in favor of his impeachment. But the Twitter banter is more noteworthy given that Walsh has reportedly reached out to Conway about taking on a senior role in his long-shot campaign. According to the New York Times, the pair had an \u201chours-long conversation\u201d last week to discuss Walsh\u2019s strategy, during which Conway said he would consider joining the campaign. Joe Biden has released a new ad about healthcare that focuses on the former vice president\u2019s own tragic experiences with the medical system, from the deaths of his first wife and daughter to his son\u2019s diagnosis with brain cancer. Biden\u2019s first wife, Neilia, and his daughter, Naomi, died in a 1972 car accident that also injured his two sons, Beau and Hunter. Decades later, Beau was diagnosed with a brain cancer that ultimately killed him. \u201cHealth care is personal to me. Obamacare is personal to me,\u201d Biden narrates in the ad. \u201cWhen I see the President try to tear it down and others propose to replace it and start over, that\u2019s personal to me too.\u201d The video is part of a six-figure television and digital ad buy in Iowa, where Biden aired his first TV ad last week. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders released a new proposal today that would reform journalism by cracking down on major media mergers and increasing funding for public media at the local level. \u201cWalter Cronkite once said that \u2018journalism is what we need to make democracy work.\u2019 He was absolutely right, which is why today\u2019s assault on journalism by Wall Street, billionaire businessmen, Silicon Valley, and Donald Trump presents a crisis\u2014and why we must take concrete action,\u201d Sanders wrote in a Columbia Journalism Review article announcing the plan. Among other things, Sanders\u2019 proposal calls for stronger enforcement of antitrust laws against tech giants, who have eaten up a large share of digital advertising, and required disclosure of whether proposed media mergers would result in layoffs. The announcement also comes as Sanders has faced criticism for his comments about the press. The Vermont senator suggested earlier this month that Washington Post journalists were covering his campaign in a negative light because the newspaper is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Sanders has previously criticized Amazon\u2019s business practices. Sanders later walked back the comments, clarifying that he does not think the press is \u201canti-Bernie,\u201d but some of his senior advisers have continued to assert that their boss has been unfairly covered in the media. James Biden, the brother of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, promised his potential business partners they would have influence with the former vice president, according to a court filing in Tennessee. As reported by Politico, executives from Azzam Medical Services and Diverse Medical Management say in sworn declarations that James Biden promised the firms that his brother would help them secure business and gain national attention. \u201cDuring my presentation regarding intensive outpatient treatment, James Biden interrupted me to say, \u2018My brother needs to have you in every court system in America,\u2019\u201d the CEO of DMM said. Another executive said James Biden promised \u201cthat the DMM psychiatric care model would be used by Joe Biden as part of his campaign.\u201d James and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, have previously been mired in allegations that they attempted to use their family\u2019s political connections to advance their business interests. Good morning, live blog readers! House Democrats are ramping up their efforts to determine whether to impeach Donald Trump. The House judiciary committee has filed a motion to expedite a ruling on whether the president\u2019s former counsel, Don McGahn, can be compelled to testify. The White House has largely blocked the testimony of former aides by claiming executive privilege. News of the court motion came hours after reports emerged that the committee was subpoenaing Rob Porter, Trump\u2019s former staff secretary who resigned last year amid allegations of domestic abuse. The White House is almost certain to block that testimony as well. The panel seems to be accelerating their efforts to render a decision on impeachment as lawmakers prepare to return to Capitol Hill. According to Politico, 136 Democrats now support impeachment or an impeachment inquiry, representing a majority of the caucus. But the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has resisted impeachment, and she is unlikely to do so without compelling testimony from Trump\u2019s former aides. With the White House blocking that testimony, that could likely leave Democrats nowhere \u2013 unless a judge intervenes. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will have lunch with the vice-president, Mike Pence. He has no other events on his public schedule. Representative Steve King will hold a town hall in Iowa at 12pm ET, and the House Republican is likely to touch on his widely condemned abortion comments. Representative Ilhan Omar will hold a community forum in Minnesota this evening. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",
