The first episode homes in on Little T, the best-known face of Blackpool grime, who was a curly-haired, baby-faced, foul-mouthed 11-year-old when he started out. Now, he has millions of views for his tracks, but no obvious way of turning this into a sustainable career.

(The idea that these things are somehow incompatible is just one of the show\u2019s wilful misunderstandings of the internet.) We see him going up and down his mum\u2019s stairlift, and get a tour of his bedroom, which used to be his niece\u2019s room, and is painted pink, with her name draped across the wall in bunting. It is hard not to feel as if he, too, is being mocked by the cameras.</p> <p>In order to showcase the local grime scene, LOE have decided to put on a Seaside Shutdown \u2013 funny that they settled on this series-arc-friendly conceit while filming a documentary \u2013 and scope out some venues where they might host it. \u201cIt looks grimey, doesn\u2019t it,\u201d says CallyManSam, while the camera cuts to an incongruous statue of Charlie Chaplin. It\u2019s all so side-eye-to-camera and snide.</p> <p>There were parts, however, that briefly melted my stony face. LOE warm up for the Seaside Shutdown at an engagement party for squad member Shelton\u2019s mum, spitting bars in the garden under a nice gazebo. \u201cEven a tramp wouldn\u2019t touch your mother,\u201d they rap, and that\u2019s one of the nicer bits. Shelton\u2019s mum is thrilled with the entertainment. \u201cLoved it,\u201d she beams, full of parental pride at her son and his friends \u201cgrime-ing at her engagement do\u201d.

His mother, Donna, works four jobs, partly to support his grime career, and she appears constantly worried about him, particularly given that he has ADHD and autism. This relatively new, fickle world of instant exposure is curious and the consequences are yet to be fully worked out. If he does not make a go of grime, she wonders, what will happen next?</p> <p>It should have been obvious from the title pun, but at its worst, this does not so much offer a sympathetic look at its subjects as make them the punchline.

A co-founder member of the Congressional Black Caucus, he had a storied career. He was for example the only member of the House judiciary committee to take part in impeachment proceedings against both Richard Nixon, in 1974, and Bill Clinton in 1998.</p> <p>But that career <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/05/john-conyers-will-not-seek-re-election-amid-sexual-harassment-allegations\">came to an abrupt end in 2017</a>, when Conyers was the subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/28/john-conyers-unwanted-sexual-advances-ex-deputy-chief-of-staff-deanna-maher\">extensive allegations</a> of sexual misconduct including a case that was settled in private.</p> <p>He claimed the allegations were \u201cnot accurate\u201d and said he was stepping down for health-related reasons.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My legacy can\u2019t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we are going through now</p> <footer> <cite>John Conyers</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy legacy can\u2019t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we are going through now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis too shall pass.\u201d</p> <p>Conyers was born and grew up in Detroit, the city he would represent, where his father was a union organiser. He insisted his son, a jazz aficionado, should not become a musician.</p> <p>Jazz remained one of Conyers\u2019 \u201cgreat pleasures\u201d. He sponsored legislation to forgive the $1.6m tax debt of band leader Woody Herman\u2019s estate and once kept a bass in his Washington office.</p> <p>Before heading to Congress, Conyers served in the national guard and with the US Army Corps of Engineers during the Korean war, supervising aircraft repairs. He earned degrees from Wayne State University in the late 1950s.</p> <p>From 1958 to 1961 he worked as a legislative assistant to John Dingell, another Michigan Democrat who when he retired in 2014 at 88 was the longest-serving member of Congress, a mantle that passed to Conyers.</p> <p>In 1964, Conyers won his first congressional election by just 108 votes.

      "bodyText": "John Conyers, a Democrat from Michigan who served for more than 50 years in the US House of Representatives, has died. He was 90. A spokeswoman confirmed his death and issued a statement on behalf of the family which said \u201cthe city of Detroit, the United States and the world [had] lost a fearless civil rights leader and hero\u201d. Conyers, the statement said, \u201cwas a devoted father and husband and his world revolved around securing justice against racial and economic discrimination \u2026 his legacy and advocacy for human rights will live on forever.\u201d Elected as one of only six black members of the House in 1964, Conyers served until 2017. A co-founder member of the Congressional Black Caucus, he had a storied career. He was for example the only member of the House judiciary committee to take part in impeachment proceedings against both Richard Nixon, in 1974, and Bill Clinton in 1998. But that career came to an abrupt end in 2017, when Conyers was the subject of extensive allegations of sexual misconduct including a case that was settled in private. He claimed the allegations were \u201cnot accurate\u201d and said he was stepping down for health-related reasons. \u201cMy legacy can\u2019t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we are going through now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis too shall pass.\u201d Conyers was born and grew up in Detroit, the city he would represent, where his father was a union organiser. He insisted his son, a jazz aficionado, should not become a musician. Jazz remained one of Conyers\u2019 \u201cgreat pleasures\u201d. He sponsored legislation to forgive the $1.6m tax debt of band leader Woody Herman\u2019s estate and once kept a bass in his Washington office. Before heading to Congress, Conyers served in the national guard and with the US Army Corps of Engineers during the Korean war, supervising aircraft repairs. He earned degrees from Wayne State University in the late 1950s. From 1958 to 1961 he worked as a legislative assistant to John Dingell, another Michigan Democrat who when he retired in 2014 at 88 was the longest-serving member of Congress, a mantle that passed to Conyers. In 1964, Conyers won his first congressional election by just 108 votes. It was however the beginning of more than 50 years of dominance at the polls, during which Conyers regularly won with more than 80% of the vote, even after his wife went to prison for taking a bribe. Conyers was able to speak his mind. In 2004, he said President George W Bush had been \u201can absolute disaster for the African American community\u201d. In 1979, he called President Jimmy Carter \u201ca hopeless, demented, honest, well-intentioned nerd who will never get past his first administration\u201d. Carter didn\u2019t. In July 1967, parts of Detroit were burned during riots sparked by hostilities between black residents and the mostly white police force. Conyers\u2019 district office was gutted by fire. The plight of the nation\u2019s inner cities would remain a key cause. He used his influence to push civil rights. After a 15-year fight, he won passage of legislation declaring Rev Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s birthday a national holiday, first celebrated in 1986. Starting in 1989, he regularly introduced a bill to study the harm caused by slavery and the possibility of reparations. It never got past a subcommittee. Conyers\u2019 office in Detroit employed the civil rights legend Rosa Parks from 1965 until her retirement in 1988. In 2005, Conyers was one of 11 people inducted to the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame. In 2013, he was fiercely opposed to Detroit being taken over by a state-appointed emergency manager as the city declared bankruptcy. He became chairman of the House judiciary committee in 2006, overseeing hearings the next year into the White House\u2019s role in the firing of eight federal prosecutors and in 2009 on how the NFL dealt with head injuries to players. He was also an early supporter of then-senator Barack Obama, who was expected by some in the Congressional Black Caucus to push public health insurance, sharp funding increases for urban development and other initiatives long blocked by Republicans. \u201cWe want him to stand strong,\u201d Conyers said. He was touched by scandal. In 2009, his wife Monica Conyers, a Detroit city councilwoman, pleaded guilty to bribery related to a sludge hauling contract. She spent nearly two years in prison. Three years earlier, the House ethics committee closed a three-year investigation of allegations that Conyers\u2019 staff worked on political campaigns and were ordered to babysit his two children and run personal errands. He promised changes. Then, in 2017, after a nearly 53-year career, Conyers became the first Capitol Hill politician to lose his job because of sexual misconduct allegations in the #MeToo era. An ethics committee launched a review after a former staffer said Conyers\u2019 office paid her more than $27,000 under a confidentiality agreement to settle a complaint in 2015. She alleged she was fired because she rejected his sexual advances. Others said they had witnessed inappropriate behaviour. Conyers initially said he looked forward vindicating himself and his family. But opposition from colleagues including Nancy Pelosi, then minority leader, proved too much to bear.

In a statement on Sunday, Pelosi saluted a life \u201clived in service to achieving true equality in America\u201d and said Conyers\u2019 leadership made a difference in the lives of countless Americans\u201d. Along with his wife, Conyers is survived by two sons, John III and Carl. In quotes provided by the family spokeswoman, Monica Conyers said: \u201cMy husband was a fighter; when your back was up against a wall, he was right there with you.

      "body": "<p>Sporting perfection is uncommonly rare. Occasionally in tennis or golf someone such as Roger Federer or Tiger Woods will strike a ball so sweetly it feels as if a higher power is involved. In a team game such as rugby union, with so many different moving parts, it is even harder. For everything to click for 80 minutes is meant to be an impossible dream.</p> \n<p>Eddie Jones has been wrestling with this inherent challenge for much of his career. Three years ago he decided to address the subject with his players, using gymnastics as a case study. \u201cWe spoke about Nadia Comaneci,\u201d he revealed. \u201cNo one thinks you can play the perfect game of rugby. Well, no one thought you could get 10 out of 10 in gymnastics. Why not aspire to play the perfect game? Imagine a game where England goes out and from the first to the 80th minute they have total control. What a great dream to have.\u201d</p> \n<p>And lo, it has finally come to pass. Multiple former internationals, opponents and seasoned onlookers have described the semi-final victory against New Zealand on Saturday as the best English performance they have seen. All of them are right. To play this well in a World Cup knockout contest against a hitherto dominant All Black side was genuinely extraordinary.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/oct/27/rwc-final-ticket-prices-rocket-12400-touting-websites-viagogo-stubhub\">RWC final ticket prices rocket up to \u00a312,400 on resale websites</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Jones it justified everything he has been tirelessly working towards for four years. Even allowing for Japan\u2019s famous pool win over South Africa in 2015, his supporting role in the Springboks\u2019 2007 World Cup triumph and Australia\u2019s semi-final ambush of New Zealand in 2003, this was surely his finest hour.

Some of us have long believed English rugby\u2019s all\u2011time high came against Australia in Melbourne in June 2003, a few months before they won the World Cup. The resilience shown in defeating New Zealand in Wellington that same summer bore the same stamp of greatness and, on a couple of occasions, they have been spectacularly good in Dublin. Then there was 1936 when Prince Alexander Obolensky scored two tries in a 13-0 victory over New Zealand at Twickenham, England\u2019s first success against the All Blacks.</p> \n<p>Eighty-three years on, even Obolensky has been overhauled. If Tom Curry does not get you, Sam Underhill will. Even if opponents can escape from Maro Itoje\u2019s octopus-like clutches, they still have to shift the immovable Vunipola brothers and drain the warrior spirit of Owen Farrell. England have long had the ingredients of a fine side and, in the nick of time, it is all coming together.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5186a14affd469e69704dc64dd9b6b8a2d6a4810\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5186a14affd469e69704dc64dd9b6b8a2d6a4810/0_416_2492_2490/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maro Itoje was man of the match in the semi-final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maro Itoje was man of the match in the semi-final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For that, Jones and his lieutenants John Mitchell, Steve Borthwick and Scott Wisemantel deserve as much credit as the players.

He plunges for what feels an eternity (actually 86 seconds) down a well from the wooden gibbet, before the rope stops spooling and the man \u2013 miraculously alive \u2013 slowly starts to haul his way towards the light.

All three are brilliant; Under the Skin is a masterpiece, last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/100-best-films-movies-of-the-21st-century\">named</a> by this paper as the fourth best film of the century so far.</p> <p>The Fall, his first work since Under the Skin, feels entirely of a piece. Long, eerie takes, a score by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/15/mica-levi-under-the-skin-soundtrack\">Mica Levi</a> (there is no dialogue), bright light shining through the pitch black, and everything freighted with exhilarating dread.</p> <p>Glazer, now 54, wants to be reticent about the film, to let it speak for itself. \u201cI thought it would benefit most from being dropped unannounced,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to frame it with any expectation.\u201d This is the only press he\u2019s doing, and he\u2019ll only answer questions by email. Yet he\u2019s curiously fulsome, despite himself.</p> <p>The Fall may be brief, but it turns out to have at least five heavyweight inspirations \u2013 the most flippant of which is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brflux/status/932458087730032640\">a snap of </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brflux/status/932458087730032640\">Eric and Donald Trump Jr</a> on a big-game hunting jaunt. \u201cThe day I saw a picture of the Trump sons grinning with a dead leopard,\u201d he says, was the day he came up with a shot of the mob posing for a selfie with their prey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4613d13ef25c5607e4f72b4b7a294074f221797f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4613d13ef25c5607e4f72b4b7a294074f221797f/550_0_1129_1410/801.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Glazer.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Glazer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Onorati/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a moment that hauls a story, whose bare bones recall Reconstruction-era America and even stone-age justice, firmly into the present.

A mob encourages an abdication of personal responsibility. The rise of National Socialism in Germany for instance was like a fever that took hold of people. We can see that happening again.\u201d</p> <p>Aside from The Fall, the feature-length film Glazer has been working on for the past six years is a<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/10/jonathan-glazer-next-movie-holocaust-a24-film4-access-industries-james-wilson-1202766407/\"> Holocaust drama set in Auschwitz</a>, apparently based on Martin Amis\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/07/the-zone-of-interest-review-martin-amis-impressive-holocaust\">The Zone of Interest</a>, about a Nazi officer who becomes infatuated with the camp commander\u2019s wife.

      "bodyText": "The Americas with Simon Reeve is an amiable travelogue in which a dishy documentarian gads about the US. This Sunday night he was in California, examining giant redwoods and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s mansion. At 10pm, the credits rolled and, abruptly, BBC Two plunged us into hell. For five minutes before the start of Live at the Apollo, the channel screened a new short film in which a masked mob hang a man in a forest. He plunges for what feels an eternity (actually 86 seconds) down a well from the wooden gibbet, before the rope stops spooling and the man \u2013 miraculously alive \u2013 slowly starts to haul his way towards the light. It was broadcast without introduction or credits. There was no clue as to who was responsible. In fact, The Fall is the latest film by Jonathan Glazer, the British director behind gangster comedy Sexy Beast, chilly Nicole Kidman reincarnation drama Birth and Under the Skin, in which Scarlett Johansson\u2019s erotic alien feeds on Glaswegians. All three are brilliant; Under the Skin is a masterpiece, last month named by this paper as the fourth best film of the century so far. The Fall, his first work since Under the Skin, feels entirely of a piece. Long, eerie takes, a score by Mica Levi (there is no dialogue), bright light shining through the pitch black, and everything freighted with exhilarating dread. Glazer, now 54, wants to be reticent about the film, to let it speak for itself. \u201cI thought it would benefit most from being dropped unannounced,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to frame it with any expectation.\u201d This is the only press he\u2019s doing, and he\u2019ll only answer questions by email. Yet he\u2019s curiously fulsome, despite himself. The Fall may be brief, but it turns out to have at least five heavyweight inspirations \u2013 the most flippant of which is a snap of Eric and Donald Trump Jr on a big-game hunting jaunt. \u201cThe day I saw a picture of the Trump sons grinning with a dead leopard,\u201d he says, was the day he came up with a shot of the mob posing for a selfie with their prey. It\u2019s a moment that hauls a story, whose bare bones recall Reconstruction-era America and even stone-age justice, firmly into the present. The masks mix early man and modern social protest \u2013 half Neanderthal, half Vendetta. \u201cI think fear is ever-present,\u201d says Glazer when asked if a lynch-mob mentality is currently being given freer rein. \u201cAnd that drives people to irrational behaviour. A mob encourages an abdication of personal responsibility. The rise of National Socialism in Germany for instance was like a fever that took hold of people. We can see that happening again.\u201d Aside from The Fall, the feature-length film Glazer has been working on for the past six years is a Holocaust drama set in Auschwitz, apparently based on Martin Amis\u2019s novel The Zone of Interest, about a Nazi officer who becomes infatuated with the camp commander\u2019s wife. That film, due to shoot next spring, is \u201cvery much its own thing,\u201d he says. Yet he has spoken about his fascination with photos of Germans thrilled by the horrors they were witnessing \u2013 something seemingly explored in The Fall. Another starting point for the short, he says, was a Bertolt Brecht poem written in exile in the 1930s: \u201cIn the dark times / Will there also be singing? Yes, there will also be singing / About the dark times.\u201d These lines, says Glazer, were inscribed on the inside cover of a collection of essays given to him by a friend. Other inspirations include the Goya self-portrait The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters, in which the napping artist is plagued by flapping bats, generally interpreted as a critique of Spanish society as ignorant, insane and corrupt. \u201cAlso,\u201d says Glazer, \u201chis Disasters of War etchings, urgently titled I Saw It or This Is Worse.

Cincinnati hired Zac Taylor to lead them because of being McVay\u2019s assistant last season, a young coach coming from a team that went to the Super Bowl with an offence that dominated in 2018 like they did here. The attack entered the game as comfortably one of the worst despite Taylor\u2019s credentials.

But he and his team have only got a week to figure out how to beat South Africa, who are as stubborn and tough as they come. Wales found out all about that in a match that felt, for long stretches, like watching 15 desperate men try to tear a hole in a granite slab with their bare hands.</p> <p>And beating New Zealand didn\u2019t do much good for the last three teams who managed it in a World Cup. France did it in 1999, then lost in the final, and again in 2007, when they were knocked out in the semis. Australia managed it in 2003, and then lost to England. Australia\u2019s coach then was Jones.</p> <p>All those England fans will be hoping he learned enough about what went wrong to put it right all these years later.</p>",

We ended up in a McDonalds, of all places, and we were sort of staring out at this empty shopping mall thinking \u2018that didn\u2019t just happen\u2019.\u201d In the end they decided they had to check if it really did, so went back to their hotel to see if they could watch the game again on Japanese TV. It wasn\u2019t on, so they had to wait till Sunday. \u201cWe watched it again first thing this morning.\u201d \u201cIt was just as incredible the second time,\u201d Rebecca said, \u201cright from the very start, when they lined up to face the Haka, it gave me goosebumps all over again.\u201d The one thing they all agreed on was that if their team can play anything like that well again, it didn\u2019t much matter who they face in the final. Jones has admitted he had two-and-a-half years to prepare for that match against the All Blacks: he\u2019d known it could be coming ever since they made the draw back in May 2017. But he and his team have only got a week to figure out how to beat South Africa, who are as stubborn and tough as they come. Wales found out all about that in a match that felt, for long stretches, like watching 15 desperate men try to tear a hole in a granite slab with their bare hands. And beating New Zealand didn\u2019t do much good for the last three teams who managed it in a World Cup. France did it in 1999, then lost in the final, and again in 2007, when they were knocked out in the semis. Australia managed it in 2003, and then lost to England. Australia\u2019s coach then was Jones. All those England fans will be hoping he learned enough about what went wrong to put it right all these years later.",

This circuit doesn\u2019t especially suit his car \u2013 the long straights suit the Ferraris in front of him, and Max Verstappen, behind him, has won the last two races here.

      "bodyText": "1 Hamilton 363 2 Bottas 289 3 Leclerc 235 4 Vettel 230 5 Verstappen 220 Kvyat is given a 10-second penalty for the Hulkenberg tussle, so ends up 11th not the 9th he thought he was. Vettel says it was an intense race and the hard tyres worked better than anyone expected. He had Bottas behind him so Hamilton was cruising for the second stint and he too praises the crowd. Hamilton starts by thanking the crowd, saying it\u2019s the best he\u2019s ever seen. He says it\u2019s an incredible result, thanks his team, and says they came on the back foot thinking it was a hard race for them. His car was damaged, but he hung in there and doesn\u2019t mind waiting for the championship. He loves racing, is not just humbled by \u201cincredibly humbled\u201d and hopes people enjoyed the race. 1 Hamilton (Mercedes) 2 Vettel (Ferrari) 3 Bottas (Mercedes) 4 Leclerc (Ferrari) 5 Albon (Red Bull) 6 Verstappen (Red Bull) 7 Perez (Racing Point) 8 Ricciardo (Renault) 9 Gasly (Toro Rosso) 10 Hulkenberg (Renault) 11 Kvyat (Toro Rosso) 12 Stroll (Racing Point) 13 Sainz Jr (McLaren) 14 Giovinazzi (Alfa) 15 Magnussen (Haas) 16 Russell (Haas) 17 Grosjean (Haas) 18 Kubica (Williams) Hulkenberg drove into a wall arguing over a place with Kvyat. The stewards will look into that one, I shouldn\u2019t wonder. \u201cYeeees!\u201d Hamilton advises his team. \u201cThank you so much for all your hard work. That was a tough race, thanks so much for all your support as always.\u201d What a strange race that was. Great at the start, interesting through the middle with a belting finish on the card, then exhibition stuff at the end. Sebastian Vettel is second, and Valtteri Bottas third, meaning the battle for the driver championship goes onto Texas in two weeks\u2019 time. Hamilton must score four more points to secure his sixth title! Lap 71/71 Hamilton is cruising. His lead is down to 1.8s. but it doesn\u2019t matter. Lap 70/71 So the promised grandstand finish hasn\u2019t materialised, but by way of compensation we\u2019ve had bestowed upon us some absolute exhibition driving from Lewis Hamilton. He is so, so good. Lap 69/71 Vettel takes four tenths out of Hamilton, but it\u2019s too little too late. Lap 69/71 Hamilton will finish 10 points ahead of Bottas, so will need to finish four or more ahead of him in Austin, Texas, which is where the circus heads next. Lap 68/71 Hamilton will make it his 100th podium for Mercedes - only Michael Schumacher, with 116 for Ferrari, has more for one team. Lap 67/71 Hamilton extends his lead back towards 2.4s, and he has this in the bag. Lap 66/71 Verstappen, meanwhile, is sixth - a pretty decent shift from last. He\u2019ll have done 67 laps on these tyres by the end. Lap 65/71 This is proper expertise from Hamilton, who\u2019s managed his tyres brilliantly. He just set the record for the fastest middle sector of the race and a personal best lap - Ferrari thought his tyres would be rinsed by now, but they\u2019re showing no such signs. Lap 64/71 Leclerc looks finished. He\u2019s 2.495 behind Bottas and making no real impression. Lap 63/71 Vettel now leads Bottas by 1.454s, but Hamilton\u2019s lead over Vettel has been cut to 1.923s - it was roughly 2.4s. Lap 62/71 Hamilton must be starting to believe. Lap 61/71 Leclerc just put in the slowest lap of the top four, whole Hamilton stuck in his fastest lap of the race. If he pulls this one off, it\u2019ll be the definitive finding a way to win. Meanwhile, Ricciardo attacks Perez with DRS, goes onto the grass, somehow comes back on ahead and then give back seventh place! Lap 60/71 Bottas is doing well to hold off Leclerc and keep the championship alive for another race. It\u2019s beginning to look like Hamilton\u2019s race isn\u2019t it? Lap 59/71 Leclerc attacks Bottas, but can\u2019t quite manage to get up to him, losing pace in the process! Lap 58/71 5.6s between the top four, ooh yeah! Hamilton has done 34 laps on tyres that he didn\u2019t like to begin with - can he get round on them? Surely not! Lap 57/71 Does Leclerc hold the key? If he nails Bottas, Hamilton can clinch it today, and that\u2019s more likely with Bottas attacking Vettel. Lap 56/71 But Bottas is after Vettel! The gap between them is 0.751s but it\u2019s not quite enough even with DRS. hamilton now leads Vettel by 2.571 - when will Hamilton stop again, when will Vettel attack? Lap 55/71 Leclerc is closing, and Bottas will have a problem sooner rather than later. Lap 54/71 Leclerc will be within striking distance of Bottas in six laps, it is reckoned, Leclerc sitting fourth and Bottas third. Lap 53/71 This is like a jungle tune, setting it up, setting up setting it up ready for the drop. When is it gonna come? Lap 52/71 Bottas looks to line up DRS for a shy at Vettel. The gap is roughly a second. Lap 51/71 Ricciardo, who\u2019s hanging about in sixth waiting for a safety car, comes in - the last man to pit. Norris, meanwhile, decides that enough\u2019s enough or has it decided for him - lapping two behind isn\u2019t doing anyone any good. Lap 50/71 A holding lap. 10.8s covers the top four. Lap 49/71 This is properly set up! Albon sets the fastest lap so far - can he insinuate himself into the finish? Lap 48/71 Hamilton leads Vettel by 2.428, but Bottas is chilling nicely, a further 1.6s or so behind. Lap 47/71 Vettel\u2019s tyres are 13 laps younger than Hamilton\u2019s, and Hamilton will need to stop again ... we assume. At what point does Vettel put his foot down? Lap 46/71 Hamilton leads, but Bottas lies third. If it stays like this, he\u2019ll need to wait at least another race to take the title. Lap 45/71 In goes Albon and that\u2019s how it\u2019s done. He comes out in fifth and Hamilton leads Vettel by 3.412. Vettel\u2019s team think this will be the battle. Lap 44/71 Leclerc stops and they botch it! He stays in the pit too long when they don\u2019t get the rear right tyre on properly! He comes out in fifth, and Hamilton leads! Albon is 2.030s behind him, Vettel another 1.352 away. Lap 43/71 Verstappen sees Perez off, but has 16 seconds to get to Ricciardo. Sharl Leclerc still leads, 8.412 second ahead of Hamilton. Albon is a further three or so second behind ... but ... Lap 42/71 Verstappen is now up to eighth, challenging Perez ahead of him. Ricciardo is ahead of that, then Bottas in front of him. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s happening for Hamilton tonight. Lap 41/71 I mean, obviously they can if things go wrong, but otherwise he looks set to cash in when the other stop. Lap 40/71 I\u2019m not sure how anyone can beat Vettel here. Lap 39/71 Hamilton\u2019s tyres look pretty ropey - someone has misread the conditions. He and Leclerc will both stop again, which makes things look good for Vettel. Lap 38/71 Vettel leads by 3.9s as he goes into the pit and Leclerc assumes the lead, Hamilton next, then Albon, Vettel coming out in fourth. The gap between first and second is 8.118s. Lap 37/71 The reduced gap encourages Bottas to stop while the going\u2019s good, and he comes out fifth, behind Albon and Hamilton. Lap 37/71 Have a look! That battle has naused Vettel right up, and his lead is down to 3.309s. Lap 36/71 Vettel comes up behind a battle for 12th between Sainz and Gasly, which might help the chasing pack. Sainz does a great job of braking late to hang onto his position. Lap 35/71 In commentary, no one knows whose going to win. If we don\u2019t have a safety car, I guess I\u2019d go Vettel because everyone else will stop again, but hamilton\u2019s team keep telling him he can win every time he doubts it. Lap 34/71 Vettel leads by 5.249s, Bottas leads Leclerc by about a second, Leclerc leads Hamilton by about a second. Lap 33/71 I wonder if and when Hamilton will pit again. Surely if he\u2019s not enjoying his tyres he needs to do it sooner rather than later. Let\u2019s have a list: 1. Vettel 2. Bottas 3. Leclerc 4. Hamilton 5. Albon 6 ricciardo Lap 32/71 Vettel is absolutely chilling here, still without pitting. He leads by six or so seconds. Lap 31/71 Hamilton is back on the radio complaining about his hard compound tyres. He\u2019s 0.97 behind Leclerc. Lap 30/71 Hamilton obviously hasn\u2019t made the dent in the lead that he expected. Meanwhile, Christian Horner says he fancies a safety car to \u201cbring this race alive\u201d. Lap 29/71 Hamilton wonders to his team if he\u2019s come in too early - \u201cway too early\u201d, he says. Well! Lap 28/71 Verstappen takes out Hulkenberg and moves into 12th. Lap 27/71 On we go. Lap 26/71 Vettel leads by 6.440, with Bottas then Leclerc. He can hold up Hamilton if his team deem that the thing to do, but can Vettel possibly win from here, given he\u2019s still not stopped? It\u2019s looking good for Mercedes as far as I can see. Lap 25/71 Still Vettel and Bottas stay out as Verstappen eases by Gasly and into 12th. Lap 24/71 Hamilton comes out in fourth and has plenty of clear track to spank in a lap before the Ferraris retort. Leclerc knows that if he wants to finish above Hamilton he\u2019ll have to overtake him on the track - Mercedes\u2019 strategy, allied to Hamilton\u2019s driving is better. Lap 23/71 Vettel leads Hamilton by 1.2s as Hamilton pits. Bottas and Vettel keep at it. Lap 22/71 Hamilton tells his team that his tyres are getting hot \u2013 though not, of course, as hot as Lord Flasheart\u2019s pants. Lap 21/71 A holding lap. Lap 20/71 Vettel, who has also yet to pit, leads Hamilton by 1.9s. By the looks of things, if he\u2019s to win the title tonight, Hamilton needs to win and needs Bottas to come third or lower. Lap 19/71 Verstappen sets a news fastest lap and he\u2019s up to 16th - you\u2019ve got to laugh - but then Leclerc goes quicker. Lap 18/71 Ferrari tell their drivers that Hamilton is indeed on a one-stop strategy. Lap 17/71 So let\u2019s have a rundown: 1. Vettel 2. Hamilton 3 Bottas 4. Leclerc 5 Albon 6. Perez 7. Ricciardo 8. Hulkenberg 9. Stroll 10 Giovinazzi 11 Magnussen 12. Kvyat 13. Sainz 14. Kubica 15. Gasly 16. Russell 17. Verstappen 18 Grosjean 19 Raikkonen 20 Norris Lap 16/71 Leclerc pits - Ferrari are pursuing a two-stop strategy - shoving Hamilton up to second. Will he try and stop just once? Lap 15/71 Albon can\u2019t handle the pace so pits, Hamilton is up to fourth, and Albon comes out behind Sainz, in sixth. Lap 14/71 Norris is back out as Hamilton moves nearer to Albon. If Bottas stays fifth, he needs to win. Lap 13/71 Norris leaves the pit lane with his front left not properly attached! He can\u2019t reverse, so his mates shove him back - he\u2019s not out of the race, but is being welcomed to Lastville. Population: You. Lap 12/71 Still Hamilton sits in. As things stand, he won\u2019t clinch the championship tonight. Lap 11/71 It\u2019s odd that Hamilton hasn\u2019t found a way past Albon; his team can\u2019t see a problem with his car, but will obviously give it a proper shifty when he comes in Lap 10/71 Local favorite, Sergio Perez, is moving through the field and the crowd are absolutely having it as he has Kvyat and goes eighth. Lovely stuff! Lap 9/71 The top four are pretty close together now, separated by a second and change; the gap from Hamilton to Bottas is 6.614s. Lap 8/71 We\u2019ve settled. Verstappen is now 20th and last; unless he gets a full-blown safety car he\u2019s not making it a Mexican hatty. Lap 7/71 Leclerc leads Vettel by 1.3s or so as Hamilton sets a new fastest lap; he\u2019s 1.3s or so behind Albon. Lap 6/71 Hamilton is lapping fastest as Verstappen gets a puncture! He was furious from the off - he must be running on steam power now. Meanwhile, Bottas sees off Nozzer. Lap 5/71 Look at that! Verstappen takes out Bottas on a short straight - you\u2019d never expect to see that - but then Bottas takes him right back out! Lap 4/71 Time\u2019s up. No sooner do we see Hamilton closing on Sainz then he passes him. Meanwhile Bottas attacks Norris, which is a bit snide if you ask me. Lap 3/71 We\u2019re back away and Leclerc leads by 1.655. I guess it\u2019ll be tricky for Vettel to get by him, and though others might be able to, they\u2019ll have to get at him first. Meanwhile, Verstappen, in eighth, is battling Bottas, in seventh. the difference is 0.005. Lap 2/71 Gosh, so much went on in that start - Vettel tickled Leclerc too. Lap 1/71 Hamilton and Verstappen got tangled together I think; and Vettel forced Hamilton over to the grass, which is how he came into contact with Verstappen. Anyway, the virtual safety car is out... Lap 1/71 Hamilton is down into fifth and Verstappen is nowhere! Leclarc leads from Vettel from Albon from Sainz from Hamilton! Verstappen is eighth! Phew! Lap 1/71 And off we go! The front four all get away well, and Hamilton and Verstappen are on the grass! Only Monaco is shorter than the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez, so we\u2019ve got 71 laps of race. I quite fancy Verstappen here. Off they go on parade. The top six are all on mediums. Twenty-one million people live in Mexico City, that is outrageous. By way of comparison, London has 8.9 million. Pathetic. Oh gosh, Button has grey trainers on to match his grey skin-tights. Strength and comfort at this difficult time. I love how little the drivers want to talk to the telly. Premier League managers could learn a lot from them. Jenson Button is wearing extremely tight trousers - I hope the blood flow is ok. Meanwhile, Valteri Bottas says he feels good. Verstappen says it\u2019s a long race with a lot of opportunities. He doesn\u2019t quite use words that begin with eff and off to get the mic out of his coupon. Anthem time... Leclerc, in pole, says that the overnight rain doesn\u2019t seem to have changed the track. He reckons it\u2019ll be hard to keep his first place and was very happy with his second before he was upgraded. Alex Albon says it\u2019s not just about looking in front but making sure to keep the McLaren\u2019s behind at bay. \u201cIf the situation at Williams doesn\u2019t improve next season \u2013 and I can\u2019t see it doing so,\u201d emails Luke Forrester, \u201cI\u2019m afraid to say \u2013 do you think there\u2019s a chance the team might fold in a year or two? They\u2019re so far behind the rest of the pack that it surely can\u2019t be tenable to keep going for too much longer. I\u2019d hate to see it happen, though.\u201d It\u2019s possible I guess, but probably depends on how much they think they can make versus how much they have to spend. Aaaaand here\u2019s Tiesto. He\u2019s supporting Veratappen, which reminds me how much I love it when sportsmen learn sporting phrases in not their other tongue - Michael van Gerwen always refers to Raymond van Barneveld as \u201cMy fellow countryman\u201d. Time for Martin Brundle to run about the grid trying to cajole people who don\u2019t want to talk to him to talk to him. \u201cWhere does Lewis Hamilton stand?\u201d asks Asad Butt. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be somewhere near the top. He\u2019s very near to being the most successful driver ever and his longevity cannot be taken for granted. I\u2019d add Daley Thompson and Mo Farah to the list and would hope that Dina Asher-Smith makes a future appearance.\u201d Yes, all that sounds fair. Thompson whistling the national anthem stands out as a moment from my childhood but as an adult I can\u2019t get my head around his infamous and awful t-shirt. Get yourselves in the mood by reading Giles Richards\u2019 primer. Oh yeah, in answer to my own question, I forgot to add Jet and Shadow. I\u2019ve just learnt that Tiesto will shortly be playing. I guess the plan is to warm up people\u2019s eardrums for the noise of the race. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda depressing to see the grid for the race following teams so much,\u201d emails Tom Smith. \u201cMachine vs man balance all wrong...\u201d I wondered about that while typing it out. I guess you\u2019d argue that teams follow the talent, and Verstappen would\u2019ve been in poll but for an oversight. But yes. A question: where does Lewis Hamilton stand in the all-time list of British sportfolk? Others who are up there: Andy Murray, Bobby Charlton, Kelly Holmes, Denise Lewis, Jess Ennis, Chris Hoy, Steve Redgrave, Ian Botham. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed some. Leclerc (Ferrari) Vettel (Ferrari) Hamilton (Mercedes) Verstappen (Red Bull) Albon (Red Bull) Bottas (Mercedes) Sainz Jr (McLaren) Norris (McLaren) Kvyat (Toro Rosso) Gasly (Toro Rosso) Perez (Racing Point) Hulkenberg (Renault) Ricciardo (Renault) Raikkonen (Alfa Romeo) Giovinazzi (Alfa Romeo) Stroll (Racing Point) Magnussen (Haas) Grosjean (Haas) Russell (Williams) Kubica (Williams) Here we go again! Lewis Hamilton will now attempt to clinch his sixth driver world championship, which will take him above Juan Manuel Fangio in the all-time standings and alone in second place behind Michael Schumacher, who has seven. Increasingly, it\u2019s looking like when, not if, Hamilton supplants him as the greatest of all-time \u2013 and that\u2019s before we factor in him saving the planet. Fourteen points more than Valtteri Bottas will do it, giving him a lead of 78 points with three races to go \u2013 what a victory lap that would be. He starts today\u2019s race on the second row of the grid, but ahead of his Mercedes team-mate, and will fancy himself to, at the very least, hang on to third. This circuit doesn\u2019t especially suit his car \u2013 the long straights suit the Ferraris in front of him, and Max Verstappen, behind him, has won the last two races here.

      "bodyText": "Top Democrats reacted with anger to Donald Trump\u2019s decision to go ahead with the Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi raid without giving them advance notice, on grounds that they were not to be trusted with such highly sensitive information. In a break with precedent, Trump excluded senior Democrats on the so-called Gang of Eight \u2013 the group of congressional leaders who by law are to be informed of covert actions ordered by the US president \u2013 from all operational intelligence. Those cut out of the loop included Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, and Adam Schiff, who chairs the House intelligence committee. To rub salt into the wound, Trump did give prior briefing to a Republican member of the group, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee Richard Burr. He also tipped off Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina who holds no official intelligence position. In his morning address to the nation announcing the death of the Islamic State leader, Trump bluntly suggested that if Pelosi and her fellow Democrats had been given advance notice of the secret mission, lives of the American special forces involved could have been put at risk by leaks. \u201cI wanted to make sure this was kept secret,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have people lost. A leak could have caused the death of all of them.\u201d Pelosi reacted with scorn. In a statement released on Sunday, she praised the \u201cheroism, dedication and skill of our military and our intelligence professionals\u201d before going on to excoriate the president. \u201cThe House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top congressional leadership were notified of in advance,\u201d she said. Trump let it be known that he had informed Russia of the mission ahead of time. \u201cWe spoke to the Russians, we told them we are coming in,\u201d he said. Schumer also put out a statement. Though he did not refer to the shunning of the Group of Eight he did warn of the enduring presence of Isis and called for a \u201cbriefing about this raid and the plan to deal with the escaped Isis prisoners\u201d. Schiff told ABC\u2019s This Week the decision to cut out the eight was a mistake. \u201cIf something had gone wrong, had we gotten into a firefight with the Russians, it\u2019s to the administration\u2019s advantage to say, \u2018We informed Congress we were going in, we gave them the chance to give feedback.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t done.\u201d The Gang of Eight consists of senior members of Congress drawn equally from the two main parties. It includes the speaker and the minority leader in the House, the Senate majority and minority leaders, and the chairs and ranking members of the two intelligence committees. The rationale behind the collective is that the individuals can be relied upon to receive intelligence no matter how sensitive. As Democrats were quick to point out, Barack Obama did brief the Gang of Eight before the mission that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011. That Trump effectively accused Democratic leaders of being willing to put partisanship before country over something as serious as a special forces attack on America\u2019s top national security target is a sign of how wide the gulf has become under his presidency. Trump\u2019s griping about the extent of leaking is entirely understandable \u2013 his administration has indeed been as leaky as a sieve. But most of the big stories to emerge from inside the White House have come not from Democrats but from his own inner circle of senior aides, or from the whistleblower within the intelligence community who sounded the alarm over Ukraine.",

This was a game Henderson clutched to his chest from the first minute, the time of Tottenham\u2019s opening goal, and didn\u2019t let go until it had been shaped to his will, doused in his scent, and generally arm-wrestled Liverpool\u2019s way.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/27/liverpool-tottenham-hotspur-premire-league-match-report\" title=\"\">A 2-1 win</a> means the leaders have now equalled the best 10-game start to a Premier League season.

      "bodyText": "As the red shirts raised their arms at the final whistle, Jordan Henderson got on with hugging everyone he could find. Henderson hugged Davinson S\u00e1nchez and Lucas Moura. He hugged J\u00fcrgen Klopp, folding himself into that nylon\u2011suited embrace while Klopp beamed over his shoulder like a proud father. From there Henderson applauded every stand so enthusiastically he seemed, briefly, to consider moving on to the Tottenham end, or perhaps the TV camera crew paddling in his wake like a pair of faithful R2 units. It was that kind of occasion. This was a game Henderson clutched to his chest from the first minute, the time of Tottenham\u2019s opening goal, and didn\u2019t let go until it had been shaped to his will, doused in his scent, and generally arm-wrestled Liverpool\u2019s way. A 2-1 win means the leaders have now equalled the best 10-game start to a Premier League season. They did so in a way that sprang, in large part, from the captain\u2019s pure, unrelenting will, a way of running, of hurling himself at the day that simply draws the rest of this team in his wake. It has been said Alex Ferguson passed on taking Henderson to Manchester United because he believed he \u201cran from his knees\u201d. This may or may not be the case. Nobody really knows for sure. Not least because Henderson \u2013 sorry, Sir Alex \u2013 isn\u2019t actually a horse. Either way Liverpool\u2019s skipper certainly runs a lot. He ran from his knees all the way to Madrid last year. He ran Liverpool back into this wild, one-sided, entirely gripping game that seemed at one stage doomed to become a ghostly Halloween reprise of that buried trauma of five years ago: Chelsea, Jos\u00e9, endless deep defence, Demba Ba and all that. Brendan Rodgers still thinks Liverpool might have won the Premier League title if they hadn\u2019t lost Henderson for that game. It would have seemed like straw-clutching back then. Not so now.

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s it for Strictly Halloween \u2013 normal service will resume next week, which I for one am quite glad about. Thank you all for joining in with your comments and keeping me afloat last night when I was feeling a bit poorly \u2013 I\u2019ll be back next week at 7pm for another spin around the Strictly dancefloor; in the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you fancy saying hello. Have a fab week! Hx They take to the floor for their final dance to \u2018Ghost Town\u2019 by The Specials. Christ, what a bleak way to finish. I\u2019m really sad now. Catherine and Johannes say the usual lovely things about each other, and shed a bucket of tears. Bit dusty in here. Which means CATHERINE AND JOHANNES are leaving Strictly, which I am very sad about. Catherine had definitely potential (let\u2019s pretend this Cha Cha never happened), and Johannes was one of my favourite things about Strictly this year \u2013 his red carpet high-heeled sass queen voguing last week will go down in Strictly history. Craig saves Mike and Katya, but Motsi saves Catherine and Johannes (ooh interesting). Bruno also saves Catherine and Johannes, which means Shirley has the deciding vote! Shirley chooses MIKE AND KATYA! Controversial. Hard to say which is further off in this Cha Cha \u2013 Catherine\u2019s timing or the Steps vocal. If anything I\u2019d say that was worse than last night on both counts. Ah yes, a bunny Tango to a strangled Gwen Stefani. This really isn\u2019t a bad dance and Mike has improved a LOT since Week 1, but it\u2019s time for Mike to go. So who is joining Catherine and Johannes in the dance off? Kelvin and Oti are safe, along with Karim and Amy, Emma and Anton and Emma and Aljaz. Which means (as expected), MIKE AND KATYA are in the dance off. Do we HAVE to watch the bunny dance again? I can\u2019t remember anything about it, other than the judges liked it more than I did. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of singer/songwriter/actor/guyliner ambassador Adam Lambert. He\u2019s bought his own dancers, which is very bad form. WELL. Chris and Karen have been saved, and now I\u2019m very worried that we\u2019re going to lose Johannes (and also Catherine), assuming they\u2019ll be up against Mike and Katya. Surely Mike can\u2019t survive another dance off? Meanwhile Chris would like us to be clear that his dream about Anton being in his bed didn\u2019t include any funny business. I think you\u2019ve made it abundantly clear over the weeks that you are not gay, Chris, but thanks for clarifying further. So who is safely through to next week? Alex and Kevin are safe, along with Michelle and Giovanni, Chris and Karen (WAIT WHAT) and Saffron and AJ. First couple in the bottom two: CATHERINE AND JOHANNES. Chris looked extremely shocked by that result, as well he should. Last night on Strictly \u2013 a lacklustre Halloween Special saved by Michelle and Giovanni, Kelvin and Oti and Alex and Kevin. I watched Alex\u2019s dance again earlier \u2013 god love Kevin, he does his best under difficult circumstances and thankfully Alex just ignores him and does her thing. It didn\u2019t deserve 9s for the dancing, but for sheer determination under pressure I think she earned every point. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a black Cornish pastry, Claudia in pedestrian black and strappy. The most terrifying thing about this is the Britney vocal. If I was her, I\u2019d be calling my lawyers. And we\u2019re off! Tonight\u2019s Halloween pro dance has a suitably spooky theme \u2013 ankle fog, Giovanni in some kind of bondage harness and pleather trousers, and a breathy version of Britney\u2019s Toxic. So happy right now. Penguins to the left of me, penguins to the right, here I am stuck in the middle with a testosterone-fuelled elephant seal. Sadly we\u2019ve seen the last of the Countryfile Casual Weatherperson for this season \u2013 it\u2019s moved to an earlier slot in favour of the latest Attenborough. I was half-watching Countryfile earlier and caught a glimpse of silver weather fox Phil Avery in blue gingham \u2013 personally I\u2019d have rolled the sleeves up to match that overly casual neckline, but bonus points for a premature poppyjaculation. 6/10. Evening all, and welcome back for the Halloween Special results! Last night felt a bit like trick or treating in the rain, only to discover you\u2019ve got a bucket with nothing in it but parma violets. There were a few drumstick lollies and fizzers towards the end, but generally it was an evening of odd music choices, strange outfits and injured contestants. Tonight another couple has to leave the Strictly dancefloor, before all attention turns to Blackpool in a few weeks. Based on last night\u2019s dancing, it should be Chris and Karen, but I\u2019d settle for Mike and Katya \u2013 join me at 7.15pm to find out! Thank you all for joining in \u2013 I\u2019m off to purge my fever in a dark room whilst reading all your comments. Don\u2019t forget to put your clocks back, and I\u2019ll see you back here tomorrow at 7.15pm for the results! Hx So that\u2019s IT for the dancing \u2013 bar the shouting tomorrow, that\u2019s another Halloween Spooktacular out of the way. It was definitely a show of two halves \u2013 the first half was a bit meh, but they managed to raise the dead in the second half. Michelle and Giovanni were my faves by a very long way, but I\u2019d give a bonus point to Alex and Kevin and Kelvin and Oti. Could be an interesting bottom two tomorrow, Chris and Karen are definitely in trouble, and I suspect they might be sharing the dance-off with Mike and Katya \u2013 there\u2019s a good chance Johannes\u2019 cheekbones may save him. Scores: 7,9,9,9 \u2013 a total of 34 for Alex and Kevin. Who needs Neil? Craig thought Alex did really well \u2013 the style suited her but it was a bit floaty in places. Motsi loved the performance levels \u2013 it\u2019s double what she\u2019s delivered in previous weeks. Shirley thought it demonstrated extraordinary mental ability, it was absolutely on point. Bruno agrees \u2013 Alex delivered under pressure. I really love this routine - the timing isn\u2019t great but I think that\u2019s Kevin\u2019s lack of rehearsal more than Alex. I\u2019m loving the sass and attitude, some great characterisation and bags of style. Enjoyed that. And finally this week it\u2019s ALEX AND KEVIN! This week they\u2019re dancing their Couple\u2019s Choice \u2013 a Street/Commercial routine to \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 by Ray Parker Jr. This kind of dance is very much Neil\u2019s forte, so a real shame that he\u2019s injured and Alex has to dance it with Kevin (who is more of a barefoot contempo-waft kind of guy). Hopefully they can make this work and it won\u2019t end up looking like something strange in our neighbourhood. Scores: 9,9,9,9 \u2013 a total of 36 for Kelvin and Oti. Bruno thought it was BAD, but oh so good \u2013 a Tango with a killer bite and hypnotic intention. There was a small mistake, but otherwise one of the most mesmerising Tangos he\u2019s ever seen. Craig would love to see it again without the mistake, but obviously not in the dance-off \u2013 it was incredible. Motsi loved Kelvin\u2019s inner strength and control, it was brilliant. Kelvin\u2019s footwork reminded Shirley of a long snake, which is now all I can think about. So Kelvin and Oti are is a vampires \u2013 more graveyard fog, DRINK. There\u2019s a lot of faffing about before anyone starts dancing, but the actual Tango showcases how good Kelvin is at leading the dance and being in total command. Some nice changes in pace and contemporary touches, my fave Tango of the series so far. It\u2019s time for KELVIN AND OTI! Their Halloween choice is a Tango to \u2018Bad Guy\u2019 by Billie Eilish. I LOVE this song, and it has a thumping bass that could make a really fun Tango \u2013 I haven\u2019t particularly enjoyed the other two this evening, so very much looking forward to this. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Michelle and Giovanni. Shirley thought it was phenomenal \u2013 it was the perfect number for them, and Shirley\u2019s fave of the evening. Bruno loved the combination of classic, gothic and sassy \u2013 the characterisation was perfect. Craig spotted a tiny bit of gapping, but it was inspired and he loved it. Motsi thought it was sensational and it had lovely technical details \u2013 out of this world. Time for some tens? WOO, graveyard fog! DRINK! Despite not being to see their feet, I love this \u2013 Michelle is 100% fabulous and Giovanni is a weirdly attractive Gomez. Possibly my favourite Foxtrot ever \u2013 I LOVED that. It\u2019s time for MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Foxtrot to the Addams Family theme by Vic Mizzy. Were there ever two humans better suited to playing Morticia and Gomez than these two? Even though this is the most ridiculous song for a Foxtrot ever, I\u2019m SO looking forward to it. Thing came to visit during training. DRINK. Scores: 6,6,5,7 \u2013 a total of 24 for Catherine and Johannes. Motsi liked the sass and the top half of Catherine\u2019s was great, but downstairs nothing was happening. Shirley liked the timing at the beginning, but it went awry and there were mistakes. Bruno wanted Catherine to keep going when the timing went \u2013 she lost her confidence. Craig agrees with Motsi \u2013 the upper half of Catherine\u2019s body was great but the lower half was terrible. Mostly this dance is being led by Johannes\u2019 cheekbones. Nice foot placement and leg action from Catherine, but a few mistakes and a bit lacklustre in places \u2013 it all feels a bit refined, I need more Halloween party abandon. Why is everyone so uptight this evening? Next up it\u2019s CATHERINE AND JOHANNES! Their Halloween choice is a Cha Cha Cha to \u2018Scared Of The Dark\u2019 by Steps, arguably one of the finer songs from the outstanding Steps back catalogue (don\u2019t @ me, I like what I like). All Latin numbers danced by Johannes can only be a good thing, although it feels a bit like Catherine is making up the numbers at this point. More VT comedy. My sides. DRINK. Scores: 7,7,7,8 \u2013 a total of 29 for Karim and Amy. Craig loved Karim\u2019s leaps, but it lacked style and didn\u2019t feel like a Paso. Motsi wanted more intention and for Karim to push it further. Shirley thought it lacked light and shade and it felt like Karim was running \u2013 it needed to be calmer and have more moments of silence. Bruno thought it was original, exciting and creative \u2013 a new interpretation of the Paso for a new generation. OK so apparently this has a Stranger Things theme, which I have never watched so I\u2019m not entirely clear what\u2019s happening. All I can see is Karim in a terrible wig and Amy in a knitted dress, doing one of the more bizarre Pasos we\u2019ve seen. Karim has a nice Spanish line and his footwork is outstanding as always, but I\u2019m mostly transfixed by Amy\u2019s heel/ankle sock combo. For me that was weird, sorry. It\u2019s time for KARIM AND AMY! This week they\u2019re dancing the Paso Doble to \u2018Smalltown Boy\u2019 by Bronski Beat. Of all the weird song choices Karim has been subjected to this year (Kung Fu Fighting, anyone?), this has to be the oddest. Unless the Dave Arch singers are planning to interpret Jimmy Somerville\u2019s falsetto as terror screaming, I really can\u2019t see why you\u2019d pick this 80s electro-bop as a Halloween Paso. Oh good, comedy VT. DRINK. Scores: 6,6,7,7 \u2013 a total of 26 for Mike and Katya. Bruno was pleasantly surprised \u2013 it was a proper Tango with care and attention in the footwork. There were a couple of things that didn\u2019t work, but it was going in the right direction. Craig wasn\u2019t keen on Mike\u2019s bottom and shoulders, but he loved the concept. Motsi liked that it was recognisably a Tango, and it was a solid performance. Shirley liked the lack of gimmicks and Mike\u2019s frame is improving. So this has an Alice in Wonderland theme, because Katya didn\u2019t get the Halloween memo. Despite some nice armography in the middle, this is a bit stompy \u2013 the most animated thing on the dancefloor right now is Mike\u2019s ears. I think if we\u2019re honest we\u2019re all waiting for Mike to leave this weekend. TICK TOCK TICK TOCK. It\u2019s time for MIKE AND KATYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Tango to \u2018What You Waiting For\u2019 by Gwen Stefani. Not a Halloween song, DRINK. Scores: 8,8,8,9 \u2013 a total of 33 for Saffron and AJ. Shirley loved the flick ball change, but Saffron was slightly in front of the music and it needed tidying up a bit. Bruno was bewitched \u2013 it was clean and tight and the chemistry between Saffron and AJ was sizzling. Craig thought it was the first dance he\u2019s enjoyed tonight, it put a smile on his face. Motsi loved how Saffron is \u2018involved with her dance partner\u2019 (not like that), but she needs to look cleaner and more in control. Apparently Saffron is Sabrina the Teenage Witch, which I vaguely remember from the 90s, even though the wig is quite Velma from Scooby Doo. This does kind of work as a Jive and Saffron is giving it both barrels, but she\u2019s struggling a bit to keep up and it feels a bit scrappy (doo) in places. Next up it\u2019s SAFFRON AND AJ! This week they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\u2019 by The Police. I mean, it\u2019s an 80s classic and has the word \u2018magic\u2019 in the title, but in which universe would you pick this for a JIVE? Very odd. Scores: 5,6,6,6 \u2013 a total of 23 for Chris and Karen. Motsi thought Chris\u2019s hips were warmed up, and he compensated for the lack of basics with his personality. Shirley thought there were a few mistakes here and there, and Chris\u2019s hip action could have been pushed further. Bruno thought it was good in a horrible way, but he needs to focus on the timing. Craig thought Chris looked like he came back from the dead, and his joints needed some WD-40. I love these costumes, they both look incredible. Did Karen fall over at the beginning, or was that supposed to look that shambolic? Chris\u2019s timing leaves a lot to be desired, and the Samba walks look like he\u2019s being chased by a wasp. I have no idea what just happened. It\u2019s time for CHRIS AND KAREN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Samba to \u2018Everybody (Backstreet\u2019s Back)\u2019 by Backstreet Boys. This isn\u2019t technically a spooky song, but the original video was a Halloween classic. Fingers crossed for some actual Samba content amongst the zombie lurching and boyband dance breakdowns. Scores: 6,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 30 for Emma and Aljaz. Craig thought it lacked energy and sharpness, and some of the steps were a bit lame. Motsi doesn\u2019t agree \u2013 it was polished and had a touch of spice. Shirley wants Craig to get in the Halloween spirit \u2013 Emma is blossoming and her \u2018petals are opening week by week\u2019. Bruno thought Emma sold it, she was a flapper from Tatler. \u2018Some tricks and quite a few treats in there\u2019 adds Tess, half-heartedly. I miss Len. Grey haired Aljaz is quite unsettling, but I\u2019m loving the energy of this Charleston. This feels like a very different Emma from the one we saw in Week 1 \u2013 her performance skills have come on leaps and bounds. A bit shaky in the transitions and a bit scrappy in the footwork, but great fun. Next up it\u2019s EMMA AND ALJAZ! This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018A Little Party Never Killed Nobody\u2019 by Fergie feat. Q-Tip and GoonRock. Not technically a spooky track, other than having an oblique death reference in the title, so DRINK. However this song does have some serious Gatsby vibes, so should be perfect for a Charleston. Apparently the Ts&amp;Cs were read by actress Anna Maxwell Martin. Sorry Anna, I don\u2019t watch nearly enough TV. So it seems Will fell off a table in studio rehearsal and had hurt his knee, but he and Janette will be back next week. Good news. Time for the Halloween Terms and Conditions, courtesy of someone I\u2019ve never seen before in my life and didn\u2019t catch the name of. Sorry. Scores: 5,7,8,8 \u2013 a total of 28 for Emma and Anton. Shirley thought Emma did very well \u2013 it was sharp and staccato but she wants Emma to work on the chemistry and passion. Bruno loved the grand production and the concept, but Craig thought it lacked aggression and drive \u2013 Emma needs to up her game. Motsi loved the complicated choreography and Emma\u2019s posture, but wanted more energy. Emma has gone full Helena Bonham Carter, it\u2019s absolutely terrifying. Super-fast footwork on this Tango, but Emma\u2019s top line needs more extension and it all feels a bit passionless. A bit more attack from Emma would not have gone amiss. First up tonight it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! This week they\u2019re dancing the Tango to \u2018Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\u2019 by Bach. I love a classical Tango and this music is incredible, even if it does remind me of the theme to Ski Sunday, because I am a peasant. Will be very disappointed if they haven\u2019t wheeled an enormous pipe organ into Elstree studios. No Will and Janette this evening, Will has injured his knee. Boo, that\u2019s a shame, hope he\u2019s OK. Neil is also injured, so Kevin is dancing with Alex. Kevin looks very pleased about it. Out come the stars! Why is Aljaz dressed as Philip Schofield? TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a black shroud, Claudia in an unfinished beige ballgown. Sure. Because it\u2019s a feem week, we get a bonus pro dance, seemingly set in the Natural History Museum. More bad acting, DRINK. Everyone is walking like an Egyptian. I have no idea what this has to do with Halloween, other than it being horrible. Mostly this does not feature red carpet Johannes giving it sass in heels, so it\u2019s a no from me. And we\u2019re off! Cue bad Halloween acting - DRINK. In random Pointless facts, I used to regularly play Scrabble online with Rufus Hound. He was very good at it. This week\u2019s Halloween Special Strictly Come Bingo \u2013 a swig of your favourite poison for any occurrence of the following: The word \u201cspooktacular\u201d Obscure non-scary music choices Graveyard ankle fog Bad VT acting Early sightings of training room poppies I\u2019m all over the Pointless piers \u2013 Clevedon, Southwold, Brighton, Llandudno, Cromer. Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing Halloween Special! Gird your mummified loins for for an evening of spooky Sambas, quivering Quicksteps and chilling Charlestons, plus all the usual madness of a sugar-fuelled, pumpkin-spiced evening in the Elstree house of horror. After David and Nadiya\u2019s non-shock exit last week, the competition is starting to warm up (it doesn\u2019t officially hot up until Blackpool). I\u2019ve updated Heidi\u2019s (Haunted) Hunches below, but the Strictly Halloween Special has a rich history of torturing dance integrity in favour of gimmicks and props, so all bets are off at this point. Group 1: driving for December \u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni, Karim and Amy, Alex and Neil Group 2: battling for Blackpool \u2013 Emma B and Anton, Will and Janette, Saffron and AJ, Emma W and Aljaz, Catherine and Johannes Group 4: dodging the dance-off \u2013 Mike and Katya, Chris and Karen Just FYI I\u2019m a little under the weather this weekend, so apologies in advance if tonight\u2019s liveblogging feels a bit like rigor mortis has set in. I\u2019ll be getting my freak on up here from 6.35pm, whilst you are actively encouraged to brush away the cobwebs and cast a few spells in the comment box below. Grab a bottle and the bag of trick or treat sweets (they were never going to make it until Thursday anyway) and I\u2019ll see you then! Wooooo, etc.",

Top stories The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has been killed in a raid by US special forces on his Syrian safe house, Donald Trump has announced, ending a years-long manhunt for one of the world\u2019s most wanted terrorists. Trump said the \u201cimpeccable\u201d two-hour operation had been conducted on Saturday night in the province of Idlib, one of the last areas of the country still outside Syrian regime control, and that US officials had confirmed that Baghdadi, 48, was among those killed. \u201cUS special operations forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid in north-west Syria and accomplished their mission in grand style,\u201d Trump said, adding that Baghdadi had detonated a suicide vest and killed himself and three of his children. \u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\u201d More than 240 conservation scientists have called on Scott Morrison to drop his opposition to stronger environment laws and seize a \u201conce-in-a-decade opportunity\u201d to fix a system that is failing to stem a worsening extinction crisis. With the federal government due to announce a legislated review of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, scientists have signed an open letter to the PM urging him to increase spending and back laws to help protect the natural world. The letter says three native species have become extinct in the past decade and 17 others could follow in the next 20 years. Fifty birds. Eighteen days. Only one winner. Bird of the year is back. In partnership with BirdLife Australia, Guardian Australia is running a poll to determine which of our feathered friends is considered No 1 in the eyes of the public. While this sounds like a popularity contest (it is), there is a greater goal. \u201cThis is to draw attention to the birds we all love,\u201d Samantha Vine, head of conservation at BirdLife Australia, says. \u201cEveryone has a bird story. Everyone, perhaps without even noticing it, will have birds in their life. They\u2019re one of the most beautiful, colourful, sometimes cheeky, parts of nature we interact with.\u201d You can vote today from a list of 50 birds. Australia A third of all children with disability have been restrained or secluded at school, while half have been bullied in the past year, according to a government-funded report that reveals \u201csevere neglect and abuse\u201d of young people and calls for \u201cspecial schools\u201d to be phased out. The Labor senator Pat Dodson has blasted Scott Morrison for his absence at last night\u2019s celebrations of the closing of the climb at Uluru as \u201cmore than an insult\u201d to First Nations people. A Perth mother has been charged with murdering her two young daughters. The bodies of six-year-old Tiana Djurasovic and her 10-year-old sister, Mia, were found about 6pm on Friday. The girls\u2019 mother, Milka Djurasovic, was charged with two counts of murder by police. The world Thousands of Iraqi protesters occupied Baghdad\u2019s central Tahrir square yesterday, defying a bloody crackdown that killed scores at the weekend. A man detained at Dublin Port on Saturday is the haulier who delivered a trailer to Zeebrugge before it was found in Essex with the bodies of 39 people inside, according to Belgian authorities. The UK government could try to force a pre-Christmas election via a simple majority for a parliamentary bill, Downing Street has said, after a Liberal Democrat-devised plan to try to end the House of Commons impasse. An tiny early Renaissance masterpiece found in a French woman\u2019s kitchen during a house clearance has fetched more than \u20ac24m (A$39m) at auction, making it the most expensive medieval painting ever sold.

      "bodyText": "When Joe Klein was identified as the anonymous author of Primary Colors, a bestselling 1996 satire of campaign life with the Clintons, he arrived at a press conference wearing a Groucho Marx disguise. Though he did not counsel quite so lighthearted an unveiling, Klein said on Sunday he thought the author of A Warning, the book by a mystery senior Trump official which will go on sale next month, should not stay unnamed for long. Last year, the official authored an earth-shaking New York Times column, entitled I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration and detailing what he or she characterised as efforts to protect the country from its ungovernable governor. Such efforts have been widely reported since. Watergate reporter Bob Woodward\u2019s book Fear, for example, begins with a scene of the chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, removing a document about a trade deal from the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. \u201cI stole it off his desk,\u201d Cohn is quoted as saying. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let him see it. He\u2019s never going to see that document. Got to protect the country.\u201d The military news site Task &amp; Purpose, meanwhile, reported that in a book to be published on Tuesday, a former aide to James Mattis says Trump ordered his first defense secretary to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d, owned by Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, out of a $10bn Pentagon contract. \u201cRelaying the story to us,\u201d the site quoted the Hold the Line author Guy Snodgrass as writing, \u201cMattis said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do that. This will be done by the book, both legally and ethically.\u201d Trump is now the subject of an impeachment inquiry centred on his attempts to have Ukraine investigate his political rivals. His supporters would dearly love to know who is behind the Times column and the forthcoming book, which Axios revealed promises to contain \u201ca great deal from Donald Trump directly\u201d. Introducing Klein on CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources on Sunday, host Brian Stelter said a \u201cpublishing world source\u201d had told him the instances of misconduct by Trump described in the book are \u201cspecific and shocking\u201d. Klein, 73, is a former editor and columnist for Rolling Stone, New York and Newsweek. He said his own book had not had such stratospheric expectations, but when it was published its air of mystery helped it \u201cexplode like a bomb\u201d. The anonymous nature of A Warning was helping ratchet up anticipation, he said, adding that \u201cyou also have the track record of the column a year ago, which I thought was a courageous act\u201d by one of the people who formed \u201cguardrails\u201d against Trump\u2019s wild behaviour. \u201cI think that the guardrails are off,\u201d Klein said, \u201cand now is the time for people of good faith to stand up, identify themselves and tell the story.\u201d Referring to testimony to House committees which continues behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, he said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got \u2026 a parade of foreign service officers going in, identifying themselves, risking their careers and now that Trump is clearly way off the rails, it\u2019s time for everybody to put their cards on the table.\u201d \u201cThere may be six smoking guns in there,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWhoever this is has successfully remained anonymous for a year now, which is something I couldn\u2019t do.\u201d Klein pointed to a Washington Post report which detailed attempts by Republicans to uncover the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump\u2019s conduct regarding Ukraine lies at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. Unlike the author of A Warning, he said, \u201cthe whistleblower under law has the right to privacy \u2026 unless the anonymous author was the whistleblower, which would be hilarious, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s mindblowing,\u201d Stelter said. Klein also pointed out that the whistleblower\u2019s life could be in danger. That might also apply to the anonymous Trump official. Two decades ago, Klein was rumbled by Don Foster, an expert in literary forensics. Most observers expect the Trump official to be unmasked relatively quickly too, whether by forensic analytical software, by the kind of simple human error which revealed Harry Potter author JK Rowling to be the pseudonymous mystery writer Robert Galbraith, or in a coordinated public reveal. The Washington punditocracy is awash with theories over who it might be. Prominent bets include Jon Huntsman, former Utah governor and ambassador to Russia; Cohn, a New York Democrat who did not issue an outright denial about Woodward\u2019s reporting; or even Nikki Haley, formerly ambassador to the United Nations and widely seen as a future Republican leader.

      "bodyText": "The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has been killed in a raid by US special forces on his Syrian safe house, Donald Trump has announced, ending a years-long hunt for one of the world\u2019s most-wanted terrorists. Trump said the \u201cimpeccable\u201d two-hour operation was conducted on Saturday night in the province of Idlib, one of the few areas of the country still outside Syrian regime control, and that US officials had confirmed Baghdadi, 48, was among those killed. \u201cUS special operations forces executed a dangerous and daring night-time raid in north-west Syria and accomplished their mission in grand style,\u201d he said. The US president, facing impeachment proceedings and under bipartisan fire for withdrawing troops from the Syrian border, basked in the demise of the self-styled caliphate leader, whose final moments he described in vivid, indulgent detail. \u201c[Baghdadi] running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\u201d Trump said. Cornered, Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest and killed himself and three of his children, Trump said. \u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place,\u201d he said. World leaders welcomed the news of Baghdadi\u2019s death but also struck notes of caution. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, said: \u201cThe death of Baghdadi is an important moment in our fight against terror but the battle against the evil of Daesh [Isis] is not yet over.\u201d Trump said US forces were engaged with \u201cmassive firepower\u201d as their helicopters arrived at the building where Baghdadi was sheltering with his family and associates. \u201cThe compound had to be cleared at this time, with people either surrendering or being shot and killed,\u201d he said. \u201cEleven young children were moved out of the house and are uninjured. \u201cThe only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, and he had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to a certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. \u201c[Baghdadi] ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. Test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification. It was him.\u201d The US president had presaged the news of Baghdadi\u2019s death in characteristic style, inviting speculation by tweeting at 9.23pm on Saturday in Washington DC: \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d Iraqi officials told the Guardian the hunt for Baghdadi had intensified over the past month since they identified a Syrian man who had moved his family members and wives from Iraq to Syria. An Iraqi intelligence official said the wives of Baghdadi\u2019s two brothers, Jumah and Ahmad, along with other family members, were monitored as they moved to the region. The information was passed to the CIA earlier this month, the officials said. Several Syrian rebel groups active in Idlib province said they had been asked by US officials over the past fortnight to establish whether senior Isis members were hiding in Idlib. Diane Foley, whose son James was among those whose deaths were filmed for gruesome murder videos that became a trademark of Isis, said: \u201cI am grateful to our president and brave troops for finding Isis leader Al-Bagdadi. \u201cI hope this will hinder the resurgence of terror groups and pray that captured Isis fighters will be brought to trial and held accountable.\u201d Trump mentioned Foley in the press conference as well as other American hostages killed in the group\u2019s custody: Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller. He also referenced Muath al-Kasasbeh, the Jordanian pilot the terrorist group burned to death. The US national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, said the operation to kill the Isis leader had been named after Mueller, a humanitarian worker who was imprisoned by the group, tortured and repeatedly sexually abused by Baghdadi. She died in Isis confinement at the age of 26. Trump thanked the governments of Russia, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, as well as the Syrian Kurdish forces, for their assistance. US special forces reached the compound onboard eight helicopters that flew through Russian-controlled airspace with Moscow\u2019s permission, he said, while the Kurds provided intelligence. Trump said Baghdadi was \u201cthe biggest there is\u201d, casting the operation as the US\u2019s greatest counter-terrorism feat, greater even than the killing of the al-Qaida leader, Osama Bin Laden, under his predecessor, Barack Obama. \u201cOsama bin Laden was big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country.\u201d Baghdadi\u2019s death is likely to be a significant fillip for Trump, who has faced withering criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike for withdrawing troops from north-eastern Syria, effectively allowing Turkey to move against the US\u2019s Kurdish allies in the region. Trump\u2019s critics have claimed the Syrian pullout would allow Isis to resurge in Syria and pose a renewed threat to US interests \u2013 arguments that could be blunted by the latest operation, even if the risk from remnants of the militant group remains. Baghdadi\u2019s death is a devastating blow to a terror group that had run rampant across the region for five years from mid-2014, spawning gruesome terrorist attacks across the world, amplifying a mass refugee exodus and sparking a war to contain it that killed thousands of people and displaced millions more. Throughout, Baghdadi remained the face of Isis: a fearsome, implacable ideologue who eluded the world\u2019s intelligence agencies while continuing to incite a war of civilisations. Though long speculated to be a possible hideout, Idlib had been thought by many regional officials to be too risky a proposition for Baghdadi, who was more accustomed to the deserts of Iraq, where his organisation had risen. For days, US officials had feared Isis would seek to capitalise on the upheaval in Syria. But they also saw a potential opportunity in which Isis leaders might break from more secretive routines to communicate with operatives, potentially creating a chance for the US and its allies to detect them.",

While Abbott said she would welcome a campaign \u2013 \u201cWe have over half a million members and they want an election\u201d \u2013 the sentiment is not unanimous in the party, with many MPs and a number of shadow ministers wary about agreeing to an election, given recent polls showing the Conservatives taking a lead of up to 16%. One senior MP said Labour\u2019s coherence on the issue could be tested if the EU agreed to a 31 January extension: \u201cI get the impression we have quite a unified position as things stand. If the EU granted a long extension, that may change,\u201d the MP said.",

From about 2010 onwards, Conservative leaders began to blame the public spending of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/labour-economic-crisis-tories\" title=\"\">previous Labour governments</a> for the huge financial deficit caused by the bank crash. What was most appalling was not the barefaced untruth. It was that nobody seemed to have the energy to rebut that lie. Millions of people were left to believe it, and probably still do. The Brexit campaign released an avalanche of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/eu-referendum-reality-check-leave-campaign-promises\" title=\"\">feebly</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/eu-referendum-reality-check-leave-campaign-promises\" title=\"\"> contested lies</a>, on which the present prime minister still happily slaloms.</p> \n<p>Within England, political geography has changed. More accurately, the way people see the enormous gap in wealth, opportunity, infrastructure and innovation between the London region and \u201cEngland outside London\u201d has sharpened. The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/northern-powerhouse-investment-george-osborne\" title=\"\">northern powerhouse</a>\u201d efforts, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/25/if-boris-johnson-wanted-britain-to-lead-the-world-he-would-stop-hedging-his-bets-and-back-hs2\" title=\"\">HS2</a>, only revive a long history of sticking-plaster remedies for what were once called \u201cdistressed areas\u201d.</p> \n<p>The change now is that two streams of bitter resentment \u2013 at London\u2019s unfair wealth and privilege and at Westminster\u2019s unfair refusal to \u201cobey the people\u201d \u2013 have converged into a single torrent. London is the most spectacularly diverse metropolis in Europe, which even after Brexit will go on sucking in the money of global oligarchs and hedge funds, and the location of new British institutions. London as an independent city state, like Singapore, would prosper, but in the short term it will bankrupt whatever is left of Hillary\u2019s \u201cgreat rest of England\u201d.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s commonly said that the Brexit years have made the English more xenophobic, less tolerant, more angrily divided among themselves. The first is clearly true. Non-British Europeans confirm a new nastiness, even just a new coldness. So, even more emphatically, will migrants from Somalia, Nigeria, India, Bangladesh.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s true that English dislike of foreigners is ancient, abating in the middle 19th century as the public welcomed political refugees from failed revolutions, but only for an interval. A <a href=\"http://hummedia.manchester.ac.uk/institutes/code/briefings/dynamicsofdiversity/code-census-briefing-national-identity-scotland.pdf\" title=\"\">recent example</a>: in a sample of adults in Scotland who list Pakistani as their ethnicity, 31% identified as Scottish. The corresponding sample taken in England found only 15% identifying as English. That tells you nothing particularly wonderful about Scotland, except that it\u2019s a normal country. But it does tell a tale about England: a nation self-consciously unlike others and uneasy about sharing its \u201cessence\u201d with others.</p> \n<p>More angry, more violent in the course of these three years? Very angry, certainly, but no angrier (and so far much less violent) than their great-grandparents were over Irish home rule or rights for women. Or, come to that, than some of their fathers and mothers were over the miners\u2019 strike or the poll tax. It\u2019s remarkable that in the past three years it\u2019s the remainer half of Britain that goes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2019/oct/19/thousands-join-peoples-vote-march-london-brexit-second-referendum-in-pictures\" title=\"\">roaring down the streets</a>. The leavers, with their own powerful case to feel aggrieved and betrayed, stay at home and share their wrath with family and friends. England has a vigorous history of rioting. But for this generation, the default leave position seems to be: \u201cLeave us in peace! Get it done, and go away.\u201d There is much talk about the need to reform Britain\u2019s democracy, but nothing like any coherent idea of what should replace it.</p> \n<p>At the core of the three-year wrangle is constitution fuzziness. Where does final authority rest? Is it with the people, speaking through a referendum? Or with a prime minister claiming in a spooky way that he embodies the Queen and her prerogative ? Or with the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty? Nobody knows. The result is skateboard politics: an empty thunder of promises, then reckless plunges and then crashes into failure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f3d005-f8c8-46c1-9dff-32c9f6b5ee1d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kMgeJD7-G90?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But meanwhile, and quietly, something utterly transforming has been seeping into politics. The law is beginning to infiltrate the tattered old doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. It\u2019s years since \u201cjudicial review\u201d of government decisions began to wear moth-holes in the doctrine\u2019s fabric. Now the Brexit arguments have jerked the process into high gear: the supreme court\u2019s decision to strike down Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation was a blow in favour of democracy.

In the long term, Lady Hale and her judges have torn a huge rent in that doctrine. They have brought closer the moment when all the rents and moth-holes run together and parliament (as in all modern democracies) becomes subject to supreme constitutional law.</p> \n<p>The other day, Michael Ignatieff \u2013 once leader of Canada\u2019s Liberals \u2013 disconcerted his British TV hosts by saying that British democracy was working well. What I think he meant was that the civilities were still preserved: \u201cthe honourable member\u201d and so forth. Politicians see it differently, after three years of increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/25/outrage-as-boris-johnson-dismisses-dangers-of-inflammatory-language-as-humbug-video\" title=\"\">rude and aggressive language</a> flung about the Commons. But Ignatieff, who knows England even better than his native Canada, sees further. As yet, Brexit has not led to fist-fights in the chamber, as seen in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/dec/13/ukraines-parliament-brawl-video\" title=\"\">Ukraine</a> or Italy. This is interesting, as in the last century MPs from time to time brawled round the dispatch box, even when sober. But it\u2019s half a century ago that Bernadette Devlin sprang across the floor and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00nm166\" title=\"\">belted Reggie Maudling</a>, the home secretary, across the face. Today, passive contempt for the other lot is more common than active fear and hatred. For the moment, basic civility survives between Britons, who take their frustrations out on foreigners.</p> \n<p>But the deepest change since 2016 is the weakening of the United Kingdom\u2019s inner bonds. Theresa May went around preaching about \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/16/scottish-independence-may-uk-sturgeon-referendum\" title=\"\">our precious, precious </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/16/scottish-independence-may-uk-sturgeon-referendum\" title=\"\">union</a>\u201d. This puzzled me, given massive English indifference. Ask somebody in Durham or Exeter why the union matters, and you get a blank stare, a shrug and perhaps a mumble.

      "bodyText": "Anti-immigrant populists beat Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU) to second place in an election in the east German state of Thuringia yesterday, building spectacularly on their steady momentum since first entering the Bundestag two years ago. According to exit polls, the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) took nearly 24% of the vote, beating the centre-right CDU by one percentage point but, as expected, failing to oust incumbent leftwingers Die Linke. The AfD more than doubled its share of the vote. Despite that, it has no chance of entering power yet, as other parties have ruled out joining it in a coalition. But the party\u2019s national standing is boosted by the result, which was closely watched in Berlin, as is the status of its state leader Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, considered Germany\u2019s most controversial politician, who has been accused of stoking hatred with anti-Jewish rhetoric. The state now faces months of protracted coalition negotiations. AfD\u2019s showing means it will be impossible for Die Linke (30% of the vote), the left-of-centre Social Democrats (8%) and the Green party (5.5%) to repeat their coalition. A minority government led by Die Linke is the most likely outcome, reflecting the increasing fragmentation of the political landscape across Germany in recent years. The CDU, which rules at the national level in a coalition with its Bavarian sister party the CSU and the SPD, suffered its worst result in the state, losing more than 11 percentage points to take 22.5% of the vote. The election campaign was characterised by Nazi slogans and death threats and overshadowed by the deadly attack on a synagogue in the city of Halle earlier this month. Mike M\u00f6hring, the leader of the CDU in Thuringia, received a death threat during the campaign that quoted the Nazi greeting \u2018Heil Hitler!\u2019. Neo-Nazis threatened to stab him in the neck or attack one of his election rallies with a bomb if he did not end his campaign. The CDU\u2019s general secretary, Paul Ziemiak, said: \u201cIt is a bitter result for the CDU ... and this is a bitter day for the democratic centre of Germany in Thuringia.\u201d Bodo Ramelow, Thuringia\u2019s current prime minister who is extremely popular in the state, has directly blamed H\u00f6cke for allowing people to identify with extremist parties. Ramelow told broadcaster NTV he was proud of Thuringians, who had turned out in record numbers for the vote. He said he hoped that the result would encourage parties who had previously vowed never to work together with his Die Linke to recognise the necessity to do so. \u201cOn a parliamentary level there are various themes on which we can all work together for the common good,\u201d he said. But he was troubled by the AfD\u2019s strong result. \u201cIt is painful that voters feel that they need to protest against the grand coalition in this way by choosing someone like H\u00f6cke ...

We fought together, we were victorious together, and now it\u2019s the time to celebrate together.\u201d The former history teacher, who was accused of contributing to the antisemitic sentiment behind the Halle attack, has drawn criticism for calling Berlin\u2019s Holocaust Memorial a \u201cmonument of shame\u201d and for demanding more attention be paid in schools\u2019 history teaching towards ordinary Germans\u2019 suffering in the second world war. H\u00f6cke\u2019s far-right stance is viewed critically within the party, with many AfD members accusing him of threatening its unity.

This Sunday, I\u2019ve had an enormously stressful but ultimately heartbreaking morning, so I\u2019m hoping for a much better afternoon. </p> <p>\u201cSpurs looked ominously good against Red Star, with Kane in particular playing some fantastic passes. I know it was \u2018only\u2019 Red Star (and they were pretty darn poor), but I\u2019m worried that Spurs may have played themselves back into some kind of form at just the wrong time. Glad to have Salah back. I hope Ox and/or Keita get a chance to come on in the second half.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db5c78a8f0859498cfb3f0f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-27T16:37:22.665Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>6 min </strong>It\u2019s been a confident, almost strutting start from Spurs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e139ac491a2f7ef76ce15a2f465639d57fece3f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e139ac491a2f7ef76ce15a2f465639d57fece3f8/167_87_2518_1632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Moussa Sissoko in action with Liverpool\u2019s Fabinho.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Moussa Sissoko in action with Liverpool\u2019s Fabinho.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-27T16:40:50.535Z\">at 4.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5db5c72d8f08142786c516ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-27T16:34:56.219Z\">4.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>4 min</strong> \u201cAs a Liverpool fan, it\u2019s the midfield that worries me,\u201d says Alex Monro. \u201cEvery team now knows to block out A-A and Robertson, which means you need creativity in the middle.

We all love a quiet, lazy day at work, and I\u2019ll elaborate on this theme as soon as I\u2019ve finished ordering a new toaster. For us normal folk, some days are much busier than others, and we\u2019d struggle to function if we had a huge deadline every time we walked into the office.</p> <p>Yet that, pretty much, is what Liverpool have had to deal with in their Premier League day job for the last 14 months. Since the start of last season they have played 47 games, knowing before each one that they could barely afford to draw, never mind lose. It\u2019s not like the old days, when title races didn\u2019t really get going until the new year. Jose Mourinho changed that culture, and Pep Guardiola has made the pace even more demanding. These days, a title race is a marathon <em>and </em>a sprint.</p> <p>Liverpool have won 38 of those 47 matches, losing just one at the Etihad Stadium in January. It\u2019s a miracle of concentration, resilience, self-belief endurance and excellence \u2013 especially as they don\u2019t yet have anything to show for it.</p> <p>All they can do, cliche fans, is take each game as it comes. Some are tougher than others - today\u2019s Champions League final reunion with Spurs, for example, has a slight whiff of danger about it. But they go into every game knowing that that sly old sage Vanilla Ice was right all along, and that anything less than the best really is a felony. </p> <p>There are no lazy days at the office coming up for Liverpool. No sickies, no holiday, no Tweetdeck, no fag breaks, no long lunches, no watercooler chit-chat, no urge-driven browsing, no early finishes. It\u2019s immensely hard work. But the potential prize - a first title since 1990, and Anfield immortality - is worth it. </p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 4.30pm</strong>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-27T15:47:53.620Z\">at 3.47pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining. Here is David Hytner\u2019s report ... Klopp: \u201cIt was a super game, I loved it. It was us at our best. \u201cThe best thing of my team today was you could not see the influence of the (Spurs) goal.\u201d The Liverpool boss goes on to praise Gazzaniga, too. Klopp says Van Dijk has a dead leg and Salah\u2019s ankle issue flared up. Kane: \u201cWe scored early on ... great start and then we dropped a little deep, soaked pressure and got to half-time. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough place to come and Liverpool are getting all those breaks at the moment.\u201d Henderson: \u201cFirst half I thought we played really well, I didn\u2019t think we started well but we reacted to the goal brilliant. We deserved a couple of goals but their goalkeeper made a couple of great saves.\u201d Peep peep! Liverpool go six points clear with a rousing and thoroughly deserved comeback victory. They were behind after 47 seconds but responded ferociously to win the match through goals from Jordan Henderson and a Mo Salah penalty. For parts of the game, they were as near to unstoppable as dammit. 90+4 min Alderweireld heads straight at Alisson! That was half a chance. 90+4 min A corner to Spurs. Gazzaniga is up. 90+3 min Divock Origi replaces Roberto Firmino, who has had a relatively quiet game. 90+2 min Son draws a smart plunging save from Alisson with a snapshot from the edge of the box. 90 min Four minutes of added time. Milner is booked for a naughty tackle on Lucas Moura. This has been a breathless match. 89 min: Rose misses a good chance to equalise. He beat the sleeping Alexander-Arnold to a long crossfield pass, came inside Gomez confidently ... and then blasted the ball over the bar with his right foot. 88 min It\u2019s now Arsenal 2-2 Crystal Palace, because Sokratis\u2019s second goal has been VARed. 88 min Christian Eriksen, who has had a stinker, is replaced by Giovani Lo Celso. 87 min Liverpool have invited pressure since going ahead, although Virgil van Dijk is still strolling round with a resting heart rate. Spurs, for all their newfound joy of possession, don\u2019t look like creating anything. 86 min Sokratis has scored his second goal to put Arsenal 3-2 up against Crystal Palace. 85 min Mo Salah leaves the field with what looks like an ankle problem. Joe Gomez replaces him. 83 min Spurs bring on Lucas Moura for poor old Serge Aurier. 82 min Rose is fouled by Alexander-Arnold, and a few Spurs players try unsuccessfully to get him sent off. It was a foul but not a second yellow card. 81 min It\u2019s now Norwich 0-3 Manchester United, with Anthony Martial scoring. 80 min Ndombele wins another corner for Spurs, who have had their best attacking spell of the entire match since going behind. Human nature is the strangest thing. 79 min Son\u2019s excellent cross from the left just clears Kane and is put behind for a corner. It\u2019s half cleared, and then Kane has a goal disallowed from Son\u2019s pass. It\u2019s the right decision - Son was offside. 78 min There is little praise too high for this Liverpool performance. They started the game 1-0 down, effectively. It took them 15 or 20 minutes to find their bearings, and since then they have been irresistible. 77 min James Milner comes on to replace Gini Wijnaldum. 77 min \u201cAmazed that you haven\u2019t mentioned how absolutely atrocious Eriksen has been,\u201d says Niall Sheerin. \u201cI was surprised to see him last the first half and can\u2019t believe Winks got hooked before him. He has given the ball away every time he\u2019s had possession and has been invisible defensively. His head\u2019s been turned, he looks like couldn\u2019t care. Get him off and out.\u201d I haven\u2019t had time! But yes, he has been abysmal. You can understand him getting the runaround from Robertson, but he has been an irrelevance with the ball. Salah danced around the ball and then blasted it low to his right. It wasn\u2019t a great penalty, in truth, but Gazzaniga stood still and that was that. Salah scores! Oh dear. Aurier did quite well to get back and dispossess Mane ... but then kicked the back of Mane\u2019s leg as he tried to clear the ball. It\u2019s a clear penalty. 74 min: PENALTY TO LIVERPOOL! This will be checked, but it looks like a moronic piece of defending from Serge Aurier. 73 min Alexander-Arnold, who has had a sensational game going forward, wins another corner. It\u2019s taken short and moved back to Henderson, who crosses too close to Gazzaniga. 72 min Ndombele is booked for this or that. 72 min After good play from Trent Alexander-Bruyne and then Mo Salah, Firmino rattles a shot that is blocked by Sanchez. 71 min Aurier\u2019s overhit cross is volleyed into the side netting by the stretching Alli. I think the ball was out of play by the time he made contact with it. 70 min Alexander-Arnold drives a left-wing corner to Salah on the edge of the area. He waits for the ball to bounce but then hooks it a few yards wide. 69 min Robertson plays a give-and-go with Mane and crosses into the six-yard area, where Sanchez does brilliantly to divert the ball behind for a corner. Robertson has beaten Eriksen with disdainful ease all day. 67 min Sissoko storms through midfield but then overhits a through pass to Son. That was a good opportunity for Spurs. 67 min But Spurs lead emphatically on clearances: 29-4, in fact. 67 min Liverpool have had 75 per cent of the possession, and 11 shots on target to Spurs\u2019 one. 66 min Salah whips a shot straight at Gazzaniga from the right side of the area. 64 min Alexander-Arnold is booked for a hack at Kane. 63 min Spurs do make a change, with Tanguy Ndombele replacing Harry Winks. That\u2019s odd as Winks has been one of their better players, although he is probably shattered from all the firefighting. 62 min I\u2019ve just remembered that Dele Alli is on the pitch. I\u2019m really surprised they haven\u2019t changed their policy of defending narrowly, because Alexander-Arnold and Robertson are running the game. Another wicked cross from Alexander-Arnold just evades Firmino. 61 min More good news for Liverpool: their beloved Roy Hodgson\u2019s Crystal Palace have equalised at the Emirates. 60 min Wijnaldum heads straight at Gazzaniga from another beautiful Alexander-Arnold cross. Just before that, he pulled that Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross at the far post but couldn\u2019t find an angle for a shot. 59 min This has been a stunning response to adversity from Liverpool. Since around the 25th minute, they have attacked with volcanic heat. 57 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s angled throw from the right somehow bounces through to Firmino, who hammers a shot at the near post from a very tight angle. It\u2019s blocked by the well-positioned Gazzaniga, who for a split-second thought it had slithered between his legs. That\u2019s his seventh or eighth save of the game. 57 min \u201cCan I get this straight,\u201d says John Potter. \u201cYou\u2019re not covering the Norwich Man U game? Is this a first? Is this official confirmation Man U are just a bog-standard team now?\u201d I think the only reason is that it\u2019s not being televised in this country. 55 min Salah\u2019s volley is straight at Gazzaniga. This game is only going one way. Spurs can\u2019t live with Liverpool\u2019s intensity. Fabinho floated a nothing ball into the area towards Firmino, who went over after a little shove from Rose. While everyone was appealing for a penalty, Henderson guided the bouncing ball into the far corner with his left foot. That\u2019s an excellent finish. Jordan Henderson equalises for Liverpool! 50 min Lovren is booked for a foul on Kane. 48 min: Son hits the bar! The chance came straight from a brilliant goalkick/pass by Gazzaniga, swished from right to left and in behind Lovren. Son ran clear, went round Alisson and lifted the ball onto the crossbar from a tight angle. 47 min: Fine save from Gazzaniga! Robertson ran at Eriksen and crossed towards the far post, where Firmino got between defenders and connected with a good downward header that was blocked desperately by Gazzaniga. 46 min Peep peep! Liverpool begin the second half. No personnel changes, although it looks like Spurs may have switched from 4-2-3-1 to 4-1-4-1. \u201cSigh,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to dislike Sundays.\u201d Trust me, you\u2019ll love them again in an hour\u2019s time. Even the nicest man in the world hates it Half-time reading Peep peep! Spurs lead through Harry Kane\u2019s first-minute goal. They started very well, not just with the goal, but were battered in the last 20 minutes with Liverpool at their high-octane best. See you soon for the second half. 45+1 min Liverpool appeal for a penalty when Mane\u2019s cross hits the shoulder of Sanchez. It was an inelegant bit of defending, but it was just about legal. 45 min Three minutes of added time. Martin Tyler reminds us that Spurs haven\u2019t won an away game in the league since January. And Liverpool haven\u2019t lost at home in the league for about two and a half years. 44 min Manchester United have now missed two penalties at Norwich - one from Rashford, one from Martial - though they still lead 2-0. If they ever learn to score penalties they\u2019ll be dangerous. 42 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s free-kick hits the top of the wall. Spurs desperately need half-time. 41 min Mane is fouled by Winks 25 yards from goal. The free-kick is slightly to the left of centre, perfect for Alexander-Arnold... 40 min There\u2019s some latent niggle in this game, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there was a red card in the second half. 38 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s long cross is clipped back in the six-yard box by Firmino, where the stretching Sanchez unwittingly stabs the ball back to his keeper Gazzaniga. 37 min Rose is booked for flattening Henderson. Spurs are angry because Sissoko had been fouled a moment earlier, but the referee waved play on. 36 min Sissoko is booked for stopping Robertson from taking a quick free-kick. Spurs have done that a few times in this half. 35 min Another goal at the Emirates: penalty fiend Luka Milivojevic has made it Arsenal 2-1 Crystal Palace. 34 min The game has changed completely. Spurs are struggling to get out of their third, never mind their half. 32 min Marcus Rashford has put Manchester United 2-0 up at Norwich. Arsenal still lead Crystal Palace 2-0. 31 min Now Mane misses a great chance, flicking a header wide from Alexander-Arnold\u2019s stunning pass. It was a brilliant ball, lofted over the defence from a very narrow position. It\u2019s almost an insult to call it a cross. Liverpool have been quite awesome in the last five minutes. 30 min Liverpool are right into their work now. Robertson surges into the box and drags the ball back towards the edge of the area. It rolls further back to Alexander-Arnold, whose thumping strike is palmed away by the diving Gazzaniga. It was a really comfortable save, although it was a superb hit from Alexander-Arnold. 29 min Gazzaniga makes another good save, leaping to tip van Dijk\u2019s close-range header over the bar. It came from a beautiful dipping free-kick by Alexander-Arnolld on the right. 27 min Gazzaniga makes a vital double save. He stretched a long way to his left to flap away Salah\u2019s rising drive from the edge of the area, then got to his feet quickly to block Firmino\u2019s follow-up. He should maybe have pushed Salah\u2019s shot behind for a corner; if it was a mistake, he redeeemed it with the second save. 27 min \u201cIs it too early,\u201d says Jim Lacoss, \u201cto substitute Lovren?\u201d I think he was taken off after 31 minutes against Spurs a couple of years ago, so it\u2019s nearly time. 26 min \u201cKane is basically a goal octopus, able to readjust his body in any direction that his predatory instincts tell him to,\u201d says Justin Kavanagh. \u201cWith his convivial bonhomie and his WWI RAF Pilot looks, he is a peculiar genius indeed.\u201d 24 min Almost a second goal for Spurs! Kane\u2019s cushioned volley is just too far in front of Alli, who would have had an open goal, and then Eriksen mishits a volley that bobbles just wide. That said, I think it might have been disallowed for offside against Kane had they scored. 23 min More good news for Matt Dony: Scott McTominay has put Manchester United 1-0 up at Carrow Road. 22 min The home fans aren\u2019t impressed with the amount of time Spurs are taking over restarts. It\u2019s a fascinating game, full of intriguing head-to-heads: Kane v Lovren, Alexander-Arnold v Son, Robertson v Eriksen. 21 min Mane heads a long punt down to Salah, who lashes the bouncing ball straight at Gazzaniga from 20 yards. Spurs break through Kane and then Son, whose cross shot is blocked by Alexander-Arnold. That was good defending. 20 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s outswinging corner is headed over by Mane, who lost Alli at the near post. The ball was moving away from him, so it wasn\u2019t much of a chance. 18 min Salah wins a corner for Liverpool, who are starting to impose themselves on Spurs. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s outswinger is headed clear, but he gets another chance to cross and wins a second corner. 17 min Aurier is down and in a bit of pain after a collision with his team-mate Alderweireld. Both teams could probably use the breather after a frantic start to the game. 14 min Robertson plays a nice give-and-go with Mane, leaves Eriksen in his slipstream and slides a low ball across the face that is claimed by Gazzaniga. 12 min Arsenal are already 2-0 up against Crystal Palace, since you asked. The goals have been scored by their centre-halves, Sokratis and David Luiz. 11 min Fabinho\u2019s long-range stinger is blocked. Liverpool haven\u2019t got going yet. 9 min Jurgen Klopp flagged before the game that Spurs like to play Son on the left against Liverpool, so that he counter-attack into the space left by the marauding Alexander-Arnold. It\u2019s a really interesting battle, that, and Son looks Spurs\u2019 biggest threat at the moment. 7 min Matt Dony isn\u2019t in a ditch after all! But he might be if this continues. \u201cAhoy hoy. Last Sunday, I had an enormously stressful but ultimately brilliant morning, then got horribly frustrated by watching United relocate their mojo and actually, y\u2019know, play some decent football. This Sunday, I\u2019ve had an enormously stressful but ultimately heartbreaking morning, so I\u2019m hoping for a much better afternoon. \u201cSpurs looked ominously good against Red Star, with Kane in particular playing some fantastic passes. I know it was \u2018only\u2019 Red Star (and they were pretty darn poor), but I\u2019m worried that Spurs may have played themselves back into some kind of form at just the wrong time. Glad to have Salah back. I hope Ox and/or Keita get a chance to come on in the second half.\u201d 6 min It\u2019s been a confident, almost strutting start from Spurs. 4 min \u201cAs a Liverpool fan, it\u2019s the midfield that worries me,\u201d says Alex Monro. \u201cEvery team now knows to block out A-A and Robertson, which means you need creativity in the middle. With Shaqiri injured and Ox benched, not sure we\u2019ve got much of that out In the middle. Basically, we should have bought Eriksen!\u201d I think that\u2019s a bit harsh on Fabinho in particular. Much as I love Eriksen, I\u2019m not sure he would get into this Liverpool team. 3 min Spurs have started in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Eriksen on the right and Son on the left. That\u2019s where the game came from. He ran at Alexander-Arnold, cut back infield and hit a speculative shot that ultimately led to the goal. Sissoko also played his part with a surging run through midfield and a pass to Son. Kane was onside and Spurs are ahead! Son cut inside Henderson, onto his right foot, and whacked a 20-yard shot that took a big deflection off the head of Lovren and flew onto the near post. It rebounded to Kane, who stooped to steer a header wide of Alisson from eight yards. That\u2019s a deceptively good finish. I thought Kane might have been offside when Son had the shot, but he was played on by Virgil van Dijk. This might be disallowed for offside. 14 seconds Mane is almost put through on goal by Firmino. With a better first touch, he would have been clear. 1 min Peep peep! Spurs, in which, kick off from left to right. Liverpool are in red. There\u2019s a belting atmosphere at Anfield, with a particularly lusty rendition on You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone preceding the match. An email! \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cIt\u2019s not been a great day so far for teams wearing red. Wales, Aberdeen, Cardiff (well they used to wear red, for a bit), Bristol City. This is the kind of analysis you only find on the MBM. Hashtag just saying. I hope Matt Dony is ok.\u201d Given his emails before, during and after Wales\u2019 Euro 2016 semi-final, and his silence today, I\u2019m slightly worried about his joie de vivre levels. Liverpool are three points clear of Manchester City with this game in hand. Their next home match, a fortnight today, is against City. Spurs start the matcn in 10th place and could, depending on results elsewhere, finish the day anywhere between sixth and 14th. Newcastle 1-1 Wolves was the final score in the early Premier League game, a decent enough result for both sides. Pre-match reading Liverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Mane. Substitutes: Adrian, Milner, Keita, Gomez, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Origi. Tottenham Hotspur (4-D-2) Gazzaniga; Aurier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Rose; Winks; Sissoko, Eriksen; Alli; Son, Kane. Substitutes: Austin, Davies, Vertonghen, Dier, Ndombele, Lo Celso, Lucas Moura. Referee Anthony Taylor. Hello. We all love a quiet, lazy day at work, and I\u2019ll elaborate on this theme as soon as I\u2019ve finished ordering a new toaster. For us normal folk, some days are much busier than others, and we\u2019d struggle to function if we had a huge deadline every time we walked into the office. Yet that, pretty much, is what Liverpool have had to deal with in their Premier League day job for the last 14 months. Since the start of last season they have played 47 games, knowing before each one that they could barely afford to draw, never mind lose. It\u2019s not like the old days, when title races didn\u2019t really get going until the new year. Jose Mourinho changed that culture, and Pep Guardiola has made the pace even more demanding. These days, a title race is a marathon and a sprint. Liverpool have won 38 of those 47 matches, losing just one at the Etihad Stadium in January. It\u2019s a miracle of concentration, resilience, self-belief endurance and excellence \u2013 especially as they don\u2019t yet have anything to show for it. All they can do, cliche fans, is take each game as it comes. Some are tougher than others - today\u2019s Champions League final reunion with Spurs, for example, has a slight whiff of danger about it. But they go into every game knowing that that sly old sage Vanilla Ice was right all along, and that anything less than the best really is a felony. There are no lazy days at the office coming up for Liverpool. No sickies, no holiday, no Tweetdeck, no fag breaks, no long lunches, no watercooler chit-chat, no urge-driven browsing, no early finishes. It\u2019s immensely hard work. But the potential prize - a first title since 1990, and Anfield immortality - is worth it. Kick off is at 4.30pm.",

Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go.\u201d At more recent moments in Britain\u2019s past, Cromwell\u2019s words have been called into service once again by later generations, most famously by <a href=\"http://www.ukpol.co.uk/leo-amery-1940-speech-in-the-house-of-commons/\" title=\"\">Leo Amery</a> in the 1940 Norway debate in a speech attacking Neville Chamberlain\u2019s handling of the war with Germany, which ended with those selfsame Cromwellian phrases and which helped trigger Winston Churchill\u2019s arrival in Downing Street three days later.</p> <p>It is more than possible that Boris Johnson, a tinpot Churchill now auditioning to be a tinpot Cromwell, may invoke those words yet again when he calls for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/24/boris-johnson-to-ask-mps-to-back-pre-christmas-election\" title=\"\">general election</a> in the House of Commons on Monday. Last Friday, Mr Johnson summoned his inner Cromwell and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50174402\" title=\"\">told the BBC</a> that the British people must be \u201creleased from subjection to a parliament that has outlived its usefulness\u201d. In a parallel briefing, No 10 was <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/10/24/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-set-push-christmas-election/\" title=\"\">even more blunt</a>, telling reporters: \u201cIf parliament refuses to allow Brexit and refuses to allow an election, then what\u2019s the point of parliament?\u201d</p> <p>Well, here\u2019s the point of parliament. And here\u2019s the point of this one. The <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/civilwar/overview/\" title=\"\">Long Parliament</a> had sat for 13 years when Cromwell called for it to go. The current parliament has not yet sat for two and a half, which is less than half of its term. It is not even close to outliving its usefulness. Contrary to Downing Street\u2019s lies, this parliament does not refuse to allow Brexit. Indeed it voted for Brexit only last week in the shape of the withdrawal agreement bill. But this parliament does not want Britain to be bundled out of the EU with no deal or on terms that threaten jobs, the economy, peace in Northern Ireland or the union with Scotland.

      "bodyText": "Oliver Cromwell\u2019s speech attacking the Long Parliament in 1653 has gone down in history. \u201cYou have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go.\u201d At more recent moments in Britain\u2019s past, Cromwell\u2019s words have been called into service once again by later generations, most famously by Leo Amery in the 1940 Norway debate in a speech attacking Neville Chamberlain\u2019s handling of the war with Germany, which ended with those selfsame Cromwellian phrases and which helped trigger Winston Churchill\u2019s arrival in Downing Street three days later. It is more than possible that Boris Johnson, a tinpot Churchill now auditioning to be a tinpot Cromwell, may invoke those words yet again when he calls for a general election in the House of Commons on Monday. Last Friday, Mr Johnson summoned his inner Cromwell and told the BBC that the British people must be \u201creleased from subjection to a parliament that has outlived its usefulness\u201d. In a parallel briefing, No 10 was even more blunt, telling reporters: \u201cIf parliament refuses to allow Brexit and refuses to allow an election, then what\u2019s the point of parliament?\u201d Well, here\u2019s the point of parliament. And here\u2019s the point of this one. The Long Parliament had sat for 13 years when Cromwell called for it to go. The current parliament has not yet sat for two and a half, which is less than half of its term. It is not even close to outliving its usefulness. Contrary to Downing Street\u2019s lies, this parliament does not refuse to allow Brexit. Indeed it voted for Brexit only last week in the shape of the withdrawal agreement bill. But this parliament does not want Britain to be bundled out of the EU with no deal or on terms that threaten jobs, the economy, peace in Northern Ireland or the union with Scotland. This government does not care about any of these things. This parliament should absolutely refuse to be bullied out of existence, least of all by such a government. It should be clear, as this newspaper is clear, that Mr Johnson\u2019s sole aim is to achieve a Conservative majority that would scrap all of this parliament\u2019s hard-won efforts to soften Brexit and would replace them with a deregulatory wilderness that would be catastrophic for our people. This parliament must stay in place to stop this. As so often, the truth is the opposite of what Mr Johnson says. This parliament, elected in 2017 when Theresa May tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to get a large majority for her hard-Brexit terms, has plenty of usefulness left in its tank. This parliament has had to develop a uniquely detailed knowledge of the issues and implications involved in Brexit.

Local volunteers joined expats, tourists and Cambodian officials including police officers, divers and soldiers in searching for Bambridge. Three government boats aided the sea search, while people scoured terrain on foot and motorbikes. Linda Schultes, Bambridge\u2019s mother, arrived in Cambodia from the UK and is expected to land on Koh Rong on Monday morning. Her father, Phil Bambridge, arrived on the island after travelling from Vietnam, where he lives, on Sunday night. On Wednesday, Bambridge, who travelled to Cambodia alone but forged friendships with other backpackers, left the Nest Beach Club hostel on Koh Rong, where she had been staying, and attended a party on the small, privately run Police Beach. She was last seen by friends at about 3am on Thursday at the party. Concern was raised when Bambridge failed to check out of the hostel and meet a friend to catch a ferry. Her backpack, containing items including her bank cards, cash, phone and headphones, was found on rocks by Police Beach later on Thursday morning.

The only way by which a new leader could be installed in time to fight the imminent election would be if Corbyn resigned, but there is one very good reason why, at the moment, this is simply not going to happen. That is because Tom Watson would become the caretaker leader and in all likelihood fight the election as the prospective next prime minister.

She told the impeachment inquiry her boss had been so alarmed by efforts by the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others to run a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/14/fiona-hill-testimony-trump-impeachment-inquiry\">rogue foreign policy</a> in Ukraine, designed to dig up dirt against Biden, that Bolton had instructed Hill to alert White House lawyers.</p> <p>\u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal\u201d was being cooked up, Bolton is reported to have said. According to Hill, he also attacked Giuliani as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up\u201d.</p> <p>By swinging the focus on to Bolton, Schiff indicated that Democratic leaders have no intention of allowing the patriotic glow around the killing of the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to knock them off course in their pursuit of Trump.</p> <p>Schiff implied that any attempt to block Bolton\u2019s appearance before closed-door impeaching hearings would merely delay the start of open public proceedings in the impeachment process \u2013 a key demand of the White House and Republicans.</p> <p>Bolton\u2019s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, filed a lawsuit on Friday asking a judge to determine if he should comply with a subpoena to testify before the House committees as scheduled on Monday. The move was widely seen as a delaying manoeuvre.</p> <p>If Trump had been hoping that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-isis-leader-killed-us-donald-trump\">successful mission</a> to take out Baghdadi would deflect public attention from the gathering impeachment storm and on to a rare foreign policy victory, he would not have been satisfied for long. Even amid a rash of positive comment about the raid on the Sunday political shows, discussion soon reverted to Trump\u2019s troubles.</p> <p>Vice-President Mike Pence was confronted with a question about impeachment from Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. He sought to present the image of Trump as commander-in-chief of US forces pulling off a dangerous mission in Syria as a counterpoint to his beleaguered domestic position.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What the American people have seen in the last 12 hours \u2026 is that President Trump has never stopped fighting</p> <footer> <cite>Mike Pence</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cDemocrats have been pursuing impeachment by and large for the past three years,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWhat the American people have seen in the last 12 hours \u2026 is that President Trump has never stopped fighting to keep the promises we made in the election in 2016.\u201d</p> <p>Pence went on to insist that \u201cthere was no quid pro quo \u2013 the president did nothing wrong\u201d. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/22/us-ambassador-bill-taylor-ukraine-trump-military-aid-biden\">devastating evidence</a> has emerged through the impeachment hearings that Trump used the leverage of a Washington summit meeting and almost $400m of military aide to Ukraine to force Kyiv into investigating Biden and other political opponents.</p> <p>Among the damning evidence is a statement from Trump\u2019s own current chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/oct/17/donald-trump-news-today-impeachment-inquiry-gordon-sondland-ukraine-news-live\">confirmed that there had been a quid pro quo</a>, with military aid withheld.

      "bodyText": "Democratic leaders of the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump are gearing up for an epic tug-of-war with the White House over their desire to call the former national security adviser John Bolton to testify. Bolton, who was ousted by Trump in September, is seen by Democrats as a key witness who could prove critical in nailing the president for corruptly leaning on Ukraine to help in his re-election campaign. The former national security adviser is reported to have expressed deep misgivings about Trump\u2019s attempts to cajole Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate and potential rival. Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee who is spearheading the impeachment inquiry, said on Sunday the spotlight was now falling squarely on Bolton. Speaking on ABC\u2019s This Week, he accused the White House of obstructing proceedings by attempting to block the testimony of current and former officials, adding: \u201cMy guess is they are going to fight us having John Bolton in.\u201d Schiff described Bolton as a \u201cvery important witness \u2026 He has a wealth of information and we do want him to come in and testify.\u201d Schiff pointed to the previous testimony of a former aide to Bolton, Fiona Hill. She told the impeachment inquiry her boss had been so alarmed by efforts by the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others to run a rogue foreign policy in Ukraine, designed to dig up dirt against Biden, that Bolton had instructed Hill to alert White House lawyers. \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal\u201d was being cooked up, Bolton is reported to have said. According to Hill, he also attacked Giuliani as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up\u201d. By swinging the focus on to Bolton, Schiff indicated that Democratic leaders have no intention of allowing the patriotic glow around the killing of the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to knock them off course in their pursuit of Trump. Schiff implied that any attempt to block Bolton\u2019s appearance before closed-door impeaching hearings would merely delay the start of open public proceedings in the impeachment process \u2013 a key demand of the White House and Republicans. Bolton\u2019s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, filed a lawsuit on Friday asking a judge to determine if he should comply with a subpoena to testify before the House committees as scheduled on Monday. The move was widely seen as a delaying manoeuvre. If Trump had been hoping that the successful mission to take out Baghdadi would deflect public attention from the gathering impeachment storm and on to a rare foreign policy victory, he would not have been satisfied for long. Even amid a rash of positive comment about the raid on the Sunday political shows, discussion soon reverted to Trump\u2019s troubles. Vice-President Mike Pence was confronted with a question about impeachment from Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. He sought to present the image of Trump as commander-in-chief of US forces pulling off a dangerous mission in Syria as a counterpoint to his beleaguered domestic position. \u201cDemocrats have been pursuing impeachment by and large for the past three years,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWhat the American people have seen in the last 12 hours \u2026 is that President Trump has never stopped fighting to keep the promises we made in the election in 2016.\u201d Pence went on to insist that \u201cthere was no quid pro quo \u2013 the president did nothing wrong\u201d. In fact, devastating evidence has emerged through the impeachment hearings that Trump used the leverage of a Washington summit meeting and almost $400m of military aide to Ukraine to force Kyiv into investigating Biden and other political opponents. Among the damning evidence is a statement from Trump\u2019s own current chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who earlier this month confirmed that there had been a quid pro quo, with military aid withheld. Hours later he tried to retract the statement. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, told Fox News Sunday the Isis raid would have no impact on the impeachment proceedings. \u201cWe still expect the president to carry out his duties and we are going to continue to hold him to account,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can be compartmentalized. We are not concerned about what he did with this Isis raid, we are concerned with the extortion scheme that it looks like he led with the Ukrainians.\u201d Before news of the Baghdadi raid broke on Saturday night, another of Trump\u2019s former top aides, John Kelly, further added to his travails by saying he had warned the president about the danger of impeachment. Speaking at an event staged by the conservative Washington Examiner, the former White House chief of staff said that when he left the post he had advised Trump: \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t hire a \u2018yes man\u2019 \u2013 someone who won\u2019t tell you the truth.\u201d Kelly added that he had given that counsel \u201cbecause if you do, I believe you will be impeached\u201d. Trump disputed the claim, lashing back at Kelly in a statement to CNN that \u201cJohn Kelly never said that \u2026 If he would have said that I would have thrown him out of the office.\u201d A statement from the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, attracted widespread ridicule. \u201cI worked with John Kelly,\u201d Grisham said, \u201cand he was totally unequipped to handle the genius of our great president.\u201d.",

At an auction outside Paris on Sunday, the unsigned work, measuring just 26cm by 20cm, fetched \u20ac19.5m under the hammer, rising to over \u20ac24m when fees were included. The Act\u00e9on auction house in Senlis said in a statement that the sale was the biggest for a medieval painting and the eighth highest for a medieval or old master painting. The painting now ranks alongside works by Leonardo da Vinci, Rubens, Rembrandt and Raphael in the top 10 of most expensive old painting sales. \u201cWhen a unique work of a painter as rare as Cimabue comes to market, you have to be ready for surprises,\u201d said Dominique Le Coent, who heads the Act\u00e9on auction house in Senlis. \u201cThis is the only Cimabue that has ever come on the market.\u201d As 800 people gathered in the auction hall in Senlis, the crowd fell silent during the nail-biting final moments of bidding. Some bids came in by telephone to agents. As the auctioneer brandished his hammer as the price crept up, he said: \u201cThere will never be another Cimabue at auction.\u201d Act\u00e9on did not reveal the identity of the buyer but said a foreign museum had been among the bidders. The painting had hung on the kitchen wall for so long that the woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told the auction house she had no idea where it had come from or how it had come into the family\u2019s hands. Cimabue, also known as Cenni di Pepo, was one of the pioneering artists of the early Italian Renaissance. Only 11 works painted on wood have been attributed to him, none of them signed. Art experts at Turquin in Paris used infrared reflectography to confirm that the piece was part of a larger diptych from 1280, when Cimabue painted eight scenes of the passion and crucifixion of Christ. Each of the two panels in the diptych had four scenes. Two scenes from the same diptych, known as The Virgin and Child with Two Angels and The Flagellation of Christ, already hang in the National Gallery in London and the Frick Collection in New York. Cimabue, who taught the Italian master Giotto, is widely considered the forefather of the Italian Renaissance. He broke from the Byzantine style popular in the Middle Ages and began to incorporate elements of movement and perspective that came to characterise western painting. The National Gallery described Cimabue\u2019s work as representing \u201ca crucial moment in the history of art\u201d when Italian painters, while still influenced by Byzantine painting, were exploring the naturalistic depiction of forms and three-dimensional space. In June, when the woman decided to sell her house and move away, an expert at the Senlis auctioneers was contacted to look at the contents of the house in case some of it could be sold. \u201cI had a week to give an expert view on the house contents and empty it,\u201d Philom\u00e8ne Wolf told Le Parisien last month. \u201cI had to make room in my schedule \u2026 if I didn\u2019t, then everything was due to go to the dump.\u201d Wolf said she noticed the painting as soon as she entered the house. \u201cYou rarely see something of such quality. I immediately thought it was a work of Italian primitivism. But I didn\u2019t imagine it was a Cimabue.\u201d The auctioneer, who began her job at the auction house only last year, suggested that the woman bring the painting to experts for an evaluation. She initially thought there might be a sale price of \u20ac300,000-\u20ac400,000, until art expert valued it at millions. About 100 other objects from the house were sold for around \u20ac6,000 and the remaining furniture and decorations were disposed of at the local dump.",

Families reported cases including an 11-year-old child with a disability being suicidal, another under 12 hiding from school bullies in a rubbish bin, and a child between seven and nine years old who was \u201cleft briefly in a hot school taxi and felt scared that he couldn\u2019t get out\u201d. Mary Sayers, the CYDA chief executive, said the report uncovered children with disabilities were regularly bullied by other students, and at times by school staff, as well as the common use of restrictive practices. \u201cThe overarching message we have from the survey is that there is severe abuse and neglect of students with disability in school,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. Nearly half (48.2%) of students with disability experienced bullying at school in the past year, including 9.1% who said school staff had been the bullies. The use of restraints and seclusion was reported by nearly a third of respondents (30%). Most commonly, students were physically restrained, but a small number of families also reported the use of chemical restraints. About one in five children with a disability had been placed in seclusion, such as solitary confinement with and without supervision in a room, classroom or staff office. \u201cOften schools we hear are using this as a behaviour management technique, rather than actually looking at, well, \u2018What would it take to have this child included in the classroom?\u201d Sayers told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhat it points to is that schools need to really be committed to inclusive education.\u201d In 2015, news that schools in Canberra were using metal cages to detain students with autism provoked national outrage. The report found 40% of students with disabilities had been excluded from events or activities, while 15.5% of students who attended a mainstream school said they were separated from peers in a special unit, either permanently or at times. In addition, about 15% of students with disabilities had been suspended from school and 12.5% of parents said their children been refused enrolment, the survey found. One family of a young child in rural Western Australia told the survey: \u201cI applied to 36 schools in WA, have attended four, which two have removed him and three would not meet his needs and assaulted him.\u201d Another said their child had been suspended 60 out of 150 days in the first three terms last year. Sayers called for the government to adopt a national inclusive education plan that would phase out special schools and separated classrooms/units within mainstream schools. Under the plan, teaching students would also take a mandatory semester subject at university to train them to better work with students with disabilities. It comes as the royal commission into violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with disability prepares to hold its first public hearings in early November. The commission is expected to examine issues raised in the report. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Other international suicide helplines can be found at befrienders.org",

Let\u2019s start with Taylor\u2019s past use of language when the Greens began asking whether he had intervened with the environment department in relation to an investigation of a Taylor family-owned company, Jam Land, for alleged illegal land clearing.

      "bodyText": "More than 240 conservation scientists have called on Scott Morrison to drop his opposition to stronger environment laws and seize a \u201conce-in-a-decade opportunity\u201d to fix a system that is failing to stem a worsening extinction crisis. With the federal government due to this week announce a 10-yearly legislated review of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act, the scientists have signed an open letter to the prime minister urging him to increase spending and back laws to help protect the natural world from further destruction. The letter says three native species have become extinct in the past decade and another 17 could follow in the next 20 years. More than 1,800 Australian plants and animals are formally listed as threatened with extinction, but the scientists say this is an underestimate. \u201cOur current laws are failing because they are too weak, have inadequate review and approval processes, and are not overseen by an effective compliance regime,\u201d the scientists say. \u201cSince they were established (in 1999), 7.7m hectares of threatened species habitat has been destroyed. That\u2019s an area larger than Tasmania. Meanwhile, the number of extinctions continue to climb, while new threats emerge and spread unchecked.\u201d Environmental law was a point of difference at this year\u2019s election, with Morrison pledging to limit \u201cgreen tape\u201d that he said cost jobs while Labor promised a new environment act and a federal environment protection authority. Lesley Hughes, a distinguished professor of biology at Macquarie University, member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists and a signatory to the letter, said environmental protections had been consistently wound back over the past decade, most often by conservative governments. She said it was having a significant impact, pointing to the 2016 state-of-the-environment report that found Australia was facing multiple environment changes and lacked a national policy that established a clear vision for the protection and sustainable management of the country\u2019s natural heritage. She also cited a WWF assessment that ranked eastern Australia as one of the world\u2019s top 11 deforestation hotspots. Australia was the only developed country on the list. \u201cIt\u2019s a very grim picture,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThis letter is a pre-emptive strike to say this is an opportunity to do it better, this is not an opportunity to weaken and dilute the existing weak laws.\u201d Morrison\u2019s pledge not to increase environmental laws came as a United Nations global assessment found biodiversity was declining at an unprecedented rate, with one million species across the globe at risk of extinction and human populations in jeopardy if the trajectory was not reversed. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the review of the EPBC Act was an independent process that would encourage submissions from a wide variety of perspectives. She said the government was investing significantly in environmental restoration and land care programs to promote biodiversity and safe havens for native species. She announced the Indigenous protected area network, areas of land and sea owned or managed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups, would be expanded by 28% to more than 100m hectares, an area similar to the size of South Australia. A Guardian investigation last year found most campaigners and political veterans believed environmental protection was now harder to win in Australia than at any time since before the wave of landmark 1980s decisions to save Tasmania\u2019s Franklin River, recognise the Daintree rainforest and Kakadu national park and to block mining in Antarctica. Less than 40% of nationally-listed threatened species had recovery plans in place to secure their long-term survival. The federal environment department admitted earlier this year it did not know whether the recovery plans that were in place were being implemented. Conservation groups found spending on the environment department has been cut by nearly 40% since the Coalition was elected in 2013. The review of the EPBC Act will be held against a backdrop of escalating land-clearing, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales. Business groups have regularly called for the environmental approval process to be simplified to stop delays to major projects. The scientists\u2019 letter was organised by the Australian Conservation Foundation and is backed by the the Places You Love Alliance, a collection of 57 organisations including BirdLife Australia, Humane Society International and WWF Australia. The letter calls for laws that \u201csafeguard our intact ecosystems and protect the critical areas people and wildlife need to survive\u201d. Suzanne Milthorpe, nature campaign manager with the Wilderness Society, urged the government to use the review to upgrade the EPBC Act from a piece of legislation that catalogued the loss of nature into one that helps prevent it. \u201cExtinction is a choice,\u201d she said.",

Though a weak student, whose poor eyesight disqualified him from joining the Iraqi military, he rose to command al-Qaeda\u2019s Iraqi division and then broke away to form&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a>&nbsp;(Isis).</p>\n    <p>In July 2014, shortly after Isis said it had established a caliphate in Iraq and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a>, Baghdadi delivered a sermon from a mosque in the captured Iraqi city of Mosul. Appearing unmasked for the first time, he declared himself to be the caliph: the political and religious leader of the global Muslim community.</p>\n    <p>His declaration was roundly rejected by almost all Islamic religious authorities but his caliphate became a magnet for thousands of foreign fighters and women. The group attempted not just to hold territory but to administer it like a state, establishing a brutal justice system, collecting taxes and doling out public services.</p>\n    <p>Baghdadi had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/29/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-appears-in-video-for-first-time-in-five-years\">been seen publicly</a>&nbsp;on one other occasion, in an 18-minute video released in April this year. From 2016 he had a $25m bounty on his head.</p>\n    <p>He had been reported to have suffered serious injuries in airstrikes over the years, and there had occasionally been speculation that he had been killed, but he&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/28/isis-releases-new-recording-of-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi\">continued to resurface</a>&nbsp;in audio tapes and videos.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company. Here is Suzanne Wrack\u2019s report. Cushing: \u201cAnother game where we didn\u2019t really create anything clear. \u201cI don\u2019t think they were playing at the level they can.\u201d The City manager adds that he has to get back onto the training ground where they can put things right. Montemurro: \u201cThis is a difficult league and it\u2019s a marathon and you have to come up with all different styles and ways. \u201cI think the collective will when we didn\u2019t have the ball was very good, we knew our roles, there was a lot of sacrificing. They are a very good team will fine pockets but we stopped them.\u201d Here is the only goal of the game ... Walti says it was a tough game and it is very important to bounce back from the loss to Chelsea. She then receives the player of the match report. Arsenal were just more efficient on the day as it was certainly not a classic. Miedema took the best chance of the game, while City failed to create a decent opportunity throughout. City\u2019s perfect record has ended and they will need to improve if they are to beat Atletico Madrid in midweek, that\u2019s for sure. 90+2 mins: Miedema takes the ball off Houghton and runs through on goal before laying it off to Nobbs in acres of space but she uncharacteristically drags her shot wide from 12 yards out. City then go down the other end and win a corner. Stanway sends it into the box but Houghton is adjudged to have fouled the \u2018keeper. 90 mins: Campbell tries to run the ball out from defence but takes a bad touch and is dispossessed, allowing Arsenal to run the ball into the corner to waste time. Five minutes added on. 88 mins: City are finally showing some level on intent, which is refreshing. Hemp forces her way into the box and goes down under pressure but there is no suggestion it\u2019s a penalty. 86 mins: White finally gets involved, latching onto a ball in the channel and taking it into the box where Bremer picks up the pieces and eventually earns a corner. Despite a couple of good crosses into the box, Arsenal hold on and clear it. 84 mins: Evans pulls the back to Nobbs on the edge of the box who whacks a first-time shot which hits Campbell on the side. Nobbs is inexplicably convinced it is a handball and gives the referee her view but nothing is happening as it\u2019s not handball in a million years. 82 mins: Ellen White has been on for almost 20 minutes and is yet to have a touch of the ball. City have been dreadful going forward, they have just never played at a sufficient tempo to trouble Arsenal. 80 mins: Mead pings a corner to the back post via the head of Houghton but Miedema controls the cross with her hand and is belatedly penalised. Mead is then cleaned out by Bonner when trying to turn the City defender, who is rightly cautioned. 78 mins: Arsenal a cross into the box but it is headed away once more. 76 mins: A flowing move from Arsenal sees McCabe flick the ball through to Nobbs who looks level and then fires a low shot at goal but Roebuck gets down to it and holds on. 74 mins: Little lifts the ball into the area and Nobbs volleys first time, the contact is not perfect and her effort loops wide. An answer to my white ball question ... 72 mins: Scott pushes over Van de Donk when running at the City defence. Mead takes the resulting free-kick to Little, who chips the ball into the box from a bad angle and City head clear. 69 mins: City have two new strikers on the pitch and they have no interest in putting pressure on the Arsenal defence either. 67 mins: Weir tries to dissect the defence but her pass trickles through to Zinsberger, which at least gives her something to do. 65 mins: City are really feeling Walsh\u2019s absence; the midfielder is the team\u2019s best passer of the ball and without her they have failed to get anything going in the middle of the park. Ellen White is finally on for City. 63 mins: Stokes lifts in a cross which Hemp heads high and wide. City then allow Arsenal to walk the ball out from the back. Surely they need to press better than that?! 61 mins: City bring on Campbell and Bremer with Hidalgo and Wullaert. Hopefully this will provide the energy required to bring City back into this match as they look pretty lethargic. 59 mins: Little catches Houghton when she intercepts a pass. The City skipper is in pain as she receives treatment. It seems to be an ankle issue but she eventually gets up and looks OK to continue. 57 mins: It\u2019s great that City want to pass the ball around at the back but there has to be some sort of purpose to it, as it\u2019s currently getting them nowhere. 55 mins: Mead nutmegs Hidalgo to instigate an attack which ends with a cross being cleared by Houghton. City still looking underwhelming and they really need to make a change to get back into this. 53 mins: McCabe makes contact with Hidalgo when trying to go round the City full-back but the referee gives nothing, which is fair enough. 51 mins: Scott gets the ball on the halfway line and sends it all the way back to the goalkeeper for some reason. 49 mins: Weir whacks a shot which Nobbs blocks but she goes down in pain having hurt her ankle. How long will Cushing wait until bringing on White? I will say the hour mark. 47 mins: Manchester City have been a bit thick today. Bonner tackles Miedema as she runs through, with the ball going straight to Roebuck who decides to pass it to Houghton inside her own six-yard box, only for the skipper to pass it back to her goalkeeper. Arsenal put the pressure on and City are lucky to earn a free-kick. City need to be more intelligent in such situations. Here we go again! The sun is an issue ... It was a pretty mundane half until Arsenal capitalised on City\u2019s two centre-backs being in the wrong place. City really need to up their game after the break as they have underwhelmed for a team in such good form. 45 mins: Miedema now has her first goal against City in the WSL, aided by Bonner being well out of position. One minute added on. City concede their first league goal of the season! Little picks up the ball 30 yards from goal and slips it through to Miedema who is played onside by Houghton who is far too deep, allowing the striker to firing beyond Roebuck from 12 yards. 42 mins: Neither goalkeeper has been tested in this game so far. The clocks have gone back but thy are still using a white ball in this match, rather than the wintry yellow one, which is now operating in the Premier League. Why is this? 40 mins: Stanway is adjudged to have fouled McCabe on the left after the defender tried to put in a cross. It looks very soft. Mead swings in the free-kick but Houghton is in the right place and heads clear. 38 mins: The game has slowed back down. I think the centre-backs have completed the most passes so far. 36 mins: City play themselves into trouble with some pitiful passing around the back, culminating in Bonner sending one back to Roebuck lacking sufficient pace, giving Mead a sniff but the goalkeeper just does enough and tackles the Arsenal player and winning a City a goal-kick in the process. City need to be more pragmatic in their own defensive third. 34 mins: It is starting to look like a game that neither team want to lose, which does not make for an entertaining encounter. Mead aims to beat Stokes down the right flank, succeeds in doing so but then decides to go past her again and loses the ball in a good position. 32 mins: It looks like Hemp has run the ball out of play, resulting in the Arsenal team stopping but the assistant does not flag and play carries on until the Gunners wake up and win the ball back. 30 mins: The tempo is briefly lifted when City try to break through on the edge of the box but fail. Scott then slides into Miedema to reclaim possession, much to the Dutch international\u2019s chagrin and she appeals for a foul but nothing is happening. Scott then earns a chance but her shot is weak and straight at the \u2018keeper. 28 mins: City are just slowly passing the ball around at the back, which is great for the stats but is getting them nowhere. If they knocked it about with a bit more intensity they might be able to open up some space. Arsenal must be laughing at them. 26 mins: If someone told me one of these teams had won all four league games this season without conceding, I would have it was Arsenal. City really aren\u2019t in this at the moment. 24 mins: Fidalgo brings down Mead as she attempts to go round her. The Portuguese international, who is making her first WSL start, is Bernardo Silva\u2019s second cousin. 22 mins: The hosts seem to have had the ball for the last five minutes or so but mainly between the centre circle and City box without doing too much with it. They need to increase the intensity in the final third if they are to open City up. 20 mins: Arsenal enjoy some calm buildup, eventually working it well out to Evans who bursts into the box and cuts onto her left foot but can only lift her shot just over the bar. 18 mins: Nobbs is dispossessed by Hemp deep in the City half, allowing the youngster to instigate a counter attack until she is muscled off the ball. 16 mins: Manchester City\u2019s official Twitter account have just referred to this game as \u201ccagey\u201d by which I assume they mean not very good. 14 mins: Evans gets down the right wing and pings a cross to the front post where Mead is making a run but she just cannot get there and Roebuck gets down to claim. 12 mins: Both teams have offered some decent buildup play but just can\u2019t find that crucial final pass to create a notable chance. Saying that ... Miedema makes her own chance, picking up the ball 20 yards from goal, turning and then curling a shot just over the bar. 10 mins: It\u2019s an exciting game for Phil Neville with two of his England centre-backs facing one another. Arsenal\u2019s Leah Williamson is one of the best in the WSL thanks to her calm nature and intelligence on the pitch, while Steph Houghton is a great leader and marshals the City defence, while also possessing a great passing range. 8 mins: Arsenal look the more comfortable here and are doing their best to control the tempo. 6 mins: Beattie whacks a perfect cross-field pass out to Van de Donk, who takes control of it but fails to find enough space to get a cross in and is dispossessed. City put in a couple of robust challenges, from Stanway and then Weir and the referee blows for the first one. 4 mins: Little seems to lose her bearings and passes the ball straight to Stanway on the edge of the Arsenal box but the home defence recovers to crowd her out and avoid any danger. 2 mins: Arsenal dominate the early stages in terms of possession but it\u2019s mainly just passing it around the middle of the park. City\u2019s light blue shirts are getting lost in the sun a bit. Peep! Peep! Peep! Let\u2019s get ready to rumble. Nick Cushing: \u201cWhen you have the opportunity to go six points clear, you have to come here and try to win.\u201d It looks like there is a decent crowd in at Meadow Park, which is great to see. The Arsenal fans usually create a decent atmosphere in Borehamwood. Manchester City have a 100 per cent record in the league this season and they will not be keen to give that up today. Arsenal have lost just one of their opening four fixtures, that coming against Chelsea. Another cracking story from this week ... Pre-match stats ... Janine Beckie certainly looks very pleased to be starting ... It\u2019s a perfect day for football in London; the sun is out, the skies are clear and the temperature is delightfully mild, so it should suit everyone involved. Louise Taylor points out how big a game this really is. Good news for both teams as Miedema is deemed fit to start and City finally have Ellen White available, although she only makes the bench. Arsenal: Zinsberger, Evans, Williamson, Beattie, McCabe, Walti, Little, Nobbs, Miedema, Mead, Van de Donk Subs: Peyraud-Magnin, Quinn, Mitchell, Maier, Roord, Veje Man City: Roebuck, Fidalgo, Houghton (C), Bonner, Stokes, Scott, Weir, Wullaert, Hemp, Beckie, Stanway. Subs: Benameur, Campbell, Bremer, Toland, Park, Geum-Min, White. Good afternoon! Manchester City are top of the league and will be looking to keep themselves there after their visit to Arsenal. It might be early in the season but the result here could have a lasting impact on their campaigns. Nick Cushing\u2019s side lost just once last season, it just happens that Arsenal the team to inflict it on the final of day of the season. He will be hoping his City side will be keen on revenge in north London. The City boss could be boosted by a potential Ellen White debut. The summer signing is yet to feature for the club due to injury but she is finally closing in on fitness. Someone else who has a fitness concern is Arsenal forward Vivienne Miedema, who facing a late test to see if she can play. Should be an interesting game, that\u2019s for sure. Kick off: 2.30pm GMT",

The US president confirmed reports that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been killed in a US raid. Here is what we learned:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Trump watched from<strong> </strong>the White House situation room as US special operations forces carried out a nighttime raid on a compound in north western Syria yesterday. He said the operation started at around 5pm US time and it was \u201clike watching a movie\u201d. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>No US personnel were killed, but \u201ca large number of Baghdadi\u2019s fighters and companions were killed with him\u201d. Trump said they would announce the exact number of deaths in due course.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Baghdadi died after running into a dead-end tunnel with three of his children, \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way\u201d, said Trump. He detonated a suicide vest, bringing the tunnel down around him and killing himself and the three children. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>A DNA test was done immediately, confirming his identity. \u201cIt was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread,\u201d said Trump.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Trump said they had had Baghdadi under surveillance for a couple of weeks. The US landed with eight helicopters at the compound and blew holes in the side of the building, avoiding the main door because they knew it was boobytrapped.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Trump said that two of Baghdadi\u2019s wives were killed. They were wearing suicide vests, which were never detonated.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The US president said 11 children were removed from the compound alive and some people surrendered. He would not say how many survivors there were, but he said there were \u201cmore dead than alive\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>US forces were in the compound for two hours and seized \u201chighly sensitive material and information\u201d on Isis, said Trump.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The president thanked the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq and the Syrian Kurds for their cooperation. He said that one of the most dangerous aspects of the mission was the flight in and the flight out. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The US helicopters were shot at as they travelled to the compound, and returned fire, but Trump said it was thought to have been \u201clocal gunfire\u201d. \u201cThey were terminated immediately,\u201d he said. Trump said that Russia had known that US forces would be coming into northwest Syria but that they hadn\u2019t been told why.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Trump said he knew of possible successors to Baghdadi as leader of Isis.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Asked about the decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, Trump said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We don\u2019t want to keep soldiers between Syria and Turkey for the next 200 years.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for this live blog for now. Just to recap, Donald Trump has announced that the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been killed in a raid by US special forces on his Syrian safehouse, ending a years-long manhunt for one of the world\u2019s most wanted terrorists. Trump said the two-hour operation was conducted on Saturday night in the province of Idlib, one of the last areas of the country still outside Syrian regime control, and that US officials had confirmed Baghdadi, 48, was among those killed. The president said the Isis leader died \u201crunning into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way\u201d. You can see our full report on today\u2019s events here: Here\u2019s a reminder of who Baghdadi was and why his death is so important: And here\u2019s an analysis of what Baghdadi\u2019s death means in a changing middle east: Thanks very much for reading. Speaking to NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, US national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien said the operation to kill the Isis leader had been named after Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian worker who was imprisoned by the group, tortured and repeatedly sexually abused by Baghdadi himself. She died in the terrorist group\u2019s confinement at the age of 26. We finally brought justice to a man that beheaded the three Americans, two journalists and a humanitarian worker. And Kayla Mueller who was working as a humanitarian, great young American, idealistic, young girl. And one of the things that General Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, did was named the operation that took down al-Baghdadi after Kayla Mueller, after what she had suffered. And that was something that people should know. But justice was brought to those Americans who were so brutally killed, as were others, as the president pointed out. He also stressed that Russia was \u201cnot an ally of the United States\u201d, despite the country having been thanked by Donald Trump in his statement to the media. Reports of his death had been frequent \u2013 and exaggerated, writes Martin Chulov. But not this time. Even as US forces were flying to Iraq the remains of the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was killed in Syria in the early hours of Saturday, a debate about his legacy was stirring. For more than five years, Baghdadi, who was known by birth as Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri, was the most wanted man on the planet \u2013 a figure who had turned an already potent post-invasion insurgency in Iraq into a formidable terrorist juggernaut that changed the course of history. In the time he led the Isis terror group, Baghdadi succeeded in shredding the authority of Iraq and Syria and testing the borders of the entire Middle East \u2013 all the while eluding the world\u2019s most powerful intelligence agencies and militaries. Chulov writes that the Isis leader\u2019s death comes as a new order takes shape in the Middle East. Read the whole piece here: Iran\u2019s information minister has tweeted that the death of Baghdadi is \u201cnot a big deal\u201d. Quoting Donald Trump\u2019s tweet, Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi said: \u201cNot a big deal. You just killed your creature.\u201d Here\u2019s an edit of the key parts of that Trump press conference: Diane Foley, whose son James was among those whose deaths were filmed for gruesome murder videos that became a trademark of Isis, has issued a response to the news that Baghdadi is dead. I am grateful to our president and brave troops for finding Isis leader Al-Bagdadi. I hope this will hinder the resurgence of terror groups and pray that captured Isis fighters will be brought to trial and held accountable. And here\u2019s some reaction from France\u2019s minister for the armed forces, Florence Parly. She says: Baghdadi: Early retirement for a terrorist, but not for his organisation. We will continue the fight relentlessly against Daesh, with our partners, adapting ourselves to new regional circumstances. I congratulate our American allies for this operation. My thoughts today are for all the victims of the madness of Baghdadi and the criminals who have followed him. In statement to Reuters, Fahrettin Altun, a senior aide to president Tayyip Erdogan, said: Turkey was proud to help the United States, our NATO ally, bring a notorious terrorist to justice ... We remember today Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s civilian victims and our military heroes, who lost their lives to protect the world from Daesh (Islamic State) terrorists. Turkey, which has been a bulwark against terrorism, will continue to work closely with the United States and others to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It is time to join forces and defeat all terrorist groups operating in the region without further delay. Here is a response from the UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab. The Russian state-run RIA news agency is quoting the country\u2019s ministry of defence saying it was not aware that they had provided any assistance to the US in the operation that targeted Baghdadi. \u201cWe are unaware of any alleged assistance to the flying of US aviation into the airspace of the Idlib de-escalation zone during this operation,\u201d major-general Igor Konashenkov is quoted as saying. In his press conference an hour ago, Trump thanked Russia for their support. Trump has just given a press conference, speaking to reporters for nearly an hour. The US president confirmed reports that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been killed in a US raid. Here is what we learned: Trump watched from the White House situation room as US special operations forces carried out a nighttime raid on a compound in north western Syria yesterday. He said the operation started at around 5pm US time and it was \u201clike watching a movie\u201d. No US personnel were killed, but \u201ca large number of Baghdadi\u2019s fighters and companions were killed with him\u201d. Trump said they would announce the exact number of deaths in due course. Baghdadi died after running into a dead-end tunnel with three of his children, \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way\u201d, said Trump. He detonated a suicide vest, bringing the tunnel down around him and killing himself and the three children. A DNA test was done immediately, confirming his identity. \u201cIt was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread,\u201d said Trump. Trump said they had had Baghdadi under surveillance for a couple of weeks. The US landed with eight helicopters at the compound and blew holes in the side of the building, avoiding the main door because they knew it was boobytrapped. Trump said that two of Baghdadi\u2019s wives were killed. They were wearing suicide vests, which were never detonated. The US president said 11 children were removed from the compound alive and some people surrendered. He would not say how many survivors there were, but he said there were \u201cmore dead than alive\u201d. US forces were in the compound for two hours and seized \u201chighly sensitive material and information\u201d on Isis, said Trump. The president thanked the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq and the Syrian Kurds for their cooperation. He said that one of the most dangerous aspects of the mission was the flight in and the flight out. The US helicopters were shot at as they travelled to the compound, and returned fire, but Trump said it was thought to have been \u201clocal gunfire\u201d. \u201cThey were terminated immediately,\u201d he said. Trump said that Russia had known that US forces would be coming into northwest Syria but that they hadn\u2019t been told why. Trump said he knew of possible successors to Baghdadi as leader of Isis. Asked about the decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, Trump said: We don\u2019t want to keep soldiers between Syria and Turkey for the next 200 years. They\u2019ve been fighting for hundreds of years. We\u2019re out. But we are leaving soldiers to secure the oil. And we might have to fight for the oil. It\u2019s ok. Maybe somebody else wants the oil, in which case they have a hell of a fight. [...] What I intend to do perhaps is make a deal with ExxonMobil or one of our great companies to go in there and do it properly. He said that European nations had been \u201ca tremendous disappointment\u201d because they hadn\u2019t taken responsibility for their own Isis fighters. Trump said he would call the families of James Foley and Kayla Mueller, both of whom died after being held in Isis captivity. The British prime minister has responded to the news that Baghdadi has been killed. He described it as \u201can important moment in our fight against terror\u201d, but warned that \u201cthe battle against the evil of Daesh is not yet over\u201d. The White House has released these images of the president watching the operation against Baghdadi: Trump says Baghdadi led his three children to death, detonating his suicide vest, which brought the tunnel they were in down around them. He says that he will call the families of James Foley and Kayla Mueller today. \u201cHe was an animal and he was a gutless animal,\u201d says Trump. \u201cThank you very much. It\u2019s a great day for our country\u201d. And that\u2019s it. I\u2019ll post a summary shortly. Trump says that before 9/11 he wrote a book in which he warned against the dangers of Osama bin Laden. \u201cI didn\u2019t get any credit. I never do,\u201d he says. I said you have to kill him, you have to take him out and nobody ever listened to me ... Let\u2019s put it this way, if they had listened to me a lot of things would have been different. Asked about the US withdrawal from Syria, Trump says: \u201cI don\u2019t want to guard Turkey and Syria for the rest of our lives\u201d. He adds: \u201cI will secure the oil that happens to be in a certain part, but there\u2019s tremendous money involved.\u201d Trump says that Iraq discriminates against the US \u201cdespite all we\u2019ve done\u201d when it comes to oil leases. Trump returns to paying tribute to the US dog that was injured in the operation. \u201cThe canine, a beautiful dog, a talented dog, was injured and brought back,\u201d he says. He says he and his team were gathered in the situation room at 5pm yesterday. The lift-off started moments later. He says that there were shots fired at the US helicopters as they were travelling towards the site and that the helicopters shot back. They conducted an on-site DNA test and brought body parts back with them. He says that positive identification of Baghdadi was made about 15 minutes later. Trump said that the European nations had been a tremendous disappointment for not taking back captured Isis fighters. \u201cMy people called a lot and said take your Isis fighters ...,\u201d he says. He singles out France, Germany and the UK. Trump says the US tax payer isn\u2019t going to pay to look after other countries\u2019 Isis fighters. The decision to pull US troops out of Syria was not linked to this operation, says Trump. The president sent his tweet last night (saying \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d) once he knew the mission had been successful and that the US personnel involved had landed safely, he says. Trump says he wanted to let journalists know that there would be a big announcement today, so they weren\u2019t \u201cout playing golf, or playing tennis, or otherwise indisposed\u201d. He says that Baghdadi\u2019s followers should be told how he died. \u201cHe didn\u2019t die a hero, he died a coward,\u201d says Trump. \u201cCrying, whimpering and screaming and bringing three kids with him.\u201d The operation started two weeks ago, says the president. He says that many of Baghdadi\u2019s team were killed and that the exact number would be confirmed in the coming days. Trump says the US lost no personnel in the operation, despite being greeted with \u201cfire power like you wouldn\u2019t believe\u201d. He adds that a US dog was injured. Trump says the US had been following Baghdadi for some weeks. He says that it was dangerous for the US to fly over other people\u2019s territory, but they had cooperation from other countries. \u201cWe flew very, very low and very fast.\u201d \u201cRussia treated us great... Iraq was excellent. We really had great cooperation,\u201d he says. Trump says Turkey knew they were \u201cgoing in\u201d. \u201cWe met with gun fire coming in, but that was local gun fire,\u201d he says. Baghdadi was \u201ca sick and depraved man,\u201d says Trump, \u201cand now he\u2019s gone\u201d. He was \u201cvicious and violent and he died in a vicious and violent way\u201d. Trump thanks Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq and the Syrian Kurds for \u201ccertain support they were able to give us\u201d. He thanks \u201cthe great intelligence professionals\u201d and the armed forces. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place. God bless America. Trump says that under his direction the US has \u201cobliterated his caliphate\u201d 100%. He describes Baghdadi and his supporters as losers. They had no idea what they were getting into \u2013 in some cases they were very frightened puppies and in other cases they were hardcore killers. Trump says that Baghdadi died \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming\u201d after running into a dead end tunnel. He says 11 young children were moved out of the house and are uninjured, but that Baghdadi brought three of his young children with him as he tried to escape down the tunnel. He then ignited a suicide vest, also killing his three children. Test results gave \u201ccertain and immediate identification\u201d, says Trump. \u201cIt was him.\u201d President Donald Trump has just started speaking. He says last night the US brought the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest terrorist leader to justice\u201d. \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead,\u201d he says. President Trump is about to give a press conference at the White House. You can follow it live above or on YouTube here. Here is a useful explainer from the Guardian\u2019s international correspondent, Michael Safi. Over the years there have have been multiple reports of Baghdadi\u2019s death. In June 2016, news outlets reported that the Isis leader was dead after a digitally altered image, claiming to be a statement from the terrorist group, was released. In June 2017, a senior Russian politician was reported to have said that the likelihood that the Isis leader had been killed was close to 100%. A month later a top Kurdish counter-terrorism official said he was 99% sure Baghdadi was alive. In the al-Hol camp for Isis detainees and their families in northern Syria, there are mixed reactions to the reports of Baghdadi\u2019s death. One side, which despises the organisation, is celebrating. The so-called \u2018irreconcilable\u2019 section is solemn and silent. One of the female detainees there said: \u201cWe don\u2019t respond to news from infidels\u201d. Two officials have told the Guardian\u2019s Martin Chulov that the raid followed a month-long intelligence operation that had tracked Baghdadi to the region through a smuggler who moved the wives of two of his brothers from Iraq to Idlib. An Iraqi intelligence official said the wives of Baghdadi\u2019s two brothers, Jumah and Ahmad, along with other family members, were monitored as they moved to the region. The information was passed to the CIA earlier this month, the officials said. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have issued statements welcoming \u201ca successful and historical\u201d joint intelligence operation with the US. The Guardian has not independently verified their claims of involvement. From the SDF\u2019s general commander: From the head of the SDF\u2019s press office: The Guardian has heard from first responders who were called by the neighbours after the attack. They say US troops gave the neighbours 10 children who were taken from the house that was raided. The house was being used by an Abu Mohammed al-Halabi. A senior Turkish official has told AFP that Baghdadi only arrived at his location 48 hours before the raid. To the best of my knowledge, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi arrived at this location 48 hours prior to the raid. We have been in close coordination with the relevant parties. The Turkish military did have advance knowledge of last night\u2019s raid. I can neither confirm nor deny that any intelligence was shared to facilitate last night\u2019s operation. This is from Turkey\u2019s ministry of national defence. They say that they exchanged information with the US ahead of the operation, which is thought to have targeted Baghdadi. On 10 January this year, Baghdadi survived a coup attempt launched by foreign fighters in his eastern Syrian hideout. The incident took place in a village near Hajin in the Euphrates River valley, where the jihadist group was clinging to its last sliver of land. Regional intelligence officials told our middle east correspondent Martin Chulov that a planned move against Baghdadi led to a firefight between foreign fighters and the fugitive terrorist chief\u2019s bodyguards, who then fled with him to the nearby deserts. Here\u2019s his full report: Baghdadi \u2013 who has led Isis since 2010, when it was still an underground al-Qaida offshoot in Iraq \u2013 has been the subject of an international manhunt for years and has a $25m bounty on his head. He was long thought to be hiding somewhere along the Iraq-Syria border. On 16 September, Isis\u2019s media network issued a 30-minute audio message purporting to come from Baghdadi, in which he said operations were taking place daily and called on supporters to free women jailed in camps in Iraq and Syria over their alleged links to his group. In April he appeared in a video for the first time in five years, weeks after the remnants of the terrorist group were ousted from their last organised stronghold in the eastern Syrian desert. Baghdadi blamed the demise of Isis on the \u201csavagery\u201d of Christians. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State terror group, is believed to have died in a US raid in north-western Syria overnight, intelligence officials have claimed. His death is unconfirmed. Guardian correspondents Martin Chulov and Michael Safi report that the raid followed a month-long intelligence operation that had tracked Baghdadi to the region through a smuggler who had moved the wives of two of his brothers from Iraq to Idlib. Donald Trump is due to make what has been described as a \u201cmajor statement\u201d in Washington at 9am on Sunday morning (1300 GMT). The president tweeted on Saturday night: You can read our full report here: Intelligence officials told the Guardian that Baghdadi may have detonated a suicide belt as troops approached a house near the Turkish border in which he was hiding. The blast is thought to have also killed two of his wives. Explosions and gunfire were reported from the small town of Barisha at about 1.30am local time on Sunday. It is understood that the Isis leader had been tracked to the home of one of his bodyguards who attempted to defend him. The raid is thought to have left at least nine people dead. Iraqi state television aired footage on Sunday that it said showed the raid. I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and I\u2019ll be live blogging as we find out more.

To many, Baghdadi was the sum of all fears, a man who had been transported straight from the savage early wars of Islamic history to the modern battlefields of the region nearly 1,500 years later.</p> <p>As he delivered his sermon that day, Baghdadi deliberately invoked past caliphates, in particular the Abbasid era (AD750-1517), which is often referred to as the Islamic Golden Age. Baghdadi believed that he could trace his lineage back to the prophet Muhammad, and that his postgraduate Islamic studies had earned him a place among Islam\u2019s historical figures.</p> <p>He also believed that his deeds in Iraq and Syria, and the violent cause he was leading, had outperformed the contemporary jihadist leaders who had come before him, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/02/osama-bin-laden-obituary\" title=\"\">Osama bin Laden</a>, and Baghdadi\u2019s immediate predecessors in Iraq, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/09/guardianobituaries.alqaida\" title=\"\">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>.</p> <p>Possessed of a sense of destiny that bordered on narcissism, Baghdadi was convinced he could topple the new regime in Baghdad, restore old ways in which Islam was practised, settle a 1,500-year-old score with the rival Islamic sect, the Shias, and help fulfil prophecies that edged the world towards an inevitable end of days showdown with a pre-ordained foe.</p> <p>Before he proclaimed himself Caliph Ibrahim, leader of the Islamic State across a swathe of land the size of Jordan, that straddled the Iraqi and Syrian borders, Baghdadi had spent the best part of a decade of his life preparing for such a day.</p> <p>He was one of six children born in the Iraqi city of Samarra, to a father from the al-Samarrai family, pious Sunnis, and his wife, Aliaa Hussain Ali.

      "bodyText": "The Netherlands\u2019 record goalscorer Vivianne Miedema said her first Women\u2019s Super League goal against Manchester City was a reward for the manager, Joe Montemurro, trusting her after a week of limited training. Miedema picked up a minor calf strain against Charlton last week but struck on the stroke of half-time to end the Blues\u2019 unbeaten league run and keep Arsenal\u2019s hopes of retaining the title well and truly alive. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling this week,\u201d Miedema said. \u201cI haven\u2019t really trained so I had to have a bit of extra energy. It was just smart for me to not train this week and I love that Joe trusts me and still played me and I think I paid him back today.\u201d Montemurro said: \u201cViv\u2019s a player for the 94 minutes on a Sunday and if we need to do certain things in the week to get her ready for Sunday then we will.\u201d Though City were top of the league with four wins from four, it could be argued there was no better time for the champions to face them. The defender Aoife Mannion ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid this month, Keira Walsh was suspended, and Ellen White\u2019s slow return from injury had meant she could only be on the bench. \u201cShe\u2019s a massive loss,\u201d said Jill Scott of Walsh. \u201cI do think she is one player in this team that is irreplaceable. We all bring different strengths as a midfield but I don\u2019t think anybody can do what Keira does.\u201d Arsenal dominated possession and passed the ball crisply, but City\u2019s strategy of cutting off the Gunners\u2019 attack at its roots, forcing them to play out from the back through former City defender Jen Beattie by sitting Janine Beckie on Leah Williamson, was very smart. With Williamson unable to pick out the between-the-lines passes at which she is normally so adept, Arsenal struggled to find a way through the two banks of four to which City frequently reverted. Scott, playing deeper in the absence of Walsh, did well to keep Arsenal\u2019s creative central pairing of Jordan Nobbs and Kim Little quiet. But with a minute left of the half, a fortunate deflection from Katie McCabe\u2019s cross fell at the feet of Little who slipped Miedema through one on one and, with the centre back Gemma Bonner woefully out of position, the Gunners\u2019 forward fired low past Ellie Roebuck to put Arsenal ahead. On 66 minutes Nick Cushing, the City manager, replaced Beckie with White to make her first appearance in a Manchester City shirt \u2013 and first since her World Cup heroics. But Arsenal continued to dominate, pressing high and testing the composure of Roebuck at every opportunity, looking more likely to get a second than concede. Cushing was left ruing a lack of chances. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a shot against Man United and we didn\u2019t have a shot against Arsenal today. \u201cHaving Ellen back will give us hopefully more firepower but we\u2019ve got to get on the training pitch as a group and improve.\u201d Chelsea go top of WSL Chelsea came from a goal down after Adriana Leon struck for West Ham to leapfrog Manchester City at the top of the table. Goals from Sophie Ingle and Ji So-yun within two minutes of each other and an injury-time effort from Drew Spence ensured Emma Hayes\u2019s side took full advantage of Manchester City\u2019s dropped points. Kirsty Hanson and Jess Sigsworth scored either side of the break as Manchester United saw off Reading to keep them within three points of City and Arsenal. Everton earned their third win of their league campaign (matching last year\u2019s tally), Chloe Kelly scored for the fourth time in five league games before City loanee Esme Morgan headed in a second. Tottenham stayed level on points with United and Everton after two goals in two minutes from Kit Graham overturned Abi Harrison\u2019s first-half goal for Bristol City. Birmingham earned their first points of the season with a 2-0 defeat of Liverpool. An early goal from Kerys Harrop was added to by England midfielder Lucy Staniforth late on to leave Liverpool rooted to the bottom of the table with a single point.",

Forest Bihan, carrying 20lb less than Frodon, eventually won with a degree of comfort while his more famous rival laboured home 14 lengths behind. \u201cTaking the last three fences out helped us more than them,\u201d admitted the winning trainer, Brian Ellison. \u201cI keep saying to the owner, this would be a 100-rated horse if we ran him on the Flat. He\u2019s very classy.\u201d The officials\u2019 decision received the backing of Brian Hughes, rider of Forest Bihan, who said low sun was also an issue during last year\u2019s Old Roan, when all the fences were jumped. He said his mount that day, Cloudy Dream, hit a fence and suffered an injury that has sidelined him since. \u201cIt\u2019s all about welfare, at the end of the day,\u201d Hughes added. Andrew Tulloch, Aintree\u2019s long-serving clerk of the course, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a decision we like to take but Sean Quinlan, who\u2019s the safety officer, said he wasn\u2019t confident [that the fences were safe to jump in the circumstances]. Safety is paramount.\u201d Low sun had not been a factor for a steeplechase an hour earlier and all the fences were jumped in the race after the Old Roan, leading to social media suggestions that Aintree should consider running their big race earlier or later on the card. But Tulloch said cloud cover had helped when those other races were being run and it was not possible to anticipate when the sun would be problematic. Paul Nicholls, trainer of Frodon, had said on Saturday that his horse faced a stiff task at the weights. He must hope Frodon will be sharper for his next outing, expected to be in the Betfair Chase at Haydock, for which he is now an 8-1 shot behind the 2-1 favourite, Bristol De Mai.",

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s us \u2013 enjoy the rest of your weekend. Ta-ra. And here\u2019s Louise Taylor\u2019s match report. How Wolves go about improving is tricky because they have such a settled side; where do they find better players, if they already have, more or less, players as good as they can afford and attract? We\u2019re nearly done here, so you should beetle over to Liverpool-Chelsea with Rob Smyth, here. Newcastle should have enough to stay up because they\u2019ll shade enough home games, but they need to find a way of supporting Joelinton, whether it\u2019s getting full-backs into the box, having the wide attackers play narrower or asking for third man runs from midfield. Wolves, meanwhile, need to start games better, and should have a proper go for the Europa League. Newcastle took the lead after finding a few minutes of first-half pressure, but Wolves were much the better side in the second and well worth their equaliser. Wolves move up 11th, while Newcastle stay 17th, the only team in the league who\u2019ve not scored more than once in any game this season. 90+6 min VAR is checking for a potential pull on Doherty inside the box. There is one, I\u2019d say, but not enough to persuade the ref - or, more importantly, me - that anything needs to be done about it. 90+5 min Moutinho lofts another ball into the box and Saiss flicks on; Traore catches up with it on the line, but when he goes to do whatever he\u2019s going to do next, he can\u2019t sort his feet out so trips over them instead. 90+3 min Vinagre breaks through centrefield and Gayle yanks him by the arm but can\u2019t abort his run \u2013 he\u2019ll be booked when the ball goes dead, I\u2019d expect. But Wolves keep it moving and Jimenez prompts outside the box, finds Neves, then hares into it to catch up with a pass over the top, somehow sliding into a cross that Doherty heads just wide. 90+2 min Alan Smith gives Traore his man of the match award, and that seems fair enough to me. He\u2019s been the most consistently threatening attacker and was instrumental in his team\u2019s equaliser. 91 min There\u2019ll be five additional minutes, and with those changes we can only assume Bruace wants Newcastle to use them seeking a win. 90 min Two more changes for Newcastle, Longstaff M \u2013 who\u2019s been quiet \u2013 and Saint-Maximin replaced by Atsu and Gayle. 89 min Since they came up, no side has scored more injury-time goals than Wolves, and they\u2019re doing their best to find another. Neto finds Vinagre, who diddles Yedlin and stands up a cross, but can\u2019t pick out a man. 88 min ...which Willems heads away. 87 min Wolves are pushing for the win, Neto taking the ball 25 yards out and lashing a shot which is deflected behind. Moutinho, who\u2019s been quiet, will take the corner... 85 min Immediately, Vinagre gets the ball down the left and hangs up a cross for Doherty at the far post. He heads down, into Lascelles and behind. 84 min Change apiece, Vinagre replacing Jonny then Jon Joeshelvey replacing Joelinton. That is harsh. He slides in, shins the ball away from Neves, and ploughs through Neves in the follow-through. He got enough on the ball to avoid punishment, I\u2019d say \u2013 it wasn\u2019t in Neves\u2019 possession butn there to be won - but I can see why the ref thought differently. 80 min Nice from Newcastle, Yedlin dashing down the right and winning a corner off Jonny when his cross is deflected behind, but the ref determines to the contrary. Steve Bruce finds the whole thing hilarious, slapping his thigh and kissing the fourth official. 78 min Newcastle have been a little better the last few minutes, but the more they look for a winner the more they\u2019re likely to get nobbled on the break. 76 min Willems finds all sorts of space outside the box so lines up a shot that flies through Dendoncker\u2019s legs and only just wide. 74 min Saint-Maximin nips outside Neves, who pulls him back and is booked. 73 min \u201cI dunno why a team playing Thursday-Sunday should be more tired than a team playing Weds-Saturday,\u201d tweets Chris Eastside. \u201cIt\u2019s the same number of days.\u201d It is, but if the body is used to a certain thing, then it is, and if the brain is then it certainly is. I also guess the travelling and lack of home comfort makes is draining. That was coming. Neto does really well, playing into Traore, who cleverly snaps a reverse-ball back into his path. The cross is duly dinked into the middle, Dubravka flaps for no reason, and Jonny is on-hand to drive home from close range. Newcastle need to change something here, else they\u2019ll concede again. 71 min \u201cI smashed my front teeth when giving a drunken piggy-back to a lord\u2019s daughter,\u201d says Stuart Fore Proudlock. \u201cAt least the drink numbed the pain.\u201d 70 min Change for Wolves, Neto replacing Jota. He\u2019s had a decent second half, so I guess Nuno has decided it\u2019s not his day and to rest him for the next game. 69 min Almiron nips away from Saiss, who chops him down. Booking. 69 min Wolves\u2019 wide players are doing pretty well this half. Perhaps they might take a risk and sling on another striker to give them another target. 67 min \u201cI fell down a cave 28 years ago yesterday,\u201d tweets @FredLeopard. \u201cI was unlucky enough to hit my chin on a rock to snap both top front, chip all four bottom incisors and rip my lip to shreds.\u201d *Makes diving motion* 66 min Jimenez is too quick for Lascelles who, already committed to the challenge, introduces studs to metatarsus. He\u2019s booked. 64 min Wolves are into this now! Jota takes a pass off Jonny and squeezes inside Clark, the ball clipping his heels and taking it away from Longstaff S. Jota then hovers into the box and with options to his right, opts to swivel into a shot back the other way, Dubravka fumbling then collecting. 63 min It\u2019s a fair while since Newcastle mustered an attack of note. 61 min Traore looks most likely to make the difference and again he gets to the line, roasting Willems in the process and moving along it before crossing low into Dubravka\u2019s ankle. 61 min Ok, go on: what\u2019s the most stupid way you\u2019ve injured teeth, or yourself? I smashed a perfect arch into my front pair when bending down behind someone to trip them up and the shover shoved before I was ready. 60 min We\u2019ve all been there. 58 min Wolves are coming! Jonny comes off the line and finds Jimenez dropping off, who clips a lovely pass into the box to meet the run of Doherty, coming from the opposite side. He can\u2019t make an angle for a shot, though, so digs one out that goes straight to Dubrakva. 57 min Better from Wolves, Dendoncker finding Traore, who clips towards Jota at the near post - his decision-making and execution has improved so much - but his man almost ducks under the ball, heading high from a very decent position. 55 min Traore glides inside, and before Longstaff M can upend him, Clark scythes through him. He\u2019s booked, and Longstaff S again evades a booking though he booted the ball away. 55 min Saint-Maximin bounces away from Neves, who can\u2019t even grab a handful of shirt, then goes at Dendoncker on the outside before running out of pitch. 52 min Jimenez bousts down the left so Longstaff S shoves him hard in the back and away he sprawls. The ref has a quiet one, but keeps his cards to himself. 50 min Saint-Maximin skates away from Jota out on the right touchline, veers into the box, and attacks Saiss on the outside; he slides in expertly to send the ball behind. There\u2019s a quick check for a penalty, but that was a proper tackle. 49 min But here they come again, Willems misplacing a pass that allows Traore to barrel to the line. A little nudge does enough to put him off, his cross deflected behind, and the eventuating corner comes to nowt. 48 min But here\u2019s Traore down the right, winning a throw deep inside the Newcastle half that they can\u2019t parlay into anything more. so the passing continues until Neves sells Jimenez short. 46 min I wonder if that first half performance is an unfortunate by-product of Wolves\u2019 style: they tend to play pretty slowly, probing for openings, so when they\u2019re a bit tired or not at it, the lost crispness doesn\u2019t leave them with much because theirs is not a high-energy style able to compensate. That or they just played rubbish, definitely one of the two. 46 min Off we go again. The players are back with us, no bruises visible on any of the Wolves players are far as I can see. Half-time entertainment: Three minutes of mild pressure were enough to deliver the opening goal of a dull first half. Newcastle have looked the more incisive, but Wolves produced an excellent second-half comeback in midweek, so will know they are capable of improvement. See you in 10 or so. 45+2 min Wolves win a free-kick down the left which Moutinho dinks in. Jota does really well to control on the half-volley and half-turn, spinning to shoot low, straight at Dubravka. 45 min There\u2019ll be two added minutes, which is odd because I\u2019m sure Jota was down for three. I\u2019d much prefer the authorities had sorted the time-keeping \u2013 the ball is in play too little and time-wasting is too annoying \u2013 that foisted VAR upon us. 44 min 43 min By the looks of things, half the ground have gone for a bevvy. Meanwhile, Saint-Maximin crosses from the left and the ball reaches Almiron. Longstaff S tells him exactly where he wants it, but the pace is all wrong so by the time he shoots there after defenders right up in his business. 41 min \u201cI went to school with a kid named Joe Linton,\u201d emails Mac Millings. \u201cCan anybody beat that? Yeah, me, because I also went out with a girl called Fern Andinho.\u201d Obviously Steve Bruce calls him \u201cBig Joe\u201d \u2013 Joelinton that it, not Fernandinho. My favourite contraction of that ilk is Sam Allardyce calling Tal Ben Haim \u201cBen\u201d, \u201cBen\u201d meaning \u201cSon of\u201d in Hebrew. 39 min It\u2019s too much to say that was coming, but a few minutes of pressure are what brought it about. Jota has the ball close to his own by-line but gets wide looking to pass when he just needs to clear. So Longstaff picks up the pieces and crosses to the back post where, up with Joelinton, Saiss does brilliantly to head away. But Fernandez turns up on the right wing to sling over a luscious cross, which Lascelles butts home from close range. 35 min Little flurry from Newcastle earns a corner, which Longstaff S boots straight to the man on the near post. He gets another go though, so goes short, and Newcastle keep Wolves pinned... 34 min Lovely from Longstaff M, who controls a loose ball then controls a lope over the top for Almiron! He screeches after it, but his second touch is heavy, allowing Rui Patricio to narrow the angle and force the prod into the side-netting. He can\u2019t dream a goal. 33 min Newcastle win a free-kick down the left, which Longstaff curls towards the far post, but it doesn\u2019t have the pace Joelinton needs to attack it. 32 min \u201cBit like the batteries controlling them are running flat at the moment!\u201d says Louise Taylor, at SJP for your super, soaraway Guardian. \u201cAtmosphere here v low key...\u201d 30 min Wolves win a corner down the right ... which Fernandez heads clear. Wolves have another shy at crossing, and when this one goes away they tear forward in numbers! Almiron streaks away, assesses his options, then picks none of them. Of course he does, or doesn\u2019t. 29 min I wonder if Newcastle might move Longstaff S further forward. Currently, Longstaff M is having more of the ball, but it\u2019s when his older brother gets on it that we wonder if something might possibly perhaps maybe happen. 28 min My days what a riff that is \u2013 any more for any more? Pulp have lasted by far the best of the Britpop bands. 27 min This game is taking place in slowmotion. 25 min Obviously I could take him if I had to, but does Adama Traore have the biggest biceps in the Premeer League? And do they not make a shirt to fit them, or is the tightness an aesthetic and aerodynamic preference? 23 min Jimenez turns up on the right and Longstaff M challenges, then feeds his brother a nasty little short pass at pace ... but one deft touch allows him to sling a long ball down the right for Yedlin. He then finds Almiron, who crosses for Joelinton, but Coady does well to intercept, heading away from danger. Champagne football, by the standard. 21 min Jota nashes down the left, Lascelles in pursuit, and he nips in front well before jockeying to see the ball out. He falls, but the ref gives him a free-kick. 19 min Jota comes right back on and Saint-Maximin robs him immediately, dashing towards the box and leathering a low shot directly into Saiss\u2019 shins. 17 min Jota is down after taking a bang on the bonce when Fernandez zoned right through him. It was a right sair yin, shoulder, chest and entire corporeality introducing him directly to the grass \u2013 there\u2019s a long pause because I have briefly been possessed by the ghost of Harold Pinter at long last football is now doing the right thing. 15 min I had my first proper night out in Newcastle. It was 1993, I was 14, and wore a petrol-blue suit because when I\u2019d seen footballers going out in the various comics I read, that was how they dressed. I looked the absolute business, I can tell you. 13 min A nice chip from Doherty sends Traore off - he times his run well - and stands up a nasty-looking cross that Fernandez has to attack in the knowledge that Jimenez is clattering him while he\u2019s in the process. He copes with it well. 11 min This has been a flat start from Newcastle, and the crowd are quiet too - you can hear the shouts of the players on the telly. 10 min In comes the corner and Dubravka\u2019s clearing punch is poor, but eventually his team-mates see the ball away. 9 min Jimenez finds space dropping off, not for the first time - one of the brothers will need to watch that - and spreads left to Jonny, whose low cross is humped behind. 8 min Matty Longstaff looks like one of those kids who enjoys taking beats, and can do a minute of deodorant sprayed directly onto the arm, without flinching. 6 min It is too facile to call Sean Longstaff Michael Carrick with legs? Their upright style and sharp passing is extremely similar. 4 min Bit of possession from Newcastle, orchestrated by Sean Longstaff. He finds such clever angles, and a slipped reverse-pass to Almiron wins his team a free-kick, down the right. He clips it in himself and Joelinton nods back across, but Pooralmiron can\u2019t connect properly with his shot. 3 min I\u2019d never really noticed the majesty of Steve Bruce\u2019s hairline, but it\u2019s a very fine job. 2 min Nice from Wolves, the ball zipping between Jota, Moutinho and Traore, whose cross is partially cleared before Jota hooks \u2013 or hookes, in local dialect \u2013 a shot straight at Dubravka. 1 min Matty Longstaff sticks in a heed as Jota leaps with studs; of course he does. But it\u2019s Jota who comes away with the ball and Wolves knock it about nicely. 1 min Off we go! Newcastle might fancy themselves to get involved early, while Wolves run Thursday night out of their legs. They played really well in the second half of that one, but expended far more effort than they\u2019d have hoped. Apprentice music rings out \u2013 here come the teams! I wonder how the teams will go about this one as both like to sit back. Wolves might struggle to pick Newcastle apart, and might need to send more men forward than usual to cause problems. Newcastle, I think, will sit back but look to attack in numbers when the opportunity presents itself. Steve Bruce reckons good results are helpful and that Wolves are good. He says his team have had a difficult start, but it\u2019s games like today\u2019s that can define the season. Nuno, meanwhile, says being without Boly is a \u201cbig blow\u201d and he\u2019s waiting for the assessment and hoping for the best. He thinks Newcastle are a good team, and his players need to be focused and stick with their plans. I feel extremely revelated. \u201cIn addition to listing the head referee these days,\u201d emails JR in Illinois, \u201cyou should probably also list the VAR referee. As we\u2019ve seen already this weekend the use of VAR is still extremely VARiable. The VAR ref is capable of all sorts and could eff up a game as easily as not. Anyway, today\u2019s man behind the screen is Graham Scott. On a separate note, do you ever worry about Jimenez? I do. I think he\u2019s a great player but I\u2019m worried Nuno is going to break him. It seems like Jimenez plays every single game, and with Europa League participation that seems pretty brutal. Has he even had any rest this season?\u201d I have so little patience for VAR, which fails to solve a problem which doesn\u2019t exist. Who fell in love with the game on account of its correct decision-making process? Which self-respecting \u2013 ok, non-self-respecting \u2013 adult experiences anger about a football match more than 15 minutes after it\u2019s finished? As for Jimenez, I guess once Cutrone finds his feet, assuming he finds his feet, Nuno will feel able to take him out. In other black and white news, I enjoyed this. Question: is there a difference in pronunciation between \u201choway\u201d and \u201chaway\u201d, or just in stripe-colour? I cannot enjoy enough of these. Things to which I\u2019m looking forward (2): Adama Traore. We can\u2019t know quite how Nuno has transformed him. It might be lots of detailed direction, with charts, diagrams, videos and such; it might be a pointed comment here and a kind word there; it might be the player reaching maturity; or it might be a combination of all three. Whatever the answer, he is now a serious threat in every game, and is only going to get better. Well done him. Things to which I\u2019m looking forward (1): the brothers Longstaff. Neves and Moutinho are as clever a pair as any, and playing them must be extremely frustrating. Running power is definitely an advantage when it comes to negating them, but nous and chill are necessary too. I wonder if we\u2019ll see Sean try and take them out of the game by hitting long passes into the channels for Joelinton, Almiron and Saint-Maximin. Newcastle make one change from their last game \u2013 and the one before that: Fabian Schar is injured, so Federioc Fernandez comes in. Andy Carroll is also injured, ctrl C, ctrl V. As for Wolves, Willy Boly hurt himself in training \u2013 badly, say the rumours \u2013 so his place in that famous back three goes to Matt Doherty. As such, Leander Dendoncker comes into midfield, with Jota for Cutrone the other change from their last league game. Newcastle United (a deliberately stodgy, affirmingly Spangeordie 3-4-3): Dubravka; Fernandez, Lascelles, Clark; Yedlin, Longstaff M, Longstaff S, Willems; Almiron, Joelinton, Saint-Maximin. Subs: Darlow, Krafth, Dummett, Shelvey, Atsu, Gayle, Muto. Wolverhampton Wanderers (an ideologue\u2019s 3-5-2): Rui Patricio; Doherty, Coady, Saiss; Traore, Dendoncker, Moutinho, Neves, Jonny; Jimenez, Jota. Subs: Vallejo, Pedro Neto, Cutrone, Ruddy, Ruben Vinagre, Kilman, Ashley-Seal. Var\u2019s straight man: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire) In his epochal treatise on modern football, On Liberty, John Stuart Mill popularised the phrase \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d. Roughly, his point was that most people are wrong about most things most of the time \u2013 though of course he made an exception for Mike Ashely \u2013 before going on to predict that Steve Bruce would do some decent work in his management career and that a few bad results at the start of a season would not mean that Wolves had \u201cbeen found out\u201d. Of course, at Newcastle, all Bruce had to do was copy Rafael Benitez \u2013 it just took him a while to put his ego away, as it would as us all, and now he has things have improved. Wolves meanwhile, have not \u201cbeen found out\u201d because there is no \u201cfinding out\u201d to be done. How they play should be obvious and why it works should be obvious; they were good last season because, as even Mill knew in 1859, football doesn\u2019t change: decent players, well managed, will make for a decent team. It\u2019s hard to see much in the way of speed or goals today, but such is utilitarianism, or something. Kick-off: 2pm GMT, baby.",

The group positioned itself as a champion of the disenfranchised \u2013 willing to reclaim lost glories and restore Islamic precepts.

Appearing unmasked for the first time, he declared himself to be the caliph: the political and religious leader of the global Muslim community.</p>\n    <p>His declaration was roundly rejected by almost all Islamic religious authorities but his caliphate became a magnet for thousands of foreign fighters and women. The group attempted not just to hold territory but to administer it like a state, establishing a brutal justice system, collecting taxes and doling out public services.</p>\n    <p>Baghdadi had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/29/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-appears-in-video-for-first-time-in-five-years\">been seen publicly</a>&nbsp;on one other occasion, in an 18-minute video released in April this year.

Baghdadi\u2019s ability to evade his pursuers had amplified that appeal, something which his violent death, cornered in a tunnel far from home, may help diminish.</p> \n<p>But the huge disruption and grievances the group caused remain raw and largely unresolved. The naked failings of authority in the region are in many ways just as troubling. Weak political governance offers few guarantees of justice or reconciliation. Perceived losses are unlikely to be recovered anytime soon.</p> \n<p>Instead, a new regional order is taking shape that underpins the tremendous chaos Isis has caused. New areas of influence are being demarcated and there is now a real chance that some of the region\u2019s post second world war borders could be redrawn along ethnic sectarian lines.</p> \n<p>In Syria\u2019s volatile east, large restive populations of Isis detainees remain interned where, for the past six months, they have been able to reorganise. The new Isis camps are bigger and more combustible than the US versions in southern Iraq, where Baghdadi earned his stripes as a future leader during a nine month stint in 2004. Back then, he was able to convince his captors that he was a stabilising influence, and they let him go. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was anything but. He lived and died as one of the savage and influential figures of modern times.</p>",

By mid last year a momentum that had seemed unstoppable had begun to slow. In Iraq, militia groups that had fought alongside the Iraqi army had clawed back all major cities. In Syria, Kurdish proxies of the US had recaptured Raqqa and nearly all the territory Isis had seized. The rest was retaken earlier this year in a painstaking push near where it all began for the forerunners of Isis, along the Euphrates River basin. From the town of Baghuz emerged tens of thousands of Isis fighters and followers, most bedraggled and beaten. Some defiant. The remnants of the group have since been in detention centres in eastern Syria, or Iraqi prisons \u2013 their fate uncertain, as is that of much of the land they controlled. While Donald Trump can credibly claim that Isis no longer controls any contiguous land, there have been clear signs over recent months that cells on both sides of the river are beginning to reassemble. Security in eastern Syria remains brittle, as does the region\u2019s body politic. The US decision to abandon the Kurds who fought on their behalf is unlikely to bring stability to a still volatile area, where the stark realities exposed by the Isis rampage remain just as troubling in defeat. The ground war was won by non-state actors who fought on Iraq and Syria\u2019s behalf. The national armies of both countries splintered in the face of the threat and are yet to fully regroup. Isis took hold in the vacuum of the 2003 US invasion, which had ousted the Sunni ruling class in Iraq and diminished the status the sect held in society. The group positioned itself as a champion of the disenfranchised \u2013 willing to reclaim lost glories and restore Islamic precepts. A sense of Sunni grievance was central to its message, and it readily tapped into the fortunes of Sunnis elsewhere; in Lebanon, whose patron Rafik Hariri was assassinated in 2005 and in Syria, where the anti-Assad opposition was primarily drawn from the same sect. Then and now, the narrative resonated with some who otherwise disavowed the hardline theology that Isis used as a driving force. Baghdadi\u2019s ability to evade his pursuers had amplified that appeal, something which his violent death, cornered in a tunnel far from home, may help diminish. But the huge disruption and grievances the group caused remain raw and largely unresolved. The naked failings of authority in the region are in many ways just as troubling. Weak political governance offers few guarantees of justice or reconciliation. Perceived losses are unlikely to be recovered anytime soon. Instead, a new regional order is taking shape that underpins the tremendous chaos Isis has caused. New areas of influence are being demarcated and there is now a real chance that some of the region\u2019s post second world war borders could be redrawn along ethnic sectarian lines. In Syria\u2019s volatile east, large restive populations of Isis detainees remain interned where, for the past six months, they have been able to reorganise. The new Isis camps are bigger and more combustible than the US versions in southern Iraq, where Baghdadi earned his stripes as a future leader during a nine month stint in 2004. Back then, he was able to convince his captors that he was a stabilising influence, and they let him go. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was anything but. He lived and died as one of the savage and influential figures of modern times.",

He had flown first to Ho Chi Minh City, then travelled to Malaysia, then Turkey, then Greece and finally to France.</p> <p>But Ha, it seems, never made it to the UK, his final destination. The 30-year-old is likely among the 39 people found dead in the back of a lorry in Essex in the early hours of Wednesday, many of whom had begun their journey 6,000 miles away in the impoverished farming communities of Vietnam.

The illegal journey did not come cheap but family and friends clubbed together, and Ha borrowed vast sums, to raise the 700m Vietnamese dong (\u00a323,500) needed to pay the people smugglers.</p> <p>The British and Vietnamese authorities have yet to confirm the identification of any of the bodies in the lorry, but Ha was among four people from the commune known to be boarding the lorry in France. The police have since visited Ha\u2019s parents twice to collect DNA samples.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am about to get in a car to England</p> <footer> <cite>Le Minh Tuan's last words from his son, Le Van Ha</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tuan said he did not know how Ha had been travelling, but every time his son reached a new country, he would call home. \u201cI do not know what Ha had planned to do when he reached England,\u201d said Tuan.</p> <p>Father Anton Dang Huu Nam, a local priest who has been assisting the victims\u2019 families, led a memorial service on Saturday night at his church. He said 35 out of the 39 who died were from Nghe An province: 25 were from his district of Yen Thanh, while two were from nearby Dieu Chau district and another two from the city of Vinh; another six victims were from Ha Tinh district.</p> <p>\u201cAmong the people who died in the truck \u2026 my sources indicate that most of them went through China, where they got fake passports,\u201d said Nam. \u201cFamilies often pay around 1bn vietnamese dong to get to the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Nam said he had been informed that some of the families of those who had died in the lorry had since received a refund from the traffickers.</p> <p>\u201cThe economic situation, environmental issues, the value of life, poor social security, education, culture, human rights abuses \u2013 all these issues make Vietnamese people not want to remain in Vietnam,\u201d said Nam. \u201cThey know it\u2019s dangerous but they feel they have to take a gamble for a better life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9082de6327a955519900ea6e2c560cc3d0e5990e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9082de6327a955519900ea6e2c560cc3d0e5990e/0_85_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Father Anton Dang Huu Nam led a memorial service to the victims at the weekend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Father Anton Dang Huu Nam led a memorial service to the victims at the weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lam Le</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nearby, in the house of Nguyen Dinh Tu, another of the suspected victims, the family had set up a memorial altar on a small table, covered with a shiny red table cloth and bearing his photo among offerings of fruit and flowers.</p> <p>Tu\u2019s mother, Nyuyen Dinh Sat, lay on a mat before the altar, sobbing. \u201cDo you love your parents, can you see me?\u201d Sat cried out, reaching desperately for the picture of her son. \u201cYou said you\u2019d go to bring money home to look after your father and mother.\u201d She collapsed into tears, with pleas of \u201cson, son\u201d. Next to her, Tu\u2019s sister and aunt also sat crying. Tu\u2019s wife, Hoang Thi Thong, remained in hospital with their five-year-old son who is ill with pneumonia.</p> <p>His family said Tu, who also had a one-year-old daughter, had travelled abroad in March to help his family, who had got 700m dong into debt building a house and paying medical bills for their sick children.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no jobs and no future here,\u201d said Tu\u2019s sister, Nguyen Thi Tan. The house, though newly built, had barely any furniture, with just a few wooden stools in the living room. Tu had chosen to travel to Romania first because the journey to the UK was notoriously more dangerous and more expensive. His family said Tu paid traffickers 300m Vietnamese dong to reach Romania.</p> <p>However, after spending some months in Romania making little money, Tu decided to make the journey to the UK, where his father in law was now living, paying people smugglers another 350m dong. The family has not had official confirmation that Tu was among the dead, but contacts in London have told the family that it is 90% certain given his dates of travel and when they lost contact with him.</p> <p>In the nearby commune of Dien Chau in Nghe An province, where many leave to make made the illegal journey to Europe, another family said they were in a state of suspended anxiety because they had just lost contact with their son who had recently travelled to the UK illegally. \u201cWe have a lingering hope that he just got detained which is why we have heard nothing from him,\u201d said a relative.</p> <p>In a cafe in Dien Chau, a local neighbour who asked to remain unnamed said: \u201cIt\u2019s very normal here for people to go abroad illegally for work, they go to make a living but have to accept the consequences.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cNo one has the option to go legally and so people have to make a choice: the riskier the path, the lower the cost. Those that go to England tend to be those that want to turn around their lives fast but have to borrow big sums of money. After this incident, fewer people will probably go to England but they\u2019ll just go elsewhere instead.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The last time that Le Minh Tuan spoke to his son Le Van Ha, it was in a brief phonecall. \u201cI have made it to France,\u201d Ha told his father on Monday, \u201cand I am about to get in a car to England.\u201d It had been a long journey for Ha since he left his small farming community of Yen Hoi, in Vietnam\u2019s Nghe An province, in July, in search of better prospects. He had flown first to Ho Chi Minh City, then travelled to Malaysia, then Turkey, then Greece and finally to France. But Ha, it seems, never made it to the UK, his final destination. The 30-year-old is likely among the 39 people found dead in the back of a lorry in Essex in the early hours of Wednesday, many of whom had begun their journey 6,000 miles away in the impoverished farming communities of Vietnam. The Vietnamese prime minister has ordered an investigation into human trafficking. In Ha\u2019s family home, where large wedding photos of him and his wife hang on the walls, Tuan, 57, spoke of his devastation at the loss of his son. \u201cHa just wanted to provide for his family,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a good man who never let anyone down.\u201d Ha, who had two sons \u2013 a three-month-old and a five-year-old \u2013 decided to travel to Europe after losing his job with the police and hearing of friends abroad who were prospering. The illegal journey did not come cheap but family and friends clubbed together, and Ha borrowed vast sums, to raise the 700m Vietnamese dong (\u00a323,500) needed to pay the people smugglers. The British and Vietnamese authorities have yet to confirm the identification of any of the bodies in the lorry, but Ha was among four people from the commune known to be boarding the lorry in France. The police have since visited Ha\u2019s parents twice to collect DNA samples. Tuan said he did not know how Ha had been travelling, but every time his son reached a new country, he would call home. \u201cI do not know what Ha had planned to do when he reached England,\u201d said Tuan. Father Anton Dang Huu Nam, a local priest who has been assisting the victims\u2019 families, led a memorial service on Saturday night at his church. He said 35 out of the 39 who died were from Nghe An province: 25 were from his district of Yen Thanh, while two were from nearby Dieu Chau district and another two from the city of Vinh; another six victims were from Ha Tinh district. \u201cAmong the people who died in the truck \u2026 my sources indicate that most of them went through China, where they got fake passports,\u201d said Nam. \u201cFamilies often pay around 1bn vietnamese dong to get to the UK.\u201d Nam said he had been informed that some of the families of those who had died in the lorry had since received a refund from the traffickers. \u201cThe economic situation, environmental issues, the value of life, poor social security, education, culture, human rights abuses \u2013 all these issues make Vietnamese people not want to remain in Vietnam,\u201d said Nam. \u201cThey know it\u2019s dangerous but they feel they have to take a gamble for a better life.\u201d Nearby, in the house of Nguyen Dinh Tu, another of the suspected victims, the family had set up a memorial altar on a small table, covered with a shiny red table cloth and bearing his photo among offerings of fruit and flowers. Tu\u2019s mother, Nyuyen Dinh Sat, lay on a mat before the altar, sobbing. \u201cDo you love your parents, can you see me?\u201d Sat cried out, reaching desperately for the picture of her son. \u201cYou said you\u2019d go to bring money home to look after your father and mother.\u201d She collapsed into tears, with pleas of \u201cson, son\u201d. Next to her, Tu\u2019s sister and aunt also sat crying. Tu\u2019s wife, Hoang Thi Thong, remained in hospital with their five-year-old son who is ill with pneumonia. His family said Tu, who also had a one-year-old daughter, had travelled abroad in March to help his family, who had got 700m dong into debt building a house and paying medical bills for their sick children. \u201cThere are no jobs and no future here,\u201d said Tu\u2019s sister, Nguyen Thi Tan. The house, though newly built, had barely any furniture, with just a few wooden stools in the living room. Tu had chosen to travel to Romania first because the journey to the UK was notoriously more dangerous and more expensive. His family said Tu paid traffickers 300m Vietnamese dong to reach Romania. However, after spending some months in Romania making little money, Tu decided to make the journey to the UK, where his father in law was now living, paying people smugglers another 350m dong. The family has not had official confirmation that Tu was among the dead, but contacts in London have told the family that it is 90% certain given his dates of travel and when they lost contact with him. In the nearby commune of Dien Chau in Nghe An province, where many leave to make made the illegal journey to Europe, another family said they were in a state of suspended anxiety because they had just lost contact with their son who had recently travelled to the UK illegally. \u201cWe have a lingering hope that he just got detained which is why we have heard nothing from him,\u201d said a relative. In a cafe in Dien Chau, a local neighbour who asked to remain unnamed said: \u201cIt\u2019s very normal here for people to go abroad illegally for work, they go to make a living but have to accept the consequences.\u201d He added: \u201cNo one has the option to go legally and so people have to make a choice: the riskier the path, the lower the cost. Those that go to England tend to be those that want to turn around their lives fast but have to borrow big sums of money. After this incident, fewer people will probably go to England but they\u2019ll just go elsewhere instead.\u201d",

Claire Campbell along with her daughter Esther said they are speaking out to highlight failed drug prohibition policies. They saved two teenagers from prison by asking the judge to put them on a restorative justice scheme. The teenage dealers had been selling ecstasy on to their friends in north Devon from stashes they had originally purchased from the dark web. Claire\u2019s son Luke died in 2017 after ingesting two ecstasy tablets the duo sold him before an under-18s disco party. Esther Campbell and her mother not only forgave the pair and persuaded the court not to imprison them but have since joined an organisation which aims to have all drugs legalised and regulated across the UK. Luke\u2019s mother and sister said they wanted to use his death to campaign against prohibition, which they believe puts more people in mortal peril from adulterated or untested, dangerously strong drugs. Sporting small tattoos of lightning flashes on their wrists, a tribute to Luke who died during an electric storm over southwest England, Claire Campbell described how he lost his life in May 2017 just after school lessons ended for the year. \u201cLuke was full of energy, life, love and laughter.

Police discovered quickly that two older boys one year ahead of Luke at school had sold him the tablets. Esther said that from the moment she and her mother discovered who the main suspects were \u201cthe last thing we wanted was revenge\u201d. \u201cThe hardest part for us was when the boys were arrested we were not able to go near and tell them that we didn\u2019t want revenge,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were just selling it to their mates in college and school. It was social supply not some hardened dealer up an alleyway flogging drugs to strangers.\u201d Her mother said the family \u201cmade it very clear to the police team about how we felt and our concerns for their welfare, especially their mental welfare\u201d.

Since the government announced it would abandon most EU meetings from 1 September, a British minister or official has attended eight out of 15 ministerial meetings, according to research by the Guardian. The purpose of mostly quitting the EU council of ministers \u2013 one of the bloc\u2019s most powerful decision-making bodies \u2013 was to allow officials to focus on UK\u2019s \u201cfuture relationship with the EU and other partners around the world\u201d the government had said in the summer. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay said attendance would be reduced by \u201cover half\u201d to \u201cfree up time for ministers and their officials to get on with preparing for our departure on 31 October and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead\u201d. Barclay attended an EU council last week dedicated to EU enlargement in the western Balkans. With Brexit talks at a crucial stage, he also met Ireland\u2019s foreign minister Simon Coveney, as well as ministers or officials from Poland, Greece, Denmark, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Portugal.

But British officials have also taken part in talks touching on the EU\u2019s post-Brexit future. The UK\u2019s deputy ambassador to Brussels, Katrina Williams, attended all-day talks on reforming the common agricultural policy and the EU fisheries fund after 2020, as well as preparations for the EU\u2019s annual negotiations with Norway on fishing quotas. Another UK official attended a meeting of finance ministers to discuss the EU\u2019s anti-money laundering action plan, while an unnamed UK representative took part in discussions on future EU trade policy. The UK skipped meetings on the rule of law in Hungary, transport, energy and agriculture. Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies, who chairs the European Parliament\u2019s fisheries committee, said the empty chair policy was \u201cjust another silly gesture like not signing the letter\u201d, referring to the prime minister\u2019s grudging request for a Brexit delay beyond 31 October. \u201cAs for the people who are not attending the meetings: they are phoning up their friends from other countries to find out what is going on so they can report back to Whitehall,\u201d he said.

As autumn slides into winter, mist turns to drizzle and sunset is replaced by mid-afternoon gloom, it can be hard to prepare for the months ahead. What to wear, how to warm up, even how to summon up the energy to get through the season. We asked a range of people whose outdoor work \u2013 from scaffolding to veterinary medicine \u2013 makes them experts in winter survival for their tips.</p> <p>The greatest hurdle to winter living is state of mind. To a greater or lesser extent, all of us will find our mood affected by changes in weather, reduced daylight and a drop in temperature. The secret, says Graham Singer, a scaffolder working across Essex and London, is to give yourself milestones. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it since I was 15, so I know it\u2019s coming,\u201d he laughs. \u201cSometimes, you know as soon as you step out of the vehicle that everything\u2019s going to be soaked in a few minutes, so you resign yourself to that fact. Just keep in mind that in a few hours, you\u2019ll be back in the warm. Take it hour by hour \u2013 don\u2019t think about the whole day, but just the next job. Tomorrow can\u2019t be any worse.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e228c4713ac697234fa79811a16defd135afb71b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e228c4713ac697234fa79811a16defd135afb71b/0_388_3997_2636/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Issa Robson: \u2018If you\u2019re in the right coat, you can do anything.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Issa Robson: \u2018If you\u2019re in the right coat, you can do anything.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image provided by Issa Robson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Issa Robson, a vet who works in Northumberland with large animals, takes it one step further, saying that, with the right protection in place, cold weather can make you feel pretty powerful. \u201cI don\u2019t think: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s raining,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cOnce I\u2019ve got all my kit on I actually feel pretty invincible. We lived on the west coast of Scotland so I learned that, if you\u2019re in the right coat, you can do anything.\u201d Cold, she says, can also be a question of attitude. \u201cAs long as your core is warm \u2013 your neck and chest \u2013 you can be pretty self-sustainable. Your fingers and feet might be cold, but you don\u2019t feel cold yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Professional dog walker Sheila Mathieson has perhaps my favourite motto when it comes to working outside: you can only get wet once. \u201cOnce you\u2019re wet, you\u2019re wet \u2013 that\u2019s as bad as it\u2019s going to get. Nothing changes. That\u2019s your lot,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to look forward to getting back inside, jumping in the shower and getting dry. There\u2019s no point thinking about what it\u2019s going to be like out there. Just bite the bullet and get out there. I tell myself I have no choice; the dogs come first.\u201d</p> <p>Once the temperature starts to drop, it is hard to overestimate the importance of movement. Tim Wright, a postman from Oxford, says that if you can keep moving for a quarter of an hour, you can overcome whatever the weather is doing around you. \u201cFor the first 10 or 15 minutes when you start, everything is frozen. Minus 12C is pretty extreme but when there\u2019s a hard frost, as long as you keep going for that first 15 minutes, you\u2019re fine. We have to wear fingerless gloves because we need to feel the letters, so the tips of our fingers are freezing. But, like I said, just keep moving. After that: bingo. The key is to keep your body pumping.\u201d</p> <p>When working as a lifeguard at the open-air pools on Hampstead Heath in London, I was advised to do as much exercise as I could during what little daylight we could find. That might mean a bike ride after your shift or, for office workers, a jog during your lunch break. Getting a hit of endorphins on a cold Tuesday in February can make all the difference to your immune system and your mental health.</p> <p>As anyone who has ever had to play netball in January in borrowed school shorts and a T-shirt can tell you; clothing is important. Everybody I spoke to mentioned base layers. When I was a child, my father, a builder, would go off to work on a roof or digging foundations with a pair of my mum\u2019s tights under his work trousers. These days, says Singer, everybody from scaffolders to footballers should invest in a pair of thermal joggers and a couple of tops. \u201cStart with as many layers as you can. Then, as the day goes on \u2013 particularly if it\u2019s a nice, crisp winter day \u2013 you\u2019ll be taking one off every half-hour. Mind you, by the end of the day, you\u2019ll be putting them back on again.\u201d</p> <p>For Robson, the right gear starts from the bottom. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of big pants,\u201d she says down the phone from her unheated kitchen. \u201cPants that don\u2019t cover your waist are a waste of time. If you want to stay warm, you can\u2019t have that bit of your back exposed.\u201d She also recommends thermal leggings and snow gear. \u201cWhen I was working for long stretches in minus 16C, I wore my snowboarding trousers. They\u2019re insulated and quite waterproof.\u201d But her favourite bit of kit is Smartwool mountaineering socks. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like having a carpet in your sock.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11b5dc6981b3d98b129c1a567e5c11bd5b6b935c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b5dc6981b3d98b129c1a567e5c11bd5b6b935c/0_207_2448_2241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hollie Newton: 'In the depths of winter, I wear bright yellow Dunlop wellies.'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"915\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hollie Newton: \u2018In the depths of winter, I wear bright yellow Dunlop wellies.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image provided by Hollie Newton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hollie Newton, a writer and fisherwoman living in Dorset, tells me that what you keep in your coat pockets is just as important as the coat itself. \u201cI always have a couple of those glove warmers in my pockets, as well as a vacuum flask with a really good hot chocolate.\u201d On her feet? \u201cOn the boat I tend to be barefoot \u2013 I really do love the cold \u2013 but in the real depths of winter, I wear bright yellow Dunlop wellies. I actually think if you try not to get wet, you\u2019ve lost the game before you even start.\u201d </p> <p>For agricultural workers, cold frosty mornings will often coincide with fiddly outdoor jobs such as raising electric fences, filling drinking troughs or attending to livestock. \u201cI put on a barrier cream every night because once your hands get chapped, cracked or split \u2013 particularly if you\u2019re working with water \u2013 it becomes pretty unbearable,\u201d says Charles Bennett, an organic farmer who works near Tiddington in Warwickshire. \u201cCowmen have this lanolin-type stuff they put on the cows\u2019 udders that also protects their hands.\u201d</p> <p>For Kelvin Markham, a builder and maintenance worker based in Oxfordshire, an upbeat disposition and physically active job are all you need. \u201cMy wife says I\u2019ve got rhino skin \u2013 all the rain, the cold, it just seems to slide off me. Dig in, throw yourself into it and you\u2019ll soon get hot. Even in mid-winter, when it\u2019s below freezing, you\u2019ll still see me in just a jumper after a couple of hours.\u201d</p> <p>While cold winter days can be draining, they are hopefully balanced out by the promise of the long warm days that will eventually come round again. \u201cSometimes, we\u2019ll joke to each other; what the hell are we doing here? Standing out here, in this weather, with our hands around freezing cold metal tubes, on scaffolding boards that are three inches thick with snow,\u201d says Singer. \u201cBut I do enjoy what I do. Even during the winter I wouldn\u2019t change it.\u201d</p>",

Just keep in mind that in a few hours, you\u2019ll be back in the warm. Take it hour by hour \u2013 don\u2019t think about the whole day, but just the next job. Tomorrow can\u2019t be any worse.\u201d Issa Robson, a vet who works in Northumberland with large animals, takes it one step further, saying that, with the right protection in place, cold weather can make you feel pretty powerful. \u201cI don\u2019t think: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s raining,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cOnce I\u2019ve got all my kit on I actually feel pretty invincible. We lived on the west coast of Scotland so I learned that, if you\u2019re in the right coat, you can do anything.\u201d Cold, she says, can also be a question of attitude. \u201cAs long as your core is warm \u2013 your neck and chest \u2013 you can be pretty self-sustainable. Your fingers and feet might be cold, but you don\u2019t feel cold yourself.\u201d Professional dog walker Sheila Mathieson has perhaps my favourite motto when it comes to working outside: you can only get wet once. \u201cOnce you\u2019re wet, you\u2019re wet \u2013 that\u2019s as bad as it\u2019s going to get. Nothing changes. That\u2019s your lot,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to look forward to getting back inside, jumping in the shower and getting dry. There\u2019s no point thinking about what it\u2019s going to be like out there. Just bite the bullet and get out there. I tell myself I have no choice; the dogs come first.\u201d Once the temperature starts to drop, it is hard to overestimate the importance of movement. Tim Wright, a postman from Oxford, says that if you can keep moving for a quarter of an hour, you can overcome whatever the weather is doing around you. \u201cFor the first 10 or 15 minutes when you start, everything is frozen. Minus 12C is pretty extreme but when there\u2019s a hard frost, as long as you keep going for that first 15 minutes, you\u2019re fine. We have to wear fingerless gloves because we need to feel the letters, so the tips of our fingers are freezing. But, like I said, just keep moving. After that: bingo. The key is to keep your body pumping.\u201d When working as a lifeguard at the open-air pools on Hampstead Heath in London, I was advised to do as much exercise as I could during what little daylight we could find. That might mean a bike ride after your shift or, for office workers, a jog during your lunch break. Getting a hit of endorphins on a cold Tuesday in February can make all the difference to your immune system and your mental health. As anyone who has ever had to play netball in January in borrowed school shorts and a T-shirt can tell you; clothing is important. Everybody I spoke to mentioned base layers. When I was a child, my father, a builder, would go off to work on a roof or digging foundations with a pair of my mum\u2019s tights under his work trousers. These days, says Singer, everybody from scaffolders to footballers should invest in a pair of thermal joggers and a couple of tops. \u201cStart with as many layers as you can. Then, as the day goes on \u2013 particularly if it\u2019s a nice, crisp winter day \u2013 you\u2019ll be taking one off every half-hour. Mind you, by the end of the day, you\u2019ll be putting them back on again.\u201d For Robson, the right gear starts from the bottom. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of big pants,\u201d she says down the phone from her unheated kitchen. \u201cPants that don\u2019t cover your waist are a waste of time. If you want to stay warm, you can\u2019t have that bit of your back exposed.\u201d She also recommends thermal leggings and snow gear. \u201cWhen I was working for long stretches in minus 16C, I wore my snowboarding trousers. They\u2019re insulated and quite waterproof.\u201d But her favourite bit of kit is Smartwool mountaineering socks. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like having a carpet in your sock.\u201d Hollie Newton, a writer and fisherwoman living in Dorset, tells me that what you keep in your coat pockets is just as important as the coat itself. \u201cI always have a couple of those glove warmers in my pockets, as well as a vacuum flask with a really good hot chocolate.\u201d On her feet? \u201cOn the boat I tend to be barefoot \u2013 I really do love the cold \u2013 but in the real depths of winter, I wear bright yellow Dunlop wellies. I actually think if you try not to get wet, you\u2019ve lost the game before you even start.\u201d For agricultural workers, cold frosty mornings will often coincide with fiddly outdoor jobs such as raising electric fences, filling drinking troughs or attending to livestock. \u201cI put on a barrier cream every night because once your hands get chapped, cracked or split \u2013 particularly if you\u2019re working with water \u2013 it becomes pretty unbearable,\u201d says Charles Bennett, an organic farmer who works near Tiddington in Warwickshire. \u201cCowmen have this lanolin-type stuff they put on the cows\u2019 udders that also protects their hands.\u201d For Kelvin Markham, a builder and maintenance worker based in Oxfordshire, an upbeat disposition and physically active job are all you need. \u201cMy wife says I\u2019ve got rhino skin \u2013 all the rain, the cold, it just seems to slide off me. Dig in, throw yourself into it and you\u2019ll soon get hot. Even in mid-winter, when it\u2019s below freezing, you\u2019ll still see me in just a jumper after a couple of hours.\u201d While cold winter days can be draining, they are hopefully balanced out by the promise of the long warm days that will eventually come round again. \u201cSometimes, we\u2019ll joke to each other; what the hell are we doing here? Standing out here, in this weather, with our hands around freezing cold metal tubes, on scaffolding boards that are three inches thick with snow,\u201d says Singer. \u201cBut I do enjoy what I do. Even during the winter I wouldn\u2019t change it.\u201d",

Casado said Catalonia was a \u201cfundamental part of Spain\u201d, adding: \u201cAbove all, it\u2019s a land totally opposed to the violence, intolerance and sectarianism of the independence movement.\u201d Rivera said: \u201cThere are more of us who want to be united than want separation.\u201d On Sunday, the pro-independence Committees for the Defence of the Republic set up roadblocks and blocked railway lines with tree trunks in an attempt to prevent protesters from reaching the march in central Barcelona. A sit-in was also staged at the city\u2019s main railway station. On Saturday, about 20,000 people had joined a rally in support of Spanish unity staged in central Madrid by Vox. A huge Spanish flag, 50 metres long and 20 metres wide, was unfurled over the crowd, who called for the imprisonment of Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan president who fled to Belgium two years ago to avoid arrest for leading the push for secession. Vox\u2019s leader, Santiago Abascal, urged the suspension of Catalan self-government, saying: \u201cSpain isn\u2019t up for discussion; Spain is to be defended at all costs.\u201d Catalonia is deeply divided over the issue of independence. Popular support for seceding from Spain \u2013 which reached a record high of 48.7% in October 2017 \u2013 currently stands at 44%, with 48.3% of Catalans opposing it. The protest on Sunday took place on the second anniversary of the illegal unilateral declaration of independence by the Catalan parliament. The Spanish government responded by sacking Puigdemont\u2019s administration and assuming direct control of Catalonia. Following the supreme court verdict on 14 October, a judge reissued the international arrest warrant for Puigdemont, and an extradition hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?</strong></h2> \n<p>Baghdadi is thought to have been born in the central Iraqi city of Samarra in 1971. Though a weak student, whose poor eyesight disqualified him from joining the Iraqi military, he rose to command al-Qaida\u2019s Iraqi division and then broke away to form Islamic State (Isis).</p> \n<p>In July 2014, shortly after Isis said it had established a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, Baghdadi delivered a sermon from a mosque in the captured Iraqi city of Mosul. Appearing unmasked for the first time, he declared himself to be the caliph: the political and religious leader of the global Muslim community.</p> \n<p>His declaration was roundly rejected by almost all Islamic religious authorities but his caliphate became a magnet for thousands of foreign fighters and women. The group attempted not just to hold territory but to administer it like a state, establishing a brutal justice system, collecting taxes and doling out public services.</p> \n<p>Baghdadi had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/29/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-appears-in-video-for-first-time-in-five-years\">been seen publicly</a> on only one other occasion: an 18-minute video released in April this year. Since 2016 he had a $25m bounty on his head.</p> \n<p>He had been reported to have suffered serious injuries in airstrikes over the years and before Sunday there had occasionally been speculation that he had been killed, but he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/28/isis-releases-new-recording-of-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi\">continued to resurface</a> in audio tapes and videos.</p> \n<h2><strong>Why is his death significant?</strong></h2> \n<p>In March, Isis surrendered its final territorial stronghold in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/03/isis-nowhere-baghouz-last-stronghold-syrian-defence-forces\">Syrian city of Baghouz</a>, a deep material blow but also a symbolic one, depriving the group of its ability to claim legitimacy as a restored Islamic caliphate.</p> \n<p>The defeat prompted Baghdadi\u2019s first public appearance in five years in a video that was interpreted as an attempt to fortify his leadership \u2013 in the face of dissent within the ranks \u2013 and to demonstrate that the group continued to exist even without its territory.</p> \n<p>Baghdadi was not just an operational leader, but a symbol of Isis\u2019s Islamic credentials: he had claimed to come from the same tribe as the prophet Muhammad, to be a descendant of the prophet\u2019s grandson, and to fulfil the necessary ideological and religious tests rightfully to claim leadership of Muslims.</p> \n<p>His death is another strike against Isis\u2019 purported legitimacy, leaving it less able to claim to be any different from other violent extremist groups.</p> \n<h2>How and where did he die?</h2> \n<p>In his address to the press on Sunday Donald Trump said Baghdadi died during a raid by US special forces on his Syrian safehouse in Idlib province in north-west Syria on Saturday night. Baghdadi fled into a dead-end tunnel and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three of his children, Trump said. A DNA field test was conducted, and some of his remains were taken by US forces, he added.</p> \n<p>Reports quoting anonymous American, Iranian and Iraqi officials earlier said the raid took place in Barisha. Video posted from the town showed a building reduced to rubble, bodies scattered in the area and deep craters in the ground.</p> \n<h2>What do we know about his movements prior to his death?</h2> \n<p>Baghdadi was thought to have been hiding in eastern Syria along the border with his native Iraq. He is said to have used extensive measures to avoid surveillance, never using mobile phones, frequently changing safe houses and avoiding travelling in convoys that might draw attention.</p> \n<p>Few would have guessed that he was in Idlib because the province, which is under siege by Russian and Syrian forces, is mostly controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist militia that is opposed to Isis and has been known to hunt down and execute suspected members of the group.</p> \n<p>Some have speculated that Baghdadi might have arrived recently, fleeing the recent Turkish incursion in the north-east of the country, and the subsequent advances made by the Syrian and Russian armies.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? Baghdadi is thought to have been born in the central Iraqi city of Samarra in 1971. Though a weak student, whose poor eyesight disqualified him from joining the Iraqi military, he rose to command al-Qaida\u2019s Iraqi division and then broke away to form Islamic State (Isis). In July 2014, shortly after Isis said it had established a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, Baghdadi delivered a sermon from a mosque in the captured Iraqi city of Mosul. Appearing unmasked for the first time, he declared himself to be the caliph: the political and religious leader of the global Muslim community. His declaration was roundly rejected by almost all Islamic religious authorities but his caliphate became a magnet for thousands of foreign fighters and women. The group attempted not just to hold territory but to administer it like a state, establishing a brutal justice system, collecting taxes and doling out public services. Baghdadi had been seen publicly on only one other occasion: an 18-minute video released in April this year. Since 2016 he had a $25m bounty on his head. He had been reported to have suffered serious injuries in airstrikes over the years and before Sunday there had occasionally been speculation that he had been killed, but he continued to resurface in audio tapes and videos. Why is his death significant? In March, Isis surrendered its final territorial stronghold in the Syrian city of Baghouz, a deep material blow but also a symbolic one, depriving the group of its ability to claim legitimacy as a restored Islamic caliphate. The defeat prompted Baghdadi\u2019s first public appearance in five years in a video that was interpreted as an attempt to fortify his leadership \u2013 in the face of dissent within the ranks \u2013 and to demonstrate that the group continued to exist even without its territory. Baghdadi was not just an operational leader, but a symbol of Isis\u2019s Islamic credentials: he had claimed to come from the same tribe as the prophet Muhammad, to be a descendant of the prophet\u2019s grandson, and to fulfil the necessary ideological and religious tests rightfully to claim leadership of Muslims. His death is another strike against Isis\u2019 purported legitimacy, leaving it less able to claim to be any different from other violent extremist groups. How and where did he die? In his address to the press on Sunday Donald Trump said Baghdadi died during a raid by US special forces on his Syrian safehouse in Idlib province in north-west Syria on Saturday night. Baghdadi fled into a dead-end tunnel and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three of his children, Trump said. A DNA field test was conducted, and some of his remains were taken by US forces, he added. Reports quoting anonymous American, Iranian and Iraqi officials earlier said the raid took place in Barisha. Video posted from the town showed a building reduced to rubble, bodies scattered in the area and deep craters in the ground. What do we know about his movements prior to his death? Baghdadi was thought to have been hiding in eastern Syria along the border with his native Iraq. He is said to have used extensive measures to avoid surveillance, never using mobile phones, frequently changing safe houses and avoiding travelling in convoys that might draw attention. Few would have guessed that he was in Idlib because the province, which is under siege by Russian and Syrian forces, is mostly controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist militia that is opposed to Isis and has been known to hunt down and execute suspected members of the group. Some have speculated that Baghdadi might have arrived recently, fleeing the recent Turkish incursion in the north-east of the country, and the subsequent advances made by the Syrian and Russian armies.",

About 690 new business jets are expected to take to the skies in 2019, a 9% increase on 2018, as businesses and the wealthy refresh their fleets with new models released by three of the world\u2019s biggest private jet manufacturers. Despite their huge carbon footprint, demand for new private jets is expected to continue to grow next year, according to the report. Over the next decade, the number of new private jets taking to the skies is expected to total 7,600 \u2013 costing buyers a combined $248bn (\u00a3193bn). One-fifth of the new jets is expected to be ordered by \u201csuper-emitter\u201d celebrities and other members of the richest 1% of the population, who use the planes to fly between their homes in the world\u2019s most desirable locations. The jets are also bought by big companies to ferry executives across the world. There are currently more than 4,600 private jets operating. \u201cIt is the introduction of many new aircraft models at the same time, with new clean streamline designs, that is driving demand for new private jets,\u201d Gaetan Handfield, senior manager of marketing analysis at Honeywell Aerospace and author of the report said. \u201cPeople like to have the newest and best jets.\u201d Handfield said a new range of jets produced by Bombardier, Gulfstream and Cessna are proving popular with buyers, as they have extended range that can allow executives to fly as far as New York to Beijing non-stop.

The prominent Brexit campaigner and former environment minister set up the thinktank, UK 2020, five years ago. It paid for 10 overseas trips by Paterson, including visits to the US to campaign for a hard Brexit. MPs are required to declare the source of funds for any overseas visit valued at more than \u00a3300. However, as a private company, his thinktank was not required to identify its donors.

The company also published an edition of its Wetherspoon News magazine featuring a two-page pro-Brexit editorial by Martin, nine pages of Eurosceptic articles and just four pages of pro-EU articles.

The Light Salon has various machines available, but in my case the aesthetician, Amy Fiddler, will set me up beneath the <a href=\"https://int.aesthetic.lutronic.com/intl/products/healite-ii/\" title=\"\">Healite</a>, a unit developed by Dr Glen Calderhead, the man who is generally considered to be one of the godfathers of low-level light therapy (LLLT). The Healite uses light-emitting diode (LED) technology, delivered at a wavelength of 830nm, to promote cellular function. LEDs may be blue, red, or yellow. Blue lights are used to treat acne, killing the bacteria that are its cause and regulating excess oil. Red lights stimulate collagen and elastin, the two holy grails of anti-ageing. Yellow lights help with wound healing and rejuvenation, and temporarily increase blood circulation. This machine uses a combination of red and yellow lights, arranged on a unit some 15 to 20cm away from my face, and though the results are incremental \u2013 a full course of 13 treatments (yours for \u00a3350) is recommended to achieve lasting effects \u2013 I\u2019m told that I am likely, nevertheless, to see an improvement in my skin in the next 24 hours. And so, I sit back and relax\u2026</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Its uses are not limited to skincare. It works for pain relief as well</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the line<em><strong> </strong></em>from Seoul, South Korea, Calderhead is telling me the story of the development of LED therapy and of how he first came to be involved with it. According to Calderhead, who trained in the UK as a pathologist and who maintains a healthy Scottish accent, phototherapy has two true godfathers. The first of these is Endre Mester, a Hungarian medic who, in the late 1960s, began experimenting with the effects of lasers on skin cancer. \u201cHe published a paper in which he revealed that he had successfully cured the leg ulcers of patients using a red light laser,\u201d says Calderhead. The second is Professor Harry Whelan, a neurologist who, in the late 1980s, was working at Nasa\u2019s medicine laboratory. Having developed a blue light to be used to activate chlorophyll on the space station\u2019s hydroponic plant farms, he began to examine possible medical uses for the diodes. He then developed a red LED that operated at 633nm, and subsequently published a paper looking at its effect on pain attenuation and wound healing. Could Calderhead be described as a third godfather? \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d he says, laughing.</p> <p>In 1976, Calderhead went to Japan to study on a six-month sabbatical and there he met Dr Toshio Ohshiro, an \u201coutstanding\u201d laser surgeon. \u201cI was fascinated by his work to the extent that, after two weeks, he suggested I stay and study with him,\u201d says Calderhead. \u201cIn the course of one laser treatment, to remove a birthmark on a woman\u2019s sternum, he found he\u2019d incidentally cured her post-herpetic neuralgia [a painful complication of shingles that affects the nerves]. Post-herpetic neuralgia lives in the intercostal muscles. We thought about this and we surmised that some of the light energy had penetrated beyond its target at a very, very low level \u2013 and this, of course, tied in with the findings of laser surgeons like Mester.\u201d Ohshiro and Calderhead were duly encouraged to branch out, from laser surgery into laser therapy. \u201cWe played around with wavelengths and LEDs, and in 1988 we published the first book on LLLT.\u201d</p> <p>In 2002, Calderhead met the CEO of a company called Phototherapeutics, the manufacturer of an LED system named Omnilux. Soon afterwards, he became its clinical director. At this point, Omnilux was working on two heads: red and blue. Patients treated with red light for non-melanoma skin cancers on their faces reported that afterwards their skin was in much better condition generally. The blue had proved effective in treating acne, but only for a limited period. \u201cMy first job was to work out why eruptions happened again, and why the light also turned the skin darker,\u201d he says. This led him to use both lights together (previously they had been used separately). He also changed the frequency of the wavelength from 415nm to 830nm. This new, combined head was effective for both healing and rejuvenation: 830nm was, he says, \u201cthe magic number\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a895136758091726f7b2e37129e5dd7c94b448b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a895136758091726f7b2e37129e5dd7c94b448b3/0_130_2004_1202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Low light \u2018godfather\u2019: Dr Glen Calderhead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Low light \u2018godfather\u2019: Dr Glen Calderhead</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Calderhead now works at Lutronic, the Seoul-based manufacturer of the Healite. So how does LED therapy work? \u201cLLLT is an exchange of photon energy. Each photon is a packet of pure energy without mass. The energy passes into the energy pool of the cell. If it has a job to do, it will do it better. The part of the dermis that makes collagen, for instance, will make better collagen faster. It produces a viable clinical effect with no damage.\u201d Its uses are not limited to skincare. \u201cIn Australia, where clinics are taking it up, it has been found to be fantastic for burns.\u201d Does Calderhead use it himself? \u201cYes. For pain relief. I have sciatic neuralgia in my left hip \u2013 an old rugby injury. I put myself under the Healite twice a week. If I miss this, I\u2019m in agony.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some see it not as a backlash against Botox, but close to it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Calderhead believes the future for LED therapy is, well, extremely bright \u2013 though hospitals in the west remain reluctant to invest in it. \u201cThey have shied away because it is so associated with aesthetics,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we can chip away at this reluctance, by making it easier to understand.\u201d He believes LED therapy could, in the future, be deployed far more widely. \u201cAnything that involves wound healing and pain attenuation. It will work on the muscular-skeletal system. It will work on nerve injury. Recently, it has been used in cerebral trauma, such as stroke. This is why I call one of my presentations \u2018Join the Healing Revolution\u2019.\u201d What about side effects? Are there any? \u201cNo, no. People always ask. For 830, there are really none. For 633, you have to be careful what else is on the skin \u2013 for instance, perfume \u2013 because you can get a photosensitive reaction.\u201d</p> <p>In the beauty world, the popularity of LED therapy is growing exponentially. In part, this is due simply to its increasing availability. According to Louise Taylor, one of the founders of Dermalux, a Warrington-based manufacturer of LED systems, some 1,000 clinics in the UK now use her company\u2019s devices. \u201cThere is a feeling in the market that LED is something you can have on an ongoing basis,\u201d she says. \u201cUnless you have issues of photosensitivity, there are no real limits as to how much of it you can have, and that\u2019s one reason why it is expanding in clinics.\u201d But it is also the result of word of mouth, particularly on social media.</p> <p>When home-use LED light masks came on to the market they became an Instagram trend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lena-dunham\" title=\"\">Lena Dunham</a> among those who posed wearing one (hers was by Neutrogena, and cost only \u00a327.50; however, last July this product was withdrawn from sale in the US following \u201creports of visual effects\u201d by users). More recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/victoria-beckham\" title=\"\">Victoria Beckham</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexa-chung\" title=\"\">Alexa Chung</a> have posted pictures of themselves wearing home-use masks (the effect is spooky: sort of Hannibal Lecter meets the Cybermen, with added colour).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7dd4d43dd16d6ab49471c1e010db34e542a09883\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dd4d43dd16d6ab49471c1e010db34e542a09883/0_179_3136_1882/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Facing facts: a group tries the Neutrogena mask, which was later withdrawn from sale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Facing facts: a group tries the Neutrogena mask, which was later withdrawn from sale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some see it, too, as a cultural shift: not a backlash against Botox exactly, but something close to it. \u201cI think there is that movement, yes,\u201d says <a href=\"https://drdennisgross.com/\" title=\"\">Dr Dennis Gross</a>, the American dermatologist and skin-care guru whose home LED mask retails for \u00a3430. \u201cI think people want prevention right now, and that is one positive benefit of LED.

It\u2019s one of the most efficacious treatments in dermatology.\u201d His patients love the fact that it requires no down time \u2013 no recovery period \u2013 and that if they own a mask, they can, as is not the case with Botox, have treatments at home. (Do the masks work? Calderhead says they will never be as good as a clinical-style system; the lights are too close to the skin to be fully efficient.)</p> <p>Hannah Measures, one of the co-founders of the Light Salon \u2013 which will shortly launch a new LED \u201cbib\u201d to enable clients to treat their d\u00e9colletage \u2013 agrees that clients are increasingly interested in a more gentle, more holistic approach to their skin. \u201cThere is a growing body of people who think: we can\u2019t stop ourselves getting older and we don\u2019t really mind wrinkles, but still, we want to be the best possible version of ourselves.\u201d LED therapy, she says, connects to \u201cwellbeing\u201d as much as it does to anti-ageing. \u201cOur new bib can be placed on the shoulder and, in trials, some patients have said it helps with pain relief,\u201d she says.

Well, the experience is rather lovely. I hate the winter and the warmth on my face is delicious. I like having to sit still, too: an enforced period of calm. Afterwards, I do glow a little (though we might attribute this to several things). But alas, I will also develop a somewhat teenage-looking spot the next morning. Am I tempted to sign up for a full course? Yes, but only after my conversation with Calderhead, LED\u2019s great evangelist. As he puts it: \u201cWe have proved that collagen and elastin are both improved by LLLT. But education is important. This won\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d</p>",

Am I tempted to sign up for a full course? Yes, but only after my conversation with Calderhead, LED\u2019s great evangelist. As he puts it: \u201cWe have proved that collagen and elastin are both improved by LLLT. But education is important. This won\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>You walk up many flights of stairs to reach Celia Paul\u2019s flat, but the climb is worth it. The windows of her studio and bedroom look down on the courtyard and facade of the British Museum. All the world and its history, in every available London light, is just across the street. Paul has lived and painted here \u2013 the two things are inseparable in her mind \u2013 since 1982, when she discovered this place with Lucian Freud, her then lover and the father of her only child, Frank, also a painter.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we first came to look,\u201d she recalls, \u201cthe entrance was at the back and the place seemed a bit dingy. It had been bedsits and there were gas fires where you put coins in the meter, but then we came in here and saw these windows and we were just overwhelmed. Lucian put down the cash deposit immediately.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With Lucian there was always this element of control</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Paul, who will turn 60 next month, rented the flat for a couple of years before the landlord offered it for sale. Freud bought it for her for \u00a375,000, \u201cwhich seemed such an incredible lot of money at the time\u201d. It has not changed much in all the time since. There are bare boards on the floor; she points out an old leak in one corner of the ceiling. The studio is empty except for her easel and piles of discarded paint tubes and rags and a mirror, from which Paul constructs her haunting and soulful self-portraits. The only furniture in the adjoining living room is a battered chaise longue and a chair that is smeared, like much else, with paint. There is a single iron-framed bed in one corner. Paul, whose father was the bishop of Bradford, is married to Steven Kupfer, a teacher of philosophy, but they have always kept separate homes. What faith she has herself, she expresses on canvas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"687c13df0d28d6dd01d8f987b44e4556e7541a1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/687c13df0d28d6dd01d8f987b44e4556e7541a1b/0_0_4000_3285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celia Paul Lucian and Me, 2019 Oil on canvas 25.4 x 30.5 cm 10 x 12 in \u00a9 Celia Paul Courtesy the artist and Victoria Miro, London/Venice\" width=\"1000\" height=\"821\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucian and Me, 2019, an image from Celia Paul\u2019s upcoming show at Victoria Miro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Celia Paul Courtesy the artist and Victoria Miro, London/Venice</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is not, she admits to me with an apologetic giggle quite early in our conversation, a great lover of conversation. She has struggled her whole life with the terrors of small talk. Her self-containment, her vivid and protected world of interiors, is what gives her painting its enormous affective power. Paul describes herself as an autobiographer rather than a portrait painter by which she means she paints mostly herself and those she loves \u2013 her four sisters, her late mother, her husband, her son. Each of those singular figures emerge in her work as if from a private netherworld of thoughtful and anxious attention. For a while the family lived near Haworth, and the Bront\u00ebs have been touchstones for all of the sisters. They have each lost count of the number of times they have read <em>Jane Eyre</em>. Something of the ghost of that association animates a poetic, sometimes painfully honest memoir that Paul has written, which is the occasion for our interview.</p> <p>Before we sit down to talk she shows me the new paintings that she plans to include in an <a href=\"https://www.victoria-miro.com/exhibitions/548/\" title=\"\">imminent exhibition</a> of her work at the Victoria Miro gallery in London, which will open at the same time as her book appears. Paul has lately been granted her due as a soft-spoken star of British figurative art, \u201can artist like no other\u201d <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/letter-london-celia-paul-henri-matisse\" title=\"\">according to the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/letter-london-celia-paul-henri-matisse\" title=\"\">New Yorker</a></em>. She hoists her new canvases, which have their backs to the room, one by one to her easel, while offering a commentary about how vulnerable it feels to show work in this way.</p> <p>The paintings each infuse the room with curious light, and put a pin in the map of Paul\u2019s life. First up is a meditative seascape that she painted on a recent foray out to Los Angeles for an exhibition of her work. \u201cI dreaded going because I never go anywhere\u2026\u201d she says, \u201cbut the ocean proved inspiring.\u201d The light and the vegetation stirred memories of her very early childhood in India, where her father worked as a missionary. \u201cAnd that made me wonder about my dread of going away\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Is the dread about the travel, the flying?</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind flying but I suffer from homesickness terribly. I can\u2019t stop thinking about getting back to my space here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4b47ab4934321cbf52639ec690cdd5567143e71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4b47ab4934321cbf52639ec690cdd5567143e71/216_133_2685_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celia Paul, 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"990\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celia Paul, 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: image courtesy Celia Paul</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That space is then occupied with an ethereal picture of her younger sister Kate, a writer and former actress, who became her most frequent sitter after their mother, at 80, was unable any longer to negotiate the stairs.</p> <p>In her book, Kate emerges as Paul\u2019s first confidante and soulmate, the sounding board for the fears and excitements of her involvement with Freud, whom she met, aged 18 when she was his student at the Slade School of Fine Art. Freud was then 55. They became lovers almost immediately, maintained a relationship for nearly a decade and a complicated intimacy that lasted until Freud\u2019s death in 2011.</p> <p>The relationship has led to Paul being routinely identified as another entry in Freud\u2019s extensive catalogue of lovers and subjects \u2013 she sat for several portraits \u2013 rather than as a formidable artist herself. She sees her book, and her self-portraits, as hard-won acts of liberation and defiance at that characterisation.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Lucian died I was shocked by how I was seen in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cI was \u2018Lucian Freud\u2019s muse\u2019. I felt I needed to do something about this. I thought the way to do that would be to make this story my own.\u201d</p> <p>She shows me another portrait, this one of her husband, Steven Kupfer, a tender painting that wants to bristle with its subject\u2019s quickness of mind.</p> <p>She pauses before it. \u201cSteven is very ill,\u201d she says. \u201cThough he does not look it. He has had bowel cancer and now he has liver cancer. I painted this in May. He is having chemo still and tests for which we always hold our breath. Psychologically he is very strong, reading madly, thinking about the transcendental ego. His morale is tremendously good.\u201d When Paul smiles, she becomes a different person, suddenly girlish. \u201cHe used to think about philosophy when he sat for me,\u201d she says, \u201cbut he often used to fall asleep. So now he memorises cryptic crossword clues before he comes and solves them in his head.\u201d</p> <p>Kupfer, 78, lives in Kentish Town, a couple of miles north from here. I wonder how their marriage works \u2013 was it never their plan to live together?</p> <p>She says that from the beginning \u2013 they married in 2011 \u2013 she made it clear that she needed this private space and he was OK with that. \u201cHe had lived with people before, but he took to the idea. We go out to supper with each other several times a week,\u201d she says, \u201cand he rings me punctually every day at 3pm and at 9pm. He is clockwork reliable. Compared to Lucian [who would keep her waiting long hours and days and weeks for promised contact], \u201chaving that support is extraordinarily confidence giving.\u201d</p> <p>Her memoir begins pointedly with the moment she met Freud \u2013 he in a perfectly tailored grey wool suit, with a white silk scarf, smoking a Gitane \u2013 on one of her first days at art college, fresh from her girls\u2019 boarding school in Devon. The first half of what follows mines her old diaries and letters and poems to reconstruct the love and longing and frequent despair that the affair caused her. Some scenes are hard to read \u2013 Paul\u2019s account of Freud\u2019s initial forceful physical advances; his insistence that she lie naked for him to paint, imposing an acute vulnerability that made her cry; the one-sided demands and frequent betrayals \u2013 and the more so because they are rendered in her original youthful voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e57547dad1278296f01ae0a4659457d34202732f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e57547dad1278296f01ae0a4659457d34202732f/59_60_3649_6415/569.jpg\" alt=\"Painter and Model, 2012, by Celia Paul\" width=\"569\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Painter and Model, 2012, by Celia Paul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Celia Paul, courtesy the artist and Victoria Miro, London / Venice</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her story emerges from those beginnings, however, to tell a different tale, one that celebrates family and persistent female power. In Freud\u2019s last painting of Paul, she stands fully clothed in this studio, her foot on a tube of paint, with a naked male model, her friend Angus Cook, sprawled on the chaise. Freud seemed to be marking a change in her, a suggestion that she was ready to transition from passive muse to active artist. She is not sure she needed his permission.</p> <p>Her own work subsequently dwelt on just those tensions. Her best-known self-portrait, <em>Painter and Model</em> (2012), was a large-scale intensely layered depiction of herself sitting in a painting smock; the painting was a scene stealer in the 2016 Tate Britain survey of post-war British painting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/04/all-too-human-francis-bacon-lucian-freud-tate-britain-review-absorbing-survey\" title=\"\">All Too Human</a>, alongside the headline acts, Freud and Francis Bacon. The last two new paintings she shows me in her studio, are both new images of herself, now tentatively standing.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first started doing self-portraits \u2013 and I didn\u2019t start until I was in my 40s, quite late \u2013 I did these portraits where my hand was kind of stretched out toward the canvas, as if about to paint,\u201d she says. \u201cI suppose I was imitating those famous poses of Goya or Rembrandt. But something felt so false about that. Somehow women don\u2019t have a secure place in the history of art and to portray myself in this way standing squarely, about to paint, it wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p> <p>The new paintings have been inspired in part by the connection she felt to Paula Rego\u2019s recent exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/12/paula-rego-obedience-defiance-milton-keynes-gallery\" title=\"\">Obedience and Defiance</a>. She laughs. \u201cI think I\u2019m finally ready to stand up from my chair,\u201d she says. She stands back from a version of herself on the easel. \u201cI called it <em>Self-Portrait Standing</em>. This is a kinder one of me than some, I think.\u201d</p> <p>We both stare at the unforgiving, hollow-eyed portrait and I suggest it could be kinder still.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think? This one started as a very much more cruel image. So what I did, there is this painting by Frans Hals, a beautiful painting of a gorgeous young woman I saw, and I did a sketch of it and put it on the easel so that she would look kindly on me while I was doing it.\u201d</p> <p>If Celia Paul had to escape from domineering male presences in her life, she also had to find a role for herself among her sisters (one of whom, Jane, is married to the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams).</p> <p>A portrait she made of the four sisters after her mother died in 2015, <em>My Sisters Mourning</em> seemed to capture something of the form of the famous painting of the Bront\u00eb sisters, by their brother Branwell. She suggests the reference was conscious.</p> <p>\u201cI also did a portrait of Patrick Bront\u00eb [the novelists\u2019 father] and then one of my own father,\u201d she says. \u201cWho died when I was 23. I had been thinking about absent fathers, which I guess is not far from thinking about God.\u201d</p> <p>Has religion been important to her?</p> <p>\u201cFrom the earliest memory every day started with prayer and ended with prayer,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it is still in my bloodstream, even though I am not conventionally religious. I am not good at belonging to groups. But doesn\u2019t everyone think about God?\u201d</p> <p>That tendency, her memoir suggests, was one reason Lucian Freud was drawn to her, and one of her own means of keeping herself apart.</p> <p>\u201cI think what Lucian was most disturbed by,\u201d she says, \u201cwas my kind of stillness. He had no truck with God. He found that difficult to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>And determined to disrupt?</p> <p>\u201cYes absolutely. He found it disturbing even if I looked dreamily out of a window. He wanted me firmly in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc6fdecb91b0302bbb7bf5ca5df7119d277642d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc6fdecb91b0302bbb7bf5ca5df7119d277642d7/0_0_4000_3981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celia Paul My Sisters in Mourning, 2015-2016 Oil on canvas 147.4 x 148 58 1/8 x 58 1/4 \u00a9 Celia Paul Courtesy the artist and Victoria Miro, London/Venice\" width=\"1000\" height=\"995\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">My Sisters in Mourning, 2015-2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Celia Paul Courtesy the artist and Victoria Miro, London/Venice</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Freud encouraged her to think of their relationship like that between the youthful Gwen John and the ageing Auguste Rodin. John gave up painting for a time, \u201cto give herself up to this experience of being in love\u201d with the old master. Early in their affair, Freud encouraged Paul to do the same. Could she see the attraction of that?</p> <p>\u201cI think I might have been attracted to it if I hadn\u2019t known something of Lucian\u2019s past history,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was another of his girlfriends, Susie Boyt, who had also been at the Slade 25 years before me and had had five children, four with Lucian. She had stopped painting. Lucian and Susie went on being very close, and Lucian admired her tremendously, but I had the feeling that Lucian might have said something similar to her once in regard to Gwen John and Rodin.</p> <p>\u201cFor myself, I think Rodin and Lucian were in quite a profound way very different. Some of the greatest things Rodin did were watercolours of naked women. I felt he had a real empathy with women, as separate to himself, and I feel with Lucian there was always this element of control.\u201d</p> <p>Looking back, now she is at Freud\u2019s own age while they were together, does the relationship feel more uncomfortable than it did at the time?</p> <p>\u201cIt does, though when I was at the Slade several of the students were having affairs with tutors. The fact that Lucian said to me subsequently that he only came to the Slade to pick up a girl, didn\u2019t at the time seem shocking to me, or to anyone there. Whereas now to me it does seem shocking. I had approached him in the life room wanting to show him my drawings, because we both had drawn and painted our mothers. I had felt that affinity. But really that wasn\u2019t why he was drawn to me and that felt hurtful at the time.\u201d</p> <p>The relationship with Freud was her first experience with men, she says, which, as her diaries make clear, made it harder to comprehend.</p> <p>\u201cI had been at a girls\u2019 boarding school,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t interested in boys or men, I was interested in art. I was shocked by Lucian pouncing on me. But part of me thought: \u2018Maybe this is what happens.\u2019 I talked to my mother about it. And my mother said to me: \u2018Well, maybe you are in love with him.\u2019 And I thought to myself: \u2018Well, maybe I am.\u2019 Somehow her saying that seemed almost to give permission for all of it.\u201d</p> <p>Though Freud had numerous children \u2013 there are 14 acknowledged sons and daughters but maybe 30 others \u2013 he professed to have no interest in babies. He maintained close relationships with his grown-up offspring \u2013 including Frank Paul \u2013 but could never have been confused for a hands-on father.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6743ef62083b3a6a82437a607629859d494dcfb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6743ef62083b3a6a82437a607629859d494dcfb0/0_0_2894_3458/837.jpg\" alt=\"Girl In A Striped Nightdress, Or Celia 1983-85, by Lucian Freud\" width=\"837\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Girl In A Striped Nightdress, Or Celia 1983-85, by Lucian Freud.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucian Freud Archive / Bridgeman Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Freud began perhaps his most loving portrait of Paul, <em>Girl in a Striped Nightshirt</em> between 1983 and 1985, during which time she became pregnant and gave birth to Frank. \u201cHe was very caring while I was pregnant, we were very close during that time,\u201d Paul recalls. \u201cBut after, he was very pleased that I was going to ask my mother to help look after Frank. He expected me to come and be available as I had been, but obviously my life became more complicated.\u201d In 1985 when Freud made the portrait of Paul standing, and he bought this flat, they \u201cwere drifting apart in all sorts of ways,\u201d Paul says. \u201cWhen I first met Lucian he wasn\u2019t that famous. He was notorious, but he did not have a big international reputation or anything. He was a genuinely Dostoevskian character it seemed to me, living much more on the edge. And then later he became more a national treasure and was quite seduced by that.\u201d</p> <p>When did she last see Freud?</p> <p>\u201cI saw him actually on the day he died,\u201d she says. \u201cI saw him quite regularly at that time. A few weeks before he died I gave him a bath, and he always used to love having his back washed, and I washed his back with a sponge. He was much more gentle then and, of course, he wanted to regale me with stories about being friends with Princess Margaret and all that.\u201d</p> <p>Though she tried several times, Paul never completed a painting of Freud. \u201cI had a mattress on the floor of my studio and he would lie down on that and curl up,\u201d she says. \u201cI got quite far with one painting and then I just thought this isn\u2019t what I want to do and so gradually I stopped.\u201d She once made a pencil drawing of Freud asleep that she liked, but painted over it with a sketch of a kneeling penitent.</p> <p>Later she says, in another context: \u201cIt is quite telling of portraiture that love shines through. It is one of the reasons I know I can\u2019t paint people I don\u2019t love. If it works, it is only in a staged way.\u201d</p> <p>While we talk about this past there is the constant, distant noise from the street below from tourists and school parties visiting the museum. Paul seems suitably raised above that cacophony here.</p> <p>The contrast of stillness is perfect for her, she suggests, though occasionally busking bagpipers below drive her mad. She imagines that in the future she may move away from London in search of greater peace \u2013 perhaps to the Preseli hills in west Wales where she spends holidays \u2013 but it is hard to imagine her apart from this studio.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m a braver person, less anxious than I was,\u201d she says. \u201cMy son is completely independent now. So I am freer than I\u2019ve ever been before.\u201d</p> <p>I ask about the rhythm of her days. She rises early, at five or six, depending on the light, she says. \u201cI have a cup of tea in bed when I look out at the sky. I know a lot of painters boast about working 14 hours a day. But that\u2019s not me. My things tend to come in great bursts. So sometimes I work long hours and then sometimes not many hours at all.\u201d</p> <p>You would hesitate to describe Paul as a confident person, but she is possessed of a quietly cheerful certainty in her powers of persistence. She feels finally, she says, that she might be granted her own space apart from the alpha males of British painting. \u201cOne of the phrases I really don\u2019t like is \u2018in her own right\u2019,\u201d she says, as in: \u201cCelia Paul is also a painter in her own right.\u201d Her voice rises slightly in the stillness of the studio. \u201cI want there to be no question that I am a painter in my own right. I feel that my painting belongs to a whole tradition of British art. I can see connections between my work and Stanley Spencer, and Gwen John and Frank Auerbach. And that is the main way I am connected to Lucian,\u201d she says, firmly, \u201cas part of that spirit of British painting.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Celia Paul\u2019s memoir, <em>Self-Portrait</em>, is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "You walk up many flights of stairs to reach Celia Paul\u2019s flat, but the climb is worth it. The windows of her studio and bedroom look down on the courtyard and facade of the British Museum. All the world and its history, in every available London light, is just across the street. Paul has lived and painted here \u2013 the two things are inseparable in her mind \u2013 since 1982, when she discovered this place with Lucian Freud, her then lover and the father of her only child, Frank, also a painter. \u201cWhen we first came to look,\u201d she recalls, \u201cthe entrance was at the back and the place seemed a bit dingy. It had been bedsits and there were gas fires where you put coins in the meter, but then we came in here and saw these windows and we were just overwhelmed. Lucian put down the cash deposit immediately.\u201d Paul, who will turn 60 next month, rented the flat for a couple of years before the landlord offered it for sale. Freud bought it for her for \u00a375,000, \u201cwhich seemed such an incredible lot of money at the time\u201d. It has not changed much in all the time since. There are bare boards on the floor; she points out an old leak in one corner of the ceiling. The studio is empty except for her easel and piles of discarded paint tubes and rags and a mirror, from which Paul constructs her haunting and soulful self-portraits. The only furniture in the adjoining living room is a battered chaise longue and a chair that is smeared, like much else, with paint. There is a single iron-framed bed in one corner. Paul, whose father was the bishop of Bradford, is married to Steven Kupfer, a teacher of philosophy, but they have always kept separate homes. What faith she has herself, she expresses on canvas. She is not, she admits to me with an apologetic giggle quite early in our conversation, a great lover of conversation. She has struggled her whole life with the terrors of small talk. Her self-containment, her vivid and protected world of interiors, is what gives her painting its enormous affective power. Paul describes herself as an autobiographer rather than a portrait painter by which she means she paints mostly herself and those she loves \u2013 her four sisters, her late mother, her husband, her son. Each of those singular figures emerge in her work as if from a private netherworld of thoughtful and anxious attention. For a while the family lived near Haworth, and the Bront\u00ebs have been touchstones for all of the sisters. They have each lost count of the number of times they have read Jane Eyre. Something of the ghost of that association animates a poetic, sometimes painfully honest memoir that Paul has written, which is the occasion for our interview. Before we sit down to talk she shows me the new paintings that she plans to include in an imminent exhibition of her work at the Victoria Miro gallery in London, which will open at the same time as her book appears. Paul has lately been granted her due as a soft-spoken star of British figurative art, \u201can artist like no other\u201d according to the New Yorker. She hoists her new canvases, which have their backs to the room, one by one to her easel, while offering a commentary about how vulnerable it feels to show work in this way. The paintings each infuse the room with curious light, and put a pin in the map of Paul\u2019s life. First up is a meditative seascape that she painted on a recent foray out to Los Angeles for an exhibition of her work. \u201cI dreaded going because I never go anywhere\u2026\u201d she says, \u201cbut the ocean proved inspiring.\u201d The light and the vegetation stirred memories of her very early childhood in India, where her father worked as a missionary. \u201cAnd that made me wonder about my dread of going away\u2026\u201d Is the dread about the travel, the flying? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind flying but I suffer from homesickness terribly. I can\u2019t stop thinking about getting back to my space here.\u201d That space is then occupied with an ethereal picture of her younger sister Kate, a writer and former actress, who became her most frequent sitter after their mother, at 80, was unable any longer to negotiate the stairs. In her book, Kate emerges as Paul\u2019s first confidante and soulmate, the sounding board for the fears and excitements of her involvement with Freud, whom she met, aged 18 when she was his student at the Slade School of Fine Art. Freud was then 55. They became lovers almost immediately, maintained a relationship for nearly a decade and a complicated intimacy that lasted until Freud\u2019s death in 2011. The relationship has led to Paul being routinely identified as another entry in Freud\u2019s extensive catalogue of lovers and subjects \u2013 she sat for several portraits \u2013 rather than as a formidable artist herself. She sees her book, and her self-portraits, as hard-won acts of liberation and defiance at that characterisation. \u201cWhen Lucian died I was shocked by how I was seen in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cI was \u2018Lucian Freud\u2019s muse\u2019. I felt I needed to do something about this. I thought the way to do that would be to make this story my own.\u201d She shows me another portrait, this one of her husband, Steven Kupfer, a tender painting that wants to bristle with its subject\u2019s quickness of mind. She pauses before it. \u201cSteven is very ill,\u201d she says. \u201cThough he does not look it. He has had bowel cancer and now he has liver cancer. I painted this in May. He is having chemo still and tests for which we always hold our breath. Psychologically he is very strong, reading madly, thinking about the transcendental ego. His morale is tremendously good.\u201d When Paul smiles, she becomes a different person, suddenly girlish. \u201cHe used to think about philosophy when he sat for me,\u201d she says, \u201cbut he often used to fall asleep. So now he memorises cryptic crossword clues before he comes and solves them in his head.\u201d Kupfer, 78, lives in Kentish Town, a couple of miles north from here. I wonder how their marriage works \u2013 was it never their plan to live together? She says that from the beginning \u2013 they married in 2011 \u2013 she made it clear that she needed this private space and he was OK with that. \u201cHe had lived with people before, but he took to the idea. We go out to supper with each other several times a week,\u201d she says, \u201cand he rings me punctually every day at 3pm and at 9pm. He is clockwork reliable. Compared to Lucian [who would keep her waiting long hours and days and weeks for promised contact], \u201chaving that support is extraordinarily confidence giving.\u201d Her memoir begins pointedly with the moment she met Freud \u2013 he in a perfectly tailored grey wool suit, with a white silk scarf, smoking a Gitane \u2013 on one of her first days at art college, fresh from her girls\u2019 boarding school in Devon. The first half of what follows mines her old diaries and letters and poems to reconstruct the love and longing and frequent despair that the affair caused her. Some scenes are hard to read \u2013 Paul\u2019s account of Freud\u2019s initial forceful physical advances; his insistence that she lie naked for him to paint, imposing an acute vulnerability that made her cry; the one-sided demands and frequent betrayals \u2013 and the more so because they are rendered in her original youthful voice. Her story emerges from those beginnings, however, to tell a different tale, one that celebrates family and persistent female power. In Freud\u2019s last painting of Paul, she stands fully clothed in this studio, her foot on a tube of paint, with a naked male model, her friend Angus Cook, sprawled on the chaise. Freud seemed to be marking a change in her, a suggestion that she was ready to transition from passive muse to active artist. She is not sure she needed his permission. Her own work subsequently dwelt on just those tensions. Her best-known self-portrait, Painter and Model (2012), was a large-scale intensely layered depiction of herself sitting in a painting smock; the painting was a scene stealer in the 2016 Tate Britain survey of post-war British painting, All Too Human, alongside the headline acts, Freud and Francis Bacon. The last two new paintings she shows me in her studio, are both new images of herself, now tentatively standing. \u201cWhen I first started doing self-portraits \u2013 and I didn\u2019t start until I was in my 40s, quite late \u2013 I did these portraits where my hand was kind of stretched out toward the canvas, as if about to paint,\u201d she says. \u201cI suppose I was imitating those famous poses of Goya or Rembrandt. But something felt so false about that. Somehow women don\u2019t have a secure place in the history of art and to portray myself in this way standing squarely, about to paint, it wasn\u2019t right.\u201d The new paintings have been inspired in part by the connection she felt to Paula Rego\u2019s recent exhibition, Obedience and Defiance. She laughs. \u201cI think I\u2019m finally ready to stand up from my chair,\u201d she says. She stands back from a version of herself on the easel. \u201cI called it Self-Portrait Standing. This is a kinder one of me than some, I think.\u201d We both stare at the unforgiving, hollow-eyed portrait and I suggest it could be kinder still. \u201cDo you think? This one started as a very much more cruel image. So what I did, there is this painting by Frans Hals, a beautiful painting of a gorgeous young woman I saw, and I did a sketch of it and put it on the easel so that she would look kindly on me while I was doing it.\u201d If Celia Paul had to escape from domineering male presences in her life, she also had to find a role for herself among her sisters (one of whom, Jane, is married to the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams). A portrait she made of the four sisters after her mother died in 2015, My Sisters Mourning seemed to capture something of the form of the famous painting of the Bront\u00eb sisters, by their brother Branwell. She suggests the reference was conscious. \u201cI also did a portrait of Patrick Bront\u00eb [the novelists\u2019 father] and then one of my own father,\u201d she says. \u201cWho died when I was 23. I had been thinking about absent fathers, which I guess is not far from thinking about God.\u201d Has religion been important to her? \u201cFrom the earliest memory every day started with prayer and ended with prayer,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it is still in my bloodstream, even though I am not conventionally religious. I am not good at belonging to groups. But doesn\u2019t everyone think about God?\u201d That tendency, her memoir suggests, was one reason Lucian Freud was drawn to her, and one of her own means of keeping herself apart. \u201cI think what Lucian was most disturbed by,\u201d she says, \u201cwas my kind of stillness. He had no truck with God. He found that difficult to deal with.\u201d And determined to disrupt? \u201cYes absolutely. He found it disturbing even if I looked dreamily out of a window. He wanted me firmly in the world.\u201d Freud encouraged her to think of their relationship like that between the youthful Gwen John and the ageing Auguste Rodin. John gave up painting for a time, \u201cto give herself up to this experience of being in love\u201d with the old master. Early in their affair, Freud encouraged Paul to do the same. Could she see the attraction of that? \u201cI think I might have been attracted to it if I hadn\u2019t known something of Lucian\u2019s past history,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was another of his girlfriends, Susie Boyt, who had also been at the Slade 25 years before me and had had five children, four with Lucian. She had stopped painting. Lucian and Susie went on being very close, and Lucian admired her tremendously, but I had the feeling that Lucian might have said something similar to her once in regard to Gwen John and Rodin. \u201cFor myself, I think Rodin and Lucian were in quite a profound way very different. Some of the greatest things Rodin did were watercolours of naked women. I felt he had a real empathy with women, as separate to himself, and I feel with Lucian there was always this element of control.\u201d Looking back, now she is at Freud\u2019s own age while they were together, does the relationship feel more uncomfortable than it did at the time? \u201cIt does, though when I was at the Slade several of the students were having affairs with tutors. The fact that Lucian said to me subsequently that he only came to the Slade to pick up a girl, didn\u2019t at the time seem shocking to me, or to anyone there. Whereas now to me it does seem shocking. I had approached him in the life room wanting to show him my drawings, because we both had drawn and painted our mothers. I had felt that affinity. But really that wasn\u2019t why he was drawn to me and that felt hurtful at the time.\u201d The relationship with Freud was her first experience with men, she says, which, as her diaries make clear, made it harder to comprehend. \u201cI had been at a girls\u2019 boarding school,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t interested in boys or men, I was interested in art. I was shocked by Lucian pouncing on me. But part of me thought: \u2018Maybe this is what happens.\u2019 I talked to my mother about it. And my mother said to me: \u2018Well, maybe you are in love with him.\u2019 And I thought to myself: \u2018Well, maybe I am.\u2019 Somehow her saying that seemed almost to give permission for all of it.\u201d Though Freud had numerous children \u2013 there are 14 acknowledged sons and daughters but maybe 30 others \u2013 he professed to have no interest in babies. He maintained close relationships with his grown-up offspring \u2013 including Frank Paul \u2013 but could never have been confused for a hands-on father. Freud began perhaps his most loving portrait of Paul, Girl in a Striped Nightshirt between 1983 and 1985, during which time she became pregnant and gave birth to Frank. \u201cHe was very caring while I was pregnant, we were very close during that time,\u201d Paul recalls. \u201cBut after, he was very pleased that I was going to ask my mother to help look after Frank. He expected me to come and be available as I had been, but obviously my life became more complicated.\u201d In 1985 when Freud made the portrait of Paul standing, and he bought this flat, they \u201cwere drifting apart in all sorts of ways,\u201d Paul says. \u201cWhen I first met Lucian he wasn\u2019t that famous. He was notorious, but he did not have a big international reputation or anything. He was a genuinely Dostoevskian character it seemed to me, living much more on the edge. And then later he became more a national treasure and was quite seduced by that.\u201d When did she last see Freud? \u201cI saw him actually on the day he died,\u201d she says. \u201cI saw him quite regularly at that time. A few weeks before he died I gave him a bath, and he always used to love having his back washed, and I washed his back with a sponge. He was much more gentle then and, of course, he wanted to regale me with stories about being friends with Princess Margaret and all that.\u201d Though she tried several times, Paul never completed a painting of Freud. \u201cI had a mattress on the floor of my studio and he would lie down on that and curl up,\u201d she says. \u201cI got quite far with one painting and then I just thought this isn\u2019t what I want to do and so gradually I stopped.\u201d She once made a pencil drawing of Freud asleep that she liked, but painted over it with a sketch of a kneeling penitent. Later she says, in another context: \u201cIt is quite telling of portraiture that love shines through. It is one of the reasons I know I can\u2019t paint people I don\u2019t love. If it works, it is only in a staged way.\u201d While we talk about this past there is the constant, distant noise from the street below from tourists and school parties visiting the museum. Paul seems suitably raised above that cacophony here. The contrast of stillness is perfect for her, she suggests, though occasionally busking bagpipers below drive her mad. She imagines that in the future she may move away from London in search of greater peace \u2013 perhaps to the Preseli hills in west Wales where she spends holidays \u2013 but it is hard to imagine her apart from this studio. \u201cI think I\u2019m a braver person, less anxious than I was,\u201d she says. \u201cMy son is completely independent now. So I am freer than I\u2019ve ever been before.\u201d I ask about the rhythm of her days. She rises early, at five or six, depending on the light, she says. \u201cI have a cup of tea in bed when I look out at the sky. I know a lot of painters boast about working 14 hours a day. But that\u2019s not me. My things tend to come in great bursts. So sometimes I work long hours and then sometimes not many hours at all.\u201d You would hesitate to describe Paul as a confident person, but she is possessed of a quietly cheerful certainty in her powers of persistence. She feels finally, she says, that she might be granted her own space apart from the alpha males of British painting. \u201cOne of the phrases I really don\u2019t like is \u2018in her own right\u2019,\u201d she says, as in: \u201cCelia Paul is also a painter in her own right.\u201d Her voice rises slightly in the stillness of the studio. \u201cI want there to be no question that I am a painter in my own right. I feel that my painting belongs to a whole tradition of British art. I can see connections between my work and Stanley Spencer, and Gwen John and Frank Auerbach. And that is the main way I am connected to Lucian,\u201d she says, firmly, \u201cas part of that spirit of British painting.\u201d \u2022 Celia Paul\u2019s memoir, Self-Portrait, is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a320).

      "body": "<p>Off-grid experiences are harder to come by these days, but if you\u2019re looking for something that will imprint itself on to your soul and make your heart quicken, Malawi is your destination. I first visited in 2011, and was gripped by an inexplicable love for the African continent and a deep sense of freedom, so returning now I was excited to see if I\u2019d feel the same. A lesser-known land in south-east Africa, Malawi borders Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia. It\u2019s a comparatively small, land-locked country, beguiling because of its sea-like lake. It is rightly known as the Warm Heart of Africa.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t prepared for quite how changeable its landscape would be. For the first 10 days of my holiday I am on an organised group excursion. It\u2019s curated by Faraway, a company specialising in diligently planned group escapes. Signing up to be part of a rabble of 16 people of similar age to me but from different walks of life and parts of the world and all looking to go on a fantastic trip, felt a bit like being on a more intrepid 18-30s holiday. But Faraway is a lot classier \u2013 and livelier. With regular offerings of the infamous Malawian gin replacing Sambuca shots, it\u2019s adventure travel for the Instagram generation. Group leaders Helen and Al present us with tote bags containing a \u201csurvival kit\u201d that includes some lightweight cotton trousers (vital for the long coach journeys) and a black and white disposable camera.</p> <p>There\u2019s a special type of camaraderie that comes from travelling together in a big van and having an itinerary. In times where more people are single and looking for a temporary escape from the pressures of everyday life, Faraway\u2019s Malawian trip is perfect. There\u2019s something for everyone, from trekking in luscious countryside, lakeside sun-kissed afternoons and rugged island camping to high-end safaris and raving at a festival with sand beneath our feet. The experience, from the outset, is a perfect mixture of giddy, brave, backpacking hysteria and once-in-a-lifetime, breathtaking, memorable moments. Staying somewhere new every other night as part of a team adds to the bonding experience, and I quickly make friends with Gid, an Australian tech developer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"821ec3a7281dd8ecafa77b02f828399eb3f559f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/821ec3a7281dd8ecafa77b02f828399eb3f559f0/0_209_3400_2040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Making music: a happy festival-goer at the Lake of Stars, near Mangochi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Making music \u2026 a happy festival-goer at the Lake of Stars, near Mangochi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve McInerny/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We spend our first night getting into the group dynamic at a mid-budget lakeside spot called Mgoza Lodge, which consists of simple huts and a very welcome communal \u201cdipping pool\u201d in a shaded garden. The lodge is chill and the food is delicious. It\u2019s also where we are introduced to Malawi\u2019s gin for the first time, which is pretty lethal, and proves a heady mix with anti-malaria tablet side-effects.</p> <p>In the morning we amble into the heart of Cape Maclear, the backpacker\u2019s village that is home to Mgoza Lodge. It has a welcoming, hazy, hippy vibe and a must-visit small shop filled with beautiful handwoven placemats and other locally made homeware. The profits go directly to the makers, a group of skilled local women.</p> <p>Next, we take a boat to Domwe and Mumbo, two remote islands in Lake Malawi\u2019s National Park, though you can also kayak there from Cape Maclear. Domwe is the more rugged of the two islands and offers simple tent accommodation and, in the evening, a big fire and a chance to kick back after watching a sunset that is so potent it sets your dreams alight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bfd3473b6c225e0fd4839e7e7b98c9ecbf90406e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfd3473b6c225e0fd4839e7e7b98c9ecbf90406e/0_133_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We watch the sunrise from our beds.

There\u2019s no phone signal and limited electricity so our night on Domwe has the air of wild romance. The following morning we head to Mumbo, my favourite of the two islands, which we have all to ourselves. Our accommodation is an upgrade from tents to bamboo cabins up in the hills, overlooking a jaw-dropping turquoise waterscape. In the morning we wake and watch the sunrise from our beds. Lost for words, all we can manage is: \u201cThis is incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Next, we go trekking. If you like to hike, then Zomba is a must. We stay at the cosy Zomba Forest Lodge, where they serve delicious home-cooked food made from locally grown ingredients. It\u2019s run by Tom and Petal, who can organise a day\u2019s hike that makes you feel like one of the dinosaurs in <em>The Land Before Time</em>. Zomba is under two hours from Blantyre airport and around four hours from the capital, Lilongwe.</p> <p>Then it is time to party, so we head to the Lake of Stars, the international music festival whose hotel base borders Lake Malawi. If you are a swashbuckling explorer in search of the unexpected, then Lake of Stars is a dream. The gloriously patchwork-style programme is a mixture of cultural offerings, with new favourites always on offer from the African diaspora. My own favourites are Malawian rapper Lady Pace and Kenya\u2019s Sauti Sol (the Kenyan equivalent to Take That and one of the biggest pop bands on the planet). I even DJ in a sand storm. It\u2019s worth booking your trip around the festival, though best to stay off-site, and prepare to have the most fun at sunset. If you\u2019re travelling in November, then you might also like to catch the annual <a href=\"http://faceook.com/tumainifestival\" title=\"\">Tumaini music and arts festival</a>, which always takes place in a refugee camp. This year\u2019s venue is Malawi\u2019s Dzaka Refugee Camp in Lilongwe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fad28752600920e8562d0aaff9888db5acfd0f3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad28752600920e8562d0aaff9888db5acfd0f3d/0_837_1536_921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All tied up: Gemma Cairney and friend have their hair braided in Cape Maclear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All tied up \u2026 Gemma Cairney and friend have their hair braided in Cape Maclear</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the end of the trip we go on safari. We are travelling down a dusty road in the Majete Reserve when we suddenly meet with an elephant so huge that Charles, our driver, stops \u2013 for a full 20 minutes. He is stunned, not knowing whether our rickety van might agitate the creature. The park itself is \u201cself-drive\u201d though you can also can go on a walking safari (too terrifying) or a boat safari to watch groups of yawning hippos up close. From our vehicle I spot skulking crocs and, that night, during the most majestic moment of all, we go out in a buggy in the dark of night, pull up at a viewing platform and spot a black rhino taking a long glug from a puddle.

      "bodyText": "Off-grid experiences are harder to come by these days, but if you\u2019re looking for something that will imprint itself on to your soul and make your heart quicken, Malawi is your destination. I first visited in 2011, and was gripped by an inexplicable love for the African continent and a deep sense of freedom, so returning now I was excited to see if I\u2019d feel the same. A lesser-known land in south-east Africa, Malawi borders Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia. It\u2019s a comparatively small, land-locked country, beguiling because of its sea-like lake. It is rightly known as the Warm Heart of Africa. I wasn\u2019t prepared for quite how changeable its landscape would be. For the first 10 days of my holiday I am on an organised group excursion. It\u2019s curated by Faraway, a company specialising in diligently planned group escapes. Signing up to be part of a rabble of 16 people of similar age to me but from different walks of life and parts of the world and all looking to go on a fantastic trip, felt a bit like being on a more intrepid 18-30s holiday. But Faraway is a lot classier \u2013 and livelier. With regular offerings of the infamous Malawian gin replacing Sambuca shots, it\u2019s adventure travel for the Instagram generation. Group leaders Helen and Al present us with tote bags containing a \u201csurvival kit\u201d that includes some lightweight cotton trousers (vital for the long coach journeys) and a black and white disposable camera. There\u2019s a special type of camaraderie that comes from travelling together in a big van and having an itinerary. In times where more people are single and looking for a temporary escape from the pressures of everyday life, Faraway\u2019s Malawian trip is perfect. There\u2019s something for everyone, from trekking in luscious countryside, lakeside sun-kissed afternoons and rugged island camping to high-end safaris and raving at a festival with sand beneath our feet. The experience, from the outset, is a perfect mixture of giddy, brave, backpacking hysteria and once-in-a-lifetime, breathtaking, memorable moments. Staying somewhere new every other night as part of a team adds to the bonding experience, and I quickly make friends with Gid, an Australian tech developer. We spend our first night getting into the group dynamic at a mid-budget lakeside spot called Mgoza Lodge, which consists of simple huts and a very welcome communal \u201cdipping pool\u201d in a shaded garden. The lodge is chill and the food is delicious. It\u2019s also where we are introduced to Malawi\u2019s gin for the first time, which is pretty lethal, and proves a heady mix with anti-malaria tablet side-effects. In the morning we amble into the heart of Cape Maclear, the backpacker\u2019s village that is home to Mgoza Lodge. It has a welcoming, hazy, hippy vibe and a must-visit small shop filled with beautiful handwoven placemats and other locally made homeware. The profits go directly to the makers, a group of skilled local women. Next, we take a boat to Domwe and Mumbo, two remote islands in Lake Malawi\u2019s National Park, though you can also kayak there from Cape Maclear. Domwe is the more rugged of the two islands and offers simple tent accommodation and, in the evening, a big fire and a chance to kick back after watching a sunset that is so potent it sets your dreams alight. We eat fresh fish that I had bought earlier in the day from a visiting fisherman. There\u2019s no phone signal and limited electricity so our night on Domwe has the air of wild romance. The following morning we head to Mumbo, my favourite of the two islands, which we have all to ourselves. Our accommodation is an upgrade from tents to bamboo cabins up in the hills, overlooking a jaw-dropping turquoise waterscape. In the morning we wake and watch the sunrise from our beds. Lost for words, all we can manage is: \u201cThis is incredible.\u201d Next, we go trekking. If you like to hike, then Zomba is a must. We stay at the cosy Zomba Forest Lodge, where they serve delicious home-cooked food made from locally grown ingredients. It\u2019s run by Tom and Petal, who can organise a day\u2019s hike that makes you feel like one of the dinosaurs in The Land Before Time. Zomba is under two hours from Blantyre airport and around four hours from the capital, Lilongwe. Then it is time to party, so we head to the Lake of Stars, the international music festival whose hotel base borders Lake Malawi. If you are a swashbuckling explorer in search of the unexpected, then Lake of Stars is a dream. The gloriously patchwork-style programme is a mixture of cultural offerings, with new favourites always on offer from the African diaspora. My own favourites are Malawian rapper Lady Pace and Kenya\u2019s Sauti Sol (the Kenyan equivalent to Take That and one of the biggest pop bands on the planet). I even DJ in a sand storm. It\u2019s worth booking your trip around the festival, though best to stay off-site, and prepare to have the most fun at sunset. If you\u2019re travelling in November, then you might also like to catch the annual Tumaini music and arts festival, which always takes place in a refugee camp. This year\u2019s venue is Malawi\u2019s Dzaka Refugee Camp in Lilongwe. At the end of the trip we go on safari. We are travelling down a dusty road in the Majete Reserve when we suddenly meet with an elephant so huge that Charles, our driver, stops \u2013 for a full 20 minutes. He is stunned, not knowing whether our rickety van might agitate the creature. The park itself is \u201cself-drive\u201d though you can also can go on a walking safari (too terrifying) or a boat safari to watch groups of yawning hippos up close. From our vehicle I spot skulking crocs and, that night, during the most majestic moment of all, we go out in a buggy in the dark of night, pull up at a viewing platform and spot a black rhino taking a long glug from a puddle. I freeze, awe-struck. Mkulumadzi Lodge is all-inclusive and our plush bedrooms have big holes instead of windows. It feels like you\u2019re sleeping in the wilderness, albeit under the highest thread count sheets. I extend my stay and took some deep decompression breaths at Latitude 13, a swish hotel in the former Japanese ambassador\u2019s residence 10 minutes from the centre of Llingowe.

      "bodyText": "A match that contained more kicks out of hand than it did minutes was appropriately decided by the boot when Handr\u00e9 Pollard\u2019s late penalty took South Africa to their third final and a repeat of 2007 when they defeated England in Paris in a match that had no more oxygen than the latest of Wales\u2019s World Cup hard-luck stories. Wales lost in the 2011 to France by a point after missing a late kick, were thwarted by a late South Africa try in the quarter-final four years ago and here looked to have taken the initiative after levelling the scores with a smart try from a scrum 16 minutes from time. However injuries ultimately caught up with them in an edgy encounter which had far more spills than thrills, and they tellingly lacked the Springboks\u2019 resources on the bench. The England head coach Eddie Jones was among the spectators and he will have had a feeling of deja vu as he watched South Africa adopt a rigid gameplan from the start based on taking no risks in their own half but kicking the ball to Wales and daring them to break down a defence that was as aggressive as it was unyielding. It was how South Africa won the World Cup 12 years ago when Jones was on their management team as a consultant. He said before the start of that tournament that the winners would have the best defence and he knows what to expect in Saturday\u2019s final. There was a period here before Wales scored their try that, briefly, gave them hope when they took play through 20 phases five metres from the Springboks\u2019 line. They were no closer to it at the end than they had been at the beginning, knocked back time and again. Wales tried to widen the point of attack, but South Africa so enveloped the ball-carriers that possession was slowed down and they were forced to use targets from one out, unable to make ground. It was the theme from the start when South Africa kicked the first eight times they received the ball and while Wales looked to play around the fringes, occasionally getting joy on the blindside, most of their attacks came from behind the gainline until they reached the point where they too had to kick. They did so more than South Africa, 41-40, but they had 61% of the possession. South Africa only passed the ball 67 times, with a hefty percentage of those coming in the move that led to their try on 56 minutes when Pollard indulged in one of his side\u2019s two offloads before jinking past the prop Rhys Carr\u00e9. South Africa used a penalty advantage to drive at Wales before moving the ball left where Damien de Allende, who was used mainly to batter his way through from set-pieces in Wales\u2019s half, fended off Dan Biggar before taking two defenders over the line with him. Otherwise South Africa were rigidly disciplined in keeping Wales at arm\u2019s length by not giving them mistakes to feed off in dangerous positions. Their only forward who covered any ground was the No 8 Duane Vermeulen, and most of the metres he ran were from restarts. South Africa made almost twice as many tackles as Wales and after taking the lead with the first of Pollard\u2019s four penalties 14 minutes in, they never fell behind. Wales drew level three times and a team that has in the last couple of years been able to find ways of winning tight matches in the final quarter rocked the Springboks 16 minutes from time when they opted for a scrum after being awarded a penalty and, even though it was going backwards, fashioned a try for the wing Josh Adams, his sixth of the tournament. The Springboks, for the first time, looked vulnerable. They brought their turnover specialist Francois Louw off the bench and his first contribution was to concede a penalty. Wales, who had lost the prop Tomas Francis and the wing George North to injuries in the first-half, sensed their opportunity one week after they had come from behind to topple France in the final minutes.

      "body": "<p>After an early, stop-start beginning, autumn is well under way. It is arguably the finest and most exciting season for the cook: when the showstoppers, ripened or fattened by mellow sun and lazy summer days, hit the shelves. At work, whole fungi, game and pumpkins take turns glowing in the embers of the wood oven, while close by the celebratory first white truffles are being shaved over taglierini, pizza and sometimes salads.</p> <p>At home our weekly vegetable box keeps us locked into the season. It is heartening, too, to see more unusual seasonal products, such as cobnuts, on supermarket shelves. My recipes reflect how we eat as a family and our longing for dishes with backbone, something to sustain and support us as the long nights draw in.</p> <p>The beetroots and shallots are dressed with a piquant but fortifying old-fashioned sauce that plays to the vegetables\u2019 sweetness. Contrastingly, bitter leaves, such as radicchio, raise the bar in the salad stakes. I can\u2019t resist their ruby leaves and love how their flavour offsets the aniseed flavour of fennel and cuts through the fattiness of the salty bacon. I have used the heart of the celery, one of my favourite ingredients, to add extra crunch. Then there is a variation of a parmigiana that I first made by accident. Everyone loves aubergine parmigiana, unctuous, rich and melting. Here, I\u2019ve steamed mushrooms to allow their heady character to shine through in the bake with special effect.</p> <p>If it\u2019s autumn, there has to be pudding, at our house anyway. The fig and walnut recipe is intended to satisfy fans of steamed puddings, but it is so easy to make it\u2019s almost cheating. The fruit rises to the top in marbled, jammy splodges. We ate it just above room temperature without cream or yogurt, but could have had either, or both. It\u2019s autumn. And indulgence starts here.</p> <h2>Baked apple and radicchio salad</h2> <p>The ultimate autumn salad and a meal in a bowl. <em>Serves 4</em></p> <p><strong>crisp apples, such as Cox </strong>2 <br><strong>good bacon or pancetta lardons </strong>200g <br><strong>fennel seeds </strong>a pinch<br><strong>wine </strong>1 glass<br><strong>parsley </strong>a small bunch<br><strong>round radicchio </strong>\u00bd <br><strong>inner celery heart </strong>1 <br><strong>fennel</strong> 1 bulb<strong> </strong><br><strong>lemon </strong>1<br><strong>horseradish </strong>2 tbsp, grated <br><strong>olive oil</strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Cut the apples into segments and core them. Fry the bacon/pancetta over a medium heat in a heavy pan that will go in the oven. When a bit crispy round the edges add the fennel seeds followed by the apples and wine. Move to the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes. Allow them to cool a little before assembling.</p> <p>Pick and wash the parsley, wash the radicchio, tearing the leaves as you go. Slice the celery heart and fennel.</p> <p>Squeeze the lemon over the horseradish and loosen with a little olive oil. Season the leaves and vegetables with a little salt and pepper in a salad bowl before adding everything else and tossing further.</p> <h2>Beetroot and caper sauce</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efe148d715dff2f99945d8a5646d255e666c09e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efe148d715dff2f99945d8a5646d255e666c09e7/0_414_6192_7740/800.jpg\" alt=\"An old-fashioned preparation: beetroot and caper sauce.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An old-fashioned preparation: beetroot and caper sauce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An old-fashioned preparation for beetroots with a sauce thickened with a touch of flour. A meat stock will add an extra dimension if you have it but reserved vegetable cooking water would be equally good. <em>Serves 4</em></p> <p><strong>beetroots </strong>500g, scrubbed<br><strong>garlic </strong>3 cloves <br><strong>shallots </strong>200g, peeled <br><strong>celery </strong>\u00bd head <br><strong>thyme </strong>2 sprigs<strong>,</strong> picked<br><strong>olive oil </strong><br><strong>butter </strong>40g <br><strong>small salted capers </strong>2 tbsp <br><strong>rosemary </strong>1 sprig, picked<br><strong>fine flour </strong>\u00bdtbsp<br><strong>wine vinegar </strong>2 tbsp<br><strong>broth or water </strong>100ml</p> <p>Heat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5. Lay two foil sheets side by side with a square of baking paper on top of each. In the centre of one place the trimmed and well-cleaned beetroots and one of the garlic cloves, on the other the shallots, celery heart cut into pieces roughly the same length as the shallots, and another garlic. Season both well, sprinkle with the thyme leaves and drizzle with oil.</p> <p>Fold and crunch up each to make two enclosed parcels. Bake on a tray, with the folds facing up so that no liquid escapes, until soft when pricked with a knife.</p> <p>Be cautious when opening the packages to check, so you are not burnt by the steam within. They will both take about an hour depending on the size and freshness of the beetroots.</p> <p>Slice the beets and arrange on a warm plate with the other vegetables before making the sauce. Melt the butter in your smallest pan over a medium heat with the last garlic sliced in two. When foaming well, add the capers and rosemary leaves and fry for half a minute before adding the flour. Stir continuously over a lowered heat for 3 minutes, then add the vinegar and broth or water in quick succession, stirring quickly all the while to avoid lumps. Continue to cook for 5 minutes and pour the smooth sauce over the vegetables. Season with plenty of freshly cracked black pepper.</p> <h2>Celeriac, porcini, potato and mozzarella</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9847573dbc7b6fa6d7c4409d5f1086de300c4be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9847573dbc7b6fa6d7c4409d5f1086de300c4be/0_328_6192_7740/800.jpg\" alt=\"This would be good with many types of fungi: celeriac, porcini, potato and mozzarella.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This would be good with many types of fungi: celeriac, porcini, potato and mozzarella.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was going to make this with fresh porcini, but when I went to my local deli, they were \u00a399.50/kg so I stuck to dried porcini and shiitake.

Soak the dried porcini in hot water for 20 minutes and then cut the fresh and dried mushrooms into \u00bd cm slices. Chop the garlic and pick the thyme. Dress the mushrooms with most of the thyme, the garlic, a little olive oil, salt and pepper.</p> <p>Peel and slice the celeriac and celery as thinly as you can. Thinly slice the potatoes as well, you don\u2019t have to peel them \u2013 just scrub. Toss them together with salt, pepper and olive oil. Drizzle a high-sided cooking dish/dishes with olive oil and embark on a first layer interspersed with potatoes, celeriac and celery. Cover with a layer of mushrooms and a third of the mozzarella slices. Finely sprinkle with parmesan before adding another celeriac and potatoes layer and repeat the process. Continue until everything is used, finishing with mozzarella, parmesan, 3 tbsp of water and a sprinkle of the remaining thyme leaves.</p> <p>Loosely cover with foil or paper and bake for 45 minutes, removing the foil cover for the last 10 minutes so that the top is bubbling and golden.</p> <h2>Fig and walnut pudding</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62a86e88fdc77bf63dcb16642d0b38937e0f9c42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62a86e88fdc77bf63dcb16642d0b38937e0f9c42/0_258_6192_7740/800.jpg\" alt=\"Especially good with rye bread: fig and walnut pudding.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Especially good with rye bread: fig and walnut pudding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I especially like this with rye bread. There\u2019s no need for any salt with this recipe as the bread will already have it. The method is quite crude, but the result is special.

Heat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3.</p> <p>Blitz the bread and milk in a food processor. Add the sugar and honey and mix more. In a small pan, melt the butter and then turn down the heat and cook until light brown and nutty. Pour into the mixer, too, followed by the eggs. Mix.</p> <p>Tear off a large sheet of baking paper that will comfortably fit inside a suitable baking dish. A tip is to screw the paper up first so that it holds its shape better. Pour the batter in, stir in the walnuts and evenly scatter over the figs.</p> <p>Bake for 45 minutes.

Serves 4 beetroots 500g, scrubbed garlic 3 cloves shallots 200g, peeled celery \u00bd head thyme 2 sprigs, picked olive oil butter 40g small salted capers 2 tbsp rosemary 1 sprig, picked fine flour \u00bdtbsp wine vinegar 2 tbsp broth or water 100ml Heat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5. Lay two foil sheets side by side with a square of baking paper on top of each. In the centre of one place the trimmed and well-cleaned beetroots and one of the garlic cloves, on the other the shallots, celery heart cut into pieces roughly the same length as the shallots, and another garlic. Season both well, sprinkle with the thyme leaves and drizzle with oil. Fold and crunch up each to make two enclosed parcels. Bake on a tray, with the folds facing up so that no liquid escapes, until soft when pricked with a knife. Be cautious when opening the packages to check, so you are not burnt by the steam within. They will both take about an hour depending on the size and freshness of the beetroots. Slice the beets and arrange on a warm plate with the other vegetables before making the sauce. Melt the butter in your smallest pan over a medium heat with the last garlic sliced in two. When foaming well, add the capers and rosemary leaves and fry for half a minute before adding the flour. Stir continuously over a lowered heat for 3 minutes, then add the vinegar and broth or water in quick succession, stirring quickly all the while to avoid lumps. Continue to cook for 5 minutes and pour the smooth sauce over the vegetables. Season with plenty of freshly cracked black pepper. Celeriac, porcini, potato and mozzarella I was going to make this with fresh porcini, but when I went to my local deli, they were \u00a399.50/kg so I stuck to dried porcini and shiitake. Nice in a couple of big dishes or individual ones, this is more of a main than a side and would be good with many other types of edible fungi. Serves 4 as a main dried porcini 15g shiitake or fresh porcini 300g garlic 2 cloves, chopped thyme 8 sprigs extra virgin olive oil celeriac 250g celery with leaves 2 sticks potatoes 250g mozzarella 250g, sliced parmesan 50g, grated Heat the oven to 170C/gas mark 3. Soak the dried porcini in hot water for 20 minutes and then cut the fresh and dried mushrooms into \u00bd cm slices. Chop the garlic and pick the thyme. Dress the mushrooms with most of the thyme, the garlic, a little olive oil, salt and pepper. Peel and slice the celeriac and celery as thinly as you can. Thinly slice the potatoes as well, you don\u2019t have to peel them \u2013 just scrub. Toss them together with salt, pepper and olive oil. Drizzle a high-sided cooking dish/dishes with olive oil and embark on a first layer interspersed with potatoes, celeriac and celery. Cover with a layer of mushrooms and a third of the mozzarella slices. Finely sprinkle with parmesan before adding another celeriac and potatoes layer and repeat the process. Continue until everything is used, finishing with mozzarella, parmesan, 3 tbsp of water and a sprinkle of the remaining thyme leaves. Loosely cover with foil or paper and bake for 45 minutes, removing the foil cover for the last 10 minutes so that the top is bubbling and golden. Fig and walnut pudding I especially like this with rye bread. There\u2019s no need for any salt with this recipe as the bread will already have it. The method is quite crude, but the result is special. I am told it is good cold for breakfast, too, but I was up last so didn\u2019t get to try. bread 200g, thickest crust removed milk 400ml golden caster sugar 120g honey 30g butter 30g eggs 4 shelled walnuts 100g figs 300g (4 large), each fig segmented into 8ths Soak bread in the milk for at least half an hour until totally soft. Heat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3. Blitz the bread and milk in a food processor. Add the sugar and honey and mix more. In a small pan, melt the butter and then turn down the heat and cook until light brown and nutty. Pour into the mixer, too, followed by the eggs. Mix. Tear off a large sheet of baking paper that will comfortably fit inside a suitable baking dish. A tip is to screw the paper up first so that it holds its shape better. Pour the batter in, stir in the walnuts and evenly scatter over the figs. Bake for 45 minutes. Serve hot with cold pouring cream and whisky if desired.

      "body": "<p>In early 2018 Italian-born photographer Nicol\u00f3 Lanfranchi was living in Berlin combining reportage work with commercial projects. He travelled the world for German media, producing stark images of the slow death of Brazilian rivers and the dignity of survivors of the Haiti earthquake.</p> <p>But he began watching with growing horror as a crisis unfolded closer to home. In his native Italy he could see an increasingly rightwing government cracking down on the rescue ships that patrolled the Mediterranean, particularly off the coast of Libya, threatening fines of tens of thousands of euros for bringing ashore people who were risking their lives trying to reach Europe in flimsy boats. By June, when the country\u2019s hardline interior minister Matteo Salvini began closing Italy\u2019s ports to the rescue ships, 45,000 migrants had already crossed the Mediterranean that year, with more than 1,000 deaths. Salvini\u2019s crackdown worked. Ships began to vanish, until there was only one left: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/07/dark-day-migrant-rescue-ship-aquarius-ends-operations-mediterranean\" title=\"\">the Aquarius</a>, run by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e.</p> <p>\u201cI was following this debacle from abroad,\u201d says Lanfranchi. \u201cIt was really painful to see how these rescue crews were being criminalised by my own government.\u201d</p> <p>Lanfranchi wanted to know more about the endemic brutality and violence in Libya that was making people take to the sea in desperation as their only way out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6134d1e31f1b2dc040a3d2dd0a2d41a6dbb45bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6134d1e31f1b2dc040a3d2dd0a2d41a6dbb45bb/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo\u00eblle and her husband Narcisse, both from Ivory Coast, playing chequers on Aquarius\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo\u00eblle and her husband Narcisse, both from Ivory Coast, playing chequers on Aquarius.

While my husband was searching for me a man sold me into prostitution.\u2019</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cI thought that my work as a storyteller could play a part in telling people the truth about what was happening. I was in contact with MSF trying to find out how many people were dying at sea. Then one day they called me and said: \u2018Next week we are leaving Marseille. Do you want to be with us?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lanfranchi agreed and a week later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/14/aquarius-onboard-the-migrant-rescue-ship-photographic-diary-1\" title=\"\">found himself on board Aquarius</a> as the ship rescued two boatloads of people. Some were refugees who had arrived in north Africa after escaping war in Eritrea, others were economic migrants from places such as Ivory Coast, fleeing the Libyan violence.</p> <p>Once everyone was on board and given water, there was a palpable sense of release, Lanfranchi says. \u201cI looked for people as they sat quietly, I asked if I could talk to them. There was one man who stood out to me, Augustine \u2013 people were drawn to him like a magnet.</p> <p>\u201cHe told me, \u2018Today, August 10th, is my birthday\u2019,\u201d Lanfranchi continues. \u201cAs soon as he walked away from me people started singing, playing music, dancing. You can see in the photos, they were also celebrating their joy at being rescued. For them it was the first step to a better life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ba2b8126424089f8ad73cb6ab6a465e992843dc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba2b8126424089f8ad73cb6ab6a465e992843dc5/0_0_5046_3364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boat full of migrants being rescued by the Aquarius\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rescue on the Med.

The sun was direct on their heads and there was such a silence.\u2019</p></li> </ul> <p>But over the next five days the Aquarius drifted, refused entry by governments and local authorities across the southern Mediterranean. Finally on 15 August the boat was given instructions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/14/aquarius-migrant-rescue-ship-to-be-allowed-dock-in-malta\" title=\"\">to proceed to the Maltese port of Valletta</a> where the migrants were taken on a police bus to detention. It was from Malta that arrangements were made through United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and European governments to send small groups to villages and towns around Europe. Places were offered after local campaigns asking mayors and councils to show solidarity with the migrants</p> <p>Lanfranchi was now desperate to know how he could follow the stories of those he had met, friends he had made. \u201cNone of them had phones but I found people on Facebook. It took months. Slowly we created a network, I asked where are you now? And I was told, \u2018I\u2019m in France, my friend is in Luxembourg.\u2019 I was determined to find out what happened next.\u201d</p> <p>What happens next for refugees who make it across the Mediterranean alive is a burning question throughout Europe. Italy and Malta want asylum seekers to be automatically relocated across Europe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/23/eu-nations-come-to-italys-aid-over-relocating-migrants\" title=\"\">so that the \u201cburden\u201d is shared</a>. </p> <p>The EU promises that \u201casylum must not be a lottery\u201d, stating that member states must \u201cwelcome asylum seekers in a dignified manner, ensuring that \u2026. no matter where an applicant applies, the outcome will be similar\u201d.</p> <p>Lanfranchi was intent on discovering if the system was fair. If everyone he met would get the same treatment, wherever they ended up. And so he set off across Europe to find out.</p> <h2>Vesoul, France</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f8ac5f052ed41301487a2cda2379be177543821\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f8ac5f052ed41301487a2cda2379be177543821/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigerian refugee Augustine in France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Augustine in France.

I miss my family, I hunger for Nigeria.\u2019</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cI decided to start with Vesoul,\u201d says Lanfranchi. \u201cThis is where Augustine was living and he is such a bright, connected guy. He was resettled with Mercy, his girlfriend. They were living in the same building as another couple from the boat, Jo\u00eblle and her husband Narcisse. Both women are pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>Vesoul, 350km south-west of Paris, is a neat and quiet town where the arrivals were placed on a housing estate at the edge of town overlooking the fields.</p> <p>Augustine and his friends are delighted with where they have ended up. Their apartments are spotless, they have been offered French lessons and they have social workers to help them assimilate.</p> <p>Augustine is keen to give as much to his new home, France, as possible. \u201cMuch was expected of me at home as the oldest son, but the situation was not secure in Nigeria. I studied science at school but here I want to be realistic about what kind of job I can do. I need to improve my French and find work.\u201d</p> <p>Jo\u00eblle is transformed. She had escaped months of brutal violence in Libya and can be seen on the boat with cropped hair and a haunted expression. Now she has long curling hair and a healthy baby bump. She smiles as she recalls the Aquarius appearing on the horizon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b57d884e2c928fb996d0ab1e4488e6f48284af8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b57d884e2c928fb996d0ab1e4488e6f48284af8/0_0_3695_4926/750.jpg\" alt=\"Mercy Iboyi, 26, from Nigeria, in Vesoul, France\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mercy Iboyi, 26, from Nigeria, in Vesoul, France.

We had given up waving at boats but the Aquarius came for us and we are always thankful to God for that. Coming to France wasn\u2019t a choice but I\u2019m very happy here.\u201d</p> <p>Lanfranchi was surprised to find his friends living in such a calm and welcoming environment. \u201cThey are really grateful. Yes there are migrants from many countries on this estate but there are also French people. I called it the peaceful ghetto. They are working and getting support.\u201d</p> <p>The local town has opened itself up to the group who arrived here. They have work training, support from social workers in looking for jobs, French lessons. Most of them now have five years leave to remain.</p> <p>Augustine hopes to become a nurse. He laughs often now. He originally left west Africa for economic reasons, but like Joelle he was seriously abused in Libya.</p> <p>Lanfranchi is relieved for them. \u201cAugustine was tortured in Libya, he was electrocuted. Now I can see him calming down, becoming a human being again. I was also so happy to see Joelle. I don\u2019t know if she has enough psychological support for what she went through but I think being pregnant together with Mercy, as friends, will be good for them.\u201d</p> <h2>Bielefeld, Germany</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f18eff40211712cf63fedb8f402dc21cf0292bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f18eff40211712cf63fedb8f402dc21cf0292bd/0_0_4345_2897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Aman, Amanuel and Aminadab with a friend from Eritrea, walking in Bielefeld, Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Aman, Amanuel and Aminadab with a friend from Eritrea, walking in Bielefeld, Germany.

In Germany no one bothers us about religion.\u2019</p></li> </ul> <p>After Vesoul, Lanfranchi visited Bielefeld in north-western Germany where the unaccompanied minors from the boat were sent. The boys, aged between 16 and 18, had suffered some of the hardest journeys, walking together from Eritrea, overland through Sudan to Libya, going days without water and food.</p> <p>The offer from the mayor of Bielefeld to resettle the boys from Malta came because of pressure from residents, who wanted to offer a new life to unaccompanied minors.</p> <p>The home is set up with shared rooms and a large kitchen they can use themselves. Above the iron-framed camp beds the boys have hung religious pictures. They like to spend time in the town skate park.</p> <p>The young people, who spent many months surviving without adults on their journey, find the rules of the centre difficult. Amanuel Yemane, 18, from Eritrea says: \u201cI like Germany but we have no privacy so I can\u2019t play my <em>krar</em> [Eritrean guitar].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b14da5cb95229ff4193526624d8e5c0a7ee001a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b14da5cb95229ff4193526624d8e5c0a7ee001a/0_363_5474_3286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amanuel Yemane, 18, from Eritrea, playing the krar in his room in home for unaccompanied minors in Bielefeld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amanuel Yemane, 18, from Eritrea, playing the krar in his room in home for unaccompanied minors in Bielefeld.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicol\u00f3 Lanfranchi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Amanuel Yemane, 18, from Eritrea, playing the krar in his room in home for unaccompanied minors in Bielefeld.</p></li> </ul> <p>But he is determined to make the most of his new life. \u201cI am transformed, I am a new person. I want to learn German and become an electrician. If it was not for the Aquarius I would be food for the fishes. I think all the time of my friends who are still suffering in Libya and Eritrea.\u201d</p> <p>But Lanfranchi fears that the teenagers\u2019 natural impatience with rules will lead to problems for them.</p> <p>He is most worried about one boy, Aminadab. \u201cHe has a girlfriend, he has drinks with a friend and maybe he stays out with friends or this girl. These things are very normal but they call the police on him.</p> <p>\u201cI took him aside at the end of my visit, and said I want to speak with you as a friend. I said: \u2018I am worried about you. You are very lucky, many people don\u2019t survive. Don\u2019t become what some people want to see, the immigrant guy doing bullshit. If you continue like this they will send you back to Eritrea and then you wasted the best years of your life for nothing.\u201d</p> <h2>Diekirch, Luxembourg</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"639773b6dbf5c85f12ba806876391b8c02006738\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/639773b6dbf5c85f12ba806876391b8c02006738/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benyam Yohanes, 25, from Eritrea, in front of the reception centre in Diekirch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benyam Yohanes, 25, from Eritrea, in front of the reception centre in Diekirch, Luxembourg.Lanfranchi says: \u2018I didn\u2019t remember these guys from the boat, but the boys in Germany told me I should visit them.

They are young adults, about 18 to 25.</p> <p>\u201cI was chatting with them online and they sent me pictures of the containers they are living in. They call it a detention centre, even though they can go out. They say, \u2018We are in a free prison\u2019. It\u2019s very far from the town, on a small mountain, 40 minutes\u2019 walk to a shop. They sign a paper every time they leave. They must be back at 10 o\u2019clock, or immediately the centre will inform the police.

      "bodyText": "In early 2018 Italian-born photographer Nicol\u00f3 Lanfranchi was living in Berlin combining reportage work with commercial projects. He travelled the world for German media, producing stark images of the slow death of Brazilian rivers and the dignity of survivors of the Haiti earthquake. But he began watching with growing horror as a crisis unfolded closer to home. In his native Italy he could see an increasingly rightwing government cracking down on the rescue ships that patrolled the Mediterranean, particularly off the coast of Libya, threatening fines of tens of thousands of euros for bringing ashore people who were risking their lives trying to reach Europe in flimsy boats. By June, when the country\u2019s hardline interior minister Matteo Salvini began closing Italy\u2019s ports to the rescue ships, 45,000 migrants had already crossed the Mediterranean that year, with more than 1,000 deaths. Salvini\u2019s crackdown worked. Ships began to vanish, until there was only one left: the Aquarius, run by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. \u201cI was following this debacle from abroad,\u201d says Lanfranchi. \u201cIt was really painful to see how these rescue crews were being criminalised by my own government.\u201d Lanfranchi wanted to know more about the endemic brutality and violence in Libya that was making people take to the sea in desperation as their only way out. Jo\u00eblle and her husband Narcisse, both from Ivory Coast, playing chequers on Aquarius. Jo\u00eblle says: \u2018I left Ivory Coast to work and ended up in Libya. On our first attempt to cross the sea we were caught and put in prison. The conditions were not human, people died every day. While my husband was searching for me a man sold me into prostitution.\u2019 \u201cI thought that my work as a storyteller could play a part in telling people the truth about what was happening. I was in contact with MSF trying to find out how many people were dying at sea. Then one day they called me and said: \u2018Next week we are leaving Marseille. Do you want to be with us?\u2019\u201d Lanfranchi agreed and a week later found himself on board Aquarius as the ship rescued two boatloads of people. Some were refugees who had arrived in north Africa after escaping war in Eritrea, others were economic migrants from places such as Ivory Coast, fleeing the Libyan violence. Once everyone was on board and given water, there was a palpable sense of release, Lanfranchi says. \u201cI looked for people as they sat quietly, I asked if I could talk to them. There was one man who stood out to me, Augustine \u2013 people were drawn to him like a magnet. \u201cHe told me, \u2018Today, August 10th, is my birthday\u2019,\u201d Lanfranchi continues. \u201cAs soon as he walked away from me people started singing, playing music, dancing. You can see in the photos, they were also celebrating their joy at being rescued. For them it was the first step to a better life.\u201d Rescue on the Med. Lanfranchi says: \u2018The Aquarius rescued two boats while I was on board.The first had around 25 people, most of them from West Africa. The second was bigger, around 120 people, including many unaccompanied minors from Eritrea. The motor of the boat had stopped working, it was really crowded.I remember the eye contact with them. They were exhausted. It was the hottest hour of the day. The sun was direct on their heads and there was such a silence.\u2019 But over the next five days the Aquarius drifted, refused entry by governments and local authorities across the southern Mediterranean. Finally on 15 August the boat was given instructions to proceed to the Maltese port of Valletta where the migrants were taken on a police bus to detention. It was from Malta that arrangements were made through United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and European governments to send small groups to villages and towns around Europe. Places were offered after local campaigns asking mayors and councils to show solidarity with the migrants Lanfranchi was now desperate to know how he could follow the stories of those he had met, friends he had made. \u201cNone of them had phones but I found people on Facebook. It took months. Slowly we created a network, I asked where are you now? And I was told, \u2018I\u2019m in France, my friend is in Luxembourg.\u2019 I was determined to find out what happened next.\u201d What happens next for refugees who make it across the Mediterranean alive is a burning question throughout Europe. Italy and Malta want asylum seekers to be automatically relocated across Europe so that the \u201cburden\u201d is shared. The EU promises that \u201casylum must not be a lottery\u201d, stating that member states must \u201cwelcome asylum seekers in a dignified manner, ensuring that \u2026. no matter where an applicant applies, the outcome will be similar\u201d. Lanfranchi was intent on discovering if the system was fair. If everyone he met would get the same treatment, wherever they ended up. And so he set off across Europe to find out. Vesoul, France Augustine in France. The Nigerian, 23, says: \u2018We had been three days at sea before the Aquarius found us. We had waved at so many boats. Then we saw it far away. That was the beginning of hope. When I got on board I knew life would never be the same again. My only sadness is that now I have protection in France I am not allowed to travel home. I miss my family, I hunger for Nigeria.\u2019 \u201cI decided to start with Vesoul,\u201d says Lanfranchi. \u201cThis is where Augustine was living and he is such a bright, connected guy. He was resettled with Mercy, his girlfriend. They were living in the same building as another couple from the boat, Jo\u00eblle and her husband Narcisse. Both women are pregnant.\u201d Vesoul, 350km south-west of Paris, is a neat and quiet town where the arrivals were placed on a housing estate at the edge of town overlooking the fields. Augustine and his friends are delighted with where they have ended up. Their apartments are spotless, they have been offered French lessons and they have social workers to help them assimilate. Augustine is keen to give as much to his new home, France, as possible. \u201cMuch was expected of me at home as the oldest son, but the situation was not secure in Nigeria. I studied science at school but here I want to be realistic about what kind of job I can do. I need to improve my French and find work.\u201d Jo\u00eblle is transformed. She had escaped months of brutal violence in Libya and can be seen on the boat with cropped hair and a haunted expression. Now she has long curling hair and a healthy baby bump. She smiles as she recalls the Aquarius appearing on the horizon. Mercy Iboyi, 26, from Nigeria, in Vesoul, France. Since the photo was taken, Mercy and her partner, Augustine, have had a baby boy, Emile. Mercy says: \u2018I am really happy because God almighty has done it again for me. I had a safe delivery, my son is doing great, we are just starting life here in France. By God\u2019s grace everything will be OK.\u2019 \u201cIt was God who sent that boat. We had given up waving at boats but the Aquarius came for us and we are always thankful to God for that. Coming to France wasn\u2019t a choice but I\u2019m very happy here.\u201d Lanfranchi was surprised to find his friends living in such a calm and welcoming environment. \u201cThey are really grateful. Yes there are migrants from many countries on this estate but there are also French people. I called it the peaceful ghetto. They are working and getting support.\u201d The local town has opened itself up to the group who arrived here. They have work training, support from social workers in looking for jobs, French lessons. Most of them now have five years leave to remain. Augustine hopes to become a nurse. He laughs often now. He originally left west Africa for economic reasons, but like Joelle he was seriously abused in Libya. Lanfranchi is relieved for them. \u201cAugustine was tortured in Libya, he was electrocuted. Now I can see him calming down, becoming a human being again. I was also so happy to see Joelle. I don\u2019t know if she has enough psychological support for what she went through but I think being pregnant together with Mercy, as friends, will be good for them.\u201d Bielefeld, Germany From left: Aman, Amanuel and Aminadab with a friend from Eritrea, walking in Bielefeld, Germany. Aminadab says: \u2018I left Eritrea because of my religious beliefs. In school I refused to take off my cross. I was imprisoned for six months. I want to stay here, get a job and live in peace. In Germany no one bothers us about religion.\u2019 After Vesoul, Lanfranchi visited Bielefeld in north-western Germany where the unaccompanied minors from the boat were sent. The boys, aged between 16 and 18, had suffered some of the hardest journeys, walking together from Eritrea, overland through Sudan to Libya, going days without water and food. The offer from the mayor of Bielefeld to resettle the boys from Malta came because of pressure from residents, who wanted to offer a new life to unaccompanied minors. The home is set up with shared rooms and a large kitchen they can use themselves. Above the iron-framed camp beds the boys have hung religious pictures. They like to spend time in the town skate park. The young people, who spent many months surviving without adults on their journey, find the rules of the centre difficult. Amanuel Yemane, 18, from Eritrea says: \u201cI like Germany but we have no privacy so I can\u2019t play my krar [Eritrean guitar].\u201d Amanuel Yemane, 18, from Eritrea, playing the krar in his room in home for unaccompanied minors in Bielefeld. But he is determined to make the most of his new life. \u201cI am transformed, I am a new person. I want to learn German and become an electrician. If it was not for the Aquarius I would be food for the fishes. I think all the time of my friends who are still suffering in Libya and Eritrea.\u201d But Lanfranchi fears that the teenagers\u2019 natural impatience with rules will lead to problems for them. He is most worried about one boy, Aminadab. \u201cHe has a girlfriend, he has drinks with a friend and maybe he stays out with friends or this girl. These things are very normal but they call the police on him. \u201cI took him aside at the end of my visit, and said I want to speak with you as a friend. I said: \u2018I am worried about you. You are very lucky, many people don\u2019t survive. Don\u2019t become what some people want to see, the immigrant guy doing bullshit. If you continue like this they will send you back to Eritrea and then you wasted the best years of your life for nothing.\u201d Diekirch, Luxembourg Benyam Yohanes, 25, from Eritrea, in front of the reception centre in Diekirch, Luxembourg.Lanfranchi says: \u2018I didn\u2019t remember these guys from the boat, but the boys in Germany told me I should visit them. They told me they were sad and frustrated. They sent me pictures of the centre and said, \u201cIt\u2019s really bad here, come and look at how we are living\u201d.\u2019 The final trip Lanfranchi took was to Luxembourg. \u201cThese weren\u2019t guys that I remembered from the boat,\u201d he says. \u201cI was put in touch with them by the boys in Germany. They are young adults, about 18 to 25. \u201cI was chatting with them online and they sent me pictures of the containers they are living in. They call it a detention centre, even though they can go out. They say, \u2018We are in a free prison\u2019. It\u2019s very far from the town, on a small mountain, 40 minutes\u2019 walk to a shop. They sign a paper every time they leave. They must be back at 10 o\u2019clock, or immediately the centre will inform the police. There are so many guards, there are cameras all around. \u201cThe town is diverse but they can\u2019t work without papers and even when they get them it\u2019s a very long process to get a decent job. And it\u2019s expensive to find a place to live.\u201d Lanfranchi sees some hope across Europe. \u201cI think there has been a resistance to the right. European leaders are talking about how to resolve and respond better to the migrant crisis and it is now easier to work at sea.\u201d But he also sees more than ever the brutal role of luck. \u201cIt\u2019s like a slot machine \u2013 you try and if you are lucky you win. Augustine was the luckiest guy of all to me. He survived torture, he got on the small wooden boat, was rescued. He found his girlfriend on the rescue boat \u2013 now they are living with their friends, they have money, they are safe, they have a home. Yet the men in Luxembourg have had a different experience.

The other night I launched the app and played a 30-minute video that involved me mimicking a series of jabs, hooks and squats. My wife appeared halfway through the workout and asked what I was doing. I was in the kitchen, punching the air with my fists. \u201cMMA: tap in!\u201d I said, over the voice of a trainer, sweet Jorge Blanco. She asked why. She had never seen me punch the air before, at least not in the kitchen, and, well, she was slack-jawed. I immediately thought, To be more Hemsworth! But I wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d understand, so I continued punching nothing in front of me and eventually she carried on with her evening. The routine lasted another 15 minutes. I was enjoying it. It felt good to punch the air. I am in the making, I suppose.",

But there are other kids on the block vying for your attention, too. Bakuchiol \u2013 the new Retinol \u2013 is known to even out skin tone, combat hyperpigmentation and smooth fine lines without the irritation normally associated with more hardcore alternatives. Many skincare products are formulated in a way that strips all the bacteria from our skin \u2013 which sounds like a good thing, but actually it\u2019s not. A layer of good bacteria permanently residing on our skin protects against premature ageing and skin ailments, such as eczema. Probiotic-led brands, such as <a href=\"https://www.aureliaskincare.com/\" title=\"\">Aurelia Probiotic Skincare</a> and <a href=\"https://motherdirt.com/\" title=\"\">Mother Dirt</a> \u2013 the only brand on the market with a patented live strain of good bacteria \u2013 will help restore the balance. In the UK, essences, somewhat confusingly also known as lotions, are still quite niche. In Asia, however, these concentrated liquids are a key part of daily skincare rituals. They are an easy way to drench skin in hydration while enabling all subsequent products to work even harder. My current favourites are from NYDG, Dior, Fresh and Cl\u00e9 de Peau. None are particularly cheap, but they do last a long time and the difference they make to your skin is nothing short of startling.</p> <h2>Doctor brands</h2> <p>You can trust doctors to deliver, right? Actually, not always. There are so many \u201cdoctor brands\u201d on the market, but here are the ones I know work. Murad is one of my favourites. It\u2019s incredibly inclusive (every skincare concern is covered) and their facials are among the best on the high street. <a href=\"https://drmaryamzamani.com/\" title=\"\">Dr Maryam Zamani</a> is a surgeon and aesthetic doctor at the respectable Cadogan Clinic. Her specialism is the eye \u2013 I\u2019m still on the fence about eye creams \u2013 but her line, particularly the Cleans and Clarify AHA Cleanser and Mask, is brilliant.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t a beauty editor who doesn\u2019t worship at the altar of <a href=\"https://drdennisgross.com/\" title=\"\">Dr Dennis Gross</a>. His cult product is Alpha Beta Peel pads. They will completely transform the texture of your skin. <a href=\"https://www.dr-barbara-sturm.com/\" title=\"\">Dr Barbara Sturm</a>, the German doctor behind the controversial vampire facial, has an eponymous line that also includes a range of products created specifically for darker skin tones. <a href=\"https://www.lancerskincare.com/meet-doctor-lancer\" title=\"\">Dr Lancer</a> is the dermatologist to the stars \u2013 the Kardashians, Victoria Beckham, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 and his Method: Polish is one of the few textured exfoliators I would recommend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e48564215b148e130d85c678281e3e3982f34b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e48564215b148e130d85c678281e3e3982f34b7/500_577_2672_1603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Prager\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The doctor will see you now: Dr Prager has a keen following among the A-list</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://drmichaelprager.com/\" title=\"\">Dr Michael Prager</a> \u2013 also beloved of the A-list and the fashion crowd \u2013 is one of Europe\u2019s most sought-after aestheticians. Usually he is the go-to for tweakments, but his superb Urban Protect range, chock full of antioxidants, focuses on protecting city dwellers from the effects of pollution.</p> <p><a href=\"https://drdavidjack.com/\" title=\"\">Dr Jack</a> is also a favourite of the fashion cognoscenti. His teeny but considered line features serums and a home peel that will give you clinic-level results. <a href=\"https://www.drsebagh.com/clinic\" title=\"\">Dr Sebagh</a> is known as the botox king, but I\u2019ve always been more interested in his Deep Exfoliating Mask. (It works wonders on uneven skin tones \u2013 there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s known as a pre-party facial in a pot \u2013 but it does tingle, so it\u2019s better for more hardy skin.) <a href=\"https://drsambunting.com/\" title=\"\">Dr Sam Bunting</a>\u2019s range is perfect for sensitive skin. Not only does her Flawless cleanser \u2013 a fragrance-free, non-foaming gel formula \u2013 actually clean, it is the antidote to the harsh, \u201cit gets worse before it gets better\u201d mantra, which too many doctor brands live by.</p> <h2>The beauty podcasts</h2> <p>My thinking on treatments such as fillers, botox and the like (aka tweakments), is that if you are having regular high-performance facials, following a good skincare regime and living a healthy (not necessarily perfect) lifestyle, you won\u2019t need to go down the route of injectables. If you are curious, however (because, after all, it is a free country), the very least you should do is arm yourself with the knowledge to make an informed choice. <a href=\"https://drmaryamzamani.com/podcasts/\" title=\"\">The Guinea Pig</a> podcast is an unfiltered insight into the latest aesthetic treatments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e239a7e7adc824211ed4f2b757b59f8158a1a4cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e239a7e7adc824211ed4f2b757b59f8158a1a4cd/85_101_1127_676/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Maryam Zamani leaning against a wall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Listen up: Dr Maryam Zamani is one of the presenters of the Guinea Pig podcast</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The presenters are Fiona Golfar \u2013 the former editor at large of British <em>Vogue</em> \u2013 and Dr Maryam Zamani, a surgeon and founder of cult beauty brand MZ Skin. Golfar is the resident guinea pig \u2013 trying and considering treatments (invasive and non-invasive) so you don\u2019t have to \u2013 while Zamani is the expert voice of reason. Everything is in layman\u2019s terms. It\u2019s honest, objective and, at times, very funny.</p> <p>Another podcast on the same subject comes from <a href=\"http://theeditorslist.buzzsprout.com/\">The Editor\u2019s List</a>. Founded by beauty journalist Olivia Falcon, it offers a guide to the world\u2019s best cosmetic surgeons, doctors and dermatologists. The podcast includes deep-dive conversations with some of the world\u2019s most prolific skincare and cosmetic surgery experts on everything from the social impact of injectable treatments to the future of botox. Even if you have no intention of having a face or a bum lift, it makes fascinating listening.</p> <h2>Haute couture beauty</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a686a6e10e2da06454a1be735a29d696f68d9042\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a686a6e10e2da06454a1be735a29d696f68d9042/1756_618_1079_2655/406.jpg\" alt=\"Augustinus Bader The Rich Cream 50ml jpeg\" width=\"406\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serious serum: Augustinus Bader\u2019s Rich Cream</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent years, I\u2019ve been slightly obsessed with high-low skincare. These are high-performance, low-priced beauty products by brands such as Beauty Pie, Deciem and Inkey, because I believe these days you don\u2019t always have to spend a fortune for good skin. I have, however, noticed a fascinating pendulum shift into something I call haute-couture beauty. These skincare products, generally with complex formulations, usually cost three-figure sums \u2013 the sort of purchases that make your lip quiver and your heart race as you get your credit card out. The impact on your skin is much more positive.</p> <p><a href=\"https://augustinusbader.com/uk/en/\" title=\"\">Augustin</a><a href=\"https://augustinusbader.com/uk/en/\" title=\"\">us Bader</a> is the stem cell scientist who has got the skincare world in a frenzy. His research into the skin-repair process of burns victims proved that stem-cell technology was beneficial to numerous skincare concerns, from acne to ageing. So he bottled it. His multi award-winning moisturisers have been touted as the only face creams worth spending money on.</p> <p>Japanese beauty brands are at the heart of this movement. Decort\u00e9, one of the best-selling and most prestigious skincare brands in Asia, has recently made its debut in the UK. The entire line is based on a combination of mind-boggling innovation and ancient eastern medicine. (Its exquisite hero product, Moisture Liposome Serum, is a hydrating dream and relatively affordable.) Their more prestigious launch, AQ Meliority, does feature creams with a price tag similar to that of a secondhand car.</p> <p>The arrival of Cl\u00e9 de Peau, another Japanese brand that has recently landed in the UK, was highly anticipated, such is its cult status. Recently I\u2019ve been using their Hydro Softening Lotion and, goodness me, the results are utterly phenomenal. As Japan is well known for its technological advances in skincare, other skincare brands look to the east. One of the key ingredients in the newly launched Tom Ford Research line is gyokuro. This highly concentrated green tea, known for its smoothing and antioxidant qualities, is found in each of Ford\u2019s luxurious face creams.</p> <p>The question is: \u201cHow much is too much to spend?\u201d Well, it depends on what it is; no one needs to spend three figures on a cleanser. Also, how unique is the formulation? Personally, I have found the rigorous research and exquisite formulas in Japanese beauty brands, such as Shiseido, manifest into the best skin I\u2019ve ever had.</p> <p>And, finally, what\u2019s your bank saying? Don\u2019t start a skincare regime you can\u2019t afford. </p> <h2>Cosmeceuticals</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e866ae7eb7f1c5e5a1779ae83f12285def6f7d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e866ae7eb7f1c5e5a1779ae83f12285def6f7d7/0_583_2753_1651/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctor knows best: part cosmetic. part pharmaceutical, the \u2018cosmeceutical\u2019 product brings medical rigour to the world of skincare\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctor knows best: part cosmetic, part pharmaceutical, the \u2018cosmeceutical\u2019 product brings medical rigour to the world of skincare</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A cosmeceutical is a skincare product that has medical properties. You find them in specialist retailers, clinics and medi spas. They are not sexy. But you won\u2019t care about that when you discover how high performance they are. One of my favourites is <a href=\"https://www.medik8.com/\" title=\"\">Medik8</a>. The cleansers \u2013 problem solvers that unclog pores, revive dull skin and boost hydration \u2013 are particularly excellent. As are those from pharmaceutical grade brand <a href=\"https://isclinical.com/\" title=\"\">iS Clinical</a>. Its Cleansing Complex is effective, but gentle, on acneic skin. <a href=\"https://www.skinceuticals.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Skin</a><a href=\"https://www.skinceuticals.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Ceuticals</a> is on every skincare aficionado\u2019s essential list. CE Ferulic is its best-selling antioxidant serum, which improves signs of photo-ageing, fine lines and lack of elasticity. It is small and pricey, but nothing compares to it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.neostrata.com/\" title=\"\">Neo</a><a href=\"https://www.neostrata.com/\" title=\"\">Strata</a> is something of a beauty pioneer \u2013 it started using AHAs more than 40 years ago. Try the potent Illuminating Serum \u2013 you\u2019ll see brighter skin in a week.</p> <p>Skincare emporiums There\u2019s no denying the impact of the digital age on how we now shop for beauty \u2013 it\u2019s so much easier and more convenient. (I wouldn\u2019t recommend online for foundations though \u2013 that rarely ends well.)

As someone who encourages everyone to use sun protection, this has been disconcerting. The issue revolves around ingredients \u2013 some such as oxybenzone have been found to be environmentally unfriendly. Then there\u2019s the case of Vitamin D. There is a global growth in Vitamin D deficiency that many argue is caused by wearing too much sunscreen. (This came as a surprise to me seeing as most people I know still don\u2019t wear sunscreen regularly.) Last year, 13 of the world\u2019s leading skin experts held a panel to dissect, discuss and debate the Vitamin D theory. They came to the conclusion that the daily wearing of sunscreens should not affect the level of Vitamin D in a healthy adult \u2013 sunscreen still allows the production of Vitamin D and the evidence still points to sunscreen being good for us. So, long story short, I\u2019d carry on wearing sunscreen, but keep it non-toxic. REN is one of the champions of clean beauty and this also applies to their sunscreen. For darker skin tones, however, <a href=\"https://coola.com/\" title=\"\">Coola</a> and <a href=\"https://www.soleiltoujours.com/\" title=\"\">Soleil Toujours</a> are more suitable as they don\u2019t leave an ashy tint.</p> <p>I don\u2019t expect this is the end of the saga, but what is beyond dispute is that sunscreen decreases the potential for hyperpigmentation and skin cancer.

Sometimes. There are many I wouldn\u2019t waste my money on. Like any crystal rollers. Yes, they claim to tone and define your face, but that requires a lot of elbow grease. Also the questionable ethics and origins behind most crystals are likely to weigh on your conscience. Instead, use a microcurrent device from <a href=\"https://www.mynuface.com/pages/microcurrent\" title=\"\">NuFace</a>. Not only does it improve facial contour without manual labour, it also boosts the production of collagen and elastin. An initial starting point, however, might be a cleansing device.

A <a href=\"https://www.foreo.com/\" title=\"\">Foreo</a> \u2013 a rubbery circular cleansing device \u2013 will not only up your face-washing game, but make your cleansers work a million times better.

Many grown-ups are still dealing with breakouts because their stress levels are high. High stress levels produce cortisol, which is bad news for skin. And so the divide between topical beauty and healthcare is beginning to be bridged. The most talked about ingredient in this area is CBD (cannabidiol). This is a compound derived from the cannabis plant (it\u2019s not the bit that gets you high) that is said to protect the skin from oxidative stress, relieve pain and anxiety, and is anti-inflammatory. There is still a lot of research that needs to be done to substantiate the claims, and with brands including the ingredient in everything from mascara to toothpaste, it is difficult to be 100% sold on it. <a href=\"https://disciplelondon.com/\" title=\"\">Disciple</a>, however, is one of the more authentic brands using CBD in its formulations. Their calming Miracle Drops \u2013 taken orally \u2013 are great for stress and anxiety. Stress control was also the thinking behind the launch of <a href=\"https://glowbarldn.com/\" title=\"\">Glow Bar</a>. Its infrared saunas \u2013 where you sit and sweat for up to 45 minutes \u2013 have been proven to release endorphins. This helps lower cortisol levels which, again, is great news for the skin. Urban Retreat is a newly open 12,000 sqft space in London dedicated to wellness and beauty. It houses a cleanse clinic (they do colonics) and the best international holistic and medical doctors, which keeps it from veering into New Age territory.</p> <h2>Skincare emporiums</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9a61e6b27a3a344672a99d58f11c6585afcb94e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9a61e6b27a3a344672a99d58f11c6585afcb94e/0_367_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Made for skintellectuals: the new Harrods Skincare Space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Made for skintellectuals: the new Harrods Skincare Space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harrods</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no denying the impact of the digital age on how we now shop for beauty \u2013 it\u2019s so much easier and more convenient.

      "bodyText": "The new vital ingredients Hyaluronic Acid and AHAs have become standard ingredients in most skincare regimes (do add them, they will plump and refine your skin no end). But there are other kids on the block vying for your attention, too. Bakuchiol \u2013 the new Retinol \u2013 is known to even out skin tone, combat hyperpigmentation and smooth fine lines without the irritation normally associated with more hardcore alternatives. Many skincare products are formulated in a way that strips all the bacteria from our skin \u2013 which sounds like a good thing, but actually it\u2019s not. A layer of good bacteria permanently residing on our skin protects against premature ageing and skin ailments, such as eczema. Probiotic-led brands, such as Aurelia Probiotic Skincare and Mother Dirt \u2013 the only brand on the market with a patented live strain of good bacteria \u2013 will help restore the balance. In the UK, essences, somewhat confusingly also known as lotions, are still quite niche. In Asia, however, these concentrated liquids are a key part of daily skincare rituals. They are an easy way to drench skin in hydration while enabling all subsequent products to work even harder. My current favourites are from NYDG, Dior, Fresh and Cl\u00e9 de Peau. None are particularly cheap, but they do last a long time and the difference they make to your skin is nothing short of startling. Doctor brands You can trust doctors to deliver, right? Actually, not always. There are so many \u201cdoctor brands\u201d on the market, but here are the ones I know work. Murad is one of my favourites. It\u2019s incredibly inclusive (every skincare concern is covered) and their facials are among the best on the high street. Dr Maryam Zamani is a surgeon and aesthetic doctor at the respectable Cadogan Clinic. Her specialism is the eye \u2013 I\u2019m still on the fence about eye creams \u2013 but her line, particularly the Cleans and Clarify AHA Cleanser and Mask, is brilliant. There isn\u2019t a beauty editor who doesn\u2019t worship at the altar of Dr Dennis Gross. His cult product is Alpha Beta Peel pads. They will completely transform the texture of your skin. Dr Barbara Sturm, the German doctor behind the controversial vampire facial, has an eponymous line that also includes a range of products created specifically for darker skin tones. Dr Lancer is the dermatologist to the stars \u2013 the Kardashians, Victoria Beckham, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 and his Method: Polish is one of the few textured exfoliators I would recommend. Dr Michael Prager \u2013 also beloved of the A-list and the fashion crowd \u2013 is one of Europe\u2019s most sought-after aestheticians. Usually he is the go-to for tweakments, but his superb Urban Protect range, chock full of antioxidants, focuses on protecting city dwellers from the effects of pollution. Dr Jack is also a favourite of the fashion cognoscenti. His teeny but considered line features serums and a home peel that will give you clinic-level results. Dr Sebagh is known as the botox king, but I\u2019ve always been more interested in his Deep Exfoliating Mask. (It works wonders on uneven skin tones \u2013 there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s known as a pre-party facial in a pot \u2013 but it does tingle, so it\u2019s better for more hardy skin.) Dr Sam Bunting\u2019s range is perfect for sensitive skin. Not only does her Flawless cleanser \u2013 a fragrance-free, non-foaming gel formula \u2013 actually clean, it is the antidote to the harsh, \u201cit gets worse before it gets better\u201d mantra, which too many doctor brands live by. The beauty podcasts My thinking on treatments such as fillers, botox and the like (aka tweakments), is that if you are having regular high-performance facials, following a good skincare regime and living a healthy (not necessarily perfect) lifestyle, you won\u2019t need to go down the route of injectables. If you are curious, however (because, after all, it is a free country), the very least you should do is arm yourself with the knowledge to make an informed choice. The Guinea Pig podcast is an unfiltered insight into the latest aesthetic treatments. The presenters are Fiona Golfar \u2013 the former editor at large of British Vogue \u2013 and Dr Maryam Zamani, a surgeon and founder of cult beauty brand MZ Skin. Golfar is the resident guinea pig \u2013 trying and considering treatments (invasive and non-invasive) so you don\u2019t have to \u2013 while Zamani is the expert voice of reason. Everything is in layman\u2019s terms. It\u2019s honest, objective and, at times, very funny. Another podcast on the same subject comes from The Editor\u2019s List. Founded by beauty journalist Olivia Falcon, it offers a guide to the world\u2019s best cosmetic surgeons, doctors and dermatologists. The podcast includes deep-dive conversations with some of the world\u2019s most prolific skincare and cosmetic surgery experts on everything from the social impact of injectable treatments to the future of botox. Even if you have no intention of having a face or a bum lift, it makes fascinating listening. Haute couture beauty In recent years, I\u2019ve been slightly obsessed with high-low skincare. These are high-performance, low-priced beauty products by brands such as Beauty Pie, Deciem and Inkey, because I believe these days you don\u2019t always have to spend a fortune for good skin. I have, however, noticed a fascinating pendulum shift into something I call haute-couture beauty. These skincare products, generally with complex formulations, usually cost three-figure sums \u2013 the sort of purchases that make your lip quiver and your heart race as you get your credit card out. The impact on your skin is much more positive. Augustinus Bader is the stem cell scientist who has got the skincare world in a frenzy. His research into the skin-repair process of burns victims proved that stem-cell technology was beneficial to numerous skincare concerns, from acne to ageing. So he bottled it. His multi award-winning moisturisers have been touted as the only face creams worth spending money on. Japanese beauty brands are at the heart of this movement. Decort\u00e9, one of the best-selling and most prestigious skincare brands in Asia, has recently made its debut in the UK. The entire line is based on a combination of mind-boggling innovation and ancient eastern medicine. (Its exquisite hero product, Moisture Liposome Serum, is a hydrating dream and relatively affordable.) Their more prestigious launch, AQ Meliority, does feature creams with a price tag similar to that of a secondhand car. The arrival of Cl\u00e9 de Peau, another Japanese brand that has recently landed in the UK, was highly anticipated, such is its cult status. Recently I\u2019ve been using their Hydro Softening Lotion and, goodness me, the results are utterly phenomenal. As Japan is well known for its technological advances in skincare, other skincare brands look to the east. One of the key ingredients in the newly launched Tom Ford Research line is gyokuro. This highly concentrated green tea, known for its smoothing and antioxidant qualities, is found in each of Ford\u2019s luxurious face creams. The question is: \u201cHow much is too much to spend?\u201d Well, it depends on what it is; no one needs to spend three figures on a cleanser. Also, how unique is the formulation? Personally, I have found the rigorous research and exquisite formulas in Japanese beauty brands, such as Shiseido, manifest into the best skin I\u2019ve ever had. And, finally, what\u2019s your bank saying? Don\u2019t start a skincare regime you can\u2019t afford. Cosmeceuticals A cosmeceutical is a skincare product that has medical properties. You find them in specialist retailers, clinics and medi spas. They are not sexy. But you won\u2019t care about that when you discover how high performance they are. One of my favourites is Medik8. The cleansers \u2013 problem solvers that unclog pores, revive dull skin and boost hydration \u2013 are particularly excellent. As are those from pharmaceutical grade brand iS Clinical. Its Cleansing Complex is effective, but gentle, on acneic skin. SkinCeuticals is on every skincare aficionado\u2019s essential list. CE Ferulic is its best-selling antioxidant serum, which improves signs of photo-ageing, fine lines and lack of elasticity. It is small and pricey, but nothing compares to it. NeoStrata is something of a beauty pioneer \u2013 it started using AHAs more than 40 years ago. Try the potent Illuminating Serum \u2013 you\u2019ll see brighter skin in a week. Skincare emporiums There\u2019s no denying the impact of the digital age on how we now shop for beauty \u2013 it\u2019s so much easier and more convenient. (I wouldn\u2019t recommend online for foundations though \u2013 that rarely ends well.) Nevertheless, retail spaces dedicated to skincare have become a thing because it turns out skintellectuals \u2013 consumers with a growing intelligence about skincare trends, ingredients and products \u2013 also like the tangibility of bricks and mortar. Knightsbridge beauty retailers have recently tapped into this. Harrods\u2019 newly opened skincare emporium is a paean to the epidermis. Clean/non-toxic, doctor-led Japanese beauty brands, as well as numerous facial treatments, are available here. Harvey Nichols has also expanded its skincare offering by launching the Light Salon\u2019s infra-red technology facials and Face Place, the facial brand beloved by Hollywood for its skilled extraction process (your pores have never been so clean). For those who find department stores anxiety-inducing, Space NK offers a glorious curation of niche and establishment brands \u2013 from La Mer to Drunk Elephant. You\u2019ll find branches dotted all over the country. If you prefer an even smaller space, try Omniya. It\u2019s so small you could almost be shopping in your living room. Almost. The good facialists Many people don\u2019t believe in facials. But you would if you found the right one, though claims to rejuvenate and refresh the skin (and all those other useless and ambiguous terms) are worthless. A great facial is rarely super-relaxing, but what would you prefer? Declogged, clear, glowing skin that looks incredible sans makeup \u2013 or having to tolerate whale music while someone faffs around with your face only to leave you looking exactly the same as you did when you walked in? A good facialist should deliver striking, immediate results. Jasmina Vico is always ahead of the game with technological advancements in treatments and skincare. She was using cryotherapy in her facials long before anyone knew what it was. Getting an appointment with the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s facialist, Sarah Chapman, might be a long shot, but you can try her (excellent) team at her eponymous clinic. The rooms are a little too bright and clinical for my liking, but the clarity of my skin \u2013 helped by the state-of-the-art gadgets, amazing facial massage and one of the best extracting processes I\u2019ve ever experienced \u2013 totally make up for it. Aesthetician Dija Ayodele is the founder of the Black Skin Directory. What she doesn\u2019t know about skin \u2013 black or otherwise \u2013 could fit on the tip of a needle. You only have to look at Dr Ewoma\u2019s skin to understand why she is called the \u201cSkn Doctor\u201d \u2013 it is startlingly luminous. Dr Barbara Kubicka\u2019s signature facial, deeply cleanses, plumps skin and improves circulation. And if you never believed in the power of a facial massage (gives incredible definition) visit Abigail James. By the end, you\u2019ll be a convert. The sunscreen question You may or may not be aware of the debate raging as to whether we should still be wearing sunscreen. As someone who encourages everyone to use sun protection, this has been disconcerting. The issue revolves around ingredients \u2013 some such as oxybenzone have been found to be environmentally unfriendly. Then there\u2019s the case of Vitamin D. There is a global growth in Vitamin D deficiency that many argue is caused by wearing too much sunscreen.

So, long story short, I\u2019d carry on wearing sunscreen, but keep it non-toxic. REN is one of the champions of clean beauty and this also applies to their sunscreen. For darker skin tones, however, Coola and Soleil Toujours are more suitable as they don\u2019t leave an ashy tint. I don\u2019t expect this is the end of the saga, but what is beyond dispute is that sunscreen decreases the potential for hyperpigmentation and skin cancer. For now, that\u2019s good enough for me. Facial devices Are facial tools worth spending your money on? Sometimes. There are many I wouldn\u2019t waste my money on. Like any crystal rollers. Yes, they claim to tone and define your face, but that requires a lot of elbow grease. Also the questionable ethics and origins behind most crystals are likely to weigh on your conscience.

And so the divide between topical beauty and healthcare is beginning to be bridged. The most talked about ingredient in this area is CBD (cannabidiol). This is a compound derived from the cannabis plant (it\u2019s not the bit that gets you high) that is said to protect the skin from oxidative stress, relieve pain and anxiety, and is anti-inflammatory. There is still a lot of research that needs to be done to substantiate the claims, and with brands including the ingredient in everything from mascara to toothpaste, it is difficult to be 100% sold on it. Disciple, however, is one of the more authentic brands using CBD in its formulations. Their calming Miracle Drops \u2013 taken orally \u2013 are great for stress and anxiety. Stress control was also the thinking behind the launch of Glow Bar. Its infrared saunas \u2013 where you sit and sweat for up to 45 minutes \u2013 have been proven to release endorphins. This helps lower cortisol levels which, again, is great news for the skin. Urban Retreat is a newly open 12,000 sqft space in London dedicated to wellness and beauty. It houses a cleanse clinic (they do colonics) and the best international holistic and medical doctors, which keeps it from veering into New Age territory. Skincare emporiums There\u2019s no denying the impact of the digital age on how we now shop for beauty \u2013 it\u2019s so much easier and more convenient. (I wouldn\u2019t recommend online for foundations though \u2013 that rarely ends well.) Nevertheless, retail spaces dedicated to skincare have become a thing because it turns out skintellectuals \u2013 consumers with a growing intelligence about skincare trends, ingredients and products \u2013 also like the tangibility of bricks and mortar. Knightsbridge beauty retailers have recently tapped into this. Harrods\u2019 newly opened skincare emporium is a paean to the epidermis. Clean/non-toxic, doctor-led Japanese beauty brands, as well as numerous facial treatments, are available here. Harvey Nichols has also expanded its skincare offering by launching the Light Salon\u2019s infra-red technology facials and Face Place, the facial brand beloved by Hollywood for its skilled extraction process (your pores have never been so clean). For those who find department stores anxiety-inducing, Space NK offers a glorious curation of niche and establishment brands \u2013 from La Mer to Drunk Elephant. You\u2019ll find branches dotted all over the country. If you prefer an even smaller space, try Omniya. It\u2019s so small you could almost be shopping in your living room. Almost.

For Western\u2019s new fans to the A-League, even a loss won\u2019t see them not come back for future derbies, such was the drama of the contest. And to think, next week they\u2019ve got Victory.</p> \n  <p>Melbourne City deserving winners for their industry and guile, even after going down to ten men. Eric Mombaerts called for a response after their shock FFA Cup loss midweek - he certainly got that. And thanks to Jamie Maclaren\u2019s double, the sky blues of Melbourne jump to second on the table. <br></p> \n  <p>Earlier, it was a comfortable three points for the reigning premiers Perth, away to Wellington. Not the quality on display from the hosts, but the irrepressible talent of Bruno Fornaroli and Diego Costa lighting up a cold, windy afternoon.</p> \n  <p>In Netball, good news for Australia\u2019s Diamonds, who earned a modicum of revenge against their trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand, courtesy a seven-point win. It won\u2019t salve all the hurt of losing the World Cup, but it will certainly help.</p> \n  <p>And big wins to the Australian men\u2019s cricket team, the Heat, Thunder and Strikers in the WBBL, on another jam-packed Sportwatch. </p> \n  <p>Thanks for your company, as always!</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-27T09:22:03.576Z\">at 9.22am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db55c3d8f08142786c514f9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-27T09:00:42.806Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Western United 1-2 Melbourne City</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And there\u2019s the whistle, and what a tale of redemption for the sky blue side of Melbourne! Thumped in the FFA Cup final midweek - more than worthy winners here today, but they had to do it the hard way after that big call to dismissal Harrison Delbridge. Jamie Maclaren the difference with a terrific brace - kudos Mombaerts, and credit City for chasing all three points.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34e075f98d2c85cb15acfc606ea78e3c68fc0b1d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34e075f98d2c85cb15acfc606ea78e3c68fc0b1d/0_0_3333_2222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A-League, Western United v Melbourne City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joshua Brillante and Ersan G\u00fcl\u00fcm go head to head.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Pockett/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-27T09:02:27.032Z\">at 9.02am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db55baf8f08993584c8bb70\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-27T08:58:14.670Z\">8.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>90 + 2 min: </strong>Western United bring out from the back, but they need to get moving.

Australia\u2019s Diamonds trail New Zealand\u2019s Silver Ferns 2-1 ahead of the final match in the series but the hosts will retain the cup on goal percentage if they can win at the RAC Arena. If Australia required any further motivation they have it in the announcement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/25/caitlin-thwaites-departs-prematurely-and-with-her-goes-diamonds-plan-b\">Caitlin Thwaites\u2019 retirement </a>and the occasion marking Caitlin Bassett\u2019s 100th international appearance.

We\u2019ll tune into those around <strong>2.30pm</strong>. </p> \n  <p>From <strong>4pm</strong> the <strong>A-League</strong> takes centre stage. We begin with the distance derby over in Wellington where the Phoenix welcome Perth Glory. Then from <strong>6pm</strong> Western United experience their first Melbourne derby against neighbours City. Richard Parkin will be in charge of the blog by then. </p> \n  <p>In amongst all that there\u2019s the <strong>MotoGP</strong> from Phillip Island, build-up to the Mexican <strong>F1 </strong>GP, <strong>Rugby World Cup</strong> news and reaction, and plenty more besides.</p> \n  <p>You can join in by contacting me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\">@JPHowcroft</a>, or by email: <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com</a>.

      "bodyText": "As first offerings go, Western United-Melbourne City was a contest to whet the appetite. For Western\u2019s new fans to the A-League, even a loss won\u2019t see them not come back for future derbies, such was the drama of the contest. And to think, next week they\u2019ve got Victory. Melbourne City deserving winners for their industry and guile, even after going down to ten men. Eric Mombaerts called for a response after their shock FFA Cup loss midweek - he certainly got that. And thanks to Jamie Maclaren\u2019s double, the sky blues of Melbourne jump to second on the table. Earlier, it was a comfortable three points for the reigning premiers Perth, away to Wellington. Not the quality on display from the hosts, but the irrepressible talent of Bruno Fornaroli and Diego Costa lighting up a cold, windy afternoon. In Netball, good news for Australia\u2019s Diamonds, who earned a modicum of revenge against their trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand, courtesy a seven-point win. It won\u2019t salve all the hurt of losing the World Cup, but it will certainly help. And big wins to the Australian men\u2019s cricket team, the Heat, Thunder and Strikers in the WBBL, on another jam-packed Sportwatch. Thanks for your company, as always! And there\u2019s the whistle, and what a tale of redemption for the sky blue side of Melbourne! Thumped in the FFA Cup final midweek - more than worthy winners here today, but they had to do it the hard way after that big call to dismissal Harrison Delbridge. Jamie Maclaren the difference with a terrific brace - kudos Mombaerts, and credit City for chasing all three points. 90 + 2 min: Western United bring out from the back, but they need to get moving. Pierias earns a freekick, and it\u2019s a pretty decent area, just to the left of the box. Diamanti stands over it - can he pick someone out? He does - it\u2019s Berisha - and it flies past the post! A stooping header, but it\u2019s just behind him. Imagine that. 90 min: Kone looks to release Appiah-Kubi, as the fourth official shows four minutes will be the added time. Now City have dropped a little deeper - let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t invite their rivals back in, having worked so hard to regain the lead. 87 min: What a finish we have in store now! Durante loops forward for Western United, as Mark Rudan\u2019s chargers contemplate their first ever loss, and in their first ever Melbourne derby to boot. Goal! Western United 1-2 Melbourne City (Maclaren) 84 min: Still a good spirit to this game, as Western United look to lift themselves. But it\u2019s something from nothing! A long aimless ball over the top from Brillante finds Maclaren - Kurto hesitates momentarily and doesn\u2019t come, and the Socceroos striker smashes it home first time. He\u2019d been bollocking teammates for a lack of service - you can\u2019t blame him when he\u2019s knocking home goals like that! 82 min: Maclaren one-on-one at the back with Gulum, who cynically pulls back the striker and earns a very deserved yellow card. Freekick for City - but it\u2019s poorly turned over. 81 min: Atkinson with a snap shot, but it\u2019s comfortable again from Kurto to save. It\u2019s still City bursting forward with intent, as Metcalfe\u2019s shot is blocked by some desperate last-line defence. 78 min: Brillante is penalised for a foul on Berisha. Another superb performance from the new City signing - he lost a tooth during the FFA Cup final midweek, but he appears to be showing no ill-effect with another all-action showing in the engine room. 75 min: Metcalfe with an opportunity, and he\u2019s copped a bollocking from Jamie Maclaren! He did appear to dally, and the cutback never found the striker. Could that have been 2-1 to City? To credit the ten-men team, they\u2019re still making a lot of the running. Some sides would be shutting up shop and looking for the safety of one point. 72 min: The youngster Atkinson now trots on to replace Genreau. He did brilliantly on his first full start under Mombaerts, the talented midfielder - who of course got the assist for Maclaren\u2019s opener. And at the other end of the age scale, it\u2019s Andrew Durante into the book for a professional foul to break up play. 68 min: So it\u2019s ten-men City now looking to hang on. Can Western United now go and snatch all three points? It could turn into a disastrous week for the Manchester-City-backed operation, from FFA Cup final disaster to potentially big points dropped in the league. Goal! Western United 1-1 Melbourne City (Berisha) 65 min: Berisha v Bouzanis (spicy) - and it\u2019s the veteran goal-getter who thumps it home, as the \u2018keeper goes the wrong way. And in the blink of an eyelid this game has come alive. Poor old Eric Mombaerts - his team were looking reasonably sound - now they\u2019re all at sea! 63 min: Here we go, here we go - Berisha goes to ground in the box, and Adam Kersey says penalty! And we pause for a VAR assessment - and Kersey has come back to hand Harrison Delbridge a second yellow card, and thus a red! The verdict is deliberate handball to deny a goalscoring opportunity - the big defender can\u2019t believe it! 60 min: It\u2019s Kone writhing and turning in the box - they\u2019re starting to come into this more and more, Western United, as City are in danger of dropping a little deeper. Oh my. It\u2019s McDonald who butchers a golden chance! He\u2019s sent through by Berisha, but he badly drags his shot wide. A horror finish from the vastly experienced former Socceroo! 56 min: Post! He only ever needs a sniff, and it\u2019s Besart Berisha who clatters Dean Bouzanis\u2019 post! That was a fiercely struck shot after a clever stop and swivel. Unfortunate for the all-time A-League topscorer. A fine effort. 52 min: Diamanti with another terrific ball, but it only just evades Pain. They\u2019ve been working a little harder after the break, Western United, let\u2019s see if it earns them dividends. 48 min: A fast release from Noone sents Wales on a scamper, but as per too often with the former Mariners, it comes to nought. Meanwhile, Delbridge goes in the book for a rudimentary block on Diamanti. It was breaking play too, so no argument really. A-League - second half! 45 min: And once more, unto the breach, as Western United look to step up the intensity a gear to match a finely-humming Melbourne City. And there is of course more Rugby World Cup semi-final action from Japan tonight - with Wales v South Africa just around the corner. Luke McLaughlin is our eyes on the prize for that one, don\u2019t miss a beat, here: And a nice write up from our NZ correspondent Eleanor Ainge Roy on how people have been coming to terms with the All Black\u2019s stunning exit. Well, and not well, is the quick precis around the country: Half-time: Western United 0-1 Melbourne City And there\u2019s the whistle. It\u2019s first blood to the visitors, as the new kids on the block fail to hit back late on. City worthy leaders, having created a swag of half-chances, but only Maclaren\u2019s sharp finish the difference. A fascinating 45 to come, you\u2019d imagine, as this one opens up. 45 min: Oh my - after 45 minutes more or less on the back foot, they\u2019re almost level, Western United! It\u2019s an excellent set piece delivery from Diamanti - he finds McDonald for a free header just metres out, but he heads into the ground and the pace comes off the ball, and a relieved Bouzanis tips over! Big opportunity spurned. 44 min: Ooh - it\u2019s another crucial interception from Kurto! Noone with a brilliant ball into the box, and the Pole throws himself at the feet of Wales to deny the youngster a fourth ever A-League goal. Superb keeping. 41 min: It\u2019s a half-chance for Western as McDonald and Kone look to combine inside the box, but the former\u2019s clever backheel doesn\u2019t quite find the Greek international. 37 min: It\u2019s an interesting conundrum for Mark Rudan - in his time with Phoenix last season there was criticism that his side could set up well to counterpunch, but struggled at times to chase a game when behind. Can his Western United charger show more purpose? 34 min: So, City finally land the knockout punch their general play has warranted - what can Western United muster now in response? Goal! Western United 0-1 Melbourne City (Maclaren) 31 min: And that\u2019s a fine effort from Genreau! It\u2019s again saved by Kurto, but that was arrowing for the bottom corner. And the youngster turns provider, with a clever ball in to Maclaren, but he still has a power of work to do. A brilliant turn and shot from the striker, he leaves a defender in his wake. A poweful finish, expertly taken by a striker in form. 29 min: So not exactly a lull, but an interesting patch to this contest. Both sides a little cagey, trying to carve chances without heavily overcommitting to attack. Noone now curls in a fires an effort, but it\u2019s again saved by Kurto. He\u2019s been by far the busier of the two \u2018keepers early on. 26 min: It\u2019s a tricky corner and Ersum Gulum pops up at the far stick, but it\u2019s blocked by a sea of sky blue bodies. Sorry, City blue. Berisha now looks to make a nuisance of himself, forcing Good into, well, a not good clearance. 23 min: A fine double cameo from Genreau who tracks back to help out his skipper, Jamieson, before expertly bringing down a tricky lofted ball. Can he become the latest A-League star to emerge off the City production line? Maclaren now looks to wriggle free inside the box, but Chapman sticks manfully to his job and prevents the shot. 20 min: It\u2019s all very narrow from Western United, before Diamanti tries one from long range. You\u2019d call it \u201cambitious\u201d but when you have his talent, why not? It draws a deflection and earns the corner. And it\u2019s a header on target from Berisha! But straight at the \u2018keeper Bouzanis. 18 min: Fine work from Kurto once again as he tips over a thumping drive from Griffiths! That\u2019s better from the veteran midfielder, who\u2019s looked a little rusty in the opening exchanges. 15 min: A first chance for Western United in attack, but it\u2019s Scott Galloway who prevents Besart Berisha from scoring an against-the-run-of-play opener! A clumsy challenge from Connor Pain then earns the ire of referee Adam Kersey. He follows Griffiths into the book. 12 min: Big chance! It was a sharp double save in the end from Kurto, but how did City not score there?! The Polish shot-stopper did well to intercept the first low ball across the face, it sat invitingly for either Wales or Genreau to lash home, but they both dallied, and the \u2018keeper pounced gratefully on the ball first. 9 min: Craig Noone with an early shot on target, but it\u2019s comfortably handled by Kurto in the Western United goal. It\u2019s City perhaps that have looked marginally brighter over the early exchanges, and here\u2019s Wales looking to burst down the left, but it comes to little. 7 min: The first of those already trademark raking cross-field switches from Alessandro Diamante. What a class player, and character he appears to be. We\u2019ve just seen the influence of Diego Castro in Wellington, can the veteran Italian prove the X-factor for this game? 4 min: A fair noise early on from the Western United active supporters. A tough ask building a club from scratch in a \u201cgrowth corridor\u201d, but great to see these fans taking passionately to their new club. And it\u2019s an early yellow card to the hugely experienced Rostyn Griffiths, for a series of fouls already. A-League Kick off! 1 min: And we\u2019re underway in the inaugural Western United-Melbourne City derby. What will this clash provide? Eep - and a final score from the T20 clash in Adelaide: Australia have won by 134 runs. Do not adjust your screens. Geoff Lemon with the latest there: To team news: It\u2019s an unchanged XI for Mark Rudan\u2019s hugely experienced Western United: One key change for City, as youngster Denis Genreau comes into the XI - no doubt there\u2019s a few tired bodies after their midweek FFA Cup final loss. But! To brighter A-League climes! We saw the magic of the Sydney derby yesterday - now for a new rivalry as new kids on the bloc Western United take on Melbourne City. It\u2019s the club without a stadium vs the club without a fanbase - who can land the first blow in the battle for Melbourne\u2019s non-Victory fans? Well, it was a cherry on an otherwise average pie. A service station cheesecake of a game, if you will. Phoenix with a little late consolation, but in truth, Perth never looked like losing that one after taking a 2-nil lead. A first win of the season for the Glory, but it\u2019s bottom of the ladder for the Phoenix - none from three, after two home games. Goal! Wellington Phoenix 1-2 Perth Glory (Davila) 90 + 3 min: Penalty! Hello, late drama! It\u2019s Hooper who\u2019s clattered into from behind by the fellow substitute, Djulbic. And it\u2019s Davila that steps up to take it.. and he drills it into the bottom right corner! 90 + 1 min: Four minutes added is the figure, but Perth will be more than happy to shuffle laterally and see this one out. A first glimpse of Hooper on the turn, but he can\u2019t fashion the opening, the storied sharpshooter. 89 min: A clock-slowing sub as the veteran Dino Djulbic comes on for Osama Malik. Piscopo earns a corner for the Phoenix, but they take it short and nothing comes of it. A frustrating watch for the Wellington faithful - the weather has been predictably abject, and the football from the home side, not much better. 86 min: It\u2019s an animated Tony Popovic on the sideline - his side have enjoyed 20% possession over the past ten minutes - but in truth the Phoenix haven\u2019t looked especially dangerous. Reddy almost gets caught by Hooper! My, he doesn\u2019t mind a risk with ball at feet, the veteran \u2018keeper. And now Ball pokes an effort wide! He went with the right boot, where was the left?! 83 min: Unselfish from Waine, who\u2019s sent through by Hooper - but the youngster looks for the return ball when surely the shot was the option! Davila does well to regain possession in midfield and he curls an effort goalwards on his non-preferred right foot - but it flies just high. 81 min: Ball fires a cross into the box, looking for Hooper, but it\u2019s well kept out by Perth. They\u2019re probing around the box, the Phoenix, but you\u2019d have to say - there\u2019s a lack of general quality about some of their buildup. 78 min: Castro and Kilkenny look to keep the ball in the corner, slowing the play, but it\u2019s eventually turned over. A break inn play as Juande stays down after a heavy coming-together with Louis Fenton. 75 min: And it is officially Hooper-time. The former Celtic and Norwich sharp shooter is stripped and prepped on the side line, awaiting his A-League debut. And the youngster Ben Waine comes on as well in an attacking double substitution for the Phoenix. What can this much-vaunted striker bring to this clash? 71 min: They\u2019re starting to drop very deep, Perth, and it invites the pressure from the home side. A rare foray upfield and it\u2019s Marinovic forced into a save. While at the other end it\u2019s the youngster Callum McCowatt who tests Reddy, who gets down well. 68 min: Big double chance! Alex Grant with a fine block to deny David Ball, before Liam Reddy gets behind a shot from the Mexican Ulises Davila. A great passage for Wellington - as the wind lifts, so does the intensity. A goal here and the contest could really come to life. Meanwhile Popovic subs on a former Phoenix player, Jacob Tratt, to steady his defence. WBBL: Thunder 123-8 lost to Heat 124-5 - Brisbane laboured to victory over Hobart, securing the 124th and winning run off the penultimate delivery of the match. Beth Mooney\u2019s patient unbeaten 44 and Amelia Kerr\u2019s more urgent unbeaten 28 proved decisive. All five Thunder bowlers took a wicket apiece. Earlier on some late hitting pushed Hobart to a defendable total at Allan Border Field. The Hurricanes were 90-7 at one point but England\u2019s Heather Knight steadied the ship with an unbeaten 61. Jess Jonassen once again starred with the ball, capturing 4-20. The win lifts the Heat to third on the ladder, level on points with the Hurricanes. 65 min: Castro now pops up near his own corner flag, evading the interest of two would-be tacklers. Piscopo fires in a terrific cross but Sotirio can\u2019t connect cleanly with the header. He get\u2019s a second chance off a subsequent ball, but under no pressure, he nods over! Big let off, Perth - a warning shot across the bows. 61 min: It\u2019s looking very comfortable for Perth with Diego Castro starting to pull almost Harlem-Globetrotter-esque moves. Age really hasn\u2019t slowed the mercurial Spaniard. What a jewel in the A-League he\u2019s been in recent years. Perth launch a fast counter, and it\u2019s Chris Ikonomidis who almost picks out a teammate with the cross, but Neil Kilkenny can\u2019t connect cleanly. 58 min: On comes Reno Piscopo for the Phoenix - this talented young Australian attacking midfielder. Can he spark something? Fornaroli tests Marinovic again with a well-worked shot from the edge of the box. Hasn\u2019t that been a battle today. A reminder that we\u2019ve cricket underway in Adelaide as well, where, well. It\u2019s not looking great for the visitors Sri Lanka. Halfway into their run chase they\u2019re 49-4. A reminder, they were set 234 off Australia\u2019s 20 overs. Yikes. WBBL: Stars 141-5 lost to Thunder 142-6 - Melbourne Stars remain winless after four rounds following defeat to Sydney Thunder. Chasing 142 for victory Thunder got over the line with just two balls to spare. Rachel Priest and Alex Blackwell both hit 45, the latter unbeaten at the crease when it mattered most to earn player of the match honours. For the Stars Madeline Penna took 4/20 but it was to no avail. Earlier, Elyse Villani and Lizelle Lee both struck 50s but the 39 balls faced by the other Stars yielded just two boundaries. All five Thunder bowlers each took one wicket. Thunder\u2019s three wins from four matches moves then joint-top of the WBBL ladder alongside Adelaide. 52 min: An early \u201cfinding out\u201d period in the second half, as Rufer goes in the book for a blatant tugback on Diego Castro. Phoenix then work into the box once more, but again it\u2019s more intricate and incisive. They need somebody to take the game by the scruff of the neck in the final third - too many in yellow looking for an extra pass rather than a shot. 48 min: It was a torrid first 45 for the former-Glory youngster Walter Scott, in his first A-League start, but Nix coach Talay has shown faith in the youngster. No doubt given him some calming words at half-time. A-League: Second half! 45 min: And we\u2019re back in windy Wellington - no sign yet of the Phoenix\u2019s big name signing who remains on the bench. Surely not long until Gary Hooper-time, especially if they\u2019re still trailing. Kia ora! A shoutout to our NZ-based readers who are no-doubt gripped to their phones scrolling for constant updates as to the inevitable Wellington Phoenix comeback (and in no ways about to slide into a double-funk, following yesterday\u2019s remarkable Rugby World Cup upset). Cheers JP - a gentleman and a blogger. There\u2019s plenty going on around Australasia today in sport - what\u2019s caught your eye? As always you can fire us an email or tweet to join the conversation. Right, that\u2019s it for me for the time being. The man on the keys from the next post onwards will be Richard Parkin. Thanks for your company. A-League: HT: Wellington 0-2 Perth - It\u2019s been even around the park but distinctly one-sided at the business end with Glory\u2019s attacking prowess in contrast to Phoenix\u2019s impotence. Perth have found the back of the net twice already but it could easily have been four or five. Marniovic made two superb saves and on the stroke of half-time it took a miraculous block from Fenton to deny Fornaroli his second. The Uruguayan has looked threatening up front but it\u2019s Castro who has pulled the strings on the left and Ikonomidis who has stretched the game on the right. That said, perhaps the main talking point of the half was the decision not to dismiss W\u00fcthrich for his grisly lunge from behind that received only a booking. Cricket: Meanwhile, over at Adelaide Oval, Australia are humiliating Sri Lanka. A-League: 38 mins: Wellington 0-2 Perth - Lovely interplay from Davila and McCowatt ends with the former dragging a left foot shot agonisingly wide of Liam Reddy\u2019s goal. McCowatt is influential in a subsequent attack that breaks down on the edge of Glory\u2019s box. Wellington have shown so much promise this season but their lack of cutting edge is hurting them time and again. The sooner Hooper is match-fit the better. A-League: GOAL! (Ikonomidis) 33 mins: Wellington 0-2 Perth - Whenever Glory have attacked they\u2019ve looked like creating chances and finally a second has gone in. Castro was once again the architect, biding his time before weighting a decisive pass behind the Phoenix defence. Franjic turned it into a better pass than a slower man may have, his cutback worked superbly by Fornaroli for Ikonomidis to drill home. Glory\u2019s season is up and running. A-League: 25 mins: Wellington 0-1 Perth - Yellow card to W\u00fcthrich of Perth following an awful challenge from behind on halfway. VAR has checked and they have agreed with the referee. You\u2019ve seen reds given for less, and you\u2019ve seen serious injuries suffered in more innocuous tackles. A-League: 22 mins: Wellington 0-1 Perth - Another thrilling save from Marinovic, pawing away a firm Fornaroli header that was travelling across his body. Despite Wellington\u2019s composure in general play they have conceded three gilt edged chances now. The quality of Castro, Ikonomidis and Fornaroli in Glory\u2019s forward line is coming to the fore. Cricket: Oh boy, it\u2019s all happening at Adelaide Oval. Glenn Maxwell has biffed an absurd 50, and David Warner has smacked a ton. Australia have finished their 20 overs on an eye-watering 233. A-League: 16 mins: Wellington 0-1 Perth - Superb save from Marinovic but it should be 2-0 to Perth. Good work down the right from Ikonomidis creates space in the box on the opposite flank for Kim but the South Korean placed his curled right-foot effort close enough to the diving keeper for him to tip the ball behind for a corner. Netball: Here\u2019s your Constellation Cup match report... A-League: GOAL! (Fornaroli) 11 mins: Wellington 0-1 Perth - Bruno Fornaroli has opened his account for Perth Glory. It was a very tidy dinked finish in traffic on the six-yard line but credit for the goal really has to go to Diego Castro who waltzed his way through the Nix defence down the left channel before squaring along the ground through a forest of legs to his Uruguayan teammate. A-League: 10 mins: Wellington 0-0 Perth - It\u2019s a nice open encounter in Wellington with both sides fashioning chances and attacking at pace. Castro saw an opening at one end before Ball\u2019s heavy touch denied him a decent shooting chance at the other. Needless to say there\u2019s plenty of wind wreaking havoc too. A-League: 5 mins: Wellington 0-0 Perth - We\u2019re underway at Westpac Stadium and it\u2019s the home side making all the early running, much as they did against Sydney FC last week. A-League: We\u2019ll soon be training our attention on the sarcastically named distance derby between Wellington and Perth. Neither side has set the league alight in the opening couple of rounds, Glory well below the standards they set on their way to the premiership last season, and Phoenix unlucky to lose both their fixtures so far, especially last time out against Sydney FC. Glory are bolstered by the return of Ivan Franjic at right wingback in a starting XI that boasts an intimidating frontline of Castro, Fornaroli and Ikonomidis. Ufuk Talay will be hoping for an immediate impact from star signing Gary Hooper who will makes his Nix debut today from the substitute\u2019s bench. WBBL: Thunder 123-8 v Heat (yet to bat) - Brisbane will be the happier of the two sides at the changeover despite some late hitting pushing Hobart to a defendable total at Allan Border Field. The Hurricanes were 90-7 at one point but England\u2019s Heather Knight steadied the ship with an unbeaten 61. Jess Jonassen once again starred with the ball, capturing 4-20. WBBL: Stars 141-5 v Thunder (yet to bat) - Melbourne Stars began the round at the bottom of the WBBL table but at the halfway point of their clash with Sydney Thunder their 141 has given them a fighting chance of earning points for the first time this year. Openers Elyse Villani and Lizelle Lee both struck 50s but the 39 balls faced by the other Stars yielded just two boundaries. All five Thunder bowlers each took one wicket. WBBL: Strikers 116-3 beat Scorchers 115-9 - Adelaide moved top of the WBBL table earlier today after a straightforward victory over Perth at Allan Border Field in Brisbane. Nicole Bolton\u2019s 41 was the only score of note as the Scorchers struggled to 116 from their 20 overs. Sarah Coyte bagged three wickets, Suzie Bates two, while Megan Schutt conceded just 14 runs from her four overs. The Strikers wrapped up their chase inside 15 overs, led by Tahlia McGrath\u2019s unbeaten 65 from just 46 deliveries. Rugby: While it might have been a rough night for the All Blacks in Japan, the reaction of their players, staff, and supporters has only reinforced how admirable New Zealand sporting culture is. Baseball: We\u2019re now tied at 2-2 in the World Series after the Astros thumped the Nationals in game four. Rugby: England stunned the rugby world with their World Cup semi-final demolition of the All Blacks and they\u2019ve pulled another surprise with the emergency call-up of scrum-half Ben Spencer. The Saracens back is in line to make his World Cup debut in next week\u2019s final. F1: There\u2019s some Formula 1 news to report with Max Verstappen losing his pole position at the Mexico GP after failing to slow down sufficiently when qualifying was under yellow flags. Cricket: Turning our attention to other sports now, there\u2019s our first look at the Australian men\u2019s cricket side for the summer over at Adelaide Oval. Geoff Lemon is on the OBO tools as Aaron Finch and David Warner begin strongly against Sri Lanka. That has been a thrilling series to follow. Netball is a tremendous product at the moment. Apologies for what might seem a cringeworthy term to use but I think it best sums up the combination of the quality of the sport, the presentation, accessibility, and the overall package. Super Netball was brilliant this season and the Constellation Cup was a belter. It was a victory secured in a dominant opening half and then clung on to in the face of a fierce New Zealand fightback. This has been a superb series, and it ends with two wins apiece, Australia keeping the trophy on goal percentage courtesy of their victory margins. Australia retain the Constellation Cup! Constellation Cup: Q4: 1 min rem: Australia 51-44 New Zealand - Courtney Bruce with a vital turnover with just over two minutes on the clock and in possession Australia take their time before feeding CBass to ice the game. Gretel Tippett then puts the cherry on the cake. Constellation Cup: Q4: 3 mins rem: Australia 49-43 New Zealand - Time\u2019s running out for the Silver Ferns but they are pushing hard. Constellation Cup: Q4: 5 mins rem: Australia 48-41 New Zealand - Just when the Silver Ferns were turning the screw a penalty is called against Folau and the Diamonds earn themselves some breathing space. Constellation Cup: Q4: 7 mins rem: Australia 45-40 New Zealand - Turnover goal to New Zealand, the margin is the narrowest it has been since the opening quarter. What has happened to Australia in the second halves this series!? Constellation Cup: Q4: 9 mins rem: Australia 44-38 New Zealand - New Zealand are now just six goals behind. Can they complete another heist? Constellation Cup: Q4: 11 mins rem: Australia 43-35 New Zealand - The Silver Ferns are not giving up without a fight but with Bassett in the circle for the Diamonds they are keeping New Zealand at arm\u2019s length. Another couple of goals and this could get nervy though... Constellation Cup: 3QT: Australia 41-32 New Zealand - The Silver Ferns threw everything at the Diamonds that quarter, and they made Australia wobble. But a late fightback from the hosts steadied the ship and despite losing the quarter by four goals they retina a strong lead heading into the last 15 minutes of the series. Constellation Cup: Q3: 7 mins rem: Australia 36-28 New Zealand - The Silver Ferns have come out firing since half-time and the Diamonds are under all sorts of pressure. The game has swung dramatically after that first-half procession. Australia missed only two shots at goal all half with both Tippett and Bassett excelling. The general stats are reasonably even except for New Zealand conceding seven more turnovers than the Diamonds, a figure reflected in Australia enjoying greater possession. Constellation Cup: HT: Australia 31-18 New Zealand - A dominant half from Australia, led by the imperious Caitlin Bassett in her 100th appearance. There was a warning just before the interval though with the Silver Ferns enjoying their best couple of minutes of the match. The Diamonds have won just three of 12 second-half quarters in this series, but even with that form they can\u2019t throw away such a massive lead... can they? Constellation Cup: Q2: 7 mins rem: Australia 24-11 New Zealand - Australia continue to dominate in the circles, Tippett and Bassett in attack and Bruce and Weston in defence. The Nissan net points are Australia 104 v -31 New Zealand; this has been as one-sided as the Diamonds could have dreamed of. Constellation Cup: Q2: 12 mins rem: Australia 21-8 New Zealand - The Diamonds are as sharp in possession as at any time this Constellation Cup - not my words, those of Cath Cox, who knows what she\u2019s talking about. Australia\u2019s lead continues to grow after quarter-time and they continue to be favoured by some helpful calls from the umpires, Maria Folau the latest to be penalised harshly. Constellation Cup: QT: Australia 16-7 New Zealand - Just the start Lisa Alexander was looking for. Her Diamonds matched the Silver Ferns for intensity and beat them for composure - especially in the circles - to take a significant lead at quarter-time. Bassett and Tippett have been outstanding in attack while New Zealand, and especially Laura Langman, have been uncharacteristically sloppy in possession. Constellation Cup: Q1: 1 mins rem: Australia 14-7 New Zealand - The Diamonds fail to convert an attacking opportunity for the first time in the match but it matters little because a superb defensive interception snuffs out any danger on the counter. The Silver Ferns attackers are being punished severely for the slightest indiscretion and the penalty count has ended with Bailey Mes being hauled off after her surprise inclusion as GS. Constellation Cup: Q1: 5 mins rem: Australia 10-6 New Zealand - It\u2019s no place for the timid out there with whistles for contact blown every few seconds. The Diamonds remain potent in possession though and they\u2019re building a handy early advantage. Constellation Cup: Q1: 9 mins rem: Australia 8-3 New Zealand - It\u2019s still frantic on court with both teams rushed in possession and forcing turnovers in defence. Caitlin Bassett has started superbly in her 100th for the Diamonds and her composure in the circle alongside Gretel Tippett is proving the early difference. Constellation Cup: Q1: 13 mins rem: Australia 1-1 New Zealand - Sloppy start from both sides with penalties and turnovers aplenty in the opening couple of minutes. The atmosphere is electric in Perth and you can sense the players are aware of the significance of the match. It\u2019s anthem time in Perth, and they are two of the best a capella renditions you could ever wish to hear. Hello everybody and welcome to another bumper day of Australian sport. Leading us off we have the conclusion of the Constellation Cup from Perth. Australia\u2019s Diamonds trail New Zealand\u2019s Silver Ferns 2-1 ahead of the final match in the series but the hosts will retain the cup on goal percentage if they can win at the RAC Arena. If Australia required any further motivation they have it in the announcement of Caitlin Thwaites\u2019 retirement and the occasion marking Caitlin Bassett\u2019s 100th international appearance. That one gets underway shortly after 1pm. Following that our attention will shift to the WBBL with the Thunder taking on the Stars and the Heat hosting the Hurricanes. We\u2019ll tune into those around 2.30pm. From 4pm the A-League takes centre stage. We begin with the distance derby over in Wellington where the Phoenix welcome Perth Glory. Then from 6pm Western United experience their first Melbourne derby against neighbours City. Richard Parkin will be in charge of the blog by then. In amongst all that there\u2019s the MotoGP from Phillip Island, build-up to the Mexican F1 GP, Rugby World Cup news and reaction, and plenty more besides.

Though Halloween has a lot to answer for, it would be unfair to rest all blame for the rise of fancy dress on its shoulders \u2013 the rise, and fall, and zombie-stripper-like rise. Fancy dress refuses to die. Which is odd because, of course, it should have faded away many times, swept into the bin of the British past like Gentleman\u2019s Relish or coatigans, most memorably after, haha, the pictures of Prince Harry as a Nazi. In 2005, he wore a German desert uniform and a swastika armband to a friend\u2019s birthday party in Wiltshire, which had the fancy dress theme \u201ccolonial and native\u201d.

I got out of bed, pulled on my TK Maxx Batman\u2122\u00ae lounging trousers and threw pine cones at the black space I imagined the doom-presaging hooter occupied. \u201cTu-whit tu-whoo.

But now, as the depressing Brexit bird swooped past me in the dark, dodging my futile projectiles, it seemed to have, plastered on to its owl-shaped head, the smirking face of Laura Kuenssberg. The evil TV homunculus can barely contain her obvious giggling delight when news goes the government\u2019s way, even if it is made-up news un-named Downing Street sources have given to her, knowing she will regurgitate it unquestioningly, like an owl pellet made of lies. \u201cTu-whit tu-whoo.

Perhaps Turds had broken the Groundhog Day loop and soon John Bercow, the Punxsutawney Phil of politics, will emerge barking from his ancient hole no more and the Bill Murray of Britain will be free. Monsters are abroad. That afternoon, when she was running, a black dog bit my wife in the leg, breaking the skin. On a woodland walk, my son and I came between an angry boar, hidden in high ferns, and its young. We climbed a lightning blackened stump, as if requesting an extension. And all around everything was full of menace. \u201cTu-whit tu-whoo! Woof woof!! Oink oink!!! We voted to leave!!!!\u201d</p> <p>I admit \u2013 I never really believed Brexit would happen.

      "bodyText": "A spiteful Leave owl howled outside my woodland cabin window all through Monday night, the gloom-bird of ill omen. \u201cTu-whit tu-whoo. We voted to leave,\u201d it cried. I am not a superstitious person, but the following day\u2019s Brexit vote was weighing heavily upon my restless Remoaner mind. \u201cHonk your triumphant misery outside someone else\u2019s half-term holiday hut, you swivel-eyed loon,\u201d I shouted into the dark. I got out of bed, pulled on my TK Maxx Batman\u2122\u00ae lounging trousers and threw pine cones at the black space I imagined the doom-presaging hooter occupied. \u201cTu-whit tu-whoo. We voted to leave.\u201d Earlier, I had calmed myself with a hot mix of Bovril, whisky and funny foraged forest fungi. But now, as the depressing Brexit bird swooped past me in the dark, dodging my futile projectiles, it seemed to have, plastered on to its owl-shaped head, the smirking face of Laura Kuenssberg. The evil TV homunculus can barely contain her obvious giggling delight when news goes the government\u2019s way, even if it is made-up news un-named Downing Street sources have given to her, knowing she will regurgitate it unquestioningly, like an owl pellet made of lies. \u201cTu-whit tu-whoo. We voted to leave.\u201d Ironically for Brexiter cheerleaders, should he finally implement his bullying Brexit bill, then all that is certain is that Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl\u2019s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Johnson will go down as the worst prime minister in British history. \u201cTu-whit tu-whoo. We voted to leave.\u201d On Tuesday night, I watched the Brexit bill pass on the same television, in the same hut, in the same almost-silent woodland, where I watched it fail six months ago, listening to the same twat owl and his hooting shit. Perhaps Turds had broken the Groundhog Day loop and soon John Bercow, the Punxsutawney Phil of politics, will emerge barking from his ancient hole no more and the Bill Murray of Britain will be free. Monsters are abroad. That afternoon, when she was running, a black dog bit my wife in the leg, breaking the skin. On a woodland walk, my son and I came between an angry boar, hidden in high ferns, and its young. We climbed a lightning blackened stump, as if requesting an extension. And all around everything was full of menace. \u201cTu-whit tu-whoo! Woof woof!! Oink oink!!! We voted to leave!!!!\u201d I admit \u2013 I never really believed Brexit would happen. Back in March, when the first Brexit deadline passed, I had felt a surge of optimism and resolved to eat and excrete my way through the tinned food and toilet roll supplies I had laid down in my Brexit bunker, as an act of faith. Every time I wiped myself clean on the recycled roll I had been saving for the now-deferred Mad Max meltdown, I gave thanks to Gina Miller and James O\u2019Brien and all those brave souls who had battled Brexit.

Almshouses provide sheltered but independent housing, often around a central courtyard, at affordable rents. Many offer social activities, on-site maintenance and \u2013 crucially \u2013 links with external groups.</p> <p>Worpole has been involved with the development of a new almshouse in Bermondsey, south London, for United St Saviour\u2019s, a 500-year-old charity. Construction is due to begin next spring and completed by the autumn of 2021.</p> <p>The project, says Worpole, \u201cseeks to actively retain longstanding entanglement of residents with the life of the neighbourhood, old friendships, local parks, libraries, shops and social activities. It is open to the world and still part of everyday life.\u201d</p> <p>The site of the new homes is on a busy high street, and designed to be accessible to the general public. A glass-fronted \u201ccommunity lounge\u201d will be available to local groups.</p> <p>Stephen Witherford, of the project\u2019s architects Witherford Watson Mann, said: \u201cAt the moment, older people tend to be moved to the margins of towns and cities, dislocating them from communities. Many die a social death before physical ailments kick in.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2faba32414418cd93ba6697d0553dcc9d062525b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2faba32414418cd93ba6697d0553dcc9d062525b/0_86_4241_2546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"OWCH in Barnet, north London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Older Women\u2019s Co-Housing (OWCH) in Barnet, north London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: OWCH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another radical approach is the Older Women\u2019s Co-Housing (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/14/lack-of-homes-suitable-for-older-people-fuels-housing-crisis-report\" title=\"\">OWCH</a>) project in Barnet, north London, which provides 25 flats to women aged between 53 and 90.

If you\u2019re passive, there\u2019s a danger of giving up.\u201d</p> <p>According to Silver Cities: Planning for an Ageing Population, a report by the Grosvenor property group, the proportion of over-65s in the global population will reach 25% by 2045.</p> <p>\u201cMany older Londoners are living alone in the family four-bedroomed home that they raised their children in, but which may not be suitable for an older person,\u201d says the report.</p> <p>The housing industry should \u201cfocus on building communities made up of homes for rent that will meet the needs of all demographics and not just the 25- to 35-year-olds whose faces often adorn modern development hoardings.\u201d</p>",

According to Worpole: \u201cIf the 20th century was the century of the child, then the 21st century is the century of the elderly.\u201d But politicians prefer to treat older people as a medical issue, he said. \u201cSpending money on medicalisation is simpler \u2013 politicians find it easier to spend money than think creatively \u2013 than building resilient communities that regard older people as important citizens.\u201d Institutionalised care homes are increasingly rejected by many people in favour of \u201cageing in place\u201d, which allows continued engagement in local communities. A new almshouse movement, advocated by some experts, builds on a way of living dating back to the 10th century. Almshouses provide sheltered but independent housing, often around a central courtyard, at affordable rents. Many offer social activities, on-site maintenance and \u2013 crucially \u2013 links with external groups. Worpole has been involved with the development of a new almshouse in Bermondsey, south London, for United St Saviour\u2019s, a 500-year-old charity. Construction is due to begin next spring and completed by the autumn of 2021. The project, says Worpole, \u201cseeks to actively retain longstanding entanglement of residents with the life of the neighbourhood, old friendships, local parks, libraries, shops and social activities. It is open to the world and still part of everyday life.\u201d The site of the new homes is on a busy high street, and designed to be accessible to the general public. A glass-fronted \u201ccommunity lounge\u201d will be available to local groups. Stephen Witherford, of the project\u2019s architects Witherford Watson Mann, said: \u201cAt the moment, older people tend to be moved to the margins of towns and cities, dislocating them from communities. Many die a social death before physical ailments kick in.\u201d Another radical approach is the Older Women\u2019s Co-Housing (OWCH) project in Barnet, north London, which provides 25 flats to women aged between 53 and 90. It was completed three years ago and is run as a collective, with all residents involved in decision-making. \u201cOlder people need to be encouraged to think about how they want to live their lives, and then take charge of that,\u201d said Angela Ratcliffe, a resident. \u201cThe longer you\u2019re in charge of your life, the mentally fitter you are. If you\u2019re passive, there\u2019s a danger of giving up.\u201d According to Silver Cities: Planning for an Ageing Population, a report by the Grosvenor property group, the proportion of over-65s in the global population will reach 25% by 2045. \u201cMany older Londoners are living alone in the family four-bedroomed home that they raised their children in, but which may not be suitable for an older person,\u201d says the report. The housing industry should \u201cfocus on building communities made up of homes for rent that will meet the needs of all demographics and not just the 25- to 35-year-olds whose faces often adorn modern development hoardings.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>You can never predict how \u2013 or where \u2013 a Paul Farley poem is going to land. This hugely enjoyable collection <em>The Mizzy</em> (nickname for a mistle thrush) is, among other things, a birder\u2019s book. The birds are scattered as in life \u2013 they alight between poems on other subjects. They have something of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/09/john-clare-poetry\" title=\"\">John Clare</a>\u2019s style or disarming lack of it (Farley was editor of a selection of Clare\u2019s poems for Faber in 2007). Like Clare, Farley is comradely towards nature, his bird\u2019s-eye view is respectful, his anthropomorphism not belittling.</p> <p>But he has his own wit and singular insights. What the robin shows him as it hops ahead, he passes on, a plain expression of a good thought: \u201c... showing us where the edge/ of the present moment is\u201d. </p> <p>People, although spotted less often, are seen with the same searching eye in all their irregularity. There are moving poems about a man one guesses to be Farley\u2019s father, though he never lets on who the subject is: a man who lived to bet on the horses. In Glorious Goodwood, racing is a fleet, all-consuming, barely containable metaphor:... \u201chis horse is still running and the horseflies/ still out for blood and in my blood\u2026\u201d</p> <p>In The Green Man, a devastating elegy about a man kicked to death in a pub car park, Farley\u2019s memorialising is as careful as the setting of a fire. It is a portrait not of who the man was, but what he knew (maybe the same thing). He taught \u201chow damp and sappy wood/ burned slowly with a yellowy-green flame\u201d, \u201chow to bluff at stud poker\u201d and would tell \u201cghost stories in a broken whisper\u201d.<br>This collection is a stirring miscellany: the opening poem, Starling, describes the bird\u2019s tendency to \u201cwitter on about my hole in the wall\u201d. Farley may have missed a trick by not publishing Hole in the Wall \u2013 his fantastical poem about an ATM \u2013 alongside it. Then there is Gentian Violet, an arresting poem inspired by Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 99 and DH Lawrence\u2019s <a href=\"https://allpoetry.com/Bavarian-Gentians\" title=\"\">Bavarian Gentians</a>.</p> <p>The Story of the Hangover is the most sober poem about alcohol ever stumbled upon, while there is a fabulously bizarre The Keeper of Red Carpets, about a carpet depot and the fellow who cleans carpets once the celebrities have finished promenading. Its last line is so right one ought to have \u2013 yet did not \u2013 see it coming: \u201cSomebody\u2019s always looking to make an entrance.\u201d</p> <p>Mistle Thrush is about language and where we would be without the tent pegs of vocabulary: \u201cThe word <em>picnic</em>/ is a tablecloth thrown on to the grass.\u201d</p> <p>In a reclusive, parallel universe, the Mizzy outperforms people in song. Farley meanwhile pulls the picnic rug out from under the poem, adding brand names with double identities before the coup that completes the picture: \u201cThe word <em>idyll</em> waits out of earshot./ A faun in the fountain burbles./ There is Sunblest. There is Golden Wonder./ And then, thunder.\u201d</p> <p>Farley also has a field day writing about technology\u2019s momentum. In The Gadget, he describes his mobile as if engaged in a restless form of birdwatching. It has an \u201cavian shrill\u201d and can \u201cthrum in your hand like a frightened bird\u201d. And in Life During the Great Acceleration \u2013 a small, jostling triumph of a poem \u2013 he imagines furriers, farriers, coopers in charge of insubstantial data. It ends with unsettling, unharmonious half-rhyme: \u201cI was a data tanner. I lifted your skin/ while it was still blood-warm with information.\u201d</p> <p>Farley does not let his poetic mastery mask the possibility that technology is mastering him \u2013 and us.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Mizzy</em> by Paul Farley is published by Picador (\u00a314.99).

This hugely enjoyable collection The Mizzy (nickname for a mistle thrush) is, among other things, a birder\u2019s book. The birds are scattered as in life \u2013 they alight between poems on other subjects. They have something of John Clare\u2019s style or disarming lack of it (Farley was editor of a selection of Clare\u2019s poems for Faber in 2007). Like Clare, Farley is comradely towards nature, his bird\u2019s-eye view is respectful, his anthropomorphism not belittling. But he has his own wit and singular insights. What the robin shows him as it hops ahead, he passes on, a plain expression of a good thought: \u201c... showing us where the edge/ of the present moment is\u201d. People, although spotted less often, are seen with the same searching eye in all their irregularity. There are moving poems about a man one guesses to be Farley\u2019s father, though he never lets on who the subject is: a man who lived to bet on the horses. In Glorious Goodwood, racing is a fleet, all-consuming, barely containable metaphor:... \u201chis horse is still running and the horseflies/ still out for blood and in my blood\u2026\u201d In The Green Man, a devastating elegy about a man kicked to death in a pub car park, Farley\u2019s memorialising is as careful as the setting of a fire. It is a portrait not of who the man was, but what he knew (maybe the same thing). He taught \u201chow damp and sappy wood/ burned slowly with a yellowy-green flame\u201d, \u201chow to bluff at stud poker\u201d and would tell \u201cghost stories in a broken whisper\u201d. This collection is a stirring miscellany: the opening poem, Starling, describes the bird\u2019s tendency to \u201cwitter on about my hole in the wall\u201d. Farley may have missed a trick by not publishing Hole in the Wall \u2013 his fantastical poem about an ATM \u2013 alongside it. Then there is Gentian Violet, an arresting poem inspired by Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 99 and DH Lawrence\u2019s Bavarian Gentians. The Story of the Hangover is the most sober poem about alcohol ever stumbled upon, while there is a fabulously bizarre The Keeper of Red Carpets, about a carpet depot and the fellow who cleans carpets once the celebrities have finished promenading. Its last line is so right one ought to have \u2013 yet did not \u2013 see it coming: \u201cSomebody\u2019s always looking to make an entrance.\u201d Mistle Thrush is about language and where we would be without the tent pegs of vocabulary: \u201cThe word picnic/ is a tablecloth thrown on to the grass.\u201d In a reclusive, parallel universe, the Mizzy outperforms people in song. Farley meanwhile pulls the picnic rug out from under the poem, adding brand names with double identities before the coup that completes the picture: \u201cThe word idyll waits out of earshot./ A faun in the fountain burbles./ There is Sunblest. There is Golden Wonder./ And then, thunder.\u201d Farley also has a field day writing about technology\u2019s momentum. In The Gadget, he describes his mobile as if engaged in a restless form of birdwatching. It has an \u201cavian shrill\u201d and can \u201cthrum in your hand like a frightened bird\u201d. And in Life During the Great Acceleration \u2013 a small, jostling triumph of a poem \u2013 he imagines furriers, farriers, coopers in charge of insubstantial data. It ends with unsettling, unharmonious half-rhyme: \u201cI was a data tanner. I lifted your skin/ while it was still blood-warm with information.\u201d Farley does not let his poetic mastery mask the possibility that technology is mastering him \u2013 and us. \u2022 The Mizzy by Paul Farley is published by Picador (\u00a314.99).

Phone orders min p&amp;p of \u00a31.99 Robin It\u2019s not so much that robins follow us more like they lead the way, going on ahead like useless guides with not one word of our language but fluent in flow and lode, flitting along whichever way we walk, breaking into song before we catch up, and they\u2019re off again, a few yards further into the future. We love them for this, for spelling it out, for showing us where the edge of the present moment is. A breeze has shook the holly or whitethorn and the robin has gone, leaving me on the sky-puddled tarmac straddling the powerlines, along the Black Path that forked under a streetlamp, beside the White Bridge where the open fields began and the smell of earth was strong. I\u2019ve stood in all of these places and a part of me stands there still, till a robin surfaces and I follow it out, as I did then. Robin, lead on.",

Well, no, because I could have had the whip removed and not been a Labour candidate.\u201d Some of the MPs say they end up under fire from all sides. \u201cI go to my constituency and they think, because I\u2019m a Labour MP, I\u2019m like [Lib Dem MPs] Jo Swinson or Chuka Umunna,\u201d says De Piero. \u201cThen I come to Westminster and some of my colleagues think I\u2019m like Nigel Farage. That is the gulf \u2026 I understand the pressures on colleagues who take a different view to me and respect them for it \u2013 but I\u2019d like them to respect my way.\u201d Most of the group are still reserving judgment on how they would vote should Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill return to the Commons unchanged. De Piero says: \u201cI have respect for my colleagues whatever they decide to do on the bill. I would say that you\u2019re not going to get more than half voting for the final deal.\u201d Others appear to have decided to back the Johnson deal to the end. \u201cI\u2019m reconciled to it,\u201d says Fitzpatrick. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. It has caused me a lot of grief. I get a lot of, \u2018This is what you\u2019ll be remembered for, you traitor\u2019. I said, \u2018I\u2019m surprised, because I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be remembered for anything\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The hurt and suffering that will long linger is etched on the faces of the All Blacks as they struggle to suppress the emotional scars of their World Cup semi-final defeat to England. New Zealand, as a rugby nation, has come a long way from the widespread outcry experienced during their 24-year wait between World Cup successes from 1987 to 2011. Expectations, though, have not wavered. In fact, after securing the last two World Cup titles, those on the team have only increased. The All Blacks are expected to win every match so the brutal, comprehensive nature of their England beating is particularly difficult to take. Carrying such a weight magnifies disappointment, especially on this grand stage. That is partly why the All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen needed a moment to hold back tears as he again fronted up to dissect his side\u2019s 19-7 loss. Not long after the final whistle Hansen was spotted on his phone, off to the side of the field. Asked who he had called, Hansen began to well up. \u201cI rang my wife,\u201d he said, pausing to sip water in order to prevent his emotions from bubbling over. After speaking to his wife, Hansen talked to the former All Blacks coach Graham Henry - nicknamed \u2018Ted\u2019 - and centre Conrad Smith. Both men were also involved with Hansen the last time New Zealand lost a World Cup match 12 years ago. \u201cI then talked to Ted and Conrad about \u201907 and we mentioned the fact it\u2019s no different, the same gutting feeling,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cThen Ted and I talked about how well George Ford had played. Ted had quite a few comments and I did a bit of listening, trying to do a bit of learning, and then you just move on don\u2019t you? \u201cIs it hard to stomach? Course it is. It\u2019s gut-wrenching because we wanted to win the thing but so did they. Life\u2019s not fair so why would sport be fair. You don\u2019t always get the thing you want. And when you don\u2019t you\u2019ve got to measure your character on how you deal with that.\u201d The All Blacks have to channel their pain into a game no one wants play \u2013 the playoff for third and fourth in Tokyo on Friday, one day before the final. \u201cIt\u2019s unique because it\u2019s knockout and you don\u2019t get a second chance,\u201d Hansen said, \u201cso the pain isn\u2019t alleviated by playing another Test next week. \u201cWhoever we play won\u2019t alleviate the pain that we haven\u2019t achieved what we wanted to which was come here and win it.

Sometimes you just have to bite down on your gum shield and suck it up.\u201d Other than Ford, Hansen praised the England lock Maro Itoje, the man of the match, saying he was a more complete player than when he featured for the British and Irish Lions two years ago and that he could evolve into a great of the game. \u201cThis England team hasn\u2019t just snuck up and poked us in the face.

A major disagreement erupted over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/20/march-for-change-anti-brexit-protesters-take-to-london-streets\" title=\"\">March for Change</a>, a pro-Remain rally in London in July. The event, set up by a small group of campaigners wanting to embrace a more explicitly pro-Remain stance, caused outrage among some in the People\u2019s Vote headquarters in Millbank Tower. Opponents regarded it as picking \u201cthe wrong time, the wrong message and the wrong people\u201d.</p> <p>Frustrations led staff to sign an extraordinary letter. \u201cThis splinter group has confused our supporters, diverted staff attention and resources, disrupted our relationship with our local groups and grassroots activists, as well as seriously damaging morale,\u201d it stated. \u201cGiven the differences in strategy, fundraising and data collection, it is necessary to formalise the separation between us.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope our views will be listened to and it is understood why it is necessary to make serious and urgent changes to our organisation and governance \u2026 If these matters are not speedily and fully resolved, we fear that a number of our valued colleagues will resign \u2013 potentially derailing the campaign at a crucial point, destroying morale and risking adverse publicity.\u201d</p> <p>The letter remains highly contentious. While some claim almost 60 members of staff signed it, others say some signatories were pressured into doing so, while others later retracted their names or had not seen the text. \u201cThere are bound to be differences of emphasis in campaigns,\u201d said one sympathetic official. \u201cSome people decided March for Change was more of an enemy than the Brexiteers.\u201d</p> <p>Campaign chiefs were also accused of giving too much support to Labour in the European elections, against advice and despite the party\u2019s ambiguous Brexit stance.</p> <p>However, the most recent warring has centred on the decision by Roland Rudd, the PR guru, to form a new company to oversee a potential Remain campaign. Rudd is the outgoing chair of Open Britain, the most powerful group under the People\u2019s Vote umbrella. The new company, called Baybridge, has several Open Britain directors on its board, including the businessman Richard Reed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04df5f0af45232b61d96024044dc259ca9683e6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04df5f0af45232b61d96024044dc259ca9683e6c/0_139_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The March for Change in London in July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The March for Change in London in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Critics describe the plan as a move by Rudd to consolidate his power over a future campaign and oust James McGrory, the director of People\u2019s Vote, and Tom Baldwin, its director of communications. However, allies of Rudd said the company was part of a plan to bring order to the campaign, and that it would have a large board and some directors directly elected from grassroots Remain organisations. They claimed some pro-Remain groups had already signed up.</p> <p>\u201cThe People\u2019s Vote campaign has done amazingly well, but we can\u2019t rest easy because we still haven\u2019t got there,\u201d said a supporter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be unified and you do that by all being part of one group.\u201d</p> <p>Opponents of the Rudd plan said that a rival campaign blueprint, drawn up earlier this year by philanthropist Stephen Dawson, was ready to go and should be pursued. It envisages making Michael Heseltine, the former Tory deputy leader, campaign chair and appointing Labour\u2019s Margaret Beckett and former Tory MP Dominic Grieve as his deputies. </p> <p>Several sources also cited a strategic disagreement, with Rudd wanting to embrace a more pro-Remain position and campaign directors wanting to concentrate on winning over soft Leave voters and wavering Labour and Tory MPs. One figure described Rudd\u2019s group as the \u201cKensington splinter\u201d, adding: \u201cWhatever he says, Rudd at heart doesn\u2019t understand how another referendum has to be won on the streets of Pontefract, rather than over cocktails in Phillimore Gardens [a premium Kensington address].\u201d</p> <p>A Rudd ally disputed the description: \u201cRoland spends huge amounts of time trying to win over new supporters, but at the same time, it\u2019s just absurd to pretend that many of our grassroots supporters aren\u2019t driven by a desire to reverse this madness. Their concerns shouldn\u2019t dictate the campaign, but they should be respected.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the clashes, senior officials still believe a second referendum can be achieved. \u201cWe are still very much in the fight,\u201d said one. \u201cWe have come so far and we believe we are close in terms of votes in parliament. And if there\u2019s an election and we run a trusted tactical voting campaign, we\u2019re in business.\u201d</p>",

The event, set up by a small group of campaigners wanting to embrace a more explicitly pro-Remain stance, caused outrage among some in the People\u2019s Vote headquarters in Millbank Tower. Opponents regarded it as picking \u201cthe wrong time, the wrong message and the wrong people\u201d. Frustrations led staff to sign an extraordinary letter. \u201cThis splinter group has confused our supporters, diverted staff attention and resources, disrupted our relationship with our local groups and grassroots activists, as well as seriously damaging morale,\u201d it stated. \u201cGiven the differences in strategy, fundraising and data collection, it is necessary to formalise the separation between us. \u201cWe hope our views will be listened to and it is understood why it is necessary to make serious and urgent changes to our organisation and governance \u2026 If these matters are not speedily and fully resolved, we fear that a number of our valued colleagues will resign \u2013 potentially derailing the campaign at a crucial point, destroying morale and risking adverse publicity.\u201d The letter remains highly contentious. While some claim almost 60 members of staff signed it, others say some signatories were pressured into doing so, while others later retracted their names or had not seen the text. \u201cThere are bound to be differences of emphasis in campaigns,\u201d said one sympathetic official. \u201cSome people decided March for Change was more of an enemy than the Brexiteers.\u201d Campaign chiefs were also accused of giving too much support to Labour in the European elections, against advice and despite the party\u2019s ambiguous Brexit stance. However, the most recent warring has centred on the decision by Roland Rudd, the PR guru, to form a new company to oversee a potential Remain campaign. Rudd is the outgoing chair of Open Britain, the most powerful group under the People\u2019s Vote umbrella. The new company, called Baybridge, has several Open Britain directors on its board, including the businessman Richard Reed. Critics describe the plan as a move by Rudd to consolidate his power over a future campaign and oust James McGrory, the director of People\u2019s Vote, and Tom Baldwin, its director of communications. However, allies of Rudd said the company was part of a plan to bring order to the campaign, and that it would have a large board and some directors directly elected from grassroots Remain organisations. They claimed some pro-Remain groups had already signed up. \u201cThe People\u2019s Vote campaign has done amazingly well, but we can\u2019t rest easy because we still haven\u2019t got there,\u201d said a supporter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be unified and you do that by all being part of one group.\u201d Opponents of the Rudd plan said that a rival campaign blueprint, drawn up earlier this year by philanthropist Stephen Dawson, was ready to go and should be pursued. It envisages making Michael Heseltine, the former Tory deputy leader, campaign chair and appointing Labour\u2019s Margaret Beckett and former Tory MP Dominic Grieve as his deputies. Several sources also cited a strategic disagreement, with Rudd wanting to embrace a more pro-Remain position and campaign directors wanting to concentrate on winning over soft Leave voters and wavering Labour and Tory MPs. One figure described Rudd\u2019s group as the \u201cKensington splinter\u201d, adding: \u201cWhatever he says, Rudd at heart doesn\u2019t understand how another referendum has to be won on the streets of Pontefract, rather than over cocktails in Phillimore Gardens [a premium Kensington address].\u201d A Rudd ally disputed the description: \u201cRoland spends huge amounts of time trying to win over new supporters, but at the same time, it\u2019s just absurd to pretend that many of our grassroots supporters aren\u2019t driven by a desire to reverse this madness. Their concerns shouldn\u2019t dictate the campaign, but they should be respected.\u201d Despite the clashes, senior officials still believe a second referendum can be achieved. \u201cWe are still very much in the fight,\u201d said one. \u201cWe have come so far and we believe we are close in terms of votes in parliament. And if there\u2019s an election and we run a trusted tactical voting campaign, we\u2019re in business.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Political activist Steve Bray, 50, is known as \u201cMr Stop Brexit\u201d. Since September 2017, the former rare coins dealer from Port Talbot, South Wales, has braved all weathers to mount his <a href=\"https://sodemaction.co.uk/\" title=\"\">\u201cStand of Defiance European Movement\u201d (Sodem)</a> protest outside parliament every day it sits. He is notorious for photobombing live news broadcasts.</p> <p><strong>Take us back to the beginning. How did you get into all this?</strong><br>This is my first ever protest and it\u2019s lasted two years. I was never that political or loyal to any party, but it began with arguments online in the run-up to the referendum. I lost most of my friends, including a couple of lifelong ones, because I realised they were racist, xenophobic and downright pig-ignorant. I joined a few online groups and had news channels on permanently, but all the coverage was about migrants or scaremongering. I decided there must be some way to counter this.</p> <p><strong>How did your activism move offline and on to the streets?</strong><br>I was battling online, day in, day out. It was relentless and I thought: \u201cI can do better on the streets.\u201d In February 2017, I joined a group hanging flags on bridges. Then for the first march, in 2017, we brought over the Dusseldorf carnival float, designed by [German sculptor] Jacques Tilly, of a 12ft Theresa May head with a Brexit gun in her mouth. I drove it all around London and got pulled over by police in the Mall. I parked it outside the BBC while May was on <em>The One Show</em>. I drove it all over the UK until it eventually collapsed. The papier-mache wasn\u2019t strong and stable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The BBC built a five-metre high platform, but I just got a long pole to keep\u00a0my flags in the\u00a0frame</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What made you move your activities to outside </strong><strong>parliament?</strong><br>In June 2017, the DUP were given \u00a31bn and I thought: that\u2019s our taxes. The government was using our money to buy votes that they couldn\u2019t win democratically. I decided to do a campaign called A Week on the Streets, Not a Penny More. I went all over London, joining vigils and giving out leaflets.</p> <p>Towards the end of that week, I went on to College Green with a couple of flags. Some chap came over and said: \u201cI\u2019m Black Rod of the House of Lords and I\u2019m asking you to move.\u201d I said: \u201cI\u2019m here to protest.\u201d He pointed to Old Palace Yard and said: \u201cIf you go up there, you won\u2019t have a problem.\u201d It\u2019s only 100 yards away, bang opposite the main entrance to parliament. I thought: \u201cThis is fantastic, I\u2019m going to stay here.\u201d I\u2019m still there 26 months later. It all happened totally by accident. I\u2019m an accidental activist.</p> <p><strong>How do you fund yourself?</strong><br>I stopped working three years ago to do this. I was self-employed, dealing in coins, 16th century onwards, and sold a chunk of stock to give me capital. Since then, it\u2019s been like-minded people chipping in to help.</p> <p><strong>What are your tactics for getting </strong><strong>on to news broadcasts?</strong><br>I targeted the media right from the off, to get a message out there. Initially, I\u2019d get on camera holding an EU flag. That evolved into placards and a loudhailer. People started to notice when I moved from camera to camera during interviews to stay in shot. Then the BBC built a five-metre high platform, but I just got a long pole to keep my flags in frame. It\u2019s a game of cat and mouse but there\u2019s mutual respect between me and the camera crews. If they\u2019re filming a story about something tragic and non-Brexit-related, they\u2019ll tip me off and I\u2019ll stop everyone shouting. There\u2019s an understanding.</p> <p><strong>How did your trademark outfit come about?</strong><br>Originally, I bought an old black flocked top hat in a charity shop for \u00a32. That was a mistake because it took \u00a324 worth of spray cans to paint it blue. I put stickers on it saying \u201cStop Brexit\u201d, but they kept falling off. At one event, it said \u201cTop Brexit\u201d! So now I wear a blue hat and use superglue to stick on a yellow hatband saying \u201cStop Brexit\u201d. I\u2019m onto my fourth hat now. One got sun-bleached during the heatwave and faded so quickly, it went purple and looked like a UKIP hat. I replaced that pretty fast.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve met many politicians over the past two years. Have any surprised you?</strong><br>I\u2019ve met loads but there\u2019s also a lot that avoid me (<em>laughs</em>). When Mark Francois spots me, his little face lights up.

      "bodyText": "Political activist Steve Bray, 50, is known as \u201cMr Stop Brexit\u201d. Since September 2017, the former rare coins dealer from Port Talbot, South Wales, has braved all weathers to mount his \u201cStand of Defiance European Movement\u201d (Sodem) protest outside parliament every day it sits. He is notorious for photobombing live news broadcasts. Take us back to the beginning. How did you get into all this? This is my first ever protest and it\u2019s lasted two years. I was never that political or loyal to any party, but it began with arguments online in the run-up to the referendum. I lost most of my friends, including a couple of lifelong ones, because I realised they were racist, xenophobic and downright pig-ignorant. I joined a few online groups and had news channels on permanently, but all the coverage was about migrants or scaremongering. I decided there must be some way to counter this. How did your activism move offline and on to the streets? I was battling online, day in, day out. It was relentless and I thought: \u201cI can do better on the streets.\u201d In February 2017, I joined a group hanging flags on bridges. Then for the first march, in 2017, we brought over the Dusseldorf carnival float, designed by [German sculptor] Jacques Tilly, of a 12ft Theresa May head with a Brexit gun in her mouth. I drove it all around London and got pulled over by police in the Mall. I parked it outside the BBC while May was on The One Show. I drove it all over the UK until it eventually collapsed. The papier-mache wasn\u2019t strong and stable. What made you move your activities to outside parliament? In June 2017, the DUP were given \u00a31bn and I thought: that\u2019s our taxes. The government was using our money to buy votes that they couldn\u2019t win democratically. I decided to do a campaign called A Week on the Streets, Not a Penny More. I went all over London, joining vigils and giving out leaflets. Towards the end of that week, I went on to College Green with a couple of flags. Some chap came over and said: \u201cI\u2019m Black Rod of the House of Lords and I\u2019m asking you to move.\u201d I said: \u201cI\u2019m here to protest.\u201d He pointed to Old Palace Yard and said: \u201cIf you go up there, you won\u2019t have a problem.\u201d It\u2019s only 100 yards away, bang opposite the main entrance to parliament. I thought: \u201cThis is fantastic, I\u2019m going to stay here.\u201d I\u2019m still there 26 months later. It all happened totally by accident. I\u2019m an accidental activist. How do you fund yourself? I stopped working three years ago to do this. I was self-employed, dealing in coins, 16th century onwards, and sold a chunk of stock to give me capital. Since then, it\u2019s been like-minded people chipping in to help. What are your tactics for getting on to news broadcasts? I targeted the media right from the off, to get a message out there. Initially, I\u2019d get on camera holding an EU flag. That evolved into placards and a loudhailer. People started to notice when I moved from camera to camera during interviews to stay in shot. Then the BBC built a five-metre high platform, but I just got a long pole to keep my flags in frame. It\u2019s a game of cat and mouse but there\u2019s mutual respect between me and the camera crews. If they\u2019re filming a story about something tragic and non-Brexit-related, they\u2019ll tip me off and I\u2019ll stop everyone shouting. There\u2019s an understanding. How did your trademark outfit come about? Originally, I bought an old black flocked top hat in a charity shop for \u00a32. That was a mistake because it took \u00a324 worth of spray cans to paint it blue. I put stickers on it saying \u201cStop Brexit\u201d, but they kept falling off. At one event, it said \u201cTop Brexit\u201d! So now I wear a blue hat and use superglue to stick on a yellow hatband saying \u201cStop Brexit\u201d. I\u2019m onto my fourth hat now. One got sun-bleached during the heatwave and faded so quickly, it went purple and looked like a UKIP hat. I replaced that pretty fast. You\u2019ve met many politicians over the past two years. Have any surprised you? I\u2019ve met loads but there\u2019s also a lot that avoid me (laughs). When Mark Francois spots me, his little face lights up. He can\u2019t wait to chat. Yet when he\u2019s on telly and I\u2019m shouting, he says: \u201cIf we leave the EU, this idiot will shut up.\u201d Then he walks off camera and he\u2019s dead friendly again. On my birthday, Steve Baker wished me many happy returns, then him and Mark Francois posed for a selfie with me. The most amiable of the ERG lot, believe it or not, is Jacob Rees-Mogg.

The great Rabbie Burns was once so riled by a Scottish reviewer that he <a href=\"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/01/thou-eunuch-of-language.html\" title=\"\">wrote to him</a>: \u201cThou eunuch of language\u2026 thou pickle-herring in the puppet-show of nonsense\u201d and, most cutting of all: \u201cThou Englishman, who never was south the Tweed.\u201d All of which makes Martin Amis calling Tibor Fischer \u201ca creep and a wretch\u2026 and a fat-arse\u201d seem positively mild.

Sometimes the consolations of philosophy are simply not enough.</p> \n<p>Legal recourse is the other option. \u201cIt is not my habit to reply to hostile book reviews, but a personal attack that amounts to libel is another matter,\u201d boomed Niall Ferguson in the <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n22/letters\" title=\"\">letters pages</a> of the <em>London Review of Books</em> in 2011, responding to a sharp-edged article by Pankaj Mishra. \u201cI am, I repeat, owed an apology.\u201d </p> \n<p>The petty rivalries and colourful invective involved in bouts between critic and artist have, at least, a quaint charm. But there\u2019s little charming about squabbles over amateur star ratings on Amazon. In our consumer-oriented review culture, everyone\u2019s a critic and nobody has a clue. \u201cReview bombing\u201d, a reverse marketing strategy in which crowds of online visitors leave negative reviews to sink a product, is the latest headache (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/10/captain-marvel-brie-larson-middling-marvel\" title=\"\"><em>Captain Marvel</em></a>, starring Brie Larson, which garnered more than 50,000 largely negative reviews within hours of its release). With the waters so muddied, clear-sighted criticism seems more important than ever.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo write about me is nothing like it is to be with me,\u201d Del Rey complained of Powers\u2019s review. That may be so, but the task of the reviewer isn\u2019t really to connect with the artist on their own terms \u2013 it\u2019s to offer a pathway through the work and intelligent company along the way. In any case, it\u2019s worth remembering the old joke about the food critic who gave a restaurant such a bad review that he woke up to find a horse\u2019s head in his bed.</p> \n<p>He ate it.

(To be fair, Fischer had remarked that reading Amis\u2019s novel Yellow Dog was like finding \u201cyour favourite uncle being caught in a school playground, masturbating\u201d.) The trouble is that there is no longer anywhere for a critic to hide. A byline is enough to track someone down online. \u201cI will hate you till the day I die and wish you nothing but ill will in every career move you make,\u201d was Alain de Botton\u2019s comment on Caleb Crain\u2019s website following Crain\u2019s review of his The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work. Sometimes the consolations of philosophy are simply not enough. Legal recourse is the other option. \u201cIt is not my habit to reply to hostile book reviews, but a personal attack that amounts to libel is another matter,\u201d boomed Niall Ferguson in the letters pages of the London Review of Books in 2011, responding to a sharp-edged article by Pankaj Mishra. \u201cI am, I repeat, owed an apology.\u201d The petty rivalries and colourful invective involved in bouts between critic and artist have, at least, a quaint charm. But there\u2019s little charming about squabbles over amateur star ratings on Amazon. In our consumer-oriented review culture, everyone\u2019s a critic and nobody has a clue. \u201cReview bombing\u201d, a reverse marketing strategy in which crowds of online visitors leave negative reviews to sink a product, is the latest headache (see Captain Marvel, starring Brie Larson, which garnered more than 50,000 largely negative reviews within hours of its release). With the waters so muddied, clear-sighted criticism seems more important than ever. \u201cTo write about me is nothing like it is to be with me,\u201d Del Rey complained of Powers\u2019s review. That may be so, but the task of the reviewer isn\u2019t really to connect with the artist on their own terms \u2013 it\u2019s to offer a pathway through the work and intelligent company along the way. In any case, it\u2019s worth remembering the old joke about the food critic who gave a restaurant such a bad review that he woke up to find a horse\u2019s head in his bed. He ate it. And gave that a bad review, too. Shahidha Bari is an academic and broadcaster and former winner of the Observer/Anthony Burgess prize for arts journalism.

She combines classic beauty looks with radical fantasy \u2013 at the recent spring 2020 shows she was busy, creating moments. She was responsible for spider-leg lashes at Olivier Theyskens, for wildflowers framing models\u2019 faces at Giambattista Valli, and glittering black discs of eyeliner, like 50s sunglasses, at Halpern. Last September she worked with Nick Knight for British <em>Vogue</em>\u2019s cover featuring Rihanna in a floral mane, black-red lips and razor-thin eyebrows. They were the subject of much debate. <em>Good Morning Britain</em> even went to the trouble of recreating the look. Ffrench does this, daily. She starts quiet conversations about what looks right, and how, and why \u2013 a flick of her pen and a celebrity appears in a different light. On her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/isamayaffrench/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a>, she is her own model. Ffrench\u2019s Cindy Sherman-like experimentation with prosthetics, masks and bleach sits alongside the pure glamour of Kendall Jenner gazing out of the frame as a silent movie star.</p> <p>\u201cI feel so honoured to be alive in the time of the Kardashians,\u201d Ffrench says today, with genuine glee. \u201cWhat an amazing spectacle and cultural phenomenon, don\u2019t you think? I mean, if you can separate that from the growth of such an illness of narcissistic self-indulgence, that pathology.\u201d She sips her decaff thoughtfully. \u201cThey\u2019ve dominated ideas of what wealth looks like, they\u2019ve presented themselves as status symbols. They\u2019ve dictated what beauty is. So I think, of course, people want to emulate it.\u201d</p> <p>She likes to subvert traditional ideas of beauty, often using illustration, or digital abstraction. For the cover of <em>Dazed Beauty</em> she used an AI system that analysed 17,000 images from Instagram to learn what society considers beautiful. Using the imagery generated, she created hair and makeup looks for Kylie Jenner \u2013 in the pictures, Jenner\u2019s face appears to be melting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c697c35390c10e5e520e814dcd7bc8b4e1275894\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c697c35390c10e5e520e814dcd7bc8b4e1275894/0_13_2324_2903/801.jpg\" alt=\"Purr-fect: the \u2018sexy tiger\u2019 makeup that led to a shoot for i-D.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Purr-fect: the \u2018sexy tiger\u2019 makeup that led to a shoot for i-D.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Rutherford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This intersection of mainstream glamour and boundary-testing experimentation is what separates her from her peers and what led brands such as YSL, Tom Ford and Christian Louboutin to sign her as a collaborator.

And she found she was good at it, slightly too good \u2013 her butterflies looked as if they were going to fly away by the time the cake came out. \u201cJust like makeup, kid\u2019s face painting is about spacing things in a nicely aesthetic way and brushwork is as important as speed. When you\u2019re doing a party of 30 kids you\u2019ve got like seven minutes per face. So you\u2019ve really got to bash them out.\u201d It was excellent practice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4874237ca8c2346c01f85a0ce1bcef9ffc37a331\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4874237ca8c2346c01f85a0ce1bcef9ffc37a331/0_1715_4912_2948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SS20B-Halpern-010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nail it: a Halpern model made up by Ffrench.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Lloyd Evans</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One weekend a friend asked her to make his girlfriend up as a \u201csexy tiger\u201d, and the photos led to someone in her dance company recommending her for a shoot for <em>i-D</em> magazine. She was tasked with turning a group of boys into gods \u2013 which led to a new career painting a lot of penises, often gold. \u201cI remember on one shoot, I was working with a professional makeup artist. And there was a moment where I was washing my huge brushes in the sink, and I saw her packing away her immaculate little kit, and I was like, \u2018Well, that looks much easier\u2026\u2019\u201d She adjusted her focus, moving away from \u201cgenital work\u201d, upwards, to faces. Her early work drew on her cleverness with prosthetics, typically requiring her to \u201ccover the model in glitter then make it look like they had a broken nose,\u201d but along the way she taught herself the basics of colour, of \u201cglow\u201d, of makeup tricks. \u201cLike, filling in eyebrows really helps with the structure of the face\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as \u2018good skin\u2019. To make it look balanced, it\u2019s about learning colour correcting.\u201d Much of what she knows, she chuckles, comes from one of makeup artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/may/11/guardianobituaries.veronicahorwell\" title=\"\">Kevyn Aucoin\u2019s</a> books that she pored over at the age of seven.</p> <p>The first time her work appeared in a high-fashion magazine it was for a shoot where she turned an elegant model into a chameleon. Themes of metamorphosis continue to interest her. Last year she created a series of teeth mouldings for an exhibition that examined the future of fashion and body modification. But it was that shoot that led photographers and stylists to notice her, and see that they could trust her skills with an eyeliner, \u201cAnd maybe that I wasn\u2019t necessarily going to do anything too scary or mental.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsamaya is a rising talent,\u201d Christian Louboutin emails, \u201can artist with something to say and express. She is witty and serious, understated and dramatic, colourful and lively.\u201d They\u2019ve recently developed a makeup collection together: \u201cIsamaya managed to create something still very close to my aesthetic, but twisted with her own contemporary and unconventional creative vocabulary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b1bf9f90ec0dcc704fe4b6790d51afe76ce41e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b1bf9f90ec0dcc704fe4b6790d51afe76ce41e1/629_1319_3575_4468/800.jpg\" alt=\"The eyes have it: makeup by Isamaya Ffrench.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What\u2019s interesting now is the inclusion of gender fluidity\u2019: Isamaya Ffrench in purple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Wilks/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For somebody who still works with face paint and prosthetics, famous for their dark creativity, the association with mainstream beauty brands sometimes seems surprising. \u201cWell, there\u2019s an associative element that goes with it,\u201d Ffrench explains. \u201cJust aligning themselves with me says something about the brand and their philosophy, and what they\u2019re trying to achieve. It doesn\u2019t, as I\u2019ve learned many times, mean I\u2019m going to do any crazy shit with them, sadly.\u201d A theatrical sigh.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a hell of a lot of control over big brands \u2013 most of the time it\u2019s three blokes in suits who are calling all the shots. So I\u2019m learning that it\u2019s quite unusual to ever be in a position of creative direction where you\u2019re actually going to make huge changes, because it\u2019s so well protected. And that\u2019s what all those people in suits are there to do, to financially safeguard them. But fashion is helping shift that vision by, for instance, talking about inclusive beauty. So now brands are more open to working with casting more interesting faces, and freshening their image.\u201d She smiles. \u201cThings are definitely moving forward.\u201d</p> <p>Where does she see it moving to?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70e5354b87966e9c8829f8a05d54f678625e5039\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70e5354b87966e9c8829f8a05d54f678625e5039/0_925_3712_2227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018An artist who works with makeup\u2019: Isamaya Ffrench\u2019s vision for a Giambattista Valli model.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An artist who works with makeup\u2019: Isamaya Ffrench\u2019s vision for a Giambattista Valli model.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Lloyd-Evans</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOoh,\u201d she grins, leaning back for a brief lecture on the history of beauty. \u201cWell, beauty is often associated with fertility and wealth. So, back in the Renaissance period, chunky women were considered very beautiful, because they were rich enough to eat and therefore have healthy kids, and then we fast-forward to the 90s when it was a status symbol to show you were rich enough not to eat \u2013 anorexia culture came into play. Thinness defined one\u2019s wealth. And wealth also often means health as well. Then the Kardashians came along, and linked up beauty and the cosmetic industry, the idea that symmetry means \u2018good genes\u2019. It\u2019s a psychological thing as much as a trend thing. And I think what\u2019s interesting right now is the inclusion of gender fluidity. We\u2019ve had \u2018perfect\u2019 feminine faces for a very long time, but now we have inclusivity in terms of racial diversity and also gender diversity. So that will also fundamentally change the way that we consider wealth and fertility. Right?\u201d</p> <p>Before I can answer she\u2019s thinking about the future. \u201cWhat I think will happen next as well is that physical health will become even more equated with beauty. From somehow displaying say, your maximum lung capacity or your energy levels or how long your telomeres, your strands of DNA are. Beauty will be about how healthy a person is down to a cellular level, because, just like in Renaissance times, that\u2019s probably an indication that they\u2019re a fertile person.\u201d These are themes she\u2019s been thinking about in advance of a documentary she\u2019s making that will investigate beauty today, including, but not limited to: beauty ideals for trans people, beauty ideals for a generation that\u2019s grown up on Instagram, women in Iran who wear plasters on their nose to pretend they\u2019ve had rhinoplasty, and the exoticism of the Kardashian face, one that draws on black culture but relies on white privilege.</p> <p>She is especially fascinated by the intersection of beauty and science, her predictions occasionally spinning into dystopian places that leave us silent for a second. \u201cThe fact that up to 80% of women in Korea get plastic surgery is interesting, isn\u2019t it? Especially when you start to think about their kids, and the money they\u2019ll spend on their surgery. On shaving their jaws. But then there are developments in genetics, a process of choice now with pregnancy, where you can start to decide what your baby looks like. It\u2019s happening!\u201d Under the table I notice my knee bouncing, a new restlessness, and I am keen, suddenly, to return to subjects like, the best foundations for olive skin. The secret to natural makeup. The perfect red lip.<br></p>",

Her early work drew on her cleverness with prosthetics, typically requiring her to \u201ccover the model in glitter then make it look like they had a broken nose,\u201d but along the way she taught herself the basics of colour, of \u201cglow\u201d, of makeup tricks. \u201cLike, filling in eyebrows really helps with the structure of the face\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as \u2018good skin\u2019. To make it look balanced, it\u2019s about learning colour correcting.\u201d Much of what she knows, she chuckles, comes from one of makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin\u2019s books that she pored over at the age of seven. The first time her work appeared in a high-fashion magazine it was for a shoot where she turned an elegant model into a chameleon. Themes of metamorphosis continue to interest her. Last year she created a series of teeth mouldings for an exhibition that examined the future of fashion and body modification. But it was that shoot that led photographers and stylists to notice her, and see that they could trust her skills with an eyeliner, \u201cAnd maybe that I wasn\u2019t necessarily going to do anything too scary or mental.\u201d \u201cIsamaya is a rising talent,\u201d Christian Louboutin emails, \u201can artist with something to say and express. She is witty and serious, understated and dramatic, colourful and lively.\u201d They\u2019ve recently developed a makeup collection together: \u201cIsamaya managed to create something still very close to my aesthetic, but twisted with her own contemporary and unconventional creative vocabulary.\u201d For somebody who still works with face paint and prosthetics, famous for their dark creativity, the association with mainstream beauty brands sometimes seems surprising. \u201cWell, there\u2019s an associative element that goes with it,\u201d Ffrench explains. \u201cJust aligning themselves with me says something about the brand and their philosophy, and what they\u2019re trying to achieve. It doesn\u2019t, as I\u2019ve learned many times, mean I\u2019m going to do any crazy shit with them, sadly.\u201d A theatrical sigh. \u201cThere\u2019s always a hell of a lot of control over big brands \u2013 most of the time it\u2019s three blokes in suits who are calling all the shots. So I\u2019m learning that it\u2019s quite unusual to ever be in a position of creative direction where you\u2019re actually going to make huge changes, because it\u2019s so well protected. And that\u2019s what all those people in suits are there to do, to financially safeguard them. But fashion is helping shift that vision by, for instance, talking about inclusive beauty. So now brands are more open to working with casting more interesting faces, and freshening their image.\u201d She smiles. \u201cThings are definitely moving forward.\u201d Where does she see it moving to? \u201cOoh,\u201d she grins, leaning back for a brief lecture on the history of beauty. \u201cWell, beauty is often associated with fertility and wealth. So, back in the Renaissance period, chunky women were considered very beautiful, because they were rich enough to eat and therefore have healthy kids, and then we fast-forward to the 90s when it was a status symbol to show you were rich enough not to eat \u2013 anorexia culture came into play. Thinness defined one\u2019s wealth. And wealth also often means health as well. Then the Kardashians came along, and linked up beauty and the cosmetic industry, the idea that symmetry means \u2018good genes\u2019. It\u2019s a psychological thing as much as a trend thing. And I think what\u2019s interesting right now is the inclusion of gender fluidity. We\u2019ve had \u2018perfect\u2019 feminine faces for a very long time, but now we have inclusivity in terms of racial diversity and also gender diversity. So that will also fundamentally change the way that we consider wealth and fertility. Right?\u201d Before I can answer she\u2019s thinking about the future. \u201cWhat I think will happen next as well is that physical health will become even more equated with beauty. From somehow displaying say, your maximum lung capacity or your energy levels or how long your telomeres, your strands of DNA are. Beauty will be about how healthy a person is down to a cellular level, because, just like in Renaissance times, that\u2019s probably an indication that they\u2019re a fertile person.\u201d These are themes she\u2019s been thinking about in advance of a documentary she\u2019s making that will investigate beauty today, including, but not limited to: beauty ideals for trans people, beauty ideals for a generation that\u2019s grown up on Instagram, women in Iran who wear plasters on their nose to pretend they\u2019ve had rhinoplasty, and the exoticism of the Kardashian face, one that draws on black culture but relies on white privilege. She is especially fascinated by the intersection of beauty and science, her predictions occasionally spinning into dystopian places that leave us silent for a second. \u201cThe fact that up to 80% of women in Korea get plastic surgery is interesting, isn\u2019t it? Especially when you start to think about their kids, and the money they\u2019ll spend on their surgery. On shaving their jaws. But then there are developments in genetics, a process of choice now with pregnancy, where you can start to decide what your baby looks like. It\u2019s happening!\u201d Under the table I notice my knee bouncing, a new restlessness, and I am keen, suddenly, to return to subjects like, the best foundations for olive skin. The secret to natural makeup. The perfect red lip.",

Johnson\u2019s comments had the extra irony that Brexit could merely add to that distance.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear what \u201ccommercially viable miniature fusion reactors\u201d the prime minister had in mind.

Experiments at Jet, conducted by all partners within the 28-state <a href=\"https://www.euro-fusion.org/\" title=\"\">Eurofusion</a> consortium, aim to make the nuclear fusion of hydrogen \u2013 the process that powers the sun and other stars \u2013 viable for energy generation by collecting the heat released to drive turbines for electricity. When Jet is running, the temperature inside is more than 100m C, making it \u201cthe hottest place in the solar system\u201d according to CEO of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, Ian Chapman.</p> <p>Nuclear fusion is the merging of atoms. Every atom contains a very dense central blob called the nucleus, made up of particles called protons and neutrons. Atoms of different chemical elements have nuclei with different numbers of protons. If two nuclei collide at high enough energy, they can amalgamate to form a different, heavier element. It requires very high temperatures and densities: inside the sun, temperatures of 10m C or so enable hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium. This process releases energy, which makes the sun shine.</p> <p>Today\u2019s nuclear power plants use not fusion but nuclear fission: the splitting apart of heavy nuclei. This happens spontaneously for radioactive elements such as uranium, and it too releases energy. But both the fuel and the products may remain highly radioactive for very long times \u2013 hundreds of thousands of years \u2013 creating health hazards and waste-disposal problems. What\u2019s more, the fission process, which involves chain reactions that induce fission, can be hard to control and shut down, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster\" title=\"\">Chernobyl</a> and Fukushima disasters, in Ukraine and Japan, showed. Fusion is \u201cnuclear power done right\u201d \u2013 potentially much cleaner, safer and more efficient. \u201cIt seems too good to be true \u2013 high power density, low and manageable waste production, and no possibility of uncontrolled energy release,\u201d says Tim Luce, chief scientist on the large international fusion project Iter, in the south of France. \u201cBut it is true!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"43f21ffcb2f01db1fc4b72611c4ee28a534ffef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43f21ffcb2f01db1fc4b72611c4ee28a534ffef7/0_0_2048_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the tokamak at Culham, Oxfordshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside the tokamak at Culham, Oxfordshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: M Woollard/M.Woollard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since its completion in 1983, Jet has been working towards the holy grail of net energy gain: extracting more from the fusion process than is put in to keep it alive.

The construction of Iter is now nearing completion at Cadarache, near Aix-en-Provence. It hopes to conduct its first experimental runs in 2025, and eventually to produce 500 megawatts (MW) of power \u2013 10 times as much as is needed to operate it. \u201cThe role of Iter is to realise power-plant levels of power and gain, and to begin to address the technological needs of power plants,\u201d says Luce.</p> <p>The fuel used in these and other fusion reactors is not ordinary hydrogen \u2013 the lightest element, with a nucleus containing just one proton \u2013 but heavier hydrogen isotopes called deuterium and tritium, which also have neutrons in their nuclei. The presence of neutrons lets fusion happen under less extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. Deuterium is abundant: it makes up 0.02% of all the natural hydrogen in seawater, from which it can be extracted. But tritium is very rare and radioactive, disintegrating with a half-life of 12 and a quarter years.</p> <p>Tritium can be produced directly at a fusion facility by using the neutrons released as nuclei fuse to break apart lithium atoms, so that a reactor may \u201cbreed\u201d its own fuel. It can also be extracted from heavy (deuterium-rich) water, which is how Jet gets it. But it\u2019s costly, so deuterium-tritium fuel is only used on major test runs. Jet plans to conduct one next year \u2013 the first since the record-breaking demonstration in 1997. \u201cWe remain very optimistic that we\u2019ll break the world record for fusion energy produced,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cEveryone is very excited because we haven\u2019t done it for 20 years.\u201d Iter, meanwhile, hopes to start using deuterium-tritium fuel in 2035.</p> <p>Jet won\u2019t be jeopardised by Brexit. Chapman says that \u201cwe\u2019ve signed a contract to operate Jet to the end of 2020, whatever happens with Brexit.

With a withdrawal agreement, he says, \u201cin principle the UK could stay in Euratom until the end of 2020, and then it\u2019s in an easier position to negotiate for associate membership, as Switzerland already has\u201d. But without one, the UK would need to renegotiate a fresh position in Iter from scratch. That\u2019s possible \u2013 Ukraine has done it \u2013 but Donn\u00e9 says: \u201cIt would take a long time and I don\u2019t know how it would go.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cIn fusion, we have a tradition to work internationally, so it would be a pity if the UK [were to] drop out.\u201d Even if it eventually became possible to rejoin Iter, \u201cBritish industries might lose their chance of orders, and then when the UK comes back in in a few years\u2019 time, maybe all the nice orders will have been given to other companies.\u201d</p> <p>Not everything depends on these big international collaborations, however. The British government has given \u00a3220m to a UK-based project called Step (the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production), which aims to build a working fusion reactor that will feed 100MW into the national grid by 2040. Later phases of the project will be cofunded by industry, and Step\u2019s director Howard Wilson, a physicist at the University of York, says that it will benefit from the work done in parallel at Iter.</p> <p>Step uses a different design from Jet or Iter: the aforementioned spherical tokamak. \u201cRather than a ring doughnut, it looks more like a cored apple,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cThe hole in the middle is much smaller.\u201d This makes the reactor more compact and therefore potentially cheaper (that, perhaps, is what Johnson had in mind when alluding to \u201cminiature\u201d fusion reactors).

      "bodyText": "\u201cThey are on the verge of creating commercially viable miniature fusion reactors for sale around the world,\u201d Boris Johnson told the Conservative party conference earlier this month \u2013 \u201cthey\u201d apparently being UK scientists. It was, at best, a rash promise for how nuclear fusion might make the UK carbon-neutral by the middle of the century \u2013 the target recommended by the Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government. \u201cI know they have been on the verge for some time,\u201d Johnson hedged. \u201cIt is a pretty spacious kind of verge.\u201d But now, he assured his audience, \u201cwe are on the verge of the verge\u201d. It\u2019s a familiar and bitter joke about nuclear fusion as an energy source that, ever since it was first mooted in the 1950s, it has been 30 years away. Johnson\u2019s comments had the extra irony that Brexit could merely add to that distance. It\u2019s not clear what \u201ccommercially viable miniature fusion reactors\u201d the prime minister had in mind. There are no such things either existing or planned at the main centre for fusion research in the UK, the Joint European Torus (Jet) at Culham in Oxfordshire, which Johnson visited in August. Experiments at Jet, conducted by all partners within the 28-state Eurofusion consortium, aim to make the nuclear fusion of hydrogen \u2013 the process that powers the sun and other stars \u2013 viable for energy generation by collecting the heat released to drive turbines for electricity. When Jet is running, the temperature inside is more than 100m C, making it \u201cthe hottest place in the solar system\u201d according to CEO of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, Ian Chapman.

A sudden spike in the number of fatal injuries to horses while racing or training there in the first six months of the year placed welfare standards at the track \u2013 and by extension, in American racing as a whole \u2013 at the centre of unprecedented, unrelenting media scrutiny.</p> <p>As news of fatalities arrived with grim regularity through January, February and March, Santa Anita\u2019s management seemed to be struggling to cope with the unfolding catastrophe. Many possible reasons were suggested for the sudden surge, including a deteriorating track after an unusually wet and cold winter; the ubiquity of race-day drugs in US racing and their potential role in masking underlying physical issues; and sheer bad luck.

Two of the 889 starters on 15 cards have suffered fatal injuries, a rate of 0.22%, which is very close to that in British racing. Two more have died after suffering injuries while training. Meanwhile, down by the Pacific coast at Del Mar near San Diego \u2013 where \u201cthe surf meets the turf\u201d \u2013 the entire 36-day summer meet was run with the same new procedures and passed without a fatal injury.</p> <p>But still the sense remains that Santa Anita, one of racing\u2019s most precious jewels, is one primetime catastrophe away from a return to the misery and uncertainty of the first half of the year.

In 2009, the last full year Santa Anita raced on a synthetic surface, the fatality rate was 0.84 per 1,000 starts.

      "bodyText": "On 18 October 1973, I had a bet on a horse at a racecourse for the first time. Well, strictly speaking, my dad backed the horse for me, as I was eight years old at the time. Moolahs Memory was an 80-1 outsider and ran like it, though he did beat one of his 11 opponents to the wire. A couple of races later, I picked out another outsider, Kings Flier. He sounded fast \u2013 and finished second. The place payoff at 13-1 meant I left the course feeling rich beyond dreams. In hindsight, it was perhaps a more formative moment than it might have seemed at the time. I never forgot the name of either horse, which is why I can be so sure of the date. When my job took me back to the same track 39 years later, there they were in the official form book, on a Thursday afternoon at the fall meet in 1973. My memory was spot on about the $13 payoff, too. You read that right: \u201cfall\u201d and \u201cdollars\u201d. The track was Santa Anita in California, a place once experienced is almost impossible to forget. Even now, nearly half a century on, I can vividly recall the looming backdrop of the San Gabriel mountains, the palm trees, the hustle of the cavernous betting hall underneath the magnificent main stand and a bugler in a huntsman\u2019s jacket tooting Reveille before every race.

But by 2018 Day of the Dead received 9.5% more mentions than Halloween. \u201cI don\u2019t think the next generation of Mexicans will celebrate Halloween,\u201d said Humberto Polar, president of Grey Mexico, an ad agency. \u201cIt\u2019s a holiday that\u2019s fading away.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2019 to correct the spelling of Oaxaca state.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cYo, it\u2019s the hyperman set, AJ Tracey, live and direct!\u201d Roll down a car window or scroll the radio dial over the past few months and Ladbroke Grove, the no-frills garage tune by the west London rapper, will have no doubt been making the speakers shake. Tracey\u2019s track, with its pitched-up sample from soul singer Jorja Smith, cut through all the season\u2019s Latin-flavoured pop, functional house and endless Ed Sheeran singles and still sits, unbudged, in the charts, a feelgood summer hit that refuses to accept that autumn is here.</p> <p>Tracey, whose real name is Ch\u00e9 (after Guevara) Wolton Grant, though he usually goes by his stage name, has been having a breakthrough year. In February, he self-released his debut album, which has since become the second-biggest album of 2019 by an independent musician; to cap it off, he\u2019s playing two sold-out nights at the 10,000-capacity venue Alexandra Palace next month.</p> <p>Unlike many of his peers, who are at the beck and call of a major label, Tracey is used to calling the shots. \u201cI can do whatever the hell I want,\u201d he tells me. It\u2019s a lot of pressure, doing shows that big, but he doesn\u2019t get nervous, he says \u2013 or at least you can\u2019t tell. \u201cI\u2019m the least animated person I know,\u201d he quips during our photoshoot. \u201cEven on stage\u201d, he says: \u201cI just walk across it.\u201d</p> <p>That isn\u2019t entirely true. Tracey is celebrated for the rapid-fire displays of his vocals and his versatility, flipping between the various styles that are defining UK music right now: grime, trap, drill, anything lightly syncopated \u2013 no genre has gone unturned. Until 2019, however, the 25-year-old watched as his peers raced ahead. He\u2019d been grafting for years on the underground, working largely within grime music, releasing a string of well-received EPs, featuring on songs by American rappers such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxVqBeF9kYg\" title=\"\">A$AP Rocky</a> and collaborating with his mate Dave, on the 2016 track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQTsZGvVUbs\" title=\"\">Thiago Silva</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile Stormzy, who started releasing music after Tracey did, has become a national treasure, with the kind of cultural weight that led <em>Time</em> magazine to put him on its October <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/10/stormzy-makes-cover-of-time-magazine-as-next-generation-leader-great-thunberg-annual-list\" title=\"\">cover </a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dave\" title=\"\">Dave</a> won this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/19/dave-wins-mercury-prize-2019-album-psychodrama\" title=\"\">Mercury music prize</a> for his debut album <em>Psychodrama</em>, and stars in the new series of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/31/ronan-bennett-top-boy-series-three-interview-netflix-drake\" title=\"\">Top Boy</a></em>, alongside rising London rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/31/little-simz-interview-top-boy-new-series-netflix-drake\" title=\"\">Little Simz</a> and grime veteran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kano\" title=\"\">Kano</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQTsZGvVUbs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OQTsZGvVUbs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OQTsZGvVUbs\">Tiago Silva, performed by Dave and AJ Tracey</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Because of illness, Tracey also missed out at this year\u2019s Glastonbury. During Stormzy\u2019s Saturday headline gig, Tracey\u2019s was the first name to be mentioned in the rapper\u2019s celebratory roll-call of British MCs. But the next day, when Dave performed Thiago Silva, he plucked bucket-hatted teenager <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1vlLJCr9Lo\" title=\"\">Alex Mann</a> from the crowd to rap Tracey\u2019s part, which promptly went viral. The Mann video drew some criticism for pushing the focus on to a young white guy instead of a black artist, but it also underlined how grime had gone from gritty underground subculture to the unequivocal sound of the suburbs. And it cemented Thiago Silva as one of the most memorable duets of the decade. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll say it, yeah, I think it\u2019s the greatest grime song ever,\u201d says Tracey.</p> <p>On the one hand, Tracey fires off boasts like a bazooka. His album cover, which pictured him dejectedly cradling a goat, may have seemed like an oddball choice, except \u201cGOAT\u201d is an internet acronym for Greatest of All Time. I\u2019ve read about journalists having to interview him at home while he plays video games, but he says now that he has trouble concentrating - he\u2019s fun to be around and a little mischievous (he says one minute that he doesn\u2019t judge anyone and then calls an anonymous rapper \u201ctrash\u201d). He is tall and smells expensive (it\u2019s Dior Eau Sauvage), dressed in designer tracksuit bottoms, his afro tucked scruffily under a baseball cap, a style he calls a \u201clittle weird\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Stormzy ran for prime minister, he\u2019d stand a chance of winning, I swear to God</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Behind the bravado, though, Tracey hints at having struggled to find his moment. \u201cPeople would never have expected Ladbroke Grove to be in the top five for 10 weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s, like, power numbers! I feel like the type of music I\u2019m making and who I am, people expect me to do well, but not be in the main spotlight. And now that I am, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh! What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s going on is that since grime \u2013 the urgent, inner-city rap/electronic hybrid that evolved out of UK garage in the early 00s \u2013 bounced back in 2014, the landscape of British pop has shifted dramatically.</p> <p>Look over the top 40 songs of the summer and it encompasses a variety of MC-led sounds that grime paved the way for but which, except perhaps for some similar slang, are wildly different. There\u2019s the seductive syncopation of UK Afrobeats, which amalgamates dancehall, African pop melodies and R&amp;B, or the adjacent sound, Afro-swing, spearheaded by Mercury-nominated rapper J-Hus. The harder-edged road rap, meanwhile, emerged when grime fell out of favour, and a more recent development is drill, a nihilistic offshoot of trap that began in Chicago and transferred to London estates.</p> <p>Stormzy told <em>Time</em> magazine that the reason he did the Glasto roll-call was because of a \u201chistorical thing of letting [only] one black person in at a time\u201d to the mainstream \u2013 now there are countless MCs commanding attention. Grime, for example, was called \u201cone of our most successful musical exports\u201d in a 2019 report from a UK parliamentary committee, which would have been unheard of in the days of its early stars, Wiley and Dizzee Rascal. Also unheard of would have been Tracey\u2019s forthcoming Ally Pally appearance or Kano\u2019s recent, triumphant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/12/kano-live-royal-albert-hall-review\" title=\"\">homecoming</a> at the Royal Albert Hall.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen MC-led music and culture have such a lasting impact on mainstream music,\u201d says Safiya Lambie-Knight, who works in artist and label marketing, Urban UK at Spotify. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a time like it before.\u201d She says that as \u201cmore doors have been opened\u201d via the success of artists such as Stormzy and Skepta, who both released their albums independently, it\u2019s allowed other artists to \u201ccarve their own names in this world, without necessarily having to be a grime artist\u201d.</p> <p>Tracey is different in that he has scooped up these many-tentacled styles in his musically omnivorous net. His album spans soca, drill, UK rap, various cap-tips to American trap and sad-rap and even a strum-tastic song called Country Star. (Tracey says he had originally tried to get Billy Ray Cyrus to appear on it, which maybe gave the US crooner the idea to join Lil Nas X\u2019s super-smash <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ae5Ap77b7k\" title=\"\">Old Town Road</a>.) With Ladbroke Grove, too, Tracey was keen to do something with undeniable crossover appeal. Bigging up one\u2019s \u201cends\u201d has always been a cornerstone of grime\u2019s lyrical content, but here was AJ putting it on a clubby beat with a video shot with some camels in Marrakech. \u201cI wanted to make it for the mums, the nans, the dads, their kids. I wanted it to be a song for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>For some, this move away from his roots was confusing, especially as he told <em>Esquire</em> earlier this year: \u201cJust don\u2019t call me a grime rapper.\u201d But even his earlier tracks such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBND5nKfj5Q\" title=\"\">Spirit Bomb</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9-9GWFuS5w\" title=\"\">Buster Cannon</a>, he says, used trap beats. \u201cI never felt like I was in the grime scene,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI was the outsider. So when I veered away from it, I didn\u2019t feel like I was leaving the circle \u2013 I felt like I was never in it.\u201d He says that many of the grime originators who were around during the genre\u2019s inception weren\u2019t interested in giving him a leg up. \u201cNo one paid me any attention,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to do everything on my own.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Q40kOt9X0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r_Q40kOt9X0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/r_Q40kOt9X0\">AJ Tracey\u2019s single Ladbroke Grove</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Stormzy, however, has been a key mentor: \u201cHe\u2019s given me so much good advice. He comes and collects me, we drive around, and he says, \u2018Listen, the more popular you get, the more people gonna hate on you for reasons that are non-existent.\u2019 He told me, \u2018Bro, ignore them, they don\u2019t mean anything.\u2019 When you\u2019re sitting there thinking, \u2018Why did these guys hate me? Why did they think my new song\u2019s shit?\u2019, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>Tracey puts his eclecticism down to his Welsh single mother, whom he holds in the highest regard. A former pirate radio DJ, she used to play him dancehall, rap, garage, jungle and house, he says, in their home on the Sutton estate in North Kensington. He honed his speedy rapping skills over his mother\u2019s drum\u2019n\u2019bass records, which are far faster than your average rap or grime tune. \u201cIt\u2019s like when footballers run underwater in water tanks,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere\u2019s a high pressure against your body. If you can run fast in a water tank, when they take you out of the water, you can run way faster because there\u2019s less pressure. I used to go on to radio sets and be spraying so fast, people would be like, \u2018How are you doing that?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His Trinidadian father, meanwhile, who moved out when Tracey was six, had been in a UK hip-hop group in the 90s, which Tracey has always refused to identify. He taught his son how to write lyrics but also about \u201cthe dilemmas of being black, which my mum can\u2019t teach me,\u201d says Tracey. \u201cSome things you never really fully understand unless you are actually black and you experience how it feels when someone treats you differently based on your skin colour.\u201d But he encountered prejudice of another kind too. The estate he lived on was largely white and as a mixed-race kid, he says, \u201cI feel like I was more accepted by the white community than the black [one]. A lot of the time, the black kids would be like, \u2018Oh, \u2019cause you lighter, you\u2019re not as \u201cgang\u201d as us. That\u2019s really the attitude they have. It made me misbehave more because I felt like I had to prove a point.\u201d</p> <p>He sold drugs for a while, nothing heavy. \u201cEveryone did that,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s bog-standard. White kids from good homes sell drugs. I just did what I had to do because we didn\u2019t have enough money. I stopped as soon as I had enough to survive.\u201d His mum \u201cdidn\u2019t even know\u201d about his extracurricular exploits \u201cuntil she heard my lyrics\u201d. He was a smart kid, and briefly studied criminology at London Metropolitan University before dropping out to focus on music.</p> <p>When he first started rapping, Tracey says many of his lyrics reflected his frustration at his social situation. \u201cI was very angry: angry at society, angry at life, angry at everything,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing a black youth in London is very hard and it\u2019s not fair. Why is it that I have to pay this much for school uniform when my mum can\u2019t afford it? Why is it that the government doesn\u2019t help? Why is my rent so high? That\u2019s how I was feeling, so all my music sounded very aggressive, violent, angry, all these negative things.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6dde699eee8e9442e419fee24f2fcaf965bc9940\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dde699eee8e9442e419fee24f2fcaf965bc9940/0_42_4575_2793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AJ Tracey on stage during Leeds Festival 2019 at Bramham Park on August 25, 2019 in Leeds, England.

Between 2012 and 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/31/slashing-youth-services-tories-betrayed-generation-labour-legal-requirement\" title=\"\">600 youth clubs shut down </a>across the country, and a parliamentary committee in May this year found that more than 100 councils had slashed their budget for youth services by 91%. Such budget cuts, they said, could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/07/youth-club-closures-young-people-risk-violence-mps\" title=\"\">linked to the rise in knife crime</a>, which is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/04/knife-attacks-teenagers-figures-east-london-manchester\" title=\"\"> up 93% in five years</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a connection,\u201d says Tracey. He explains that his mum was \u201calways cool with my friends chilling in my house \u2013 she knows it\u2019s much better for us to be in the house smoking weed [because] it\u2019s safe rather than being on the street, [with] police stopping us, harassing us [or] maybe we get into some sort of gang altercation\u201d. But he says that \u201ca lot of people don\u2019t have that\u201d and so youth clubs provide a \u201csafe haven for kids to hang out in\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not my job to tell people how\u00a0to conduct their lives \u2013 it\u2019s\u00a0not\u00a0that straightforward</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo solve the knife problem,\u201d he continues, \u201cyou need to uplift the youth \u2013 guide them and help them. Give them a purpose. Taking away the youth clubs and places for them to hang out means, obviously, they\u2019re going to be on [the] road now [where] there\u2019s friction, there\u2019s problems, there\u2019s postcode gangs, there\u2019s drugs.\u201d Shutting down those safe havens, he continues, is \u201cobviously encouraging this beef\u201d and \u201cmaking it worse \u2013 but the government is never going to listen to that\u201d.</p> <p>While Tracey often addresses such complex subjects in conversation he has mostly swerved them in song, unlike many of his contemporaries. Dave\u2019s song Question Time, which confronted the Tories about their litany of incompetence, won an Ivor Novello award in 2018, while Tracey\u2019s cousin, the rapper Big Zuu, released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE0HbGorZmE\" title=\"\">Grenfell tribute</a>.</p> <p>The Grenfell tragedy in particular hit Tracey hard. \u201cMy friend and his whole family died in that fire,\u201d he says, \u201cso that\u2019s very close to my heart. We can see Grenfell from my mum\u2019s front room window.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t feel the need to refer to it in his music. \u201cWhatever I need to do to help in that situation I will do, but I don\u2019t need to promote it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be a PR stunt. That\u2019s not a shot at anyone, but I deal with it in my own way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aea2fc0da4bcabed724cafac2961b82ecea2b345\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aea2fc0da4bcabed724cafac2961b82ecea2b345/281_1186_5263_5052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AJ TraceyRapper AJ Tracey photographed for the Observer New Review in London October 2019 by Pal Hansen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"960\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m proud of myself.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, Tracey\u2019s music majors in braggadocio and smutty bombast, with zingers such as \u201cI\u2019m young, rich and hung\u201d (Wifey Riddim 3) and tales about, well, chasing tail. \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself, man,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople used to always tell me to stop gloating but I have the right to gloat, I deserve to talk about my achievements. They could call me boastful. I am boastful.\u201d Any songs detailing his sexual encounters with women, he continues, are just him speaking his \u201ctruth\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf a woman [has] shared her body with me, why can I not speak of my experience?\u201d he says, a little defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s not me casting a judgment on someone, it\u2019s something that has happened. You can rap about whatever the hell you wanna rap about \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019re rappers. You can have an opinion against it but you can\u2019t tell me not to do it. At the end of the day, that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d</p> <p>Genres such as drill are increasingly popular but they are still demonised in the media and Tracey says that he wanted to present an image of young black youth that was more carefree and fun. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be that source of release,\u201d he says. \u201cMy music, it\u2019s escapism.\u201d He says he used to be very angry (\u201cat life, at society, at... just everything\u201d) but doesn\u2019t feel that any more, not least because he\u2019s upgraded to a nice apartment in Chelsea \u201cwith glass all around it \u2013 there\u2019s flowers in my house, I read cook books. I\u2019ve got a painting of Fidel Castro on my wall and I play <em>Fortnite</em> every day. So I\u2019m not going to be rapping about that [his old life] \u2019cause it\u2019s not what I live.\u201d</p> <p>He is, however, pragmatic about being a role model. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job to be telling people how to conduct their lives: \u2018Youth, you should put your knives down\u2019; \u2018Youth, you should do this, do that\u2019\u2019\u2026 I understand the complexities of all the struggles the youth go through and I don\u2019t have the right to tell them, \u2018Don\u2019t roll with a weapon\u2019, because [then] they might not roll with a weapon, and they might meet someone who doesn\u2019t like them, and they might lose their life because they didn\u2019t have a weapon on them. It\u2019s not as straightforward as people think it is.\u201d Instead, he\u2019d rather lead by example. \u201cI have loads of kids who copy what I do. So if I do stupid things and they go and do it, I\u2019m letting them down.\u201d</p> <p>The next album he makes will be more \u201cconscious\u201d, he continues, although he adds that he doesn\u2019t actually enjoy talking about politics, as \u201ceverything that\u2019s said can be twisted\u201d. In June 2017, when the last general election was reaching peak mayhem, there was a grime pile-on of support for Jeremy Corbyn on Twitter (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/13/corbyn-grime-stars-labour-grime4corbyn-awate-maxsta-krucial-slix\" title=\"\">#grime4corbyn</a>). It helped to create a \u201cyouthquake\u201d, encouraging the largest number of young voters in the country since 1992. Tracey went one step further and appeared in an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10154553454582411\" title=\"\">official UK Labour video</a>, filmed in Ladbroke Grove, saying that the party could \u201cgive young people hope\u201d. At the beginning of the clip, there\u2019s a glimpse of Grenfell, which went up in flames the following year.</p> <p>What motivated him, at the time, to do the video for Team Corbyn? \u201cI dunno, man,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like he was the best of a bad bunch.\u201d He thought that voting for Labour was \u201cthe only way\u201d to shift the government \u201cover to the fair side a bit\u201d. The #grime4corbyn campaign he says was \u201cvery cheesy\u201d, but even though it helped to mobilise a generation, he is disappointed about its outcome. \u201cIt actually helped him a lot and I feel like he didn\u2019t capitalise on it,\u201d says Tracey of the Labour leader. \u201cHe didn\u2019t utilise what he had.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1vlLJCr9Lo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e1vlLJCr9Lo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/e1vlLJCr9Lo\">Glastonbury 2019, when teenage fan Alex Mann was pulled from the crowd to take AJ Tracey\u2019s part in performing Thiago Silva with Dave</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The video has left a faintly bitter taste but, if it came to it, with a quick election looking ever more likely, Tracey would do it again. \u201cNot for Labour, though,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I\u2019m voting for anyone now it\u2019s the Green party. Corbyn is a great guy and his morals are in the right place but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s strong enough to be our leader.\u201d And the less said about Boris, the better. \u201cHe\u2019s just an idiot, innit,\u201d says Tracey. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to be the big man, but he\u2019s a very small man.\u201d</p> <p>Could British MCs get together and galvanise young people again in that way? \u201cStormzy could make everyone mobilise,\u201d says Tracey. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy that could do it. If Stormzy ran for prime minister, he\u2019d stand a chance of winning, I swear to God.\u201d</p> <p>And if he was in charge himself? The first thing he\u2019d do is \u201ctackle climate change, hard\u201d, he says. \u201cI\u2019d put a massive tax on cars that aren\u2019t eco-friendly and I\u2019d do some kind of initiative where you can come and get your car scrapped and maybe get free travel in exchange.\u201d</p> <p>For now, at least, the latter might be achievable. Tracey says he isn\u2019t so bothered about courting the US music industry \u2013 his focus is on his home turf. \u201cI haven\u2019t conquered the UK yet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I have, then we\u2019ll talk about America.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, there are those two massive sell-out gigs to contend with, which led him to jokingly tweet recently: \u201cCan I come to someone\u2019s house for dinner tonight, I spent all my money on Ally Pally production?\u201d</p> <p>These are the little-shown downsides of being a modern-day independent artist, but Tracey remains philosophical. \u201cI\u2019m going minus [figures] for these shows,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to invest in myself, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p> <p><em>With thanks to <a href=\"https://www.keystonecrescent.com/\" title=\"\">Keystone Crescent members bar, King\u2019s Cross</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u201cYo, it\u2019s the hyperman set, AJ Tracey, live and direct!\u201d Roll down a car window or scroll the radio dial over the past few months and Ladbroke Grove, the no-frills garage tune by the west London rapper, will have no doubt been making the speakers shake. Tracey\u2019s track, with its pitched-up sample from soul singer Jorja Smith, cut through all the season\u2019s Latin-flavoured pop, functional house and endless Ed Sheeran singles and still sits, unbudged, in the charts, a feelgood summer hit that refuses to accept that autumn is here. Tracey, whose real name is Ch\u00e9 (after Guevara) Wolton Grant, though he usually goes by his stage name, has been having a breakthrough year. In February, he self-released his debut album, which has since become the second-biggest album of 2019 by an independent musician; to cap it off, he\u2019s playing two sold-out nights at the 10,000-capacity venue Alexandra Palace next month. Unlike many of his peers, who are at the beck and call of a major label, Tracey is used to calling the shots. \u201cI can do whatever the hell I want,\u201d he tells me. It\u2019s a lot of pressure, doing shows that big, but he doesn\u2019t get nervous, he says \u2013 or at least you can\u2019t tell. \u201cI\u2019m the least animated person I know,\u201d he quips during our photoshoot. \u201cEven on stage\u201d, he says: \u201cI just walk across it.\u201d That isn\u2019t entirely true. Tracey is celebrated for the rapid-fire displays of his vocals and his versatility, flipping between the various styles that are defining UK music right now: grime, trap, drill, anything lightly syncopated \u2013 no genre has gone unturned. Until 2019, however, the 25-year-old watched as his peers raced ahead. He\u2019d been grafting for years on the underground, working largely within grime music, releasing a string of well-received EPs, featuring on songs by American rappers such as A$AP Rocky and collaborating with his mate Dave, on the 2016 track Thiago Silva. Meanwhile Stormzy, who started releasing music after Tracey did, has become a national treasure, with the kind of cultural weight that led Time magazine to put him on its October cover . Dave won this year\u2019s Mercury music prize for his debut album Psychodrama, and stars in the new series of Top Boy, alongside rising London rapper Little Simz and grime veteran Kano. Because of illness, Tracey also missed out at this year\u2019s Glastonbury. During Stormzy\u2019s Saturday headline gig, Tracey\u2019s was the first name to be mentioned in the rapper\u2019s celebratory roll-call of British MCs. But the next day, when Dave performed Thiago Silva, he plucked bucket-hatted teenager Alex Mann from the crowd to rap Tracey\u2019s part, which promptly went viral. The Mann video drew some criticism for pushing the focus on to a young white guy instead of a black artist, but it also underlined how grime had gone from gritty underground subculture to the unequivocal sound of the suburbs. And it cemented Thiago Silva as one of the most memorable duets of the decade. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll say it, yeah, I think it\u2019s the greatest grime song ever,\u201d says Tracey. On the one hand, Tracey fires off boasts like a bazooka. His album cover, which pictured him dejectedly cradling a goat, may have seemed like an oddball choice, except \u201cGOAT\u201d is an internet acronym for Greatest of All Time. I\u2019ve read about journalists having to interview him at home while he plays video games, but he says now that he has trouble concentrating - he\u2019s fun to be around and a little mischievous (he says one minute that he doesn\u2019t judge anyone and then calls an anonymous rapper \u201ctrash\u201d). He is tall and smells expensive (it\u2019s Dior Eau Sauvage), dressed in designer tracksuit bottoms, his afro tucked scruffily under a baseball cap, a style he calls a \u201clittle weird\u201d. Behind the bravado, though, Tracey hints at having struggled to find his moment. \u201cPeople would never have expected Ladbroke Grove to be in the top five for 10 weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s, like, power numbers! I feel like the type of music I\u2019m making and who I am, people expect me to do well, but not be in the main spotlight. And now that I am, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh! What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d What\u2019s going on is that since grime \u2013 the urgent, inner-city rap/electronic hybrid that evolved out of UK garage in the early 00s \u2013 bounced back in 2014, the landscape of British pop has shifted dramatically. Look over the top 40 songs of the summer and it encompasses a variety of MC-led sounds that grime paved the way for but which, except perhaps for some similar slang, are wildly different. There\u2019s the seductive syncopation of UK Afrobeats, which amalgamates dancehall, African pop melodies and R&amp;B, or the adjacent sound, Afro-swing, spearheaded by Mercury-nominated rapper J-Hus. The harder-edged road rap, meanwhile, emerged when grime fell out of favour, and a more recent development is drill, a nihilistic offshoot of trap that began in Chicago and transferred to London estates. Stormzy told Time magazine that the reason he did the Glasto roll-call was because of a \u201chistorical thing of letting [only] one black person in at a time\u201d to the mainstream \u2013 now there are countless MCs commanding attention. Grime, for example, was called \u201cone of our most successful musical exports\u201d in a 2019 report from a UK parliamentary committee, which would have been unheard of in the days of its early stars, Wiley and Dizzee Rascal. Also unheard of would have been Tracey\u2019s forthcoming Ally Pally appearance or Kano\u2019s recent, triumphant homecoming at the Royal Albert Hall. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen MC-led music and culture have such a lasting impact on mainstream music,\u201d says Safiya Lambie-Knight, who works in artist and label marketing, Urban UK at Spotify. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a time like it before.\u201d She says that as \u201cmore doors have been opened\u201d via the success of artists such as Stormzy and Skepta, who both released their albums independently, it\u2019s allowed other artists to \u201ccarve their own names in this world, without necessarily having to be a grime artist\u201d. Tracey is different in that he has scooped up these many-tentacled styles in his musically omnivorous net. His album spans soca, drill, UK rap, various cap-tips to American trap and sad-rap and even a strum-tastic song called Country Star. (Tracey says he had originally tried to get Billy Ray Cyrus to appear on it, which maybe gave the US crooner the idea to join Lil Nas X\u2019s super-smash Old Town Road.) With Ladbroke Grove, too, Tracey was keen to do something with undeniable crossover appeal. Bigging up one\u2019s \u201cends\u201d has always been a cornerstone of grime\u2019s lyrical content, but here was AJ putting it on a clubby beat with a video shot with some camels in Marrakech. \u201cI wanted to make it for the mums, the nans, the dads, their kids. I wanted it to be a song for everyone.\u201d For some, this move away from his roots was confusing, especially as he told Esquire earlier this year: \u201cJust don\u2019t call me a grime rapper.\u201d But even his earlier tracks such as Spirit Bomb and Buster Cannon, he says, used trap beats. \u201cI never felt like I was in the grime scene,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI was the outsider. So when I veered away from it, I didn\u2019t feel like I was leaving the circle \u2013 I felt like I was never in it.\u201d He says that many of the grime originators who were around during the genre\u2019s inception weren\u2019t interested in giving him a leg up. \u201cNo one paid me any attention,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to do everything on my own.\u201d Stormzy, however, has been a key mentor: \u201cHe\u2019s given me so much good advice. He comes and collects me, we drive around, and he says, \u2018Listen, the more popular you get, the more people gonna hate on you for reasons that are non-existent.\u2019 He told me, \u2018Bro, ignore them, they don\u2019t mean anything.\u2019 When you\u2019re sitting there thinking, \u2018Why did these guys hate me? Why did they think my new song\u2019s shit?\u2019, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Tracey puts his eclecticism down to his Welsh single mother, whom he holds in the highest regard. A former pirate radio DJ, she used to play him dancehall, rap, garage, jungle and house, he says, in their home on the Sutton estate in North Kensington. He honed his speedy rapping skills over his mother\u2019s drum\u2019n\u2019bass records, which are far faster than your average rap or grime tune. \u201cIt\u2019s like when footballers run underwater in water tanks,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere\u2019s a high pressure against your body. If you can run fast in a water tank, when they take you out of the water, you can run way faster because there\u2019s less pressure. I used to go on to radio sets and be spraying so fast, people would be like, \u2018How are you doing that?\u2019\u201d His Trinidadian father, meanwhile, who moved out when Tracey was six, had been in a UK hip-hop group in the 90s, which Tracey has always refused to identify. He taught his son how to write lyrics but also about \u201cthe dilemmas of being black, which my mum can\u2019t teach me,\u201d says Tracey. \u201cSome things you never really fully understand unless you are actually black and you experience how it feels when someone treats you differently based on your skin colour.\u201d But he encountered prejudice of another kind too. The estate he lived on was largely white and as a mixed-race kid, he says, \u201cI feel like I was more accepted by the white community than the black [one]. A lot of the time, the black kids would be like, \u2018Oh, \u2019cause you lighter, you\u2019re not as \u201cgang\u201d as us. That\u2019s really the attitude they have. It made me misbehave more because I felt like I had to prove a point.\u201d He sold drugs for a while, nothing heavy. \u201cEveryone did that,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s bog-standard. White kids from good homes sell drugs. I just did what I had to do because we didn\u2019t have enough money. I stopped as soon as I had enough to survive.\u201d His mum \u201cdidn\u2019t even know\u201d about his extracurricular exploits \u201cuntil she heard my lyrics\u201d. He was a smart kid, and briefly studied criminology at London Metropolitan University before dropping out to focus on music. When he first started rapping, Tracey says many of his lyrics reflected his frustration at his social situation. \u201cI was very angry: angry at society, angry at life, angry at everything,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing a black youth in London is very hard and it\u2019s not fair. Why is it that I have to pay this much for school uniform when my mum can\u2019t afford it? Why is it that the government doesn\u2019t help? Why is my rent so high? That\u2019s how I was feeling, so all my music sounded very aggressive, violent, angry, all these negative things.\u201d \u201cThe government should be putting things in place to help young people of colour,\u201d he says, \u201clike youth clubs.\u201d He is passionate on this subject; his mother, a youth worker, ran the club on his estate but spaces like those are in steep decline. Between 2012 and 2016, 600 youth clubs shut down across the country, and a parliamentary committee in May this year found that more than 100 councils had slashed their budget for youth services by 91%. Such budget cuts, they said, could be linked to the rise in knife crime, which is up 93% in five years. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a connection,\u201d says Tracey. He explains that his mum was \u201calways cool with my friends chilling in my house \u2013 she knows it\u2019s much better for us to be in the house smoking weed [because] it\u2019s safe rather than being on the street, [with] police stopping us, harassing us [or] maybe we get into some sort of gang altercation\u201d. But he says that \u201ca lot of people don\u2019t have that\u201d and so youth clubs provide a \u201csafe haven for kids to hang out in\u201d. \u201cTo solve the knife problem,\u201d he continues, \u201cyou need to uplift the youth \u2013 guide them and help them. Give them a purpose. Taking away the youth clubs and places for them to hang out means, obviously, they\u2019re going to be on [the] road now [where] there\u2019s friction, there\u2019s problems, there\u2019s postcode gangs, there\u2019s drugs.\u201d Shutting down those safe havens, he continues, is \u201cobviously encouraging this beef\u201d and \u201cmaking it worse \u2013 but the government is never going to listen to that\u201d. While Tracey often addresses such complex subjects in conversation he has mostly swerved them in song, unlike many of his contemporaries. Dave\u2019s song Question Time, which confronted the Tories about their litany of incompetence, won an Ivor Novello award in 2018, while Tracey\u2019s cousin, the rapper Big Zuu, released a Grenfell tribute. The Grenfell tragedy in particular hit Tracey hard. \u201cMy friend and his whole family died in that fire,\u201d he says, \u201cso that\u2019s very close to my heart. We can see Grenfell from my mum\u2019s front room window.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t feel the need to refer to it in his music. \u201cWhatever I need to do to help in that situation I will do, but I don\u2019t need to promote it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be a PR stunt. That\u2019s not a shot at anyone, but I deal with it in my own way.\u201d Instead, Tracey\u2019s music majors in braggadocio and smutty bombast, with zingers such as \u201cI\u2019m young, rich and hung\u201d (Wifey Riddim 3) and tales about, well, chasing tail. \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself, man,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople used to always tell me to stop gloating but I have the right to gloat, I deserve to talk about my achievements. They could call me boastful. I am boastful.\u201d Any songs detailing his sexual encounters with women, he continues, are just him speaking his \u201ctruth\u201d. \u201cIf a woman [has] shared her body with me, why can I not speak of my experience?\u201d he says, a little defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s not me casting a judgment on someone, it\u2019s something that has happened. You can rap about whatever the hell you wanna rap about \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019re rappers. You can have an opinion against it but you can\u2019t tell me not to do it. At the end of the day, that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d Genres such as drill are increasingly popular but they are still demonised in the media and Tracey says that he wanted to present an image of young black youth that was more carefree and fun. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be that source of release,\u201d he says. \u201cMy music, it\u2019s escapism.\u201d He says he used to be very angry (\u201cat life, at society, at... just everything\u201d) but doesn\u2019t feel that any more, not least because he\u2019s upgraded to a nice apartment in Chelsea \u201cwith glass all around it \u2013 there\u2019s flowers in my house, I read cook books. I\u2019ve got a painting of Fidel Castro on my wall and I play Fortnite every day. So I\u2019m not going to be rapping about that [his old life] \u2019cause it\u2019s not what I live.\u201d He is, however, pragmatic about being a role model. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job to be telling people how to conduct their lives: \u2018Youth, you should put your knives down\u2019; \u2018Youth, you should do this, do that\u2019\u2019\u2026 I understand the complexities of all the struggles the youth go through and I don\u2019t have the right to tell them, \u2018Don\u2019t roll with a weapon\u2019, because [then] they might not roll with a weapon, and they might meet someone who doesn\u2019t like them, and they might lose their life because they didn\u2019t have a weapon on them. It\u2019s not as straightforward as people think it is.\u201d Instead, he\u2019d rather lead by example. \u201cI have loads of kids who copy what I do. So if I do stupid things and they go and do it, I\u2019m letting them down.\u201d The next album he makes will be more \u201cconscious\u201d, he continues, although he adds that he doesn\u2019t actually enjoy talking about politics, as \u201ceverything that\u2019s said can be twisted\u201d. In June 2017, when the last general election was reaching peak mayhem, there was a grime pile-on of support for Jeremy Corbyn on Twitter (#grime4corbyn). It helped to create a \u201cyouthquake\u201d, encouraging the largest number of young voters in the country since 1992. Tracey went one step further and appeared in an official UK Labour video, filmed in Ladbroke Grove, saying that the party could \u201cgive young people hope\u201d. At the beginning of the clip, there\u2019s a glimpse of Grenfell, which went up in flames the following year. What motivated him, at the time, to do the video for Team Corbyn? \u201cI dunno, man,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like he was the best of a bad bunch.\u201d He thought that voting for Labour was \u201cthe only way\u201d to shift the government \u201cover to the fair side a bit\u201d. The #grime4corbyn campaign he says was \u201cvery cheesy\u201d, but even though it helped to mobilise a generation, he is disappointed about its outcome. \u201cIt actually helped him a lot and I feel like he didn\u2019t capitalise on it,\u201d says Tracey of the Labour leader. \u201cHe didn\u2019t utilise what he had.\u201d The video has left a faintly bitter taste but, if it came to it, with a quick election looking ever more likely, Tracey would do it again. \u201cNot for Labour, though,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I\u2019m voting for anyone now it\u2019s the Green party. Corbyn is a great guy and his morals are in the right place but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s strong enough to be our leader.\u201d And the less said about Boris, the better. \u201cHe\u2019s just an idiot, innit,\u201d says Tracey. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to be the big man, but he\u2019s a very small man.\u201d Could British MCs get together and galvanise young people again in that way? \u201cStormzy could make everyone mobilise,\u201d says Tracey. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy that could do it. If Stormzy ran for prime minister, he\u2019d stand a chance of winning, I swear to God.\u201d And if he was in charge himself? The first thing he\u2019d do is \u201ctackle climate change, hard\u201d, he says. \u201cI\u2019d put a massive tax on cars that aren\u2019t eco-friendly and I\u2019d do some kind of initiative where you can come and get your car scrapped and maybe get free travel in exchange.\u201d For now, at least, the latter might be achievable. Tracey says he isn\u2019t so bothered about courting the US music industry \u2013 his focus is on his home turf. \u201cI haven\u2019t conquered the UK yet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I have, then we\u2019ll talk about America.\u201d In the meantime, there are those two massive sell-out gigs to contend with, which led him to jokingly tweet recently: \u201cCan I come to someone\u2019s house for dinner tonight, I spent all my money on Ally Pally production?\u201d These are the little-shown downsides of being a modern-day independent artist, but Tracey remains philosophical. \u201cI\u2019m going minus [figures] for these shows,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got to invest in myself, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d With thanks to Keystone Crescent members bar, King\u2019s Cross. AJ Tracey plays Alexandra Palace, London N22 on 8 and 9 November. A deluxe version of his album, AJ Tracey, featuring five new tracks, is out now.",

Rojava, the Kurdish name for the autonomous region of northern Syria, into which the Turkish army is advancing, is more than a geographic area. It is also an experiment in democracy and equality. It is, in fact, one of <a href=\"https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/against-all-odds-village-republics-take-hold-in-syria-1.152459\" title=\"\">many such experiments </a>that have flourished during the years of the Syrian war, shaped by the work of thinkers such as the late Omar Aziz.

The costs of the Turkish invasion of northern Syria to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d are immense, the latest twist in the seemingly intractable Syrian war. Beyond the immediate human costs, there lies also a deeper loss. Rojava, the Kurdish name for the autonomous region of northern Syria, into which the Turkish army is advancing, is more than a geographic area. It is also an experiment in democracy and equality. It is, in fact, one of many such experiments that have flourished during the years of the Syrian war, shaped by the work of thinkers such as the late Omar Aziz. Most have been crushed either by Bashir al-Assad\u2019s regime or by Islamic State, which once controlled large areas of Syria. Now Rojava, too, is threatened with destruction. It was out of the turmoil of the early years of the Syrian war that Rojava was born. In 2013, the Democratic Union party (PYD), the main political force in the region, established a coalition called the Movement for a Democratic Society (TEV-DEM) and declared autonomy for the region.

They have thumped the Sri Lankans, who actually have an excellent record of winning T20 series in Australia. But often Australian teams of the past have been a bit haphazard, where now the format is being taken a bit more seriously.</p> <p>Finch was destructive early, allowing Warner to ease into his day. Warner then charged on to a fast century, his first in the format and his 39th international century overall, and on his 33rd birthday for the finishing touch. When Finch fell for 64, Glenn Maxwell came in for one of his trademark whirlwinds, 62 from 28 balls at a strike rate of 221.</p> <p>Sri Lanka were never likely to get near 234, but their batting reply was overcooked asparagus. The Australians didn\u2019t have to outbowl them, they really just put the ball there and waited a very short time for mistakes.</p> <p>Spare a thought for Rajitha \u2013 0 for 75 and a second-ball duck. But, terrible games happen in T20s, and good ones might be just around the corner. Sri Lanka will need to get their act together in Melbourne in a couple of days.</p> <p>We\u2019ll see you there. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db53e4a8f0859498cfb3d15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-27T06:53:48.975Z\">6.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>20th over: Sri Lanka 99-9 (Malinga 13, Pradeep 8) </strong>Cummins to finish things off for Australia, one way or another.

Beats the field and goes finer of the sweeper! He\u2019s on 96. Can he get there? Not this ball! He throws his head back in anguish as his next cut shot only gets him a single. Maxwell falls next ball. Ashton Turner comes to the middle, and has no interest but getting a single. Warner carves over cover! Won\u2019t reach the boundary but comes back for two runs. Moves to 99. The field comes in. But he jams away a full ball behind point, belts through for the single, and raises his first T20I century. More runs in this innings than he made in five Ashes Tests, will be the punchline, but with each innings like this he can start to put that horror series behind him.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db525218f0859498cfb3ce9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-27T05:08:10.290Z\">5.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wicket!

He manages to pull things back at the start of this over, bowling not one but two dot balls in a row to Glenn Maxwell, hitting his yorkers. Maxwell finds a single, then Warner carves a boundary to move to 90, and moves past the 89 that he made in his first ever international match, all the way back in 2009 against South Africa at the MCG. Who would have thought that it would stay his highest score in this format for all this time? He\u2019s on for a hundred today. </p> <p>Things don\u2019t end for Rajitha as well as they started this over though. Maxwell wants payback for those dot balls. He takes it <strong>with six runs, </strong>a full toss lifted high over the leg side and into the midwicket crowd. Raises his milestone from just a handful of deliveries. <strong>Then six more!

Gives himself room for the next ball, winds up big, playing that almost helicopter style that he enjoys, whipping through the ball and into a big follow through with the bat over his shoulder. In between those points, he manages to <strong>lace the ball through cover, along the ground, for four!</strong> It\u2019s so well timed that it scorches past the cover fieldsmen, and splits the boundary riders. Gracious. And finally, from his 18th ball, Maxwell faces a dot. He tries the ramp against Malinga and misses the full ball, through to the keeper. Then finds the cover sweeper for a single. But Warner takes up the challenge and drops two runs gently to the leg side, then carves four through cover. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db520ca8f0898437061c5c4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-27T04:47:58.416Z\">4.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>16th over: Australia 185-1 (Warner 80, Maxwell 36) </strong>They can\u2019t find a dot ball to Maxwell, who digs out the yorker again.

But when Maxwell gets the strike back he switches his hands into a reverse ramp shot, over third man for four! That\u2019s extraordinary touch with the upturned face of the bat.

Maxwell is trying that pick-up shot for six off his pads that he favours, spinning his body towards square leg, but he gets an inside edge on the shot and lobs it over the keeper for four instead. That\u2019ll do. Malinga totally loses the next ball, miles down the leg side and it bounces off the pitch. Warner asks why that wasn\u2019t called a no-ball, and the umpire says that the wide call comes before the no-ball call. Malinga zeroes in on the perfect yorker spot next up, and Maxwell can only squeeze it off his toes for one.

      "bodyText": "In lots of T20 games, teams don\u2019t even make a score as big as the margin of Australia\u2019s win today. They have thumped the Sri Lankans, who actually have an excellent record of winning T20 series in Australia. But often Australian teams of the past have been a bit haphazard, where now the format is being taken a bit more seriously. Finch was destructive early, allowing Warner to ease into his day. Warner then charged on to a fast century, his first in the format and his 39th international century overall, and on his 33rd birthday for the finishing touch. When Finch fell for 64, Glenn Maxwell came in for one of his trademark whirlwinds, 62 from 28 balls at a strike rate of 221. Sri Lanka were never likely to get near 234, but their batting reply was overcooked asparagus. The Australians didn\u2019t have to outbowl them, they really just put the ball there and waited a very short time for mistakes. Spare a thought for Rajitha \u2013 0 for 75 and a second-ball duck. But, terrible games happen in T20s, and good ones might be just around the corner. Sri Lanka will need to get their act together in Melbourne in a couple of days. We\u2019ll see you there. 20th over: Sri Lanka 99-9 (Malinga 13, Pradeep 8) Cummins to finish things off for Australia, one way or another. Beats Malinga\u2019s waft on the outside edge. Beats Malinga\u2019s waft on the inside edge, bouncing over the stumps. Yorks Malinga who somehow gets a connecting with a slog after backing away and keeps the ball out. Then Cummins bowls length, and Malinga swats it over wide long-on for four! Cummins isn\u2019t happy. Gives the next short ball a lot more pepper, and a half-ducking Malinga is nowhere near it with his pull shot. But the last ball Cummins misses the yorker, and Malinga can drive it to wide long-on along the ground this time for two. That\u2019s it! 19th over: Sri Lanka 93-9 (Malinga 7, Pradeep 8) Nuwan Pradeep has now outscored six of his teammates, as he carves Richardson over backward point for four, and moves to 7. Nice shot. Then pulls a single. Malinga swings at everything and only connects for a single from the last ball. 18th over: Sri Lanka 87-9 (Malinga 6, Pradeep 3) The one Sri Lankan player who has had a good day is Nuwan Pradeep, who only conceded 28 from his overs. He makes more runs than a few of his teammates in quick time too, backing away from Mitchell Starc to flat-bat over the bowler\u2019s head for a couple. Follows up with a competent squeeze for one against the yorker. Starc just keeps trying to hit that full length. 17th over: Sri Lanka 83-9 (Malinga 5) Two in his final over, and Zampa finishes the day with 3 for 14. You\u2019ll take that. After conceding 75 runs from his four overs, the most expensive bowling spell in this format\u2019s history, Kasun Rajitha is given out for a golden duck. But he gets his first win for the day, challenging the decision and finding that he got a tiny inside edge on his sweep before Zampa pinned him in front. His reprieve lasts one ball, until he heaves at the next ball as well, misses, and drags his back foot out of the crease. Stumped. This is like sitting through a list of terrible speeches at a wedding. Interminable. Zampa turns the ball away a fraction, Sandakan wallops it over cover, but isn\u2019t to the pitch and can\u2019t get enough to clear Agar in the deep. 16th over: Sri Lanka 81-7 (Sandakan 6, Malinga 3) Decent shot from Sandakan as Cummins bowls full, and the Sri Lankan spinner drives him straight down the ground for four. That was quality. Not so effective against the short ball though, swinging and missing plenty. 15th over: Sri Lanka 74-7 (Sandakan 1, Malinga 1) Very much the bowlers at the crease now for Sri Lanka. Zampa 1 for 12 off three. The procession continues, with Shanaka swiping for a big top edge caught at backward point. 14th over: Sri Lanka 71-6 (Shanaka 17) Agar finishes off his spell with a string of dots and singles, then the run-out at the end. Four overs, 1 for 13. Bingo. What an effort from Glenn Maxwell! He\u2019s on the mic to the TV broadcaster having a chat to the commentators as Agar trots in for the last ball of his spell. Hasaranga slaps it over cover towards the rope. It\u2019s Maxwell\u2019s ball. \u201cRun out,\u201d he says on mic as he sprints around the boundary, before he\u2019s reached the ball and before the batsmen have turned for their second run. He\u2019s right, too. Scoops it clean as a whistle, unleashes an 80-metre throw right by the stumps, and Alex Carey has the batsman short by a mile. That. Is. Glorious. 13th over: Sri Lanka 66-5 (Shanaka 15, Hasaranga 2) Shanaka is at least trying to swing. Slices a couple to third man, then takes on a bouncer and clobbers it over midwicket for six! Good shot, waited for the slower ball and timed it. It was a no-ball as well, but Richardson nails his wide yorker to keep the free hit scoreless. A lot of dot balls for Richardson in the over still, despite that big hit. 12th over: Sri Lanka 57-5 (Shanaka 7, Hasaranga 2) Agar, meanwhile, has figures of 1-8 off his three overs. It must be nice to be a spinner in a broken run chase when no one is willing to play a shot at you. 11th over: Sri Lanka 55-5 (Shanaka 6, Hasaranga 1) Shanaka drives a boundary straight, but Starc still finishes his third over with ridiculous figures of 2-14. Another one goes down, as Mitchell Starc comes back into the fray. He hits Shanaka on the helmet second ball of the over, while might well have influenced Perera to hang back to the next ball, after a leg bye. Starc bowls this one to the left-handed Perera from over the wicket, base of leg stump, swinging a bit and evading the defensive grope that Perera is in no position to play. Clunk. 10th over: Sri Lanka 49-4 (Kusal Perera 16, Shanaka 2) Halfway mark. Dasun Shanaka next to the crease, who can hit a long ball but will need to hit about 20 of them. Strange old innings, 13 from 21 when you needed 12 an over from the get-go. And a soft dismissal, as Fernando tries to prod a straight-break off his pads, misses mostly, gets a little inside edge, and plays it off the pad onto his stumps. 9th over: Sri Lanka 45-3 (Kusal Perera 14, Fernando 13) Carey misses a stumping! Down gallops Perera, looking to loft Zampa down the ground, but the top-spinner skips past him with pace. It bounces too much for Carey though, and bounces off his body and away. 8th over: Sri Lanka 40-3 (Kusal Perera 10, Fernando 12) Ashton Agar now, turning the ball the same way as Zampa but via a left-arm orthodox action. Very tidy over, only two runs from it. Sri Lanka adrift. 7th over: Sri Lanka 38-3 (Kusal Perera 9, Fernando 11) Spin time with the field setting relaxed. Adam Zampa the leg-spinner on show. Sri Lanka working some ones and twos, but they need about 16 an over. An appeal as Fernando misses a sweep, but it\u2019s sliding down and he nets three leg byes. 6th over: Sri Lanka 29-3 (Kusal Perera 5, Fernando 10) Cummins drawing more false shots, but Fernando edges one to third man for four, and splices another over cover for two. Perera gets one out of the middle through midwicket to end the over. 5th over: Sri Lanka 17-3 (Kusal Perera 0, Oshada Fernando 3) Kane Richardson bowls another quiet over, just two runs from the bat over cover. There\u2019s a wide also, and Finch probably saves another wide by distracting the umpire with an appeal after Fernando slashes outside off. 4th over: Sri Lanka 14-3 (Kusal Perera 0, Oshada Fernando 1) A fair over for Patrick Cummins, 2-2 at the end of it. Oshada Fernando survives the hat-trick ball but Perera could have been run out at the striker\u2019s end as they took a single from a straight push. Straight through him! The batsmen swapped ends while the previous ball was in the air, so the other incumbent batsman was on strike. Left-hander again. Cummins over the wicket, on leg stump, maybe moved the ball back a bit off the seam and straight through the forward push to hit middle. Clunk. Pretty tame dismissal in the end, again to a cross-bat shot. This time Gunathilaka walks at Cummins and tries to clobber him over the on-side, but miscues it high to mid-off and Warner. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 12-1 (Gunathilaka 11, Rajapaksa 0) A couple of nice shots from Gunathilaka, starting to find his groove as a left-hander against the left-armer. He forces Starc on the up through backward point for four, then gets a straighter ball and glances it fine for four more. If you\u2019re updating your bingo cards, Mark Waugh has just observed that \u201cthey have good wrists, these Sri Lankan players,\u201d then followed up news on that anatomical marvel by reiterating that Isa Guha is \u201cour expert\u201d on pronouncing Sri Lankan names. Yep. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 4-1 (Gunathilaka 1, Rajapaksa 0) The struggles continue for Sri Lanka. Kane Richardson bowling, a decent line and length, but the batsmen are caught between wanting to go after him and not wanting to start a collapse. They take only a couple of singles, then the left-handed Gunathilaka tries to flay the last ball over point and should be caught by Agar on the rope, but the low catch is put down. 1st over: Sri Lanka 1-1 (Gunathilaka 1, Rajapaksa 0) The perfect start for Australia: wickets, barely a run, and the required rate shoots up. Starc to start off, Maxwell at backward point into the game immediately as Starc\u2019s pace and fuller length jumps at the bat and can only be skewed away on the bounce. Both batsmen just trying to defend Starc\u2019s early deliveries, with only a single from the first four balls. The fifth, Kusal Mendis tries to hook the short ball, he\u2019s late on it, and it bobbles up to square leg for a catch. There have only been two higher run chases to win in international cricket. Australia have Cummins and Starc to rough them up. It will take something extraordinary. It\u2019s been a fun day for Australia so far. Finch shook off his concerns from last season. Warner will have quietened a few doubts. Maxwell provided the pyrotechnics. The only downside was that Steve Smith didn\u2019t get a chance to show his stuff, but there are five more matches in this quick run before the Tests begin. 20th over: Australia 233-2 (Warner 92, Maxwell 62) Dasun Shanaka, the all-rounder, has to bowl the last over with Malinga bowled out early. He starts very wide of off stump, and Warner goes after it but is nowhere near it. It\u2019s called a wide though, and Warner carves the re-bowl through backward point for four! Beats the field and goes finer of the sweeper! He\u2019s on 96. Can he get there? Not this ball! He throws his head back in anguish as his next cut shot only gets him a single. Maxwell falls next ball. Ashton Turner comes to the middle, and has no interest but getting a single. Warner carves over cover! Won\u2019t reach the boundary but comes back for two runs. Moves to 99. The field comes in. But he jams away a full ball behind point, belts through for the single, and raises his first T20I century. More runs in this innings than he made in five Ashes Tests, will be the punchline, but with each innings like this he can start to put that horror series behind him. He\u2019s caught behind, between his legs, trying to squeeze the ball behind square. But was that out. The ball went past Maxwell\u2019s inside edge as he had his legs apart, perhaps trying to play the ball between his legs. Yet somehow after (presumably) taking a nick, the ball carried through to the keeper. Given out after a long period of consideration by the umpire. Maxwell reviewed, and for a long time it looks lie the third umpire thinks he\u2019s not out. \u201cNothing evident there,\u201d he keeps saying while looking at the replays. But right at the end he decides that the bundle of noise on the Snickometer means there was a nick. Unorthodox player, unorthodox dismissal. That was fun. 19th over: Australia 223-1 (Warner 92, Maxwell 62) Can Warner get a hundred? Only a single from this over for him, with another dot against Pradeep to start. Maxwell plays another outrageous shot, a reverse scoop again, but this time reaching for the ball well outside off stump rather than playing it off the line of his body. There\u2019s actually a slip in place, or a short third man almost, but Maxwell plays it anyway. And goes over and fine of that man for four! Then Maxwell slices two from the last ball, thanks to an overthrow that gives Warner strike for the last over. 18th over: Australia 216-1 (Warner 91, Maxwell 56) To this point, Rajitha had bowled the most expensive three-over spell in T20 Internationals. He manages to pull things back at the start of this over, bowling not one but two dot balls in a row to Glenn Maxwell, hitting his yorkers. Maxwell finds a single, then Warner carves a boundary to move to 90, and moves past the 89 that he made in his first ever international match, all the way back in 2009 against South Africa at the MCG. Who would have thought that it would stay his highest score in this format for all this time? He\u2019s on for a hundred today. Things don\u2019t end for Rajitha as well as they started this over though. Maxwell wants payback for those dot balls. He takes it with six runs, a full toss lifted high over the leg side and into the midwicket crowd. Raises his milestone from just a handful of deliveries. Then six more! Again that helicopter whip of the bat, this time to leg! And another shot into the crowd! 17th over: Australia 198-1 (Warner 86, Maxwell 43) Malinga nails the yorker again, but Maxwell manages to play it straight this time, meaning he can come back for two. Gives himself room for the next ball, winds up big, playing that almost helicopter style that he enjoys, whipping through the ball and into a big follow through with the bat over his shoulder. In between those points, he manages to lace the ball through cover, along the ground, for four! It\u2019s so well timed that it scorches past the cover fieldsmen, and splits the boundary riders. Gracious. And finally, from his 18th ball, Maxwell faces a dot. He tries the ramp against Malinga and misses the full ball, through to the keeper. Then finds the cover sweeper for a single. But Warner takes up the challenge and drops two runs gently to the leg side, then carves four through cover. 16th over: Australia 185-1 (Warner 80, Maxwell 36) They can\u2019t find a dot ball to Maxwell, who digs out the yorker again. A couple of dot balls to Warner, as Pradeep continues his good work for the day, the only bowler not to be collared. But when Maxwell gets the strike back he switches his hands into a reverse ramp shot, over third man for four! That\u2019s extraordinary touch with the upturned face of the bat. Then keeps strike with a single through cover. He\u2019s 36 from 15. 15th over: Australia 178-1 (Warner 79, Maxwell 30) Malinga comes on, desperate for control and a wicket. Not from Maxwell though, who finds another boundary. Maxwell is trying that pick-up shot for six off his pads that he favours, spinning his body towards square leg, but he gets an inside edge on the shot and lobs it over the keeper for four instead. That\u2019ll do. Malinga totally loses the next ball, miles down the leg side and it bounces off the pitch. Warner asks why that wasn\u2019t called a no-ball, and the umpire says that the wide call comes before the no-ball call. Malinga zeroes in on the perfect yorker spot next up, and Maxwell can only squeeze it off his toes for one. Width to Warner, who carves another boundary through backward point, then two more cut off the toe of the bat. Maxwell 30 off 12. 14th over: Australia 165-1 (Warner 72, Maxwell 25) Maxwell, flying already, down on one knee and sweeps, hard and flat, out through square leg for four! Gunathilake dives but is touching the rope as he saves. Hasaranga the leggie is bowling, and next ball Maxwell leans back and heaves over midwicket for six! It went high and long, dropping into the crowd where it\u2019s caught and given out by the gentleman in the seats. Carves through point but can\u2019t beat the field this time. Warner can though, by getting a fat full toss, served up on a dish with gravy around it, waist high, and he pulls it over square leg for six! Then lofts down the ground for four! Ouch, Sri Lanka. Maxwell 25 from 10, strike rate of 250 now. Hasn\u2019t faced a dot ball. 13th over: Australia 143-1 (Warner 61, Maxwell 14) Warner off strike taking an extra run after the keeper fumbles a wide. Maxwell facing Sandakan is taking guard well outside leg stump, wanting to give himself lots of room to move. And move he does, switching to a left-handed stance and sweeping over backward point for four! He had a space on the off side and found a way to use it. Next ball, Maxwell holds his original pose and goes over cover for four more! Lofted, classy shot finding the gap. He tries the reverse again to follow, but can only get a single to short third. Warner gives him back the strike, but Maxwell\u2019s sweep only takes a top edge for a couple of runs over fine leg, then keeps the strike with a single to cover. Maxwell going at a lazy strike rate of 200 so far. 12th over: Australia 128-1 (Warner 60, Maxwell 2) A consolidation over, and Sri Lanka will be happy with that, just slowing the charge for six balls. Only five singles from it, with Maxwell taking two from his two balls faced. Setting himself, but Warner taking a breather as well from Hasaranga. 11th over: Australia 123-1 (Warner 57, Maxwell 0) Warner gets a run from the final ball of the over, and away they\u2019ll go with a new partnership. Finch goes! Sweeps Sandakan twice for four along the ground, but tries to go aerial from the fifth ball of the over and it comes down shy of the rope, where Mendis takes a good catch diving forward. Finally the breakthrough, and Glenn Maxwell next in. 10th over: Australia 112-0 (Finch 55, Warner 55) Australian batsmen love facing the white Kookaburra ball in home conditions where there\u2019s no lateral movement. It was harder to tee off in England during the World Cup back in June and July with the ball often seaming or swinging, but here you can just go through the line. Finch does, high and long over backward square off his legs, dropping it for six. Takes a single. Warner follows up with six of his own, over cover to just clear the rope! And again, off his legs this time over midwicket, six more! That\u2019s Warner\u2019s fifty as well as Finch\u2019s in the over, and Warner follows up by lacing Rajitha through cover for four. Poor old Rajitha has gone for 57 from 18 balls. Will he get another over? 9th over: Australia 87-0 (Finch 46, Warner 39) Welcome Australia\u2019s new right-hander! David Warner plays a full switch-hit sweep to Sandakan for four! Great contact, out through backward square leg. Warner was batting right-handed and left-handed in the nets before this match, alternating with each delivery, so he\u2019s in touch with either hand apparently. 8th over: Australia 80-0 (Finch 44, Warner 34) Wrist-spin that goes the other way from the other end, with Wanindu Hasaranga. He\u2019s a fast leg-spinner in the modern style, putting some serious work on the ball but getting it to skip through. A couple of singles from his first three balls, but then Finch decides he\u2019s got to go. Fakes a step-away, then just shuffles back to make a bit of room, and takes a decent ball from just outside off stump over extra cover for six! Big strike! Then gets a similar ball next up and goes the other way for six, over midwicket! Steps back, has just enough length to get under the ball, and heaves it away. Then tries to take a crazy single to the on-side, Hasarange runs and slides and fields, and while he has all the time in the world, he has a wild throw at the stumps while still lying on the ground. Misses, and would have run him out easily. 7th over: Australia 65-0 (Finch 30, Warner 33) As soon as the fielding restrictions end, on comes Lakshan Sandakan. A left-arm wrist spinner, he helped roll Australia over in the Kandy Test match of 2016 on debut. He\u2019s had a haircut since then, reduced the floppy curls. Doesn\u2019t start his first over well though: a drag-down that Warner pulls for two, then floating down leg and swept for two. Produces three dot balls by bowling tighter on the stumps, but slips leg side to close out the over, and Warner plays a double-hit sweep that hits the face of the bat once near the splice, then again out of the middle as the shot catches up with the ball, Warner laughingly relating this to Finch as they set off for a run. But the ball runs for four. 6th over: Australia 57-0 (Finch 30, Warner 25) The Sri Lankans need control to close out the Powerplay, and Nuwan Pradeep provides it. A series of slower balls, changing the pace regularly and not giving width, and the Australians can only take five singles. Still, they\u2019ve ended the fielding restrictions period going at 9.5 runs per over. 5th over: Australia 52-0 (Finch 28, Warner 22) Rajitha back at Malinga\u2019s end, and Warner is getting frustrated with 7 from 8 deliveries. So he dips his knees a bit, takes a swing across the line at a fuller ball, and smears it over midwicket for four. One bounce not far from the rope. That forces Rajitha to err twice with the next ball, striving for pace: he pushes it wide, and he oversteps. Warner slices the wide ball to the third man fence for four! And has a free hit to follow, which he pulls for six into the Chappell stand! Fair hit that, just picked it up from a medium length and sent it soaring. He\u2019s stopped from taking a second run after carving into the carvers, and then Finch gets in on the act with a lofted drive over cover for four. That\u2019s 21 from the over. 4th over: Australia 31-0 (Finch 23, Warner 7) Nuwan Pradeep replacing Rajitha after one over, and immediately he\u2019s through Finch, striking the pad and appealing loudly. Was that going down the leg side? Not out, says the umpire. Finch decides to heave away, twice connecting with about half of a fuller ball and dragging it away through the leg side, hitting gaps in the field for four. 3rd over: Australia 20-0 (Finch 13, Warner 6) A brilliant controlling over from Malinga, pitching up but giving no width to play it, cramping each of the batsmen and limiting them to a couple of singles. Now Mark Waugh is making jokes about Isa Guha\u2019s bowling being so slow it\u2019s measured in negative kilometres an hour. Wow, the LOLs. 2nd over: Australia 20-0 (Finch 13, Warner 6) A decent battle there. Rajitha gets some seam movement and beats Finch twice, but in between times Finch clobbers a couple through the off side for four. 1st over: Australia 9-0 (Finch 5, Warner 3) First ball of the over, four. Finch struggled hard in the last home summer in all formats, after a promotion to the Test team destabilised his one-day batting. But he gets a good chance to get going with his first ball of this season, short and wide and sitting up to be cracked through cover point for four. Malinga comes back with a smart delivery, rolling the seam and getting it to cut away from the edge. Finch goes hard at the next and gets a thick edge for a single to third man. Now it\u2019s Warner on strike for his first ball... and he gets a misfield at backward point! Through for a couple of runs. Then a single punched down the ground. For those playing at home, it has taken Mark Waugh four deliveries of the international season to make a long and laboured \u201cgee these Sri Lankan names are hard to pronounce\u201d gag. He says Isa Guha can do them all. Do you get it? She must know how because she\u2019s Asian. (Not because she actually bothers to do preparation for her job.) File that under vintage Australian comedy gold, shall we? Lasith Malinga, the fast bowler, will captain Sri Lanka today on his return to the side. The keeper Kusal Perera and batsman Kusal Mendis are the other two who sat out the tour of Pakistan who are playing today. Malinga has the new ball. There will be a lot of firsts for Steve Smith and David Warner this summer, but this one is simple enough: their first game for Australia at home in any format since their year-long bans after Cape Town 2018. They\u2019re both back in the side. Warner has had a lot of low scores across all formats lately, and needs some confidence, while Smith needs to show that he\u2019s actually in Australia\u2019s best T20 side versus some more powerful strikers. He\u2019s highly versatile, but Test cricket is his fort\u00e9. Australia Aaron Finch * David Warner Steve Smith Glenn Maxwell Ashton Turner Alex Carey + Ashton Agar Pat Cummins Mitchell Starc Kane Richardson Adam Zampa Sri Lanka Kusal Mendis Danushka Gunathilaka Bhanuka Rajapaksa Kusal Perera + Oshada Fernando Dasun Shanaka Wanindu Hasaranga Lakshan Sandakan Nuwan Pradeep Kasun Rajitha Lasith Malinga * The visiting team prefer to chase, as so many do in T20s. That will give us a look at the Australian batting first-up. Sri Lanka have plenty to feel confident about, after touring Pakistan against the No1 T20 side in the world and winning 3-0. There will be some personnel changes though, after a lot of Sri Lankan players chose not to tour Pakistan. Well, the Australian cricket season this year began before the English one had ended, with the men and women\u2019s versions of the 50-over domestic competition getting underway in September. The women\u2019s international players started their season not long after, and now a month later the men\u2019s internationals get underway with half a dozen T20 games, three against Sri Lanka and then three against Pakistan. Not that you\u2019d know it if you don\u2019t have cable TV, because all of these games will only be broadcast visually in Murdoch land. Luckily the OBO is here, and ABC radio, to help those follow these games who should wish to.",

      "body": "<p>The first picture in the <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/lucian-freud-self-portraits\" title=\"\">Royal Academy\u2019s exhibition of self-portraits by <strong>Lucian Freud</strong></a> dates from 1948 and is titled <em>Startled Man</em>. It is a pencil drawing, but you would no more refer to it as a sketch than you would refer to a three-course dinner as a snack. Freud would have been 25 when he made it and, if not already married (to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/11/hallucinogenic-lucian-freud-drawing-on-sale-after-being-off-radar-since-1948\" title=\"\">Kitty Garman</a>, one of Jacob Epstein\u2019s daughters), then soon to be so \u2013 and in some ways, its immaculacy seems to speak to that moment. The artist\u2019s depiction of his youthful self is boyishly sensual: his lips like pillows, his skin as smooth as a sheet stretched over a mattress. Freud\u2019s new status must, at the time, have seemed surprising, not to say alarming, and here he bottles that incredulity for posterity. You can almost hear the sharp intake of breath.</p> <p>But look more closely, and something else emerges. Freud\u2019s head is tipped back, as if there were invisible hands at his throat, or someone yanking his hair from behind. This creeping violence sets the tone for much of what follows. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/21/lucian-freud-died-aged-88\" title=\"\">Freud\u2019s self-portraits</a> (there are 56 here, some of them rarely seen in public) are all sorts of things: tender, witty, experimental and \u2013 yes, that dread word \u2013 visceral. To walk around this show is to be powerfully aware both of his intense single-mindedness \u2013 the sheer quality of his concentration \u2013 and of his abiding fascination with the idea of the shifting, slippery self; the experience is a little like being watched. But if some red thread does link them, it is surely this inescapable menace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f1cdcc6c2ba1e4fdf8b51c5b283c1276e530ba1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f1cdcc6c2ba1e4fdf8b51c5b283c1276e530ba1/0_0_4819_7554/638.jpg\" alt=\"Startled Man: Self Portrait, 1948 by Lucian Freud.\" width=\"638\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Startled Man: Self Portrait, 1948 by Lucian Freud.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 The Lucian Freud Archive / Bridgeman Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The curators, Jasper Sharp of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, and the artist David Dawson, Freud\u2019s longtime studio assistant, suggest that his self-portraits have an elusive quality, one that brings to mind a game of hide and seek. I know what they mean \u2013 in <em>Untitled (Self-Portrait)</em>, 1978, it is as if Freud is being swallowed by fog, like some Victorian spectre \u2013 but it\u2019s also the case that I\u2019ve seldom felt the presence of an artist in a gallery so strongly as here. Even when he\u2019s barely in the picture \u2013 just a pair of feet in the corner (<em>Naked Portrait With Reflection</em>, 1980), or a shadow falling across an unmade bed (<a href=\"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/lucian-freud/flora-with-blue-toe-nails-2001.jpg\" title=\"\"><em>Flora With Blue Toenails</em></a>, 2000-01) \u2013 his presence is palpable, a pulse throbbing in your ear.</p> <p>In <em>Man With a Feather </em><em>(Self-Portrait</em>), 1943, Freud paints himself in a dark jacket and a narrow tie: gangsterish accoutrements that are at stark odds both with his blank, rather innocent face and the feather that he holds in his hand. In <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/width-340/public/images/lucian%20freud%20hotel%20bedroom.jpg\" title=\"\"><em>Hotel Bedroom</em>, 1954</a> (the last painting he ever did sitting down), he looms over his second wife, Caroline Blackwood, like a cliff. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/sep/04/the-top-10-self-portraits-in-art-lucian-freud-sherman-rembrandt\" title=\"\"><em>Reflection With Two Children</em> <em>(Self-Portrait)</em>, 1965</a>, his daughter and son <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/22/lucian-freud-painter-interview\" title=\"\">Rose and Ali Boyt</a> are tiny in one corner, while he gazes into the mirror he placed on the floor for the purposes of painting the picture, huge and God-like.</p> <p>Though Freud insisted that his work was \u201cpurely autobiographical\u201d, he wasn\u2019t keen on the idea of narrative; his fixation was with boiling people down to their essence. But this painting tells its own story. Here is a battle (for time, for space, or perhaps even for primacy) in which he appears as the victor. Finally, there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jan/19/lucian-freud-fight-portrait-sale\" title=\"\"><em>Self-Portrait With a Black Eye</em>, 1978</a>, made after an altercation with a taxi driver, in which the physical result of violence is the source of both pride and irresistible curiosity (another kind of man, and even of artist, would have been resting with a steak on his face, not standing in front of his easel).</p> <p>This is a magnificent and utterly absorbing exhibition: stopped clocks, and all that. Like a diver, you go down and down, only to emerge with a slight sense of the bends: outside, the world is not, after all, controlled by the deity that is Freud.

      "bodyText": "The first picture in the Royal Academy\u2019s exhibition of self-portraits by Lucian Freud dates from 1948 and is titled Startled Man. It is a pencil drawing, but you would no more refer to it as a sketch than you would refer to a three-course dinner as a snack. Freud would have been 25 when he made it and, if not already married (to Kitty Garman, one of Jacob Epstein\u2019s daughters), then soon to be so \u2013 and in some ways, its immaculacy seems to speak to that moment. The artist\u2019s depiction of his youthful self is boyishly sensual: his lips like pillows, his skin as smooth as a sheet stretched over a mattress. Freud\u2019s new status must, at the time, have seemed surprising, not to say alarming, and here he bottles that incredulity for posterity. You can almost hear the sharp intake of breath. But look more closely, and something else emerges. Freud\u2019s head is tipped back, as if there were invisible hands at his throat, or someone yanking his hair from behind. This creeping violence sets the tone for much of what follows. Freud\u2019s self-portraits (there are 56 here, some of them rarely seen in public) are all sorts of things: tender, witty, experimental and \u2013 yes, that dread word \u2013 visceral. To walk around this show is to be powerfully aware both of his intense single-mindedness \u2013 the sheer quality of his concentration \u2013 and of his abiding fascination with the idea of the shifting, slippery self; the experience is a little like being watched. But if some red thread does link them, it is surely this inescapable menace. The curators, Jasper Sharp of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, and the artist David Dawson, Freud\u2019s longtime studio assistant, suggest that his self-portraits have an elusive quality, one that brings to mind a game of hide and seek. I know what they mean \u2013 in Untitled (Self-Portrait), 1978, it is as if Freud is being swallowed by fog, like some Victorian spectre \u2013 but it\u2019s also the case that I\u2019ve seldom felt the presence of an artist in a gallery so strongly as here. Even when he\u2019s barely in the picture \u2013 just a pair of feet in the corner (Naked Portrait With Reflection, 1980), or a shadow falling across an unmade bed (Flora With Blue Toenails, 2000-01) \u2013 his presence is palpable, a pulse throbbing in your ear. In Man With a Feather (Self-Portrait), 1943, Freud paints himself in a dark jacket and a narrow tie: gangsterish accoutrements that are at stark odds both with his blank, rather innocent face and the feather that he holds in his hand. In Hotel Bedroom, 1954 (the last painting he ever did sitting down), he looms over his second wife, Caroline Blackwood, like a cliff. In Reflection With Two Children (Self-Portrait), 1965, his daughter and son Rose and Ali Boyt are tiny in one corner, while he gazes into the mirror he placed on the floor for the purposes of painting the picture, huge and God-like. Though Freud insisted that his work was \u201cpurely autobiographical\u201d, he wasn\u2019t keen on the idea of narrative; his fixation was with boiling people down to their essence. But this painting tells its own story. Here is a battle (for time, for space, or perhaps even for primacy) in which he appears as the victor. Finally, there is Self-Portrait With a Black Eye, 1978, made after an altercation with a taxi driver, in which the physical result of violence is the source of both pride and irresistible curiosity (another kind of man, and even of artist, would have been resting with a steak on his face, not standing in front of his easel). This is a magnificent and utterly absorbing exhibition: stopped clocks, and all that. Like a diver, you go down and down, only to emerge with a slight sense of the bends: outside, the world is not, after all, controlled by the deity that is Freud. It covers a life, and because of this it presents the remarkable scope of the artist\u2019s talents, from the enamelled exquisiteness of the early work to the impasto of the late; from the smaller canvases he favoured at the start of his career to the outsize ones he made towards the end. Thanks to this, too, it\u2019s moving in a very human way. Here, paint represents years: the thicker it grows, the greater the intimations of mortality. Somewhere towards the end, he makes Painter Working, Reflection, 1993, a self-portrait that is seemingly without vanity \u2013 the slippers the nude Freud wears in it have a singular pathos \u2013 but that also, by sheer dint of its size, demands that you pay attention to the ruined realms of its subject\u2019s body. It is marvellous and noble and strange, and you feel better for having gawped at it: ready, as it were, for the long fight ahead. Gauguin Portraits at the National Gallery is a blockbuster show.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m sitting atop a red granite boulder with Rovin, my guide. Below us is a billowing green expanse of jungle broken only by the sinuous line of a river and a low range of hills, one of which we are seated on. There is no sign of humanity: no smoke pillars, no clearings, no masts or buildings, not even a jet trail across the sky. Instead, there\u2019s a formation of six red-and-green macaws, cackling as they go, and in the nearby fig tree the flitterings of tiny, jewel-like birds in splendid emerald and sapphire livery.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"70e524228413b7caae9d51562a2f3d1989d21076\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70e524228413b7caae9d51562a2f3d1989d21076/0_0_1102_763/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guyana map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThis area,\u201d says Rovin, pointing ahead at a vast jungle contained in a natural bowl several miles across, \u201cis unexplored.

On one side was the sobering amount of carbon dioxide produced by the return long-haul flight and three short internal flights \u2013 about 2.8 tonnes according to <a href=\"https://www.myclimate.org/\" title=\"\">myclimate.org</a> (see Carbon Calculation below). On the other hand \u2013 with a very large question mark next to it \u2013 were the potential advantages to communities visited in one of the least explored parts of South America, a country that saw fewer than 300,000 travellers last year.</p> \n<p>I had thought this would be a difficult equation to balance. With the planet in the grip of a climate crisis, can there be any justification for such a journey?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1f9a80c27bb3f4bf847549b7c645bc8d55411688\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f9a80c27bb3f4bf847549b7c645bc8d55411688/0_262_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rovin (rear right) scanning for wildlife at sunset.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rovin (rear, right) scanning for wildlife at sunset.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Rovin starts doing the maths for me. \u201cWe have about 350 square kilometres of jungle and have applied to take over another 350 of what is now state land. We get about 200 visitors a year and we want 400, no more. We don\u2019t want to be rich, but we want to keep our forest. We do need money for medicines, education and supplies.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/19/guardian-climate-pledge-2019-air-travel-advice\">Guardian climate pledge 2019: 'With air travel, it's best to take a flexitarian approach'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Take away the tourists and the need for an income would soon drive these communities into the arms of loggers, ranchers, goldminers and oilmen.</p> \n<p>Rovin is head wildlife guide at <a href=\"https://www.rewaecolodge.com/\" title=\"\">Rewa Ecolodge</a>, run by members of the Makushi tribe, one of nine Amerindian groups in Guyana.

The vast interior is largely rainforest where tiny communities are often connected only by river. Such is the high rainfall, the mouth of the Essequibo, the country\u2019s largest river, is as wide as the Channel at Dover.</p> \n<p>After admiring the view, and birds, Rovin and I head down the narrow, rocky trail.

The Guyanese jungle bristles and prickles around us: I notice tiny movements in the leaf litter and see ticks scuttling towards my boots, drawn by body heat. Later I remove one from my stomach. Look up and each tree is festooned with ferns, creepers and orchids. Glance down inside a fern and there, in the captured rainwater, swim tadpoles and frogs alongside all the insect larvae and eggs. No wonder this place gobbles up CO2.

At first I think it must be a jaguar in the water, such is the power and agility, but it\u2019s a giant <a href=\"https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/facts-about-giant-otters/\" title=\"\">river otter</a>, almost two metres long.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we opened the lodge in 2005,\u201d Rovin says, \u201cwe stopped the hunters coming in. Now we see more and more of everything: otters, macaws, jaguars.\u201d There have been other benefits: men working on Brazilian ranches and in Guyanese gold mines have come home. The community is happier and healthier, generally pleased with what had been a difficult decision.</p> \n<p>The Guyanese jungles are part of the Guiana Shield, a vast region of north-east South America, a biodiversity hotspot that is separate from the Amazon and contains more than 1,000 bird species and 269 known amphibians (more are constantly being found). Compare that with around 700 birds and 85 amphibians in all of Europe, which is almost four times larger. Many of these Guiana Shield species are endemic. A few days earlier I\u2019d trekked through jungle near Kaieteur Falls (the biggest single-drop falls in the world) to see the spectacular <a href=\"https://neotropical.birds.cornell.edu/Species-Account/nb/species/gcoroc1/overview\" title=\"\">Guianan cock-of-the-rock</a>, a bird more orange than Donald Trump yet tweeting with more wisdom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"96c62c2d89ac7b20816e511d4258f62b81a7bf65\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96c62c2d89ac7b20816e511d4258f62b81a7bf65/0_244_3659_2195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red and Green macaws flying over Rewa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red-and-green macaws flying over Rewa.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Back on the river, we take a side channel then transfer to a nearby oxbow lake and a paddled boat. The sun is dropping low over the trees as Rovin gives a deep belly growl that immediately gets a vigorous response with wild splashing noises from the reedbeds. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.crocodilesoftheworld.co.uk/animals/black-caiman/\" title=\"\">Black caimans</a>,\u201d he grins, then points one out. Next to it, something huge rolls and I glimpse a long, scaly back. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/arapaima/\" title=\"\">Arapaima</a>,\u201d Rovin whispers, the largest scaled freshwater fish, reaching up to three metres in length.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m sitting atop a red granite boulder with Rovin, my guide. Below us is a billowing green expanse of jungle broken only by the sinuous line of a river and a low range of hills, one of which we are seated on. There is no sign of humanity: no smoke pillars, no clearings, no masts or buildings, not even a jet trail across the sky. Instead, there\u2019s a formation of six red-and-green macaws, cackling as they go, and in the nearby fig tree the flitterings of tiny, jewel-like birds in splendid emerald and sapphire livery. \u201cThis area,\u201d says Rovin, pointing ahead at a vast jungle contained in a natural bowl several miles across, \u201cis unexplored. It belongs to our community, but no one has been there.\u201d He pauses while a pair of black lizards skitter past. \u201cWe\u2019ve had oil companies, loggers and gold miners come here, but we\u2019ve said no to all of them.\u201d When I first considered visiting central Guyana, I found myself doing a cost-benefit analysis. On one side was the sobering amount of carbon dioxide produced by the return long-haul flight and three short internal flights \u2013 about 2.8 tonnes according to myclimate.org (see Carbon Calculation below). On the other hand \u2013 with a very large question mark next to it \u2013 were the potential advantages to communities visited in one of the least explored parts of South America, a country that saw fewer than 300,000 travellers last year. I had thought this would be a difficult equation to balance. With the planet in the grip of a climate crisis, can there be any justification for such a journey? Rovin starts doing the maths for me. \u201cWe have about 350 square kilometres of jungle and have applied to take over another 350 of what is now state land. We get about 200 visitors a year and we want 400, no more. We don\u2019t want to be rich, but we want to keep our forest. We do need money for medicines, education and supplies.\u201d Take away the tourists and the need for an income would soon drive these communities into the arms of loggers, ranchers, goldminers and oilmen. Rovin is head wildlife guide at Rewa Ecolodge, run by members of the Makushi tribe, one of nine Amerindian groups in Guyana. The country is about the size of Great Britain but with only a tiny fraction of the population; some 780,000 people, most living on the coast. The vast interior is largely rainforest where tiny communities are often connected only by river. Such is the high rainfall, the mouth of the Essequibo, the country\u2019s largest river, is as wide as the Channel at Dover. After admiring the view, and birds, Rovin and I head down the narrow, rocky trail. At one point I stop in disbelief: some idiot has dropped a large triangle of iridescent blue plastic. I despair of humans. The first piece of litter in days. I bend down. It is a morpho butterfly. \u201cYou know what,\u201d I say to Rovin, \u201cyour jungle is full of treasures that are better than gold or oil.\u201d He grins and points out a green-tailed jacamar, a bee-eater-like bird, perched in a confusing dapple of leaf and shade. The Guyanese jungle bristles and prickles around us: I notice tiny movements in the leaf litter and see ticks scuttling towards my boots, drawn by body heat. Later I remove one from my stomach. Look up and each tree is festooned with ferns, creepers and orchids. Glance down inside a fern and there, in the captured rainwater, swim tadpoles and frogs alongside all the insect larvae and eggs. No wonder this place gobbles up CO2. Calculations by an international team including Professor Oliver Phillips of Leeds University put the figure at around 200 tonnes per sq km per year (see rainfor.org). Rovin brings me to the riverbank, where we board his motorised canoe. I tell him about solar-powered outboards. He had not heard of them. Stop the calculation! What if a tourist brings a useful idea? How does that fit into any equation? And don\u2019t imagine the lodge would not take up new ideas: it\u2019s already ditched diesel generators and gone entirely solar. We move out into the river and spot something swimming. At first I think it must be a jaguar in the water, such is the power and agility, but it\u2019s a giant river otter, almost two metres long. \u201cWhen we opened the lodge in 2005,\u201d Rovin says, \u201cwe stopped the hunters coming in. Now we see more and more of everything: otters, macaws, jaguars.\u201d There have been other benefits: men working on Brazilian ranches and in Guyanese gold mines have come home. The community is happier and healthier, generally pleased with what had been a difficult decision. The Guyanese jungles are part of the Guiana Shield, a vast region of north-east South America, a biodiversity hotspot that is separate from the Amazon and contains more than 1,000 bird species and 269 known amphibians (more are constantly being found). Compare that with around 700 birds and 85 amphibians in all of Europe, which is almost four times larger. Many of these Guiana Shield species are endemic. A few days earlier I\u2019d trekked through jungle near Kaieteur Falls (the biggest single-drop falls in the world) to see the spectacular Guianan cock-of-the-rock, a bird more orange than Donald Trump yet tweeting with more wisdom. Back on the river, we take a side channel then transfer to a nearby oxbow lake and a paddled boat. The sun is dropping low over the trees as Rovin gives a deep belly growl that immediately gets a vigorous response with wild splashing noises from the reedbeds. \u201cBlack caimans,\u201d he grins, then points one out. Next to it, something huge rolls and I glimpse a long, scaly back. \u201cArapaima,\u201d Rovin whispers, the largest scaled freshwater fish, reaching up to three metres in length. Rovin is part of a team from Rewa community lodge who have pioneered the art of catch-and-release for these giants. In 2015 it resulted in a world record specimen of 189kg. Another arapaima rolls and an osprey flies over. There are harpy eagles here too, but we are not destined to be lucky in that department. After returning to the clean and simple riverside lodge, we eat chicken and plantains for dinner. A pink-toe tarantula is removed from one cabin. That night I lift the lid on the outside toilet and a frog bounces up, hitting me in the chest. A rustle in the trees above alerts me to a kinkajou, something like a raccoon, but in a genus of its own. Dawn brings a symphony of birdsong: the liquid warblings of oropendolas underscored by the percussive rap of red-naped woodpecker and tuneless toucan screeches. A red-rumped agouti, looking like a guinea pig on steroids, scuttles away from the huts pursued by a crested caracara, a type of forest falcon with a Peaky Blinders haircut. In the boat once again we move upstream, then walk into a forest of giant mora trees, a favourite hardwood for loggers who, no doubt, would love to get their hands on them. As we walk, my mind drifts back to my carbon calculations.

A specially created force charged with protecting protesters stood by, its unarmed soldiers toting Iraqi flags and white plastic flowers. \u201cWe are tired! We are dying! Why are they shooting at us? They are worse than Saddam!\u201d, shouted one young woman with an Iraqi flag draped around her face who wanted to remain anonymous. In another sign of growing nationalist sentiments, many protesters called for an end to Iran\u2019s growing influence in Iraq. \u201cOut, out Iran, Baghdad remains free!\u201d, protesters chanted. Parties with close ties to Iran control one of the largest factions in parliament, while their armed wings have been formally integrated into Iraq\u2019s security apparatus. Some of these groups stand accused of setting up an autonomous crisis cell to crush the first wave of protests in early October, deploying snipers to target demonstrators and attacking media outlets who covered the unrest. Yet the use of force appears to do little to curb spirits. \u201cWe weren\u2019t scared of Isis, so why should we be scared of those thieves?\u201d said Kadhum, a former soldier who lost a leg in the war against Islamic State. \u201cThey think when they hit us that they\u2019re scaring us, but no: they are actually increasing our determination.\u201d",

No, it\u2019s not a pottery-related pastime. Clay-based cleansers are highly moisturising, kind-to-scalp shampoo alternatives. Washing hair in this way has long been a thing within the natural/curly hair community. While everyone raves about how great it is for textured hair types like mine, I initially shied away from the process. My reticence was down to the fact that most clay-based products I had come across were in pots and masks. For me, these had \u2018messy\u2019 and \u2018high maintenance\u2019 written all over them. Now, however, I am sold. This particular offering, a French pink clay formulation, is wonderful. I immediately fell for the texture and the colour. It feels like a heavy but not stiff conditioner and looks like a strawberry-flavoured Angel Delight. You simply apply it to your hair and your scalp as you would your normal shampoo, and massage it in. It does not foam at all. For anyone who has been indoctrinated to love suds as much as I do, this was slightly disconcerting. So I was sceptical as to whether it would clean my hair. Thankfully it did that and so much more. My curls were detangled, super soft, incredibly defined and stayed that way all week. For those results, I am more than happy to go sud free.</p> <h2>On my radar: full lip service, a drop of dew, stylish scents</h2> <p><strong>Gold standard </strong>I normally turn my nose up at \u2018wearable\u2019 fragrance products, but I love this.

Focus on the dark eyes, nude lip combo \u2013 it is one of the easiest ways to channel modernity without looking try-hard. Start with a skin finish foundation, but don\u2019t go overboard otherwise you\u2019ll look ancient. Minimalists can swap shadow for liner. To get the most authentic nude, use a shade that matches your natural lip colour, adding a lighter hue in the middle. And don\u2019t forget to put on your brows. Essentials 1.

Huda Beauty Life Liner \u00a322, hudabeauty.com I can\u2019t do without: a clay-based shampoo that\u2019s a cut above Trepadora Hibiscus Pink Cleansing Clay-Wash, \u00a319, trepadora.com I\u2019ve been co-washing (a conditioner shampoo hybrid that is gentler and less stripping) for a while now, but recently began Clay Washing. No, it\u2019s not a pottery-related pastime. Clay-based cleansers are highly moisturising, kind-to-scalp shampoo alternatives. Washing hair in this way has long been a thing within the natural/curly hair community. While everyone raves about how great it is for textured hair types like mine, I initially shied away from the process. My reticence was down to the fact that most clay-based products I had come across were in pots and masks. For me, these had \u2018messy\u2019 and \u2018high maintenance\u2019 written all over them. Now, however, I am sold. This particular offering, a French pink clay formulation, is wonderful. I immediately fell for the texture and the colour. It feels like a heavy but not stiff conditioner and looks like a strawberry-flavoured Angel Delight. You simply apply it to your hair and your scalp as you would your normal shampoo, and massage it in. It does not foam at all. For anyone who has been indoctrinated to love suds as much as I do, this was slightly disconcerting. So I was sceptical as to whether it would clean my hair. Thankfully it did that and so much more. My curls were detangled, super soft, incredibly defined and stayed that way all week. For those results, I am more than happy to go sud free. On my radar: full lip service, a drop of dew, stylish scents Gold standard I normally turn my nose up at \u2018wearable\u2019 fragrance products, but I love this. A gold-plated necklace with interchangeable perfume vials \u2013 what a gorgeous but practical way to travel with scent.

Life on the high street (or in the former petrol stations, railway arches and other eclectic venues where Majestic have tended to set up shop) was looking too tough for the 40-year-old firm, and its stores were set for a rebranding by its former owners as Naked Wines \u2013 or to be closed down completely. With the company now in the hands of investment firm Fortress, Majestic\u2019s 200 or so stores are safe for now, and the word from head office is that the merchant will be looking to return to its old strengths: focusing more on range than the sometimes gimmicky trading tricks that were such a feature of the Naked years. It\u2019s a development that hopefully means we can expect more wines like the gorgeously floral, ripe, rounded, apricot-scented Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol Viognier.</p> <p><strong>Definition Rioja Reserva, Rioja, Spain 2013 (\u00a313.99, or \u00a311.99 as part of a mix six, <a href=\"http://majestic.co.uk\">Majestic</a>)</strong> Another feature of Majestic\u2019s recent past which may well now fade into the background is the emphasis on own-label wines. From a business point of view, you can understand why retailers are seduced by the practice: if a shop put its own name on the bottle it means they have greater control over who makes it, how it\u2019s made and what price it goes out for \u2013 and it\u2019s much harder to compare prices with other stores. The problem is that it can make for a rather dull and samey-looking set-up if you have too many own-brands; you don\u2019t get the sense of abundance and variety you get, when, say, you\u2019re shopping in a really good independent.

Life on the high street (or in the former petrol stations, railway arches and other eclectic venues where Majestic have tended to set up shop) was looking too tough for the 40-year-old firm, and its stores were set for a rebranding by its former owners as Naked Wines \u2013 or to be closed down completely. With the company now in the hands of investment firm Fortress, Majestic\u2019s 200 or so stores are safe for now, and the word from head office is that the merchant will be looking to return to its old strengths: focusing more on range than the sometimes gimmicky trading tricks that were such a feature of the Naked years. It\u2019s a development that hopefully means we can expect more wines like the gorgeously floral, ripe, rounded, apricot-scented Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol Viognier. Definition Rioja Reserva, Rioja, Spain 2013 (\u00a313.99, or \u00a311.99 as part of a mix six, Majestic) Another feature of Majestic\u2019s recent past which may well now fade into the background is the emphasis on own-label wines. From a business point of view, you can understand why retailers are seduced by the practice: if a shop put its own name on the bottle it means they have greater control over who makes it, how it\u2019s made and what price it goes out for \u2013 and it\u2019s much harder to compare prices with other stores. The problem is that it can make for a rather dull and samey-looking set-up if you have too many own-brands; you don\u2019t get the sense of abundance and variety you get, when, say, you\u2019re shopping in a really good independent. Not that all the Majestic own-brands were bad by any means.

      "body": "<p>In 1881 John Singer Sargent, then 25 and based in Paris, submitted his first portrait to the Royal Academy. Entitled <em>Dr Pozzi</em><em> at </em><em>Home</em>, it was a remarkable full-length study of a young, bearded man in a long crimson robe in front of a set of luxuriant burgundy velvet curtains. The sensual, sanguinary colour scheme seemed made for the subject. Samuel Jean de Pozzi, who enjoyed great celebrity in the Parisian belle epoque, was a society surgeon, a world-renowned pioneer of gynaecology, and an equally notorious womaniser.</p> <p>The actress <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/05/sarah-bernhardt-back-in-london-daniel-1921\" title=\"\">Sarah Bernhardt,</a> on whom he operated, and with whom he enjoyed a love affair and lifelong friendship, called him \u201cDr Dieu\u201d, Dr God, after Pozzi successfully removed from her an ovarian cyst, which was \u201cthe size of the head of a 14-year-old\u201d. He was known more widely among patients and paramours as \u201cL\u2019amour m\u00e9decin\u201d \u2013 Dr Love.</p> <p>Julian Barnes saw Sargent\u2019s portrait of Pozzi when it was on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to the National Portrait Gallery in 2015. Barnes was struck first by that decadent crimson dressing-gown and then by the life of its occupant, a man, he confesses, about whom he knew nothing, despite his avid interest in the period. That initial curiosity led eventually to this enjoyably obsessive study of Pozzi, in which the doctor comes to life among a vivid circle of artists and libertines, including the irrepressible aesthete Count Robert de Montesquiou, (known by his friend Marcel Proust as \u201cthe professor of beauty\u201d), his sometime enemy the wolfish scandal-monger, writer and duellist Jean Lorrain, and a revolving cast of friends and sparring partners including the free-loving Bernhardt and Oscar Wilde, Sargent and James MacNeill Whistler.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pozzi proves an illuminating figure ... a politician and senator as well as a precociously talented surgeon</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The circle collected art, dressed up, gossiped ferociously, quarrelled, painted portraits, wrote confessions, and indulged in every available physical pleasure.

      "bodyText": "In 1881 John Singer Sargent, then 25 and based in Paris, submitted his first portrait to the Royal Academy. Entitled Dr Pozzi at Home, it was a remarkable full-length study of a young, bearded man in a long crimson robe in front of a set of luxuriant burgundy velvet curtains. The sensual, sanguinary colour scheme seemed made for the subject. Samuel Jean de Pozzi, who enjoyed great celebrity in the Parisian belle epoque, was a society surgeon, a world-renowned pioneer of gynaecology, and an equally notorious womaniser. The actress Sarah Bernhardt, on whom he operated, and with whom he enjoyed a love affair and lifelong friendship, called him \u201cDr Dieu\u201d, Dr God, after Pozzi successfully removed from her an ovarian cyst, which was \u201cthe size of the head of a 14-year-old\u201d. He was known more widely among patients and paramours as \u201cL\u2019amour m\u00e9decin\u201d \u2013 Dr Love. Julian Barnes saw Sargent\u2019s portrait of Pozzi when it was on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to the National Portrait Gallery in 2015. Barnes was struck first by that decadent crimson dressing-gown and then by the life of its occupant, a man, he confesses, about whom he knew nothing, despite his avid interest in the period. That initial curiosity led eventually to this enjoyably obsessive study of Pozzi, in which the doctor comes to life among a vivid circle of artists and libertines, including the irrepressible aesthete Count Robert de Montesquiou, (known by his friend Marcel Proust as \u201cthe professor of beauty\u201d), his sometime enemy the wolfish scandal-monger, writer and duellist Jean Lorrain, and a revolving cast of friends and sparring partners including the free-loving Bernhardt and Oscar Wilde, Sargent and James MacNeill Whistler. The circle collected art, dressed up, gossiped ferociously, quarrelled, painted portraits, wrote confessions, and indulged in every available physical pleasure. A scandalous roman \u00e0 clef A Rebours, (Against Nature) about Montesquiou featured in the Old Bailey trial of Oscar Wilde, in which the playwright repeatedly refused to condemn what was characterised by the prosecution as a \u201csodomitical book\u201d, except on the grounds that it was poorly written. In Barnes\u2019s lavishly illustrated account, Pozzi proves an illuminating figure in this rare company. He was a politician and senator as well as a precociously talented surgeon, first specialising in gunshot wounds. As surgical director of a public city hospital he brought innovations in antiseptics and anaesthesia to Paris, and invited artist friends to decorate the walls of the wards with murals. He transformed the practice of gynaecology, setting the first guidelines to a woman\u2019s comfort in examination, and writing a definitive two-volume treatise that established the specialism in its own right. He found time to translate Darwin, become a connoisseur of all manner of art, travel extensively to everywhere from Buenos Aires to Beirut and became a lieutenant-colonel in the Great War. Pozzi was, throughout his life, a man of apparently boundless charm, \u201cdisgustingly handsome\u201d in the words of Alice, Princesse de Monaco. A couple of years before the Sargent portrait, Pozzi had married Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Loth-Cazalis, a \u201cprovincial virgin of 23\u201d, heiress to a family that had made a sudden fortune from the railways. They had three children. The eldest, Catherine, a novelist and compulsive diarist, provides Barnes with invaluable insights into her parents\u2019 unhappy marriage, and a shifting, intimate commentary of her father\u2019s prodigious abilities and flagrant infidelities. All of these appetites and achievements were set against a backdrop of great political volatility. France at the end of the 19th century was divided by a rise in \u201cblood and soil nativism\u201d stoked by propaganda against foreign influence. That despised \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d found its most dandified expression in Pozzi\u2019s circle. The fault line was the Dreyfus case, which exposed a vicious culture war between conservative Catholic nationalists, and the freer-thinking, looser-living European liberals of the cities. The battle of ideas was characterised by fake news, confrontation between opinion writers, and occasional violence and riot. Pozzi, of Italian heritage, a subtle linguist, amused anglophile and atheist, was a natural Dreyfusard, sitting alongside Sarah Bernhardt at the trials. Writing this book during what he describes in an afterword as Britain\u2019s \u201cdeluded masochistic departure from the European Union\u201d, Barnes understands the parallels with our present fractured politics only too well. Dr Love\u2019s most-quoted maxim, he notes, declared that \u201cchauvinism is one of the forms of ignorance\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The best laugh in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/wework\" title=\"\">WeWork</a> farce \u2013 better even than the loss-making property company\u2019s claim to be \u201celevating the world\u2019s consciousness\u201d \u2013 was provided by Masayoshi Son, founder of Softbank, the Japanese investment firm that largely bankrolled the venture and has now rescued it from collapse. Reflecting on failures during his career, Son said last week that \u201cthe small crises that pop up here and there today are mere child\u2019s play\u201d.</p> <p>One can understand what he was getting at, of course. Softbank has backed some big successes over the years \u2013 notably Alibaba, the huge Chinese online retailer \u2013 so you can\u2019t blame Son for defending the idea that an occasional loss is part of the game when you\u2019re in the business of spotting visionaries who can transform entire industries. He is, after all, still trying to raise $100bn for a second Softbank-led \u201cVision\u201d fund.</p> <p>Come on, though: the WeWork flop is more than a hiccup. The tale belongs in \u201cwhat were you smoking?\u201d territory. WeWork was never the type of next-generation technology company that is supposed to be a target for Softbank\u2019s money. It\u2019s a company that rents out offices and sub-leases the space to tenants, a business model that isn\u2019t remotely novel. The London stock market has boasted one example for years \u2013 IWG, the old Regus group, which, unlike WeWork, makes hard profits, generates cash and pays dividends.</p> <p>The only true point of difference at WeWork was the presence of Adam Neumann, the charismatic co-founder with a talent for self-promotion. Maybe Son, before he read <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-is-not-the-way-everybody-behaves-how-adam-neumanns-over-the-top-style-built-wework-11568823827?reflink=share_mobilewebshare\" title=\"\">the <em>Wall Street Journal\u2019s</em> profile</a> in the midst of the IPO debacle, was unaware that Neumann had expressed an ambition to live for ever and run for \u201cpresident of the world\u201d. But he did presumably know that WeWork, absurdly, had paid almost $6m to Neumann for the rights to the trademarked word \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 a clue that governance might be a little lax.</p> <p>Lest we forget, the original IPO prospectus was stuffed with other governance red flags. If Neumann were to fall short of immortality and die in office, his wife would have a say in picking his successor. In the meantime, his shares would carry 20 times the votes of the ordinary equity. It read like a cult of personality.</p> <p>This was a business that reported a net loss of $1.6bn in 2018 on revenues of $1.8bn. Yet Softbank, in the last private funding round, had injected the last portion of its investment at a valuation of $47bn (\u00a337bn). Baffled outsiders screamed that it made no financial sense, especially as bigger and profitable IWG was sitting around the \u00a33bn mark, but Son went ahead.</p> <p>He knows the price of his misjudgment now. In last week\u2019s rescue deal, WeWork was valued at $8bn and Softbank had to throw in another $6.5bn in equity and debt to gain control. Neumann agreed to sell his shares and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/22/wework-board-weighs-up-10bn-rescue-plan-from-softbank\" title=\"\">will walk away with roughly $1.7bn</a>. It\u2019s not hard to identify the winner and loser in that relationship.</p> <p>Another winner is the reputation of public-market investors. Wall Street tends to love larger-than-life personalities pitching visions of global expansion and domination, but Neumann didn\u2019t get off first base. WeWork went from publication of grand IPO prospectus to emergency rescue in two months. Gravity rarely reasserts itself so quickly in financial markets.</p> <p>That is why this is more than a \u201csmall crisis\u201d for Softbank and Son. The IPO roadshow was an embarrassment from start to finish, and the long-term impact may only emerge when Softbank tries to sell its next \u201cvisionary\u201d offering. After WeWork, fund managers have learned that private market valuations can be more than merely optimistic \u2013 they can come from a parallel universe.</p> <h2>Draghi fires a warning shot at the Germans</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/24/germany-eurozone-stagnation-economy-output-recession\" title=\"\">Mario Draghi\u2019s parting shot</a> as president of the European Central Bank was a warning about the knock-on effects of a global slowdown and how they could trigger another financial crash.</p> <p>Like most central bankers, he used more ambiguous language when giving his final press conference following the ECB\u2019s October policy decision. Yet the warning was clear enough. What he actually said was: \u201cThe main risk from all viewpoints, but especially also from a financial stability viewpoint, is a downturn in the economy ... whether it is global or it is eurozone.\u201d</p> <p>As so often, Germany was his target. It is Europe\u2019s largest economy and its laws stop politicians from opening the public-spending taps before a recession \u2013 or two quarters of consecutive contraction \u2013 is officially declared.</p> <p>The slowdown in Germany so far has brought one quarterly decline of 0.1%, which is crippling, but not enough to unleash a \u20ac50bn stimulus package that chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s ministers have put together and is waiting in the wings.</p> <p>In the meantime, Germans make the situation worse by saving more than they spend, storing up funds for their retirement. Admittedly, they don\u2019t get much return on their savings now the ECB has cut the eurozone deposit rate to -0.5%, which savers grumble about while stashing away even more funds to make up the shortfall.</p> <p>What do Germans buy with their savings? Too many buy assets with shaky foundations. And what happens when GDP growth dries up? The world\u2019s banks and finance companies become vulnerable, just as they were in 2008.</p> <p>Draghi denies that his negative interest rate policies are in any way to blame. He says low rates keep the economy moving and, as long as that happens, the finance sector is safe. So his warning is to populist politicians, who can wreck any chance of escape with their trade wars and prolonged austerity. They should listen. Another financial crash is only a few bad decisions away.</p> <h2>Barclays should stump up for post office services</h2> <p>It\u2019s funny how the threat of being dragged before a committee of hostile MPs can make even the most intransigent boss see sense.</p> <p>Seven hours before the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee was due to publish <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-energy-industrial-strategy/news-parliament-2017/post-office-network-report-published-19-20/\" title=\"\">a report</a> attacking Barclays\u2019s decision to stop customers from withdrawing cash at post offices, and revealing it would be hauling in the bosses to face tough questions, the bank blinked and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/24/barclays-bosses-to-face-questions-after-ending-post-office-withdrawals\" title=\"\">performed a crunching U-turn</a>. It said it had been \u201cpersuaded to rethink\u201d its decision and would now be keeping the cash withdrawal facility after all.</p> <p>From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/08/barclays-withdraw-cash-post-offices\" title=\"\">the moment it announced its original decision</a> to scrap over-the-counter cash withdrawals at Post Office branches, Barclays had faced a deluge of criticism. But that appointment with MPs was never going to be pleasant for the bank, and Barclays has form when it comes to disastrous appearances before Commons committees: in 2003, its then chief executive, Matt Barrett, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/17/uk.creditcards\" title=\"\">stunned everyone with his Gerald Ratner-esque admission</a> that he didn\u2019t use a Barclaycard or any other credit card to borrow money \u201cbecause it\u2019s too expensive\u201d? So what on earth possessed the bank to announce it was withdrawing access to cash in the first place? It was the only one out of 28 UK banks to take this position.</p> <p>It seems Barclays was keen to make a stand against a chunky rise in the bank-funded fees paid to post offices for their services. Presumably it also wanted to send a signal to the government to come forward with a proper funding commitment for the post office network. It is true that under the new deal between the Post Office and the 28 banks, postmasters and postmistresses will receive about three times more money for providing banking services than under the previous arrangement. But there needed to be a better financial deal for them, most of whom are self-employed small business owners \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/15/one-in-five-uk-post-offices-could-close-in-next-year-survey-finds\" title=\"\">as recently asin April this year, evidence emerged</a> that many are working for less than the national minimum wage, and some are handing back the keys because they can\u2019t make ends meet.</p> <p>And why shouldn\u2019t they be properly paid for providing banking services when banks decide to abandon communities by shutting branches? Barclays has <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/money/banking/switching-your-bank/bank-branch-closures-is-your-local-bank-closing-a28n44c8z0h5\" title=\"\">closed at least 481 branches since 2015</a>, according to the consumer body Which?. Somewhat damningly, Which? adds on its website that \u201cthe figure for Barclays is likely to be underestimated because they are not willing to share complete closure information with us\u201d.</p>",

It\u2019s a company that rents out offices and sub-leases the space to tenants, a business model that isn\u2019t remotely novel. The London stock market has boasted one example for years \u2013 IWG, the old Regus group, which, unlike WeWork, makes hard profits, generates cash and pays dividends. The only true point of difference at WeWork was the presence of Adam Neumann, the charismatic co-founder with a talent for self-promotion. Maybe Son, before he read the Wall Street Journal\u2019s profile in the midst of the IPO debacle, was unaware that Neumann had expressed an ambition to live for ever and run for \u201cpresident of the world\u201d. But he did presumably know that WeWork, absurdly, had paid almost $6m to Neumann for the rights to the trademarked word \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 a clue that governance might be a little lax. Lest we forget, the original IPO prospectus was stuffed with other governance red flags. If Neumann were to fall short of immortality and die in office, his wife would have a say in picking his successor. In the meantime, his shares would carry 20 times the votes of the ordinary equity. It read like a cult of personality. This was a business that reported a net loss of $1.6bn in 2018 on revenues of $1.8bn. Yet Softbank, in the last private funding round, had injected the last portion of its investment at a valuation of $47bn (\u00a337bn). Baffled outsiders screamed that it made no financial sense, especially as bigger and profitable IWG was sitting around the \u00a33bn mark, but Son went ahead. He knows the price of his misjudgment now. In last week\u2019s rescue deal, WeWork was valued at $8bn and Softbank had to throw in another $6.5bn in equity and debt to gain control. Neumann agreed to sell his shares and will walk away with roughly $1.7bn. It\u2019s not hard to identify the winner and loser in that relationship. Another winner is the reputation of public-market investors. Wall Street tends to love larger-than-life personalities pitching visions of global expansion and domination, but Neumann didn\u2019t get off first base. WeWork went from publication of grand IPO prospectus to emergency rescue in two months. Gravity rarely reasserts itself so quickly in financial markets. That is why this is more than a \u201csmall crisis\u201d for Softbank and Son. The IPO roadshow was an embarrassment from start to finish, and the long-term impact may only emerge when Softbank tries to sell its next \u201cvisionary\u201d offering. After WeWork, fund managers have learned that private market valuations can be more than merely optimistic \u2013 they can come from a parallel universe. Draghi fires a warning shot at the Germans Mario Draghi\u2019s parting shot as president of the European Central Bank was a warning about the knock-on effects of a global slowdown and how they could trigger another financial crash. Like most central bankers, he used more ambiguous language when giving his final press conference following the ECB\u2019s October policy decision. Yet the warning was clear enough. What he actually said was: \u201cThe main risk from all viewpoints, but especially also from a financial stability viewpoint, is a downturn in the economy ... whether it is global or it is eurozone.\u201d As so often, Germany was his target. It is Europe\u2019s largest economy and its laws stop politicians from opening the public-spending taps before a recession \u2013 or two quarters of consecutive contraction \u2013 is officially declared. The slowdown in Germany so far has brought one quarterly decline of 0.1%, which is crippling, but not enough to unleash a \u20ac50bn stimulus package that chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s ministers have put together and is waiting in the wings. In the meantime, Germans make the situation worse by saving more than they spend, storing up funds for their retirement. Admittedly, they don\u2019t get much return on their savings now the ECB has cut the eurozone deposit rate to -0.5%, which savers grumble about while stashing away even more funds to make up the shortfall. What do Germans buy with their savings? Too many buy assets with shaky foundations. And what happens when GDP growth dries up? The world\u2019s banks and finance companies become vulnerable, just as they were in 2008. Draghi denies that his negative interest rate policies are in any way to blame. He says low rates keep the economy moving and, as long as that happens, the finance sector is safe. So his warning is to populist politicians, who can wreck any chance of escape with their trade wars and prolonged austerity. They should listen. Another financial crash is only a few bad decisions away. Barclays should stump up for post office services It\u2019s funny how the threat of being dragged before a committee of hostile MPs can make even the most intransigent boss see sense. Seven hours before the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee was due to publish a report attacking Barclays\u2019s decision to stop customers from withdrawing cash at post offices, and revealing it would be hauling in the bosses to face tough questions, the bank blinked and performed a crunching U-turn. It said it had been \u201cpersuaded to rethink\u201d its decision and would now be keeping the cash withdrawal facility after all. From the moment it announced its original decision to scrap over-the-counter cash withdrawals at Post Office branches, Barclays had faced a deluge of criticism. But that appointment with MPs was never going to be pleasant for the bank, and Barclays has form when it comes to disastrous appearances before Commons committees: in 2003, its then chief executive, Matt Barrett, stunned everyone with his Gerald Ratner-esque admission that he didn\u2019t use a Barclaycard or any other credit card to borrow money \u201cbecause it\u2019s too expensive\u201d? So what on earth possessed the bank to announce it was withdrawing access to cash in the first place? It was the only one out of 28 UK banks to take this position. It seems Barclays was keen to make a stand against a chunky rise in the bank-funded fees paid to post offices for their services. Presumably it also wanted to send a signal to the government to come forward with a proper funding commitment for the post office network. It is true that under the new deal between the Post Office and the 28 banks, postmasters and postmistresses will receive about three times more money for providing banking services than under the previous arrangement. But there needed to be a better financial deal for them, most of whom are self-employed small business owners \u2013 as recently asin April this year, evidence emerged that many are working for less than the national minimum wage, and some are handing back the keys because they can\u2019t make ends meet. And why shouldn\u2019t they be properly paid for providing banking services when banks decide to abandon communities by shutting branches? Barclays has closed at least 481 branches since 2015, according to the consumer body Which?. Somewhat damningly, Which? adds on its website that \u201cthe figure for Barclays is likely to be underestimated because they are not willing to share complete closure information with us\u201d.",

Yes, they share qualities. They are usually single rooms, basically furnished, and decorated in shades which run the whole gamut from white to off-cream. They have short menus, written in a clipped prose. The prices are eminently reasonable. If you want a three-course lunch, a really good one that will make you sigh and feel sorry for the friends who are not with you, one which will almost certainly give you change from \u00a320 for food, go to Bristol.</p> <p>After that, however, they all have their own quirks and idiosyncrasies and personalities. In any case, none of these characteristics should be described as exotic. They are the starting points for a good meal out. They direct you down to the food on the plate.

One draws romantically on the radical traditions of the city, which fosters a culture of the independent against the corporate, but I\u2019m not quite up to the task of finding the correct historical references to back this up. More compelling is the fact that slabs of the independent TV industry have relocated to the city from London over the past couple of decades, to comply with production quotas from outside the capital. Here come the producers, fed fat on the trattorias of London\u2019s Charlotte Street, determined to carry on lunching well. They have provided a burning heart of reliable custom from which to build on. Or maybe the good people of Bristol just have far better taste than those of other towns in the United Kingdom. Let\u2019s go with that.</p> <p>For here is <a href=\"https://www.marmo.restaurant\" title=\"\">Marmo</a>, the Italian for marble. It is indeed a high-ceilinged white box of a room, hung with a few food and wine posters. At the back is a compact open kitchen, staffed by just two cooks for most of our lunch.

There are some snacks, including Cetara anchovies to go with the bread, at \u00a35 for a plateful, or smoked cod\u2019s roe. We ask for the pork crackling and hear the anticipatory fizz of the deep fat fryer as the two sheets of dehydrated skin are puffed, to be served still warm and spice-dusted with a scoop of quince jelly to drag them through.</p> <p>After that it\u2019s a choice of three dishes at each course: one meaty, one pescatarian and one vegetarian. Have just a main course and it will cost you a tenner. Add a starter and it rises to \u00a314. Throw in dessert and you\u2019ll reach the dizzy heights of \u00a317. At dinner the menu is longer and the dishes individually priced, but it is still tough to break through \u00a330 for the food element.</p> <p>How do they keep the prices so low? At lunch, by bolstering many of the plates with carbs, though not in a way that looks cheapskate. Only our starter of mussels with finely shredded leeks and a cider butter broth does not depend upon them. Pick up the spoon and make sure not a drop of that liquor goes back to the kitchen. Folds of mortadella, the pink of a giggling baby\u2019s cheek, come layered over gnocco fritto, those pork fat-enriched pillows of bread, puffed up in the fryer.

      "bodyText": "Marmo, 31 Baldwin Street, Bristol BS1 1RG (0117 316 4987). Lunch: two courses \u00a314, three courses \u00a317. Dinner: starters \u00a37.50-\u00a39, mains \u00a313.50-\u00a318, desserts \u00a36, wines from \u00a317.50 I\u2019m beginning to wonder whether they breed them in tanks, these small, perfectly formed Bristolian restaurants. But that makes them sound like Identikit operations, a catering version of the cabled-up podded bodies in The Matrix, which they are not. Yes, they share qualities. They are usually single rooms, basically furnished, and decorated in shades which run the whole gamut from white to off-cream. They have short menus, written in a clipped prose. The prices are eminently reasonable. If you want a three-course lunch, a really good one that will make you sigh and feel sorry for the friends who are not with you, one which will almost certainly give you change from \u00a320 for food, go to Bristol. After that, however, they all have their own quirks and idiosyncrasies and personalities. In any case, none of these characteristics should be described as exotic. They are the starting points for a good meal out. They direct you down to the food on the plate. And lucky Bristol has a bunch of them: from trailblazers such as Flinty Red and Wilsons, though to Box-E, Pasta Loco and Ripiena. Now there\u2019s Bianchi\u2019s, Pasture, Kensington Arms, Cauldron, the recently relaunched Ethicurean and more\u2026 What\u2019s remarkable is not that these restaurants are opened but that, for the most part, they stay open. (Yes, I know; RIP the lovely Wallfish). The people of Bristol support their independents. There are theories. One draws romantically on the radical traditions of the city, which fosters a culture of the independent against the corporate, but I\u2019m not quite up to the task of finding the correct historical references to back this up. More compelling is the fact that slabs of the independent TV industry have relocated to the city from London over the past couple of decades, to comply with production quotas from outside the capital. Here come the producers, fed fat on the trattorias of London\u2019s Charlotte Street, determined to carry on lunching well. They have provided a burning heart of reliable custom from which to build on. Or maybe the good people of Bristol just have far better taste than those of other towns in the United Kingdom. Let\u2019s go with that. For here is Marmo, the Italian for marble. It is indeed a high-ceilinged white box of a room, hung with a few food and wine posters. At the back is a compact open kitchen, staffed by just two cooks for most of our lunch. The new venture belongs to Cosmo and Lily Sterck, who met at the city\u2019s university. Cosmo cut his teeth in the kitchens of St John, Magdalen and Brawn. Lily ran away from the law to join the circus front of house at Six Portland Road and Luca. They know what they are doing. Now they are doing it here. The menu at lunch is almost self-consciously short. There are some snacks, including Cetara anchovies to go with the bread, at \u00a35 for a plateful, or smoked cod\u2019s roe. We ask for the pork crackling and hear the anticipatory fizz of the deep fat fryer as the two sheets of dehydrated skin are puffed, to be served still warm and spice-dusted with a scoop of quince jelly to drag them through. After that it\u2019s a choice of three dishes at each course: one meaty, one pescatarian and one vegetarian. Have just a main course and it will cost you a tenner. Add a starter and it rises to \u00a314. Throw in dessert and you\u2019ll reach the dizzy heights of \u00a317. At dinner the menu is longer and the dishes individually priced, but it is still tough to break through \u00a330 for the food element. How do they keep the prices so low? At lunch, by bolstering many of the plates with carbs, though not in a way that looks cheapskate. Only our starter of mussels with finely shredded leeks and a cider butter broth does not depend upon them. Pick up the spoon and make sure not a drop of that liquor goes back to the kitchen. Folds of mortadella, the pink of a giggling baby\u2019s cheek, come layered over gnocco fritto, those pork fat-enriched pillows of bread, puffed up in the fryer. The plating gives you permission to use your hands to wrap one across the other. Get on with it. Two of the mains are based around their own pasta. There is pumpkin ravioli with sage and walnuts.

And she was very, very sensitive. \u201cI try to go back to my life, a normal life, but it\u2019s not easy, because every place I go, every young girl I see, I remember Aiia.\u201d",

Said differently, if you can actually believe Barack Obama is a crypto-Muslim born in Kenya to a cocaine-addled Martian, then opting in to at least 50% of All the President\u2019s Women should be a no-brainer.</p> <p>Court records abound. It is not just the authors\u2019 word or a birth certificate. Think Summer Zervos, Michael Cohen and \u201cIndividual-1\u201d for starters.</p> <p>Despite all Trump\u2019s protestations and legal maneuvers, the lawsuit commenced in New York by Zervos, a one-time Apprentice contestant who was allegedly manhandled and defamed, proceeds apace. Since the case began in early 2017, the defendant has never submitted a sworn statement denying the substance of the complaint.</p> <p>In March 2019, a New York appeals court <a href=\"https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=la6J8d4RPduy48uU8uvlSg==\">gave its greenlight</a> for Zervos\u2019s action to continue. Earlier this month the trial court set <a href=\"https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=OYHadPE_PLUS_v4TWd7y2aA15zg==\">a 6 December discovery cut-off</a>, with the possibility of Trump being deposed.</p> <p>Practically speaking, don\u2019t bet on it. Like Bill Clinton before him, Trump will probably continue to assert that a sitting president cannot be sued, an argument <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/681/\">rejected by the supreme court</a> when Clinton squared off against Paula Jones. It is also possible Trump will claim that being deposed while being impeached is more than one man should be forced to bear. There, he may have a point.</p> <p>More ominously for Trump, on Thursday Zervos filed a motion with the court that outlined <a href=\"https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=r38zWzZu6xabjSWEJWfQdA==\">a series of sexual assaults in late 2007</a> allegedly perpetrated by Trump. For good measure, <a href=\"https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=qcH2CvMF5cXg1Jjs5lI_PLUS_Gw==\">the results of a polygraph</a> are included. <a href=\"https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=ptpCsZeVr9ERcvEvQUuJxg==\">According to Zervos</a>, in one instance Trump \u201cbegan kissing\u201d her \u201cvery aggressively\u201d, then pawed at her. Zervos also attached portions of <a href=\"https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=qRGLlbNG1KISpC1kM9ds3Q==\">Trump\u2019s calendar</a>. Barron Trump, the president\u2019s son with Melania, was less than two years old at the time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is unlikely All the President\u2019s Women will change many, if any, minds about Trump</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On top of that, there is Cohen\u2019s guilty plea that essentially paints the president AKA \u201cIndividual-1\u201d as an <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1088966/download\">unindicted co-conspirator</a> in a campaign finance scheme to keep <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=26&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwik0pqp4a3lAhWoc98KHWRiB1sQFjAZegQIABAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2018%2Fmar%2F23%2Fformer-playboy-model-karen-mcdougal-says-trump-offered-cash-after-sex&amp;usg=AOvVaw3AqeELd8Y0zgfNXg5Ma1Qs\">Karen McDougal</a>, a former Playboy model (\u201cWoman-1\u201d), and Daniels, a porn star (\u201cWoman-2\u201d), out of the headlines. The plan worked well enough. The two women were neither seen nor heard until the presidential race was over.</p> <p>Among the book\u2019s more questionable vignettes is a story of a younger Trump, nearly 40 years ago, frequenting a sex club maintained by the mob and <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/all-the-presidents-women-makes-explosive-claim-about-trump-and-a-seedy-times-square-threesome\">pursuing a threesome</a> with a porn star and a young girl. The authors have failed to find the two women or a possible black-and-white tape.</p> <p>Beyond that, the building in question has since been demolished and the mob kingpin behind the club was purportedly whacked in 1986. The sole eyewitness is named John Tino, and his rap sheet includes convictions for larceny, fraud and forgery.</p> <p>Yet Trump\u2019s forays into construction and casinos, his nexus to organized crime and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein together confer a patina of plausibility on a tale that would otherwise be close to nonexistent. The authors stand by Tino.</p> <p>The book also raises the possibility Trump may have left in his wake more than a few terminated pregnancies. David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer prize winner and a Trump biographer, is quoted as saying that several \u201cname-brand\u201d women had pregnancies and abortions courtesy of Trump.

      "bodyText": "Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy parachute into the netherworld of weaponized libido that is the life of the 45th president. Salaciousness abounds. Their book is lurid, informative and aptly subtitled \u201cDonald Trump and the Making of a Predator\u201d. Fortunately for us, the authors bring unique expertise. Levine is a former executive editor of the National Enquirer. According to the investigative reporter Ronan Farrow, Trump\u2019s secrets were stashed in a safe in Levine\u2019s office until they were shredded in December 2016 \u2013 a claim the Enquirer denies. El-Faizy is the author of God and Country, which examined the rise of the evangelical community in the aftermath of George W Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election. All the President\u2019s Women is breezy but heavy. Unlike Stormy Daniels\u2019 2018 bestseller Full Disclosure, none of it is entertaining. Not surprisingly, the White House declined multiple opportunities to rebut the book\u2019s contentions. It takes us from Trump\u2019s days growing up in Queens to his arrival in the Oval Office and chronicles everything in between, mommy and daughter issues included. Much has been heard before, some is aired for the first time, little is pleasant, plenty is disturbing. The book rests upon firsthand interviews, transcripts and prior reports. It also contains a detailed appendix that lays out its sources. Said differently, if you can actually believe Barack Obama is a crypto-Muslim born in Kenya to a cocaine-addled Martian, then opting in to at least 50% of All the President\u2019s Women should be a no-brainer. Court records abound. It is not just the authors\u2019 word or a birth certificate. Think Summer Zervos, Michael Cohen and \u201cIndividual-1\u201d for starters. Despite all Trump\u2019s protestations and legal maneuvers, the lawsuit commenced in New York by Zervos, a one-time Apprentice contestant who was allegedly manhandled and defamed, proceeds apace. Since the case began in early 2017, the defendant has never submitted a sworn statement denying the substance of the complaint. In March 2019, a New York appeals court gave its greenlight for Zervos\u2019s action to continue. Earlier this month the trial court set a 6 December discovery cut-off, with the possibility of Trump being deposed. Practically speaking, don\u2019t bet on it. Like Bill Clinton before him, Trump will probably continue to assert that a sitting president cannot be sued, an argument rejected by the supreme court when Clinton squared off against Paula Jones. It is also possible Trump will claim that being deposed while being impeached is more than one man should be forced to bear. There, he may have a point. More ominously for Trump, on Thursday Zervos filed a motion with the court that outlined a series of sexual assaults in late 2007 allegedly perpetrated by Trump. For good measure, the results of a polygraph are included. According to Zervos, in one instance Trump \u201cbegan kissing\u201d her \u201cvery aggressively\u201d, then pawed at her. Zervos also attached portions of Trump\u2019s calendar. Barron Trump, the president\u2019s son with Melania, was less than two years old at the time. On top of that, there is Cohen\u2019s guilty plea that essentially paints the president AKA \u201cIndividual-1\u201d as an unindicted co-conspirator in a campaign finance scheme to keep Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model (\u201cWoman-1\u201d), and Daniels, a porn star (\u201cWoman-2\u201d), out of the headlines. The plan worked well enough. The two women were neither seen nor heard until the presidential race was over. Among the book\u2019s more questionable vignettes is a story of a younger Trump, nearly 40 years ago, frequenting a sex club maintained by the mob and pursuing a threesome with a porn star and a young girl. The authors have failed to find the two women or a possible black-and-white tape. Beyond that, the building in question has since been demolished and the mob kingpin behind the club was purportedly whacked in 1986. The sole eyewitness is named John Tino, and his rap sheet includes convictions for larceny, fraud and forgery. Yet Trump\u2019s forays into construction and casinos, his nexus to organized crime and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein together confer a patina of plausibility on a tale that would otherwise be close to nonexistent. The authors stand by Tino. The book also raises the possibility Trump may have left in his wake more than a few terminated pregnancies. David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer prize winner and a Trump biographer, is quoted as saying that several \u201cname-brand\u201d women had pregnancies and abortions courtesy of Trump. Johnston adds: \u201cI don\u2019t have the medical records to prove it, but they\u2019ve told girlfriends about it.\u201d No names are listed. All the President\u2019s Women also examines evangelical support for Trump and Trump\u2019s religious life. One source is quoted as saying evangelical backing stems from Trump\u2019s judicial selections. Another attributes it to the loss of \u201cProtestant privilege in America\u201d. On that score, Pew Research recently announced: \u201cIn US, Decline of Christianity Continues at Rapid Pace\u201d. Just over two in five Americans are Protestants and evangelical Protestantism is now the dominant branch. At the same time, the religiously unaffiliated comprise more than a quarter of the country. Potentially more telling is that Paula White, a preacher of the prosperity gospel, has emerged as Trump\u2019s personal pastor. White\u2019s take on immigration and Scripture: Jesus \u201cdid live in Egypt for three and a half years. But it was not illegal.

      "body": "<p>I was on a train by myself on a warm summer day, wearing a knee-length skirt. An Asian male guard in his 50s was walking down the train. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t sit like that, I can see everything,\u201d he hissed at me. The implication was that I was some kind of hussy for sitting in a skirt, legs bare and uncrossed. It\u2019s far from my only run-in with rank misogyny, but I bawled when I got home. I knew the guard wouldn\u2019t have said that to me had I been white, that he felt he had the right to police me because of our shared skin colour. It made my sense of disgust at his behaviour more acute.</p> <p>I was reminded of this last week when I read Labour MP Naz Shah\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NazShahBfd/status/1186744130808041478?s=20\" title=\"\">powerful account</a> of Salma Yaqoob\u2019s complicity in the toxic misogyny directed at her by a vocal minority of Muslim men in the 2017 Bradford West election. Yaqoob, the former leader of the Respect party, has just been <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2019/10/salma-yaqoob-shortlisted-for-labours-west-midlands-mayoral-selection/\" title=\"\">shortlisted</a> by Labour as a candidate for West Midlands mayor. \u201cHer campaign created a platform which allowed men to literally slut shame me,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NazShahBfd/status/1186744130808041478?s=20\" title=\"\">Shah says</a>, leaving her feeling suicidal.</p> <p>It takes an understanding of the <em>biraderi</em>, or clan, politics that have historically dominated some south Asian communities to fully grasp why the actions of Yaqoob, who ran as an independent against Shah, were so insidious. From the 1960s onwards in places such as east London, Birmingham and Bradford, local Labour politicians developed mutually beneficial relationships with self-appointed \u201ccommunity leaders\u201d from Asian immigrant communities.</p> <p>Labour councils funded their organisations to provide services as a way of managing growing diversity and became increasingly dependent on community leaders for electoral support, relying on kinship bloc voting, in which older men ensured everyone in their extended network voted the same way. The effect has been to give huge power to those men while marginalising women and young people. A <em>Newsnight</em> investigation in 2016 interviewed a number of Muslim women who said their attempts to get involved in Labour politics were thwarted by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35504185\" title=\"\">men within their community</a>.</p> <p>The sense of disenchantment this engendered among young Muslims was one factor behind George Galloway\u2019s victory for Respect in the Bradford West byelection of 2012. After that, Labour decided its next candidate would be from an <a href=\"https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/blog/de-mystifying-biraderi-politics-bradford\" title=\"\">all-women shortlist</a>. But any woman fighting that seat was bound to face a hostile ride. The first to be selected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/25/labour-candidate-chosen-to-face-galloway-resigns-after-three-days\" title=\"\">withdrew just days afterwards</a>.</p> <p>Enter Naz Shah, bravest of feminists. Her story is extraordinary. She was propelled into the role of domestic violence campaigner as a teenager after her mother was jailed for 15 years for <a href=\"https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politics/mp-naz-shah-whose-mother-was-jailed-for-killing-her-abuser-speaks-passionately-on-tackling-domestic-abuse-1-10030380\" title=\"\">killing the man who sexually enslaved her (the mother)</a>. A few years earlier, her mother had sent 12-year-old Shah to Pakistan to protect her from her abuser. Shah was forced to marry a <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2015/07/victory-my-mother-s-too\" title=\"\">much older cousin</a>, whom she later divorced. A woman for these reasons considered \u201cdishonoured\u201d by a small number of toxic men in her community, Shah had a tough time fighting Galloway in 2015 and has spoken about the nasty <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35839823\" title=\"\">attempts to smear her</a>. But she found the 2017 campaign even worse after Yaqoob entered the race, even though Shah says Yaqoob had previously agreed to stay out of it after she spoke to her about the patriarchal abuse she faced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea90a26c77f89c021ce779066c2f96785571080d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea90a26c77f89c021ce779066c2f96785571080d/0_133_1888_1133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naz Shah, left, and her sister Fozia after their mother\u2019s appeal was rejected.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naz Shah, left, and her sister Fozia after their mother\u2019s appeal was rejected.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Curtis/PA Archive/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Shah, Yaqoob shipped in more toxicity to Bradford: Yaqoob campaigners from the West Midlands told voters they had come there to campaign because Shah was the daughter of a prostitute. At <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NazShahBfd/status/1186744130808041478?s=20\" title=\"\">one of Yaqoob\u2019s rallies</a>, she applauded a speaker who said in Urdu \u201cwhen we buy a dog we look at its pedigree\u2026 What do Naz Shah\u2019s characteristics or her appearance tell us?\u201d (Yaqoob later claimed she did not understand the dialect.)

      "bodyText": "I was on a train by myself on a warm summer day, wearing a knee-length skirt. An Asian male guard in his 50s was walking down the train. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t sit like that, I can see everything,\u201d he hissed at me. The implication was that I was some kind of hussy for sitting in a skirt, legs bare and uncrossed. It\u2019s far from my only run-in with rank misogyny, but I bawled when I got home. I knew the guard wouldn\u2019t have said that to me had I been white, that he felt he had the right to police me because of our shared skin colour. It made my sense of disgust at his behaviour more acute. I was reminded of this last week when I read Labour MP Naz Shah\u2019s powerful account of Salma Yaqoob\u2019s complicity in the toxic misogyny directed at her by a vocal minority of Muslim men in the 2017 Bradford West election. Yaqoob, the former leader of the Respect party, has just been shortlisted by Labour as a candidate for West Midlands mayor. \u201cHer campaign created a platform which allowed men to literally slut shame me,\u201d Shah says, leaving her feeling suicidal. It takes an understanding of the biraderi, or clan, politics that have historically dominated some south Asian communities to fully grasp why the actions of Yaqoob, who ran as an independent against Shah, were so insidious. From the 1960s onwards in places such as east London, Birmingham and Bradford, local Labour politicians developed mutually beneficial relationships with self-appointed \u201ccommunity leaders\u201d from Asian immigrant communities. Labour councils funded their organisations to provide services as a way of managing growing diversity and became increasingly dependent on community leaders for electoral support, relying on kinship bloc voting, in which older men ensured everyone in their extended network voted the same way. The effect has been to give huge power to those men while marginalising women and young people. A Newsnight investigation in 2016 interviewed a number of Muslim women who said their attempts to get involved in Labour politics were thwarted by men within their community. The sense of disenchantment this engendered among young Muslims was one factor behind George Galloway\u2019s victory for Respect in the Bradford West byelection of 2012. After that, Labour decided its next candidate would be from an all-women shortlist. But any woman fighting that seat was bound to face a hostile ride. The first to be selected withdrew just days afterwards. Enter Naz Shah, bravest of feminists. Her story is extraordinary. She was propelled into the role of domestic violence campaigner as a teenager after her mother was jailed for 15 years for killing the man who sexually enslaved her (the mother). A few years earlier, her mother had sent 12-year-old Shah to Pakistan to protect her from her abuser. Shah was forced to marry a much older cousin, whom she later divorced. A woman for these reasons considered \u201cdishonoured\u201d by a small number of toxic men in her community, Shah had a tough time fighting Galloway in 2015 and has spoken about the nasty attempts to smear her. But she found the 2017 campaign even worse after Yaqoob entered the race, even though Shah says Yaqoob had previously agreed to stay out of it after she spoke to her about the patriarchal abuse she faced. According to Shah, Yaqoob shipped in more toxicity to Bradford: Yaqoob campaigners from the West Midlands told voters they had come there to campaign because Shah was the daughter of a prostitute. At one of Yaqoob\u2019s rallies, she applauded a speaker who said in Urdu \u201cwhen we buy a dog we look at its pedigree\u2026 What do Naz Shah\u2019s characteristics or her appearance tell us?\u201d (Yaqoob later claimed she did not understand the dialect.) In another video, Yaqoob is seen saying to Shah: \u201cWhen you make a chapati you may need to flip flop, but if you can\u2019t stick to your position get out of the kitchen, love\u201d, to male hooting and cheering. My train incident pales in comparison, but it would have felt worse had there been another Asian woman of my generation cheering the conductor on. Yaqoob\u2019s complicity is devastating, not least because she has spoken out about biraderi politics on numerous occasions as \u201ca corrupting influence on politics\u201d. But the truth is that her former party, Respect, attracted votes by railing against clan politics even as it benefited from it: for instance, Galloway visited the Bangladeshi province of Sylhet to canvas for support when he ran in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005. In the context of rising Islamophobia, it can be immensely difficult for women to call this out for fear of stigmatising their own communities. And of course, misogyny exists everywhere in society: just look at the revolting revelations about the Presidents Club dinner. But \u201csexism everywhere\u201d cannot be used as a foil to hide behind when women like Shah have the courage to speak out about their treatment at the hands of men who share their skin colour and heritage but not their values. Not only was Yaqoob \u2013 who also stands accused of homophobic and antisemitic remarks \u2013 allowed to join Labour a few months ago despite being formally admonished by the party for putting out leaflets in 2017 saying a vote for her was a vote for Jeremy Corbyn, she was waved through to the mayoral shortlist. (Labour says it was because she was the only BAME candidate to put herself forward, a sorry indictment of its efforts to encourage people of colour to stand for office.) No one is beyond redemption, and that includes Yaqoob. Shah herself provides a model for that: after it came to light in 2016 that she had shared an antisemitic Facebook post before she became an MP, she issued an unreserved apology for the hurt she caused and has since been widely praised by the Jewish community for her efforts to make amends and educate others about antisemitism. All Yaqoob has issued are denials that her campaign was complicit in patriarchy and clan politics, a tweeted apology for standing against Shah and an appeal to move on. The minimum we should expect is a sincere apology and a temporary withdrawal from public life to honestly reflect on her actions. If a white man had run a campaign like Yaqoob\u2019s, he would not have escaped consequence as she has. That tells us that society is complicit in the double oppression of women of colour: caught between the intersectionality of gender and race, we are not only more likely to face sexism from people of all colours, but less likely to be heard when we call out misogyny from within our own communities. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist",

It would be very hard to vote for Biden. I would not have any regrets voting for Warren. I just hope she wouldn\u2019t turn out to be like Obama.

I trust Sanders,\u201d said Thurston. Pat Copley, a 72-year-old former hospital ward clerk who is unflinching in her support for Sanders, said she was drawn to him by his healthcare reforms. But she is uncertain about how the issue plays in small-town Iowa. On the one hand, private insurance premiums have surged while small hospitals have been closing across the midwest. On the other, she is frustrated that those with good and affordable insurance, particularly labour union members, are fearful of a government-run programme paid for through taxation. \u201cI know retired union people who are fearful and I don\u2019t know what he can say to change their minds,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fears about healthcare. They\u2019re false.\u201d \u2018Still shopping around\u2019 Sanders still has several advantages. Endorsements by two members of \u201cthe Squad\u201d, representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, shored up his bona fides as the original radical in the race. He also has the largest election chest filled from small donations by individual supporters and an activist base far more organised and energised than many of his rivals. Sanders has sought to diminish concerns about his health by casting his age as experience. Still, Copley worries that his heart attack has potential supporters looking elsewhere. \u201cI hear that talk in Iowa,\u201d she said. \u201cMy 78-year-old friend doesn\u2019t want to vote for him because he\u2019s too old. I\u2019m going to continue to vote for him because he speaks to me. It may be pie in the sky but I\u2019m going to follow him,.\u201d For Alex Abbe, a 32-year-old high school teacher, it is a major issue. \u201cI\u2019m still shopping around. Honestly, the age and the heart attack concerns me. I don\u2019t plan on caucusing for Bernie,\u201d he said, even though he turned out to see Sanders speak. \u201cI\u2019m attracted to someone who brings energy. I don\u2019t get that with Biden. Elizabeth Warren I do. I\u2019m one of those voters who like the more progressive plans of some of the candidates. But then on the flip side, you\u2019ve got to ask yourself, are those achievable things? I don\u2019t know what route I\u2019m going to go down.\u201d The downturn in Sanders\u2019 political fortunes has some of his most ardent supporters pondering what to do if he doesn\u2019t win the nomination. Some refused to vote for Clinton last time. Copley did, reluctantly. \u201cI felt like I had a gun to my head. I don\u2019t know if I can do it again, vote for any old liberal. It would be very hard to vote for Biden. I would not have any regrets voting for Warren. I just hope she wouldn\u2019t turn out to be like Obama. I thought he was going to be a lot more progressive than he turned out being. He did a lot of things I thought were horrid. But Sanders I trust.\u201d The Thurstons are also conflicted. Both refused to vote for Clinton in 2016. Kelly wrote in Sanders on the ballot paper. Thomas voted for the Green candidate, Jill Stein. This time Kelly said removing Donald Trump is the priority. Thomas said he \u201cprobably\u201d will vote for the Democrat. \u201cDepends on which one,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all more progressive now because of Bernie. The options have gotten better. Whether they\u2019re really being true to their word or not we\u2019ll find out.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In the conventional view of American politics, Joe Biden is a moderate while Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are on the left and Donald Trump is on the right. This conventional view is rubbish. Today\u2019s great divide is not between left and right. It\u2019s between democracy and oligarchy. There are no longer \u201cmoderates\u201d. There\u2019s no longer a \u201ccenter\u201d. The most powerful force in American politics today is anti-establishment fury at a rigged system. Four decades ago, when America had a large and growing middle class, the left wanted stronger social safety nets and more public investment in schools, roads and research. The right sought greater reliance on the free market. In those days, a general election was like a competition between two hotdog vendors on a long boardwalk extending from left to right. To maximize sales, each had to move to the middle. If one strayed too far left or right, the other would move beside him and take all sales from the rest of the boardwalk. This older American politics is now obsolete. As wealth and power have moved to the top and the middle class has shrunk, more Americans have joined the ranks of the working class and poor. Most Americans \u2013 regardless of whether they were once on the left or right \u2013 have become politically disempowered and economically insecure. Nowadays it\u2019s the boardwalk versus private jets on their way to the Hamptons. As Rahm Emmanuel, Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff and former mayor of Chicago, told the New York Times: \u201cThis is really the crack-up. Usually fights are Democrats versus Republicans, one end of Pennsylvania versus the other, or the left versus the right. Today\u2019s squabbles are internal between the establishment versus the people that are storming the barricades.\u201d In 2016, Trump harnessed many of these frustrations, as did Sanders. The frustrations today are larger than they were in 2016. Corporate profits are higher, as is CEO pay. Markets are more monopolized. Wealth is more concentrated at the top. Although the official unemployment rate is lower, most peoples\u2019 incomes have gone nowhere and they have even less job security. Meanwhile, Washington has become even swampier. Big corporations, Wall Street and billionaires have flooded it with money and lobbyists. Trump has given out all the tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and subsidies they have ever wanted. The oligarchy is in charge. Why hasn\u2019t America risen up in protest? Because American democracy was dysfunctional even before Trump ran for president. The moneyed interests had already taken over much of it. It\u2019s hard for people to get very excited about returning to the widening inequalities and growing corruption of the decades before Trump. Which partly explains why Biden is foundering. At the same time, Trump and his propagandists at Fox News have channeled working-class rage against the establishment into fears of imaginary threats such as immigrants, socialists and a \u201cdeep state\u201d. But a large majority of Americans \u2013 right and left, Republican as well as Democrat \u2013 could get excited about moving toward a real democracy and economy that worked for the many. This is why the oligarchy is so worried about Warren\u2019s rise to frontrunner status in some polls. Politico reports that Democratic-leaning executives on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley and across the corporate world are watching her with an increasing panic. \u201cNinety-seven per cent of the people I know in my world are really, really fearful of her,\u201d billionaire Michael Novogratz told Bloomberg. These Democratic oligarchs hope Biden, or perhaps Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar, can still take Warren out. In just the third quarter, Buttigieg raised about $25,000 from executives at Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and hedge fund giants like Bridgewater, Renaissance Technologies and Elliott Management. And another $150,000 from donors who described their occupation as \u201cinvestor\u201d. If Biden implodes and neither Buttigieg nor Klobuchar takes the lead from Warren, Wall Street and corporate Democrats hope former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg will ride into the primary at the last minute. It won\u2019t work. The stark reality is that Democrats cannot defeat Trump\u2019s authoritarian populism with an establishment candidate who fronts for the oligarchy. The only way Democrats win is with an agenda of fundamental democratic and economic reform, such as provided by Warren and also by Sanders. Unless Democrats stand squarely on the side of democracy against oligarchy, the risk on election day is that too many Americans will either stand with Trump or stay home.

It was the only land defeat suffered by the Soviet army in the 20th century. In both cases, Poland twice saved Europe from unwelcome invaders. BK Polachowski Greasby, Wirral",

In several polls they signalled their willingness to sacrifice Scotland as a price worth paying for securing Brexit. This seems to have lodged itself subliminally in the minds of Tory MPs at Westminster. In recent weeks they have been seen to observe a rather less edifying ritual of their own. Thus, whenever Ian Blackford rises to respond to the latest convulsion on the withdrawal agreement a signal is emitted at a pitch that can only be picked up by English Tories. As soon as the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader opens his mouth to speak, they rise as one and depart the chamber. At other times they talk loudly over him in an adolescent attempt to convey indifference and disdain.</p> <p>Seasoned Scottish MPs who are accustomed to the rough exchanges of this place have been astonished at this behaviour. Social alliances between the two parties, born of bar-room conviviality and membership of the same special interest clubs, have been a feature of the past few Westminster terms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A chill has been manifest in the loutish behaviour of many Tory MPs and their disrespect of Blackford in the chamber</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One SNP MP, part of the 56 who took all but three of Scotland\u2019s seats in 2015, told me of how genial he had always found the Tories to be. \u201cThey are far more civilised and less hostile and tribal than the Labour contingent,\u201d he told me a year later. \u201cThey rarely allowed political beliefs to get in the way of human engagement, whereas Labour politicians, with whom we have much more in common doctrinally, are often sullen and guarded.\u201d</p> <p>Part of this of course had its roots in something more prosaic. Recognising the strength in numbers of the SNP intake, Conservative MPs were eager to solicit support from among the new group when a prized committee chairmanship was up for grabs. The horse-trading was often conducted in Westminster\u2019s social gathering places and alliances born of mutual respect, if not friendship, were born.</p> <p>A chill became apparent, though, with Johnson\u2019s accession and has been manifest in the loutish behaviour of many Tory MPs and their studied disrespect of Blackford in the chamber. \u201cSome of it has been truly embarrassing,\u201d another Scottish MP told me last week. \u201cAnd you can see it in the eyes of some of the older and more experienced Tories, like Kenneth Clark, who seem aghast at this.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson himself chose to deepen this sense of a party that is now past caring about the prospect of an independent Scotland. Last week he admitted that he was in no mind to grant the Scottish parliament any role in approving the withdrawal agreement. Yet the bill will carry legislation into 17 devolved areas with the Scottish government claiming that it will actually impact on a further 44. His intentions run contrary to the <a href=\"https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20170701045316/www.gov.scot/About/Government/Sewel/KeyFacts\" title=\"\">Sewel convention</a> of Westminster not normally involving itself in devolved areas without the consent of Holyrood. It also undermined Johnson\u2019s decision to award himself the imaginary cabinet portfolio of minister for the union in the style of Idi Amin declaring himself to be the king of Scotland.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The departure for good of all Scottish MPs would make it almost impossible for Labour to entertain any prospect of power</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Respecting the Sewel convention would never have been near the top of Johnson\u2019s political concerns, so why make a show of belittling Holyrood like this? In public he maintains the unionist line on Scottish independence by refusing to countenance any talk of a second referendum. Other Tories believe, though, that he would find it difficult to refuse a second independence referendum if there were to be another clear pro-independence majority at the next Scottish election in 2021. And certainly not if the electoral campaign were a manifesto for independence. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ruth-davidson\" title=\"\">Ruth Davidson</a>, who recently resigned as Scottish leader, was the Tories\u2019 most potent weapon against independence, but she\u2019s no longer around to bend his ear on the issue.</p> <p>As ever with Johnson, there are pragmatic reasons for finally letting Scotland go, which resonate with an almost frightening level of personal ambition. The departure for good of all Scottish MPs would make it almost impossible for Labour to entertain any prospect of power in the foreseeable future. This would leave him virtually unopposed as prime minister of England for a generation.</p> <p>Those polls indicating that a majority of English Brexiters would be happy to lose Scotland in the process merely reflected the rhetoric of Jacob Rees-Mogg and the European Research Group. Over the past three years their loudest cheers have come when they channel Trafalgar, Waterloo and cry God for Harry, England and St George. When they talk about taking back control and being free once more to make their own laws everyone knows these are English laws and English control. If only losing Northern Ireland were just as simple.</p> <p>Once, a Tory prime minister would have been horrified at the prospect of going down in history as the one who lost Scotland. But at this time in this England Johnson would quickly be forgiven if he were also the man who delivered its independence.</p> <p>\u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist</p>",

One SNP MP, part of the 56 who took all but three of Scotland\u2019s seats in 2015, told me of how genial he had always found the Tories to be. \u201cThey are far more civilised and less hostile and tribal than the Labour contingent,\u201d he told me a year later. \u201cThey rarely allowed political beliefs to get in the way of human engagement, whereas Labour politicians, with whom we have much more in common doctrinally, are often sullen and guarded.\u201d Part of this of course had its roots in something more prosaic. Recognising the strength in numbers of the SNP intake, Conservative MPs were eager to solicit support from among the new group when a prized committee chairmanship was up for grabs. The horse-trading was often conducted in Westminster\u2019s social gathering places and alliances born of mutual respect, if not friendship, were born. A chill became apparent, though, with Johnson\u2019s accession and has been manifest in the loutish behaviour of many Tory MPs and their studied disrespect of Blackford in the chamber. \u201cSome of it has been truly embarrassing,\u201d another Scottish MP told me last week. \u201cAnd you can see it in the eyes of some of the older and more experienced Tories, like Kenneth Clark, who seem aghast at this.\u201d Johnson himself chose to deepen this sense of a party that is now past caring about the prospect of an independent Scotland. Last week he admitted that he was in no mind to grant the Scottish parliament any role in approving the withdrawal agreement. Yet the bill will carry legislation into 17 devolved areas with the Scottish government claiming that it will actually impact on a further 44. His intentions run contrary to the Sewel convention of Westminster not normally involving itself in devolved areas without the consent of Holyrood. It also undermined Johnson\u2019s decision to award himself the imaginary cabinet portfolio of minister for the union in the style of Idi Amin declaring himself to be the king of Scotland. Respecting the Sewel convention would never have been near the top of Johnson\u2019s political concerns, so why make a show of belittling Holyrood like this? In public he maintains the unionist line on Scottish independence by refusing to countenance any talk of a second referendum. Other Tories believe, though, that he would find it difficult to refuse a second independence referendum if there were to be another clear pro-independence majority at the next Scottish election in 2021. And certainly not if the electoral campaign were a manifesto for independence. Ruth Davidson, who recently resigned as Scottish leader, was the Tories\u2019 most potent weapon against independence, but she\u2019s no longer around to bend his ear on the issue. As ever with Johnson, there are pragmatic reasons for finally letting Scotland go, which resonate with an almost frightening level of personal ambition. The departure for good of all Scottish MPs would make it almost impossible for Labour to entertain any prospect of power in the foreseeable future. This would leave him virtually unopposed as prime minister of England for a generation. Those polls indicating that a majority of English Brexiters would be happy to lose Scotland in the process merely reflected the rhetoric of Jacob Rees-Mogg and the European Research Group. Over the past three years their loudest cheers have come when they channel Trafalgar, Waterloo and cry God for Harry, England and St George. When they talk about taking back control and being free once more to make their own laws everyone knows these are English laws and English control. If only losing Northern Ireland were just as simple. Once, a Tory prime minister would have been horrified at the prospect of going down in history as the one who lost Scotland. But at this time in this England Johnson would quickly be forgiven if he were also the man who delivered its independence. \u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>When Mabel (Jess Weixler) asks her fellow actor Rosenthal (a magnetic, brilliantly self-aware Adam Pearson) if he has representation, she means to find out whether he has an agent.

Just when you thought the kids, wandering naughtily with aerosols after breaking into the newly built factory, had escaped with scares and bruises from a gas explosion, the entire concrete roof dissolved with them inside, suddenly trapped, dying, already dead. Just as you were beginning to have trickled doubts about nice councillor Iwan Bevan and the cost-cutting behind the grandiose project designed to rejuvenate his Welsh valley, he suddenly squeezed the face of wife Polly, Sarah Lancashire, hissing dreadful hate.</p> <p>Shock stalks the streets of our fictional valley to growing effect, and it will soon be added to by horrible mob-blame, press-fuelled of course. Writer Jack Thorne, who has adapted Philip Pullman for an imminent TV outing, was responsible for <em>National Treasure</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/14/week-in-tv-kiri-next-of-kin-spiral-sarah-lancashire-review\" title=\"\">Kiri</a></em>, but I think this third part of his loose shame/blame contemporary trilogy is the absolute standout: bitter, truthful, already captivating.</p> <p>The acting helps. Joanna Scanlan, Sidse Babett <em>Borgen</em> Knudsen \u2013 but chiefly Lancashire. How readily we take her subtlety for granted; in this, she masters all the dichotomies of a battered wife who, despite all, dearly loves her husband, with a raw and a spirited intelligence. The authenticity blisters.

Scenes of a sexual nature. Distressing scenes. That about covers it, you snowflakes \u2013 oh, and flashing images.\u201d They didn\u2019t say a little bit of that, in honesty, but what they left out was \u201cscenes designed to leave you hideously discombobulated, plot-wise\u201d. The programme was <strong><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/watchmen\" title=\"\">Watchmen</a></strong>, and co-author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/18/goodbye-alan-moore-the-king-of-comics-bows-out\" title=\"\">Alan Moore</a> famously called his own graphic novel, one of <em>Time</em> magazine\u2019s 100 best books of the past century, \u201cunfilmable\u201d. Adapter Damon Lindelof (<em>Lost</em>) has made out of these problems an utter triumph.</p> <p>The original, 80s-set, dealt mainly with cold war threat; by setting it here and now, with timely flashbacks, Lindelof shifts focus to the racism of the new right. It\u2019s a sprawling megalith of imagination, but kept in check just enough to draw you into a finely trammelled plot: one of broken, outlawed superheroes, masked police/vigilantes and alternative timelines.</p> <p>It\u2019s the visionary production details that work so, so well. A half-glimpsed telly set displaying Mount Rushmore with \u2013 blink and you\u2019d miss it \u2013 Nixon\u2019s profile. Old adverts, newsreels, bars, utterly invented brands \u2013 all roll into a delicious dark alternative feast.

      "bodyText": "The Accident (Channel 4) | All 4 Watchmen (Sky Atlantic) | sky.com The British Tribe Next Door (Channel 4) | All 4 Warrior Women With Lupita Nyong\u2019o (Channel 4) | All 4 Motherland (BBC Two) | iPlayer Sudden shock built seamlessly on sudden shock in The Accident. Just when you thought the kids, wandering naughtily with aerosols after breaking into the newly built factory, had escaped with scares and bruises from a gas explosion, the entire concrete roof dissolved with them inside, suddenly trapped, dying, already dead. Just as you were beginning to have trickled doubts about nice councillor Iwan Bevan and the cost-cutting behind the grandiose project designed to rejuvenate his Welsh valley, he suddenly squeezed the face of wife Polly, Sarah Lancashire, hissing dreadful hate. Shock stalks the streets of our fictional valley to growing effect, and it will soon be added to by horrible mob-blame, press-fuelled of course. Writer Jack Thorne, who has adapted Philip Pullman for an imminent TV outing, was responsible for National Treasure and Kiri, but I think this third part of his loose shame/blame contemporary trilogy is the absolute standout: bitter, truthful, already captivating. The acting helps. Joanna Scanlan, Sidse Babett Borgen Knudsen \u2013 but chiefly Lancashire. How readily we take her subtlety for granted; in this, she masters all the dichotomies of a battered wife who, despite all, dearly loves her husband, with a raw and a spirited intelligence. The authenticity blisters. A really-must-watch. \u2018The following programme,\u201d we were warned, \u201ccontains strong language, violent scenes. Scenes of a sexual nature. Distressing scenes. That about covers it, you snowflakes \u2013 oh, and flashing images.\u201d They didn\u2019t say a little bit of that, in honesty, but what they left out was \u201cscenes designed to leave you hideously discombobulated, plot-wise\u201d. The programme was Watchmen, and co-author Alan Moore famously called his own graphic novel, one of Time magazine\u2019s 100 best books of the past century, \u201cunfilmable\u201d. Adapter Damon Lindelof (Lost) has made out of these problems an utter triumph. The original, 80s-set, dealt mainly with cold war threat; by setting it here and now, with timely flashbacks, Lindelof shifts focus to the racism of the new right. It\u2019s a sprawling megalith of imagination, but kept in check just enough to draw you into a finely trammelled plot: one of broken, outlawed superheroes, masked police/vigilantes and alternative timelines. It\u2019s the visionary production details that work so, so well. A half-glimpsed telly set displaying Mount Rushmore with \u2013 blink and you\u2019d miss it \u2013 Nixon\u2019s profile. Old adverts, newsreels, bars, utterly invented brands \u2013 all roll into a delicious dark alternative feast. An ex-handsome, still-brave, bona fide 1980s icon was lynched, appallingly, to the strains of Pore Jud Is Daid. An all-black version of Oklahoma. And Jeremy Irons, naked in an English mansion, writing plays about watchmakers and timeshifts. If your appetite\u2019s not whetted, it\u2019s unwhettable.

For those who haven\u2019t heard the premise \u2013 it still staggers, quietly, that this made it past the commissioning stage, rather than being taken behind the barn and hit with an axe \u2013 the wheeze was to take a demi-celebrity and her family, Scarlett Moffatt from Geordieland off of Gogglebox, and move them \u2013 and, crucially, recreate their two-up two-down Bishop Auckland bloody semi, replete with their 20,000 possessions \u2013 to Otjeme in Namibia. It was saved, almost, by making the Moffatt family the butt of most jokes (doesn\u2019t make it any less exploitative: we were still there to scoff in wonder, but it was at expense of class, not race). In the end, the generally lovely Himba people (the older men were rather less woke than, say, Geoffrey Boycott) seemed remarkably unperturbed at the marvels of County Durham landing in their backyard.

      "bodyText": "Although her name suggests a gem unearthed by the crate-digger label Awesome Tapes from Africa, Sudan Archives is an artist of now. Based in Los Angeles, the 24-year-old producer combines genre-defying sound with non-standard violin-playing and an Afro-futurist sensibility. Two previous EPs chart her journey from bedroom experiments with a loop station to fully realised, roots-inflected R&amp;B tunes. So while Sudan Archives bears comparison to other queenly outliers like Solange or FKA Twigs, her sound has remained resolutely individual, informed by the electronic experiments of Cameroonian Francis Bebey. On this debut album, Sudan\u2019s sphere expands further. From the opening pizzicato plunk of Did You Know to the sultry distortions of Pelicans in the Summer, the variety of modes on offer has pixelated. Tracks like Confessions find western classical strings scything across a song about personal exile, while party grooves like Glorious boast a swirling north African motif on the fiddle. The album title takes its inspiration from Black Athena, a controversial scholastic work on the Egyptian influence on ancient Greece, though the songs often lean more towards the arty end of the mainstream, losing touch slightly with the startling radicalism of Sudan Archives\u2019 early sound.",

He ended up striking out on a foul bunt. The Nationals would never score again. It\u2019s hard not to second guess the strategy especially since Sanchez would go on to immediately allow another run. It was, however, less of a straight up blunder than a perhaps necessary gamble. As Michael Baumann points out <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2019/10/26/20933218/world-series-game-3-washington-nationals-houston-astros\">in an article for the Ringer</a>, it\u2019s a direct consequence of the manager not having trust in his objectively bad bullpen.

Corbin himself has been working out of the bullpen during this postseason, he made an appearance back in Game 1, and there\u2019s a very real possibility that he won\u2019t be able to give his team more than a handful of effective innings. If Corbin can\u2019t go long, well, the Nationals bullpen remains their Achilles heel.<br></p> <p>All this means is that the Astros have a very good chance at evening out the World Series tonight, with Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander ready to go. If they lose? Well, being down 3-1, with another game left on the road, is not an ideal situation for any team, regardless of how good they have been all season long.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the complete report for Game 4 of the World Seires: Email from Allan Barrett: Great coverage. I\u2019m monitoring from Batam, Indonesia. Astros feasting on baby sharks in DC. Go Astros. At the very least, the Astros have guaranteed that the series will going back to Houston. Meanwhile, the Nationals have to know they\u2019ve missed a golden opportunity. Everything now hinges on Game 5 where the Astros will have Gerrit Cole and the Nationals with have Max Scherzer. I would say that the Nationals have the edge because they will be playing at home but\u2026 well, it\u2019s difficult to say that\u2019s the case in this series. Honestly, given the fact that Urquidy ended up being Houston\u2019s most efficient starter here, it\u2019s hard to predict anything other than Game 5 should be incredible. In other words, please join the Guardian tomorrow as we will liveblog this pivotal game (but then again, aren\u2019t they all). That will do it for our Game 4 liveblog, however, thanks to everybody who has been following along with us, especially those who contributed! So much for home field advantage. After losing the first two games of the series at home, the Houston Astros have come to Nationals Park and evened the series. Plus, they ensure that this World Series will at least go six games. Astros 8-1 Nationals, FINAL Trea Turner does by grounding out to short. The Houston Astros win! Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 9th Brian Dozier is in the game to hit and all he has to be thinking is \u201cplease let me not be the last out in a World Series game.\u201d He takes a strike. 0-1. The next pitch is outside. 1-1. Another pitch out the zone, this one too low. 2-1. Dozier souls the next one off. 2-2. Nationals are down to their final strike. He takes the next pitch for a ball, it\u2019s way too tall. 3-2. That one\u2019s a little lower, but still high. Dozier takes a walk. He will, in fact, not make the final out. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 9th Yan Gomes gets into a 0-2 hole quickly, but he takes three balls off the plate to get ahead of the count before striking out swinging. The Astros just need one more out to secure a win. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 9th Chris Devenski, I know that I haven\u2019t typed that name before, is here to take care of the bottom of the 9th. Robles is up for Washington and he is out for Washington as he lines out to left. The Astros are two outs away. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 9th Yordan Alvarez gets a chance to pinch-hit and he just fouls-out to end the top of the ninth. The Astros are three outs away from evening the World Series 2-2. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 9th Jake Marisnick hits a single and Chirinos tries to go home on it but he\u2019s thrown out at home! The remaining Nationals fans give that play a cheer. You take the pleasure when you can get them. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 9th Next up is Chirinos, who takes two balls and then checks his swing on ball three. The trainers take a look at him, but it seems he\u2019s fine. He, at least, stays in and watches a strike at the lower half of the plate. 3-1. On the next pitch he hits a double. Not a bad game for the Houston catcher, I think it\u2019s safe to say. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 9th Guerra is here for the Nationals, presumably to finish out the game unless he absolutely cannot get anybody out. Correa pops out to Zimmerman for the first out of the inning. Email from Graham Tidswell: Following your excellent score line Adelaide, SouthAustralia ...with thanks..GoGo ASTROS These are the most fun games for a fan: you\u2019re not only winning a World Series game but there\u2019s close to zero stress thanks to the score. Astros 8-1 Nationals, bottom 8th Ryan Zimmerman takes two balls and then pops out to Springer in right. We\u2019re at the ninth inning! Astros 8-1 Nationals, bottom 8th Howie Kendrick strikes out swinging. The Nationals now have four outs to get seven runs. Assuming they can pitch a scoreless ninth. No biggie, right? Astros 8-1 Nationals, bottom 8th Juan Soto, who has struggled since turning 21 yesterday, is at the plate here. Soto works a full count and then keeps fouling balls off to stay alive and he takes a walk on a very high pitch. That\u2019s two on and one out now for the Nationals. Astros 8-1 Nationals, bottom 8th Peacock is out for the eighth. Eaton is up at the plate and he grounds out quickly. People ask me all the time (note: this is not true, people don\u2019t ask me anything) about whether or not I have rooting interest while liveblogging. In the interest of media transparency, I will say that I\u2019m mostly rooting for drama but I will be honest with you: In lopsided games I am 100% rooting for quick outs. Rendon does not do that, he outruns a ground ball and makes it to first. It\u2019s scored an error on Altuve. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 8th Instead Gurriel lines out to, who else, Robles. To the bottom of the 8th! Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 8th Bregman hits a ball to the outfield and all Soto can do is trap it. It\u2019s two on with two out and the Astros have another decent shot at scoring some runs. Those RISP issues feel like forever ago for Houston. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 8th And now Brantley is up and he hits one but it\u2019s to Robles, whose defensive play continues to be one of the few positives that Nationals fans can take away from this game. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 8th Altuve hits a one-out single into centerfield. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 8th Javy Guerra will pitch the top of the 8th for the Nationals where he faces Springer, who strikes out for his fourth out of the game. Astros 8-1 Nationals, bottom 7th Brad Peacock is facing Trea Turner who grounds one sharply to first where Gurriel is just barely able to make the play at the plate to get the final out of the inning. The Astros snuff out a potential Nationals rally and they are six outs away from evening the World Series. Roger Kirkby: Nationals score 17 runs in the first 2 games, have 2 so far in the next 2. Don\u2019t put all the blame on the mound dogs. They should have saved some for later, as the old saying goes. Astros 8-1 Nationals, bottom 7th Asdrubal Cabrera is up to hit with one on and two out and he manages to work a walk off of Rendon who is showing why he is pitching in an 8-1 situation. Even the two outs he got were rather loud ones. And A.J. Hinch wants to end this right here. He wants Brad Peacock to ensure that Washington can\u2019t even sniff a comeback. Astros 8-1 Nationals, bottom 7th Credit Gomes for continuing to battle here despite his team\u2019s odds, he works a 2-2 count and then just keeps fouling pitches off before lining out to Brantley for the second out. And keep in mind one of those strikes went into the stands for a grand slam. Astros 8-1 Nationals, bottom 7th Robles hits a single off of Rondon. 7-run inning coming? Astros 8-1 Nationals, bottom 7th Wander Suero was pitching for the Nationals at the end of the inning, I guess my mind was him-ing. Hector Rondon is pitching for the Astros and he gets Zimmerman to line out to Springer. Okay now it\u2019s safe to say the Astros are going to even the World Series out 2-2. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 7th \u201cThe Moody\u2019s Christmas: a three night event.\u201d Wait, this is horrid looking Denis Leary comedy is a freaking mini-series and not like a made-for-TV movie, like it\u2019s \u201cChernobyl\u201d or something? How? Sorry, sorry, there\u2019s still a game going on. Tucker is back up and he strikes out. We will not see two grand slams in the same inning today. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 7th Marisnick takes a walk. The bases are re-loaded and Rodney\u2019s night is over. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 7th Chirinos is up now, with two on and still just one out. Rodney throws two straight balls before getting him to ground out to third, a play that Rendon just barely completes. Finally there\u2019s that second out. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 7th Well congrats to Martinez for saving his high-leverage relievers. Hopefully for him, there will be situations to use them at some point in the next few games. Rodney walks Correa\u2026 and this game was going at such a quick pace before this. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 7th I guess I should say something to make sure everybody still keeps reading this liveblog. There is no clock in baseball? Theoretically, the Nationals could still win this one. It would take one of the most shocking single game comebacks in MLB history, but it\u2019s possible. Rodney is not helping to make this scenario likely, he walks Gurriel. Astros 8-1 Nationals, top 7th And Bregman golfs a low pitch from Rodney into the stands for a grand slam and this one is over! Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 7th I can\u2019t overstate how great Brantley has been this series and he\u2019s had some numbers against Rodney. Rodney\u2019s first pitch is a ball. 1-0. Brantley fouls off the next pitch. 1-1. Brantley hits a solid single off of Rodney but somehow the Astros don\u2019t score. The bases are loaded with just one out and here comes Bregman. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 7th And we have a mound visit. I\u2019m guessing \u201cmaybe a strike would be good here\u201d is at least part of the conversation. One doesn\u2019t come on Rainey\u2019s first pitch to Altuve. 1-0. Altuve pops up on the next pitch and the runners have to hold. Rainey really needed that one. Not that it will extend his night as Martinez wants Fernando Rodney here. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 7th And Rainey falls behind Springer 3-1. Springer helps him out by fouling the next one off. 3-2. And there\u2019s Ball Four. That walk felt inevitable. It\u2019s two on and still nobody out. This could get ugly. Astros 4-1 Nationals, top 7th Tanner Rainey is now pitching for the Nationals and he\u2019s facing Kyle Tucker, who is pinch-hitting for Houston. He falls behind 3-0 almost immediately. He gets a strike call on the next pitch but his fifth is another ball so Tucker takes his base. This is why Martinez was so hesitant to call upon his relievers. It really feels like that inning was the game. The Nationals desperately needed to take advantage of that bases loaded, one out situation better than that. Now they\u2019re still down three runs late and have to hope that they don\u2019t fall behind any further and get another chance to rally. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 6th It\u2019s all down to Howie Kendrick here to see if he can really get the Nationals back in this thing. He gets ahead in the count 2-1 before taking a healthy cut and missing. 2-2. Huge, huge moment in this game right here. AND HARRIS STRIKES HIM OUT! We\u2019re heading to the seventh. Astros 4-1 Nationals, bottom 6th Soto hits a groundball to score Parra and move up the runners. The Astros will gladly exchange a run for the second out of the inning. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 6th Will Harris pitches to Rendon who hoofs out an infield single to load the bases and things have gotten very, very interesting here. Just as we all predicted. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 6th And we have a mound visit before James faces Eaton. Eaton takes a ball and then a strike before taking his first swing on James, just to foul off a changeup. 1-2. James\u2019s next pitch swerves out of the zone and Eaton doesn\u2019t fish. 2-2. He also doesn\u2019t swing at the next pitch outside. 3-2. And the next pitch? That\u2019s in right around the same spot. That\u2019s two walks in the inning for James and that will do it for him. Now, we\u2019re officially in the Bullpen part of the Game. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 6th James gets Turner to strike out with the bat on his shoulders for the first out of the inning. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 6th Josh James comes in for Urquidy who did his job and then some today. He will be facing the pitcher\u2019s spot. It\u2019s \u201cBaby Shark\u201d time in the Nationals as Gerardo Parra steps in to his unique walk-up song in place of Corbin. He takes three straight pitches out of the zone and then a strike right on the corner. Good pitch from James. His next pitch is too low and that\u2019s a leadoff walk for the Nationals. That\u2019s ball four doo do do do do do Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 6th Marisnick is up with nobody on and two outs. This might be Corbin\u2019s last batter and he gets ahead of him quickly, putting him in a 1-2 count. The Nationals crowd gets up to encourage a strikeout, but Corbin wastes the next pitch by throwing it outside. Marisnick swings and fouls off the next pitch. Still 2-2 but he foul-tips the next one for a strikeout. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 6th Chirinos, who hit a two-run home run the last time he was up, will be facing Corbin again. At least this time around the worst he could do is a solo homer. Corbin\u2019s first two pitches to him are away but he throws one right down the heart of the plate to show that he isn\u2019t pitching scared. On 2-1, Chirinos makes solid contact but Robles manages to track it down for the out. He\u2019s had a great game in the outfield. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 6th Patrick Corbin is back out for the 6th. He\u2019s given them innings, but they haven\u2019t been the cleanest of innings. He\u2019s there to face Correa, who works a full count an then starts fouling off pitches to stay alive before lining out to second. And here\u2019s MLB\u2019s \u201cStand Up To Cancer\u201d moment, where people silently stand and display cards with the names of those they know who have been affected by cancer. It\u2019s a genuinely moving tradition and it chokes me up every time. Roger Kirkby: The song the Nats DJ needs to put on is \u201cHit me with your rhythm stick\u201d by Ian Dury and the blockheads. They need the runs like a constipated baboon. Now there\u2019s some baseball imagery for you. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 5th Gomes flies out and Urquidy is through five. So much for The Bullpen Game. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 5th Robles is up and takes three straight balls. After an automatic strike, a pitch right down the middle, Robles swings at the 3-1 pitch. That\u2019s right at Springer for the second out. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 5th It\u2019s a 4-0 deficit, but it has to feel much greater for the Nationals who haven\u2019t been able to do a single thing offensively today. Urquidy is still out there to start the fifth, this time around facing Ryan Zimmerman. He ahead 0-2 but his next two pitches are outside. 2-2. His next pitch is way up and out of the zone and almost hits Zimmerman. 3-2. Zimmerman fouls the next one off. Still 3-2. Urquidy gets him to swing and miss for his fourth strikeout of the night on the next pitch. And is that The The\u2019s \u201cThis Is The Day\u201d playing as we come back from the commercial break. Huge props to whoever has been selecting the music cues throughout this series. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 5th Gurriel, who seems to always be up in this series, is here and he takes two straight balls to start his latest at-bat. He takes a pitch for a strike, then another ball, before fouling the next pitch off right behind him. Full count. The crowd stands, sensing a possible inning-ending strikeout. Which they get! We\u2019re halfway through regulation here! Definitely a quicker pace than yesterday\u2019s game so far. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 5th Corbin\u2019s first two pitches to Bregman are both balls but he gets him the ground to Turner at short. This is some quick work from Corbin, with a lot of help from his fielders. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 5th Corbin is still in the game because Martinez really doesn\u2019t trust his bullpen. That may end up being the story of the World Series. His first pitch to Brantley is a ball and his second really should be at least a base hit but Robles robs him in the outfield. A defensive clinic, this game. Baseball: where the would-be Opener ends up becoming the most reliable starting pitcher of the series. Now he will be Ur-biquitous. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 4th Age after youth. If Soto couldn\u2019t do anything, it\u2019s now in Kendrick\u2019s hands. He takes two straight balls to start his at-bat and then gets great contact on a 2-0 offering but it\u2019s just a long flyball. That\u2019s the end of the fourth. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 4th Juan Soto is up next and he takes a ball off the upper corner. 1-0. Soto fouls the next one off. 1-1. The next pitch is too high. 2-1. Soto\u2019s next swing just gets a piece of the pitch. 2-2. He then takes a changeup that is quite outside. Full count. The crowd rises, hoping to get something/anything out of their young star. But Soto strikes out. Astros 4-0 Nationals, bottom 4th Urquidy is back out there and if he can give his team four scoreless innings than he will put his team in a perfect position to steal a win on a day where they were supposed to be the ones on the wrong end of a pitching mismatch. His first two pitches to Rendon are out of the zone. 2-0. Rendon fouls the next pitch off and then almost hits a double right out of Springer\u2019s range but it\u2019s foul. It\u2019s 2-2. On the next pitch, Rendon gets a good swing but it\u2019s for naught as it\u2019s right to Brantley in the outfield. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 4th Of course now the Nationals have to get Altuve out. He tries to rattled Altuve with a bunt but it\u2019s not successful and he gets throw out at first. But the damage is done. The Nationals are now in a serious hole heading into the bottom of the 4th. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 4th Springer takes a ball and then grounds out. Marisnick gets to third on the play but there\u2019s now two outs. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 4th Marisnick almost gets picked off at first before Corbin focuses on Springer. His first pitch is a strike and\u2014on that\u2014Marisnick takes second. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 4th Urquidy bunts one foul and strikes out, the smug American League fan commented. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 4th Marisnick hits a single to keep the line moving. Urquidy stays in the game to hit for himself, one has to assume he will be attempting a bunt. Astros 4-0 Nationals, top 4th Chirinos is up and he takes a ball and on the next pitch\u2026 OH MY STARS. He takes a mighty swing and the Astros have a four run lead! Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 4th Corbin falls behind Correa 3-0 but Corbin gets him to hack on the next two pitches. Full count. On 3-2\u2026 Corbin\u2019s pitch is just off the corner for a ball. Correa takes his base. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 3rd Adam Eaton is here trying to salvage something in the inning for the Nationals. Instead, he takes a strike and then hits a spinning pop up that he can\u2019t get to fall. Can\u2019t ask for a better start if you\u2019re an Astros fan. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 3rd So, Gomes is at second with one out rather than at third with one out. A world of difference, scoring opportunity-wise. If Gomes is going to score here, it\u2019s going to have to be on a hit and not an out. So, Turner is here looking for a chance. He falls behind 1-2 then fouls the next one off. The next pitch is out of the zone, it\u2019s 2-2. Turner grounds out and Gomes gets to third, but there\u2019s two out now. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 3rd Patrick Corbin is batting for himself. One has to assume that he will be bunting here. He pops the first pitch up foul but the catcher can\u2019t get to it. Still, not a good effort there for Corbin, who is down 0-1 in the count. Corbin\u2019s next bunt\u2026 does not advance the runner. (National League baseball everybody!) Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 3rd Yan Gomes is up for the Nationals and he takes a strike. Oh are we doing the in-game manager interview with Houston\u2019s AJ Hinch? It\u2019s Game 4 of the World Series, HE HAS MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO CARE ABOUT. Gomes fouls off the next pitch for a strike. Gomes keeps alive by fouling the next one off and then hits a solid double to lead things off. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 3rd Yuli Gurriel takes a mighty hack at a pitch outside the zone. 0-1. Gurriel fouls the next pitch. 0-2. And swings and misses. End of inning. Corbin has found his groove, it looks like. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 3rd Bregman is up with one on and one out but Corbin gets him to pop up to Kendrick on a 2-1 count. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 3rd Brantley takes a strike and then three straight balls. Again, the discipline of these Houston hitters can\u2019t be overlooked. On the fifth pitch of the at-bat he hits a single. There\u2019s been a lot of solid contact off Corbin so far. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 3rd Altuve is up and he hits a ball right to Rendon who makes a fantastic diving catch to rob him of a hit. Just ridiculous. Email from Roger Kirkby: Bar room quiz question (and answer) for ya. Who was the only base stealer to end a World Series? In game 7, bottom of the ninth with 2 outs? The answer Babe Ruth who got caught trying to steal second against the Cardinals in 1926. They lost the game 3-2. Bet he didn\u2019t have that one on his highlight reel. \u201cI always said he was a bum\u201d - Red Sox fans of the era Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 2nd Victor Robles is up and gets into an 0-2 count in beyond a blink. He swings and misses on pitch 3 and that\u2019s it. Bullpen game? What bullpen game? Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 2nd Ryan Zimmerman grounds out. Urquidy\u2019s been rather efficient so far. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 2nd The venerable Howie Kendrick is up to face Urquidy and he does his part to get him to throw pitches, working a full count on a borderline checked swing before whiffing on the same pitch. That\u2019s Urquidy\u2019s first strikeout. Email from Richard Woods: I see Aroldis chapman has been named AL Reliever of the Year. As A Blue Jays fan who this season has been obliged to look to the future and shield my eyes from the present, that at least gives me the chance to alert you to (or remind you of) one of the greatest at bats of the season. Chapman vs Vlady. I will gladly post any videos of players taking Chapman deep. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 2nd Okay I guess Urquidy is going to get a chance to have an at-bat thanks to Houston\u2019s productive first inning. If he hits a home run here this is officially the most hilarious plate appearance in World Series history. He does at least make contact, grounding out to third. He does do better than Springer who grounds out to Turner on the very first pitch. That was a much better inning for Corbin than the first. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 2nd Marisnick grounds out right back to Corbin for the first out of the second. Email from Debarr: Heading: Corbin They need to get him out of there. The same thing is happening tonight that happened last night and they left Sanchez in there way too long they are going to lose this game with Corbin if they leave him in there any longer. What\u2019s wrong with Martinez that he\u2019s leaving these lousy pitchers in there when they\u2019re not doing the job? Well, to be fair, there\u2019s a difference between leaving a pitcher too long and pulling them in the very first inning. And he did get the double-play to get out of the inning, that\u2019s a positive sign. But he will get a shorter leash than Sanchez, that\u2019s 100% certain. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 1st Juan Soto is up with a runner on first and the crowd chants his name. Soto smokes a ball but Bregman is literally right there to steal a single from the rising star. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 1st Anthony Rendon smokes a single and the Nationals have their first baserunner. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 1st Adam Eaton pops out in foul ground as well. I want to say that it\u2019s on BT Sport in the UK? I could be wrong about this. Astros 2-0 Nationals, bottom 1st Jose Urquidy is out now, pitching to Washington\u2019s Trea Turner, whom he gets to foul out to first. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 1st Robinson Chirinos swings through Corbin\u2019s first pitch to him. He was looking to drive multiple runs home right there. Corbin\u2019s next pitch is out of the zone. 1-1. As is the next. 2-1. The Nationals fans are getting restless now, this was the exact opposite of how they wanted this to start. And Chirinos hits into a double-play and Washington desperately needed that. He escapes without further damage. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 1st This is right around the time when it should be noted that there\u2019s a suspicion around the league that the Astros steal signs. Given how well they\u2019re seeing Corbin in this first inning, you can see why. The truth is, that part of it is just that they have a dangerous lineup (even if they haven\u2019t shown it for stretches during this postseason). Up next is Carlos Correa who works a full count, fouls the next pitch off, and then takes ball four. The bases are loaded with still just one out. Astros 2-0 Nationals, top 1st Gurriel scorches an infield single that Rendon can\u2019t do anything with and Brantley scores from third. Runners on first and second, still just one out for the Astros. Astros 1-0 Nationals, top 1st Bregman swings and hits a single that scores Altuve. Brantley gets to third base. We have runners on first-and-third with one out. Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st Corbin\u2019s first pitch to Michael Brantley is a ball and the second, well the second is a slider in his wheelhouse and he strokes a single into the outfield. The Astros have runners on first and second and just one out. Alex Bregman is at the plate. Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st Jose Altuve is up there and he decides that patience might not be a virtue as he hits a single off the first pitch he sees. Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st Springer works a full count against Corbin, which\u2026 there\u2019s been a whole lot of those this series. Springer fouls the 3-2 pitch off. And then he does the same with the next 3-2 pitch. This is exactly what the Astros lineup needs to do with Corbin: make him throw a zillion pitches and get into the soft underbelly of the Nationals bullpen. This time around, Corbin wins the battle as he gets a strikeout to start the inning. Astros 0-0 Nationals, top 1st Patrick Corbin\u2019s first pitch to George Springer is inside for a ball. Game 4 has begun! The FOX intros are leaning heavy into the \u201cnobody can win at home\u201d narrative and, I won\u2019t lie, it would be hilarious if the home team lost every game here. Email from Jonng Inbrasil: Hi from Brasil (this is the correct spelling). Am lucky here to be able to switch between Nationals/Astros as well as Notre Dame/Michigan college football and Houston/New Orleans NBA...so am looking forward to reading you tomorrow. Have a good night. I personally am missing Tacko Fall\u2019s potential NBA debut in the Celtics/Knicks game tonight, so I completely understand. That\u2019s a big reason why we do these liveblogs. There\u2019s a lot of sports going on right now, it\u2019s hard to watch them all. The U.S. Army Brass Quintet gives an instrumental rendition of the Star Spangled Banner and, as Jimi Hendrix once proved, instrumental versions of the anthem are always refreshing to hear. 8/10 Hey, as someone who will get more work if this series goes Game 6. I understand. Kurt Suzuki, who has had a brutal time behind the plate as far as getting dinged up, is out of the lineup with Yan Gomes taking his place. 1. Trea Turner, SS 2. Adam Eaton, RF 3. Anthony Rendon, 3B 4. Juan Soto, LF 5. Howie Kendrick, 2B 6. Ryan Zimmerman, 1B 7. Victor Robles, CF 8. Yan Gomes, C 9. Patrick Corbin, LHP The Fox booth is predicitng that Stephen Strasburg could be available out of the Nationals bullpen tonight if they need him. It would be interesting to see. I am uh not sure that Urquidy is going to get a chance to have an at-bat, but this is at least how the Houston lineup looks on paper. 1. George Springer, RF 2. Jose Altuve, 2B 3. Michael Brantley LF 4. Alex Bregman, 3B 5. Yuli Gurriel, 1B 6. Carlos Correa, SS 7. Robinson Chirinos, C 8. Jake Marisnick, CF 9. Jose Urquidy, RHP Predictions I guess this would make a great way to segue into predictions. Okay, I previously predicted that the Astros would win this in six games. For that to happen, they pretty much have to win tonight. However, I just don\u2019t see how this matchup is favorable for Houston unless Corbin implodes. Now, granted, that\u2019s entirely possible but it\u2019s a depressing thing to predict. So, sigh, Nationals 7, Astros 5 for a final. I don\u2019t feel *great* about this, mind you. Your thoughts? Send them via email to (hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or via Twitter (to @HunterFelt) and we\u2019ll post them here. Well, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves just yet. We\u2019ve got a long way to go. Since we still have some time to analyze the previous game before the start of the next, there\u2019s one last time to go over the biggest question from yesterday\u2019s game: did Dave Martinez screw up by letting starting pitcher Anibal Sanchez hit for himself in a crucial spot in Game 3? With the tying run at third, and one out, Martinez let Sanchez bat for himself. He ended up striking out on a foul bunt. The Nationals would never score again. It\u2019s hard not to second guess the strategy especially since Sanchez would go on to immediately allow another run. It was, however, less of a straight up blunder than a perhaps necessary gamble. As Michael Baumann points out in an article for the Ringer, it\u2019s a direct consequence of the manager not having trust in his objectively bad bullpen. In truth: it might not have mattered. If it feels like there hasn\u2019t been much turnaround between Games 3 and 4, well it\u2019s because there hasn\u2019t been. Last night\u2019s game didn\u2019t end until after midnight on the East Coast and that was without going into extra innings. I hope everybody has extra caffeine available for Game 4 because every indication is that we will have something of a long one ahead. Jose Urquidy will be starting for the Houston Astros, fresh off their 4-1 win in Game 3. While that\u2019s what he\u2019s listed at in the media guides, there\u2019s every reason to believe that he will be acting more like an Opener, going just a few innings before turning the game over to a stream of Astros relievers. So, you would think that having to rely on their bullpen would give Houston the disadvantage here. Well, perhaps. It all depends on how much depth Patrick Corbin can give the Nationals. Corbin himself has been working out of the bullpen during this postseason, he made an appearance back in Game 1, and there\u2019s a very real possibility that he won\u2019t be able to give his team more than a handful of effective innings. If Corbin can\u2019t go long, well, the Nationals bullpen remains their Achilles heel. All this means is that the Astros have a very good chance at evening out the World Series tonight, with Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander ready to go. If they lose? Well, being down 3-1, with another game left on the road, is not an ideal situation for any team, regardless of how good they have been all season long. This is a pivotal game, you could say, but hey they\u2019re all pivotal games in the World Series. As always, you can contribute to today\u2019s liveblog. Send your thoughts, jokes, rants and other assorted baseball-related takes to us either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or via Twitter (to @HunterFelt), we\u2019ll incorporate them throughout the next innings (and potentially beyond). It\u2019s Game 4 of the World Series between the Houston Astros and the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. First pitch is at 8:08pm EST, but we\u2019ll be back with assorted updates before then. Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s how Game 3 was decided:",

Stuff\u2019s national RWC Mood-O Meter \u2013 which was clocked at \u201cno worries\u201d on Friday afternoon, had swung to \u201cgutted\u201d by Sunday morning. But considering the passion many New Zealanders have for the game \u2013 often described as the national religion \u2013 it was a \u201cgutted\u201d mired in respect, resignation, and continued love for a game that can surprise and even delight a country so used to world domination.",

      "body": "<p> Ethical superannuation funds are on the rise.</p> <p>Especially for younger Australians, the idea of putting your super into something that makes the world better \u2013 or at least not actively worse \u2013 is an appealing pitch.</p> <p>These funds promise either positive action to invest in areas such as clean energy, or to not invest in sectors such as the arms industry (or both), all while growing your retirement savings. A 2017 poll conducted by the Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA) found <a href=\"https://responsibleinvestment.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/From-values-to-riches-Charting-consumer-attitudes-and-demand-for-responsible-investing-in-Australia-2017.pdf\">80% of Australians would be willing to switch funds</a> so their money is invested according to their values, and that rises to 88% among those aged 18-34.</p> <p>Four funds in Australia currently claim to be fully \u201cethical\u201d \u2013 Australian Ethical, Future Super, Local Government Super and Christian Super. Dozens of other funds provide \u201cethical\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d options \u2013 including UniSuper, Sunsuper and Australian Super, the country\u2019s largest.</p> <p>In the past five years, Australian Ethical has nearly quadrupled the amount of super it manages, from $<a href=\"https://www.australianethical.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20141024-FUM-at-30-September-2014.pdf\">639m</a> to <a href=\"https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20191011/pdf/449d4dq6vgzfl0.pdf\">$2.4bn</a>. Future Super, which was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/03/australian-tech-company-atlassian-urges-business-to-support-climate-strikes\">high-profile backer of the most recent school climate strike</a>, has grown by 15,000 members since its founding in 2014.</p> <p>But putting the word \u201cethical\u201d in the name of a fund does not in itself tell investors much.</p> <p>There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/02/one-afternoon-a-year-how-to-manage-your-superannuation-in-very-little-time\">no shortage of super tips floating around</a>, but if you want to invest ethically there is a further layer of complexity to the decision about where to put your money.</p> <p>Analysis from the consumer group Choice has found that some funds are not as ethical as they appear, and that in some cases it would be a better use of money to give it directly to the causes you support.</p> <h2>What exactly do we mean by ethical?</h2> <p>First, the definitions. There is nothing to stop anyone calling their fund \u201cethical\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d. These are just marketing terms. If they are grossly incorrect, they can constitute misleading and deceptive conduct \u2013 but it\u2019s a very high bar.</p> <p>And \u201cethical\u201d can mean anything from green energy to animal rights to bans on gambling and alcohol. There is no set definition.</p> <p>The closest thing we have to regulation is accreditation from the RIAA.</p> <p>The RIAA is a non-government body that promotes sustainable investment. When a fund volunteers to be accredited, the RIAA combs through its investments and very handily <a href=\"https://www.responsiblereturns.com.au/\">produces a searchable database</a> of what it does and does not do.</p> <p>Some of the largest funds\u2019 \u201cethical\u201d options \u2013 such as Australian Super\u2019s \u2013 are actually not accredited, and thus won\u2019t show up on the search, but others \u2013 including UniSuper\u2019s \u2013 are.</p> <p>RIAA accreditation is in-depth and rigorous but there are two things to keep in mind.</p> <p>First, under RIAA rules, a fund can be accredited with \u201cexcluding fossil fuels\u201d but still earn up to 20% of its revenue from fossil fuels.</p> <p>It\u2019s all in the fine print, and it varies from fund to fund.

      "bodyText": "Ethical superannuation funds are on the rise. Especially for younger Australians, the idea of putting your super into something that makes the world better \u2013 or at least not actively worse \u2013 is an appealing pitch. These funds promise either positive action to invest in areas such as clean energy, or to not invest in sectors such as the arms industry (or both), all while growing your retirement savings. A 2017 poll conducted by the Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA) found 80% of Australians would be willing to switch funds so their money is invested according to their values, and that rises to 88% among those aged 18-34. Four funds in Australia currently claim to be fully \u201cethical\u201d \u2013 Australian Ethical, Future Super, Local Government Super and Christian Super. Dozens of other funds provide \u201cethical\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d options \u2013 including UniSuper, Sunsuper and Australian Super, the country\u2019s largest. In the past five years, Australian Ethical has nearly quadrupled the amount of super it manages, from $639m to $2.4bn. Future Super, which was a high-profile backer of the most recent school climate strike, has grown by 15,000 members since its founding in 2014. But putting the word \u201cethical\u201d in the name of a fund does not in itself tell investors much. There\u2019s no shortage of super tips floating around, but if you want to invest ethically there is a further layer of complexity to the decision about where to put your money. Analysis from the consumer group Choice has found that some funds are not as ethical as they appear, and that in some cases it would be a better use of money to give it directly to the causes you support. What exactly do we mean by ethical? First, the definitions. There is nothing to stop anyone calling their fund \u201cethical\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d. These are just marketing terms. If they are grossly incorrect, they can constitute misleading and deceptive conduct \u2013 but it\u2019s a very high bar. And \u201cethical\u201d can mean anything from green energy to animal rights to bans on gambling and alcohol. There is no set definition. The closest thing we have to regulation is accreditation from the RIAA. The RIAA is a non-government body that promotes sustainable investment. When a fund volunteers to be accredited, the RIAA combs through its investments and very handily produces a searchable database of what it does and does not do. Some of the largest funds\u2019 \u201cethical\u201d options \u2013 such as Australian Super\u2019s \u2013 are actually not accredited, and thus won\u2019t show up on the search, but others \u2013 including UniSuper\u2019s \u2013 are. RIAA accreditation is in-depth and rigorous but there are two things to keep in mind. First, under RIAA rules, a fund can be accredited with \u201cexcluding fossil fuels\u201d but still earn up to 20% of its revenue from fossil fuels. It\u2019s all in the fine print, and it varies from fund to fund. For example, First State Super\u2019s \u201cSocially Responsible\u201d option only blocks companies that earn more than 20% of their revenue from coal, oil and gas. Other funds, such as Future Super, promise full, 100% fossil fuel exclusions. Second, the RIAA does not impose any definition of \u201cethical\u201d, other than a minimum standard that means every fund on its list must not invest in tobacco companies and armaments. Otherwise it simply does the work to check if a fund\u2019s investments align with its value statement. Not everyone\u2019s ethics are the same Some funds will care about labour rights or gender parity, others have radically different priorities. Christian Super will not invest in anything that provides intra-uterine devices, abortion medication, or stem cell research \u2013 in according with its ethics, which are disclosed on the RIAA site. \u201cIt\u2019s about ensuring that investment products are delivering on what they are promising,\u201d says the chief executive of the RIAA, Simon O\u2019Connor. \u201cWe don\u2019t tell them at what point they draw the line but we get them to verify where they draw the line, disclose it in all their legal documentation, then we verify that.\u201d These nuances are mostly provided on the RIAA database. But for the most detail \u2013 and some of it can be crucial \u2013 you will have dig around on each individual fund\u2019s website, and if it\u2019s not there, call or email them. For example, Australian Ethical will positively invest in aged care, as well as banning investments in coal, coal-seam gas and oil. VicSuper\u2019s \u201cSocially Conscious\u201d option, by contrast, has no positive inclusions. And finally, downstream investments also have to be considered. A fund may divest from fossil-fuel companies, but still invest in a bank that then invests in fossil fuels; or it may invest in a shipping company that makes most of its profit moving coal. Another example is supermarkets. Your fund may blacklist cigarette makers, but it probably invests in Coles and Woolworths, which sell cigarettes over the counter. The RIAA does not by default investigate downstream investments. Again, if your fund promises to take downstream investments into account, the RIAA will check it \u2013 if not, it won\u2019t. The cost of ethics There is a lingering question around whether super is the most effective way to drive change. In September, the head of Hostplus said divesting from coal was \u201ca waste of time\u201d \u2013 because those shares would just be bought by other people. Instead, he advocated putting direct pressure on governments. Xavier O\u2019Halloran from Choice says that if your fund eats into your returns (either through high fees or just bad performance), you might be better off donating or investing that money direct to the cause. \u201cWe found with some of these ethical funds the fees are pretty high compared to the market average,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve really got to weigh up the returns you are getting compared to the fees.\u201d It\u2019s easy to underestimate how much fees chip away at super. It\u2019s the magic of compounding. An apparently negligible 0.8 percentage point difference in fees can add up to $123,000 less in super over a lifetime. \u201cOn a purely mathematical analysis you might be better off going with a more traditional fund,\u201d O\u2019Halloran says. \u201cThen you can make a contribution more directly.\u201d But O\u2019Connor from the RIAA disagrees, pointing to the effectiveness of divestment from tobacco. \u201cWe have seen 35 super funds divest from tobacco in the past five years.

The girl was freed on Friday by Philippine national police and Australian federal police officers at a property in the city of Rizal, about a two-hour drive from Manila. Police also arrested a 39-year-old woman as part of the raid. The investigation into the Sydney man and possible Philippines-based offenders was sparked after the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) referred the child abuse allegations to the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation in July 2019. Last month, police in New South Wales raided the man\u2019s home in Sydney\u2019s North Rocks, seizing electronic devices they allege contained child abuse material. The 63-year-old is now facing charges including procuring a child to engage in sexual activity outside Australia, using a carriage service to solicit child pornography, transmitting child pornography material and possessing child abuse material. It will be alleged that the man communicated with people offshore to procure the children \u2013 via a trusted adult \u2013 to produce and transmit child abuse material at his request, police said. He is due to face Parramatta local court on 22 November. Police did not rule out further arrests and said they expected to charge the woman detained at Rizal on Friday. The girl has been placed in the care of the Philippines\u2019 Department of Social Welfare and Development. The AFP\u2019s senior officer in Manila, federal agent Andrew Perkins, said: \u201cSadly there is an appetite for child abuse material online which leads to vulnerable children becoming pawns in a form of abuse that can have devastating impacts. \u201cThe arrest and rescue sends a strong message that, if you are taking part in this vile industry, law enforcement will find you.\u201d Police urged anyone with information to report their suspicions through the Report Child Abuse link on the AFP website, via Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or their social media provider.

      "bodyText": "More than \u00a350bn \u2013 that\u2019s what the PPI scandal has cost Britain\u2019s banks. How much more will become clearer this week when Lloyds, the biggest seller of the dud product, winds up the banks\u2019 trading statement season on Thursday. PPI \u2013 short for payment protection insurance \u2013 is the biggest rip-off in British banking history. The bill so far for repaying customers and handling claims is as much as \u00a353.3bn \u2013 more than five times the cost of the London Olympics \u2013 according to the New City Agenda thinktank. Banks sold PPI from the mid-90s until 2012, promising to cover customers\u2019 loan repayments if they became ill or unemployed. The policies were often worthless, because they failed to pay out or weren\u2019t needed in the first place. The product was highly profitable and was given the hard sell. Staff selling loans were rewarded for flogging PPI and were under pressure to meet targets. The deadline for claims was 29 August, leading to a surge in cases that took many banks by surprise. Last week Royal Bank of Scotland set aside \u00a3900m for PPI \u2013 at the top of its estimates \u2013 sending it to a quarterly loss. Barclays set aside \u00a31.4bn \u2013 in the middle of its guidance. Tomorrow we\u2019ll hear from HSBC, followed by Santander on Wednesday and Lloyds on Thursday. Lloyds\u2019 PPI provision is almost \u00a322bn. After the PPI deadline, the bank said it expected to set aside between \u00a31.2bn and \u00a31.8bn for the third quarter. Ultimately, the banks have lost money on PPI. The industry received \u00a344bn of premiums and made profits of at least \u00a321bn. Even after adding interest charged, profits are dwarfed by the cost of putting things right. Could it happen again? Personal finance will always be fertile ground for companies peddling murky products. Cases such as the RBS\u2019s treatment of small-business customers and the banks\u2019 reluctant handling of PPI cast doubt on lenders\u2019 claims to have cleaned up their act. The incentives for bank bosses haven\u2019t changed much either. Lloyds clawed back some bonuses from former chief executive Eric Daniels but Daniels was not fined and continues to work in financial services. The only fine for a chief executive who oversaw PPI was \u00a314,000 imposed on the boss of sofa store Land of Leather. Daniels\u2019 replacement, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, was docked a mere \u00a3234,000 from his bonus in 2015 after Lloyds \u2013 which, like RBS, was partly owned by taxpayers \u2013 was fined a record \u00a3117m for not treating PPI claimants fairly. His total pay that year was \u00a38.5m. Dominic Lindley, New City Agenda\u2019s director of policy, said: \u201cOverall the banks have suffered a loss but that has fallen on the current crop of shareholders and, with Lloyds and RBS, taxpayers.
