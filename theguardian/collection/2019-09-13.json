Major Roads Projects Victoria wants to bulldoze the DjabWurrung women\u2019s business country for the Western Highway Duplication project. This is a landscape that forms the basis of DjabWurrung identity \u2013 from the roots of the trees that are more than 800 years old, the rolling hills, the kangaroos, eagles and black cockatoos, to the stories of the stars, the moon and the sun. You cannot have one element of country without the other. The government has said it has permission from traditional owners. This is not true. They have met some Aboriginal people, but they have been mostly men, and they haven\u2019t consulted with the DjabWurrung women, whose country it is. The Victorian government\u2019s website explains that family violence is not limited to physical or sexual abuse; it includes emotional abuse and any threatening, coercive or controlling behaviour. Where there is an imbalance of power, the likelihood of falling victim to a violent, unhealthy relationship increases. With the royal commission into family violence in mind, the \u201cprogressive\u201d Andrews Labor government is well aware of what an unhealthy, abusive, controlling relationship is and the long-term impacts these actions have on people. I am a DjabWurrung woman and I work in the family violence sector. When recently attending a training session, my mind subconsciously kept linking the feelings associated with an abusive relationship to those I now experience as a DjabWurrung woman fighting alongside my aunties, sisters, brothers and cousins to protect sacred country from destruction in the western district of Victoria. As I sat in this training, I had this overwhelming realisation that we as DjabWurrung women were in an abusive relationship with the Andrews Labor government and within that moment I felt this chilling feeling. In my analysis of this complex abusive relationship where consent is being manufactured through other related parties, I have also identified the honeymoon period, which is the Andrews Labor government\u2019s current treaty agenda. The spoken words within treaty negotiations do not mirror the actions of this government, and this forces you to question the legitimacy of treaty negotiations and the government\u2019s controlled self-determination agenda. Not only are we as DjabWurrung women fighting for the protection of our country, but the journey of this fight is also bringing to the surface the truths of the manufactured consent the government obtains through its flawed processes and decision-making bodies. We have the Registered Aboriginal Parties, which is not truly representative of the community. We have an Aboriginal Corporation, which without consulting its own board or the people it claims to represent, has given the green light for the project. This is collusion and is creating division. This is a violent tactic to ensure the grassroots voices of DjabWurrung women are suppressed, undervalued and unheard, leaving us with no other option than to rally in the streets and put our bodies on the frontline. The DjabWurrung women do not consent to the Western Highway Duplication project ripping through our country without proper consultation and recognition of our rights as sovereign peoples. We as DjabWurrung women are distressed about the eviction notice currently in place; we are distressed as our voices and our elders\u2019 voices are going unheard; we will continue to call out the manufactured consent that the government is obtaining and we will stand united to protect what grounds us as sovereign women \u2013 country. I as a DjabWurrung woman and a candidate for the treaty assembly, feel conflicted and confused about the Andrews Labor government\u2019s agenda. You cannot claim to be progressive in working alongside Aboriginal peoples in this state if you\u2019re destroying sacred country at the same time. I believe we are all witnessing a historic moment, where people are uniting together to call out abusive, controlling, power-hungry behaviours being committed towards DjabWurrung country and people. We call on the Victorian government to meet with DjabWurrung women and to commit to an independent inquiry into traditional owner approvals across the state.

I believe strongly that the outcome of this long drawn-out fight, will make or break the future relationship between Aboriginal people in Victoria and the Andrews government.

      "bodyText": "Joe Cokanasiga has revealed he still suffers from pre-match nerves when playing for England, citing matches against Wales and Australia \u2013 both potential quarter-final opponents at the World Cup \u2013 as examples. Cokanasiga has scored five tries in his six England starts to date, bursting on to the scene last autumn and demonstrating why Eddie Jones fast-tracked him into the World Cup squad with a fine display against Ireland last month. The 21-year-old\u2019s second cap came against the Wallabies last November and he has made three appearances against Wales in his short career so far but the 6ft 4in, 19st Cokanasiga has admitted he is plagued by self-doubt against the two teams England are most likely to face in the last eight at the World Cup, should they emerge from their pool. \u201cI get quite nervous playing against the big teams like Australia and Wales, and sometimes I question myself whether I can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then once I\u2019m in the game I\u2019m back to my normal sense and just try to do what I do. Obviously I hate being nervous but it shows that you do care. But once that whistle goes, something just goes and you think: \u2018I\u2019m here for a reason\u2019 so just try to show it. It\u2019s gone pretty quickly for me. I haven\u2019t really had time to think about it and process everything, but looking back it\u2019s been a dream come true. Hopefully I can keep building on that.\u201d As England continue their preparations in Miyazaki \u2013 Eddie Jones took his squad paddleboarding on Friday \u2013 South Africa\u2019s World Cup buildup was rocked when it emerged Eben Etzebeth is being investigated by prosecutors over his involvement in an alleged assault and racial abuse during a bar brawl last month. Furthermore the former Springboks head coach Pieter de Villiers has said he will not be supporting South Africa at the World Cup because of the team\u2019s handling of allegations. Etzebeth denies any wrongdoing. \u201cBy simply accepting Etzebeth\u2019s word and not launching an investigation, SA Rugby missed an opportunity to show that they are serious about stamping out racism,\u201d De Villiers told Planet Rugby. \u201cI therefore cannot support the Springboks at this year\u2019s World Cup.\u201d New Zealand have also been dealt a blow with the news the flanker Luke Jacobson has been ruled out of the World Cup because of a delayed onset of concussion and will be replaced by Shannon Frizell. The 22-year-old Jacobson had played only 20 minutes off the bench against Argentina before he was named in the squad for the tournament. He came off the bench against Tonga on 7 September and did not suffer any problems until the All Blacks arrived in Japan and he developed symptoms after their first training session. \u201cAfter discussing this latest episode with Luke, as well as our medical team, the decision has been made to, sadly, withdraw him from the tournament,\u201d the All Blacks coach, Steve Hansen, said. \u201cWe all felt the best thing for him to do is to take a break from rugby until he is symptom-free. While it was a tough conversation to have, ultimately it was a very simple decision. Luke\u2019s health is the most important thing.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Before this year\u2019s Ashes the contest was expected to be two good bowling attacks against two brittle batting line-ups. In large part that has played out. One exception has been that across the first four Tests, Australia fielded three excellent fast bowlers to England\u2019s two. The other exception, which creates rather a large skew, has been Steve Smith producing one of the most dominant sequences of batting ever recorded.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s fast bowlers have mixed and matched around a core of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, giving England\u2019s batsmen no break at all. England have had Stuart Broad in vintage form and Jofra Archer bringing a whole new energy but Chris Woakes has been marginalised and modestly effective, and his temporary replacement Craig Overton offered more with bat than ball.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/13/jofra-archer-steve-smith-ashes-cricket\">Jofra Archer says flu-ridden Steve Smith \u2018didn\u2019t look as nailed on as usual\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both attacks have been refreshed with all-rounders in the final Test, with Mitchell Marsh taking his first Test five-for, mostly on the first day, before Sam Curran grabbed an important three wickets for England on the second.</p> <p>But still in Smith-free circumstances England\u2019s line-leaders on their own might have been enough. Broad has so utterly toasted David Warner that the Australian opener came out at the Oval going wild against Archer, swinging and missing at balls so wide they barely landed on the cut strip. The last time Warner played like this he smoked 30 from 13 balls in Cape Town before losing his stumps, one day before he got busted sandpapering the match ball. Let us just say it does not betray a serene state of mind.</p> <p>Warner has been out in single figures eight times out of nine. Two other openers have failed apace. Usman Khawaja, who could have opened, had already been dropped from No 3. Travis Head at No 5 was punted while Matthew Wade bashed one declaration hundred but has not looked reliable at the crease. Tim Paine has produced one defiant innings from No 7 but needed more.</p> <p>Had No 4 been filled by a batsman of similar calibre, Australia might have come to the Oval trailing 4-0. Instead the visitors have had Smith, meaning the fifth Test panned out like the fourth, and the second, and the first. He came to the crease at two down for bugger-all, batted through the departures of his colleagues, then did what he could with the tail.</p> <p>His 80 was his lowest score for the series in six attempts. What has stood out most about this absurdly prolific run is how the atmosphere of an innings has changed every time he has walked in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>When a team takes an early wicket, spirits are high. You are up, they are down. Celebrations erupt. A second wicket should be even better. Yet since his hundred on the first day of the series, a sense of foreboding seems to spread through the ground when a second wicket falls. In comes Smith and out go hopes of taking a third.</p> <p>Most notable is the way that Smith has neutralised England\u2019s best. Broad has moved the ball viciously from around the wicket to Australia\u2019s left-handers, taking edges on one side of the bat, pads and stumps on the other. As soon as Smith has arrived, Broad suddenly appears to shrink back into being a modest right-arm trundler.</p> <p>With Smith\u2019s movement outside his off stump, any lateral movement Broad can find is negated. Smith is happy to treat the bowler with respect much of the time, defending in between knocking a run or two to square-leg, but the boundaries he carved through cover at the Oval had more than a hint of dismissiveness.</p> <p>Archer was in with a chance early in the innings, drawing a couple of indiscreet pushes. But while England supporters seem to think the Archer bouncer is a secret weapon, Smith has calmly got underneath it ever since he was hit on an uneven pitch at Lord\u2019s. No one in the world is less impressed by the delivery.</p> <p>Soon enough, runs came from Archer as easily. When wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow burst out laughing after fooling Smith into a dive while taking a run, Smith immediately played a leg-side flick from Archer so pure that no one moved before it hit the fence. Don\u2019t mess with me, it seemed to say.</p> <p>In the end perhaps even Smith was tired after a long series, missing a ball from Woakes that hit his pad directly in front. England would have seen it as a victory to get him for only 80. Australia were rolled over 69 runs behind, Archer taking six wickets. But again the contributions around Smith were barely there. Without him that deficit alone would have been match-losing. For now Australia remain in the game. What a series England\u2019s bowlers might have given their team had it not been for the batting of one man.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Before this year\u2019s Ashes the contest was expected to be two good bowling attacks against two brittle batting line-ups. In large part that has played out. One exception has been that across the first four Tests, Australia fielded three excellent fast bowlers to England\u2019s two. The other exception, which creates rather a large skew, has been Steve Smith producing one of the most dominant sequences of batting ever recorded. Australia\u2019s fast bowlers have mixed and matched around a core of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, giving England\u2019s batsmen no break at all. England have had Stuart Broad in vintage form and Jofra Archer bringing a whole new energy but Chris Woakes has been marginalised and modestly effective, and his temporary replacement Craig Overton offered more with bat than ball. Both attacks have been refreshed with all-rounders in the final Test, with Mitchell Marsh taking his first Test five-for, mostly on the first day, before Sam Curran grabbed an important three wickets for England on the second. But still in Smith-free circumstances England\u2019s line-leaders on their own might have been enough. Broad has so utterly toasted David Warner that the Australian opener came out at the Oval going wild against Archer, swinging and missing at balls so wide they barely landed on the cut strip. The last time Warner played like this he smoked 30 from 13 balls in Cape Town before losing his stumps, one day before he got busted sandpapering the match ball. Let us just say it does not betray a serene state of mind. Warner has been out in single figures eight times out of nine. Two other openers have failed apace. Usman Khawaja, who could have opened, had already been dropped from No 3. Travis Head at No 5 was punted while Matthew Wade bashed one declaration hundred but has not looked reliable at the crease. Tim Paine has produced one defiant innings from No 7 but needed more. Had No 4 been filled by a batsman of similar calibre, Australia might have come to the Oval trailing 4-0. Instead the visitors have had Smith, meaning the fifth Test panned out like the fourth, and the second, and the first. He came to the crease at two down for bugger-all, batted through the departures of his colleagues, then did what he could with the tail. His 80 was his lowest score for the series in six attempts. What has stood out most about this absurdly prolific run is how the atmosphere of an innings has changed every time he has walked in. When a team takes an early wicket, spirits are high. You are up, they are down. Celebrations erupt. A second wicket should be even better. Yet since his hundred on the first day of the series, a sense of foreboding seems to spread through the ground when a second wicket falls. In comes Smith and out go hopes of taking a third. Most notable is the way that Smith has neutralised England\u2019s best. Broad has moved the ball viciously from around the wicket to Australia\u2019s left-handers, taking edges on one side of the bat, pads and stumps on the other. As soon as Smith has arrived, Broad suddenly appears to shrink back into being a modest right-arm trundler. With Smith\u2019s movement outside his off stump, any lateral movement Broad can find is negated. Smith is happy to treat the bowler with respect much of the time, defending in between knocking a run or two to square-leg, but the boundaries he carved through cover at the Oval had more than a hint of dismissiveness. Archer was in with a chance early in the innings, drawing a couple of indiscreet pushes. But while England supporters seem to think the Archer bouncer is a secret weapon, Smith has calmly got underneath it ever since he was hit on an uneven pitch at Lord\u2019s. No one in the world is less impressed by the delivery. Soon enough, runs came from Archer as easily. When wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow burst out laughing after fooling Smith into a dive while taking a run, Smith immediately played a leg-side flick from Archer so pure that no one moved before it hit the fence. Don\u2019t mess with me, it seemed to say. In the end perhaps even Smith was tired after a long series, missing a ball from Woakes that hit his pad directly in front. England would have seen it as a victory to get him for only 80. Australia were rolled over 69 runs behind, Archer taking six wickets. But again the contributions around Smith were barely there. Without him that deficit alone would have been match-losing. For now Australia remain in the game. What a series England\u2019s bowlers might have given their team had it not been for the batting of one man.",

      "body": "<p>Australia is experiencing one of its most severe droughts on record, resulting in desperate water shortages across large parts of New South Wales and southern Queensland. Dams in some parts of western NSW have all but dried up, with rainfall levels through the winter in the lowest 10% of historical records in some areas.</p> \n<p>The crisis in the far west of the state became unavoidable after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/07/hundreds-of-thousands-of-native-fish-dead-in-second-murray-darling-incident\">mass fish kills</a> along the lower Darling River last summer, but now much bigger towns closer to the coast, including Dubbo, are also running out of water.</p> \n<p>Residents of three distinct areas talked to Guardian Australia about the state of their towns under extreme stress from water shortages, expressing anxiety about their future but also determination to keep communities alive.</p> \n<h2>Dubbo, NSW</h2> \n<p>It seems unthinkable that the city of Dubbo, with a population of 40,000 and home to the Western Plains Zoo, could be facing the prospect of running out of water by mid- 2020. But as the drought enters its second summer, that\u2019s exactly what is facing the main town in the central west of NSW.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s also raising questions about management of water in the region, as irrigators in the basin have been permitted to continue to take water in the expectation that inflows would occur. Instead inflows into the Macquarie River are at historic lows.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"345f7ee298184f26d1a2dc3d467876a4f3eacf66\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/345f7ee298184f26d1a2dc3d467876a4f3eacf66/0_0_3992_2992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burrendong Dam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burrendong Dam, which supplies Dubbo and surrounding towns.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The vast Burrendong dam on the Macquarie \u2013 six times the size of Sydney Harbour and the main water source for Dubbo, Wellington, Narromine, Nyngan, Cobar and Warren \u2013 is now at 4.5% capacity and dwindling rapidly as unseasonably high temperatures hit the region.</p> \n<p>This is not just a matter of water restrictions and inconvenience. The drought and water shortages spell potential economic catastrophe for Dubbo as farmers leave fields unplanted and sell off stock, tourist numbers wither and parks and gardens turn brown.</p> \n<p>Dubbo still looks like an oasis in the brown landscape that surrounds it, despite being on level two restrictions.</p> \n<p>But tougher level three restrictions are imminent if there is no spring rain, as the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting. Then the city will rapidly go to level five, then level six.</p> \n<p>That means no watering of lawns and parks. Some of the council\u2019s pools will be emptied and residents will be required to use no more than 120 litres a day \u2013 half the amount now permitted. That means short showers and limited use of evaporative coolers, in a summer when the temperature on most days will be well over 30C.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are no records of the sort of drought that we are experiencing,\u201d says the chief executive of Dubbo council, Michael McMahon. \u201cAt the same time the population has grown and there are more businesses here.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff5085dd4d24f546f49c07d462c104a2eeb7eb78\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff5085dd4d24f546f49c07d462c104a2eeb7eb78/0_0_5331_3561/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duckweed on the Macquarie River.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A huge mat of red duckweed floats on the surface of the Macquarie River.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A fortnight ago the state government announced a $30m program to sink more bores, and McMahon says he hopes to shift to roughly 50/50 bore and dam water by March.</p> \n<p>But there are serious questions about whether groundwater in sufficient quantity and quality can be found to support all the people who rely on Burrendong.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m quite concerned that the groundwater they find won\u2019t be enough or of good enough quality to help Dubbo,\u201d says the Healthy Rivers Dubbo convenor, Melissa Gray.</p> \n<p>She points to a risk assessment by state water authorities in November 2018 that found the risk of compaction and subsidence, caused by extraction of groundwater, was high in several zones of the Macquarie aquifer. There is also a high risk of poor quality water travelling through the aquifer as water is withdrawn at other points.</p> \n<p>Bill Johnson, a former Murray-Darling Basin Authority senior staff member, says the problem is the climate is getting hotter and drier but allocations are being made on the expectation of previous dry times.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t plenty of water for towns now because too much has been given to irrigation in the recent past,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>McMahon also acknowledges concerns about bore water. He is confident it can be treated to provide drinking water but says there are limits to how much can be extracted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53a239dc91c6cbb139bb7b306df0ab9a5c7adbfa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53a239dc91c6cbb139bb7b306df0ab9a5c7adbfa/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hippo enclosure at the Western Plains zoo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Hippo enclosure at the Western Plains zoo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Astoundingly, farms with groundwater entitlements are still permitted to extract from underground aquifers for irrigation, Gray says. \u201cThey can still flood irrigate with groundwater so, despite the conditions, there will be cotton grown in this region this year.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the meantime some of the city\u2019s big water users, including the zoo, are trying to reduce water use further.</p> \n<p>The zoo has a 500-megalitre allocation from Burrendong, which it uses for its non-potable water, mainly for the irrigation of lawns, for water features and moats around enclosures, and for growing \u201cbrowse\u201d feed for animals.</p> \n<p>The zoo\u2019s director, Steve Hinks, says it has already cut irrigation back significantly to 340ML a year but is looking at what else can be done, through greater recycling.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe hold 50ML on site at any one time,\u201d he says. \u201cThe water is stored in a reservoir and flows through a lake system, so the hippo lake here is one of the last lakes in our natural system.\u201d</p> \n<p>The zoo is installing a pump system to take the hippo lake water back to the reservoir, where it will run through a series of natural wetlands to purify it.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can not only reuse the water and get a longer lifespan, but we are creating an environment for a lot of the native bird species,\u201d Hinks says.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if it rains in the next few months we will forge ahead with this project as it sets us up for the future, because historically droughts are cyclical, and historically people tend to put the changes on hold.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"2339ed9acd9d026152d9c313c6ee07f0d1ec2d4b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2339ed9acd9d026152d9c313c6ee07f0d1ec2d4b/0_0_5113_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Albert Priest channel where it crosses the Dubbo-Nyngan road.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Albert Priest channel where it crosses the Dubbo-Nyngan road.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe are planning for the eventuality of no water in Burrendong but I don\u2019t think we would necessarily close the zoo or drastically reduce the animals here.

Nyngan, which sits on the red soil plains 120km to the north-west, was seared into the national consciousness in 1990 when the Bogan River overran its banks, inundating the town of just over 2,000 people.</p> \n<p>Such excesses are now a distant memory. There has been no rain since 2016 and the town is relying on a combination of its off-river storage, shrewdly built by the council in 2017, and a channel that brings water from Dubbo and the Burrendong.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4fcfe14ec265f1df09206f95d47af44843d81ca1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fcfe14ec265f1df09206f95d47af44843d81ca1/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The ruins of the train station at Girilambone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ruins of the train station at Girilambone.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cHaving this backup makes it a lot better than it would be,\u201d says Nyngan\u2019s water manager, Trevor Waterhouse.

      "bodyText": "Australia is experiencing one of its most severe droughts on record, resulting in desperate water shortages across large parts of New South Wales and southern Queensland. Dams in some parts of western NSW have all but dried up, with rainfall levels through the winter in the lowest 10% of historical records in some areas. The crisis in the far west of the state became unavoidable after the mass fish kills along the lower Darling River last summer, but now much bigger towns closer to the coast, including Dubbo, are also running out of water. Residents of three distinct areas talked to Guardian Australia about the state of their towns under extreme stress from water shortages, expressing anxiety about their future but also determination to keep communities alive. Dubbo, NSW It seems unthinkable that the city of Dubbo, with a population of 40,000 and home to the Western Plains Zoo, could be facing the prospect of running out of water by mid- 2020. But as the drought enters its second summer, that\u2019s exactly what is facing the main town in the central west of NSW. It\u2019s also raising questions about management of water in the region, as irrigators in the basin have been permitted to continue to take water in the expectation that inflows would occur. Instead inflows into the Macquarie River are at historic lows. The vast Burrendong dam on the Macquarie \u2013 six times the size of Sydney Harbour and the main water source for Dubbo, Wellington, Narromine, Nyngan, Cobar and Warren \u2013 is now at 4.5% capacity and dwindling rapidly as unseasonably high temperatures hit the region. This is not just a matter of water restrictions and inconvenience. The drought and water shortages spell potential economic catastrophe for Dubbo as farmers leave fields unplanted and sell off stock, tourist numbers wither and parks and gardens turn brown. Dubbo still looks like an oasis in the brown landscape that surrounds it, despite being on level two restrictions. But tougher level three restrictions are imminent if there is no spring rain, as the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting. Then the city will rapidly go to level five, then level six. That means no watering of lawns and parks. Some of the council\u2019s pools will be emptied and residents will be required to use no more than 120 litres a day \u2013 half the amount now permitted. That means short showers and limited use of evaporative coolers, in a summer when the temperature on most days will be well over 30C. \u201cThere are no records of the sort of drought that we are experiencing,\u201d says the chief executive of Dubbo council, Michael McMahon. \u201cAt the same time the population has grown and there are more businesses here.\u201d A fortnight ago the state government announced a $30m program to sink more bores, and McMahon says he hopes to shift to roughly 50/50 bore and dam water by March. But there are serious questions about whether groundwater in sufficient quantity and quality can be found to support all the people who rely on Burrendong. \u201cI\u2019m quite concerned that the groundwater they find won\u2019t be enough or of good enough quality to help Dubbo,\u201d says the Healthy Rivers Dubbo convenor, Melissa Gray. She points to a risk assessment by state water authorities in November 2018 that found the risk of compaction and subsidence, caused by extraction of groundwater, was high in several zones of the Macquarie aquifer. There is also a high risk of poor quality water travelling through the aquifer as water is withdrawn at other points. Bill Johnson, a former Murray-Darling Basin Authority senior staff member, says the problem is the climate is getting hotter and drier but allocations are being made on the expectation of previous dry times. \u201cThere isn\u2019t plenty of water for towns now because too much has been given to irrigation in the recent past,\u201d he says. McMahon also acknowledges concerns about bore water. He is confident it can be treated to provide drinking water but says there are limits to how much can be extracted. Astoundingly, farms with groundwater entitlements are still permitted to extract from underground aquifers for irrigation, Gray says. \u201cThey can still flood irrigate with groundwater so, despite the conditions, there will be cotton grown in this region this year.\u201d In the meantime some of the city\u2019s big water users, including the zoo, are trying to reduce water use further. The zoo has a 500-megalitre allocation from Burrendong, which it uses for its non-potable water, mainly for the irrigation of lawns, for water features and moats around enclosures, and for growing \u201cbrowse\u201d feed for animals. The zoo\u2019s director, Steve Hinks, says it has already cut irrigation back significantly to 340ML a year but is looking at what else can be done, through greater recycling. \u201cWe hold 50ML on site at any one time,\u201d he says. \u201cThe water is stored in a reservoir and flows through a lake system, so the hippo lake here is one of the last lakes in our natural system.\u201d The zoo is installing a pump system to take the hippo lake water back to the reservoir, where it will run through a series of natural wetlands to purify it. \u201cWe can not only reuse the water and get a longer lifespan, but we are creating an environment for a lot of the native bird species,\u201d Hinks says. \u201cEven if it rains in the next few months we will forge ahead with this project as it sets us up for the future, because historically droughts are cyclical, and historically people tend to put the changes on hold. \u201cWe are planning for the eventuality of no water in Burrendong but I don\u2019t think we would necessarily close the zoo or drastically reduce the animals here. We are working closely with Water NSW and council about options such as sinking bores on site, and desalination and sewage treatment and recycling.\u201d The further you travel from Dubbo, the more acute the problems are. Nyngan, which sits on the red soil plains 120km to the north-west, was seared into the national consciousness in 1990 when the Bogan River overran its banks, inundating the town of just over 2,000 people. Such excesses are now a distant memory. There has been no rain since 2016 and the town is relying on a combination of its off-river storage, shrewdly built by the council in 2017, and a channel that brings water from Dubbo and the Burrendong. \u201cHaving this backup makes it a lot better than it would be,\u201d says Nyngan\u2019s water manager, Trevor Waterhouse. It holds about 700ML, which is close to a year\u2019s water for the town, particularly with water restrictions. But it depends on water from Burrendong, brought by the 66km Albert Priest channel. Further west along the road to Bourke, the situation is already dire. Girilambone, population 26, is already part of the way towards becoming a ghost town but this drought could be the last straw. The town water supply ran out six months ago and water is now trucked in every two days. The rail line to Bourke closed in 1986 and, since then, the town has been in retreat. The station is derelict. The hotel burned down. The general store and petrol station closed two years ago. \u201cThe mines [at Cobar and Girilambone] have already had meetings and said if they don\u2019t have rain before January, it\u2019s no more,\u201d says Darren Painter, who runs the hotel in the old RSL. \u201cThis is the only small business here. In turn that will shut us too. \u201cThere\u2019s not much laughter here in the pub these days. The farmers try to come in to buy two beers but then they have to go. \u201cAh, but it will be all right. We\u2019ve got through this before.\u201d Warwick and Stanthorpe, Queensland After 73 days it rained a trickle in the southern Queensland town of Warwick in August. Few locals celebrated the end of the longest dry spell in living memory. The drought had passed the point where 5mm in the rain gauge could make a drop of difference. \u201cWarwick is a fantastic town, a very proud town, but it\u2019s on its knees,\u201d says Ian Macdonald, who runs a local garden nursery with his son, Brent. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we ever come back from this. Because if it rained tonight, it doesn\u2019t rain money and we\u2019re about a quarter of a million dollars down the gurgler.\u201d Warwick is on track to run out of water within months. Roadside signs heading into town remind residents of the new restrictions: 100 litres per person, per day. Locals take pride in their rose gardens \u2013 shopping centres and hotels and Chinese restaurants are named after Warwick\u2019s signature flower. Each year in October the Rose and Rodeo festival is the town\u2019s showpiece event. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford the money to bring in roses this year because no one is buying and you\u2019d quite easily do your arse taking a gamble,\u201d Macdonald says. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t get about a drought is that it hurts everybody \u2026 If the farmers have got no money, none of us have got any money ... People don\u2019t buy plants to take home. They don\u2019t stop after the cattle sales and buy a pie at the pie shop.\u201d In Stanthorpe, 60km to the south, \u201cday zero\u201d \u2013 when drinking water supply runs dry \u2013 is approaching just as quickly. The towns in Queensland\u2019s Southern Downs and Granite Belt are hubs for primary producers; mostly fruit and vegetable growers. Last month the Granite Belt Growers Association estimated the reduction in wages and expenditure would cost the local economy $100m. Ann Bourke from Jester Hill Wines \u2013 a spokeswoman for the Granite Belt Wine Tourism body \u2013 says the latest vintage was picked a month earlier than usual, and most local winemakers now have business plans that assume they will lose one harvest in every five. \u201cIt\u2019s costing us $2,000 a week to buy in water,\u201d Bourke says. \u201cWe\u2019re still in two minds, do we throw the dollars at buying more water and have a vintage, or do we concentrate on just keeping the vines alive?\u201d Some of the bigger farms have decided not to plant this year, which means there is no additional work, and few backpackers in town. \u201cThat means there\u2019s less people employed, families might move away, next year our school numbers will drop,\u201d says Amanda Harold, the secretary of the Stanthorpe chamber of commerce. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary and very stressful for everyone.\u201d Harold says Stanthorpe faced a similar situation 10 years ago, when the community was months away from running out of water. She, like many locals, thinks authorities should have acted more quickly to build the Emu Swamp dam. The dam tends to split opinion, but most accuse successive councils and governments of failing to plan properly. Rick Humphreys, a small producer, decided not to grow his primary crop \u2013 parsley \u2013 this year. He says there\u2019s an increased acceptance that climate change will force farmers to adapt their practices. \u201cI think people now acknowledge that we\u2019re in uncharted territory,\u201d says Humphreys, who is a member of the group Farmers for Climate Action. \u201cA lot of the old blokes, whose families have been keeping records a long way back, they say this is the worst drought on record \u2026 \u201cIf the numbers are right a version of this is going to become the new normal in the mid-term and we need to think differently about how we produce things and what we produce.

Not one bit.\u201d Walgett, NSW The far western town of Walgett will be back on bore water again next week. Rain in March sent the last natural flow down the once-mighty Barwon River, and the quality of what remains has been declining ever since. On 3 September the shire council warned locals to boil water for drinking and food preparation owing to \u201chigh turbidity\u201d \u2013 a level of murkiness that can indicate the presence of disease-causing bacteria such as E coli. Locals say the water coming out of the tap is brown, brackish and smells bad. \u201cIt\u2019s yucky water,\u201d says Clem Dodd, from the Dhariwaa elders group. \u201cIt stinks. You can\u2019t wash in it or wash your clothes in it, or they\u2019ll stink too.\u201d Walgett shire\u2019s general manager, Greg Ingham, agrees the situation is \u201cpretty dire\u201d. \u201cI really do feel for the community about the river,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to go down and see what was a thriving lifeblood of our community just a dry, parched riverbed.\u201d Walgett\u2019s bore water is high in sodium, which can pose a risk for people with heart disease, diabetes and other chronic health conditions. The water supply is regularly independently tested, and the NSW health department has said it is safe but the taste can be unpalatable. Ingham says the shire is in discussions with the state government to install a desalination system but that in itself will not solve the town\u2019s water woes. \u201cThe output of any desalination treatment won\u2019t be the same as what is currently going through our treatment plant. Desalination on its own won\u2019t be enough to supply all our needs. We might have to look at a blend of the two.\u201d For the past year locals have been buying bottled water or receiving crowdfunded donations shipped in by truck and car.

The only real long-term solution is rain.\u201d The Walgett Aboriginal Medical Service and the Dhariwaa elders group have been distributing bottled water, and delivering water to housebound elders. \u201cBuying water is expensive,\u201d says a local Gamilaraay woman, Vanessa Hickey, \u201chaving to spend extra, to wash fruit and veggies.\u201d Both she and Dodd have started to think about what the lack of water might mean for the future. Dodd says moving away is a possibility but Hickey says she\u2019s not going anywhere. \u201cThey\u2019ve already ruined our rivers with cotton, coal seam gas and mining. But I\u2019m not moving. The community suffers from other people\u2019s wrongdoing. It\u2019s not our fault but we\u2019re the ones who suffer the most. \u201cThey want us gone because they want the land; they want what\u2019s under the land. But where can we live in the city? We only live in the country. I\u2019d rather live in a tent on the riverbank \u2013 only we\u2019ve got no river to live on.\u201d",

House prices jumped 2% in August \u2013 their biggest rise for two years \u2013 and clearance rates are back over 80%. Official figures this week showed that mortgage lending spiked at its fastest rate for four years as buyers raced to take advantage of ultra-low interest rates and more relaxed rules around credit.

      "body": "<p>There was a moment during Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference on Thursday \u2013 the one where he attempted to dissuade journalists and Labor from asking inconvenient questions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/12/scott-morrison-attacks-on-gladys-liu-grubby-undertone\">about the member for Chisholm, Gladys Liu</a> \u2013 when I suddenly visualised Paul Hogan, and smothered a mad impulse to laugh.</p> <p>The prime minister felt that everyone just needed to take a deep breath. The only thing to see here, Morrison soothed from his podium in the Blue Room, was a rookie Liberal MP, a political novice, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/10/liberal-mp-gladys-liu-refuses-to-say-chinas-actions-in-south-china-sea-unlawful\">shouldn\u2019t have gone on the Bolt Report</a>. In case you don\u2019t tune in regularly to Andrew (and shame on you), this was the interview where Liu had declined to criticise Chinese activity in the South China Sea and couldn\u2019t recall whether she was a member China Overseas Exchange Association between 2003 and 2015.</p> <p>\u201cI think the problem here is Gladys Liu has given a clumsy interview,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThat is all that\u2019s happened here.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/13/gladys-liu-accused-of-failing-to-declare-a-40000-donation-to-liberal-party\">Scott Morrison defends Gladys Liu on WeChat but stonewalls further questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reverie was fleeting, but listening to this, I found myself suspended in that scene from Crocodile Dundee where the Paul Hogan character strides from his ramshackle four-wheel drive and subdues a water buffalo intent on charging him. This quasi-mystical incident is explained as <a href=\"https://www.nfsa.gov.au/collection/curated/crocodile-dundee-mind-over-matter\">\u201cmind over matter, an old bushman\u2019s trick,\u201d</a> by the character played by John Meillon, with a big knowing wink to the audience.</p> <p>While Hogan and the animal wranglers on the Dundee set subdued their beast, Morrison had less success. The snorting buffalo of the fourth estate and the non-government forces in the parliament wasn\u2019t hushed, and the questions about Liu kept on coming \u2013 as they should.</p> <p>When the attempted Blue Room hypnosis didn\u2019t have the desired effect, and the day rolled relentlessly through to question time, Morrison then deployed race as a means of trying to turn the bonfire back on his opponents.</p> <p>When the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, pursued questions about Liu in the House, the prime minister thundered: \u201cJust because someone was born in China doesn\u2019t make them disloyal. What the member for Isaacs is doing is casting a smear on Chinese Australians.\u201d Just in case the Chinese community missed the Morrison memo that Labor were grubby smear merchants intent on calumny and crass insult, the prime minister popped up on WeChat with a <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/tJmU7xLZ2Im4xesbLPPSiA\">\u201cstanding up for all Chinese Australians\u201d video</a> by Thursday night.</p> <p>Was it Churchill who counselled never to waste a good crisis? It doesn\u2019t matter, frankly, whether the rapid-fire crisis management was inspired by Churchill, or Morrison\u2019s social media team, or the Liberal party\u2019s federal director, Andrew Hirst \u2013 let\u2019s be very clear here.</p> <p>Nobody had suggested at any point that being Chinese-born meant a person was automatically suspect. The only person who contributed that incendiary thought to the debate was Morrison, when he thought attack was the best form of defence.</p> <p>There was no smear on Chinese Australians. There was a specific question about one member of parliament that went to Morrison\u2019s direct experience and responsibilities. \u201cDid the prime minister receive any advice about the current member for Chisholm from government agencies before or since the 18 May election?\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Morrison declined to answer the question on the basis that responsible prime ministers don\u2019t stand up at the dispatch box and read their Asio briefings into the Hansard. This \u201ccannot be done\u201d, the prime minister informed the chamber, as if explaining an immutable law of physics.</p> <p>Now of course I understand why responsible prime ministers don\u2019t routinely read Asio briefings into the Hansard, but governments are perfectly capable of injecting sensitive material into the public domain that they want to be there. If you are inclined to take issue with this observation, to see it as the caustic raving of a woman who has already confessed to having a daydream about Paul Hogan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/18/top-spy-boss-criticises-the-australian-for-misrepresenting-asio-advice\">just ask the outgoing Asio boss, Duncan Lewis</a>, who was moved to complain to a Senate committee about the practice.</p> <p>Sticking with clarity, let\u2019s be clear, too, about the practical effect of the prime ministerial no comment in response to Dreyfus\u2019s question: we don\u2019t know whether or not agencies have raised issues about Liu.</p> <p>The Herald Sun, which has been pursuing questions about Liu and her connections diligently for weeks, <a href=\"https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/liberal-party-told-of-security-concerns-over-liberal-mps-links-to-the-chinese-communist-party/news-story/e972a5da7fa8d3f4fa16cdc6a7cee3a7\">reported on Thursday</a> that \u201cmen in grey suits\u201d had warned a senior Liberal party official in Victoria that there were concerns about her links to the Chinese Communist party.

      "bodyText": "There was a moment during Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference on Thursday \u2013 the one where he attempted to dissuade journalists and Labor from asking inconvenient questions about the member for Chisholm, Gladys Liu \u2013 when I suddenly visualised Paul Hogan, and smothered a mad impulse to laugh. The prime minister felt that everyone just needed to take a deep breath. The only thing to see here, Morrison soothed from his podium in the Blue Room, was a rookie Liberal MP, a political novice, who shouldn\u2019t have gone on the Bolt Report. In case you don\u2019t tune in regularly to Andrew (and shame on you), this was the interview where Liu had declined to criticise Chinese activity in the South China Sea and couldn\u2019t recall whether she was a member China Overseas Exchange Association between 2003 and 2015. \u201cI think the problem here is Gladys Liu has given a clumsy interview,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThat is all that\u2019s happened here.\u201d The reverie was fleeting, but listening to this, I found myself suspended in that scene from Crocodile Dundee where the Paul Hogan character strides from his ramshackle four-wheel drive and subdues a water buffalo intent on charging him. This quasi-mystical incident is explained as \u201cmind over matter, an old bushman\u2019s trick,\u201d by the character played by John Meillon, with a big knowing wink to the audience. While Hogan and the animal wranglers on the Dundee set subdued their beast, Morrison had less success. The snorting buffalo of the fourth estate and the non-government forces in the parliament wasn\u2019t hushed, and the questions about Liu kept on coming \u2013 as they should. When the attempted Blue Room hypnosis didn\u2019t have the desired effect, and the day rolled relentlessly through to question time, Morrison then deployed race as a means of trying to turn the bonfire back on his opponents. When the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, pursued questions about Liu in the House, the prime minister thundered: \u201cJust because someone was born in China doesn\u2019t make them disloyal. What the member for Isaacs is doing is casting a smear on Chinese Australians.\u201d Just in case the Chinese community missed the Morrison memo that Labor were grubby smear merchants intent on calumny and crass insult, the prime minister popped up on WeChat with a \u201cstanding up for all Chinese Australians\u201d video by Thursday night. Was it Churchill who counselled never to waste a good crisis? It doesn\u2019t matter, frankly, whether the rapid-fire crisis management was inspired by Churchill, or Morrison\u2019s social media team, or the Liberal party\u2019s federal director, Andrew Hirst \u2013 let\u2019s be very clear here. Nobody had suggested at any point that being Chinese-born meant a person was automatically suspect. The only person who contributed that incendiary thought to the debate was Morrison, when he thought attack was the best form of defence. There was no smear on Chinese Australians. There was a specific question about one member of parliament that went to Morrison\u2019s direct experience and responsibilities. \u201cDid the prime minister receive any advice about the current member for Chisholm from government agencies before or since the 18 May election?\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison declined to answer the question on the basis that responsible prime ministers don\u2019t stand up at the dispatch box and read their Asio briefings into the Hansard. This \u201ccannot be done\u201d, the prime minister informed the chamber, as if explaining an immutable law of physics. Now of course I understand why responsible prime ministers don\u2019t routinely read Asio briefings into the Hansard, but governments are perfectly capable of injecting sensitive material into the public domain that they want to be there. If you are inclined to take issue with this observation, to see it as the caustic raving of a woman who has already confessed to having a daydream about Paul Hogan, just ask the outgoing Asio boss, Duncan Lewis, who was moved to complain to a Senate committee about the practice. Sticking with clarity, let\u2019s be clear, too, about the practical effect of the prime ministerial no comment in response to Dreyfus\u2019s question: we don\u2019t know whether or not agencies have raised issues about Liu. The Herald Sun, which has been pursuing questions about Liu and her connections diligently for weeks, reported on Thursday that \u201cmen in grey suits\u201d had warned a senior Liberal party official in Victoria that there were concerns about her links to the Chinese Communist party. The view reported to have been expressed about the preselection by the spooks was: \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you what to do but we don\u2019t think it would be a good idea.\u201d The journalists \u2013 all good reporters with strong track records in news breaking and analysis \u2013 insist three sources validate this account. The former Victorian Liberal president Michael Kroger (who would have overseen Liu\u2019s preselection) says no one raised any security concerns with him. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone from Asio in my life,\u201d Kroger declared on Thursday. It is genuinely difficult to sift provable fact from contention with this story for two reasons. Self-evidently, Asio is not in the habit of confirming or denying its activities \u2013 although it\u2019s fair to note that agencies have been active, when it suits them, in shaping perceptions, both within the political class and with the public, of foreign interference (read Chinese influence activities), which is being presented to the public as nothing short of a new cold war. The second problem in puncturing the \u201che said she said\u201d is the Victorian Liberal party is riven, and hand-to-hand combat and proxy wars between the various self-styled overlords and their squalling understudies and acolytes is not uncommon. The question we ask ourselves as reporters is are these narrators reliable? So pulling back from those complexities, and looking at the sum of the week \u2013 we have been invited by the prime minister to conclude that everything is absolutely hunky dory with Gladys Liu, because of course the Liberal party couldn\u2019t have preselected a person who was the subject of persistent security interest, and of course the prime minister wouldn\u2019t defend such a person if that had occurred. Now forgive my natural scepticism, but a couple of counterfactuals spring naturally to mind. The section 44 debacle shows the preselection vetting processes in all Australian political parties have been much more lax than we thought them to be, particularly in seats where candidates don\u2019t expect to win. Liu, as a prolific fundraiser, and a person who had failed in previous preselection bids in Victoria, might have been owed Chisholm in 2019 (given that\u2019s the way politics works) \u2013 and bear in mind the Liberals did not think they would win that seat in May. Liu only just fell over the line. As well as pointing out the bleeding obvious \u2013 political parties are absolutely capable of preselecting problematic candidates, and declaring everything is fine (remember Malcolm Turnbull, and Barnaby Joyce, and the high court would \u201cso hold\u201d he was eligible) \u2013 Morrison governs in the lower house with a one-seat majority. Again, projecting us into politics as it is rather than some mythological ideal state where everything runs like clockwork and everyone always does the right thing, what choice does a prime minister with a one-seat majority feel he has but to dig in and stoutly defend a member it would be deeply inconvenient to lose? So where do we land after all this? Liu, of course, is absolutely entitled to measured, considered and, dare we say, respectful treatment and a presumption of innocence. But the Australian voting public is also entitled to some straight answers.",

      "body": "<p>On one level it appeared just another week in Australian climate politics. A ridiculous statement by a government minister made headlines; the crossbench <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/11/john-hewson-urges-liberal-conscience-vote-on-climate-emergency-motion\">pushed for stronger action</a>; the prime minister\u2019s office quietly suggested he may not fulfil the next step of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">Paris agreement</a>, a deal he has repeatedly promised voters he would honour.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, much of the media coverage of climate policy focused on what the opposition <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/labor-poised-to-abandon-2030-emissions-reduction-target/news-story/a9c59853715320ba044b8851d9e589e5\">might</a> <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/labor-all-at-sea-on-climate-change-policy-20190912-p52qqx\">do</a> if it wins power in three years\u2019 time.</p> \n<p>But the repercussions from decisions made public this week may reverberate longer than was immediately obvious.</p> \n<p>First, the ridiculous. David Littleproud, the minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, made international news after telling Guardian Australia he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/10/david-littleproud-australian-minister-disaster-climate-change-man-made\">did not know if climate change was manmade</a>. By Thursday, he was saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/12/australian-natural-disasters-ministers-complete-about-face-i-believe-in-climate-science\">he had always accepted the science</a> on the role humans play in the climate changing. He blamed his initial statement on a TV interview being cut short, neglecting to acknowledge it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo/status/1172009184650358784?s=20\">first appeared in an email responding to questions from this publication</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/12/australian-natural-disasters-ministers-complete-about-face-i-believe-in-climate-science\">Australian natural disasters minister's complete about face: 'I believe in climate science'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The minister\u2019s position was backed to varying degrees by cabinet colleagues who played down the need to focus on the link between the climate crisis and bushfires ravaging Queensland and New South Wales or, in the case of the resources minister, Matt Canavan, volunteered that the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/10/david-littleproud-australian-minister-disaster-climate-change-man-made\">supported \u201csensible responses\u201d to the issue</a> that included supporting coal and gas developments.</p> \n<p>If this all sounds wearyingly familiar and anti-science, it is worth noting Littleproud\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/07/move-to-renewables-a-good-thing-says-nationals-agriculture-minister\">past comments</a> back his claim that he more or less accepts mainstream science and the need to respond, if not the urgency scientists say is necessary. Beyond reinforcing Australia\u2019s reputation as a global laggard on the climate emergency, his misstep was extraordinary mostly for illustrating the extent to which relative centrists within the Coalition are tying themselves in knots to avoid the wrath of the hard right.</p> \n<p>But put Littleproud\u2019s gaffe aside. Confirmation by my colleague Katharine Murphy that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/12/scott-morrison-wont-attend-un-climate-summit-despite-being-in-the-us\">Scott Morrison will not attend a climate summit convened by the UN</a> secretary general later this month, despite landing in the US that week to meet Donald Trump, is more significant \u2013 and not just for surface-level appearance reasons.</p> \n<p>Morrison was not offered a speaking slot at the summit because he turned down Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019 call for leaders to come to New York armed with concrete plans to boost national climate commitments next year. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, will attend in his place. While it has received relatively little attention beyond the Guardian, international observers are interpreting it as a sign Australia is backing away from its pledge under the Paris agreement.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s worth looking at what Australia signed up to in France in 2015. The overarching goal agreement is to limit global heating to well below 2C and as close to 1.5C as possible. To get there, countries included a \u201cratchet-up\u201d mechanism. Every five years, they would update their commitments (known, in the UN\u2019s typically alienating language, as \u201cnationally determined contributions\u201d) informed by the latest science.</p> \n<p>Everyone in Paris knew the initial targets set for 2030 were nothing like enough. Everyone knew the success of the pact would depend on countries lifting their commitments sooner rather than later. The point was reinforced last year when the world\u2019s climate scientists, under the banner of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/great-barrier-reef-faces-dire-threat-with-2c-global-warming-un-report-says\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released a major report</a> examining what would be necessary to limit heating to 1.5C.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Signup\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The report, which was requested by leaders in Paris, was stark. As Guterres has noted, it suggests a global 45% cut in emissions is needed by 2030 to keep the 1.5C goal within reach \u2013 a significant ask, but one in which analysts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/11/australia-could-meet-tougher-emissions-target-with-no-extra-economic-pain\">have found Australia could play its part</a>.</p> \n<p>Armed with that information, leaders are now supposed to be doing their part: ramping up what they will do as we approach the first five-yearly update of the Paris agreement next year.</p> \n<p>As one of the world\u2019s 15 biggest emitters and a wealthy developed country, what Australia does is noticed. But in a comment to the Guardian this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/12/scott-morrison-wont-attend-un-climate-summit-despite-being-in-the-us\">Morrison\u2019s office offered nothing to suggest a change was on the cards</a> as promised. \u201cAustralia has already outlined our policies to tackle climate change including cutting our emissions by 26-28% and investing directly into climate resilience projects through our regional partners,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> \n<p>Australia has an infamous history of fudging on its climate targets, dating back to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/27/welcome-to-the-wonderful-world-of-climate-talks-where-less-means-more\">first stage of the Kyoto Protocol</a>, when it demanded a target that allowed it to increase pollution by 8%. It also pushed for the inclusion of land-use changes in its baseline year of 1990, an historically high year for Australian carbon pollution from rampant land clearing in Queensland.</p> \n<p>As land clearing had already reduced in the years that followed, it meant Australia could meet its goal while it continued to dramatically expand fossil fuel operations. It set up a situation where it could claim to be playing its part while doing no such thing.</p> \n<p>That approach has continued. Australia has <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/myths-of-the-australian-climate-change-debate-20150815-gizoe8.html\">changed baseline years to make cuts appear deeper than they are</a> and set targets that ignore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/30/climate-change-abbott-emissions-target\">scientific</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/11/australia-could-meet-tougher-emissions-target-with-no-extra-economic-pain\">advice</a>. Its has set low emissions reduction targets and then wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/australias-kyoto-loophole-eight-times-larger-than-entire-pacific-emissions\">claim extra credit towards its next target</a> for beating the first goal. The credits go to Australia, not the atmosphere.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/12/scott-morrison-wont-attend-un-climate-summit-despite-being-in-the-us\">Scott Morrison won't attend UN climate summit despite being in the US</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As has been well documented, Australia\u2019s national emissions have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/30/australia-carbon-emissions-rise-again-greenhouse-gas-lng\">risen four years straight</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/21/australia-to-miss-2030-emissions-targets-by-vast-margin-coalitions-projections-reveal\">Multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/28/australia-isnt-on-track-to-meet-its-2030-emissions-target-un-report-says\">analyses</a> have found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/02/coalitions-emissions-reduction-fund-labelled-a-joke-after-first-post-election-auction\">existing</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/13/coal-mine-increases-greenhouse-gas-emissions-without-penalty-foi-reveals\">climate change</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/18/questions-raised-over-how-1bn-of-emissions-funding-have-been-allocated\">policies</a> are not enough to meet the current 2030 target.</p> \n<p>It would be foolish to be Pollyannaish about the state of international action to combat climate change. Global emissions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/05/brutal-news-global-carbon-emissions-jump-to-all-time-high-in-2018\">increased last year</a> after plateauing for a couple of years in the middle of the decade. The national governments of the biggest emitters, China and the US, either give mixed messages or are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/26/war-on-science-trump-administration-muzzles-climate-experts-critics-say\">actively opposed to taking action</a>.</p> \n<p>But most major players, China included, remain committed to the Paris process in a way Australia is not. High-level discussions between China and the European Union about increasing their emissions commitments are ongoing. India is watching those talks closely ahead of announcing its position next year. More than 60 countries have signed up to give a presentation at the NYC climate summit, according to an early list seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Amid this, Australia\u2019s plans are unclear at best. It has committed to develop a long-term strategy, but not explained what this will mean. It is possible it could still take an increased 2030 target to the UN climate conference in Glasgow next year. But it has said nothing to indicate this is likely.</p> \n<p>Why does this matter? Beyond it going against Australia\u2019s pledge in 2015, it makes deeper cuts in the future that much harder. Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist with <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/\">Climate Analytics</a>, says it is well established scientifically that inadequate emissions reductions by 2030 leaves little to no chance of reaching zero emissions by 2050, the underlying goal implied by the Paris deal.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/13/queensland-bushfires-firefighters-brace-for-worsening-conditions\">Visiting bushfire-damaged Queensland on Friday</a>, Morrison followed a familiar formula. He accepted that climate change was a factor in what he was witnessing and claimed Australia was acting. \u201cWe have already responded and we will continue to respond, to take action on climate change. I do not accept any suggestion that we do not,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>It is a proven technique: straight denial despite all the evidence running the other way. But talk to international observers of climate efforts and the view is different. Australia is seen as a roadblock, more focused on expanding its coal and gas exports than supporting a global solution. As efforts build ahead of Glasgow next year, Morrison may find it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/18/our-people-are-dying-australias-climate-confrontation-in-the-pacific\">not just the Pacific</a> pushing back.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On one level it appeared just another week in Australian climate politics. A ridiculous statement by a government minister made headlines; the crossbench pushed for stronger action; the prime minister\u2019s office quietly suggested he may not fulfil the next step of the Paris agreement, a deal he has repeatedly promised voters he would honour. Meanwhile, much of the media coverage of climate policy focused on what the opposition might do if it wins power in three years\u2019 time. But the repercussions from decisions made public this week may reverberate longer than was immediately obvious. First, the ridiculous. David Littleproud, the minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, made international news after telling Guardian Australia he did not know if climate change was manmade. By Thursday, he was saying he had always accepted the science on the role humans play in the climate changing. He blamed his initial statement on a TV interview being cut short, neglecting to acknowledge it first appeared in an email responding to questions from this publication. The minister\u2019s position was backed to varying degrees by cabinet colleagues who played down the need to focus on the link between the climate crisis and bushfires ravaging Queensland and New South Wales or, in the case of the resources minister, Matt Canavan, volunteered that the government supported \u201csensible responses\u201d to the issue that included supporting coal and gas developments. If this all sounds wearyingly familiar and anti-science, it is worth noting Littleproud\u2019s past comments back his claim that he more or less accepts mainstream science and the need to respond, if not the urgency scientists say is necessary. Beyond reinforcing Australia\u2019s reputation as a global laggard on the climate emergency, his misstep was extraordinary mostly for illustrating the extent to which relative centrists within the Coalition are tying themselves in knots to avoid the wrath of the hard right. But put Littleproud\u2019s gaffe aside. Confirmation by my colleague Katharine Murphy that Scott Morrison will not attend a climate summit convened by the UN secretary general later this month, despite landing in the US that week to meet Donald Trump, is more significant \u2013 and not just for surface-level appearance reasons. Morrison was not offered a speaking slot at the summit because he turned down Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019 call for leaders to come to New York armed with concrete plans to boost national climate commitments next year. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, will attend in his place. While it has received relatively little attention beyond the Guardian, international observers are interpreting it as a sign Australia is backing away from its pledge under the Paris agreement. It\u2019s worth looking at what Australia signed up to in France in 2015. The overarching goal agreement is to limit global heating to well below 2C and as close to 1.5C as possible. To get there, countries included a \u201cratchet-up\u201d mechanism. Every five years, they would update their commitments (known, in the UN\u2019s typically alienating language, as \u201cnationally determined contributions\u201d) informed by the latest science. Everyone in Paris knew the initial targets set for 2030 were nothing like enough. Everyone knew the success of the pact would depend on countries lifting their commitments sooner rather than later. The point was reinforced last year when the world\u2019s climate scientists, under the banner of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released a major report examining what would be necessary to limit heating to 1.5C. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report, which was requested by leaders in Paris, was stark. As Guterres has noted, it suggests a global 45% cut in emissions is needed by 2030 to keep the 1.5C goal within reach \u2013 a significant ask, but one in which analysts have found Australia could play its part. Armed with that information, leaders are now supposed to be doing their part: ramping up what they will do as we approach the first five-yearly update of the Paris agreement next year. As one of the world\u2019s 15 biggest emitters and a wealthy developed country, what Australia does is noticed. But in a comment to the Guardian this week, Morrison\u2019s office offered nothing to suggest a change was on the cards as promised. \u201cAustralia has already outlined our policies to tackle climate change including cutting our emissions by 26-28% and investing directly into climate resilience projects through our regional partners,\u201d a spokesman said. Australia has an infamous history of fudging on its climate targets, dating back to the first stage of the Kyoto Protocol, when it demanded a target that allowed it to increase pollution by 8%. It also pushed for the inclusion of land-use changes in its baseline year of 1990, an historically high year for Australian carbon pollution from rampant land clearing in Queensland. As land clearing had already reduced in the years that followed, it meant Australia could meet its goal while it continued to dramatically expand fossil fuel operations. It set up a situation where it could claim to be playing its part while doing no such thing. That approach has continued. Australia has changed baseline years to make cuts appear deeper than they are and set targets that ignore scientific advice. Its has set low emissions reduction targets and then wants to claim extra credit towards its next target for beating the first goal. The credits go to Australia, not the atmosphere. As has been well documented, Australia\u2019s national emissions have risen four years straight. Multiple analyses have found existing climate change policies are not enough to meet the current 2030 target. It would be foolish to be Pollyannaish about the state of international action to combat climate change. Global emissions increased last year after plateauing for a couple of years in the middle of the decade. The national governments of the biggest emitters, China and the US, either give mixed messages or are actively opposed to taking action. But most major players, China included, remain committed to the Paris process in a way Australia is not. High-level discussions between China and the European Union about increasing their emissions commitments are ongoing. India is watching those talks closely ahead of announcing its position next year. More than 60 countries have signed up to give a presentation at the NYC climate summit, according to an early list seen by the Guardian. Amid this, Australia\u2019s plans are unclear at best. It has committed to develop a long-term strategy, but not explained what this will mean. It is possible it could still take an increased 2030 target to the UN climate conference in Glasgow next year. But it has said nothing to indicate this is likely. Why does this matter? Beyond it going against Australia\u2019s pledge in 2015, it makes deeper cuts in the future that much harder. Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist with Climate Analytics, says it is well established scientifically that inadequate emissions reductions by 2030 leaves little to no chance of reaching zero emissions by 2050, the underlying goal implied by the Paris deal. Visiting bushfire-damaged Queensland on Friday, Morrison followed a familiar formula. He accepted that climate change was a factor in what he was witnessing and claimed Australia was acting. \u201cWe have already responded and we will continue to respond, to take action on climate change. I do not accept any suggestion that we do not,\u201d he said. It is a proven technique: straight denial despite all the evidence running the other way. But talk to international observers of climate efforts and the view is different. Australia is seen as a roadblock, more focused on expanding its coal and gas exports than supporting a global solution. As efforts build ahead of Glasgow next year, Morrison may find it is not just the Pacific pushing back.",

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter.

Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia.

And the former head of NSW\u2019s urban fire service says early Australian bushfire seasons are here to stay, as he urges the federal government to step in as resources and firefighting assets stretch beyond current capacity. Greg Mullins served as commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW from 2004 until his retirement in 2017 and currently sits on the Climate Council, a national climate change communications body. With NSW bushfires making an early mark in 2019 \u2013 including the destruction of nine homes over the past week in the state\u2019s north \u2013 Mullins says authorities should prepare for more of the same in coming years. He says the entire Australian strategy of tackling bushfires \u2013 sharing firefighting resources between states as the risk moves from northern states in spring to southern states in summer \u2013 is under threat. Climate change has made nights and winters warmer, increasing the possibility extreme bushfires would burn in different states simultaneously. \u201cWhat\u2019s becoming difficult is the whole paradigm of strategic firefighting in Australia \u2013 it was predicated on progressive fire seasons,\u201d he says. \u201cAs we saw last year and now, we\u2019re getting simultaneous fire seasons. \u201cStates are having to resource their own fires while other states are screaming out for help and there\u2019ll be times when each state says, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d Conditions have eased since the strong winds earlier this week fanned more than 130 fires across Queensland and New South Wales, but there are still 70 fires still burning in Queensland and 45 south of the border in NSW. Jonathan How, a forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, told Guardian Australia it would be a very warm weekend across north-east New South Wales and south-east Queensland, and those conditions would extend into next week. \u201cThe main reason we are seeing these very warm conditions is we have a very stubborn high pressure system sitting over the centre of the continent and so that is basically preventing any cooler conditions from making it any further north.\u201d He said there would be clear skies and temperatures between 6C and 10C above average for this time of year on the weekend, and up to 12C above average next week. Most of the fire sites would experience temperatures in the high 20s and low 30s, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to lead to high to very high fire dangers, which will keep conditions quite challenging for fighting the fires. \u201cThe one saviour for the firefighters is the winds aren\u2019t as strong as what we saw last week.\u201d But winds could pick up later in the week when a cold front comes through on Thursday.

The above-average spring temperatures are likely to continue over spring. Bom researchers reported last week in the Conversation that there could be months of above-average temperatures and below-average rainfall in large parts of NSW and Queensland as a result of record warm temperatures above Antarctica. The Actuaries Institute\u2019s quarterly climate index released this week also showed autumn 2019 ranked as the second-highest for extreme temperatures since the index started in 1981.

Unable to legally work, they are told by the UNHCR, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, that there is no money to support them. Resettlement could be decades away, if it happens at all.

At the beginning, a small girl says she wants to win the Melbourne Cup.

That there were women riding at all came as a surprise. \u201cI just thought it was so ironic that the only sport in the world where women compete with men is the most dangerous sport in the world,\u201d she says. As she saw Payne lean down to hug her brother Stevie and found out about Paddy Payne and the many siblings (in tragic circumstances, her sister Brigid died after a fall), Griffiths saw in this story a classic Australian sporting film \u2013 the prize, the obstacles, the win \u2013 with a woman at its centre. </p> <p>\u201cAfter she told the world to \u2018get stuffed\u2019 I thought, that\u2019s the girl Australia\u2019s going to root for because she\u2019s the outsider, she\u2019s 100 to 1.\u201d (Stevie, strapper for the horse, appears in the film as himself and is a standout, delivering all the best lines.)</p> <p>But the making of the film didn\u2019t always come easy, she says, acknowledging there were \u201cdark nights of the soul\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I had some really hard times on the film, where I asked myself, \u2018Can I really do this? Shouldn\u2019t someone else be doing it? \u2026 Should someone else be on the horse?\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI was definitely inspired by Michelle\u2019s persistence, her resilience, her determination, her focus, her passion. It was those things that kept me going.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73d32db410892aeae1bd7e2614829031f0c4312a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73d32db410892aeae1bd7e2614829031f0c4312a/0_0_2300_1535/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teresa Palmer and Stevie Payne in Ride Like A Girl\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stevie Payne, Michelle\u2019s brother and her horse\u2019s strapper, plays himself in the film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Transmission Film</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Griffiths has been a strong campaigner for gender equality in film and television. She launched Create NSW\u2019s #SheDirects development initiative that aims to boost the numbers of women in director positions for television, and Ride Like a Girl is the first film produced under Screen Australia\u2019s Gender Matters program. She believes these quota ambitions are making a big difference.</p> <p>\u201cI love the idea that women stand on the shoulders of our sisters \u2026 as we move into professional areas that have been dominated by men,\u201d she says. While Australia hasn\u2019t traditionally made large-scale films based around women as heroes, Griffiths sees things changing with another biopic, I Am Woman, based on Helen Reddy\u2019s life story, soon to be released.</p> <p>Griffiths didn\u2019t set out to make a \u201cchick flick\u201d, as she puts it, but she sees similarities between Payne\u2019s journey and her own, recognising both their mutual ambition and desire to promote others in their industries. \u201cMichelle grew up seeing her sister, Therese, win the Bendigo Cup. Cathy had a lot of city wins. Brigid was the second woman to ride professionally in the state.\u201d Like Payne, Griffiths is the youngest child in her family and she understands that dynamic too. \u201cThe last child\u2019s always chasing the oldest.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Ride Like a Girl is in Australian cinemas from 26 September</em></p>",

Griffiths has said in an ABC interview that she thinks it\u2019s unfair the controversy over the ethics of the industry has drawn attention away from Payne\u2019s achievements. \u201cThis extraordinary film celebrates 15 years of a woman\u2019s determination and resilience to realise her dream,\u201d she said. \u201cI just hope that the conversation is not dragged back to some other man\u2019s behaviour.\u201d She seems relieved the film went down well with its subject; she always saw Payne and her family as the key stakeholders. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a hagiography, and paint her into the saint,\u201d Griffiths says of Payne. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t think of anything worse than having a film made about me or my family.\u201d She cast Palmer to play the main role, trying to reconcile this \u201cmind-splitting dichotomy\u201d between young and dutiful, and stubborn and tenacious. \u201cMichelle spent many years probably being underestimated, and I think Teresa Palmer could relate to that,\u201d Griffiths says. \u201cAs a beautiful actress she\u2019s often cast to enhance the male journey; she follows picking up crumbs, making the best of them.\u201d The film begins and ends with documentary footage. At the beginning, a small girl says she wants to win the Melbourne Cup. By the end she is crossing the finish line, victorious, making a speech about women\u2019s rights in a man\u2019s world \u2013 and telling all the detractors to \u201cget stuffed\u201d. It was a speech that struck a nerve at the time, but it resonated with many women. \u201cRacing is a sport of kings \u2013 and there\u2019s a great photo of me [on Cup day] cantering past [a billboard] that says, \u2018Who will be king?\u2019 \u201d Payne says. \u201cWomen just were so happy to see that anything is possible if you really are determined and you believe in yourself and stick up for yourself.\u201d That speech came out impromptu, she says; it was the first thing that crossed her mind as she slowed down on Prince. \u201cIt just became so apparent to me that it was so much more than just me winning the race.\u201d Watching the race at a Cup day barbecue, this was the speech that inspired Griffiths to make the film. That there were women riding at all came as a surprise. \u201cI just thought it was so ironic that the only sport in the world where women compete with men is the most dangerous sport in the world,\u201d she says. As she saw Payne lean down to hug her brother Stevie and found out about Paddy Payne and the many siblings (in tragic circumstances, her sister Brigid died after a fall), Griffiths saw in this story a classic Australian sporting film \u2013 the prize, the obstacles, the win \u2013 with a woman at its centre. \u201cAfter she told the world to \u2018get stuffed\u2019 I thought, that\u2019s the girl Australia\u2019s going to root for because she\u2019s the outsider, she\u2019s 100 to 1.\u201d (Stevie, strapper for the horse, appears in the film as himself and is a standout, delivering all the best lines.) But the making of the film didn\u2019t always come easy, she says, acknowledging there were \u201cdark nights of the soul\u201d. \u201cLook, I had some really hard times on the film, where I asked myself, \u2018Can I really do this? Shouldn\u2019t someone else be doing it? \u2026 Should someone else be on the horse?\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI was definitely inspired by Michelle\u2019s persistence, her resilience, her determination, her focus, her passion. It was those things that kept me going.\u201d Griffiths has been a strong campaigner for gender equality in film and television. She launched Create NSW\u2019s #SheDirects development initiative that aims to boost the numbers of women in director positions for television, and Ride Like a Girl is the first film produced under Screen Australia\u2019s Gender Matters program. She believes these quota ambitions are making a big difference. \u201cI love the idea that women stand on the shoulders of our sisters \u2026 as we move into professional areas that have been dominated by men,\u201d she says. While Australia hasn\u2019t traditionally made large-scale films based around women as heroes, Griffiths sees things changing with another biopic, I Am Woman, based on Helen Reddy\u2019s life story, soon to be released. Griffiths didn\u2019t set out to make a \u201cchick flick\u201d, as she puts it, but she sees similarities between Payne\u2019s journey and her own, recognising both their mutual ambition and desire to promote others in their industries. \u201cMichelle grew up seeing her sister, Therese, win the Bendigo Cup. Cathy had a lot of city wins. Brigid was the second woman to ride professionally in the state.\u201d Like Payne, Griffiths is the youngest child in her family and she understands that dynamic too. \u201cThe last child\u2019s always chasing the oldest.\u201d \u2022 Ride Like a Girl is in Australian cinemas from 26 September",

In total he has batted just shy of 31 hours this series and now has 10 consecutive scores of 50 or more against English bowlers in Test cricket \u2013 a record by any batsman against one opponent.</p> \n<p>Indeed the wicket conjured up by Woakes could almost be considered the first time England have truly got the 30-year-old out this summer.

      "bodyText": "Jofra Archer had a feeling something was not right with Steve Smith on day two at the Oval. And at the close of play, after the lowest score of what has been astonishing Ashes series from the right-handed run machine, the mystery was solved. Smith, who finally missed a straight one to fall leg-before to Chris Woakes for 80 in the evening session, revealed that he had been dosed up on cold remedies all day. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling a little bit. I\u2019ve got a little bit of the flu,\u201d he said. Archer, fresh from his second six-wicket haul in only his fourth Test match for England, had noted a difference in how Smith looked at the crease, saying: \u201cIt might just be my perception of it but he didn\u2019t look as nailed on as he usually is.\u201d When Smith\u2019s bout of the sniffles was then put to him, the fast bowler replied: \u201cI knew there was something!\u201d The pair have been locked in an absorbing duel this summer, one which Smith can claim to have had the better of ever since bouncing back from the concussion suffered at Lord\u2019s when struck on the neck by a 92mph Archer short-ball. Having missed the defeat in Headingley due to the after-effects of that blow, Smith has responded with 373 runs in three innings. In total he has batted just shy of 31 hours this series and now has 10 consecutive scores of 50 or more against English bowlers in Test cricket \u2013 a record by any batsman against one opponent. Indeed the wicket conjured up by Woakes could almost be considered the first time England have truly got the 30-year-old out this summer. Smith\u2019s five previous dismissals came when either chasing fast runs or the lbw at Lord\u2019s, padding up to Woakes on 92, while still dazed from Archer\u2019s thunderbolt. Archer said: \u201cIt\u2019s weird, you know. Every time he bats, I don\u2019t know what it is. He literally cannot get out. If he plays a bad shot, the ball lands in no man\u2019s and. For the whole series. Obviously he\u2019s a good batter, he\u2019s got a good temperament, but I don\u2019t know what it is: the ball never ever goes to hand. \u201cWe know he\u2019s going to miss one, though, and today just proves it. Funnily enough, the last person he missed one off was Woakes [at Lord\u2019s].\u201d As was the case following his six for 45 at Headingley, Archer was mostly relieved to be off the field. And then doubly so when Rory Burns, whose stunning catch to remove Peter Siddle at gully wrapped up the innings, overturned an lbw decision off the last ball of the day to see England head into day three with a lead of 78 runs and 10 wickets in hand. On the Burns catch, Archer added: \u201cWhen I saw him hit the ball, I thought it was four. It was a special catch. I don\u2019t think you should underestimate how good the catch is, especially given the position it\u2019s put us in. Although the Ashes are lost, we\u2019ve still got a lot to play for \u2013 the World Test Championship and our own games. It would mean a lot for the team to win here.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Readjusting to being a former prime minister can\u2019t be easy. Tony Blair described having to learn to use a mobile phone, after years when aides took charge of all his communications. Theresa May was to be seen earlier this week pottering about in the palace of Westminster, not a flunky in sight, buying herself lunch. But the sense from David Cameron\u2019s Times interview is that the hardest readjustment has been getting used to the idea of not always being a winner. Cameron once reportedly said he wanted to be prime minister, because \u201cI think I\u2019d be good at it\u201d; and when he unexpectedly secured a majority at the 2015 general election, he and George Osborne saw it as confirmation of their political genius. They were indeed clever, and ruthless \u2013 but not ruthless enough, it turned out, when it came to the brutal 2016 referendum campaign, the outcome of which Cameron says made him \u201cdepressed\u201d. Much of his fury is directed at Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, his erstwhile political and personal friends, whom he accuses of behaving \u201cappallingly\u201d. Ironically, had Cameron\u2019s memoir been published several months ago when it was originally due to appear, these character notes on his old rivals would have seemed of little more than historical interest. But he has burst out of his shepherd\u2019s hut just as the Vote Leave crew are back together in Downing Street, and applying the same battering-ram approach to parliament, the judiciary and anyone else who stands in their way, as they did to the Stronger In campaigners in 2016. And the \u201cTory psychodrama\u201d that he claims prevented the remainers\u2019 message from getting through has become a full-scale civil war, that could yet rend his old party in two. Yet what Dave doesn\u2019t really seem to feel, is a heavy weight of personal responsibility. Osborne apparently still chides him, \u201cyou and your fucking referendum\u201d. But Cameron still believes it was necessary and all but inevitable because of the pressures inside his own party and out in the country at large; and that his EU renegotiation was a grand idea that could have been a \u201cboon\u201d for Britain if the leavers\u2019 dastardly tactics hadn\u2019t stopped him from getting his message across to the great British public. And his analysis of the great rupture of Brexit appears to be that its causes lie more in the political swordsmanship of that brief campaign in the summer of 2016, than in the years of public sector austerity, industrial decline and anti-immigrant rhetoric that preceded it. It\u2019s much too soon to say, of course \u2013 but history may well judge otherwise.",

Having said that, I can\u2019t help but wonder what his numbers would be like if he had played 10-20 years ago. I grew up watching and falling in love with cricket when players like Wasim, Waqar, Kumble Pollock, Murali, Warne, McGrath, Steyn (peak), Shane Bond, Akhtar, Lee etc and even though I am not slating the bowlers we have today in any way, I just think those guys were on a different level. Which is why, even though numbers would suggest Smith is second only to Bradman, for me at least, players like Ponting, Kallis, Lara, Sachin, Inzamam, Sangakkara will always rank higher.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d have said the same around 2015, when most English people were Steve Smith deniers. But two things have changed since then \u2013 there\u2019s been a renaissance in fast bowling, and pitches have become much tougher for batting. This series in particular has convinced me that he would have got runs even in the mid-1990s, which I think was a golden age of fast bowling. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7bb1eb8f08f9df5bdd3e72\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-13T15:16:20.247Z\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>47th over: Australia 156-4 (Smith 62, Marsh 17) </strong>A bit of extra bounce from Archer surprises Marsh, who does well to drop it short of the slip cordon.

For some reason I rate him more than Bairstow as a Test cricketer even though he has an inferior average (32 to 35) and fewer hundreds (1 to 6). I have a feeling it\u2019s because he looks much better in defence, allied to the fact that Bairstow gets bowled way too much. In terms of averages though, both of them would be about par for wicketkeeper batsmen. I think it was Geoff Lemon who wrote that our idea of what wicketkeepers can manage has been warped by Gilchrist (and to a lesser extent Sangakkara and ABdV, who stopped keeping to help their batting). Anyway, to the point. My 5, 6, 7 moving forward would be Pope, Buttler, Foakes (don\u2019t ask me where stokes goes, 3?). Mainly because I feel YJB needs to be dropped and I just have a feeling that Jos might yet become our ABdV. What do you reckon?\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s a tough one to answer pithily, but here\u2019s my take. I like the idea of Jos Buttler. I think his ceiling as a Test cricketer is high, if only he can find consistent form and a clearly defined role. But I think it\u2019s time he\u2019s picked as a top-six batsman or not at all. He\u2019s 29 and been around Test cricket for five years now without returning the sort of numbers to demand reselection. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7b5ac28f08143ee1ae5878\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-13T09:02:17.260Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83f04147918dcf04d8537e393e38f01a923368c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83f04147918dcf04d8537e393e38f01a923368c3/0_0_3500_2221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Oval\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Oval looks in mint condition on the final Friday of the Ashes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7b58d48f083106f455ad61\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-13T08:57:36.166Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Apologies, I\u2019ve logged on in a bit of a grumpy mood (any suggestions for shaking it, gratefully accepted) but it means I can\u2019t overlook that yesterday - a fine and dry day of Test cricket - featured just 82 overs.

The game is unfolding on Australia\u2019s terms after a solid but far from flawless display in the field proved enough to expose England\u2019s frailties with the bat. Rory Burns once again made a decent start, and once again Joe Root chipped in, but neither made the Smithian contribution demanded of them, leaving the scoreboard on the dreary side once the all-too common collapse occurred. Some early evening biff from Jos Buttler put some smiles on some faces but it served only to remind England followers what they were missing when the Ashes were still there to be won. </p> <p>Frustratingly, considering the state of the series, little new was gleaned from yesterday\u2019s action to add to the planning for future contests. The dismissals of Joe Denly and Jonny Bairstow in particular were agonisingly predictable.</p> <p>Australia can take heart from Mitch Marsh\u2019s show stealing performance with the ball. They can now look forward to almost three full days during which Steve Smith has the freedom to play merry hell with all sorts of records. </p> <p>I\u2019m around for the next hour or so to keep this show on the road, but when play begins Geoff Lemon will step into the breach.

Thanks for your company - night! And Barney Ronay on Sam Curran and Steve Smith \u2026 Here\u2019s Sam Curran \u201cThat wicket is pretty placid, so to bowl them out for 225 is a great effort. The ball swung more as the day went on, and I\u2019ve been trying to swing it more consistently back into the right-handers \u2013 I\u2019ve been working on my wrist position and a few things on the ball with my fingers. Trying to bowl more maidens is another way I\u2019d like to improve. \u201cIt was really enjoyable bowling at the best batsman in the world. We\u2019ve tried a lot of things but he\u2019s been incredible. Hopefully he doesn\u2019t get any in the second innings! I\u2019ll be honest, the ball that got Matthew Wade was natural variation. If I don\u2019t know, the batter\u2019s not gonna know! I probably bowled a little too full for the hat-trick balls. But yeah, good fun. \u201cI\u2019d like to get a little bit quicker. Hopefully it comes naturally and with a bit of hard work. With the schedule it\u2019s not easy to work on different things. At the moment I\u2019m trying to be as consistent as I can \u2013 look at Jimmy, or Cummins and Hazlewood. I do get a bit excited now and again when I\u2019m swinging the ball into the pads, but I\u2019m slowly getting better.\u201d That was another flawed and highly entertaining day\u2019s cricket. Steve Smith made his lowest score of the series, 80, while Jofra Archer bowled masterfully to take his second six-for of the series. Sam Curran (3 for 46) and Marnus Labuschagne (48) also had good days. England will return tomorrow as clear favourites to win the match, although they\u2019ll want plenty of insurance against a matchwinning epic from Smith. That\u2019s the one thing he hasn\u2019t achieved in the Ashes - his highest score in the fourth innings is 33, and he has never batted in a successful run-chase against England. Yet. Before he gets to bat, Australia\u2019s champions, Cummins and Hazlewood, will go to the well one last time in an attempt to turn an Ashes retention into an Ashes victory. 4th over: England 9-0 (Burns 4, Denly 1) That was quite an eventful final over. Denly was dropped off the third delivery, an ostensibly simple chance to Harris in the gully. But he lost sight of the ball and it split the webbing on his hand. Funnily enough, Gary Naylor emailed 15 minutes ago to say it was becoming very difficult to sight the ball because of the low setting sun. Naylor knows. Burns is not out! It pitched miles outside leg, and that\u2019s an unusually poor decision from Kumar Dharmasena. That\u2019s stumps: England lead by 78. Burns is given out LBW to the last ball of the day - but he\u2019s reviewed it! I think this pitched outside leg. 3rd over: England 4-0 (Burns 0, Denly 0) Burns does well to defend a full inswinger from Cummins, whose last ball of the day is another nasty bouncer. Burns ducks under it and then smiles, knowing he shouldn\u2019t have to face any more deliveries today. 2nd over: England 4-0 (Burns 0, Denly 0) Joe Denly, who drove back to the ground from Whitstable this afternoon following the birth of his second child, faces up to Hazlewood. The third ball zips past the edge, but the rest of the over is defended solidly. Two more overs for England to survive. 1st over: England 4-0 (Burns 0, Denly 0) Cummins ends a blistering first over by ripping one past Burns\u2019 outside edge. Burns has surely earned the respect of the Aussie pace attack this series; whatever the era, that must feel so good for an opening batsman. 0.3 overs: England 4-0 (Burns 0, Denly 0) Pat Cummins, who looks justifiably radged off at having to bowl tonight, starts the innings with a ferocious assault on Rory Burns. His second ball hits the shoulder and flies for four leg-byes; the next delivery hits the glove and deflects onto the grille, which means a break in play while Burns is assessed. He seems okay. Jofra Archer\u2019s debut Test series: 4 Tests, 22 wickets at an average of 17.27. I\u2019m pretty sure that no England bowler since the war has taken as many wickets against Australia in what was also their first Test series, although Frank Tyson had only played one Test before he obliterated Australia in 1954-55. England lead by 69, which is a decent bit of Steve Smith insurance for the fourth innings. They have around 20 minutes to bat tonight. Siddle steered Archer low to the right of gully, where Burns plunged to take a stunning one-handed catch. It was very similar to that legendary Stokes catch at Trent Bridge in 2015, although the ball wasn\u2019t quite as far behind Burns. It was still a truly great catch \u2013 and it gives Jofra Archer the second six-for of his short Test career: 23.5-9-62-6. He is the gift that will keep on giving for the next decade. I have no idea what we\u2019ve done to deserve him. What a catch from Rory Burns! This is right up there with Ben Stokes\u2019 brab to dismiss Adam Voges four years ago. Five wickets for Jofra Archer! Lyon is cleaned up by a brilliant slower yorker that thuds into the base of off stump. That\u2019s Archer\u2019s second five-for in four Tests. He is a glorious cricketer. 68th over: Australia 224-8 (Siddle 18, Lyon 25) Jack Leach comes into the attack, an interesting gamble given Lyon\u2019s aggressive approach. His first over is pretty quiet - three singles, all swept. \u201cWoakes should be given credit for the disguise he put on that ball to Smith,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cHe offered an innocuous-looking delivery that was in fact so innocuous it was nocuous.\u201d 67th over: Australia 221-8 (Siddle 17, Lyon 23) Lyon makes room to blast Archer over cover for four more - and then he\u2019s dropped by Leach at fine leg! Oh dear, that was a pretty straightforward chance after Lyon top-edged a hook. In fact, Leach took a nice low catch but lost control of the ball when his arms hit the ground. 66th over: Australia 215-8 (Siddle 16, Lyon 18) England lead by 89, which is plenty on a wearing pitch. But if Australia can reduce that to 40 or 50, a few England players might start to recall the unwelcome precedent of Melbourne 2013. Lyon adds four more, wafting Woakes breezily over mid-off, and then pings a short-arm pull for six! Haha, that was a sensational shot. \u201cThis is so, SO excellent, Rob,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cI will fight anyone that says Test cricket is not the finest sport in all of humanity. And I have no idea who\u2019ll win this Test match. Though it would be so England to be facing 340-9 at lunch tomorrow.\u201d 65th over: Australia 205-8 (Siddle 16, Lyon 8) Siddle, who is an excellent No9, waves Archer confidently through the covers for four more. This is Archer\u2019s 22nd over of the day, although his pace is still good - the follow-up bouncer is clocked at 86.5mph. \u201cSo now we know Smith\u2019s weak spot,\u201d says Derek Walmsley. \u201cBowl over 1100 deliveries at him, and then watch his concentration go to pieces.\u201d If only this was a 15-Test series. He\u2019s shot to bits. 64th over: Australia 201-8 (Siddle 12, Lyon 8) So, we could be heading for the first drawn Ashes since 1972. That\u2019s such an unlikely statistic - no drawn series in almost 50 years. Yep, I can count. \u201cAre these the worst batting stats, ever, for two teams in an Ashes series?\u201d asks John Jones. \u201cWoeful.\u201d They aren\u2019t even close. In the 19th century, 150 was usually a good score. In fact in the 1888 series, the average runs per wicket was 11.11. The average this year, 29.81, is the lowest in an Ashes series since 1998-99. 63rd over: Australia 198-8 (Siddle 9, Lyon 8) Jofra Archer returns, hunting the second five-for of his short Test career. Siddle thumps a full delivery through extra cover for three, and that\u2019s your lot. 62nd over: Australia 195-8 (Siddle 6, Lyon 8) Woakes, you could argue, is the only England bowler who has got Smith out in this series - once at Edgbaston and once today. The other dismissals were all when Smith was hitting out in pursuit of quick runs. The new batsman Lyon gets some quick runs of his own, twice thick-edging Woakes for four. \u201cRob, you said that Curran might not be in if Stokes was fully fit,\u201d says Adam Roberts. \u201cBut what was the thinking for the 4th Test? As I asked during the OT Test, \u2018What does Overton bring to this team that others such as Curran (or Woakes) don\u2019t?\u2019 OK, Overton did well as a batsman but Curran is a proven performer with bat and ball.\u201d I assume they thought that pitch would offer more bounce, as Old Trafford often does. If so, they misread it, but I understand the logic. Breaking news: Steve Smith is out. Where\u2019s Walter Cronkite when you need him? Smith walked across his stumps to the new bowler Woakes, missed the usual flick to leg and was plumb LBW. He didn\u2019t even bother to review. It\u2019s often said that you can\u2019t bowl straight to Smith, but he does get out LBW a fair bit. He also flicks millions of deliveries for four, so there\u2019s that. Yep. 61st over: Australia 187-7 (Smith 80, Siddle 6) Leach continues with a maiden to Siddle. 60th over: Australia 187-7 (Smith 80, Siddle 6) Curran moves around the wicket to Siddle, immediately slipping one past the outside edge, and them moves back over to beat Smith with a short ball. That\u2019s drinks. Meantime, I love this stat. Steve Smith\u2019s lowest score of the series is 80 not out. Only three players - Stokes, Burns and Wade - have a highest score in excess of 80. \u201cInteresting,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cVery interesting.\u201d I\u2019ve been wondering about this all series. If the regulations are adhered to, both sides should end the series with 0 points. Am I wrong? 59th over: Australia 185-7 (Smith 79, Siddle 5) Jack Leach replaces Jofra Archer, who has figures of 20-9-48-4. Smith shows all three stumps and takes a delivery right off middle stump, like the bohemian genius he is. He has moved stealthily to within 21 of another hundred. 58th over: Australia 182-7 (Smith 76, Siddle 5) If England do rip it up and start again, Curran and Pope are the kind of young players they should invest in. Curran\u2019s big-match temperament is so impressive, and he almost picks up a fourth wicket when Siddle survives a couple of LBW appeals after playing around the inswinger. Both were missing leg. \u201cSages were writing Curran off as being destined to be a batsman who bowls last season, but I saw that the hat-trick ball was up at 88mph and he seems to have increased his pace compared to last year,\u201d says Tom Bowtell. \u201cIf he can get up regularly to 85 and keep the swing, he could be quite the player.\u201d I suspect the length of his Test career will be determined by his ability to Chamindavaas wickets when the ball isn\u2019t swinging. When it does swing, he\u2019s a big threat, but when you pick an XI you can\u2019t be sure whether the ball will swing. 57th over: Australia 182-7 (Smith 76, Siddle 5) Smith is beaten by Archer, swishing outside off stump with fast hands. The next ball is short, forcing Smith to bend his back to get out of the way. This is a terrific contest - not quite as good at Lord\u2019s, but still a fascinating struggle between a supernatural genius and a future all-time great. 56th over: Australia 179-7 (Smith 75, Siddle 4) \u201cWonder if perhaps it was a huge mistake to not pick Curran for the first four Tests,\u201d says Abdul Basit. \u201cCould have added vital runs that might have saved the last Test, could have maybe taken much needed wickets. It was always a bizarre decision to drop him, and maybe Root missed a trick.\u201d I don\u2019t think they know his role, and he might not have played here had Ben Stokes been fit to bowl. I suspect they were burned by those Tests in the West Indies as well. He\u2019s such an exciting player, though; with the possible exception of Jack Crawford, no England allrounder has had as big an impact at such a young age. 55th over: Australia 179-7 (Smith 75, Siddle 4) Smith cuts Archer for four, another emphatic stroke, before slicing a less deliberate boundary between second and fourth slip. Archer has bowled beautifully at Smith today - but he still hasn\u2019t dismissed him in this series. Their battle has been a bit like Anderson v Kohli last summer. 54th over: Australia 170-7 (Smith 66, Siddle 4) Siddle edges the hat-trick ball - an attempted yorker that turned into a low full toss - all along the ground for four. We talk a lot, probably too much, about what Sam Curran can\u2019t do; we should focus more on his priceless ability to make decisive contributions with bat and ball. That was a classic left-armer\u2019s dismissal, a big inswinger that trapped Cummins in front as he pushed around his front pad. It was actually Steve Smith who encouraged Cummins to review, thinking it was missing leg. In fact it was hitting middle and leg, so Australia lose a review. More importantly, Sam Curran is on a hat-trick! What an awful review. I assumed he must have inside-edged it, because it was absolutely plumb. Cummins goes first ball - but he\u2019s reviewed it! Well bowled Sam Curran! Paine tries to drive a tempting, full-length delivery that moves away a fraction to take the edge, and Bairstow does the rest. Curran has quietly had an excellent day. 53rd over: Australia 166-5 (Smith 66, Paine 1) Smith gets a leading edge off Archer that lands safely on the off side. He\u2019s had a fair bit of luck today, at least by his standards. The next ball whistles just past both the outside edge and the off stump; Smith nods in appreciation. A maiden. Both players look like they are building towards another mighty head-to-head contest. 52nd over: Australia 166-5 (Smith 66, Paine 1) A fine maiden from Curran to Paine. He has an LBW shout turned down - missing leg - and then slips one past the outside edge. \u201cA \u2018renaissance in fast bowling\u2019,\u201d sniffs Mark Dawson. \u201cReally? The Aussies have a couple, which doesn\u2019t help much when it comes to assessing Smith\u2019s status. India now have one, who\u2019s probably the best quick Indian bowler ever but hardly Holdingesque. England have Anderson and Broad, both excellent but I\u2019d suggest also not in the McGrath/Marshall class. Archer might be, and quite soon. Time always lends lustre, but I\u2019m with Neil Thapa: today\u2019s bowlers aren\u2019t on the same level as those faced by Border, Ponting and Waugh. Which is not to disparage Smith: you can only beat, dispirit, and humiliate what\u2019s in front of you.\u201d India have a lot more than one, I would say, and South Africa had a very good attack when Smith faced them. He also averages around 100 against 90+mph deliveries. I was referring as much to the moving ball, which was previously his weakness. 51st over: Australia 166-5 (Smith 66, Paine 1) A bouncer from Archer to Smith beats everyone and goes for four wides. I missed much of that over as I was getting my hands dirty on Statsguru. Steve Smith\u2019s current series average is 147.40, the highest in Ashes history (min: three innings). He\u2019s fourth on the list as well. 50th over: Australia 160-5 (Smith 66, Paine 0) You couldn\u2019t make it up department: Steve Smith has been dropped by Joe Root! He flapped at a wide bouncer from Curran - it might have been a slower one - and edged it towards the slip. Root and Stokes both leapt towards the ball, and it hit Root\u2019s right palm before falling to the ground. 49th over: Australia 160-5 (Smith 66, Paine 0) Tim Paine survives a huge LBW shout first ball. It was sliding down, I think, and there might have been an inside edge as well. Still, it\u2019s a wicket maiden from Archer, who now has 20 wickets at 17.45 in his debut Test series. \u201cI should have got Brian Bolus as he was a Notts man at one time,\u201d says John Starbuck of Robert Smithson\u2019s list. \u201cNice to see Slasher Mackay in the list though; his reputation disguised how dogged he must have been.\u201d Slasher Mackay and Trevor Bailey is the great lost T20 partnership. Four wickets for Jofra Archer. Marsh has been suckered out by the short ball. He jumped across his crease and pulled flat and hard to fine leg, where Leach crouched to take a comfortable catch. 48th over: Australia 160-4 (Smith 66, Marsh 17) Broad tries something different to unsettle Smith by bowling a delivery from behind the stumps. Four runs. It turned into a half-volley and Smith laced it through extra cover. \u201cI have an opinion on all this Steve Smith brouhaha,\u201d says Neil Thapa. \u201cMake no mistake he\u2019s a great batsman and will go down as one of the greatest of all time. Having said that, I can\u2019t help but wonder what his numbers would be like if he had played 10-20 years ago. I grew up watching and falling in love with cricket when players like Wasim, Waqar, Kumble Pollock, Murali, Warne, McGrath, Steyn (peak), Shane Bond, Akhtar, Lee etc and even though I am not slating the bowlers we have today in any way, I just think those guys were on a different level. Which is why, even though numbers would suggest Smith is second only to Bradman, for me at least, players like Ponting, Kallis, Lara, Sachin, Inzamam, Sangakkara will always rank higher.\u201d I\u2019d have said the same around 2015, when most English people were Steve Smith deniers. But two things have changed since then \u2013 there\u2019s been a renaissance in fast bowling, and pitches have become much tougher for batting. This series in particular has convinced me that he would have got runs even in the mid-1990s, which I think was a golden age of fast bowling. 47th over: Australia 156-4 (Smith 62, Marsh 17) A bit of extra bounce from Archer surprises Marsh, who does well to drop it short of the slip cordon. A maiden. Archer has been superb today: 15-7-31-3. The rest have combined figures of 32-7-123-1. 46th over: Australia 156-4 (Smith 62, Marsh 17) Stylish stuff from Marsh, who drives Broad through cover point for four. Broad hasn\u2019t been at his best today; perhaps the tight schedule has caught up with him, or maybe he needs the Ashes to be on the line to produce his best. \u201cPretty sure I\u2019m not the only one who hopes Marsh gets a few,\u201d says Gervase Greene. \u201cNot because he\u2019s a very good player - though he is - but because of the unfair weight placed on his shoulders every time he\u2019s taken block. The trouble with being a family guy, I guess. But I like him for the fact he has never, ever let any dissatisfaction or sense of grievance ever infect his game. Or a press conference post-mortem. Or anything. Quite a feat, really. For that alone, but more, I rate him.\u201d Indeed. It\u2019s a pretty admirable trait, especially at a time when most of us are picking fights with our own shadow on the internet. 45th over: Australia 148-4 (Smith 60, Marsh 12) Jofra Archer returns to the attack after tea. The wicket of Steve Smith would top off a spectacular debut Test series, surely the best by an England bowler since Dominic Cork in 1995. A good bouncer has Smith falling over to the off side, as he did when he was struck at Lord\u2019s; this time is goes safely over his shoulder. Smith hooks loosely later in the over, too, but the ball lands well short of deep backward square. In other news, nobody was able to get Robert Smithson\u2019s teaser in the 37th over. Here\u2019s the answer. \u201cNext plan should be mental disintegration of Smith by exposure to Pythonesque sledging,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cElderberries and all that.\u201d 44th over: Australia 147-4 (Smith 59, Marsh 12) A poor ball from Broad is cut easily for four by Marsh, and that\u2019s tea. It was another intriguing session: 25 overs, 92 runs, two wickets. But Steve Smith is still batting, and that might be considered a problem for England. 43rd over: Australia 143-4 (Smith 59, Marsh 8) Curran goes around the wicket to Smith, who belts him through mid-off for four. Next plan! \u201cRe the question of safe places,\u201d says Risha Mohyeddin. \u201cWhy is everyone so sure of Warner\u2019s position in this Aussie team? He\u2019s had a shocking series. Does he have something on the selectors that we don\u2019t know about?\u201d It\u2019s not a sure thing, because he was really has had a shocker, but I suspect most people think he has enough credit in the bank. 42nd over: Australia 137-4 (Smith 54, Marsh 7) Broad replaces Leach, starting with a maiden to Marsh. He\u2019s an attractive batsman, particularly when he thumps those front-foot drives, but his Test record is fairly modest. He averages 26 from 32 Tests - but he did hammer 181 against England at Perth in 2017-18. 41st over: Australia 137-4 (Smith 54, Marsh 7) \u201cAs this has been a difficult series for batsmen not called Smith or Marnus, who would be considered to have enough in the bank to not have their place in doubt?\u201d says Grif. \u201cWarner will be alright, but how about Denly, Buttler and Bairstow? Wade? Both sides could see a few changes moving forward from here.\u201d Burns, Stokes, Root and probably Warner are safe. Everyone else is up for discussion, I reckon. 40th over: Australia 132-4 (Smith 52, Marsh 4) Bish, bosh: Smith charges Leach to muscle an emphatic six over wide long-on. That brings up his 10th consecutive fifty against England. The man is an absolute disgrace to the law of averages. 39th over: Australia 124-4 (Smith 44, Marsh 4) Curran has bowled pretty well to Smith, giving him a different problem to solve; a new spirit to crush. \u201cAs others have noted, Bairstow\u2019s fake dismissal of Smith should have led to a five-run penalty,\u201d says Aeddan Shaw. \u201cCould this be a new England tactic, securing a win by umpires missing something that would otherwise have meant they lost (see the World Cup final and, kind of, Headingley). All will be revealed on Monday when England win by three runs...\u201d Heh. That would have been a particularly miserable enforcement of the laws \u2013 it\u2019s not like Bairstow was seeking to gain an advantage. It was just a bit of fun. Once Smith has won the match with his usual double hundred, he should go out on the field and repeat Bairstow\u2019s trick while paying tribute to Andrew McDonald. 38th over: Australia 119-4 (Smith 43, Marsh 0) England beseech Marais Erasmus to give Marsh out LBW to Leach. Not a flicker from Erasmus, and England decide - rightly - not to risk their last review. It was missing leg. \u201cMy Yorkshire terrier, Butch, has a habit of jumping on the lounge pouffe just before Australia lose a wicket!\u201d says Pete Higginson. \u201cHe\u2019s been on three times today. Now I\u2019m tempting him to jump on for a fourth time with a juicy dog biscuit.\u201d A box of Bonios will be with you by 4pm. 37th over: Australia 118-4 (Smith 42, Marsh 0) A wicket maiden from Curran, who switched ends to replace Woakes. \u201cFrom what I can tell, (and assuming Andrew Samson hasn\u2019t already made this point on TMS), Marnus is now fourth in the all-time batting averages for those without a century (min 10 innings),\u201d says Robert Smithson. \u201cPoints available for those who can guess the other three (most recent in the 60s).\u201d It\u2019s a great question. And I haven\u2019t a clue. I was going to suggest Bruce Laird but he played after that. Yep, Wade goes. It was a very full delivery that beat Wade\u2019s attempted flick to leg and hit him low on the front pad. Replays show it was hitting the outside of leg stump, and that\u2019s good enough for England. Wade walks off shaking his head about something or other. AUSTRALIA REVIEW! Wade has been given out LBW to Sam Curran. It\u2019s tight but I suspect this will be out. 36th over: Australia 118-3 (Smith 42, Wade 19) Jack Leach comes into the attack for the first time in the match. His fourth ball hits Wade on the pad and whistles just wide of Buttler at short leg. At first I thought it hit the bat or glove as well, although replays weren\u2019t conclusive. \u201cAnyone who is still complaining that Steven Smith is an ugly batsman does not like cricket,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cI cannot begin to describe what a privilege it is to watch him bat, especially today, when he has played some gorgeous strokes. I decided a while ago that he was the best batsman I\u2019ve ever seen and, incredibly, he\u2019s getting better.\u201d Steady on, Gary. It\u2019s possible to prefer watching David Gower or Mark Waugh without being outed in polite society as a secret cricket-hater. But I do know what you mean, and I\u2019m starting to grudgingly accept that he\u2019s even better than Lara and Viv. 35th over: Australia 115-3 (Smith 41, Wade 17) That\u2019s a very attractive shot from Wade, a hold-the-pose back-foot drive through cover point for four. Woakes is having another bad day. I\u2019m not sure which came first: Woakes\u2019 poor form or Joe Root\u2019s mistrust. Each perpetuates the other, I know that much. 34th over: Australia 109-3 (Smith 40, Wade 12) This, as the magnificent Ricky Ponting observes on Sky Sports, is a big innings for Matthew Wade. A score here should ensure his place for the Australian summer, when batting will be a darned sight easier than it has been this summer. I\u2019ve just seen that Wade appeal again - he clearly got an inside edge on the ball, but the third umpire disagreed and went to ball tracking. Australia would have gone mad had he been given out, and they\u2019d have had every right to do so. 33rd over: Australia 107-3 (Smith 40, Wade 10) Wade works Woakes through midwicket for three to move into double figures, and then Smith drives majestically through mid-on for four. He\u2019s closing in on yet another half- century. Wade is not out He played around a nipbacker from Woakes that hit him on the flap of the back pad, but it was missing leg stump so England lose a review. He probably hit it as well, although the third umpire didn\u2019t think so. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. Let\u2019s start with an England review for LBW against Matthew Wade. I don\u2019t think this is out. 32nd over: Australia 100-3 (Smith 36, Wade 7) This is So Steve Smith. Twice Curran thinks he has his man, swinging a ball into the pads. Twice Smith just picks him off for two runs through midwicket. I wonder if someone has suggested to England that this isn\u2019t working? Smith goes past Greg Chappell\u2019s 702 and George Headley\u2019s 703, one against the Windies in 1975-76, the other for the Windies against England in 1929-30. There are still 30 players ahead of Smith, which seems bizarre. But he\u2019ll knock a few more off, you feel. I\u2019m out, with drinks on the field, and Rob Smyth is now your best cricket friend. 31st over: Australia 94-3 (Smith 30, Wade 7) That last boundary takes Smith to 701. So for series returns he\u2019s gone past Clyde Walcott\u2019s 698 against England in 1953-54, and Doug Walters\u2019 699 against the West Indies in 1968-69. Woakes bowls wide to Wade, who creams a square drive for four. 30th over: Australia 90-3 (Smith 30, Wade 3) Archer versus Matthew Wade. This could be interesting. Around the wicket to the attacking lefty. Full rather than short, Wade defends. Then punches the next ball straight, runs! Leach has to belt across from mid-on to long-off, throwing back in. Now here\u2019s a little vignette. Smith is running to the safe end, the throw going to the bowler. But Bairstow tricks him. Straight up panto. Comes to the stumps as though he\u2019s about to receive the ball. Smith see it and dives! Full length, splat, sending up a cloud of debris. Then gets up to find dirt all down his front and Bairstow cackling madly. So Smith steps across and slots the next ball off his pads for four. Archer gets him! All that fast stuff has got him on the back foot, so he\u2019s hanging back when he gets a fuller ball. He plays it badly, coming across the line of the ball rather than straight. But with his weight back he can only jab at the ball with no control. Can\u2019t get in front of his pad, and Archer nails it. Dead in front. 29th over: Australia 81-2 (Labuschagne 46, Smith 26) It\u2019s not entirely clear what Woakes\u2019 game is. In at the legs this time. He\u2019s got Steve Smith out lbw twice in Test cricket: once at Lord\u2019s after Archer had knocked him out, and once in the night session at Adelaide when the pink ball was hooping. It\u2019s a maiden, Smith patient. 28th over: Australia 81-2 (Labuschagne 46, Smith 26) Archer! Another fizzing over, but again it doesn\u2019t take a wicket. He draws a thick edge from Labuschagne, down through the gully for four. Then bowls a proper bouncer that has Marnus doing gymnastics to get out of the way. 27th over: Australia 77-2 (Labuschagne 42, Smith 26) Broad has been seen out, Woakes is back. It\u2019s a maiden, though most of it goes past Smith\u2019s leg stump to the wicketkeeper, back of a length. Weird and deliberate, or just... bad? Trevor Tutu emails in. \u201cWe are all looking forward to the Newlands Test, and South Africa always deserves to win. What I see is that Australia has managed to benefit from South Africa\u2019s loss. The commentators are saying that Labuschagne has modelled his technique on that of Smith. May I suggest that he looks like Kepler Wessels?\u201d What do all the Wessels enthusiasts think? 26th over: Australia 77-2 (Labuschagne 42, Smith 26) Smith has gone past the 692 that Virat Kohli scored in Australia in 2015-15. And the 693 that Patsy Hendren got in the West Indies in 1929-30. And the 696 that Arthur Morris got here in 1948. So in Ashes contests, only Mark Taylor (839) and Don Bradman (758, 810, 974) have more runs in a series for Australia. Labuschagne is hit in the arm by Archer, and there\u2019s a long break as the the doctor comes to check him out. Eventually he\u2019s patched up and will continue, getting through the maiden over. 25th over: Australia 77-2 (Labuschagne 42, Smith 26) In that last over, Smith in this series went past the 687 that he made in Australia during the previous Ashes. He\u2019s happy to leave Broad for three balls of the over, but when there\u2019s width Smith tries to clobber it. Short and wide, he played a cut shot with a lot of flourish. He doesn\u2019t time it, into the ground to point, who fumbles but not enough. Smith scolds himself in the middle. Broad follows up by overpitching, and this time it disappears for four! Through cover. Smith moves along. 24th over: Australia 73-2 (Labuschagne 42, Smith 22) Beautiful from Archer, as he nips the ball in, and Labuschagne nicks into his pads. Ducks a short ball, defends, but then the pressure breaks, too straight as Marnus stabs a single. Smith wanders across and makes it look easy against a good line outside off, flicking it through square leg for two runs. Then pushes a single through cover. Richard Stanton emails in. \u201cIn Australia, where I guess many of your readers are sitting, TMS is on the ABC app as a \u2018pop-up channel\u2019 called Men\u2019s Ashes.\u201d Thanks Richard. If you flick on your old analogue radio it might also be on ABC Local. The callsigns of 774 in Melbourne, 702 in Sydney, and so on. Not too sure what the broadcast schedule has been. 23rd over: Australia 69-2 (Labuschagne 41, Smith 19) They\u2019ve taken out cover for Broad, who bowls short, and Smith smokes him through the gap for four! A back-foot punch, gorgeously efficient, just timing the ball away with the bat close to his body. Lovely stuff. Then Smith laces the next ball to cover, who has been moved into the gap, and Archer prevents another boundary. 22nd over: Australia 65-2 (Labuschagne 41, Smith 15) Archer gets to bowl to Smith now. Starts with a bouncer, predictably. Smith ducks, leaves, blocks. Then gets across his stumps and works a shot to midwicket for one. Off strike. He does it so easily. 21st over: Australia 64-2 (Labuschagne 41, Smith 14) Broad from the Pavilion End, wide, and Labuschagne lashes him for four! Up and over backward point, carved that way with an open face. He\u2019s played a couple of big shots wide of the stumps today, which seems more daring than he has been before. Perhaps deciding the conditions today are more favourable to taking the initiative. It raises the 50 stand from 89 balls. 20th over: Australia 60-2 (Labuschagne 37, Smith 14) Archer warms up with a gimme, and Marnus takes it. Off the pads through midwicket. Fourski. Then flicks a single to fine leg. Not Archer\u2019s finest of the summer. Give him a minute. We\u2019re back, everyone\u2019s fed, and Archer has the ball. A few people have asked for the overseas TMS link, which is here. \u201cAt least the harvest labourers (16th over) traditionally get plenty of cider as part of the job,\u201d writes John Starbuck. \u201cLunch at the Oval might not be quite the same.\u201d It\u2019s a model of temperance as far as I can see. There lies the break. Australia bowled out England this morning while conceding only a further 23 runs. Not a bad result for the visitors. Then the Australian innings proceeded as it has done all series: the openers gone cheaply, and Smith not gone at all. He\u2019ll be back after the break, and maybe after the next break, and the next as well. Archer bowled with vim this morning, Broad was not especially effective, and Curran has posed a couple of questions when he has got it right. England still have a chance to take a decisive advantage, but they need wickets after lunch. I\u2019m going to find some (lunch, not wickets) myself, and will rejoin you shortly. 19th over: Australia 55-2 (Labuschagne 32, Smith 14) Curran to take us up to the lunch break, and he\u2019s too wide when he\u2019s across the batsmen, and again picked off for a single and a leg bye from the balls on the pads. Australia\u2019s (only) two batsmen have done it again. 18th over: Australia 53-2 (Labuschagne 31, Smith 14) Woakes to Labuschagne, and again bowling on the legs for the batsman to clip for four. The Australian 50 comes up. Woakes goes a bit short and draws a glove from Marnus, a false stroke at least. 17th over: Australia 49-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 14) Curran is improving his line against Smith. An appeal for a swinging ball that hits pad, then an even bigger one when Smith shoulders arms and lets it hit his pad. But both times the ball is angling across too much. The second one was outside the line of off by the time it hit him, and would have been going further away. Smith isn\u2019t bothered, and again kicks the ball away from the sixth delivery of the over. It\u2019s a maiden. 16th over: Australia 49-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 14) Here is Chris Woakes. Underbowled in the first three Tests, not picked in the fourth, and left until the 16th over for a shot in the fifth. It\u2019s been a strange Test summer for him, tactically. And he starts poorly, perhaps trying too hard. On the pads, Smith ticking a run before Marnus clips four. Then even further down leg for the Labrador to glance to fine leg for another boundary. \u201cI\u2019ve just loaded up the OBO to see how things are going,\u201d writes Tom van der Gucht. \u201cSeeing Smith and Labuschagne are batting, I may as well not bother checking it again until tomorrow afternoon. These two will still be ploughing out the runs then as the England bowlers toil away in the autumnal field like harvest labourers.\u201d Come, Tom. If a van der Gucht can\u2019t appreciate a Labuschagne, what sort of world are we living in? 15th over: Australia 40-2 (Labuschagne 19, Smith 13) Smart running from Smith! He plays just a defensive push, but it rolls past Curran the bowler and near the non-striker\u2019s stumps. Yes! shouts Smith and sprints after the ball, knowing that he\u2019s going to the danger end as Broad has to get across to field. Marnus responds and they get through. It nearly brings about a wicket two balls later though, as Labuschagne drives at width once again, edging for four! Past Stokes at third slip, who dives and nearly gets a fingertip to it. If Stokes misses it, anyone would have missed it. Labuschagne has looked ropey against Curran, drawn into a few shots. 14th over: Australia 35-2 (Labuschagne 15, Smith 12) Archer bowls another maiden to Labuschagne, mostly too wide to play but one ball fizzes past the edge. \u201cYou seem pretty certain that Ultra Edge is playing up,\u201d writes Steve Phillips, \u201cbut are ignoring (from what I can see) that TV replays only have a certain number of frames per second, and so will not always capture the point of impact, while Ultra Edge is a continuous line. The fact that they don\u2019t always match is a result of this for tiny snicks. This is much like the debate on extremely tight offside and VAR - the point of contact with the ball will not always be in an exact frame, so we can\u2019t be sure. But that\u2019s a debate for another day / thread.\u201d That\u2019s a fair point, Steve. In today\u2019s case though the issue is that Warner\u2019s replay shows a gap between bat and ball regardless of the frame. The trajectory doesn\u2019t (I think) take it past the edge. And the other part of the issue is that the UltraEdge microphone can pick up any noise near it, not just ball on bat. It\u2019s not that the technology was wrong, it\u2019s that it sometimes gets interpreted wrong. 13th over: Australia 35-2 (Labuschagne 15, Smith 12) No margin for error for Curran with his left-armer\u2019s angle to the right-hander. On Smith\u2019s pads, he\u2019s worked away for two runs. Trying to push the ball further across, he\u2019s too wide and laced through cover for four. Smith is up to a dozen already. Just the 292 to go. 12th over: Australia 29-2 (Labuschagne 15, Smith 6) Archer again, and Smith is away! Flowing cover drive, through the fuller ball. Jack Leach gives hot pursuit to the longest boundary out in front of the scoreboard, and wins a huge cheer as he dives to catch up and flick back for three. Too much width thereafter to Labuschagne, who leaves alone. \u201cGiven the slow over rates,\u201d suggests Martin Gillam, \u201cwhy not save time by simply having Australia start every innings at 20 for two, with Smith and Labuschagne batting? And not that those two need a gilding of their achievements in this series, but I imagine they pad up quite quickly at the change of innings.\u201d Very good. 11th over: Australia 26-2 (Labuschagne 15, Smith 3) Time for Sam Curran. Player of the series last year, not getting a chance until the fifth Test this year. Left-arm, angled across Labuschagne. He takes advantage of the angle to cover-drive four, but misses another attempt. There\u2019s an inch between bat and ball, but there\u2019s a spike on UltraEdge again. So that\u2019s out under the new rules, isn\u2019t it? 10th over: Australia 22-2 (Labuschagne 11, Smith 3) Archer is doing it again! Bowling a fascinating spell, I mean. He aborts a celebrappeal after realising the ball took an inside edge into Smith\u2019s pad. It was also way high, but any contact with Smith\u2019s pad is a victory. Then Archer pulls the length back, cuts the ball away, and makes Smith waft off the back foot at fresh air. Meanwhile on TMS, Glenn McGrath is carefully saving a moth and releasing it out the window. Big mean fast bowler indeed. 9th over: Australia 22-2 (Labuschagne 11, Smith 3) It\u2019s Broad who knocks the release valve with his elbow, sliding onto the pads where Marnus can clip him for four! That has been one of the strengths for Labuschagne: even when he\u2019s defending for a long period, he\u2019s still ready to take on the scoring chance when a bad ball comes. \u201cAm I correct in thinking that when Bradman scored his 974 runs in a series there were 6 Test matches rather than 5? If this is the case then surely an average needs to be worked out for this and Smith doesn\u2019t need as many. However if he does get them playing less matches then it surely puts him as King of All Batting Superheroes.\u201d You\u2019re not quite correct, Paul Frew. Bradman only batted seven times for his 974. From memory that included scores of 14, 1 and 8. The other four knocks went alright. Smith is currently in his sixth innings, so he could have seven if he bats again. He gets off the mark here, walking across to Broad to clip two, then a single. So he\u2019s 301 short of passing Bradman. 8th over: Australia 14-2 (Labuschagne 6, Smith 0) ... but the real action is at the other end. Archer versus Smith again, with some pace in the pitch and some sunshine around. Archer looks much happier than in the freezing wind of Manchester wearing about three cricket jumpers. Smith has a flash outside off stump. Archer fields a defensive shot and throws it at Smith. But soon enough the batsman is into his rhythm, stepping across to get behind the ball outside off, and to hop and fend off the one into the body. Maiden. 7th over: Australia 14-2 (Labuschagne 6, Smith 0) Broad makes Labuschagne play at nearly every ball this over, and it\u2019s another maiden. England turning the screws... 6th over: Australia 14-2 (Labuschagne 6, Smith 0) Archer\u2019s 18th wicket in his fourth Test of this series. He has one ball at Smith, a bouncer on a good testing line that Smith ducks forward under. Smith needs 304 in the match to break Bradman\u2019s record of 974 in a series. Anyone backing him? Heeeeeere\u2019s Smithy... Caught at slip! Harris\u2019 unhappy tour continues in the vein of Warner\u2019s, as Archer angled in from around the wicket, perhaps took the ball away slightly, and even though Harris was just blocking from the crease the ball strikes high on the shoulder of the bat and into the cordon, low and dipping on Stokes at third slip who takes the catch well. 5th over: Australia 14-1 (Harris 3, Labuschagne 6) Broad now, and Marnus is leaving whenever he can. He has played a greater proportion of leaves than any batsman in the series. He does nick one when he can\u2019t get the bat away in time, though, and it bounces through to the cordon. 4th over: Australia 14-1 (Harris 3, Labuschagne 6) Archer again, bowls one lovely delivery to Harris that leaves him like a Communards song. A maiden. \u201cWith all the talk in England about the lamentable batting, has a similar thing been happening in Australia?\u201d asks Michael Hall. \u201cDo you think this series might see the end of Warner, or does he still have enough credit from before Sandpapergate to see him through the winter?\u201d He still has 21 Test tons, so he\u2019ll be in the side for the home summer for sure. Get his groove back in home conditions. It would be a silly overreaction to turf a player with that record on the back of a bad series. 3rd over: Australia 14-1 (Harris 3, Labuschagne 6) Broad to Labuschagne, angle, into the right-hander\u2019s pads and a big appeal. Not out. Maybe a touch high, maybe just outside the line. Runs in the over though as well: Harris clips three, Marnus two, then a short ball from Broad is cracked through midwicket by Marnus for four. Well timed shot. 2nd over: Australia 5-1 (Harris 0, Labuschagne 0) Any rate, it\u2019s another failure in the book, and another paltry opening partnership. England\u2019s 27 in the first innings here remains the best opening stand of the series for either side. Archer started from the Vauxhall End. Warner got an edge second ball, played with nice soft hands into the ground, into the gap in the cordon, into the boundary cushion for four. But tried to lather the fifth and instead got a bath. Marnus in the Middle starts early. Controversially out. Width from Archer, and short. Warner swats at it wide of off stump and misses, from all appearances. Bairstow goes up, and the cordon half goes up. Then after a long chat they send the not out decision to DRS. On the replay it looks to me like there\u2019s daylight between bat and ball. The ball is close to the edge, but never clearly touching the bat. Yet when the UltraEdge comes up, there\u2019s movement on the graph. Not a spike, like leather on willow usually creates, but a flatter bobble. Which could be the batsman\u2019s spikes on the ground, or something else. But the third umpire says that there\u2019s movement, and that\u2019s enough. Erasmus has his decision overturned on the basis of very sketchy evidence. Warner played a bad shot, but I don\u2019t think you can look at that replay and credibly say he hit the ball. 1st over: Australia 1-0 (Warner 1, Harris 0) Warner will take first ball, choosing to face Broad. Wanting to be positive, take on the challenge. He\u2019s done that a couple of times recently and it hasn\u2019t worked. Three ducks in 10 balls against Broad. You can see why with the first two balls. One is wide. The next is very wide. Warner slaps at both of them, and misses. You can hear Jim Maxwell chuckling at the back of the TMS box. \u201cHe\u2019s going to need a longer bat,\u201d says Michael Vaughan. The second one should have been called wide, really. Third ball... Warner\u2019s off the mark! Gets a run this time, angled in at the stumps and he jams his bat down, gets a leading edge along the ground into the covers for one. The David Warner v Stuart Broad contest will now re-commence. Thus far: lbw Broad for 2 caught behind from Broad for 8 bowled by Broad for 3 lbw Broad for 0 caught behind from Broad for 0 lbw Broad for 0 \u201cGeoff, what is the proportionate response to those saying \u2018but it\u2019s his natural game\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019s a World Cup hangover\u2019 to Buttler being bowled from a T20 shot in the first half hour of the day? A court order banning them from every cricket ground and the OBO?\u201d asks Dominic O\u2019Reilly. Well, he played some T20 shots off Hazlewood yesterday and it worked quite nicely. I just think he didn\u2019t need to go after Cummins, specifically. But it\u2019s easy to criticise after that fact. The sun is shining gloriously. Great day for batting. Buttler and Leach added 68 in all, which made a big difference, but didn\u2019t add enough additional runs this morning to wrest the initiative. Andrew Samson on TMS says that England add an average of over 50 runs while Jack Leach is at the crease in Test cricket. So 294 doesn\u2019t look like a huge total, but runs on the board can be worth more than you think. It\u2019s a total bigger than Australia would have hoped for after sending England in, certainly. The main question, as ever in this series, is what Steve Smith can do. He might make 294 on his own, like Alastair Cook once did at Edgbaston. England must get him. But that\u2019s been the story forever. Five wickets for Mitchell Marsh! His first time in Test cricket! He spreads both arms to the sky and beams, gloriously, like the English September sun on his face. What a lovely moment for a player who gets more than his share of barbs, but retains that cheerful outlook regardless. He\u2019s done the job for Australia! And he did it by pitching up. Some swing, on the pads, and Leach tried to work the ball square but didn\u2019t get it. 87th over: England 294-9 (Leach 21, Broad 0) Buttler out from the first ball of the over, so Cummins... bowls everything else short at Broad and doesn\u2019t look like getting him out. They haven\u2019t got their balance quite right. The specialist goes before the tailender! Full and at leg stump, Buttler clears his leg and tries to pump the ball straight, instead he misses and it hits his pad outside leg stump and ricochets back onto the timber. It didn\u2019t feel necessary to play such a big shot at that stage, with Leach hanging in there and runs to be collected rather than plundered. 86th over: England 294-8 (Buttler 70, Leach 21) Buttler is doing a half-and-half sort of job of farming the strike, turning down a single to deep point from the third ball, then taking one from the fourth. Marsh bowls to Leach, who edges him for four! 85th over: England 289-8 (Buttler 69, Leach 17) Buttler blocks a couple from Cummins then winds up for a wipe but finds the field. He flirts with the idea of giving himself room outside leg, so Cummins tries to follow him and instead bowls straight to fine leg for five wides. Buttler glances a single from the re-bowled fourth ball. Cummins has two balls at Leach... and they\u2019re both short. Have the Australians learned nothing from Headingley. 84th over: England 283-8 (Buttler 68, Leach 17) Mitchell Marsh to take the almost new ball from the other end. Interesting move. Perhaps Paine wants to get him a fifth wicket? Perhaps they think he\u2019ll swing the ball more. Hazlewood would normally be your pick, though? A couple of defensive shots from Leach, given he farmed the strike. And then there he goes! What a shot! A square drive for four from Leach, when he gets width and strides into the ball. He follows up with a brace, a more modest checked drive to cover. This is wonderful stuff from Leach. 83rd over: England 277-8 (Buttler 68, Leach 11) Thanks JP, and good morning from The Oval to everyone around the world. It\u2019s cricket time. Whatever you make of Buttler (he\u2019s very good, sorry) he is here to do something fun this morning. Hopefully. Pat Cummins will start with the ball. Can Buttler and Leach put together more of a stand to annoy the Aussies? They put on 45 together last night, from memory. Buttler wants to get his eye in, and waits and watches against Cummins, until the fourth ball cuts in and ricochets for a leg bye. Buttler takes it, perhaps thinking to minimise Leach\u2019s time on strike. But Leach is having none of that, pushing a single to cover! Resigned to his fate, Buttler blasts a wide ball through cover point for four. I\u2019m sure Geoff Lemon has a clear vision for England\u2019s middle-order. If you want to prise it from his fertile mind you can find him on Twitter or email. He\u2019s all yours for the next few hours. I\u2019ll see you again tomorrow. Ian Forth can have my final post of the morning before Geoff Lemon strides in confidently to mark his guard. \u201cEach new series brings new entrants in what the legendary Irish writer Flann O\u2019Brien once termed the catechism of cliche,\u201d Ian emails. \u201cIn honour of the great man, allow me to observe. Q. Out of what has the fielding position of forward short leg these days gone? A. The game. Q. To what did the World Cup Final after eight weeks, six days and seven hours of incredible entertainment, marked by the joyous participation of a capacity crowd at the Home of Cricket come down to? A: This.\u201d \u201cThe argument over whether a specialist wicketkeeper who can\u2019t bat is more vital for a team than a so-so wicketkeeper who CAN bat has a long history,\u201d begins Roy Greenslade (of this parish?). \u201cI pine for the arrival of a re-born Godfrey Evans. Look at that record: 219 dismissals in 91 Tests and the first English player to reach both 1,000 runs and 100 dismissals and then 2,000 runs and 200 dismissals in Tests.\u201d Some revamped England XIs starting to filter through now. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a top seven of Burns, Sibley, Root, Stokes, Pope, Buttler, Foakes given a run, and dropped players (Roy, Bairstow, Ali, Denly) who want to make it back into the side need to demonstrate why they should.\u201d That\u2019s from Joe Cross. George Brown has gone for \u201cSibley, Burns, Denley, Root, Stokes, Bairstow / Buttler, Buttler (Wk) / Foakes (Wk ), Archer, Leach, Broad, Anderson. We\u2019d drop YJB for a bit and tell him that we need his runs more than we need his gloves - he\u2019s only getting back in the side as a batsman, partly to upset him (this always seems to produce his best) and partly to show him that he\u2019s not untouchable.\u201d But Peter Davies gets the last word. \u201cI have a suggestion: pick an England team consisting of 10 bowlers and a keeper. This would mean every innings would consist purely of dogged lower order resistance, and we might get some runs. And one of them might know how to get Smith out, as a bonus.\u201d Anthony Galvin has done the over rate math(s). \u201cI was at the Oval yesterday and it cost me about \u00a31.30 an over. I\u2019d be happy to have a pay-per-over seat, which would take care of rain delays, extra hours etc.. The bars at the Oval are cashless and able to refund the money for your returnable beer glass back onto your card at the end of the day, so technology isn\u2019t the problem here. Make this a problem for the money men and they\u2019ll soon get onto the players if they are refunding everyone on the way out of the ground!\u201d Amen! \u201cYour man Duncan\u2019s point on wicket-keepers living in a post-Gilchrist world is an interesting one,\u201d emails Richard McConnell. \u201cI am personally mystified that Foakes, who is a vastly superior keeper and a decent bat, can\u2019t find a place in the team this summer. With all the questions around Root\u2019s role as captain and his waning average with the bat, how much of as burden are the gloves on YJB and Buttler? It feels like a team built on a foundation of compromise. Bring in Foakes and let YJB and Buttler fight it out.\u201d Hard to disagree. Funny how in victory that \u201cfoundation of compromise\u201d (a lovely turn of phrase) is celebrated as flexibility and boldness. At the end of the day it comes down to scoring runs and taking 20 wickets as often as possible. Staying with Australian cricket, Shane Warne has put his name to an MCC report calling for action to address the climate crisis because of its impact on cricket around the world. Tanya Aldred has more. Warne was part of the MCC World Committee that was last month given a preview of the Hit for Six report, published on Tuesday, which examined the threats that face cricket-playing nations, many situated in areas of the world most vulnerable to the changing climate. Geoff Lemon, our resident Australian correspondent, was finally given a new storyline to write about yesterday, in the form of the revitalised Mitch Marsh. Shaun has made a few of the most brilliant Test hundreds of the last decade but can also slump like no other \u2013 barely a specialist batsman in history has scored in single figures as frequently. Mitch has shown glimpses of 90mph bowling and heavy run-scoring, but has never strung them together and at times has been abandoned by both. Predictably, his selection in this Ashes squad in July brought complaints, as did his mooted selection for the fourth Test at Old Trafford, and confirmation of his eventual selection for the fifth. There must have been a moment of double-take in the Australian morning for some of his detractors who woke up to see his first-day figures of four for 35. And Rob Little has joined in too, very much in the pro-Buttler camp. \u201cI don\u2019t disagree about Buttler \u2013 he has been oddly underwhelming at times, particularly in this series \u2013 but if you peruse the statistics of *all* England batsmen since his recall (May 2018) I think he does quite well (note that eg Bairstow in that period averages 24). I\u2019d say it\u2019d be harsh to leave him out for the winter tours.\u201d Mike Gershon has joined in the discussion about where Jos Buttler best fits into this England XI. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering this summer how he, Bairstow and others might bat if we had a consistently solid top four, so that the potentially explosive middle order batsmen could come in against a softer, older ball, with the bowlers having more overs in their legs. Seeing Buttler revert to some of his ODI style batting yesterday was great, and it clearly put Paine on the back foot. All we need to do is find a new opener to partner Burns and an accomplished number 3 batsman. Oh, wait...\u201d Frustrating isn\u2019t it? But also, at what point does one cut ones losses? Sunk cost fallacy and all... Ian Forth has failed to realise that I\u2019m not an executive producer at a major movie studio. Easy mistake to make, mind you. \u201cAh, The Smith Supremacy. Cricket cognoscenti insist that Smith is great for the game, what a time it is to be alive, etc. Absolute nonsense, of course. The only thing that\u2019s ruined this series is Smith being the ringer from the first eleven playing in the under-13s. Imagine if we\u2019d had five Headingleys instead.\u201d Five Headingleys AND a Boycott knighthood in the same summer? You haven\u2019t thought this through Ian. Barney Ronay has written about Joe Root\u2019s misfortune. On a crisp, browny-green south London day Root had looked at times like a man draining the last drops of juice from the tank. With good reason. Since the start of May Root has played 24 international matches across three formats, with the full hand in recent weeks of captaincy, post-match blah, dawn stress and night-time insomnia. Even walking to the wicket at first drop these last two matches England\u2019s captain has resembled some bedraggled desert soldier emerging from the dunes at Alexandria, khakis caked with salt and sand, craving just a single cold beer and the credits. Kim Thonger\u2019s punched his card for the day. \u201cI read this headline ECB faces backlash over stimulus package just now and my first thought was, aha, people are finally realising the stupidity of the ECB\u2019s \u2018The Hundred\u2019 format and are kicking off about it. Sadly it\u2019s about the European Central Bank printing Monopoly money or some such. When WILL all we sensible peaceful Test Match cricket fans rise up as one against the buffoons in the committee rooms? (I\u2019m free Tuesday afternoon?)\u201d Ha, that made think of the Death of a Gentleman movie and the excellent Sam Collins and Jarrod Kimber stalking N. Srinivasan. \u201cHi Jonathan,\u201d hi Duncan Stackhouse. \u201cWhat do you think of Buttler in the Test team? For some reason I rate him more than Bairstow as a Test cricketer even though he has an inferior average (32 to 35) and fewer hundreds (1 to 6). I have a feeling it\u2019s because he looks much better in defence, allied to the fact that Bairstow gets bowled way too much. In terms of averages though, both of them would be about par for wicketkeeper batsmen. I think it was Geoff Lemon who wrote that our idea of what wicketkeepers can manage has been warped by Gilchrist (and to a lesser extent Sangakkara and ABdV, who stopped keeping to help their batting). Anyway, to the point. My 5, 6, 7 moving forward would be Pope, Buttler, Foakes (don\u2019t ask me where stokes goes, 3?). Mainly because I feel YJB needs to be dropped and I just have a feeling that Jos might yet become our ABdV. What do you reckon?\u201d It\u2019s a tough one to answer pithily, but here\u2019s my take. I like the idea of Jos Buttler. I think his ceiling as a Test cricketer is high, if only he can find consistent form and a clearly defined role. But I think it\u2019s time he\u2019s picked as a top-six batsman or not at all. He\u2019s 29 and been around Test cricket for five years now without returning the sort of numbers to demand reselection. Apologies, I\u2019ve logged on in a bit of a grumpy mood (any suggestions for shaking it, gratefully accepted) but it means I can\u2019t overlook that yesterday - a fine and dry day of Test cricket - featured just 82 overs. And that includes an extra half-hour after the scheduled close. Come on ICC, come on international captains, get a grip! Don\u2019t take my word on the state of play at the start of day two, take Vic Marks\u2019s. Two contrasting half-centuries kept England afloat \u2013 just about \u2013 on an another engaging day of Test cricket. Joe Root dutifully grafted away without inspiration in the first half of the day, while Jos Buttler for the first time in the series unfurled some of his one-day magic in the final session. The upshot was that England finished the day on 271 for eight; Australia will not be too disappointed by that; England might be relieved given that they had sunk to 226 for eight before Buttler and Jack Leach combined under the floodlights. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of day two of the fifth Ashes Test from the Oval. The state of play on this second morning is reflective of much of the series. The game is unfolding on Australia\u2019s terms after a solid but far from flawless display in the field proved enough to expose England\u2019s frailties with the bat. Rory Burns once again made a decent start, and once again Joe Root chipped in, but neither made the Smithian contribution demanded of them, leaving the scoreboard on the dreary side once the all-too common collapse occurred. Some early evening biff from Jos Buttler put some smiles on some faces but it served only to remind England followers what they were missing when the Ashes were still there to be won. Frustratingly, considering the state of the series, little new was gleaned from yesterday\u2019s action to add to the planning for future contests. The dismissals of Joe Denly and Jonny Bairstow in particular were agonisingly predictable. Australia can take heart from Mitch Marsh\u2019s show stealing performance with the ball. They can now look forward to almost three full days during which Steve Smith has the freedom to play merry hell with all sorts of records. I\u2019m around for the next hour or so to keep this show on the road, but when play begins Geoff Lemon will step into the breach. If you want to share your thoughts with the world during the next hour or so you can send them to me on Twitter or by email.",

There has been a renewed drive in No 10 for an agreement since parliamentarians passed a law aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and twice rejected Johnson\u2019s demand for a snap general election. However the government has no plans to publish any detailed written proposals as the prime minister seeks to avoid Theresa May\u2019s fate of having her carefully constructed compromise shot down publicly by party colleagues. Downing Street believes little compromise will be forthcoming from the EU side before the crucial European council summit on 17 October \u2013 and it plans to blame rebel parliamentarians if it does not materialise. A Downing Street source said: \u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to move yet \u2013 it\u2019s going to be the 17th before we get any flash of light: but [Jeremy] Corbyn and his surrender bill has significantly diminished the chance of getting a deal.\u201d Efforts are focused on finding a way to allow customs and other checks to take place away from the Irish border, so that Northern Ireland can leave the EU customs union along with the rest of the UK.

      "bodyText": "Essex\u2019s championship charge stumbled as they were forced to spend the last day at Edgbaston batting to save the match. They were dismissed for 324 in the morning, also falling short of a crucial third batting point, with Warwickshire\u2019s captain Jeetan Patel pocketing six for 73. Asked to follow on, they had a stinker of a start at nought for one, but Tom Westley and Alastair Cook smoothed the waters with a partnership of 157. The teams shook hands after Westley was out for 97. The draw confirms that Warwickshire survive to play another Division One summer and sends winless Nottinghamshire down. Essex, eights points behind leaders Somerset, entertain Surrey at Chelmsford next week and go to Taunton for the final round. The Division Two championship race heated up after Sussex beat Gloucestershire in Bristol by eight wickets. Gloucestershire cobbled together 46 for their last four wickets but Sussex easily knocked off the 74 needed, after Phil Salt and Stiaan van Zyl put on an unbroken 41 for the third wicket. Sussex have refound their mojo just in time \u2013 and lie fifth in the table \u2013 in with a glimmer of a chance if they win both their remaining matches. Gloucestershire slip down to third. After the match, the Sussex coach, Jason Gillespie, said he had been on the phone to the England coach, Trevor Bayliss. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Trevor Bayliss if we can have Jofra Archer back for the last game, but the answer was no. That\u2019s fair enough. We had a bit of a joke about it. We\u2019ve decided not to bring in another overseas players for the last few games, like some of the other counties have done. We\u2019ll go with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d Northamptonshire easily beat bottom-of-the-table Leicestershire to secure second place in the table after Ben Curran and Alex Wakely made forties to ensure victory. \u201cMomentum is huge, we\u2019re playing with a lot of confidence,\u201d said Wakely afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s in our hands now, next week against Durham is a massive game. We want to finish second if we possibly can.\u201d So that\u2019s it from here for today - after Lancashire confirmed their promotion to Division One yesterday, today has signed Nottinghamshire\u2019s relegation warrant - therefore saving Warwickshire\u2019s place in Division One. It\u2019s all hotting up nicely for the last two rounds - with Somerset patting the nice eight point lead in their back pocket as they head for the Ageas Bowl; and all to play for in the remaining two Division Two promotion places. Thanks for all the messages and chat below the line and sticking with CCLive! on a quiet day. See you next week - good night! Win-less with only two rounds to go, Nottinghamshire are relegated to Division Two after a disastrous Championship campaign in which they have totted up only 11 batting points. They shake hands at Edgbaston after Tom Westley falls for 97 - giving him 237 runs in the match. Essex never recovered from their decision to bowl first - and now slip eight points behind Somerset in the championship race with just two games to go. WARWICKSHIRE RETAIN FIRST DIVISION STATUS FOR NEXT YEAR Good to see Jason Gillespie trying his hand for the last match of the season: \u201cI\u2019ve asked Trevor Bayliss if we can have Jofra Archer back for the last game, but the answer was no. That\u2019s fair enough, it was what I expected. We had a bit of a joke about it one the phone. We\u2019ve decided not to bring in another overseas players for the last few games, like some of the other counties have done. We\u2019ll go with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d In the Wantage Road area with some free time on your hands tonight? And things are purring over smoothly at Edgbaston - just time for both Westley (87 not out) and Alastair Cook (55 not out) to reach their hundreds before handshakes. Good news for Somerset fans - Tom Banton has just signed a new two-year contract extension. I\u2019ve just got an email from Somerset asking that anyone who wants to attend the final game against Essex lets them know as they\u2019re expecting heavy demand for media seats. Sky cameras will also be there. Uneasy lies the head that nearly wears the crown. Which leaves us with one..Warwickshire v Essex which is slowly meandering towards a draw. Essex 82-1 trail Warwickshire by 111, with 48 overs left in the day. A draw is still meaningful, as it will confirm Nottinghamshire\u2019s relegation, and Warwickshire\u2019s place in Division One for 2020. Van Zyl and Salt take Sussex safely home, which bunny-hops them up to fifth. See Div 2 table below. Thank you Mes for these lovely roses - good to see you are hedging you bets in case of an impromptu CCLive! garden party. Alastair Cook and Tom Westley nice and steady steady for Essex - 57-1. Some post-match quotes from Grace Road where Alex Wakely, who has stuck with Northants through thick and thin, is feeling positive. \u201cI feel in decent touch, I\u2019m enjoying batting without the pressures of captaincy, playing with a smile on my face. But everything is easy when you\u2019re winning! \u201cThat said, momentum is huge, we\u2019re playing with a lot of confidence, the balance of the team looks good and we\u2019re in a very good position. It\u2019s in our hands now, next week against Durham is a massive game. We want to finish second if we possibly can.\u201d I haven\u2019t worked this out so I hope it doesn\u2019t spell something rude like the rogue Guardian crossword the other day, but something to pass the afternoon. A lovely apple from the tree polishes off lunch nicely. Meanwhile at Bristol, Tom Haines has gone but Sussex are nearly there on their latest of late charges. Just 24 more to win. Curran and Wakely guide Northants to victory, which takes them up to second in the Division Two table, nine points ahead of Gloucestershire, 14 points clear of Durham, and 16 clear of Glamorgan, who will be overtaken by Sussex this afternoon. Division One Warwickshire 517; Essex 324 (Westley 141; Jeetan Patel 6-73) and 26-1. Essex trail by 167 runs with 9 wickets and 66 overs remaining . Division Two Gloucestershire 200 &amp; 243; Sussex 370 and 24-1. Sussex need 50 to win. Northants have lost a couple more wickets but it\u2019s almost in the bag - just 20 more needed. And THANK YOU so much to Wegie below the line for spotting this - it seems the Darren Stevens show may have another season yet to run. \u201cWe are allowed to change our minds and we want to reward performance,\u201d Kent head coach Matt Walker told BBC Radio Kent. \u201cAt the moment Darren\u2019s performances are right up there. \u201cWe have to get the balance right - especially at Kent - between still trying to be competitive and win, but also making sure young players are progressing.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with how he batted, more than how he bowled. Those runs at that stage of the game were very important. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t batted as well as he would have liked in this format and that was vintage Darren with the bat, which was great to see. \u201cAnd with the ball he\u2019s been fantastic for the last few wickets, as he has been for however many years.\u201d Safe to say that David Warner has a bit of a shocker. Out for 0 - lbw Broad Out for 0 - c Bairstow b Broad Out for 0 - lbw Broad Out for 61 - c Bairstow b Archer Out for 5 - c Burns b Archer Out for 3 - b Broad Out for 8 - c Bairstow b Broad Out for 2 - lbw Broad Out for 5 - c Bairstow b Archer Gloucestershire all out. Sussex need 84 to win. Ah! I forgot that the follow-on in county cricket is 150. Warwickshire have in fact enforced the follow on. And calamity! Nick Browne is out to the fourth ball of the innings. Essex 0/1. Essex all out after a pig of a morning for 324. A deficit of 193. Warwickshire just need to bat out the day to be assured of Division One cricket next year, and hand Somerset a tasty lead going into the final two rounds. The irrepressible Jeetan Patel finished with 6-73. A wicket at Grace Road, Rob Newton for 29, but surely too late for any last-minute wobbles. Northants 74-1, need 67. Thinking on the New Zealand tour - which, I was reminded at Lord\u2019s yesterday, won\u2019t count for the new Test World Championship. If they rest most of the World Cup &amp; Test players and hand the captaincy to Stokes - on the assumption that he would like to go back to New Zealand -who else gets on the plane? Some names to throw in the pot - Sibley, Crawley, Azad (too soon?), Pope, Foakes, Ollie Robinson, Donald, Malan, Gregory, Bartlett? Nice to see Ben Curran getting runs in what hasn\u2019t quite been the breakthrough season he was hoping for - only one fifty in nine innings to date. When men were men, and phones were MASSIVE. Essex having a Friday wobble, two wickets gone in the first half hour. Gloucestershire are having one of those mornings, the eighth wicket goes with the lead only 35. Sussex, who were jeered at by a rather pathetic bunch of home fans before the summer break, could be about to pull the rabbit out of the hat. On his fiftieth birthday, Shane Warne makes one of his most important contributions to cricket, speaking out on the climate crisis. A wicket with the fourth ball of the day for Chris Jordan down at Bristol, Jack Taylor for ten. Gloucestershire\u2019s lead is just 30. Follow all the latest at the Test with our crack team of OBOers. We could pass the time BTL on what will be a quietish day by chewing on our pencils to come up with 16s for the men\u2019s winter tour parties: New Zealand in November for five T20s and two Tests; then a mega-tour of South Africa from December to February consisting of four Tests, three ODIs and three T20s. Division One: Warwickshire 517; Essex 278-6. Essex trail by 239 runs with four wickets remaining (first innings). Division Two: Gloucestershire 200 &amp; 197-6; Sussex 370. Gloucs lead by 27 runs with four wickets remaining (second innings). Division Two: Leicestershire 308 &amp; 189; Northants 357 &amp; 22-0. Northants need 119 runs to win. Division One: Hampshire (149 &amp; 436) beat Surrey (162 &amp; 151) by 272 runs. Kent (304 &amp; 259) beat Nottinghamshire (124 &amp; 212) by 227 runs. Somerset (199 &amp; 329) beat Yorkshire (103-9 &amp; 127-9) by 298 runs. Division Two: Middlesex (143 &amp; 151) beat Durham (147 &amp; 191) by 44 runs. Lancashire (418) beat Derbyshire (244 &amp; 129) by an innings and 45 runs. Worcestershire (205 &amp; 299) beat Glamorgan (193 &amp; 156) by 155 runs. Good morning! from this final day of the-round-before-the-penultimate-round of the season, where just three games are still breathing. As it was ordained, the day has dawned brightly in Manchester now that Lancashire have returned to the bright lights of Division One, thanks to a thumping win over Derbyshire yesterday.

      "body": "<p>My friend Clifford Bartlett, who has died aged 79, was a music librarian and editor, and a reviewer and publisher of early music. He became the go-to person for everyone seeking advice on how to obtain and perform music from the middle ages to the 19th century.</p> <p>Clifford was born in London, the son of Alfred Bartlett, a builder and, latterly, surveyor for Lewisham borough council, and Nora (nee Hiskey), who also worked for Lewisham council.

      "body": "<p>The sensation has become so rare, it took a moment to realise what it was. But following Wednesday\u2019s ruling by Scotland\u2019s highest civil court that Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/scottish-judges-rule-boris-johnsons-prorogation-unlawful\" title=\"\">unlawful</a>, the feeling was unmistakable. It was optimism. Admittedly, it was optimism in its weakest form: not the confident certainty that all would turn out for the best, but rather a fragile flicker of hope that things might not be so bad after all.</p> <p>Coupled with MPs\u2019 success in both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/cornered-boris-johnson-suffers-triple-commons-defeat\" title=\"\">outlawing</a> a no-deal crash-out from the European Union on 31 October and forcing the release of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/operation-yellowhammer-fears-no-deal-brexit-chaos-forced-to-publish-secret-papers\" title=\"\">Yellowhammer papers</a> outlining the government\u2019s own assessment of the calamity such a Brexit would inflict on the country, a hopeful thought took root. Maybe, just maybe, the British constitution was working as the textbooks say it should. Here was an independent judiciary and independent legislature doing their jobs: acting as a restraint on an overmighty executive.</p> <p>For once, we could draw a happy contrast between ourselves and others. For a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/30/trump-us-constitution-weakness-founding-fathers\" title=\"\">sobering lesson</a> from the convulsions of the post-2016 era is that constitutions, written or unwritten, are only as strong as the people charged with enforcing them. The Republicans in the US Congress have failed that test, refusing to do their duty by restraining a president bent on trampling on the constitution. In the last fortnight, Britain\u2019s politicians \u2013 or enough of them \u2013 have shown their US counterparts how it\u2019s done.</p> <p>Labour deserves credit for resisting the temptation to give Johnson the early election date he wanted, but the striking act of political courage was committed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/what-have-tory-rebels-voted-for-and-will-an-election-now-happen\" title=\"\">21 Tory rebels</a> who were prepared to sacrifice their careers, and break decades-long bonds of allegiance, to stop their party leader driving the country off a cliff. Surely their bravery justifies what one of those rebel leaders, Dominic Grieve, calls a \u201c<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">quiet optimism</a>\u201d \u2013 proof that while our constitution is currently being tested to its very limits, so far it is, despite everything, coming through.</p> <p>I wish I could say that. But we need to gird ourselves for a possible reversal of the Scottish decision in the UK supreme court on Tuesday. If, as plenty of legal scholars fear, those judges rule that Johnson\u2019s prorogation, or suspension, of parliament was cynical, unjustified and dishonest but not ultimately illegal, parliament will remain shut.</p> <p>That would be more than just another setback in a journey that has been full of them. For, as Prof Meg Russell of UCL\u2019s Constitution Unit puts it: \u201cThe political constitution cannot operate properly if parliament is not sitting.\u201d Under our system, parliamentary sovereignty is the whole shooting match: it <em>is</em> the constitution. \u201cIf you shut parliament, it\u2019s very hard to say your constitution is working.\u201d</p> <p>Look at those recent rebel achievements, on both Yellowhammer and the Brexit extension. They required great ingenuity, organisation and cross-party cooperation, as well as a Speaker with a strong bias in favour of parliament against government. But above all they required parliament to be in session. If the doors of the Commons are shut, all those levers are gone. It\u2019s not just that Grieve and friends can no longer perform legislative acrobatics in the chamber. The whole apparatus of scrutiny will have been dismantled. No departmental questions that might expose gaps in no-deal preparations; no select committees to hear evidence; no urgent questions, a tool that Speaker Bercow allowed to be used to powerful effect. Above all, MPs will have been deprived of their most critical weapon: if parliament is not sitting, it cannot table a vote of no confidence in the government. Recall that Johnson has lost six out of seven votes he has faced in the House of Commons; his majority is down to minus 43.</p> <p>It seems likely that, were it tested, Johnson would not enjoy the confidence of MPs. And yet, while parliament is suspended it has no way of expressing that verdict. Fear not, comes the reply. Parliament will be back on 14 October and can assert itself then. But if the supreme court rules the suspension is legal, what\u2019s to stop Johnson doing it again, shutting parliament for another two weeks to take him past the no-deal deadline? He could then cheerfully defy the law by refusing to apply for an EU extension, for who would enforce it? The courts cannot remove him from office. Grieve has no army. The only mechanism, a no-confidence vote, cannot be exercised if parliament is closed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eafb73a051c4cadd4bdc066539e43f2737f81c7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eafb73a051c4cadd4bdc066539e43f2737f81c7e/0_56_2555_1534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings leave from the rear of Downing Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Why do Cummings and Johnson think they can get away with it?

In an interview (\u00a3) with the Times before For The Record hits bookshop shelves, the former prime minister explained how he thinks about losing the referendum \u201cevery single day\u201d and what the consequences will be. He also says a second referendum may be necessary to break the deadlock, criticises Johnson\u2019s move to prorogue parliament and accuses him of \u201csharp practices\u201d in stripping 21 Tory MPs of the whip for rebelling. In the interview, part of a publicity drive to launch the book, Cameron says the campaign left him feeling like he was caught \u201cin a quagmire\u201d.

His harsh appraisal of his former colleagues comes amid a crisis for the Tories in which long-standing members have criticised the party for its perceived lurch to the right and its take-over by no-deal Brexiters. Speaking from his London home, Cameron told his interviewer, Andrew Billen, that the 2016 referendum turned into a \u201cterrible Tory psychodrama\u201d and his message was unable to cut through. \u201cI think about this every day.

      "body": "<p>Famously, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il only ever played one game of golf. In 1994 state media reported Kim had picked up a club for the first time at the country\u2019s only golf course. Happily he took to the sport instantly, completing his debut round in a world-record 38 under par with 11 holes in one. At which point he announced he was retiring from golf and would never play again.</p> <p>It is of course a terrible blow for golf to lose such a talent, and tantalising to imagine just how good the Supreme Commander Of The People\u2019s Army could have become. Worse, there is no recording of the round, just the sworn testimony of his 17 bodyguards that it definitely, like, happened. Plus of course Kim had a wide brief of other interests to cram in, among these composing six full opera scores, all of which are, according to state records, \u201cbetter than any other in history\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/11/international-football-10-talking-points-from-the-latest-round-of-games\">International football: 10 talking points from the latest round of games</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps it\u2019s just me, but as time has passed there has been something of the dictator-propaganda machine about the endless slew of Ronaldo-Messi facts and stats and milestones. You know the kind of thing. Six hundred goals. Fifty hat-tricks. Threw an apple over a petrol station. Only man to score simultaneously on a single day against every single team in the league.</p> <p>Gorging on this, cramming in great dripping handfuls of left-footed assists in a calendar year, or the fact that more people follow Cristiano Ronaldo on Instagram than have ever died in the whole of human history, you can grow a little dizzy. Why not a thousand goals? Why not a million goals? Worse, the thought occurs that these Ronaldo-Messi numbers are not robust, that they\u2019re products of a moment in football history when money, talent-hoarding and changes in the rules have made it possible to dominate completely, ushering in this stream of super-numbers, all of them better than all the other numbers from times when such numbers were impossible.</p> <p>Except, of course, this isn\u2019t quite right. Every now and then a stat crops up that really does take the breath away, a reminder that there is a cold hard edge of genius at work here. This week brought one of those. On Tuesday night Ronaldo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/10/euro-2020-qualifying-roundup-cristiano-ronaldo-portugal-france-serbia-czech-republic\" title=\"\">scored four goals for Portugal in Vilnius</a> to break Robbie Keane\u2019s Euro qualifier goals record. More exciting still, Ronaldo is now on 93 international goals, 16 behind Ali Daei\u2019s all-time international mark for Iran.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ronaldo and Messi are simply stand-alone superstars, a brilliant fluke of all-time talent in the same time and space</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Watching him against Lithuania he still looks like the same old Ronaldo, the same old snake-hipped robot-replicant physique, the sense of a man-sized wedding cake figurine miraculously come to life. The actual goals were pretty ragged: a penalty; a triple-layered fluke (slip, bobble, deflection); a tap-in from a lovely pass by Bernardo Silva; and a classy late sidefoot.</p> <p>Clearly Portugal will waltz through qualifying. Next up are Luxembourg twice, Ukraine and Lithuania at home. At this rate Ronaldo could end up passing the 100 goal mark before the end of the year, and then hauling in the all-time record at next year\u2019s Euros.

      "bodyText": "Famously, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il only ever played one game of golf. In 1994 state media reported Kim had picked up a club for the first time at the country\u2019s only golf course. Happily he took to the sport instantly, completing his debut round in a world-record 38 under par with 11 holes in one. At which point he announced he was retiring from golf and would never play again. It is of course a terrible blow for golf to lose such a talent, and tantalising to imagine just how good the Supreme Commander Of The People\u2019s Army could have become. Worse, there is no recording of the round, just the sworn testimony of his 17 bodyguards that it definitely, like, happened. Plus of course Kim had a wide brief of other interests to cram in, among these composing six full opera scores, all of which are, according to state records, \u201cbetter than any other in history\u201d. Perhaps it\u2019s just me, but as time has passed there has been something of the dictator-propaganda machine about the endless slew of Ronaldo-Messi facts and stats and milestones. You know the kind of thing. Six hundred goals. Fifty hat-tricks. Threw an apple over a petrol station. Only man to score simultaneously on a single day against every single team in the league. Gorging on this, cramming in great dripping handfuls of left-footed assists in a calendar year, or the fact that more people follow Cristiano Ronaldo on Instagram than have ever died in the whole of human history, you can grow a little dizzy. Why not a thousand goals? Why not a million goals? Worse, the thought occurs that these Ronaldo-Messi numbers are not robust, that they\u2019re products of a moment in football history when money, talent-hoarding and changes in the rules have made it possible to dominate completely, ushering in this stream of super-numbers, all of them better than all the other numbers from times when such numbers were impossible. Except, of course, this isn\u2019t quite right. Every now and then a stat crops up that really does take the breath away, a reminder that there is a cold hard edge of genius at work here. This week brought one of those. On Tuesday night Ronaldo scored four goals for Portugal in Vilnius to break Robbie Keane\u2019s Euro qualifier goals record. More exciting still, Ronaldo is now on 93 international goals, 16 behind Ali Daei\u2019s all-time international mark for Iran. Watching him against Lithuania he still looks like the same old Ronaldo, the same old snake-hipped robot-replicant physique, the sense of a man-sized wedding cake figurine miraculously come to life. The actual goals were pretty ragged: a penalty; a triple-layered fluke (slip, bobble, deflection); a tap-in from a lovely pass by Bernardo Silva; and a classy late sidefoot. Clearly Portugal will waltz through qualifying. Next up are Luxembourg twice, Ukraine and Lithuania at home. At this rate Ronaldo could end up passing the 100 goal mark before the end of the year, and then hauling in the all-time record at next year\u2019s Euros. It is a startling prospect, if only because it is such a funny record for Ronaldo to break, a brilliantly literal-minded notion of greatness. \u201cI\u2019m going to score more goals than anyone else ever! This will mean that I\u2019m the best!\u201d And oddly enough, perhaps it might, if only because this is such an unusual, out-there feat in modern football. Just look at the top 10: Ali Daei, Kunishige Kamamoto, Godfrey Chitalu, Hussein Saeed, Bashar Abdullah, Sunil Chhetri. Add in Pel\u00e9, Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis. And now you know who.

Crew, who is deputy chief constable of Avon and Somerset police, states that \u201cthe meeting was positive and the DPP listened to the issues raised\u201d.</p> <p>It is understood that many officers who specialise in the investigation of rape have become increasingly concerned that prosecutors have raised the bar for evidence in rape cases, meaning that cases \u2013 especially those involving the most vulnerable witnesses \u2013 have become less likely to reach court.</p> <p>Last September the Guardian revealed that CPS leaders had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/sep/24/prosecutors-rape-cases-cps-crown-prosecution-service-conviction-rates\">carried out a series of unpublicised training </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/sep/24/prosecutors-rape-cases-cps-crown-prosecution-service-conviction-rates\">\u201croadshows\u201d</a> encouraging the removal of hundreds of \u201cweak rape cases\u201d. Concerns were raised that it had shifted away from the \u201cmerits-based approach\u201d of prosecuting, which requires prosecutors to make decisions guided by the quality of the evidence rather than by a perception of how a prejudiced jury might respond to evidence.</p> <p>A far-reaching review into how the criminal justice system deals with rape was announced in March after a steep fall in the number of prosecutions and warnings that victims are routinely having their privacy violated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/24/dame-vera-baird-sparks-row-over-case-police-phone-searches\">intrusive disclosure practices</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jul/26/rape-cases-charge-summons-prosecutions-victims-england-wales\">most recent Home Office statistics</a> highlight an alarming decline in rape prosecutions in England and Wales over recent years at a time when victims are reporting more attacks. <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2019-07-12/276572/\">Ministry of Justice figures</a> also reveal that victims of sexual assault are being forced to wait longer to secure justice in the crown court.</p> <p>Sarah Green, the director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said it \u201cstrongly believed\u201d the CPS had switched to a more conservative approach. \u201cWhat have police forces been feeding back to Sarah Crew, and what are police experiencing on the ground to make them raise this question?\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to remember the deeply serious human rights implications of this \u2013 women reporting rape are less likely to get justice and offenders may be getting away with their crimes.\u201d</p> <p>An NPCC spokesperson said: \u201cWe are not saying there is a risk-averse approach, but that this needs to be examined as part of the end-to-end government review we are all actively engaged in.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement following the release of the figures, Crew said they reflected \u201ca justice system that is stretched and under pressure\u201d. The \u201chuge increase\u201d of digital evidence was also \u201cextending the length and complexity of investigations\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Crew told the Today programme on Friday the review also had to look at whether both the police and CPS had become more risk averse.</p> <p>\u201cBoth the investigators and the prosecutors want to prosecute these cases,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A CPS spokesperson said the criminal justice system was working to understand and address the \u201ccomplex reasons\u201d behind the drop in referrals, charges and convictions.</p> <p>\u201cRape is a devastating crime, and it would be profoundly wrong to take a risk-averse approach to its prosecution.\u201d The spokesperson said the director of public prosecutions repeated this message in his meeting with Crew, \u201cin which he was clear that there should be no risk-averse approach. Every case must be judged on its merits and whenever the legal test is met, it will be robustly prosecuted.\u201d</p>",

The Guardian has also found the proportion of cases charged by the CPS decreased in every police force area even where referrals had increased, except Derbyshire where it remained flat, between 2013-14 and 2018-19. In the NPCC letter, sent out to officers in June, Crew states that she and the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Nick Ephgrave met Hill to discuss the current comprehensive criminal justice review into rape. During the meeting Crew told specialist rape police officers that she had raised \u201cthemes emerging from engagement with forces on issues which may be relevant\u201d to the review, including \u201capproach to charging rape and serious sexual assault cases \u2013 a move to a more risk-averse approach\u201d, \u201ceffective communication\u201d, and \u201cchallenges in accessibility and timeliness in some areas\u201d. The letter also acknowledges \u201cinconsistency in both police and CPS approaches\u201d to disclosure \u2013 the practice of ensuring that all evidence in a case is made available to defence lawyers before trial. Crew, who is deputy chief constable of Avon and Somerset police, states that \u201cthe meeting was positive and the DPP listened to the issues raised\u201d. It is understood that many officers who specialise in the investigation of rape have become increasingly concerned that prosecutors have raised the bar for evidence in rape cases, meaning that cases \u2013 especially those involving the most vulnerable witnesses \u2013 have become less likely to reach court. Last September the Guardian revealed that CPS leaders had carried out a series of unpublicised training \u201croadshows\u201d encouraging the removal of hundreds of \u201cweak rape cases\u201d. Concerns were raised that it had shifted away from the \u201cmerits-based approach\u201d of prosecuting, which requires prosecutors to make decisions guided by the quality of the evidence rather than by a perception of how a prejudiced jury might respond to evidence. A far-reaching review into how the criminal justice system deals with rape was announced in March after a steep fall in the number of prosecutions and warnings that victims are routinely having their privacy violated with intrusive disclosure practices. The most recent Home Office statistics highlight an alarming decline in rape prosecutions in England and Wales over recent years at a time when victims are reporting more attacks. Ministry of Justice figures also reveal that victims of sexual assault are being forced to wait longer to secure justice in the crown court. Sarah Green, the director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said it \u201cstrongly believed\u201d the CPS had switched to a more conservative approach. \u201cWhat have police forces been feeding back to Sarah Crew, and what are police experiencing on the ground to make them raise this question?\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to remember the deeply serious human rights implications of this \u2013 women reporting rape are less likely to get justice and offenders may be getting away with their crimes.\u201d An NPCC spokesperson said: \u201cWe are not saying there is a risk-averse approach, but that this needs to be examined as part of the end-to-end government review we are all actively engaged in.\u201d In a statement following the release of the figures, Crew said they reflected \u201ca justice system that is stretched and under pressure\u201d. The \u201chuge increase\u201d of digital evidence was also \u201cextending the length and complexity of investigations\u201d, she said. Crew told the Today programme on Friday the review also had to look at whether both the police and CPS had become more risk averse. \u201cBoth the investigators and the prosecutors want to prosecute these cases,\u201d she said. A CPS spokesperson said the criminal justice system was working to understand and address the \u201ccomplex reasons\u201d behind the drop in referrals, charges and convictions. \u201cRape is a devastating crime, and it would be profoundly wrong to take a risk-averse approach to its prosecution.\u201d The spokesperson said the director of public prosecutions repeated this message in his meeting with Crew, \u201cin which he was clear that there should be no risk-averse approach. Every case must be judged on its merits and whenever the legal test is met, it will be robustly prosecuted.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Benjamin Netanyahu remains neck and neck with his main election challenger after a widely condemned vow to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, before a vote that could bring an end to his time as Israeli prime minister. In the last polls before election day on Tuesday, neither Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party or the opposition Blue and White alliance, run by his former army chief Benny Gantz, appeared to have a clear route to the premiership. Both would have to make deals with smaller parties to form a government, meaning the result of the vote could kick off weeks of political negotiations before it is clear who will be Israel\u2019s next leader. Fearing the end of his more than 13-year tenure \u2013 the longest of any Israeli leader \u2013 Netanyahu has made divisive and potentially explosive promises in the dying days of the campaign. On Tuesday he vowed to extend Israeli sovereignty over Jewish settlements and up to a third of the occupied West Bank if he is re-elected. If carried out, the plan would trap more than 2.5 million Palestinians in dislocated enclaves surrounded by Israel. The move, for decades considered an endgame scenario for Palestinians\u2019 aspirations of statehood, was condemned by Arab countries, the UN and the EU as an illegal land grab. Netanyahu is battling for his political survival, and the announcement was interpreted as a rallying cry to his hardline rightwing base. Gantz has said he also supports annexation and accused Netanyahu of stealing his idea. \u201cWe are happy that Netanyahu has come around to adopt the Blue and White plan to recognise the Jordan Valley,\u201d he said. Dahlia Scheindlin, a Tel-Aviv based political analyst and a public opinion expert, said annexation was popular with the rightwing voters Netanyahu was courting. \u201cOverall, Israeli support for sovereignty in the West Bank is substantial,\u201d the pollster wrote. She said Netanyahu\u2019s stance that not a single Palestinian living there would be given citizenship \u2013 and therefore voting rights \u2013 was critical to the support. \u201cThe public only unites against annexation when they realise Palestinians swept up in sovereignty might be equal to Israelis,\u201d she said. The Likud party has equally focused on Israel\u2019s internal Arab minority, Palestinians who managed to stay on their land during Israel\u2019s creation in 1948 and now account for up to a fifth of the population. Netanyahu sought to pass legislation this month that would allow political parties to put cameras in polling stations \u2013 a move condemned as voter intimidation, especially against Arabs. Netanyahu has also warned, without evidence, that his opponents are trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election. And on Thursday Facebook temporarily shut down a chatbot on Netanyahu\u2019s official page after it breached the company\u2019s hate speech policy by sending visitors a message warning of Arabs who \u201cwant to destroy us all\u201d. Netanyahu used similar tactics in previous elections, particularly in 2015 when he claimed that Arabs were voting \u201cin droves\u201d. A columnist for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper said the Facebook scandal, however, was the nadir of what was \u201cthe nastiest, most racist campaign ever\u201d. \u201cThe plunge to the bottom of the sewer, the dive into the depths of the morass that we\u2019ve seen in the past few weeks \u2013 it has all come straight from the top,\u201d wrote Yossi Verter. Tuesday\u2019s vote will be the second election held in five months after a political crisis in May scuppered the newly elected Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament. Netanyahu appeared to have won the ballot in April when he and rightwing parliamentary allies came out ahead. However, his attempts to form a coalition government failed over disagreements between Jewish ultra-Orthodox parties and secular politicians. Avigdor Lieberman, a former defence minister and leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu party, had sought guarantees that ultra-Orthodox religious students, who are largely exempt from conscription, would be forced to serve in the army. Eventually, Netanyahu forced the Knesset to dissolve, triggering repeat elections and giving him another chance. Lieberman, a Netanyahu ally-turned-rival, appears to be the biggest beneficiary of the second election. His public dispute with religious leaders has led to a jump in popularity, and it seems he could gather enough seats to become a kingmaker. Analysts are predicting a relatively low turnout this time around, with voters not keen on having two elections in one year. Netanyahu published a poll on Twitter on Friday that showed Blue and White marginally ahead. \u201cAnyone who wants a rightwing government must go out and vote,\u201d he said.

A Thursday report by the news outlet Politico, which cited US officials as saying Israel was likely to have planted spying devices near the White House, has also come at a bad time for Netanyahu as it raises the prospect of adding tension to US-Israeli relations. Both Israel and the US have officially denied the claims.",

He strengthened his grip on the Tour of Britain and, after his stage win in Kendal on Tuesday, cemented his status as one of the favourites for the world road race championships in Harrogate on 28 September. After a circuitous 185km from Warwick \u2013 essentially a very large lap of Coventry \u2013 the stage boiled down to the last of three ascents of the mile-long climb to this landmark in the heart of England, where the crowds perched on a sun-bleached hilltop by an extinct windmill and a former Anglo-Saxon cemetery. The British national champion, Ben Swift, and the Norwegian Amund Gr\u00f8ndal Jansen made an initial surge forward after crossing the cattle grid at the foot of the climb, only for Van der Poel to burst through between the pair, with only one rider able to hold the flying Dutchman.

tomorrow. </p> \n  <p>Kant\u00e9 has missed Chelsea\u2019s last two games with an ankle injury and the trip to Molineux has come too soon for the midfielder, who faces a race against time to be fit for next week\u2019s Champions League game against Valencia at Stamford Bridge. </p> \n  <p>\u201cN\u2019Golo is not fit yet,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cHe still has issues with his ankle. The medical team are working with him. He is in a transition period and we are trying to get him on the pitch. He is doing some physical work but this game comes too soon for him. \u201cHopefully he is close. I don\u2019t want to jump the gun because we are waiting for improvements for that final step to get him where we want him to be on the pitch. Hopefully that will be in the next week or so.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The good news for Chelsea is that Mateo Kovacic, Pedro and Antonio Rudiger are fit after shaking off injuries, but Emerson Palmieri is a doubt with the thigh problem he picked up on international duty. Meanwhile Callum Hudson-Odoi, who is close to signing a new deal, and Reece James will make their comebacks from long-term injuries when they play for the Under-23s tonight. </p> \n  <p>\u201cCallum is going to play for the 23s this evening along with Reece James,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cThey will get minutes and it\u2019s important now because Callum has been training with us for a while but there are still issues that we need to make sure are OK with the injury itself, in terms of the strength and where the injury is. He\u2019ll need to get match fit, which is why these games are really beneficial for him. It will be great to see that.</p> \n  <p>\u201cReece James is similar, not such a long time out but he needs games for similar reasons. I\u2019m pleased with that. They are two young players that are going to be big for this club going forward and we\u2019ll all be watching tonight.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-13T12:10:21.249Z\">at 1.10pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7b83348f08f30dc5bbabef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-13T11:54:48.242Z\">12.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Roy\u2019s rope-a-dope plan for Spurs</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CPFC/status/1172473708612595712\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udde3 Roy on away record: \u201cWe are often tight at the back and away from home, spaces often open up when teams start to chase the game.\"<br><br>\ud83d\udcbb <a href=\"https://t.co/TTogt6KZzQ\">https://t.co/TTogt6KZzQ</a><br>\ud83d\udcf1 Official club app<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CPFC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CPFC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fXUPLpnjyU\">pic.twitter.com/fXUPLpnjyU</a></p>\u2014 Crystal Palace F.C.

Well, up to a point. Watford being Watford, only six of the players Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores managed in his previous spell are still on the scene so it may take time before he is fully reacquainted with the place he describes as \u201cmy home\u201d. It was no surprise Watford\u2019s owners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/07/watford-sack-head-coach-javi-gracia-after-poor-start-to-the-season\">blinked at the first sign of trouble</a> for Javi Gracia and it would take some bravery to predict Flores\u2019s return lasting longer than his previous 11-and-a-half-month tenure. He has a tough job and, given Manchester City await after Arsenal, things may deteriorate before he can steady the ship. Even if he is not familiar with most of his new charges yet, one of them knows Sunday\u2019s opponents especially well. Danny Welbeck was eased back by Gracia, having missed most of last season. But 90 minutes in last month\u2019s League Cup win over Coventry boded well and a fortnight\u2019s training over the international break cannot have hurt. Giving Welbeck his first start might be the early masterstroke Flores needs; if one ex has come back to help Watford, another could boost their cause by downing his former employers. <br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/13/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7b65fb8f083106f455addf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-13T09:49:04.186Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Quiz!

Wilfried Zaha sacked his agent over failing to get to Tottenham, it has been reported, so Saturday offers chance for him to look longingly at what he could have won. And there were whispers that Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo might have been a contender for Chelsea so his Wolves team have a chance to show their manager\u2019s credentials.

      "bodyText": "That will be all from us for today. Thanks for following today\u2019s updates - there will be plenty more where this came from over the weekend, starting with Newcastle\u2019s visit to Liverpool in tomorrow\u2019s early kick-off. See you soon! Can Roy Hodgson mastermind another rousing away victory for Crystal Palace - this time against Tottenham Hotspur? Dominic Fifield thinks it over: Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says he hopes in-form Raheem Sterling won\u2019t read too much of the positive press he\u2019s receiving after some sparkling recent displays for club and country. \u201cIt would be good for him,\u201d insists the Spaniard. Watch the video: More match previews ahoy: Southampton manager Ralph Hassenhuttl has sensationally \u2018revealed\u2019 that he took his players on a sailing trip during the international break, telling the club\u2019s website: In the first week we didn\u2019t have so many players here, but we tried to work out on the pitch, and we had one very good team event where we went sailing. I think the players enjoyed it, it was fantastic weather, and we took the time to have a good team event. I think it\u2019s always interesting for the players to do some things that are not very normal. To go together on the boat and work hard was fun, and I think they enjoyed it. There\u2019s no doubt Hassenhuttl steadied Saints\u2019 ship after being appointed last season. Fans will be hoping they\u2019re not all at sea come next May. Oh, in team news, Michael Obafemi and Ryan Bertrand are both fit again for the trip to Sheffield United, but Nathan Redmond is still out with an ankle injury. Defender Kevin Danso is suspended, while Moussa Djenepo may be fit to make his first start for the club. Neymar is in line for a return in front of the PSG faithful for the first time since his summer dalliance with former club Barcelona. Ahead of the Ligue 1 meeting with Strasbourg tomorrow, manager Thomas Tuchel said: \u201cHe\u2019s ready to play. I understand that not all supporters are happy at the moment with the situation [after Neymar was heavily linked with Bar\u00e7a] but I cannot influence that reaction, I can\u2019t control it. \u201cWhen you [the media] talk about it all the time, you make it much more important than it is. Nothing in life is so important.\u201d Sorry, Thomas. It won\u2019t happen again. (It will.) Klopp celebrates that Manager of the Month gong Aston Villa\u2019s Jonathan Kodjia will be out for \u2018two-three weeks\u2019 with a fractured cheekbone, says manager Dean Smith. Kodjia and Marvelous Nakamba accidentally clashed heads in training, and Kodjia had an operation after the fracture was detected. Smith said: \u201cHe just clashed heads with Marvelous in a non-competitive part of training. \u201cWe thought it was fine but they picked up a fracture at the hospital and he\u2019s had an operation which means he will be out for two-three weeks. \u201cHe will come back initially non-contact and then we will have to see how he goes.\u201d \u201cThere will be a few debuts, perhaps,\u201d says Norwich City boss Daniel Farke as he weighs up a selection from an injury-hit squad for the visit of Manchester City tomorrow evening. \u201cFor instance Adam Idah ... it could be that he\u2019s involved tomorrow. This brings the group together, it\u2019s a chance for some other lads to shine.\u201d Cork-born 18-year-old forward Idah has represented Ireland from under-16 to under-21 level, but is yet to make his Premier League bow for the Canaries after signing in 2017. \u201cWe won\u2019t cry, it\u2019s tricky, but we will try to search for some solutions,\u201d Farke added. Bad news for Liverpool fans - Alisson will remain sidelined until the middle of next month: Arsenal have just announced that striker Alexandre Lacazette will be sidelined until next month with an ankle problem he\u2019s recently been battling against. A story on the Arsenal website reads: After assessments to an ongoing ankle issue, we have advised that Alex will need to rest and strengthen his ankle to regain full fitness. Alex has been playing through this injury for several weeks. He is likely to be back in action in October. Steve Bruce and Newcastle have a bit of positive team news as a counterpoint to the Sean Longstaff injury we mentioned earlier. Bruce says Matt Ritchie is making a \u2018remarkable\u2019 recovery after being on the end of a strong challenge by Leicester\u2019s Hamza Choudhury recently: He\u2019s shocked us all. We weren\u2019t expecting to see him for at least a couple of months. The way he trained yesterday and the day before - as long he doesn\u2019t have any reaction - then I don\u2019t think he\u2019s very far away so that\u2019s good news to us. Arsenal can see light at the end of the tunnel where their injury problems are concerned although Sunday\u2019s match at Watford will come too soon for H\u00e9ctor Bellerin, Kieran Tierney and Rob Holding. Of the two full-backs, who are both back in training, Unai Emery said this afternoon that they are \u201cnow closer to us\u201d and will probably play at least one under-23 game to \u201ctake confidence and better their rhythm\u201d. Holding is further ahead in his recovery from a cruciate injury, having already played some under-23 football, but Emery suggested he needs more minutes at that level. Emery confirmed Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 will be fit to play at Vicarage Road despite pulling out of Ivory Coast\u2019s squad that faced Benin and Tunisia, and revealed that he will take a final decision on the identity of Arsenal\u2019s captain for the season next week. Full story on that injury to Aymeric Laporte. More Zinedine Zidane. On Luka Modric, who suffered a thigh injury playing for Croatia. Luka has had two games in three days and now we can\u2019t think about that anymore. I hope Luka recovers quickly for us. He is injured, cannot play tomorrow and we must accept that. We are without Modric but there are also some players who are coming back in. The squad is what we have got, there are no more changes and we have got a lot of players. Everyone will have their chance to contribute to the team. Injuries happens to every club, especially at the beginning of the season. We have lot of players who never stop because they are internationals. We work well and I trust the people who work here, they are the best, but injuries happen. I hope that after Luka we don\u2019t have more injured players, but it could happen. On Gareth Bale, back in from the cold: He is happy now and so am I. We have to pull forward now. Gareth is one of my players and it\u2019s my philosophy to believe in all of my players. We are all guilty of the things we do right and wrong. We are in the same boat. More injury news: Norwich defender Max Aarons will be out until the next international break - mid-October - with the ankle injury he sustained during an England U21 game this week. \u201cHis foot is still in a boot,\u201d said Daniel Farke. Jamie Jackson on the doubts around Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r at Manchester United. More Klopp, on Alisson and Naby Ke\u00efta. On Alisson: \u201cHe\u2019s improving but we cannot put any pressure on it. It was a really serious injury in the calf and it\u2019s now much better. That\u2019s good for us and good for him but we don\u2019t know exactly. The target was always after the next international break he could be ready but we don\u2019t know. Hopefully everything will be fine for the rest of the season, that\u2019s the plan.\u201d On Ke\u00efta, who has not played since the Community Shield because of a hip/groin injury: \u201cNaby is close. He could be in training when we come back from Napoli next week.\u201d More Pep: \u201c[Benjamin] Mendy is good. His knee is reacting well so hopefully in the next few games. We want to be careful and sure when he starts to play.\u201d Ilkay Gundogan has recovered from a stomach bug and Gabriel Jesus is fit and in contention this weekend. Guardiola also confirmed that central defender John Stones is fit but he is expecting Aymeric Laporte to be out for \u201ca long time, five or six months\u201d. Quick spot of Liverpool team news. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has just held his press conference. Eden Hazard is set to make his Real Madrid debut against Levante on Saturday and Zinedine Zidane, under a bit of pressure and coming in for pelters from members of the Spanish press who have Florentino P\u00e9rez\u2019s phone number, has been talking. There\u2019s a lot of pressure, a lot of expectations. We know the situation. He is ready, and that\u2019s the most important thing. We all want to see Eden, to see what happens. We have to go slowly, he was injured for three weeks, he has been back for a week. We have seven games in 21 days and we\u2019re going to have to take it easy. It will be up to me to measure his minutes and his playing time, because we need him for a long time, for several matches, not just for one. Important piece from Eni Aluko. Injury news for Manchester City; John Stones is back, though. Leroy San\u00e9 back December-January-February, says Pep, a little mysteriously. Glad somebody noticed. Per PA Media: West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini believes everyone must respect Declan Rice\u2019s decision over his international future. The Hammers midfielder, 20, revealed his switch from the Republic of Ireland to England led to threats against him and his family in some vitriolic online abuse. Rice made his fifth senior appearance for the Three Lions in the Euro 2020 qualifier against Kosovo, and Pellegrini feels it is time to move on. \u201cI think Declan delayed his decision and had a think and a talk with the people important to him so I don\u2019t have any doubt that it was the right decision Declan took for his life,\u201d the West Ham manager said at a press conference. \u201cOf course, not everybody is happy, but everyone has to respect him for that and he shouldn\u2019t give them too much importance because it doesn\u2019t matter what other people think.\u201d More previews... Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r isn\u2019t enjoying much sunshine. Frank Lampard has said Chelsea will still be without N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 when they visit Wolves tomorrow. Kant\u00e9 has missed Chelsea\u2019s last two games with an ankle injury and the trip to Molineux has come too soon for the midfielder, who faces a race against time to be fit for next week\u2019s Champions League game against Valencia at Stamford Bridge. \u201cN\u2019Golo is not fit yet,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cHe still has issues with his ankle. The medical team are working with him. He is in a transition period and we are trying to get him on the pitch. He is doing some physical work but this game comes too soon for him. \u201cHopefully he is close. I don\u2019t want to jump the gun because we are waiting for improvements for that final step to get him where we want him to be on the pitch. Hopefully that will be in the next week or so.\u201d The good news for Chelsea is that Mateo Kovacic, Pedro and Antonio Rudiger are fit after shaking off injuries, but Emerson Palmieri is a doubt with the thigh problem he picked up on international duty. Meanwhile Callum Hudson-Odoi, who is close to signing a new deal, and Reece James will make their comebacks from long-term injuries when they play for the Under-23s tonight. \u201cCallum is going to play for the 23s this evening along with Reece James,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cThey will get minutes and it\u2019s important now because Callum has been training with us for a while but there are still issues that we need to make sure are OK with the injury itself, in terms of the strength and where the injury is. He\u2019ll need to get match fit, which is why these games are really beneficial for him. It will be great to see that. \u201cReece James is similar, not such a long time out but he needs games for similar reasons. I\u2019m pleased with that. They are two young players that are going to be big for this club going forward and we\u2019ll all be watching tonight.\u201d Roy\u2019s rope-a-dope plan for Spurs Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has been speaking to media ahead of his side\u2019s visit to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in north London. \u201cIf we come away tomorrow with points, we\u2019ve got to give an exceptional performance at both ends of the field,\u201d Hodgson said. It\u2019s only three weeks since the Eagles emerged from Old Trafford with three points, so victory against Spurs is hardly beyond them. Team news-wise, Hodgson confirmed that defender Martin Kelly and striker Connor Wickham are both sidelined by injury, added to which \u201cthere are a couple of people we need to assess in the morning\u201d. Scott Dann and James McArthur are the two players whose fitness remains in question. If you missed it, yesterday\u2019s edition of The Fiver led on the disagreement between Napoli and their builders: manager Carlo Ancelotti insisting he had \u2018no words\u2019 for the failure to finish changing rooms at the San Paolo in good time for their first home fixture of the season against Sampdoria tomorrow. Rumours on the ground in Naples, however, are suggesting it\u2019s all part of a cunning plan by club owner Aurelio De Laurentiis, who wants to purchase the stadium from the city, and is keen to paint their management of the venue as inadequate. The plot will no doubt thicken. When it does, we\u2019ll have it in The Fiver, so sign up now! Pochettino on Ryan Sessegnon, whose Tottenham career is yet to get under way. You can be a very good player, but you need a platform, team-mates and good coaching staff to help you. Then you need time and luck and training hard and hard work. Sometimes the people don\u2019t realise that for a player with talent to have a good career and be successful you need a platform. Tottenham, I hope, will provide that platform. It\u2019s the platform provided for Dele Alli, Harry Kane and Harry Winks and different players that were very successful in their moment. I hope that happens with him too because he\u2019s a great talent.\u201d We\u2019ll see. Because Thursday was the first day he was involved with the whole team and still he\u2019s not had one tactical session with us. We were six or seven players training in the last week and still I cannot tell if he\u2019s going to play in one or another position. We\u2019re going to assess him and see how he adapts to the new club and new level of football. From the Championship with Fulham to Tottenham in the Champions League is going to be completely different The good thing is that he has the capacity to play in different positions. That\u2019s an interesting quality and maybe he can play in different positions for us. It will be very helpful And on Troy Parrott, who the Irish are rightly getting excited about after three goals for their U21 team this week. I think he needs time, we need to be relaxed. We cannot put his name in the spotlight every day because we\u2019re not going to help him by doing that. He\u2019s still so young. The best way to help him is to be calm and relaxed about him. If he\u2019s going to be involved, perfect. If he\u2019s going to be involved with the Under-23s instead, perfect. Sometimes he\u2019ll train with us, good. Now it\u2019s a process where he needs to be relaxed. If we put too much pressure we\u2019re going to force or push him to make a mistake and that\u2019s what we don\u2019t want. The Premier League previews are coming in. Looking through Billy Gimour\u2019s eyes. Manager of the month for August is none other than J\u00fcrgen Klopp. More on that Sean Longstaff injury for Newcastle. It sounds nasty. Steve Bruce: \u201cIt\u2019s one of those awful ones. He goes to stop a cross and gets his ankle caught. It\u2019s one of those freak ones that unfortunately happen. You come off the pitch and we\u2019re all disappointed. We\u2019ve lost a player to a freak accident, but that\u2019s what happens in football. Sometimes, you miss out.\u201d Well done to Teemu Pukki, who has made a real splash in the Premier League. Vincent Kompany was back in Manchester for his testimonial and had kind words for former central defensive partner John Stones, who has a big task on his hands in the absence of Aymeric Laporte. Stones is expected to play at Norwich on Saturday evening after returning from a hamstring problem. I\u2019ve always said John is one of the most talented defenders. He\u2019s got such a bright future. He\u2019s already achieved a lot, let\u2019s not forget that. He\u2019s not a young defender anymore that hasn\u2019t got any experience. He\u2019s a multiple Premier League-winning central defender that is growing. The one thing I wish for him is consistency - consistency of games and consistency of fitness - and then he will show the world how good he is. By the end of it, if City can win a Champions League or something, all of a sudden he\u2019ll be mentioned in a completely different category. He just has to get himself on the pitch, be himself and he\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve not seen signs of weakness I need to be worried about. He\u2019s just a top-class defender. If now he gets to play games things will sort themselves out, no doubt. Watford have an old/new manager in charge this weekend in Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores. Nick Ames covered this in this week\u2019s Ten Things. They take on Arsenal on Sunday. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss? Well, up to a point. Watford being Watford, only six of the players Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores managed in his previous spell are still on the scene so it may take time before he is fully reacquainted with the place he describes as \u201cmy home\u201d. It was no surprise Watford\u2019s owners blinked at the first sign of trouble for Javi Gracia and it would take some bravery to predict Flores\u2019s return lasting longer than his previous 11-and-a-half-month tenure. He has a tough job and, given Manchester City await after Arsenal, things may deteriorate before he can steady the ship. Even if he is not familiar with most of his new charges yet, one of them knows Sunday\u2019s opponents especially well. Danny Welbeck was eased back by Gracia, having missed most of last season. But 90 minutes in last month\u2019s League Cup win over Coventry boded well and a fortnight\u2019s training over the international break cannot have hurt. Giving Welbeck his first start might be the early masterstroke Flores needs; if one ex has come back to help Watford, another could boost their cause by downing his former employers. Quiz! Quiz! Quiz! The admission by PGMOL chief Mike Riley that VAR has got four decisions wrong in the Premier League this season has led to a certain TV broadcaster loading their coverage with questions about the infernal machines. Per the BBC the decisions were: Appeals for a penalty from Manchester City for a foul on midfielder David Silva in their 3-1 win at Bournemouth on 25 August should have been given. A foul on West Ham striker Sebastien Haller in their win against Norwich on 31 August should have resulted in a penalty. Leicester City\u2019s Youri Tielemans should have been sent off for his foul on Bournemouth\u2019s Callum Wilson on the same day. Also on 31 August, a handball by Newcastle United\u2019s Isaac Hayden was missed in the build-up to Fabian Schar\u2019s equaliser against Watford. Eddie Howe, who speaks at 8am every week, was first on the blocks: \u201cIt\u2019s a positive thing that mistakes have been admitted, there will be things that need to be ironed out. I\u2019m still on the fence.\u201d Overnight Tottenham news. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r could be missing up to seven Manchester United players for Leicester City\u2019s visit to Old Trafford on Saturday. Anthony Martial, Paul Pogba, Diogo Dalot, Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly are unavailable, while Jesse Lingard and Aaron-Wan Bissaka are doubts. Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cThe treatment room\u2019s been busy and still is so we don\u2019t really know who\u2019s going to be available \u2013 there\u2019s maybe Aaron, maybe Jesse and I think maybe that\u2019s it but I can\u2019t promise those two will be available either. \u201cPogba won\u2019t be fit, no, unless he\u2019s had a miraculous recovery overnight from yesterday to today or tonight to tomorrow; he\u2019s not been ready to do 100% training, no. \u201cWe hope more can be ready for West Ham next week and Paul and Anthony are in that category, I think they\u2019ll be ready for then and can\u2019t say more than that really.\u201d Culture corner, a book review no less. Big news: Paul Pogba is OUT of Manchester United\u2019s game with Leicester with an ankle injury he limped from the Southampton pitch with two weeks ago. Also out: Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw. Probably out: Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Jesse Lingard. Oh dear. Good news from last night\u2019s Women\u2019s Champions League, he says in the style of Clive Tyldesley, when he used to talk of good tidings of Liverpool scoring during a Manchester United live match in the old ITV Champions League days. Anyway, two good results for WSL teams. Scratch that, brilliant results. Get your rumours here. Fast forward to the present. Bad news for Newcastle. Andy Carroll is still not fit for an emotional return to Anfield, either, while Allan Saint-Maximin is likely to miss out. Talking of 4-3, here\u2019s Rob Smyth from the vault, bravely choosing to question the greatest ever game in the greatest league in the world ever. Who still remembers Skins, by the way? And we\u2019re back. Away from the Euro 2020 qualifiers and that odd conundrum where Scotland can still qualify despite being absolutely gubbed, back to the calming, soothing waters of the Premier League. What have we learned during the prorogue? Raheem Sterling is still excellent, Harry Maguire can be turned easily and Tottenham continue to have misfortune with injury, with Giovani Lo Celso coming back from the United States with a knackered hip. This weekend, the prime fixture looks to be Liverpool 4-3 Newcastle on Saturday lunchtime. Manchester United v Leicester is a test of Leicester\u2019s claims for the top six and beyond, while Norwich\u2019s leaky defence has Manchester City to contend with on Saturday evening. Wilfried Zaha sacked his agent over failing to get to Tottenham, it has been reported, so Saturday offers chance for him to look longingly at what he could have won. And there were whispers that Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo might have been a contender for Chelsea so his Wolves team have a chance to show their manager\u2019s credentials. Has the international break allowed Frank Lampard to come up with a Plan B, or something that will last beyond half-time? All that and more through the day.",

Ten candidates, four moderators, three hours, two languages and hopefully one person who can beat Donald Trump.\u201d Trevor Noah On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah reacted to many of the same moments from Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate. \u201cBernie with a diminished voice is just not the same, man,\u201d said Noah on Sanders\u2019s uncleared throat. \u201cIt\u2019s like Luke Skywalker but with a butter knife.\u201d Most of the candidates seemed to be on the same page with gun reform. O\u2019Rourke, whose home town faced a deadly mass shooting just a month ago, came out particularly strong with a promise to require assault weapon buy-backs. The promise was \u201ca ballsy statement\u201d, said Noah. \u201cAnd he said it with such confidence as well \u2013 which is not the way I\u2019d talk about taking away assault rifles from people who like to shoot.\u201d On immigration, the candidates discussed how they plan to undo Trump\u2019s policies \u2013 a platform Noah described as \u201cno more kids in cages, increased legal immigration, give everyone free ladders to climb over the wall\u201d. Biden was asked point-blank if he thought Obama\u2019s immigration policies, under which 3 million people were deported, were a mistake. \u201cThe president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time,\u201d Biden replied. When the moderator countered \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Biden shifted responsibility with: \u201cI\u2019m the vice-president of the United States.\u201d \u201cThat was not a good look for Biden,\u201d Noah commented, \u201cbecause this always happens, right? When Obama\u2019s being praised, Biden jumps into the picture with him, but then when Obama\u2019s being criticized Biden\u2019s like, look man, I was the vice-president \u2013 I didn\u2019t do shit.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel The Democratic debate featured 10 candidates, \u201call of whom tried to stand out and avoid being eliminated under extreme time pressure in a televised event that was in no way at all like a gameshow,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel, because, as he noted: \u201cThis is democracy \u2013 it\u2019s very serious. Now let\u2019s put 45 seconds on the clock and go.\u201d For starters, \u201cBernie made a strong argument tonight for giving every American access to affordable throat lozenges,\u201d joked Kimmel, who likened Sanders\u2019s scratchy tirades against American healthcare spending to keeping \u201chis turn signal on for an hour and a half\u201d. Kimmel then turned to Yang, who promised to give his \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d of $1,000 a month for a year to 10 random families who signed up on his website. \u201cThat might be the most ridiculous proposal I\u2019ve ever seen on this network, and I\u2019ve watched every episode of The Bachelorette,\u201d Kimmel said. All in all, Kimmel concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t know who \u2018won\u2019 the debate, but watching candidates discuss the issues using real facts \u2013 I\u2019ve forgotten what it was like. It was like walking out of North Korea and into a Costco.\u201d",

Darren Floyd, another Spillers regular, said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it when we found out they were coming here.\u201d</p> <p>The appearance of Pixies at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/apr/18/small-business-spotlight-spillers-records\">Spillers</a> could be seen as rock music\u2019s recognition of a great Welsh institution, which is celebrating its 125th year.</p> <p>In 2010 there was an outcry when the smartening up of Cardiff city centre sent rents soaring and threatened the existence of Spillers and other independent retailers.</p> <p>Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen were among the global stars who signed a petition calling for it to be saved. The shop moved from the main drag into Morgan Arcade and continued to trade.</p> <p>Those waiting in the queue to meet Pixies said it was the personal touch that made Spillers special. Justin Shaer said he visited every Friday \u2013 record release day \u2013 and there was often a pile of records waiting for him. He said: \u201cThey know what I like. I don\u2019t have to ask for it.

But their decision to sign LPs and posters for 100 fans on the day their new record was released seemed charmingly uncommercial.</p> <p>Ashli Todd, the owner of Spillers, said: \u201cThey\u2019re lovely, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Meanwhile the band\u2019s frontman, Charles Thompson IV, AKA Black Francis, bobbed his head to the song On Graveyard Hill from the new album. His eyes were hidden by shades but he and the other band members seemed cheerful enough as they signed and chatted away.</p> <p>Todd said: \u201cIt\u2019s not every day we have living legends like this in our shop. I\u2019ve worked here for 23 years. This was the most nervous day for me. I\u2019m bowled over they chose an independent shop.\u201d</p> <p>The majority of pre-orders for the album in Spillers were for the vinyl edition. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely a vinyl kind of band,\u201d said Todd. A limited edition in white vinyl was going down particularly well. The resurgence of interest in vinyl is helping Spillers.</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/millennials-are-going-nuts-for-vinyl-revival/\">more than 4m chart-eligible LPs were sold in the UK alone compared with 3.2m records sold in 2016</a>. This is expected to rise to about 4.5m in 2019.</p> <p>Earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/vinyl-cds-revenue-growth-riaa-880959/\">Rolling Stone reported</a> that the revenue generated by record sales was likely to surpass that of CDs \u2013 though it also points out that streaming is by far the most popular way of listening to music.</p> <p>It\u2019s still a struggle for shops like Spillers. Todd said: \u201cThe economy has been going through a bumpy time. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the UK \u2013 you can\u2019t turn on the radio without hearing about more dramatic downturns on the high street, which makes events like this one so important.\u201d</p> <p>The signings done, the band ambled off.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThat was amazing, awesome. I couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d said Bianca Ferrari as she staggered out of Spillers Records in Cardiff after meeting a band she has loved all her life. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming to this record shop since I was seven and I adore it but that was just something else. Surreal \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m on another planet.\u201d The sight of the alt-rock legends Pixies insouciantly strolling along a Victorian arcade in the Welsh capital and perching behind the counter at Spillers, which claims to be the oldest record shop in the world, to meet fans was an other-worldly one. It was appropriate that the US band fastened on Friday the 13th for the launch of their seventh album, Beneath the Eyrie, with its tales of witchcraft, lost souls and graveyards. But the venue for the launch was surprising. Darren Floyd, another Spillers regular, said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it when we found out they were coming here.\u201d The appearance of Pixies at Spillers could be seen as rock music\u2019s recognition of a great Welsh institution, which is celebrating its 125th year. In 2010 there was an outcry when the smartening up of Cardiff city centre sent rents soaring and threatened the existence of Spillers and other independent retailers. Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen were among the global stars who signed a petition calling for it to be saved. The shop moved from the main drag into Morgan Arcade and continued to trade. Those waiting in the queue to meet Pixies said it was the personal touch that made Spillers special. Justin Shaer said he visited every Friday \u2013 record release day \u2013 and there was often a pile of records waiting for him. He said: \u201cThey know what I like. I don\u2019t have to ask for it. The records are there waiting for me.\u201d Pixies were opening their worldwide tour in Cardiff on Friday night so they had not travelled far out of their way. But their decision to sign LPs and posters for 100 fans on the day their new record was released seemed charmingly uncommercial. Ashli Todd, the owner of Spillers, said: \u201cThey\u2019re lovely, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Meanwhile the band\u2019s frontman, Charles Thompson IV, AKA Black Francis, bobbed his head to the song On Graveyard Hill from the new album. His eyes were hidden by shades but he and the other band members seemed cheerful enough as they signed and chatted away. Todd said: \u201cIt\u2019s not every day we have living legends like this in our shop. I\u2019ve worked here for 23 years. This was the most nervous day for me. I\u2019m bowled over they chose an independent shop.\u201d The majority of pre-orders for the album in Spillers were for the vinyl edition. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely a vinyl kind of band,\u201d said Todd. A limited edition in white vinyl was going down particularly well. The resurgence of interest in vinyl is helping Spillers. Last year, more than 4m chart-eligible LPs were sold in the UK alone compared with 3.2m records sold in 2016. This is expected to rise to about 4.5m in 2019. Earlier this month Rolling Stone reported that the revenue generated by record sales was likely to surpass that of CDs \u2013 though it also points out that streaming is by far the most popular way of listening to music. It\u2019s still a struggle for shops like Spillers. Todd said: \u201cThe economy has been going through a bumpy time. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the UK \u2013 you can\u2019t turn on the radio without hearing about more dramatic downturns on the high street, which makes events like this one so important.\u201d The signings done, the band ambled off. Pixies lead guitarist, Joey Santiago, a record shop enthusiast, paused to admire the scale (modest) of the store. \u201cIt\u2019s nice and personal,\u201d he said. I\u2019ve got a soft spot for this sort of mom-and-pop store. It\u2019s real.\u201d Racks of history Spillers Records is a Welsh rock and pop music institution. Before they made it big, Manic Street Preachers used to travel down from the valleys to busk in front of the shop. The like of Cerys Matthews, of Catatonia and BBC 6 Music, and the Welsh indie darlings Super Furry Animals used to browse the racks in search of inspiration. In 2010 when Spillers\u2019 future was threatened by soaring rents, more than 20,000 people \u2013 including Justin Timberlake and Beyonce \u2013 signed a petition to save it. Thankfully for record fans everywhere the shop carried on \u2013 albeit in a new location \u2013 and partly thanks to the revived interest in vinyl collecting. Spillers has a rich tradition dating back to 1894 when Henry Spiller opened in the Queen\u2019s Arcade specialising in the sale of phonographs, wax phonograph cylinders and shellac phonograph discs. In the early 1920s, Henry\u2019s son, Edward, took over and, with the aid of accordionist and band leader Joe Gregory, sold musical instruments alongside prerecorded music. In the late 1940s Henry moved the shop round the corner to a larger premises on the Hayes, where it remained until those rising rents put its very existence in doubt. It closed for a month and reopened with a gig headlined by Gruff Rhys, of the Super Furry Animals (the band\u2019s Welsh-language album Mwng remains a perennial top seller). Knowledge and the personal touch are the keys to the shop\u2019s survival in the face of fierce competition from downloads and streaming. Long-time owner Nick Todd knew many of his customers so well that when a regular arrived he would pop on a new tune he knew he or she would love and almost certainly guarantee a sale. Spillers is now owned by Todd\u2019s daughter Ashli Todd, who worked there from the mid-90s having been offered the choice by her dad of mucking out the chickens at home or helping out in Spillers. When Ashli Todd took over she put her faith in vinyl, which turned out to be a masterstroke. In these troubled times when the high street is struggling Spillers has become a rare success story.",

We must mine each aspect of his character for clues as to what\u2019s next. Sure, Cummings has a <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/\">blog</a> (now dormant) \u2013 and I\u2019m not going to say it doesn\u2019t have some clever ideas \u2013 but it also reads as though he went to a <em>lot </em>of evening classes at Alain de Botton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theschooloflife.com/\">The School of Life</a>.</p> <p>In the 19th century, a gilet was more frequently an embroidered waistcoat and closer to a jerkin (a close-fitting open vest popular in the 16th century). Nowadays, it is a versatile garment: a sporty, padded body-warmer made popular by snowboarders; a reversible combination of suede and shearling for late-morning coffees or school runs; or the rabbit fur that Sienna Miller teamed with Ugg boots and every single festival between 2002 and 2004, AKA the era of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boho-chic#Sienna_Miller_in_the_early_2000s\">boho</a>.</p> <p>In the era of Bojo, Cummings\u2019 favourite item is quilted and navy blue with a burgundy trim. I did think it might be <a href=\"https://www.barbour.com/uk/mens/gilets-and-waistcoats\">Barbour</a>, which would be fitting for a man whose father-in-law <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/pm-aide-dominic-cummings-blames-19928675\">lives in a castle</a>. But, on closer inspection, I spotted a hare logo and discovered it is made by Joules. <a href=\"https://www.joules.com/Men/Gilets/Marine-Navy/Halesworth/Fleece-Lined-Quilted-Gilet?id=Z_HALESWRTH%7CMARNAVY\">A similar item</a> \u2013 in marine navy \u2013 goes for an extremely reasonable \u00a369.95 (in clearance). Joules is a British company (thank God!) inspired by \u201ccountry lifestyles\u201d. As fashion journalist and Vogue columnist Raven Smith observes: \u201cHe dresses like a student popping to the 24-hour garage for cereal during a Fortnite binge. With all the sweatshirts-com-epaulettes, he\u2019s over-layering so it\u2019s a filo pastry of threadbare athleisure.

This isn\u2019t based on the fact he is bald. Many people are bald. It is because of the lightbulb shape of his skull, his pointy ears and popping eyes, and the fact that his ambition is the same as Brain\u2019s: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJYmyYzuTa8\">taking over the world</a>.</p> <p>Very occasionally, Brain wears a suit when plotting.

It has stayed open-necked since, but these days Cummings wears his shirts with more <a href=\"https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/heavage.1671542/\">heavage</a> (male cleavage) on show. His signature twist is to rock a collar with one side tucked and the other not, embracing the asymmetrical trend exemplified by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2019/sep/11/asymmetric-jeans-will-you-wear-the-trousers-that-are-flared-one-side-skinny-the-other\">much talked about</a> Ksenia Schnaider jeans. At least Cummings\u2019 shirts are mostly white, which, I used to think, was a classic staple difficult to get wrong. Except it is unclear whether Cummings owns an iron (perhaps too much a signifier of rich remainers). Mostly, he wears his shirts spilling over his jeans, apart from when he once tucked it in with a brown belt, which did not do its job, revealing the evil genius\u2019s black boxers in a look more commonly seen in a drill video than on the steps of No 10.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23724b06008c250daef0c349afe968ecc53e804b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23724b06008c250daef0c349afe968ecc53e804b/0_55_2499_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings\u2019 unequal collar look.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings\u2019 unequal collar look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When going casual, Cummings favours shapeless T-shirts in block colours with obscure logos. You might think nothing much can be gleaned from Cummings\u2019 old tees, except one of these logos looks a little like a wigwam emitting a signal. Further research reveals that it is the logo of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Foo_Camp\">Sci Foo</a> camp, described as an \u201cunconference\u201d for emerging technology and scientific ideas. <em>Unconference</em>. Classic Dom. (The camps are held annually at the Googleplex in California.)

Cummings loves a tote. He carries around a Vote Leave-branded one in the manner of someone who went to <a href=\"https://www.dauntbooks.co.uk/bags/\">Daunt</a>, once. It\u2019s from 2016, of course, this canvas of lies, which means it could probably be sold as vintage for \u00a330 in a Hackney pop-up. He has also been spotted with a tote-with-a-quote: \u201cIt was nine-thirty on Christmas Eve \u2026\u201d The opening line of Susan Hill\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woman_in_Black\">Woman in Black</a>; a 1983 Gothic-inspired horror novel.

This is a 90s skateboarder staple or an ex-boyfriend\u2019s garment that is frequently worn by women around the house or for casual Sunday roasts, drawstrings pulled tight. Of course, Cummings made it weird by shoulder-robing it.</p> <p>Is this new wardrobe addition a sign that the often implosive, sweary Cummings (spotted recently stalking the halls of the palace <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/1168973984836268034?lang=en\">with a red wine</a>) will take a more casual approach to his career? Almost certainly not, as the country struggles through an apparently endless constitutional crisis or heads to a general election. We await with baited breath the clues to come from further tote and tee logos.</p>",

We must mine each aspect of his character for clues as to what\u2019s next. Sure, Cummings has a blog (now dormant) \u2013 and I\u2019m not going to say it doesn\u2019t have some clever ideas \u2013 but it also reads as though he went to a lot of evening classes at Alain de Botton\u2019s The School of Life. In the 19th century, a gilet was more frequently an embroidered waistcoat and closer to a jerkin (a close-fitting open vest popular in the 16th century). Nowadays, it is a versatile garment: a sporty, padded body-warmer made popular by snowboarders; a reversible combination of suede and shearling for late-morning coffees or school runs; or the rabbit fur that Sienna Miller teamed with Ugg boots and every single festival between 2002 and 2004, AKA the era of boho. In the era of Bojo, Cummings\u2019 favourite item is quilted and navy blue with a burgundy trim. I did think it might be Barbour, which would be fitting for a man whose father-in-law lives in a castle. But, on closer inspection, I spotted a hare logo and discovered it is made by Joules. A similar item \u2013 in marine navy \u2013 goes for an extremely reasonable \u00a369.95 (in clearance). Joules is a British company (thank God!) inspired by \u201ccountry lifestyles\u201d. As fashion journalist and Vogue columnist Raven Smith observes: \u201cHe dresses like a student popping to the 24-hour garage for cereal during a Fortnite binge. With all the sweatshirts-com-epaulettes, he\u2019s over-layering so it\u2019s a filo pastry of threadbare athleisure. A proper coat would do.\u201d Cummings reminds me of Brain from Steven Spielberg\u2019s Pinky and the Brain. This isn\u2019t based on the fact he is bald. Many people are bald. It is because of the lightbulb shape of his skull, his pointy ears and popping eyes, and the fact that his ambition is the same as Brain\u2019s: taking over the world. Very occasionally, Brain wears a suit when plotting. In 2001, when he was campaign director at Business for Sterling, Cummings wore a suit. Floppy but thinning hair, hands jauntily in his pockets \u2013 and in another shot, a cigarette languidly between his fingers \u2013 the vibe is very \u201cauthor photograph on the inside jacket of a self-published novel\u201d. The shirt is open-necked. It has stayed open-necked since, but these days Cummings wears his shirts with more heavage (male cleavage) on show. His signature twist is to rock a collar with one side tucked and the other not, embracing the asymmetrical trend exemplified by the much talked about Ksenia Schnaider jeans. At least Cummings\u2019 shirts are mostly white, which, I used to think, was a classic staple difficult to get wrong. Except it is unclear whether Cummings owns an iron (perhaps too much a signifier of rich remainers). Mostly, he wears his shirts spilling over his jeans, apart from when he once tucked it in with a brown belt, which did not do its job, revealing the evil genius\u2019s black boxers in a look more commonly seen in a drill video than on the steps of No 10. When going casual, Cummings favours shapeless T-shirts in block colours with obscure logos. You might think nothing much can be gleaned from Cummings\u2019 old tees, except one of these logos looks a little like a wigwam emitting a signal. Further research reveals that it is the logo of Sci Foo camp, described as an \u201cunconference\u201d for emerging technology and scientific ideas. Unconference. Classic Dom. (The camps are held annually at the Googleplex in California.) Take his shoes off and this could be a Steve Hilton look. Also: tote bags. Cummings loves a tote. He carries around a Vote Leave-branded one in the manner of someone who went to Daunt, once. It\u2019s from 2016, of course, this canvas of lies, which means it could probably be sold as vintage for \u00a330 in a Hackney pop-up. He has also been spotted with a tote-with-a-quote: \u201cIt was nine-thirty on Christmas Eve \u2026\u201d The opening line of Susan Hill\u2019s Woman in Black; a 1983 Gothic-inspired horror novel. Gothic-inspired horror doesn\u2019t seem too far away from where we currently are. Other accessories include a pen behind the ear; black square-framed glasses (think Colin Firth in Tom Ford\u2019s A Single Man); and an ever-present lanyard, presumably holding the parliamentary pass he should never have been granted. Perhaps the gilet jokes have become a little too much for Cummings, however, who this week was spotted in a departure piece: a grey Levi\u2019s hoodie. This is a 90s skateboarder staple or an ex-boyfriend\u2019s garment that is frequently worn by women around the house or for casual Sunday roasts, drawstrings pulled tight. Of course, Cummings made it weird by shoulder-robing it. Is this new wardrobe addition a sign that the often implosive, sweary Cummings (spotted recently stalking the halls of the palace with a red wine) will take a more casual approach to his career? Almost certainly not, as the country struggles through an apparently endless constitutional crisis or heads to a general election. We await with baited breath the clues to come from further tote and tee logos.",

Healthcare professionals value spending time building relationships with parents and their new babies, but intense pressures on the NHS make this incredibly difficult. A funded postnatal medical appointment at six to eight weeks specifically to assess new mothers\u2019 physical and mental health would be a major opportunity to improve postnatal support for mothers. We urge the relevant health authorities to implement this important proposal.

      "bodyText": "It was with interest that I read of the financial hardship faced by many clergy (Clergy struggling to pay bills turn to charities and payday lenders, 7 September). As a member of a rural North Yorkshire congregation, I am well aware of falling numbers and unrealistic workloads which are not alleviated by suitable financial remuneration. This is not new. In his book Yorkshire Oddities, the Rev Sabine Baring Gould (composer of Onward Christian Soldiers) wrote about the case of Rev Mr Carter, curate of Lastingham, North Yorkshire. With a family of 13 children and a stipend of \u00a320 a year, he struggled to make ends meet. He supplemented his income by selling fish, which he was skilled at catching, to the local gentry. The main thrust of the story, however, is that Carter\u2019s wife ran a pub that parishioners were encouraged to attend to sustain them on their long journeys home after the service, and in which he would entertain them on his violin. The story centres on the visit of the archdeacon, who was alarmed at reports of events in Lastingham and Carter\u2019s defence of his actions. In the end the archdeacon acknowledged the propriety of the arguments and complimented the curate. Perhaps Baring Gould has shown a way to solve two of the crises facing our rural communities \u2013 the pitifully low pay of many of our clergy and the remorseless march of the closure of rural pubs.

HKEX isn\u2019t walking away, though. It plans to continue talking to LSE investors, and argues that its offer makes sense.

It\u2019s agreed to buy SSE\u2019s household supply arm in a \u00a3500m deal. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has suffered a 4.5% drop in profits due to rising costs, despite a healthy 7.4% jump in sales. Chairman Tim Martin has hit out at \u201cOxbridge\u201d MPs for thwarting Brexit, and told us the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer analysis was \u201cbollocks\u201d.... Newsflash: The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing has responded to the LSE\u2019s rebuttal - and is refusing to go away quietly. HKEX says it is disappointed that its London rival won\u2019t \u201cproperly engage\u201d. It also defends its proposal, saying it is in the \u201cbest interests of shareholders, customers and global markets\u201d. They say: The Board of HKEX continues to believe that the proposed combination with LSEG represents a highly compelling strategic opportunity to create a global market infrastructure leader. Intriguingly, HKEX says it has held \u201cconstructive\u201d initial discussions with regulators and policymakers (it doesn\u2019t say where, but presumably they include London?). And despite the LSE\u2019s refusal to engage further, HKEX says it plans to continue engaging with shareholders.... This is interesting..... Looks like Donald Trump\u2019s message has got through to Americans - we\u2019ll find out at next week\u2019s Fed meeting whether Jay Powell is among them... Despite recession fears, and the US China trade war, American consumer confidence has gone up! The Michigan Consumer Sentiment index, just released, has risen to 92.0 for September, beating August\u2019s 89.8. That\u2019s also better than the 90.9 which Wall Street expected. Still down on July\u2019s punchy 98.4, but it may calm worries that the US economy is weakening. Of course, if consumers are less gloomy, there\u2019s less need to cut interest rates as Donald Trump is demanding on an almost daily basis. Here\u2019s some reaction: The US stock market has made a muted start to the final trading day of the week. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 62 points, or 0.23%, in early trading at 27,245. Mining stocks, financial companies and industrial firms are among the risers. That reflects optimism that the US-China trade war is thawing, now that Beijing has dropped new tariffs on American soybeans and pork imports. Here\u2019s our news story on the LSE-HKEX (non) merger: Zimbabwe\u2019s eye-watering interest rate hike, from 50% to 70%, is presumably an attempt to calm its inflation rate, which is acceleratingly alarmingly. According to official data, Zimbabwe\u2019s inflation rate almost doubled in July, to 175% year-on-year. Unofficial estimates suggest it is much higher, as shortages of food and fuel leave citizens facing sharply higher prices every day. Now this is a rate hike: Here\u2019s Roger Barron, M&amp;A Partner at law firm Paul Hastings, on the London Stock Exchange\u2019s move: \u201cIt\u2019s unsurprising that they have rejected this approach as the fact it was unsolicited means that the bidder must have known it wouldn\u2019t have been popular \u2013 if it had they would have tried to agree a recommended bid and maintain confidentiality. It\u2019s perhaps also surprising that they didn\u2019t make this announcement sooner.\u201d The LSE\u2019s firm rejection of HKEX\u2019s takeover approach isn\u2019t a surprise, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. He writes: Unattractive, offering a puny dowry and coming with volatile and unpredictable parents, HKEX never looked like the ideal bride. No great surprise to see the LSEG board has politely but firmly rejected the HKEX bid. The letter to HKEX is not full of praise. In fact the letter from chairman Don Robert scolds HKEX for making public the highly speculative bid only days after telling LSEG. So now that the LSE has dismissed HKEX\u2019s charms, will someone else try their luck? Wilson suggests a US suitor could be hovering in the wings: The question now is whether the Americans come in with a counter offer. Shares are holding around the \u00a373 level, suggesting there could be some interest. A knockout premium would be the price, but as we saw with Sky/Comcast, it\u2019s not that far-fetched if the prize is deemed of enough strategic importance. The LSE has also sent a blisteringly critical letter to the HKEX, explaining why its approach has been soundly rejected. And they\u2019ve released it to the City. The LSE\u2019s chair, Don Robert, begins by chastising HKEX\u2019s chair, Laura Cha, and CEO Li Xiaojia, for going public with their proposed merger, saying: We were very surprised and disappointed that you decided to publish your unsolicited proposal within two days of our receiving it. Robert then argues that: 1) There is no strategic merit for the LSE group in combining with the HKEX. The high geographic concentration and heavy exposure to market transaction volumes in your business would represent a significant backward step for LSEG strategically. For that reason, the LSE thinks it\u2019s ongoing deal to buy Refinitiv makes more sense. 2) The deal could fall foul of regulators, and certainly wouldn\u2019t be approved quickly. He says: Your proposal would be subject to full scrutiny from a number of financial regulators, as well as governmental entities under, for example, the UK Enterprise Act, the CFIUS process in the US, and the \u2018golden powers\u2019 regime in Italy. There is no doubt that your unusual Board structure and your relationship with the Hong Kong government will complicate matters. 3) The offer, a mix of cash and HKEX shares, is risky - due to the protests in Hong Kong. We see the value of your share consideration as inherently uncertain. The ongoing situation in Hong Kong adds to this uncertainty. 4) The offer, worth \u00a331.6bn, \u201cvalue falls substantially short of an appropriate valuation\u201d of LSEG (currently worth \u00a325bn). This all means a big thumbs-down from the LSE: Taking all of these factors into account, the Board unanimously rejects your proposal. Given the fundamental flaws in your proposal, we see no merit in further engagement. Newsflash: The London Stock Exchange has just roundly rejected the takeover proposal from its Hong Kong rival. In a terse statement to the stock market, the LSE says it has considered the \u00a332bn proposal made on Wednesday, and concluded it is fundamentally flawed. Not only that, the LSE sees \u201cno merit\u201d in holding talks with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing! It says: Further to the announcement on 11 September 2019, the Board of London Stock Exchange Group plc (\u201cLSEG\u201d), together with its financial and legal advisers, has now considered the unsolicited, preliminary and highly conditional proposal from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (\u201cHKEX\u201d) to acquire the entire share capital of LSEG (the \u201cConditional Proposal\u201d). The Board has fundamental concerns about the key aspects of the Conditional Proposal: strategy, deliverability, form of consideration and value. Accordingly, the Board unanimously rejects the Conditional Proposal and, given its fundamental flaws, sees no merit in further engagement. LSE adds that it remains committed to its takeover of financial data service Refinitiv -- a deal which is meant to turn the exchange into a challenger to Bloomberg. HKEX had said that its offer was conditional on the Refinitiv deal being abandoned. More to follow... Nick Marro, Global Trade Lead at The Economist Intelligence Unit, says China\u2019s decision is a clear sign of goodwill. He believes that dropping the new tariffs on pork and soybeans could help deliver progress at the US-China talks next month. But a full trade deal still looks a long way away. Here\u2019s Marro\u2019s take: Re-opening the Chinese market for US farmers is a big priority for the US trade team, and so China eliminating the tariffs on US soy and pork products is a pretty genuine sign of goodwill. It\u2019ll also be helpful in building more positive momentum before the trade talks planned in October. Allowing for more imports could also help China deal with its rising food price woes, particularly as the African swine fever outbreak worsens. That said we still expect pork imports to only modestly offset the inflationary impact of that disease, as most pork consumption in China is driven by domestic supply. We\u2019re still not optimistic about the prospects of a trade deal, with even an interim agreement only papering over the deeper structural issues at the heart of the relationship. Regardless of what happens with these tariffs, we still expect other issues--such as in technology and finance--to weigh on US-China relations in the longer term. Some important news is coming out of China on the trade war. Beijing has decided to add more US agricultural products to the list of goods that are exempted from its latest tariffs. And crucially, pork and soybeans -- two key exports - are on the list. That\u2019s according to the Xinhua news wire, citing official sources. It says: \u201cChina supports relevant enterprises buying certain amounts of soybeans, pork and other agricultural products from today in accordance with market principles and WTO rules.\u201d This means the tariff on both goods will drop back to 25% (imposed last year). Beijing had just hiked the levy on both goods at the start of September, to 30% for soybeans and a sizzling 35% for pork. This is the latest in a string of small concessions from both sides, which suggests that relations may be thawing ahead of new negotiations next month. China had already exempted 16 US products from its latest tariff hike, prompting Donald Trump to delay America\u2019s latest tariffs for a fortnight. Overnight, Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin said Washington hopes to make \u201cmeaningful progress\u201d when it sits down with officials from Beijing in October. He told CNBC he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about chances for a deal, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t want a trip that\u2019s just a series of discussions. We want to make meaningful progress. Wow. The pound has now gained nearly one and a half cents against the US dollar this morning, to a seven-week high of $1.2465. This means it\u2019s gained five whole cents since hitting a three-year low at the start of September. Michael Brown, senior analyst at Caxton FX, suggests caution: Sterling has rallied to its highest levels against the euro and dollar since late-July this morning, having gained more than 1% in reaction to the news that the DUP may be softening their stance on the Irish backstop. However, the pound remains vulnerable, with politics set to continue dominating and the Brexit landscape shifting as quickly as ever. The strength of the pound is pulling the FTSE 100 down this morning. It\u2019s lost 22 points or 0.3%, because a stronger sterling hurts multinationals\u2019 overseas earnings. But otherwise, now could be a good time to buy UK shares, according to analysts at Credit Suisse. They\u2019ve turned bullish on UK stocks this morning, arguing that valuations look relatively cheap now that a no-deal Brexit looks more likely. They told clients: \u201cGiven the most recent developments (...), we believe that investors should now be overweight of the UK, but more importantly in US dollar terms and still selectively. \u201cWe would buy UK international earners in dollar terms that are cheap versus their peer group.\u201d Credit Suisse predict the FTSE 100 could have risen to 7,600 by the middle of next year - up from 7,329 today. They suggest specialty chemical firm Johnson Matthey, pest controller Rentokil and cigarettes maker British American Tobacco as attractive stocks. The pound has hit its highest level since late July this morning, on growing optimism that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. Sterling has jumped by three-quarters of a cent to $1.2406, a seven-week high. The rally comes as investors grow more confident that a Halloween Brexit horror can be avoided. The Times has caused a stir this morning, reporting that Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP is softening its position - and could accept Northern Ireland accepting some EU rules after Brexit. That might allow a reshaping of the current Backstop agreement. However, DUP leaders Arlene Foster has rubbished the idea.... But there have been rumours for several days that Boris Johnson could be considering a Northern Ireland-only backstop to replace the current UK-wide one [this is the insurance policy in case a UK-EU free trade deal isn\u2019t reached]. Another development: cabinet ministers have been urging Johnson to ask Brussels for an extension, rather than disobey the parliamentary vote instructing him to seek more time if a deal can\u2019t be reached (the Telegraph reports here). Our Politics Live blog has all the action: European bank stocks are rising this morning, lifted by the ECB\u2019s new stimulus package. Financial companies are the top risers on the Stoxx 600, up 0.8% on average. This backs up the argument that the new two-tiered system for negative rates, and the more generous TLTRO loans programme, will help the banks. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has doubts about the ECB\u2019s firepower. The ECB has committed to keeping rates at current levels or lower until it sustainably achieves its inflation target. But the effectiveness of forward guidance rests on central bank credibility. The ECB\u2019s inability to achieve its inflation target a decade after the global financial crisis may undermine its credibility.\u201d Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale writes that Mario Draghi is going out swinging, but perhaps not connecting as he used to: Mario Draghi reminds me of an ageing boxer, still up for the fight but unable to pack the same punch as he used to. The currency fell yesterday on the news of a rate cut and an open-ended bond-buying programme, but it\u2019s clear that it isn\u2019t open ended unless the ECB can widen the pool of bonds they buy. It\u2019s not at all clear that the impact on the economy will be significant and it\u2019s crystal clear that the baton needs to be handed to fiscal policy sharpish. German newspapers are horrified that the European Central Bank is launching a new stimulus programme. Bild, the tabloid, has dubbed Draghi a \u2018dracula\u2019 who has sucked billions of euros from thrifty German savers (they claim). They warn: The horror for German savers continues: ECB chief Mario Draghi (72) wants to tighten the zero interest rate policy even more! It\u2019s not surprising to see such concerns. Saving rates are at record low levels, which is clearly unpopular in Germany where the savings rate is double that of the UK. But analyst Fred Ducrozet argues that today\u2019s criticism is misplaced. He says the ECB actually helped German banks yesterday (by changing how its negative interest rates will be applied to bank reserves). Boom! The newest member of the ECB\u2019s governing council has gone public with his concerns over Draghi\u2019s stimulus package. Governor Robert Holzmann, the new chief of Austria\u2019s National Bank, has confirmed that some eurozone central bank governors pushed back against the moves agreed yesterday. He believes the plan could be a mistake. According to Holzmann it was a \u201cvery intensive but also very constructive council meeting\u201d in Frankfurt yesterday. Some policymakers clearly felt that monetary policy had done about as much as it could. Holzmann told Bloomberg: Essentially it was the question about how effective will a new monetary easing be. And in a clear challenge to the departing Draghi, Holzmann suggests that his successor, Christine Lagarde, could amend the stimulus. \u201cAs things change -- also this forward guidance and the policy may change -- not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow, but I wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s there for the next decades. One problem with that theory: Lagarde, like Draghi, is certainly on the dovish wing of global policymakers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Shares are advancing higher this morning after the European Central Bank delivered a wide-ranging, and controversial, stimulus package yesterday. In his last major act as ECB president, Mario Draghi restarted the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme, with a new plan to buy \u20ac20bn of bonds each month. He also cut its deposit rate (paid on commercial bank deposits at the ECB) deeper into negative territory, and introduced a new two-tiered system to protect bank profits. The ECB also sweetened its cheap loans programme, to encourage banks to lend to the real economy, and made a new, tougher, pledge to leave borrowing costs at record lows until inflation has risen. The move pushed equities and bond prices higher, as investors welcomed these fresh measures to ward off a recession. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has jumped 1% overnight, and European markets are expected to nudge new six-week highs too. But the move was also controversial -- with Draghi facing a revolt from several members of his own governing council. France\u2019s Francois Villeroy de Galhau, the Netherlands Klaas Knot and Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann of Germany all pushed back against parts of the programme - in vain. As Bloomberg explains: Those three governors alone represent roughly half of the euro region as measured by economic output and population. Other dissenters included, but weren\u2019t limited, to their colleagues from Austria and Estonia, as well as members on the ECB\u2019s Executive Board including Sabine Lautenschlaeger and the markets chief, Benoit Coeure, the officials said. This backlash suggests that some central bankers believe monetary policy is reaching the end of the line. Draghi himself warned that governments need to raise their spending to lift economic growth, rather than relying on monetary policy to do all the heavy lifting. With the eurozone economy looking weak, and Germany possibly in recession, he declared: It is high time for fiscal policy to take charge. European finance chiefs are meeting in Helsinki today - we\u2019ll see if they respond to his call.

Speaking in Doncaster market, the woman told Johnson: \u201cPeople have died because of austerity. And then you\u2019ve got the cheek to come here and tell us austerity is over and it\u2019s all good now, we\u2019re going to leave the EU and everything is going to be great. It\u2019s just a fairytale.\u201d",

Today, his energy upstart is valued at a billion pounds and will soon be one of the largest energy suppliers in Britain \u2013 second only to British Gas.</p>\n    <p>The Northern Irishman\u2019s stellar ascent is put down to a canny mix of business acumen, good political timing and carefully choreographed showmanship. His company\u2019s appeal is simpler: energy which is cheap, green and easy to buy.</p>\n    <p>Fitzpatrick, a former City trader, founded Ovo a decade ago with \u00a3350,000 with the belief that \u201ctrying to do things differently could make a real impact\u201d. He turned to the energy industry with an antidote to the major suppliers, as mistrust in its biggest players deepened and bills were on the rise.</p>\n    <p>But it was his star-turn before numerous MP select committee inquiries into the troubled energy market around five years ago which secured his lead-role as a new breed of energy boss. His commitment to simplicity, transparency, and fairness, combined with outspoken attacks on rival energy bosses \u2013 often sitting beside him before MPs \u2013 quickly garnered headlines and a growing customer base.</p>\n    <p>The energy industry\u2019s new posterboy is not without controversy of his own. The former JP Morgan broker\u2019s multimillion-pound spending on property and a Formula One team raised eyebrows after his attacks on energy fat cats.</p>\n    <p>Ovo itself was accused of a cash grab. Its rivals criticised the company\u2019s decision to charge customers for energy before they have used it, warning it put customers\u2019 cash at risk.</p>\n    <p>In Ovo\u2019s early days Fitzpatrick claimed a salary of \u00a3120,000 a year but withdrew over \u00a32m from the company to buy a family home in the country in 2013, when it had barely begun making a profit.</p>\n    <p>Fitzpatrick, 41, went on to pump a reported \u00a330m into Anglo-Russia F1 racing team Marussia through Imagination Industries, his private holding company. The team lost its place in the Constructors\u2019 Championship in 2016, putting the brakes on Fitzpatrick\u2019s F1 dreams.-</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian understands that Ovo has also secured a debt deal with Barclays Capital, the company\u2019s financial adviser, to help finance the deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/11/ovo-energy-in-talks-to-buy-sses-household-supply-business\">which was double the price</a> expected by City analysts.</p> \n<p>After several months of talks between the two parties, Ovo agreed to fund the deal through a \u00a3100m loan agreement with SSE, and a further \u00a3400m which is covered by a mix of cash and new debt arrangements.</p> \n<p>The deal is expected to be completed later this year or early in 2020.</p> \n<p>SSE will then be free to turn its back on the falling profits in its energy supply business and focus on building and running renewable energy projects and energy networks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/energyshare-zip/giv-3902lTX1L9JaPeGh\" data-alt=\"customer numbers\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/energyshare-zip/giv-3902lTX1L9JaPeGh\">customer numbers</a> \n</figure> \n<p><br>SSE\u2019s home energy business made just \u00a335.3m of operating profit by in the last financial year, down from \u00a3221.8m the year before.

      "bodyText": "It all began with a promise Susan, 61, made to her mum in the early 90s. As they sat watching a documentary about the community of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, she vowed to one day track down her mum\u2019s uncle, who had emigrated to the South American country decades before. But it was only when Susan signed up to Ancestry that she was able to get properly stuck into unravelling her mum\u2019s family history. Susan holds a photo of her three-times great-grandmother Marjorie May Douglas Susan says: \u201cNeither of my parents talked about their family, and mum\u2019s family died relatively young \u2013 she was the last of her family. \u201cI knew her father was a Geordie, and I knew she had an uncle who had emigrated to South America, and one who was in Montreal, but I always felt there were some more things hanging around. \u201cI always believed that my mother\u2019s family held a treasure trove of information. \u201cAfter I took early retirement and had time to really look into our family history, it turned out I was right.\u201d The first of three major breakthroughs came when she connected with her mum\u2019s cousin Maria, who was born in Colombia but now lives in Arizona. They connected through a photograph of Maria\u2019s grandmother. Susan was ecstatic, and couldn\u2019t wait to tell her mum that she had tracked down her long-lost family. Susan\u2019s mum sadly passed away last year, which meant she never heard about two more exciting discoveries. Susan found out her grandfather also had an interesting lineage, after she was contacted by a cousin five times removed, Sheila, who had used Ancestry\u2019s DNA kit to expand on her own research. She told Susan that she is the three-times great granddaughter of Thomas Clough, the father of a dynasty of Northumbrian pipers whose influence continues to today. \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t contacted me, I would have known nothing about mum\u2019s Geordie family,\u201d says Susan, who adds that her sister, Alyson, has been particularly enamoured with this area of their history. There are YouTube videos and books about the Clough family\u2019s importance in English piping, and Susan admits that she thought there must have been a mistake when she saw just how revered the musical clan were. She says: \u201cThey were all miners but also renowned pipers. The last one of them died in the 1980s. There is a photo of him on Ancestry \u2013 he looks an old man. \u201cHe died when he was only 57, but he looks 80. It shows you exactly what life was like for the miners. Dreadful.\u201d However, not all of Susan\u2019s relatives met a sad end. Her three-times great-grandmother Marjorie May Douglas has proved to be one of the most inspirational people in her life \u2026 despite dying in 1874. Marjorie was born in 1790 in a remote corner of Perthshire, and after marrying went on to have a total of seven children, and live in London as well as her home village. But this wasn\u2019t all \u2013 at the age of 70, she upped sticks to Illinois, in the US, where she lived until her death in 1874, at the ripe old age of 84. Susan says: \u201cI cannot think of what she\u2019s done. Even going down to London in those days would have been uncomfortable, and then the sailing ship and perhaps a stagecoach travelling thousands of miles to Illinois at the other end. Susan\u2019s ancestor Thomas Clough (right), father of a dynasty of Northumbrian pipers \u201cI printed a photo of her from Ancestry, and she looked very severe, like they always did in those days. \u201cThen I looked again and I realised this was a woman who loved to laugh and loved to giggle, and if she was alive today we would have been laughing non-stop. I really connected with her. \u201cEven when I look at it now, I can see a smile forming on her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how I have bonded with someone I\u2019ve never met.\u201d Susan has been so moved by Marjorie\u2019s story that she hopes to use her passion for history and enthusiasm for research to work on a book telling the story of her life. She says: \u201cYou are connected to these people, and it\u2019s the weirdest of things to think that your DNA is travelling through the family. \u201cBut I look at Marjorie May Douglas and I know we would have been the best of friends.\u201d Discover your backstory by charting your family tree.

He is survived by four sons, Rehman, Imran, Sulaman and Usman, who each also played first-class cricket, and two daughters, Noor Fatima and Noor Aamina. \u2022 Abdul Qadir Khan, cricketer, born 15 September 1955; died 6 September 2019",

Theatre maestro Mendes never had quite the directorial career expected of him after American Beauty, as every one of his subsequent dramatic films (from Road to Perdition to the indie misfire Away We Go) registered as something of a handsome, impersonal disappointment, until he found his groove as part of the James Bond machine in Skyfall. Ball, meanwhile, somewhat undermined his breakout script by returning to its dysfunctional family themes to far richer, more exploratory, more tonally complex effect in Six Feet Under for cable TV \u2013 the place, some have argued, where American Beauty\u2019s warped sitcom premise belonged to begin with.</p> <p>Not helping its case was that 1999 came to be canonised by critics as a modern landmark year in American cinema, yielding a bounty of innovative, influential milestone works both in the multiplex and indie spheres: from The Matrix to Magnolia, The Sixth Sense to Being John Malkovich, Eyes Wide Shut to Election, Fight Club to The Talented Mr Ripley. (The latter, of course, was the jewel in Weinstein\u2019s crown that year; of course he set it aside for The Cider House Rules when it came to awards campaigning.)

By that token, it works a charm: view Spacey\u2019s brilliantly icky-droll performance not as an exercise in misplaced heroism, but as a grim, complicit prophet of an even more dishonest, self-serving era of American patriarchy to come. Spacey\u2019s uncovered private life makes the joke a bit sicker, admittedly, but damn if he isn\u2019t pitch perfect in this.</p> <p>There are, of course, false notes aplenty, ones more critics ought to have spotted even then: Annette Bening\u2019s unhinged virtuosity only goes so far towards concealing what an ungenerous, ill-thought con the character of Carolyn Burnham is, not so much an empty woman as an empty construct. The teenage characters are all emo and no real emotion, vessels for the film\u2019s sweetest but thinnest stabs at profundity. (American Beauty is a film that feels most authentic when it\u2019s least sincere.) And that script I loved so much, for all its smart, savoury dialogue, is built on diagrammatic ironies \u2013 the homophobic military man\u2019s a closet case, the self-styled slutty girl\u2019s a virgin \u2013 that all ring a bit screenwriting 101, whatever truths are embedded within.</p> <p>And yet, and yet.

But it also moves me on its own terms and merits, its own sly critique of a fragile milieu, its own pristinely art-directed yin-yang of sadness and sarcasm, its own vulnerable but defensively lacquered performances. Hell, I still think all the rose petal business is woozily beautiful. Twenty years on, American Beauty isn\u2019t as clever as we thought it was, though it\u2019s inadvertently aged into a kind of wounded, embattled wisdom. Perhaps it\u2019s worth looking closer.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>What\u2019s going for it?</strong> Grander than you might think, Lancaster, if you think about it at all. Only intrepid tour coaches make it this far, leaving this slightly forgotten city of excellent pubs, doughty inhabitants and beautiful buildings largely for the Lancastrians. Its severe castle, high on the hill, looks ripped enough to withstand a meteorite, while the streets and squares below, curling round the foot of Castle Hill and spreading up to Dalton Square and the Town Hall, are thick with columned porticoes, churches and stone Georgian townhouses. This grandeur came at a cost, of course, one mostly paid by slaves. Lancaster was once the fourth largest slave trade port in England after London, Liverpool and Bristol, a fact it finally acknowledged in 2005 with a memorial to the millions amid the warehouses and wharves on St George\u2019s Quay. Far more searing, though, is a tiny 18th-century grave to a slave who died soon after arriving, lonely amid salt marshes by the seashore just outside the city, at Sunderland Point. Residents and schoolchildren tend it still, with flowers and painted stones.</p> <p><strong>The case against\u2026</strong> More could be made of the city\u2019s riverfront; and recent developments and buildings don\u2019t live up to the city\u2019s heritage.</p> <p><strong>Well connected?</strong> Trains: on the west coast mainline to Preston (16-20 mins) and Manchester (1hr). Driving: the M6 swoops past, making Preston 40 mins away, Blackpool 50 mins, the Lakes or the Dales 40 mins and Manchester 70 mins.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s going for it? Grander than you might think, Lancaster, if you think about it at all. Only intrepid tour coaches make it this far, leaving this slightly forgotten city of excellent pubs, doughty inhabitants and beautiful buildings largely for the Lancastrians. Its severe castle, high on the hill, looks ripped enough to withstand a meteorite, while the streets and squares below, curling round the foot of Castle Hill and spreading up to Dalton Square and the Town Hall, are thick with columned porticoes, churches and stone Georgian townhouses. This grandeur came at a cost, of course, one mostly paid by slaves. Lancaster was once the fourth largest slave trade port in England after London, Liverpool and Bristol, a fact it finally acknowledged in 2005 with a memorial to the millions amid the warehouses and wharves on St George\u2019s Quay. Far more searing, though, is a tiny 18th-century grave to a slave who died soon after arriving, lonely amid salt marshes by the seashore just outside the city, at Sunderland Point. Residents and schoolchildren tend it still, with flowers and painted stones. The case against\u2026 More could be made of the city\u2019s riverfront; and recent developments and buildings don\u2019t live up to the city\u2019s heritage. Well connected? Trains: on the west coast mainline to Preston (16-20 mins) and Manchester (1hr). Driving: the M6 swoops past, making Preston 40 mins away, Blackpool 50 mins, the Lakes or the Dales 40 mins and Manchester 70 mins. The beach at Morecambe is 10 minutes down the road. Schools Primaries: alongside many rated \u201cgood\u201d by Ofsted, Scotforth St Paul\u2019s CofE and St Bernadette\u2019s Catholic are \u201coutstanding\u201d. Secondaries: Central Lancaster High and Our Lady\u2019s Catholic are \u201cgood\u201d, with Ripley St Thomas CofE, Lancaster Girls\u2019 Grammar and Lancaster Royal Grammar (boys) \u201coutstanding\u201d. Hang out at\u2026 The Borough is the local star, fine in its Georgian splendour. The Sun pulls an excellent pint. Where to buy The old heart of Georgian houses, grand and humble, tumbles down from the castle. Glorious to explore. There\u2019s a dense ring of Victorian properties, too, around the centre and on the roads out of town \u2013 for example, off Greaves and Scotforth Roads south and west. A nice little nugget of houses is to be found by the river, around Portland Road. Also south, near the university campus.

He asked: </p> \n  <p><em>You\u2019ve got five weeks left to get a Brexit deal, can you update us on what you think is the latest probability of finding an agreement that the DUP can get behind? And secondly, you called David Cameron \u2018a girly swot\u2019, are you a little bit be worried what he might call you in his upcoming memoirs? </em></p> \n  <p>On the first part, Johnson replied: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On where we are with Brexit, I think people do deserve to know what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re working incredibly hard to get a deal, there is the rough shape of a deal to be done. I myself have been to talk to various other EU leaders, particularly in Germany, in France, and in Ireland, where we made a good deal of progress. I\u2019m seeing the president of the [European] commission, and the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Monday, and we\u2019ll talk about the ideas that we\u2019ve been working on. And we\u2019ll see where we get. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic.

What it says is contrary to the position, which we have adopted throughout these negotiations. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd it runs contrary to what the government is saying, because the government has made it quite clear that it will not accept an arrangement which has a backstop, which separates Northern Ireland out from the rest United Kingdom.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But Wilson conceded that there had been \u201cdifferent attitude\u201d in the talks this week between Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar. </p> \n  <p>He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We want to see a deal, the UK government wants to see a deal. And I think that as the deadline approaches, the Irish government recognise the damage to their economy if they don\u2019t try and get some arrangement with the UK, because they have a significant stake in keeping the UK market open for their exporters.</p> \n   <p>We have always said that there are alternative means by which the border can be policed without creating the hard border.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked whether the DUP was open to allowing some EU legislation to apply in Northern Ireland, Wilson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That\u2019s something that we said to the prime minister ... that where it was appropriate and EU legislation was necessary to keep the free flow of trade across the Irish border, especially in the agrifood industry, and where it didn\u2019t damage our relationships with our biggest market in GB, then, of course, that\u2019s the kind of thing that the North Ireland assembly should be open to consider, and that would not be opposed to that kind of arrangement. But that\u2019s different from giving carte blanche to the EU and saying whatever regulations you introduced in the future will automatically apply to Northern Ireland whether they\u2019re good for Northern Ireland, or whether they damage the Northern Ireland economy. We\u2019ve all been reasonable, as far as this is concerned, because we understand that there are there are industry interests, and that there are good reasons why cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is beneficial on occasions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-13T08:33:35.707Z\">at 9.33am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7b47328f08143ee1ae57ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-13T07:48:29.085Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"17d5578e3e83dbc5951225d24287224afb79edf1\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17d5578e3e83dbc5951225d24287224afb79edf1/420_272_1001_1251/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bernard Jenkin\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernard Jenkin</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McAndrew/UK Parliament/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The senior Conservative MP and leading Brexiter Bernard Jenkin has launched an attack on John Bercow accusing him of being \u201cpartisan\u201d and holding too much power.</p> \n  <p>He was responding to the Speaker\u2019s warning that parliament would use \u201cprocedural creativity\u201d to stop a no-deal Brexit in a speech which he also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/12/bercow-warns-pm-not-to-defy-law-on-no-deal-brexit\">likened Boris Johnson to a bank robber.</a></p> \n  <p>Jenkin told to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe office of Speaker has become irretrievably politicised and radicalised.

A speech to northern politicians and business leaders in Rotherham was interrupted by a man who urged him to get back to parliament to sort out the mess he had created. Earlier a woman in Doncaster confronted Boris Johnson face-to-face and accused him of telling fairytales about spending and Brexit. Scotland Yard has announced that no further action will be taken against Leave.EU, the Brexit campaign founded by businessman Arron Banks and spearheaded by Nigel Farage. It said there had been \u201ctechnical breaches\u201d of electoral law but insufficient evidence to justify any further criminal investigation. Johnson will head to Luxembourg on Monday to meet Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier to try to break the Brexit impasse. The prime minister said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about getting a deal. Jo Swinson has ruled out backing a Jeremy Corbyn-led government after a general election, saying the Liberal Democrats could not even have an informal support arrangement with Labour, despite recent cooperation to block a no-deal Brexit. Major policy differences and serious personal worries about Corbyn and Johnson meant she could not support either in government, Swinson told the Guardian. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said the \u201cgap is very wide\u201d between the EU and the UK on Brexit. The taoiseach said he got the impression that Johnson was serious about a deal after their meeting on Monday in Dublin but what the UK was talking about \u201cfalls very far short\u201d of what is required for a deal. The Democratic Unionist party has played down a report that it is softening its line on a Northern Ireland-only backstop. Its leader, Arlene Foster, and its Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, both described as \u201cnonsense\u201d a Times story claiming the DUP was dropping its objection to a border in the Irish Sea. Support for Welsh independence would soar if it meant Wales could remain in the EU, a new poll suggests. According to the YouGov poll commissioned by Plaid Cymru, 41% of those who expressed a preference would back independence if it led to Wales remaining in the EU. The Brexit party has taken control of Hartlepool borough council after forming a pact with the Conservatives overnight, dealing a significant blow to Labour in the north-east of England. The party announced it had taken control of the local authority at a council meeting on Thursday night, where it revealed that nine councillors had joined the party and formed a pact with the council\u2019s three Conservatives. The senior Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin has accused John Bercow of wielding a \u201cmajoritarian dictatorship\u201d against Brexit. He called for the Speaker\u2019s powers to be curtailed. The election of the new Speaker will take place on Monday 4 November. Bercow, who has held the office since 2009, will take the chair for tge final time on Thursday 31 October. In response to the decision by the Metropolitan police not to take any further action against Leave.EU, its financial backer Arron Banks has called for the resignation of the head of the Electoral Commission, Bob Posner, and the chair of the Commons\u2019 culture committee, Damian Collins. In a statement Banks said: The disgraceful political collusion between the Electoral Commission and the Damian Collins \u2018remain-biased\u2019 DCMS committee and a number of leading remain MPs, demonstrates a serious abuse of public office and we will be demanding a full public inquiry investigation into their actions. We will be writing to the prime minster today demanding a public inquiry into the actions of the Electoral Commission. I am today calling for the resignation of Damian Collins and the CEO of Electoral Commission as a result of today\u2019s news. The Electoral Commission have serious questions to answer about political bias and whether it is fit for purpose as a regulator. The management board is overseen by third-rate politicos and people who have shown clear political bias. The chairman himself described Brexit as a \u201ccollection of Eurosceptic nonsense\u201d and one of the EC board called for a second referendum. The investigation has taken a huge personal toll on Liz Bilney, her family and the harassment and lies perpetrated by anti-Brexit MPs is disgraceful. MPs like Stephen and Ian Lavery should apologise to Liz and the 1.5 million supporters of Leave.EU they tried to smear. During the last two years, the Metropolitan police have been professional and thorough. They spent many hours investigating our case and they should be commended for doing a difficult job in a difficult political climate. They remained impartial and operated with complete integrity. \u201cWe would like to thank the Metropolitan police commissioner for giving her officers her full support at all times. Here\u2019s video of Johnson being challenged in Doncaster. Here\u2019s a summary of Johnson\u2019s trip to Yorkshire: The prime minister has been challenged by voters in Doncaster and Rotherham. A speech to northern politicians and business leaders in Rotherham was interrupted by a man who urged him to get back to parliament to sort out the mess he had created. Earlier a woman in Doncaster confronted Johnson face-to-face and accused him of telling fairytales about spending and Brexit. \u201cPeople have died because of austerity, and you\u2019ve got the cheek to come here and tell us austerity\u2019s over and it\u2019s all good now,\u201d she said. Johnson insisted he won\u2019t be deterred by political turmoil from delivering Brexit by the 31 October deadline. He said: \u201cWhatever the shenanigans that may be going on at Westminster we will get on with delivering our agenda and preparing to take this country out of the EU on October 31st.\u201d Johnson confirmed he will be meeting Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and the EU\u2019s chief negotiator for Brexit talks on Monday. He said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about reaching a deal. The prime minister refused to commit to various northern projects, including Yorkshire devolution, a Leeds mass transit system and extra spending in Sheffield. \u201cI\u2019m reluctant to make more spending commitments,\u201d he admitted. Johnson denied accusing police forces of \u201cspaffing money up the wall\u201d on historical child abuse cases, six months after telling LBC just that. He said he wanted police to concentrate on fighting crime. In his speech, Johnson announced plans to devolve transport powers for fares, stations and rolling stock. \u201cIt is time for the north to run its own trains,\u201d he said. In the Q&amp;A with journalists, the best questions came from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. He asked: You\u2019ve got five weeks left to get a Brexit deal, can you update us on what you think is the latest probability of finding an agreement that the DUP can get behind? And secondly, you called David Cameron \u2018a girly swot\u2019, are you a little bit be worried what he might call you in his upcoming memoirs? On the first part, Johnson replied: On where we are with Brexit, I think people do deserve to know what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re working incredibly hard to get a deal, there is the rough shape of a deal to be done. I myself have been to talk to various other EU leaders, particularly in Germany, in France, and in Ireland, where we made a good deal of progress. I\u2019m seeing the president of the [European] commission, and the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Monday, and we\u2019ll talk about the ideas that we\u2019ve been working on. And we\u2019ll see where we get. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. But whatever happens we will come out on October 31st. To the second, he said: Absolutely nothing that David Cameron says in his memoirs, in the course of the next few days, will diminish the affection and respect in which I hold him. Not least for what he did in turning this country around after Labour left it bankrupt, and delivering a jobs miracle in the UK, record low unemployment. I think he has a very distinguished record and a legacy to be proud of. While Johnson was speaking, Scotland Yard announced that no further action will be taken against Leave.EU, the Brexit campaign founded by businessman Arron Banks and spearheaded by Nigel Farage. A Met statement said: \u201cOn 5 August 2019 the MPS submitted a file to the CPS for Early Investigative Advice in relation to the Leave.EU investigation and this advice has now been received. \u201cIt is clear that whilst some technical breaches of electoral law were committed by Leave.EU in respect of the spending return submitted for their campaign, there is insufficient evidence to justify any further criminal investigation. \u201cLeave.EU\u2019s responsible person has been has been told that they will face no further police action.\u201d The force said investigations into the spending returns of Vote Leave and BeLeave were ongoing. Here\u2019s a fuller transcript of Johnson\u2019s response to both the heckler and a question from a journalist about how he can deliver various promises when he can\u2019t get an election and Brexit done. Johnson said: I certainly won\u2019t be deterred by anybody from our goal of coming out of the EU on October 31st. I think the people of this country want us to get Brexit done. But I also won\u2019t be deterred with getting on with our domestic agenda. I\u2019m a passionate believer in devolution and in giving power to strong local leaders to champion their areas and to be accountable for their transport networks. Whatever the shenanigans that may be going on at Westminster we will get on with delivering our agenda and preparing to take this country out of the EU on October 31st. And there will be ample time for parliament to consider the deal that I very much hope to do at the EU summit on October 17th and 18th. To the gentleman who left prematurely, not necessarily under his own steam, that is the answer to his question. To have a Queen\u2019s speech and to set out our domestic agenda, we\u2019ve lost about four days of parliamentary sitting time. There\u2019s ample time for parliament to consider not just Brexit but all kinds of things both before and after the European council on October 17th so lets get on and do it. Q: You called David Cameron a \u2018girly swot\u2019 are you worried about what he\u2019ll say in his memoirs? Nothing Cameron writes in his memoirs diminish the affection and respect in which I hold him, Johnson says. Q: What\u2019s the probability of a Brexit deal? We\u2019re working incredibly hard. We\u2019ve made a good deal of progress, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where we get\u201d on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic, but whatever happens we will come out on October 31st.\u201d Q: Will you commit to mass transit system in Leeds? Oh God, Johnson says. I want to do it, Leeds should have a mass transit system, but I\u2019m not going to commit to a budget to it today. Q: Are you committed to Yorkshire devolution. Further work needs to be done on that, Johnson says, acknowledging different views. Q: Why has Sheffield been underfunded? I\u2019ve just but \u00a33.6bn into towns, Johnson says before admitting it won\u2019t apply to Sheffield. I\u2019m reluctant to make more spending commitments, he says. Q: Do you still think police forces are \u2018spaffing up the wall\u2019 on historical child abuse allegations? That\u2019s not what I said, Johnson said. I want to see police officers fighting crime, he added. Fact check by my boss: Q: Why did you delay the domestic abuse bill? The bill is certainly going to be carried over. It will be right there in the Queen\u2019s speech, Johnson says. In the Q&amp;A Johnson says political uncertainty won\u2019t put him off getting Brexit done by 31 October. He also repeats that there will be \u201cample time\u201d to debate Brexit, in response to the heckler. Johnson confirms plans to devolve transport to regions in the north. \u201cIt is time for the north to run its own trains,\u201d he says. This will involve powers over fares, stations and rolling stock, Johnson says. The arrangement will involve a partnership between the railways and the north. Johnson comes up with a better joke about pacer trains. Here\u2019s video of that heckler: Helen Pidd, who is in Rotherham, says the heckler was promptly thrown out. Johnson says he is the first prime minister since Clement Attlee to have been a mayor. He then gets heckled about proroguing parliament. The heckler says: \u201cWhy are you not with them in parliament sorting out the mess that you have created?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cI\u2019m very happy to get back to parliament very soon.\u201d Johnson finally starts his speech in Rotherham at the Convention of the North. He starts with a lame joke about Magna, the location for the event, ice cream and latin. Not much laughter. But someone liked it: But a point about a nearby bagel factory also falls flat. Channel 4 News has more from the woman in Doncaster challenging Johnson on spending and his Brexit \u201cfairytale\u201d. She asked: \u201cWhere\u2019s the money coming from now then?\u201d And added: \u201cAll you\u2019re going to do is put the same amount of police on the streets as what you\u2019ve took off.\u201d Boris Johnson has been confronted by a voter in Doncaster who accused him of telling fairytales. She said: \u201cPeople have died because of austerity. And then you\u2019ve got the cheek to come here and tell us austerity is over and it\u2019s all good now, we\u2019re going to leave the EU and everything is going to be great. It\u2019s just a fairytale.\u201d While we wait for Johnson\u2019s speech to the Convention of the North, the FT has a preview. It says he will announce that elected mayors in the north of England will be given London-style powers over their railway budgets and timetables. Jo Swinson has ruled out backing a Jeremy Corbyn-led government after a general election, saying the Liberal Democrats could not even have an informal support arrangement with Labour, despite recent cooperation to block a no-deal Brexit. Speaking ahead of her first Lib Dem conference as party leader, Swinson said she favoured \u201cpluralist politics\u201d and cross-party working such as that which saw opposition MPs group together to force a Brexit extension and block an election. Before his speech to the Convention of the North, Boris Johnson has been visiting Doncaster market. PA said he purchased a cob loaf and English fruit and joked with one lobster seller: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take a few claws out of that withdrawal agreement.\u201d He told one trader \u201cwe\u2019re going to get a deal\u201d, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s the plan, anyway. And if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re coming out on October 31. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Here we go, that\u2019s democracy.\u201d He showed no reaction as one man told him: \u201cFind a deal here \u2013 this is Doncaster, not Europe.\u201d The DUP could be willing to shift its red lines on Brexit if it had a legally binding \u201cStormont lock\u201d which would give the Northern Ireland assembly a say on alignment with EU rules, sources say. Arlene Foster, the party leader, has dismissed as \u201cnonsense\u201d reports that the party had said it would accept Northern Ireland abiding by some European Union rules after Brexit in a deal to replace the Irish backstop. But sources do not rule out the possibility of a deal, if were it backed up by a legally binding guarantee for the DUP. They point to paragraph 50 of the December 2017 joint report saying it is the \u201cglue\u201d that could hold all sides together. At issue is the importance of keeping the Irish border invisible. In the backstop arrangement outlined in Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal, Northern Ireland would remain in regulatory alignment with the republic until a wider trade deal was struck which included solutions for the frontier. Paragraph 50 of the joint report was inserted at the last minute after May ceded to demands by the DUP to prevent checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It says that in the absence of a Brexit deal, \u201cno new regulatory barriers develop between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom\u201d unless, in line with the 1998 peace deal, Stormont agrees \u201cthat distinct arrangements are appropriate for Northern Ireland\u201d. \u201cParagraph 50 is the glue that will hold any deal together that will get approval from the DUP,\u201d said one source. The DUP dismissed the Stormont lock as \u201ccosmetic and meaningless\u201d when it was first proposed in January, because it was not legally binding. The EU has said it is opposed to giving Stormont a legally binding veto, but there is widespread feeling that a space has opened up to crash-test the DUP\u2019s red lines and this is why reports are emerging about the party potentially softening its stance. Earlier this week the new EU trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, indicated there would be room for manoeuvre. A longstanding ally of Leo Varadkar, he told RTE that if \u201cthere are constitutional issues that are already in the withdrawal agreement that might have to be improved upon, if this is a request that\u2019s made, of course we can look at it\u201d. Hogan also said he detected a shift in Johnson\u2019s position also: \u201cI also note that the British prime minister has moved away from his position \u2026 where he\u2019s now prepared to look at divergence of certain rules and regulations on the island of Ireland vis-a-vis the United Kingdom. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s movement happening on both sides. Let\u2019s see over the next four weeks how we can advance those intensive negotiations to reach an agreement.\u201d Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far today: Boris Johnson will head to Luxembourg on Monday to meet Jean-Claude Juncker for the first time in an attempt to break the Brexit impasse. The prime minister will hold his first face-to-face talks at a \u201cworking lunch\u201d hosted by Juncker. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said the \u201cgap is very wide\u201d between the EU and the UK on Brexit. The taoiseach said he got the impression that Johnson was serious about a deal following their meeting on Monday in Dublin but what the UK was talking about \u201cfalls very far short\u201d of what is required for a deal. The DUP has played down a report that it is softening its line on a Northern Ireland only backstop. Its leader, Arlene Foster, and its Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, both described as \u201cnonsense\u201d a Times story claiming the DUP was dropping its objection to a border in the Irish Sea. Johnson is continuing his unofficial election campaign with another trip to Labour\u2019s northern heartlands. In a speech in Rotherham he is expected to promise northern communities \u201ccontrol over the things that matter to them\u201d, and a new Northern Powerhouse growth body to drive the region\u2019s economy. Support for Welsh independence would soar if it meant that Wales could remain in the EU, a new poll suggests. According to the YouGov poll commissioned by Plaid Cymru, 41% of those who expressed a preference would back independence if it led to Wales remaining in the EU. The Brexit party has taken control of Hartlepool borough council after forming a pact with the Conservatives overnight, dealing a significant blow to Labour in the north-east of England. The party announced it had taken control of the local authority at a council meeting on Thursday night, where it revealed that nine councillors had joined the party and formed a pact with the council\u2019s three Conservatives. The senior Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin has accused John Bercow of wielding a \u201cmajoritarian dictatorship\u201d against Brexit. He called for the Speaker\u2019s powers to be curtailed. The election of the new Speaker will take place on Monday 4 November. Bercow, who has held the office since 2009, will take the chair for a final time on Thursday 31 October. The Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp has some puzzled Brussels reaction to that Johnson/Juncker meeting. The prime minister will hold his first face-to-face talks at a lunch hosted by Juncker in the European commission president\u2019s home country, where he was prime minister for 18 years. Johnson will then hold talks with the current prime minister of Luxembourg, Xavier Bettel. EU sources suggested Johnson had sought to avoid a meeting in Brussels for fear of giving the impression that the new prime minister was begging for concessions. A European commission spokeswoman said Juncker would meet Johnson for a \u201cworking lunch\u201d. The spokeswoman said the location had been chosen by \u201ccommon accord\u201d and that it would allow Juncker the benefit of going straight from the talks to Strasbourg, where the European parliament is sitting next week. She declined to disclose details about the precise location of the meeting. \u201cYou can imagine it is somewhere where they serve food,\u201d the spokeswoman said. The new communications team in Downing Street is understood to believe that Theresa May undermined herself in the public eye by making dashes to Brussels to seek movement in the negotiation. Johnson had hinted at plans for further meetings with EU leaders next week. His first visits in August to Berlin and Paris to meet the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, were widely seen as a success. The election of the new Speaker of the House of Commons will take place on Monday 4 November, the House of Commons has announced, according to PA. The current Speaker, John Bercow, who has held the office since June 22 2009, will take the chair for a final time on Thursday 31 October. Bercow will formally resign as an MP on Monday 4 November. The election of a new Speaker will be presided over by the father of the house, the Conservative MP Ken Clarke. Nominations of candidates must be submitted between 9.30am and 10.30am on Monday 4 November, with the house proceeding immediately to the election when business begins at 2.30pm. Candidates will each address MPs in an order selected by ballot, before MPs vote in secret. Successive ballots will be held until either a candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, or only one candidate remains. The successful candidate \u2013 who will then become the Speaker elect \u2013 will attend the lords commissioners in the House of Lords to receive royal approbation. Johnson is due to hold a \u201cworking lunch\u201d with Juncker in Luxembourg on Monday, according to the European commission. A spokeswoman said: \u201cPresident Juncker will hold a working lunch with the prime minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson. This working lunch will take place in Luxembourg.\u201d AFP\u2019s Danny Kemp reminds us that Juncker\u2019s working lunches can also be liquid lunches. Downing Street has told lobby journalists that Boris Johnson will meet EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker in Luxembourg on Monday. The announcement is likely to fuel speculation of a possible deal, despite claims by the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier that there is no grounds for optimism about a possible breakthrough. The far-right activist Tommy Robinson is reported to have been released from prison after serving nine weeks of a nine-month sentence for contempt of court. Speculation about the prospects of a new Brexit deal has boosted the value of the pound, Bloomberg reports. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said the \u201cgap is very wide\u201d between the EU and the UK on Brexit. The taoiseach said he got the impression that Boris Johnson was serious about a deal following their meeting on Monday in Dublin but what the UK was talking about \u201cfalls very far short\u201d of what is required for a deal. Asked whether he trusted Johnson he said: \u201cI do, I believe when he says he wants a deal on Brexit, he is acting in good faith and our teams are in contact and we are exploring what is possible. \u201cThe gap is very wide but we will fight for and work for no no deal until the last moment, but not at any cost, and at the same time we are preparing the country for no deal if we end up in that scenario,\u201d he said. He was speaking at the Fine Gael annual think-in in Cork on Friday. Varadkar told RTE that while some customs checks could be required close to the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government had yet to identify locations. Sammy Wilson has repeated his leader, Arlene Foster\u2019s line that the Times story about the DUP softening its line on an Northern Ireland only backstop is \u201cnonsense\u201d. The odds of a no-deal exit have increased over the last week despite parliament\u2019s determination to prevent such an outcome, according to the Eurasia group thinktank. Its boss Mujtaba walks us through what the group reckons is likely to happen over the next few weeks. Support for Welsh independence will soar if it meant that Wales could remain in the EU, a poll suggests. According to the YouGov poll commissioned by Plaid Cymru, 41% of those who expressed a preference would back independence if it led to Wales remaining in the EU. The poll follows rallies in Cardiff, Caernarfon and \u2013 last weekend - Merthyr Tydfil where 8,000 people marched in support of independence. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price AM said: \u201cThese are sensational figures which put support for Plaid Cymru\u2019s ambition of securing Welsh independence at a historic high. \u201cWestminster is in turmoil. Boris Johnson\u2019s reckless Tory government and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s chaotic so-called opposition are wrecking Wales\u2019s future. \u201cIt is no wonder that we are witnessing a surge in support for a new Wales \u2013 a nation proudly taking its place as an equal partner on the international stage. \u201cIndependence is moving from the margins to the mainstream. Our nation is on the march. As Boris Johnson takes us closer to the cliff edge, more and more people will demand an outward looking Wales free from Westminster\u2019s contempt.\u201d Total sample size was 1,039 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken between 6-10 September. The survey was carried out online. Confused about a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Here\u2019s an explainer. The Brexit party has taken control of Hartlepool borough council after forming a pact with the Conservatives overnight, dealing a significant blow to Labour in its north-east heartlands. Labour lost overall control of the council in May when its leader blamed \u201ca divided party\u201d nationally for it haemorrhaging votes in the heavily leave-voting town. Hartlepool becomes the first council under the control of the Brexit party in the UK and a boost to the party in the north-east, where Nigel Farage is fighting hard to make inroads. The Brexit party announced it had taken control of the local authority at a council meeting on Thursday night, where it revealed that nine councillors had joined the party and formed a pact with the council\u2019s three Conservatives. The Brexit party-Conservative coalition now has 13 councillors on the 32-seat council, compared with Labour\u2019s 10. Of the nine new Brexit party councillors, six sat as independents (four of whom were ex-Ukip) plus three defectors who until last night represented Ukip, Putting Hartlepool First and the Veterans and People\u2019s party respectively. One of the new Brexit party councillors, Shane Moore, said on Friday the move was about \u201csending an absolutely clear message to those nationally who would frustrate the result of the referendum\u201d. Moore, who quit Ukip last year and previously sat as a Conservative councillor, said he had no intention of joining the Brexit party until the past fortnight when MPs voted to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that in Westminster, remain parties and remain groups are clubbing together to form an alliance to put Brexit at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt that, in conjunction with our Conservative colleagues, we needed to form an alliance of our own and send a very clear message to those people \u2013 and especially to the Labour party locally \u2013 that they need to stop playing games. \u201cThey need to listen and respect the result of the referendum. If they don\u2019t, a formal leave alliance should and will be formed to tackle them head-on and deliver the result.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn has urged people to register to vote. As a spur he claims that Boris Johnson team have admitted they want to fix the date of the election to make it harder for people to register. Meanwhile, Momentum is launching a new digital tool for students to decide whether to vote at university or at home in an effort to drive up the Labour vote in marginal seas. Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat \u2013 home to students of Brunel University London \u2013 will be targeted by the campaign group who believe they can overturn the prime minister\u2019s 5,000-strong majority. The new tool will allow students to put in both their home and university postcodes and will indicate which location will ultimately be more advantageous to register to vote in order to enable a Labour victory. Here\u2019s some highbrow reaction to Bernard Jenkin\u2019s claim that that Speaker Bercow is leading a \u201cmajoritarian dictatorship\u201d against Brexit (see earlier). Here\u2019s more from that Sammy Wilson interview rejecting the Times report that DUP is softening its stance on the Irish backstop. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said: \u201cThe Times article is totally untrue. It\u2019s an unsourced article. What it says is contrary to the position, which we have adopted throughout these negotiations. \u201cAnd it runs contrary to what the government is saying, because the government has made it quite clear that it will not accept an arrangement which has a backstop, which separates Northern Ireland out from the rest United Kingdom.\u201d But Wilson conceded that there had been \u201cdifferent attitude\u201d in the talks this week between Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar. He said: We want to see a deal, the UK government wants to see a deal. And I think that as the deadline approaches, the Irish government recognise the damage to their economy if they don\u2019t try and get some arrangement with the UK, because they have a significant stake in keeping the UK market open for their exporters. We have always said that there are alternative means by which the border can be policed without creating the hard border. Asked whether the DUP was open to allowing some EU legislation to apply in Northern Ireland, Wilson said: That\u2019s something that we said to the prime minister ... that where it was appropriate and EU legislation was necessary to keep the free flow of trade across the Irish border, especially in the agrifood industry, and where it didn\u2019t damage our relationships with our biggest market in GB, then, of course, that\u2019s the kind of thing that the North Ireland assembly should be open to consider, and that would not be opposed to that kind of arrangement. But that\u2019s different from giving carte blanche to the EU and saying whatever regulations you introduced in the future will automatically apply to Northern Ireland whether they\u2019re good for Northern Ireland, or whether they damage the Northern Ireland economy. We\u2019ve all been reasonable, as far as this is concerned, because we understand that there are there are industry interests, and that there are good reasons why cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is beneficial on occasions. The senior Conservative MP and leading Brexiter Bernard Jenkin has launched an attack on John Bercow accusing him of being \u201cpartisan\u201d and holding too much power. He was responding to the Speaker\u2019s warning that parliament would use \u201cprocedural creativity\u201d to stop a no-deal Brexit in a speech which he also likened Boris Johnson to a bank robber. Jenkin told to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe office of Speaker has become irretrievably politicised and radicalised. It would have been unthinkable 10 or 15 years ago for the Speaker of the House of Commons to launch a personal attack on the prime minister like this.\u201d Jenkin called for reform of the office of Speaker and claimed that under Bercow, support for Brexit had been marginalised because it was a minority view among MPs. He said: \u201cFor one individual in now what is a contested, televised very public and controversial position to have so much unregulated, untrammelled power, is something that the House of Commons is going to have to look at ... \u201cMaybe I should ask my unconstitutional affairs committee to look at the role of Speaker because it\u2019s clearly not functioning in the way that it used to function until Mr Bercow arrived.\u201d He added: We usually have majority governments, and the Speaker of the House of Commons is there to ensure the protection of minorities. We\u2019ve got a minority government, a very partisan Speaker, and a Speaker who is using the majority and doing nothing to protect the minority. The number of leavers in the House of Commons is vastly outnumbered by the number of MPs who voted remain. And if the speakership is to become a majoritarian office like the speakership in the [US] Congress, is a very different proposition. He\u2019s not subject to any court or any \u2026 it\u2019s a kind of majoritarian dictatorship position. It would be very sensible if the Speaker is going to make a controversial decision, that should be a consensus decision amongst him and his deputies, not just a sole decision. It will be more of a collective. Jenkin also suggested Bercow had resigned as Speaker before he was pushed. He\u2019s avoided personal scrutiny of his own personal behaviour, even though he\u2019s introduced all kinds of new systems to regulate the behaviour of MPs. People have speculated that one of the reasons he\u2019s going is because finally the house has voted to look at the historic cases, which would include his own case. Sammy Wilson MP, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, has also dismissed that Times report, which claimed his party has softened its red lines on a Northern Ireland-only backstop. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said it was \u201ctotally untrue\u201d. According to the Larne Times, Wilson earlier told the BBC: We will not be accepting separate arrangements for Northern Ireland that cut us off from the United Kingdom. The only different arrangements we will accept for Northern Ireland are those where the assembly has total scrutiny of any EU legislation it decides are in the interest of Northern Ireland and doesn\u2019t damage our relationship with the UK. And in those situations we will consider adopting appropriate legislation if we believe it is to the advantage of industry in Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson continues his unofficial election campaign with another trip to Labour\u2019s northern heartlands today. In a speech in Rotherham to the Convention of the North, he is expected to promise northern communities \u201ccontrol over the things that matter to them\u201d, and a new Northern Powerhouse growth body to drive the region\u2019s economy. The speech is due to start at 12.30pm, and will take questions from journalists afterwards, according to Politico\u2019s London Playbook. Meanwhile, politicians from northern England who will gather at the convention have made a joint call for more help for the region. Mayors and city leaders from Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds and Sheffield, along with business leaders, have set out their priorities for the north in a joint article in the Times. It said: To get this country working again, there is an urgent need to take power out of Westminster and give it to our great cities and regions. We need to build a new, healthier politics that unifies people around place and positive change and delivers practical change for citizens. The crisis over Brexit makes this a make or break moment for northern devolution. \u201cTake Back Control\u201d may have been directed at Brussels during the referendum campaign but the reality is that many people were also sending the same message to Westminster. Whilst central government has been stuck in the Brexit mire, we have used devolution to deliver for our local communities on the things that matter to them. So today we are making a new joint call on the government for action in five priority areas. Welcome to another special Friday edition of Politics Live. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has played down a report that her party is softening its opposition to a Northern Ireland-only backstop to help Boris Johnson get a new Brexit deal. The Times claimed the DUP has agreed to shift its red lines on Brexit, saying it could accept Northern Ireland abiding by some European Union rules post-Brexit as part of a new deal to replace the Irish backstop. It reported that the DUP had privately said it would drop its objection to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea, something it had previously said was unacceptable since it would separate Northern Ireland politically and economically from the mainland. In return for such concessions, Brussels would abandon its insistence on Northern Ireland remaining in a customs union with the EU, sources told the paper. But, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, insists that, as previously indicated, any moves which did make Northern Ireland different to the rest of the UK would be unacceptable to the party. In a strongly worded tweet, she suggested the story was \u201cnonsense\u201d. She said: \u201cUK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that divides the internal market of the UK. We will not support any arrangements that create a barrier to East West trade. Anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories.\u201d Meanwhile, the prime minister has been warned against breaking the law over Brexit by the Speaker John Bercow, who said parliament would use \u201cprocedural creativity\u201d to prevent no-deal exit. And the EU\u2019s chief negotiator said there was \u201cno reason to be optimistic\u201d that a new agreement can be brokered before the 31 October deadline. Michel Barnier told political leaders in the European parliament on Thursday that he was unable to say whether contacts with the UK government would result in a deal by mid-October.",

      "bodyText": "The Irish government has cast doubt on suggestions that Northern Ireland\u2019s Stormont assembly could provide the key to unlocking the Brexit impasse. Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister, expressed scepticism about reports that the Democratic Unionist party might sign up to a Northern Ireland-only backstop for the Irish border if the devolved legislature had a veto on future EU rules applying in the region. \u201cThere is certainly a concern at an EU level that a devolved institution in Northern Ireland could have a veto over how the single market operates or a border on the single market operates, so it\u2019s not as straightforward as some people are suggesting,\u201d said Coveney after a two-day party \u201cthink-in\u201d in Cork. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said there was ongoing contact with the DUP and other parties in Northern Ireland, and further talks at government level are believed to be pencilled in for next week. But he said he was not aware of any change in the unionists\u2019 position over their refusal to accept any checks in the Irish Sea as a means of keeping the Irish border invisible. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, dismissed reports it had dropped its red lines and would accept EU regulations in certain circumstances as nonsense. Coveney said there were still no written proposals on the table and this was \u201ca source of real frustration\u201d. \u201cI think you saw that yesterday when you saw [Michel[ Barnier say there is no basis for the reopening of a serious negotiation because there are no proposals coming forward so the next step here is the British government has got to bring forward real proposals in writing that can do the job that the backstop does if they are proposing an alternative,\u201d he said. Under the Northern Ireland-only backstop, regulations in the region would remain aligned to those of the EU even if the UK diverged from EU rules in key areas post-Brexit. This would allow animals, food and other goods to be traded across the border without customs or health checks. The DUP has denounced this as a move to break up the UK, but sources have said they might reconsider if the backstop came with its own backstop \u2013 the so-called \u201cStormont lock\u201d. This would allow the assembly to have a veto on the EU rules that would apply when and if the rest of the UK diverged from EU laws. The DUP dismissed the lock at the time as \u201ccosmetic and meaningless\u201d because it was not legally binding. Some, however, believe that governance by Stormont could be part of the solution if it were crowbarred into the withdrawal agreement. The frustration comes after a week of shuttle diplomacy in which Boris Johnson flew to Dublin for his first face-to-face meeting with Varadkar since he became prime minister. In what appeared to be a shift away for his \u201cdo or die\u201d no-deal policy, Johnson said his overwhelming preference was for a deal, claiming it would be a \u201cfailure of statecraft\u201d for all concerned if they were unable to strike a deal. His change in tone led many to believe the mood music had changed and space had opened up for a deal centring on the original Northern Ireland-only backstop. Phil Hogan, the EU\u2019s new trade commissioner and an ally of Varadkar, said he detected a shift in position offering a glimmer of hope of a deal. \u201cI also note that the British prime minister has moved away from his position \u2026 where he\u2019s now prepared to look at divergence of certain rules and regulations on the island of Ireland vis-a-vis the United Kingdom,\u201d he said. Many believe this could survive only if the backstop were rebranded because it is now considered a toxic term.

King has confirmed that the character is based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Charlie_Howard\">Charlie Howard, an out gay man murdered in King\u2019s home town of Bangor, Maine, in 1984</a> \u2013 who was targeted, in part, because he was wearing a flamboyant hat. By weaving the representation of an actual murder into his story, King suggests It\u2019s horror results from the license some think they have to perpetuate violence. The sequence in the film has proved controversial because some critics, such as Slate\u2019s Jeffrey Bloomer, <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/09/it-chapter-two-homophobic-killing-charlie-howard-opening-scene.html\">consider it exploitative of Howard\u2019s murder</a>. But that\u2019s the point. We\u2019re meant to be shocked by the attack. In the book it happens straight after the murder of a six-year-old, which starts the story\u2019s avenging narrative. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/it-chapter-two-andy-muschietti-jessica-chastain-brutal-hate-crime-1203314628/\">As the film\u2019s star Jessica Chastain told Variety</a>: \u201cWe can\u2019t pretend that it doesn\u2019t still exist because it\u2019s part of our every day\u201d. The murder was completely excised from the home-friendly television miniseries adaptation in 1990.</p> <p>The question is personal for me: on the night in 2017 that I signed a contract to write a book about Stephen King\u2019s It, I was assaulted and left for dead for wearing a flamboyant hat \u2013 a trilby with feathers in it. The attackers asked me if I was queer. </p> <p>The film\u2019s classification rating reveals how audiences are expected to respond to the material, especially with regard to the notional immature, impressionable viewer who may directly imitate the action or identify with the characters. In the UK, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has <a href=\"https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/it-chapter-two-film\">rated it as 15</a>, citing its \u201cstrong gory violence, horror, language, discrimination\u201d, and places the onus on 15-year-olds to govern themselves. But, in truth, this is lopsided: the story contains hate speech aimed at (legally-protected) disability through to (as-yet unprotected) fatphobia, but the BBFC\u2019s guidance focuses only on homophobia: \u201cA young man is subjected to homophobic abuse (\u2018faggot\u2019) before being seriously beaten\u201d and \u201ca young boy being verbally abused in a similar manner.\u201d </p> <p>One of the ratings body\u2019s main concerns is preventing copycat behaviour: the BBFC notes that, to get a 15 rating, \u201cthe work as a whole must not endorse discriminatory language or behaviour, although there may be racist, homophobic or other discriminatory themes and language\u201d. Accordingly, It Chapter Two\u2019s homophobic murder scene discourages discrimination by presenting Adrian and his partner, Don, as heroes. The happy couple are framed against the bright lights of a fairground sky, having given their winnings to a young girl with a facial birth mark. The changes from the book also reinforce this: while in the book, Adrian wears a hat with a flower in it and Don wears skin-tight trousers and lipstick, in the film Adrian\u2019s pink sweater is the only queer-coding. A gang verbally abuses them for talking about their planned future together and demands Adrian remove his novelty fairground hat. Rather than being cowed, film-Adrian (played by Xavier Dolan) delivers his beautifully-pitched Meg quip in a manner of which RuPaul would approve, but is punished for his spark when the assault begins.</p> <p>When Adrian resurfaces, his corpse flirts with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/13/bill-hader-im-a-fraud-i-really-shouldnt-be-here-trainwreck-amy-schumer\">Bill Hader</a>\u2019s Richie, a fan-favourite character whose queerness is suggested by a close-up of a hand held a second too long to be \u201cjust friends\u201d. While this isn\u2019t the Richie of King\u2019s book, the film applauds him for overcoming his internalised homophobia in a happy ending where he recarves his and his first love\u2019s initials into Derry\u2019s \u201cKissing Bridge\u201d. The BBFC rating suggests mature children can understand that the film\u2019s queer portrayals condemn homophobia and promote self-determination.</p> <p>Stephen King\u2019s It balances harsh depictions of realistic violence with the delights of unlikely friendships. King made this point by intertwining Charlie Howard with his fictitious counterparts; through the debate it has caused, the film has widened that dialogue. It has prompted discussions about empathy, and how to dismantle the hate and structural inequality that leads to discrimination in the first place. I was nervous of the sequence because of my own assault, but I\u2019m glad it was included. It validated my perception that the attackers were in the wrong and it gave me hope. By including Adrian, making him a hero and aligning him with Richie\u2019s acceptance of his own sexuality, this modern adaptation of It shows that the world is changing and there\u2019s everything to fight for: we can all be lovers in the end.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The British class system is an organised racket. It concentrates wealth and power in the hands of the few, while 14 million Britons languish in poverty. If you are dim but have rich parents, a life of comfort, affluence and power is almost inevitable \u2013 while the bright but poor are systematically robbed of their potential. The well-to-do are all but guaranteed places at the top table of the media, law, politics, medicine, military, civil service and arts. As inequality grows, so too does the stranglehold of the rich over democracy. The wealthiest 1,000 can double their fortunes in the aftermath of financial calamity, while workers suffer the worst squeeze in wages since the Napoleonic wars. State support is lavished on rich vested interests \u2013 such as the banks responsible for Britain\u2019s economic turmoil \u2013 but stripped from disabled and low-paid people. The powerful have less stressful lives, and the prosperous are healthier, expecting to live a decade longer than those living in the most deprived areas. Unless this rotten system is abolished, Britain will never be free of social and political turmoil. It is therefore welcome \u2013 overdue, in fact \u2013 to read the Daily Telegraph\u2019s horrified front-page story: \u201cCorbyn tax raid on private schools\u201d.

Private education is, in part, a con: past OECD research has suggested that there is not \u201cmuch of a performance difference\u201d between state and private schools when socio-economic background is factored in. In other words, children from richer backgrounds \u2013 because the odds are stacked in their favour from their very conception \u2013 tend to do well, whichever school they\u2019re sent to. However unpalatable it is for some to hear it, many well-to-do parents send their offspring to private schools because they fear them mixing with the children of the poor.

When we don\u2019t sleep well, our amygdala, the emotional part of the brain, is up to 60% more reactive. In other words, we feel anxious, stressed and overreact to everything.

Sir John Saunders, the coroner of the Manchester Arena inquest, said in a ruling published on Friday that certain highly sensitive intelligence would risk national security if it became public. The decision means it is likely the inquest will be converted into a public inquiry, albeit one in which some evidence is heard in private without relatives of the victims or their legal teams. Any coroner\u2019s inquiry will take place after the trial of Hashem Abedi, the brother of the bomber, Salman Abedi, which will begin at the Old Bailey in London on 11 November. Families of the victims told a hearing earlier this month that transparency in the inquest was essential, amid concerns that some of the sensitive MI5 and police evidence highlighted \u201cshortcomings\u201d of the security services. John Cooper QC, who represents several of the families, said at a previous hearing: \u201cNational security may not be the concern, but instead national humiliation.\u201d However, Saunders said he was satisfied that disclosing certain evidence would present a grave threat to national security. The coroner gave no detail about what information he was keeping secret but said it \u201cwould assist terrorists in carrying out the sort of atrocities committed in Manchester and would make it less likely that the security service and the CT [counter-terrorism] police would be able to prevent them\u201d. Saunders added: \u201cThe risk which is identified in each case is that disclosure of the information will make it easier for terrorists to kill people by avoiding detection before they are able to carry [out] an attack.\u201d Having decided that some evidence should not be made public, the coroner said his \u201cprovisional view is that an adequate investigation \u2026 could not be conducted within the framework of the inquests\u201d. It is understood Saunders would now consider converting the inquest into a public inquiry at a hearing in Manchester on 7 October. If that happened, it is likely that two reports would be produced at the end of the public inquiry; one that discussed the secret evidence and a public report that did not.

Closed hearings, secret justice, may do the opposite.\u201d A parliamentary watchdog concluded last year that there were a \u201cnumber of failures\u201d by police and MI5 in the run-up to the Arena bomb, which killed 23 people including Salman Abedi, and injured hundreds more on 22 May 2017. That investigation found that Abedi, a subject of interest to MI5 but not under active investigation, had been flagged for review by the security service but its systems \u201cmoved too slowly\u201d and the review did not happen before the attack.",

      "bodyText": "The US government\u2019s investigations into big tech widened on Friday as lawmakers announced they were seeking internal documents from Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. Letters went out to the four companies on Friday from the leaders of the House judiciary committee and its subcommittee on antitrust, which has been conducting a sweeping antitrust investigation of the companies and their effect on competition and consumers. Among the dozens of executives named in the requests are Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, and Google\u2019s Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt. Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, said: \u201cThe open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online. \u201cBut there is growing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications.\u201d The investigation represents a rare example of bipartisan cooperation. Doug Collins, the senior Republican on the House committee, said: \u201cThis information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues and whether or not our antitrust laws need improvement to better promote competition in the digital markets.\u201d The investigation is likely to lead to the release of potentially embarrassing internal documents and high-profile public hearings involving some of the biggest names in tech. The letters seek information about the ways in which the tech giants have built their businesses, how they shape the search results that consumers see and how other businesses interact with their services. The companies have said they will cooperate fully with the congressional investigation. The lawmakers set a 14 October deadline for the companies to provide the documents. Nadler said the documents will help the committee understand \u201cwhether they are using their market power in ways that have harmed consumers and competition\u201d. The justice department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are also conducting investigations of the companies. The latest moves come after dozens of US states launched privacy and antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google. Associated Press contributed to this report",

Look out for them not becoming the first visiting team to win a top-flight game at Anfield since April 2017.</p> <p><strong>Manchester United v Leicester City: </strong>Without a number of key players for a match many expect them to lose, even before Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw, among others, were ruled out through knack, look out for the first murmurings of anti-Solskj\u00e6r dissent from the Old Trafford stands, as Lord Ferg purses his lips and gives a barely perceptible shake of the head in response to Jamie Vardy standing, both ears cupped in front of the Stretford End after scoring his hat-trick.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/13/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Sheffield United v Southampton: </strong>The Fiver will be looking out for Blades fans complaining about highlights of this particular game getting bottom-billing on Match of the Day due in no small part to London media bias against teams that use over-lapping centre-halves.</p> <p><strong>Brighton v Burnley: </strong>Two sides whose results so far this season have mirrored each other go toe to toe. Look out for a draw, in the interests of symmetry.</p> <p><strong>Wolves v Chelsea: </strong>There will be goals.

The Fiver invites you to spend Monday morning focusing on how wrong we got our previous nine forecasts before belittling us for our lack of prescience in Monday\u2019s letters, then taking the rest of the day off.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t get congratulated by the owner after winning the cup. When I went to Singapore to see him on 19 July, he congratulated me for qualifying for [Big Cup] and not for the Copa del Rey victory. I\u2019m sure you can understand my surprise. I\u2019m absolutely certain that the smoking gun of this situation was the Copa. During the season we got messages from above and other people that we should just leave the Copa. The fans wanted us to go for the cup, so did the players. They wanted to fight for the cup and had the conviction to win it. The coaching team, too. Winning it was definitely the detonator for this situation. Who\u2019d have thought it?\u201d \u2013 in what sounds a bit like Father\u2019s Ted\u2019s Golden Cleric awards speech, minus the liars bit, Marcelino gives his former employer at Valencia, Peter Lim, a bit of a verbal roistering.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3922fac08bd54e6945579d5b4a96490664d1ef04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3922fac08bd54e6945579d5b4a96490664d1ef04/0_0_5651_3768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018And now, where are you, Father Eamonn Hunter \u2026\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018And now, where are you, Father Eamonn Hunter \u2026\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ana Escobar/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cFew of us living in the Bahamas post-Dorian will have much sympathy for the Napoli players who will have to change, by jings, in a unfinished changing room (yesterday\u2019s Fiver). Carlo Ancelotti says there are \u2018no words\u2019. But there are. Spoiled brats who have been paid too much for too long to retain any sense of normal context are the words. Oh, and Carlo, the next time a builder asks you, with one eyebrow raised, how much you <em>really </em>want the construction finished, do remember he is not asking for a completion date. Hope this helps\u201d \u2013 Charles Tuchel.</p> <p>\u201cRe: terrible pitches (Fiver passim). In the 1980s we played at one in Kawerau, New Zealand, on land that had been recently used as the rubbish tip, before a few tonnes of soil and a bit of grass seed was applied and the place repurposed as a \u2018stadium\u2019. Prior to kick-off, both teams had to walk the pitch in a line, picking up any bits of bottles, scrap iron or old cars that might have worked up to the surface. Worryingly we were also asked, in all seriousness, whether we had had recent tetanus shots\u201d \u2013 Rod de Lisle.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2011 I got married. When asked by my atypically considerate best man what I wanted to do on my stag do, I said I wanted nothing more than a game of football followed by an evening in a decent pub. Having opted to host the festivities in rural Somerset my best man, for reasons I never fully grasped, dutifully spent the evenings of several weeks going to a relative\u2019s field usually reserved for grazing dairy cows, with a heavy roller so as to transform the field of summer baked cow pats, hoof marks and ruts into a luscious baize. When match-day came it soon became apparent his dream of an immaculate playing surface hadn\u2019t materialised, despite the many backbreaking hours he spent pushing the roller. Ankle ligaments were inevitably damaged, knees sorely tested and the football on display would have made Big Sam blush. A memorable time was had by all, but imagine our collective surprise when upon leaving the makeshift pitch we realised that my best man had failed to register that his field was next door to a public pitch, freely available and immaculately tended. Lovely chap, not very observant though, bless him\u201d \u2013 Jonathan Palmer.</p> <p>Send your letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@theguardian.com\">the.boss@theguardian.com</a>.

      "bodyText": "DON\u2019T JUDGE US Liverpool v Newcastle: Unbeaten over two league games in which they beat Tottenham at White Hart Lane before inconsiderately helping to drum Javi Gracia out of a job by not losing against Watford at home, Newcastle will attempt to become the first visiting team to win a top-flight game at Anfield since April 2017. Look out for them not becoming the first visiting team to win a top-flight game at Anfield since April 2017. Manchester United v Leicester City: Without a number of key players for a match many expect them to lose, even before Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw, among others, were ruled out through knack, look out for the first murmurings of anti-Solskj\u00e6r dissent from the Old Trafford stands, as Lord Ferg purses his lips and gives a barely perceptible shake of the head in response to Jamie Vardy standing, both ears cupped in front of the Stretford End after scoring his hat-trick. Sheffield United v Southampton: The Fiver will be looking out for Blades fans complaining about highlights of this particular game getting bottom-billing on Match of the Day due in no small part to London media bias against teams that use over-lapping centre-halves. Brighton v Burnley: Two sides whose results so far this season have mirrored each other go toe to toe. Look out for a draw, in the interests of symmetry. Wolves v Chelsea: There will be goals. Lots of goals. Tottenham v Crystal Palace: Look out for tedious post-match Social Media Disgrace Twitter bickering between rival sets of fans about which team\u2019s serial divers\u2019 dives were more obvious dives. Norwich City v Manchester City: Look out for the thinly disguised smirk playing on Pep Guardiola\u2019s lips as he patronises Norwich to within an inch of their life for adhering to their principles, even if it did result in an heroic 13-2 defeat for Daniel Farke\u2019s side. Bournemouth v Everton: The first instalment of a \u201cSuper Sunday\u201d bill also featuring Watford\u2019s match against Arsenal, watch out for assorted Sky Sports presenters and pitchside reporters sailing perilously close to the wind when it comes to flagrant breaches of the 1968 Trade Descriptions Act. Watford v Arsenal: Following Arsenal\u2019s routine win, look out for Watford\u2019s statement announcing the dismissal of Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores and reinstatement of Gracia to be sneaked out while everyone\u2019s attention is focused on the closing stages of the final Ashes Test. Aston Villa v West Ham: Scheduled for Monday, this game technically isn\u2019t being played at the weekend. The Fiver invites you to spend Monday morning focusing on how wrong we got our previous nine forecasts before belittling us for our lack of prescience in Monday\u2019s letters, then taking the rest of the day off. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe didn\u2019t get congratulated by the owner after winning the cup. When I went to Singapore to see him on 19 July, he congratulated me for qualifying for [Big Cup] and not for the Copa del Rey victory. I\u2019m sure you can understand my surprise. I\u2019m absolutely certain that the smoking gun of this situation was the Copa. During the season we got messages from above and other people that we should just leave the Copa. The fans wanted us to go for the cup, so did the players. They wanted to fight for the cup and had the conviction to win it. The coaching team, too. Winning it was definitely the detonator for this situation. Who\u2019d have thought it?\u201d \u2013 in what sounds a bit like Father\u2019s Ted\u2019s Golden Cleric awards speech, minus the liars bit, Marcelino gives his former employer at Valencia, Peter Lim, a bit of a verbal roistering. FIVER LETTERS \u201cFew of us living in the Bahamas post-Dorian will have much sympathy for the Napoli players who will have to change, by jings, in a unfinished changing room (yesterday\u2019s Fiver). Carlo Ancelotti says there are \u2018no words\u2019. But there are. Spoiled brats who have been paid too much for too long to retain any sense of normal context are the words. Oh, and Carlo, the next time a builder asks you, with one eyebrow raised, how much you really want the construction finished, do remember he is not asking for a completion date. Hope this helps\u201d \u2013 Charles Tuchel. \u201cRe: terrible pitches (Fiver passim). In the 1980s we played at one in Kawerau, New Zealand, on land that had been recently used as the rubbish tip, before a few tonnes of soil and a bit of grass seed was applied and the place repurposed as a \u2018stadium\u2019. Prior to kick-off, both teams had to walk the pitch in a line, picking up any bits of bottles, scrap iron or old cars that might have worked up to the surface. Worryingly we were also asked, in all seriousness, whether we had had recent tetanus shots\u201d \u2013 Rod de Lisle. \u201cIn 2011 I got married. When asked by my atypically considerate best man what I wanted to do on my stag do, I said I wanted nothing more than a game of football followed by an evening in a decent pub. Having opted to host the festivities in rural Somerset my best man, for reasons I never fully grasped, dutifully spent the evenings of several weeks going to a relative\u2019s field usually reserved for grazing dairy cows, with a heavy roller so as to transform the field of summer baked cow pats, hoof marks and ruts into a luscious baize. When match-day came it soon became apparent his dream of an immaculate playing surface hadn\u2019t materialised, despite the many backbreaking hours he spent pushing the roller. Ankle ligaments were inevitably damaged, knees sorely tested and the football on display would have made Big Sam blush. A memorable time was had by all, but imagine our collective surprise when upon leaving the makeshift pitch we realised that my best man had failed to register that his field was next door to a public pitch, freely available and immaculately tended. Lovely chap, not very observant though, bless him\u201d \u2013 Jonathan Palmer. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Charles Tuchel. BITS AND BOBS Arsenal and Manchester City are up and running in Women\u2019s Big Cup with big last-32, first-leg away wins. Kuwait haven\u2019t got any more love for coach Romeo Jozak, giving him the boot after their flamin\u2019 3-0 home defeat to Australia in World Cup qualifying. Manchester City could be without Aymeric Laporte until March due to knee-knack. Alisson\u2019s calf-ouch is keeping him on the Liverpool sidelines. Newcastle midfielder Sean Longstaff will miss Saturday\u2019s trip to Liverpool with ankle-gah. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those awful ones,\u201d sighed Bernard Cribbins. \u201cHe goes to stop a cross and gets his ankle caught. It\u2019s one of those freak ones.\u201d And biting an opponent during the Sherpa Van Trophy defeat to West Ham has cost Newport County defender Ryan Inniss a five-game stay on the naughty step. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Football Weekly Extra is right here. STILL WANT MORE? Is Big Ole\u2019s coaching sophisticated enough for Manchester United? Jamie Jackson investigates. The 10 things. Eni Aluko calls on players to get their legal beagles on the case to help rid the game of online abuse \u2013 and closing stadiums if racist chanting persists. Culture corner: Tim Parks runs the rule over Tobias Jones\u2019s new book Ultra, on the links between Italian football and the far right.

No longer the loner at the party, I submit to an afternoon of artistic enlightenment. There is intoxication on encountering Xiuching Tsay\u2019s hypnotic painting of three nude women bathed in endless circles and fluorescent colours. There is revelation when Louis Blue Newby points to the pervasive heteronormative narratives in film-making by reconstructing Crash. Later, sadness pours out of Roei Greenberg\u2019s silent, still image of a man-made forest in Israel, planted to erase the conquered Arab village of Ayn al-Zaytun that once stood there. The full range of emotions ends with laughter at Eliot Lord\u2019s Boris Can\u2019t Get Clean, a cartoonish painting of the prime minister with his head stuck in a washing machine that was \u201cmade in the EU\u201d. It\u2019s about as ridiculous as the political climate. Bloomberg New Contemporaries is at Leeds Art Gallery, 14 September to 17 November",

      "bodyText": "Campaigning ends on Friday in Tunisia\u2019s presidential election before Sunday\u2019s first round of voting, pitting more than two dozen candidates against each other, including a media mogul running for office from jail. Tunisia is the last of the Arab spring countries still on a democratic track, after Egypt slipped back toward authoritarianism and Syria and Libya descended into conflict. The jailed Nabil Karoui, one of the leading candidates, started a hunger strike this week. He is owner of the unlicensed Nessma TV channel, which he has used to promote his political ambitions. He was detained in August on suspicion of tax evasion and money laundering, charges that his supporters say are politically motivated. His detention is a wild card in the long-running struggle for political supremacy in the young democracy, which has pitted the moderate Islamist Ennahda party against the increasingly splintered anti-Islamist opposition. Karoui\u2019s appeal has been pitched against a sense of growing disillusionment with the country\u2019s main political leaders, who have failed to improve the lives of ordinary citizens since the country launched the Arab spring in 2011 by toppling of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. Karoui is sometimes depicted as Tunisia\u2019s equivalent of Silvio Berlusconi. In reality, however, he is more like the wealthy paterfamilias in a Middle Eastern soap opera, a man touched by both tragedy and success \u2013 an image he has skilfully communicated to a key impoverished section of Tunisian society that has until now been detached from the main political trends. He has used his TV channel to air images of himself delivering aid from a family charity to the poor, a slick and sometimes populist figure in comparison with his rivals. The wealthy secular political elite, which he once backed, now see him as a threat, while some on the Islamist side have still not forgiven him for screening Marjane Satrapi\u2019s Franco-Iranian film Persepolis in 2011.

Observers suggest the campaign is so close between the frontrunners that a fraction of a percentage point could decide who goes through to the runoff. Although the role of president is supposed to be less important than the parliament and prime minister, Essebsi tried to accrue more power and status, presenting himself as a modern incarnation of the country\u2019s founding father, Habib Bourguiba, down to wearing the same style of glasses. Tunisia\u2019s economy, not least its key tourism sector, has struggled since terrorist attacks in 2015 on two tourist sites, the resort of Sousse and the Bardo museum, in which 60 people were killed.

      "bodyText": "A teenager who was obsessed with mass shootings has been jailed for 16 years after ordering a firearm and ammunition on the dark web. Kyle Davies, 19, regarded those behind the massacre at Columbine high school and the Norwegian extremist Anders Breivik as his heroes. He used the cryptocurrency bitcoin to purchase a Glock 17 handgun and five rounds of ammunition from a gun dealer on the dark web, ordering it for delivery to his family home in Gloucester. US homeland security officers intercepted the order at Newark airport in New York and tipped off Davies\u2019 local police, who arrested him after delivering a dummy package to his home in July 2018. Davies insisted he had purchased the gun and ammunition in order to kill himself and denied he was planning a mass shooting. When officers searched his bedroom they discovered handwritten notes and a USB stick containing more than 1,000 pages relating to explosives and massacres. Sentencing him at Taunton crown court, the judge Paul Cook said: \u201cYou had attempted to obtain the equipment and had the intention to endanger life in a shooting event at some point in the future.\u201d Cook said officers searched Davies\u2019s home after his arrest on 20 June last year and found \u201cdisturbing and chilling\u201d research into mass murders. \u201cYour interest was correctly described as an obsession,\u201d he told Davies.

Why, ask those first (male) detectives, would Adler keep changing her story unless it had all been an invention? Does she understand the gravity of false reporting? The repetition of such scenes emphasises the administrative nightmare of the situation, while a parallel event in the second episode \u2013 another girl, a college student, claims to have been attacked in similar circumstances \u2013 shows how Adler\u2019s class and background affect her treatment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ba92755ba2e0915d93ffdde975a668d132b1ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ba92755ba2e0915d93ffdde975a668d132b1ecc/0_65_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unbelievable.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Panicked narrator \u2026 Kaitlyn Dever as Marie Adler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beth Dubber/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere the series does well to temper swift flashback scenes of Adler\u2019s alleged attack with a fleshed-out portrayal of somebody in crisis. There\u2019s a True Detective feel to the scenes between Wever and Collette, as they try to piece together something they can\u2019t quite make sense of. Like Adler\u2019s recollections, their own lines of inquiry are fuzzy. But unlike Adler, they have social status on their side. There\u2019s an inherent feminism in watching these two women fight for other women, even if the \u201cnot just a mother\u201d trope is sometimes hammered home a little too heavily: in one scene, while her husband prepares dinner and her children potter around, Duvall continues to telephone neighbouring police departments cut off from the domesticity around her.</p> <p>Unbelievable isn\u2019t a programme about whether Adler was telling the truth. It\u2019s about who gets to have their story heard, who is allowed to be believed. It\u2019s about the power dynamics that underpin the criminal justice system and society at large. \u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d, Adler asks the police who take her first statements. The answer for her, and so many others like her, is a resounding yes.</p>",

Why, ask those first (male) detectives, would Adler keep changing her story unless it had all been an invention? Does she understand the gravity of false reporting? The repetition of such scenes emphasises the administrative nightmare of the situation, while a parallel event in the second episode \u2013 another girl, a college student, claims to have been attacked in similar circumstances \u2013 shows how Adler\u2019s class and background affect her treatment. Elsewhere the series does well to temper swift flashback scenes of Adler\u2019s alleged attack with a fleshed-out portrayal of somebody in crisis. There\u2019s a True Detective feel to the scenes between Wever and Collette, as they try to piece together something they can\u2019t quite make sense of. Like Adler\u2019s recollections, their own lines of inquiry are fuzzy. But unlike Adler, they have social status on their side. There\u2019s an inherent feminism in watching these two women fight for other women, even if the \u201cnot just a mother\u201d trope is sometimes hammered home a little too heavily: in one scene, while her husband prepares dinner and her children potter around, Duvall continues to telephone neighbouring police departments cut off from the domesticity around her. Unbelievable isn\u2019t a programme about whether Adler was telling the truth. It\u2019s about who gets to have their story heard, who is allowed to be believed. It\u2019s about the power dynamics that underpin the criminal justice system and society at large. \u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d, Adler asks the police who take her first statements. The answer for her, and so many others like her, is a resounding yes.",

The fall in pre-tax profits was largely due to wage inflation, higher spending on pub repairs and maintenance, and increased debt interest costs.

Martin said the company had been surprised by an increase in the amount that customers spent on fruit machines this year, up from \u00a342m to \u00a346m, after a period of sustained decline. He said this might be down to government curbs on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which took effect in April and may have resulted in gamblers using his fruit machines instead.

      "bodyText": "My partner and I have a five-year-old son, who seems to be happy and thriving. We live far away from any other family members. I am estranged from my family (my parents divorced when I was young and neither was a very interested parent). We\u2019ve had various ensuing issues, therefore he has never known them. My grandfather died when I was 14. I was very close to him and missed him a lot. Around that time I started experiencing anxiety and sadness. I have mentioned my grandfather a few times to my son, nothing in too much detail. But periodically he becomes very upset, sobbing because he \u201cmisses Grampy\u201d. I find it worrying as his tears are real, as if he is experiencing loss or loneliness. I was quite lonely as a child and I\u2019m desperately trying not to project my loneliness on to him.

It now has almost two million total subscribers across its YouTube network, which includes The Guardian (1,000,000), Guardian News (527,000), Guardian Football (134,000) and Owen Jones talks (129,000).</p> <p>The publisher has been building its video audience over the last two years, and specifically on YouTube this has resulted in doubling its video views and an increase of more than 160% in subscriber growth.</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s success on the platform has been driven by a mixture of video formats such as documentaries, explainers and news features - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL40hxp8Iqg\">Anywhere but Westminster</a> (1.4m views) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnGjQKdJrPU\">The Trap documentary</a> (5.97m views) performed well, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgTwa3CPrIE\">Beyond Bionics</a> (2.36m views) and explainers like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLrzMzD_yvw\">Is Brexit definitely going to happen?</a> (428k views) also contributed.</p> <p>The publisher\u2019s original series, Modern Masculinity, attracted a younger demographic and achieved some of the highest engagement on the channel, with a total of 1.36m views, 7.25m minutes watched, 66k likes, 10.7k shares and 8k comments. The reaction to the episodes has been positive, with the YouTube community describing the series as \u2018<em>inquisitive, open and respectful</em>\u2019 and \u2018<em>honest and objective journalism</em>\u2019.</p> <p><strong>Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, Guardian News &amp; Media, said:</strong></p> <p>\u201c<em>To reach 1 million subscribers on YouTube is a huge achievement.

It now has almost two million total subscribers across its YouTube network, which includes The Guardian (1,000,000), Guardian News (527,000), Guardian Football (134,000) and Owen Jones talks (129,000). The publisher has been building its video audience over the last two years, and specifically on YouTube this has resulted in doubling its video views and an increase of more than 160% in subscriber growth. The Guardian\u2019s success on the platform has been driven by a mixture of video formats such as documentaries, explainers and news features - Anywhere but Westminster (1.4m views) The Trap documentary (5.97m views) performed well, while Beyond Bionics (2.36m views) and explainers like Is Brexit definitely going to happen? (428k views) also contributed. The publisher\u2019s original series, Modern Masculinity, attracted a younger demographic and achieved some of the highest engagement on the channel, with a total of 1.36m views, 7.25m minutes watched, 66k likes, 10.7k shares and 8k comments. The reaction to the episodes has been positive, with the YouTube community describing the series as \u2018inquisitive, open and respectful\u2019 and \u2018honest and objective journalism\u2019. Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, Guardian News &amp; Media, said: \u201cTo reach 1 million subscribers on YouTube is a huge achievement. This is testament to our long-term investment in groundbreaking video journalism which provides a positive, trusted voice on the biggest video search engine in the world.\u201d Christian Bennett, executive editor, visual journalism, said: \u201cWe are building a large engaged community around our video journalism and YouTube is enabling us to reach new readers \u2013 over half of our audience on the platform is under 34. \u201cFrom the Modern Masculinity series, which focuses on the issues faced by men and boys across the UK, to the award-winning Anywhere but Westminster and our video explainers, we provide our viewers with a broad range of trusted perspectives.\u201d The Guardian has also seen success in documentary formats - in March this year the Guardian-commissioned documentary, Black Sheep, was nominated for an Oscar in the Documentary Short Subject category. Another Guardian-commissioned documentary, Skip Day, won the prestigious Illy best short film award at the Quinzaine Des Realisateurs section of the Cannes film festival last year.",

No 13 Baby, Bone Machine, River Euphrates, songs that are 30 years old but haven\u2019t dated at all, and that Pixies, to their immense credit, still play with thrilling rawness and vitality. The stuff from Beneath the Eyrie, meanwhile, grapples with the issue all the band\u2019s recent material has faced \u2013 how should a mature version of Pixies sound? Variously trying on country rock, gauzy guitar textures (Daniel Boone) and even Brecht and Weil oompah (This Is My Fate) for size. Death Horizon is a fantastic song in classic Pixies mode. Who knows, maybe one day the audience will go as nuts for it as they do for the closing Vamos, tonight enlivened by Joey Santiago playing his guitar with his cap.",

      "bodyText": "The French judge who convicted Geoffrey Boycott of assaulting his girlfriend has criticised the former England cricketer after he was knighted and says she stands by her decision to find him guilty. The move to award Boycott the honour prompted outrage this week from a domestic violence charity. He was convicted in 1998 of assaulting Margaret Moore, who was left with black eyes after he hit her 20 times. Boycott, who has always denied the offence, said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t give a toss\u201d about criticism over Theresa May awarding him a knighthood, and cast doubt on the credibility of French justice. But after being tracked down by the Guardian in Alsace, Dominique Haumant, who presided over trial, said she did not believe Boycott\u2019s denial and that his conduct during the court case had been \u201carrogant\u201d and \u201cdeplorable\u201d. \u201cI cannot believe he\u2019s being received by the Queen,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m told she will take a sword and anoint him on each shoulder.

      "bodyText": "It is the fruit of three years\u2019 work, at least some of which is presumed to have taken place inside a \u00a325,000 shepherd\u2019s hut. The much-anticipated publication next week of For the Record, David Cameron\u2019s 752-page book promising a candid account of his time in politics, is expected to be the moment a man widely blamed for Britain\u2019s greatest postwar crisis will make a concerted bid for control of his tainted legacy. The stakes are high for everyone involved. \u201cA car crash\u201d was the view of a senior publisher at a rival to HarperCollins, which purchased the rights for a reported \u00a3800,000 in what it described in October 2016 as a \u201chotly contested\u201d deal. Despite his referendum defeat, Cameron\u2019s stock then remained relatively high, even if the figure paled in comparison to the reported \u00a34.6m received by Tony Blair for his book which was donated to the Royal British Legion. With the UK mired in Brexit-related culture wars and teetering on the edge of a potential no-deal departure from the EU in six weeks\u2019 time, the same industry figure suggested the timing of the book\u2019s release could not be worse, viewing the publication as an ordeal that HarperCollins would need to \u201cget over and done with\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sure the events will be hard to manage in that he\u2019ll be heckled, it\u2019ll be very hard for him to get through the Brexit part of the discussions. It\u2019ll just be a massive struggle,\u201d he said. Signs of trouble are already there. Some independent bookshops say they will not be stocking the \u00a325 hardback, often out of deference to left-leaning or remain-backing customers. In the eyes of many, the chaos of the last three years will forever be linked to the hubris of the Etonian former Tory leader. \u201cWe will probably get one or two people asking for it but I\u2019m not going to make a big thing \u2013 we might get firebombed,\u201d said Jane Howe, the owner of the Broadway Bookshop in Hackney.

As for style, one might expect For the Record to fall somewhere between the density of Brown\u2019s book and the breeziness of Blair\u2019s, which curled toes with one particularly purple passage of a sexual nature. Reportedly based on 53 hours of recordings from monthly meetings Cameron held with the Times columnist and Conservative peer Daniel Finkelstein, it was originally slated for the publication last year but publishers are said to have demanded a 100,000-word cut. A more optimistic vision of how it will fare was offered by James Daunt, the Waterstones chief executive, who said the chain was hoping it might fill an \u201cObama-shaped\u201d hole in its political biography section. \u201cOur early indications are that it is going to be extremely popular.

      "body": "<p>Far be it for us to stand in the way of young love, but there is something about the romance between new-gen pop stars Shawn Mendes (got big on Vine, does modelling on the side) and Camila Cabello (used to be in a girl group, Havana ooh nah-nah) that has made fans question its legitimacy. Not because they doubt the chance that these two thoroughly attractive people could find happiness in each other\u2019s toned arms, but because the long-term collaborators \u2013 they released their first joint single I Know What You Did Last Summer back in 2015 \u2013 decided to do couple-y things in public at roughly the same time they released another collab, the UK and US No 1 single Se\u00f1orita.</p> <p>It all whiffs a touch of last year\u2019s pop hook-up between Noah \u201csister of Miley\u201d Cyrus and SoundCloud rapper Lil Xan, which Xan now insists was set up by their record label Columbia to promote their uninspiring joint single Live Or Die (although Cyrus has since denied this). If all of Shawn and Camila\u2019s gyrating while performing at last week\u2019s MTV VMAs is just to make people fall even harder for them, then props to them. Rumoured PR-d relationships have forever been a mainstay of Top 40 supremacy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkh8UtuejGw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pkh8UtuejGw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>These relationships are never usually spun out for longer than a couple of months, tops. For example, Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston\u2019s romance was immediately raised as suspicious, with the leggy blonds\u2019 brief 2016 coupling called out as a \u201cfauxmance\u201d, \u201chelped\u201d by Hiddleston\u2019s I &lt;3 TS shirt and some extremely staged pics of them snogging on a big rock. Rumours also persist that Tay\u2019s hook-up with a young Harry Styles was set up as planned fodder for her hugely successful break-up album 1989. Who can say?</p> <p>The 17-year age gap wasn\u2019t the most suspicious thing about Drake and Jennifer Lopez\u2019s short-lived pairing; it was the overly snuggly Instagram posts and all the chat about the song they were working on together. The song, granted, never materialised, but I am quite happy to live in a world in which such a thing doesn\u2019t and never will exist.</p> <p>The biggest of all the reputed PR-stunt relationships in music, though, surely must be Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley\u2019s. The coming together of the Elvis clan and Jackson family back in 1994 was huge news. Handy that, considering Jacko\u2019s sales had started to slide and Presley was attempting to start her own music career. Jackson\u2019s former maid has also recently questioned the authenticity of the pair\u2019s marriage, saying it was arranged as a distraction from unsavoury allegations made by minors. Grim. And another reason to not get too fussed over the comparatively harmless union of Shawn and Camila who may (or may not!?) only be doing it for the streams.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Far be it for us to stand in the way of young love, but there is something about the romance between new-gen pop stars Shawn Mendes (got big on Vine, does modelling on the side) and Camila Cabello (used to be in a girl group, Havana ooh nah-nah) that has made fans question its legitimacy. Not because they doubt the chance that these two thoroughly attractive people could find happiness in each other\u2019s toned arms, but because the long-term collaborators \u2013 they released their first joint single I Know What You Did Last Summer back in 2015 \u2013 decided to do couple-y things in public at roughly the same time they released another collab, the UK and US No 1 single Se\u00f1orita. It all whiffs a touch of last year\u2019s pop hook-up between Noah \u201csister of Miley\u201d Cyrus and SoundCloud rapper Lil Xan, which Xan now insists was set up by their record label Columbia to promote their uninspiring joint single Live Or Die (although Cyrus has since denied this). If all of Shawn and Camila\u2019s gyrating while performing at last week\u2019s MTV VMAs is just to make people fall even harder for them, then props to them. Rumoured PR-d relationships have forever been a mainstay of Top 40 supremacy. These relationships are never usually spun out for longer than a couple of months, tops. For example, Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston\u2019s romance was immediately raised as suspicious, with the leggy blonds\u2019 brief 2016 coupling called out as a \u201cfauxmance\u201d, \u201chelped\u201d by Hiddleston\u2019s I &lt;3 TS shirt and some extremely staged pics of them snogging on a big rock. Rumours also persist that Tay\u2019s hook-up with a young Harry Styles was set up as planned fodder for her hugely successful break-up album 1989. Who can say? The 17-year age gap wasn\u2019t the most suspicious thing about Drake and Jennifer Lopez\u2019s short-lived pairing; it was the overly snuggly Instagram posts and all the chat about the song they were working on together. The song, granted, never materialised, but I am quite happy to live in a world in which such a thing doesn\u2019t and never will exist. The biggest of all the reputed PR-stunt relationships in music, though, surely must be Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley\u2019s. The coming together of the Elvis clan and Jackson family back in 1994 was huge news. Handy that, considering Jacko\u2019s sales had started to slide and Presley was attempting to start her own music career. Jackson\u2019s former maid has also recently questioned the authenticity of the pair\u2019s marriage, saying it was arranged as a distraction from unsavoury allegations made by minors. Grim. And another reason to not get too fussed over the comparatively harmless union of Shawn and Camila who may (or may not!?) only be doing it for the streams.",

Everywhere, friends and acquaintances are interested in the minutiae of your new routine, probing for stories to prove you are, actually, moving on, and for any anecdotes that may later make good gossip. People remark on whether you\u2019ve been going to the gym, or going out a lot, or did something new with your hair.

A Strong Woman Doing Well On Her Own. A woman (I\u2019m sorry) thriving. The logic was this: if I looked good I was doing well, in a way that anyone could see before I opened my mouth. I was tired of the gentle arm squeezes and soft-eyed how-you-holding-ups, of people checking in to make sure I was \u201ctaking care of myself\u201d. I figured that becoming inarguably, conventionally attractive would cut them off at the pass, giving them a narrative they understood (\u201cglow up\u201d is a universal language) and saving myself the trouble of figuring out what I actually felt. I was comforted by the cut-throat simplicity of it: to be hot was to be doing well. Better than before, better than him. Better than other, weaker people who are broken by something as small as grief. I didn\u2019t pause for a minute to consider how unhealthy it was to look on a breakup as a competition.

It was simply none of my business.</p> <p>And yet, after months of twice-weekly classes, the only victories I noticed were internal: the ability to ride longer at a higher resistance, a sense of ease during a push-ups portion of class that had once left me breathless. My body was a little firmer, maybe, but not visibly so. I wasn\u2019t ready to invest in a conch piercing or a fake tan or \u00a3100 cycling shorts.

The treatment of the Dutch colonial period in public spaces has become a matter for keenly contested debate in recent years with street names changed and questions raised about the relevance of statues celebrating military heroes of the past. When the Mauritshuis museum, which is home to a host of national treasures including Vermeer\u2019s Girl With a Pearl Earring, removed a bust of its namesake from the museum\u2019s foyer in 2018, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, cautioned against \u201cjudging the distant past through today\u2019s eyes\u201d.

According to a new global commission, advances in micro energy grids and renewable energy technologies could \u201cdramatically accelerate change\u201d and transform lives in rural areas of sub-Saharan African and south Asia. The Global Commission to End Energy Poverty met for the first time this week to set out plans to accelerate the UN\u2019s sustainable development goal to ensure access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for all people by 2030. The commission, established by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative and the Rockefeller Foundation, plans to bring together leading investors, utilities and policymakers to tackle energy poverty. Under the initiative, the distributed networks would help connect homes, businesses and schools to small-scale solar power projects to deliver cheap, sustainable electricity that can help power local economic growth. The commission includes government leaders, energy industry chief executives and representatives from major development organisations, including Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency. Dr Rajiv Shah, president of the Rockefeller Foundation and formerly of the US agency for international development, said \u201ca whole new way of thinking\u201d about energy distribution was required. \u201cWe cannot end poverty without successfully ending energy poverty,\u201d said Shah. \u201cFor 140 years we\u2019ve had this mindset that energy access means building big power plants and connecting them to grids, and that\u2019s how you provide electricity. \u201cToday, new technology frontiers, business models, and our knowledge of alternatives is so strong that this commission will be able to set out a new roadmap to end the energy access problem for 1 billion people across the globe.\u201d The commission also plans to help set up new regulation in developing countries to accelerate the rollout of new energy systems, and make the projects more attractive to international investors. \u201cIf I want to start a small solar-powered mini-grid programme in a rural part of an under-served country, I could be prevented from actually providing power without permission from the state-owned utility which might own that business opportunity,\u201d Shah explained. \u201cThat\u2019s one of many policy roadblocks that is preventing distributed solutions from really being easy to invest in.\u201d Shah will co-chair the commission alongside Dr Ernest Moniz, a former US energy secretary,and Dr Akinwumi Adesina, the president of the African Development Bank. Moniz warned that existing plans to end global energy poverty by 2030 are \u201cnot fast enough\u201d and should be more ambitious. \u201cTwenty years ago, energy access might have been defined by having a 20-watt lightbulb. One doesn\u2019t want to denigrate that \u2013 the shift from having no light to some light is major \u2013 but our ambition is more than that. We want energy access that allows for credible family, community and regional economic development. Frankly, we\u2019d like it to allow for entrepreneurial activity too,\u201d he said. Moniz said that by relying on renewable energy, particularly solar power alongside batteries, developing nations should be able to attract investment in clean energy and rule out the need for future investments in coal-fired power plants. Adopting such methods could also halt the wood-burning that has led to mass deforestation in some countries, he said. \u201cSpeaking personally, there is a lot of concern about a new round of investments in coal funded by Chinese development banks. There could be a lock-in of emissions for the future. We would rather see distributed [energy grid] architecture, including renewables, and potentially with a role for gas,\u201d he said. Shah added that economic development and the empowerment of women offered the best chance for a low-emissions future. \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman in rural Bihar and you\u2019re able to all of a sudden access electricity, get a sewing machine, create an income, provide light for your daughter to study at night, it\u2019s just transformational,\u201d said Shah. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the same thing in India and Myanmar and throughout Africa. This commission embarks upon this task with a huge amount of optimism and a real understanding of how important it is in the lives of so many people around the world.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On Monday, only hours before the drama of parliament\u2019s prorogation, John Bercow announced he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/john-bercow-to-step-down-as-speaker-by-31-october\" title=\"\">retire as Speaker</a> before the next election. Downing Street had declared war on him in the Sunday papers, briefing that it would break convention and seek his removal from his seat at the next election. Instead, Bercow has sought to undercut the government by giving the current parliament, habituated to autonomy and rebellion against the whips, a vote on his successor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bercow\u2019s \u2018constitutional vandalism\u2019 is unlikely to trouble any government with a majority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>An erstwhile member of the Tory hard right \u2013 in the 1980s he chaired the Federation of Conservative Students, which was notorious for its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/06/conservative-party-uncomfortable-nelson-mandela\" title=\"\">\u201cHang Nelson Mandela\u201d literature</a> \u2013 his political journey has seen him end up an improbable poster boy for dewy-eyed liberals. Even more surprisingly, his glowering manner, gravel-voiced barking and theatrical chiding of MPs have made him an internet meme. He has presided over significant, and in some parts deeply resented, changes to parliament\u2019s functioning; the contest to replace him will be the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/next-speaker-house-of-commons-who-are-the-candidates\" title=\"\">highly politicised and bitterly fought in living memory</a>, with MPs aware that in a deadlocked Commons the Speaker\u2019s powers are profound.</p> <p>When elected, a new Speaker lays claim to \u201c<a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/ldctso54.htm\" title=\"\">ancient and undoubted rights and privileges</a>\u201d of parliament, including \u201cfreedom of speech in debate, freedom from arrest\u201d. Defence of those rights has been the Speaker\u2019s watchword since the tenure of William Lenthall in the 17th century. In one of the most dramatic episodes of England\u2019s descent into civil war, Lenthall had refused, to the king\u2019s face, to identify five MPs Charles I sought to arrest. The moment has entered British civic myth as the first clear assertion of the Speaker\u2019s loyalty to parliament rather than to an overmighty executive power; it is painted in fresco in Westminster.</p> <p>Lenthall\u2019s lessons for modern Speakers aren\u2019t confined to the doughty defence of parliamentary rights. His defiance was a finely tuned balancing act: courage hedged with deference to an irascible monarch. Fraught management of contending political forces made him a target of a newly free press, which gossiped of his avarice and pilloried him as a secret royalist. Bercow might recognise that.</p> <p>The Speakership is an odd institution. Its long evolution since Lenthall\u2019s day has imbued it with considerable power: to shape the debate in parliament, select amendments and interpret parliament\u2019s rules. That power comes at the cost of scrupulous political neutrality, a principle that emerged in the 18th century and which has been observed as ironclad for at least the past 100 years. In the US House of Representatives the role is highly partisan; in France and in Germany the speaker maintains an active involvement in party politics. The UK\u2019s Speaker resigns from their party and usually stands for re-election unopposed by major parties; Baroness Boothroyd, Bercow\u2019s only living predecessor, observed that a new Speaker is frequently harder on their former ideological confreres, in an attempt to achieve impartiality. Bercow\u2019s enemies in parliament \u2013 the current government and its predecessor, as well as the no-deal hardcore of the European Research Group (ERG) \u2013 charge him with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/17/tory-mp-launches-attempt-to-oust-john-bercow-as-speaker\" title=\"\">shattering this impartiality</a> during the long Brexit impasse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2019/sep/12/operation-yellowhammer-and-parliament-prorogued-politics-weekly-podcast\">Operation Yellowhammer and parliament prorogued - Politics Weekly podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bercow had to change things. His election, in 2009, came after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/19/speaker-michael-martin-to-resign\" title=\"\">resignation of Michael Martin</a>, in the midst of the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal. Bercow billed himself as a moderniser and \u201cbackbencher\u2019s friend\u201d \u2013 his drift towards social liberalism had left him out of favour with Tory leaders, and was disfavoured by the whips. A memo circulated to all candidates by the then clerk of legislation, Robert Rogers (now Lord Lisvane), laid out a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/jun/19/commons-reform-plan-speaker\" title=\"\">75-point menu for reform</a> of the Commons; it was beyond the Speaker\u2019s scope alone to implement much of it, but it certainly inspired Bercow\u2019s expansive granting of urgent questions \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/harriet-harman-vows-to-be-scrupulously-neutral-if-elected-as-speaker\" title=\"\">152 in the last year</a>, as opposed to just two in the year before his accession \u2013 allowing MPs to haul ministers to account in the Commons. Any Speaker elected in 2009 would have necessarily been a reformer: the impetus to reform came from the political establishment itself, aware that Westminster had reached a new nadir in public esteem.</p> <p>Until this parliament, it was Bercow\u2019s personality rather than his relatively modest procedural innovations that was the focus of ire. His aggressive, occasionally vaudevillian style in the chair, and his willingness to chastise ministers, led to an abortive plot to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/26/tory-backbench-rebellion-defeats-hagues-attempt-to-unseat-speaker-john-bercow\" title=\"\">oust him in 2015</a>. More seriously, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/03/john-bercow-further-bullying-claims-emerge-against-house-of-commons-speaker\" title=\"\">allegations of bullying</a> have overshadowed his office in recent years, and perhaps as a consequence he has been ineffective in acting to stem the bullying and harassment endemic in Westminster. Accusations of partiality, some rather confected, long smouldered on the Tory benches \u2013 but it is his handling of Brexit procedure that whipped them into conflagration.</p> <p>Bercow\u2019s accusers claim he has ripped up parliament\u2019s rulebook to suit his own political preferences (in 2017 he unwisely disclosed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/12/john-bercow-speaker-voted-remain-brexit-referendum\" title=\"\">his own vote for remain</a>). Not only has he allowed MPs to seize control of proceedings from the government, but colluded with them by widening the scope of emergency debates to allow parliamentary insurrections. The latter is inescapably a constitutional innovation. Bercow doesn\u2019t shy away from the charge of novelty: for him, the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life \u2013 he insists on parliament\u2019s right to express its will, and on defending that right in the face of an executive determined to marginalise it. Nor is he finished yet: in last night\u2019s Bingham lecture, he vowed further \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/12/bercow-warns-pm-not-to-defy-law-on-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">procedural creativity</a>\u201d should Boris Johnson prove determined to ignore the law.</p> <p>The orgy of suspicion and paranoia that followed the Brexit referendum has touched many putatively impartial institutions: both press and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/12/brexit-kwasi-kwarteng-criticised-for-biased-judges-comment\" title=\"\">judiciary</a> are regularly accused of barely veiled remainer bias, but nowhere has been more assailed than parliament itself. It is a symptom of a deeper malaise, in which the reserves of civic trust necessary for political representation have evaporated.</p> <p>The Speaker\u2019s rulings are a consequence, not a cause, of the political impasse \u2013 the unavoidable effect of a conflict between legislature and executive eagerly pursued by successive governments. Small majorities or minority governments \u2013 as much the result of a democratic process as the referendum \u2013 find their rebels empowered; if any such government treats parliament as a truculent inconvenience, it will find MPs ready to humble it. Bercow\u2019s instinct to empower parliament is real and consistent \u2013 though he delights in making enemies \u2013 but his \u201cconstitutional vandalism\u201d is unlikely to trouble any government with a majority.

      "bodyText": "On Monday, only hours before the drama of parliament\u2019s prorogation, John Bercow announced he would retire as Speaker before the next election. Downing Street had declared war on him in the Sunday papers, briefing that it would break convention and seek his removal from his seat at the next election. Instead, Bercow has sought to undercut the government by giving the current parliament, habituated to autonomy and rebellion against the whips, a vote on his successor. An erstwhile member of the Tory hard right \u2013 in the 1980s he chaired the Federation of Conservative Students, which was notorious for its \u201cHang Nelson Mandela\u201d literature \u2013 his political journey has seen him end up an improbable poster boy for dewy-eyed liberals. Even more surprisingly, his glowering manner, gravel-voiced barking and theatrical chiding of MPs have made him an internet meme. He has presided over significant, and in some parts deeply resented, changes to parliament\u2019s functioning; the contest to replace him will be the most highly politicised and bitterly fought in living memory, with MPs aware that in a deadlocked Commons the Speaker\u2019s powers are profound. When elected, a new Speaker lays claim to \u201cancient and undoubted rights and privileges\u201d of parliament, including \u201cfreedom of speech in debate, freedom from arrest\u201d. Defence of those rights has been the Speaker\u2019s watchword since the tenure of William Lenthall in the 17th century. In one of the most dramatic episodes of England\u2019s descent into civil war, Lenthall had refused, to the king\u2019s face, to identify five MPs Charles I sought to arrest. The moment has entered British civic myth as the first clear assertion of the Speaker\u2019s loyalty to parliament rather than to an overmighty executive power; it is painted in fresco in Westminster. Lenthall\u2019s lessons for modern Speakers aren\u2019t confined to the doughty defence of parliamentary rights. His defiance was a finely tuned balancing act: courage hedged with deference to an irascible monarch. Fraught management of contending political forces made him a target of a newly free press, which gossiped of his avarice and pilloried him as a secret royalist. Bercow might recognise that. The Speakership is an odd institution. Its long evolution since Lenthall\u2019s day has imbued it with considerable power: to shape the debate in parliament, select amendments and interpret parliament\u2019s rules. That power comes at the cost of scrupulous political neutrality, a principle that emerged in the 18th century and which has been observed as ironclad for at least the past 100 years. In the US House of Representatives the role is highly partisan; in France and in Germany the speaker maintains an active involvement in party politics. The UK\u2019s Speaker resigns from their party and usually stands for re-election unopposed by major parties; Baroness Boothroyd, Bercow\u2019s only living predecessor, observed that a new Speaker is frequently harder on their former ideological confreres, in an attempt to achieve impartiality. Bercow\u2019s enemies in parliament \u2013 the current government and its predecessor, as well as the no-deal hardcore of the European Research Group (ERG) \u2013 charge him with shattering this impartiality during the long Brexit impasse. Bercow had to change things. His election, in 2009, came after the resignation of Michael Martin, in the midst of the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal. Bercow billed himself as a moderniser and \u201cbackbencher\u2019s friend\u201d \u2013 his drift towards social liberalism had left him out of favour with Tory leaders, and was disfavoured by the whips. A memo circulated to all candidates by the then clerk of legislation, Robert Rogers (now Lord Lisvane), laid out a 75-point menu for reform of the Commons; it was beyond the Speaker\u2019s scope alone to implement much of it, but it certainly inspired Bercow\u2019s expansive granting of urgent questions \u2013 152 in the last year, as opposed to just two in the year before his accession \u2013 allowing MPs to haul ministers to account in the Commons. Any Speaker elected in 2009 would have necessarily been a reformer: the impetus to reform came from the political establishment itself, aware that Westminster had reached a new nadir in public esteem. Until this parliament, it was Bercow\u2019s personality rather than his relatively modest procedural innovations that was the focus of ire. His aggressive, occasionally vaudevillian style in the chair, and his willingness to chastise ministers, led to an abortive plot to oust him in 2015. More seriously, allegations of bullying have overshadowed his office in recent years, and perhaps as a consequence he has been ineffective in acting to stem the bullying and harassment endemic in Westminster. Accusations of partiality, some rather confected, long smouldered on the Tory benches \u2013 but it is his handling of Brexit procedure that whipped them into conflagration. Bercow\u2019s accusers claim he has ripped up parliament\u2019s rulebook to suit his own political preferences (in 2017 he unwisely disclosed his own vote for remain). Not only has he allowed MPs to seize control of proceedings from the government, but colluded with them by widening the scope of emergency debates to allow parliamentary insurrections. The latter is inescapably a constitutional innovation. Bercow doesn\u2019t shy away from the charge of novelty: for him, the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life \u2013 he insists on parliament\u2019s right to express its will, and on defending that right in the face of an executive determined to marginalise it. Nor is he finished yet: in last night\u2019s Bingham lecture, he vowed further \u201cprocedural creativity\u201d should Boris Johnson prove determined to ignore the law. The orgy of suspicion and paranoia that followed the Brexit referendum has touched many putatively impartial institutions: both press and judiciary are regularly accused of barely veiled remainer bias, but nowhere has been more assailed than parliament itself. It is a symptom of a deeper malaise, in which the reserves of civic trust necessary for political representation have evaporated. The Speaker\u2019s rulings are a consequence, not a cause, of the political impasse \u2013 the unavoidable effect of a conflict between legislature and executive eagerly pursued by successive governments. Small majorities or minority governments \u2013 as much the result of a democratic process as the referendum \u2013 find their rebels empowered; if any such government treats parliament as a truculent inconvenience, it will find MPs ready to humble it. Bercow\u2019s instinct to empower parliament is real and consistent \u2013 though he delights in making enemies \u2013 but his \u201cconstitutional vandalism\u201d is unlikely to trouble any government with a majority. Whatever the tabloids claim, this government\u2019s inability to win a vote is its fault, and its fault alone. The competition to replace Bercow is already under way. Some candidates, such as Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant, promise a return to procedural orthodoxy: umpire-like impartiality, slavish adherence to the rulebook. Yet it is hard to see how any candidate could avoid controversy in a restive, finely balanced parliament with an executive determined to test the limits of its power and a legislature impatient with abuse. Brexit has seen the withering of many parliamentary delusions: the strictures of convention, the stability of the parties, the reliability of the \u201cgood chap\u201d theory of office. Bercow\u2019s pugnacious defence of the legislature is a boon, but he must realise that reform conducted solely through the Speaker\u2019s chair also tests democratic legitimacy; such a realisation must be behind his embrace, in last night\u2019s lecture, of a more codified constitutional settlement. As the legal case over prorogation waits to be heard by the supreme court next week, and the looming Brexit deadline leaves the government scrambling for political safety, Bercow\u2019s final act remains yet to be played.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Bogut will likely be investigated for a foul-mouthed post-game spray while Boomers assistant coach Luc Longley was also fuming after the Europeans beat Australia 95-88 in a double overtime World Cup semi-final heartbreaker. Spain trailed by 11 against the Boomers in Beijing but, just like in the Rio Olympic bronze medal game three years ago, rallied and went ahead courtesy of a dubious foul \u2013 on Bogut \u2013 in the final seconds. Spain won that match by one but this time Patty Mills (34 points) had the chance to get one back for Australia when he went to line with four seconds on the clock down by one. But his second free-throw bobbled out and Ricky Rubio\u2019s long heave just missed to force overtime. Matthew Dellavedova\u2019s desperate floater on the buzzer clanged out to send teams into a second extra period, where Marc Gasol (33 points) and Rubio (19 points, seven rebounds, 12 assists) steered their side clear. A \u201cfurious\u201d Boomers team surged through the media mixed zone post-game, Bogut yelling \u201cGoogle where headquarters of fucking Fiba is ... it\u2019s a fucking disgrace\u201d. On court Bogut had earlier flashed a money signal with his hands after the foul that helped put Spain ahead, and he is likely to face investigation and a fine ahead of Sunday\u2019s bronze medal game against either France. His comments were curious, given Fiba headquarters are in Switzerland. Sunday will be Longley\u2019s fourth bronze medal game, having played in two and coached in one already, the most recent in eerily similar circumstances against the same opponent in Rio. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find an altar somewhere and burn a sacrifice to the basketball gods, because they\u2019re not kissing us on the dick yet, like they do Spain,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like Spain are kissed on the dick by the basketball gods every time we play them. \u201cIt\u2019s gut-wrenching for the guys; they\u2019ve been so fucking good, so consistent and played so hard and I felt like they deserved to win that and it doesn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s the right result.\u201d Australia did have their moments though, with Mills\u2019 free-throw somehow rimming out and 22 turnovers a constant olive branch to a Spain side that shot at just 31% in the second half. Dellavedova\u2019s attempted match-winner looked good too, before it bounced out and he was forced out of the second overtime period with cramps. Nick Kay was enormous for Australia off the bench, scoring 16 points and grabbing 11 boards as the Boomers grabbed a staggering 20 offensive rebounds. \u201cThey\u2019re furious, crushed. .. it\u2019s very quiet in there and it stings in lots of ways, not least of which is that\u2019s the team we lost to in Rio,\u201d Longley said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the time to start pointing fingers and spitting dummies; we\u2019ve got to reload.\u201d Argentina 80, France 66 Luis Scola was asked what Sunday will mean to him, and he didn\u2019t hesitate with the answer. \u201cEverything,\u201d he said.

He has failed to tackle antisemitism in his own party.\u201d Lib Dem numbers in the Commons have swelled in recent weeks as Chuka Umunna, who moved to the party shortly before Swinson became leader, was joined by fellow ex-Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Angela Smith, as well as the former Tories Phillip Lee and Sarah Wollaston and the byelection winner Jane Dodds. The new arrivals have caused internal tensions, with some Lib Dem activists complaining about \u201ccelebrity MP entryism\u201d after Umunna and Berger were lined up for winnable London seats. Swinson said an influx of MPs was \u201ca nice problem to have\u201d, but conceded it could result in some existing candidates being asked to stand down: \u201cThat has to be managed, but I\u2019ve been really impressed at how people have responded to that.\u201d The arrival of Lee, who abstained in the vote on equal marriage and argued that immigrants should show they do not have HIV or hepatitis B before being allowed into the UK, has caused a separate row, with the head of the Lib Dems\u2019 LGBT group quitting in protest. Swinson conceded the move had caused difficulties but argued this was mainly one of messaging, defending Lee for \u201ca very nuanced position\u201d, which, she said, had been misrepresented in parts of the media. \u201cObviously, I regret that some people have been upset by that. I think we can certainly learn some lessons about our internal processes, how we communicate.\u201d She stressed the party would not accept any MPs without question, saying would-be new entrants must undergo a 90-minute grilling from the Lib Dem chief whip, Alistair Carmichael, to \u201cmake sure they share our liberal values\u201d. Recent weeks have illustrated the paradox faced by Swinson ahead of a conference at which the Lib Dems will celebrate record membership of more than 120,000: while Brexit is the party\u2019s great foe, it is also arguably the prime reason for its surge. \u201cIf you gave me a choice I\u2019d put no Brexit above having a good opportunity for the Lib Dems, every day of the week,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is a huge opportunity, which is obviously exciting. I want to see a liberal society, and there\u2019s more possibility now that we might be able to achieve that. It does also feel like a very critical and perilous time for our country. The stakes are very high.\u201d",

The leftover flesh is then blitzed with a cup of water and squeezed again, which produces a thinner, but still substantial milk. Finally, it\u2019s squeezed a third time, for a much thinner, very watery milk.\u201d</p> <p>Coconuts don\u2019t grow on trees here in the UK, obviously, so the closest we can get to that thick first extraction is tinned cream, while tinned milk is more like the second pressing. Even so, as with anything canned, from baked beans to tuna, you get what you pay for. \u201cI only ever use Asian coconut milk,\u201d Gokani says, adding that he favours Thai brands because they have a very high fat content, which gives you the best of both worlds in a single can \u2013 \u201cOpen a tin without shaking it: the cream will have risen to the top above the more watery milk.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kay-plunkett-hogge\" title=\"\">Kay Plunkett-Hogge</a>, whose new <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/baan-9781911624059.html\" title=\"\">book Baan</a> (\u00a320, Pavilion) is a love letter to the food she grew up on in Bangkok, is another fan of Thai products \u2013 not that she\u2019s biased or anything. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to make your own,\u201d she says, \u201cbut tins are far less time-consuming.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s the difference between coconut milk, coconut cream (which both come in tins) and creamed coconut (which comes as a block)? There\u2019s also cream of coconut (which also comes in a tin) and coconut oil, but they\u2019re not as easily confused with the others. And then there\u2019s powdered coconut milk \u2026 Help! Elisabeth, Guildford, Surrey From yoghurt and cream to milk and water, you can\u2019t move for coconut these days. That\u2019s mostly down to its recent anointment in the west as some miracle vegan alternative to dairy, so you\u2019d imagine it would be in producers\u2019 interests not to bewilder us in this way, but there you go. Maybe Karan Gokani can help, seeing as he runs Hoppers in London, which majors in the food of Sri Lanka and south India, where barely a meal passes without coconut putting in an appearance somewhere. \u201cBack home in India and Sri Lanka, we usually make the cream and milk from scratch,\u201d he says. \u201cYou grate the dense flesh of older coconuts, tie the shavings in muslin and squeeze out the thick, rich cream. The leftover flesh is then blitzed with a cup of water and squeezed again, which produces a thinner, but still substantial milk. Finally, it\u2019s squeezed a third time, for a much thinner, very watery milk.\u201d Coconuts don\u2019t grow on trees here in the UK, obviously, so the closest we can get to that thick first extraction is tinned cream, while tinned milk is more like the second pressing. Even so, as with anything canned, from baked beans to tuna, you get what you pay for. \u201cI only ever use Asian coconut milk,\u201d Gokani says, adding that he favours Thai brands because they have a very high fat content, which gives you the best of both worlds in a single can \u2013 \u201cOpen a tin without shaking it: the cream will have risen to the top above the more watery milk.\u201d Kay Plunkett-Hogge, whose new book Baan (\u00a320, Pavilion) is a love letter to the food she grew up on in Bangkok, is another fan of Thai products \u2013 not that she\u2019s biased or anything. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to make your own,\u201d she says, \u201cbut tins are far less time-consuming. Look for a brand without added emulsifiers, though, or the cream won\u2019t behave in the same way.\u201d Many cheaper alternatives sold in supermarkets tend to be gloopy and are artificially thickened in this way, so read the small print on the label. From a cook\u2019s viewpoint, Gokani advises saving the denser cream to finish a sauce (or for desserts and garnishes), not only to minimise its chances of splitting, but also to avoid over-diluting that glorious, coconutty flavour.

Brilliance from Gasol and some shrewd tactical adjustments from coach Scariola the difference at the death as the World No 2 side ran over Australia in double overtime.</p> <p>Incredible effort and tenacity from a team that has won so many admirers en route to the semis. The Boomers had never previously won four straight games at a World Cup - this time they won six - and were a solitary free throw away from a seventh, and a guaranteed World Cup medal.

In one game it\u2019s the wily veteran Dellavedova, in another it\u2019s hot-hands Joe Ingles. The man-mountain Aron Baynes has been superb defensively (and not too shabby with the threes either), and his understudy Andrew Bogut saved his best for a ten-minute spell to blow open the Czechs in the quarters.

      "bodyText": "It was a narrative of redemption for a Boomers side at it\u2019s first ever World Cup semi-final - looking to become the first Asian men\u2019s side into a World Cup final, and looking to overcome the team that so narrowly denied them a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics. But as hard as Australia fought - they led for the vast majority of the game - the Spanish simply refused to let go. Brilliance from Gasol and some shrewd tactical adjustments from coach Scariola the difference at the death as the World No 2 side ran over Australia in double overtime. Incredible effort and tenacity from a team that has won so many admirers en route to the semis. The Boomers had never previously won four straight games at a World Cup - this time they won six - and were a solitary free throw away from a seventh, and a guaranteed World Cup medal. What a cruel game. They will pick themselves up for the consolation of a third-place play off. But it\u2019s Spain who march on - and will take on either France or Argentina (who play later tonight) in the gold-medal game. An absolute classic. An epic. A heartbreaker for Australia. That\u2019s World Cup basketball. I\u2019ve just had a look at the full-time (well, double over-time) stats: Marc. Gasol. He had something like four - all from the stripe, and none from open play at half time - he\u2019s finished with 33 points. Incredible. Patty Mills with a game-high 34 points, Nic Kay with 16 pts and 11 rebounds, Bogut with 12 pts and nine rebounds but not too much else offensively. For Spain it was the Gasol-show. It needed to be after Rubio went cold from 3pt range with 1/8. He still finished with 19, the Phoenix Suns star, while Llull came up with some high-pressure bombs to keep them close all game - he finished with 17 pts. I\u2019m not sure if I can even find the words at this stage to sum all of that up. Thankfully I don\u2019t have to - here\u2019s a match report from our very own Guardian sport desk: Can you believe that. The Boomers threw absolutely everything at that. And cast your mind back to regulation time when it was Patty Mills who had the chance from the stripe to win it with 4.7 seconds to go. Cruel on a player who has been sensational for Australia across this tournament - a potential tournament MVP but you\u2019d imagine that will go elsewhere now. Ay, ay, ay! What a tense and tumultuous game of basketball! When it mattered most it was the European powerhouses who stepped up a gear. Marc Gasol. What a player. And Australia\u2019s winning run is over - Spain go through to the gold-medal game of the 2019 Basketball World Cup! Second over-time 4 min: Spain 95-88 Australia Rubio misses two from the free throws - and the Mills pulls down a three! Surely not from here! We\u2019re back to five points. But who else? It\u2019s Marc Gasol - he lands two. He\u2019s been the difference. And the Spanish bench goes up once again! Second over-time 4 min: Spain 93-85 Australia Gasol blocks Goulding. What a contribution by this man - he had a quiet first half but he\u2019s been unequivocally best on court since then. What a player - what a big-time player. Second over-time 3 min: Spain 93-85 Australia Long faces on the Australian bench as Mills loses it at the dribble. 20+ turnovers but 19 offensive rebounds. It\u2019s been such a mixed night from Australia. Claver goes to the stripe. He lands the first, misses the second. But Baynes turns it over! Spain to play this out, run down the clock. Second over-time 3 min: Spain 92-85 Australia In theory there\u2019s enough time for Australia, but well.. Baynes looks for a three - and he\u2019s landed it!! Creek called for a foul on Rubio - what a let down after that 3! Rubio takes the first. And the second. Second over-time 3 min: Spain 90-82 Australia Oh my, oh my - Spain pull down another monster three - they\u2019re out by eight and they\u2019re celebrating in the stands the Spaniards!! Is this the ball game?? Lemanis calls a time out. Second over-time 2 min: Spain 87-82 Australia Gasol - from close range. Unstoppable! Great feed from Rubio. Their experienced heads have been getting it done. Goulding into the Australian five for more three-point heat, but he can\u2019t land one. Rubio settles it down. Goulding fires from three again but gets nothing near it! Second over-time 1 min: Spain 85-82 Australia Patty drives to the bucket - it misses, but Bogut tips in! Spain go up the other end, it\u2019s Victor Claver with a great shot. Australia go close, but they can\u2019t land - and Llull has a look from outside the arc.. and lands it! Huuuge. Gasol hits the first throw. And then the second! What absolute nerves of steel! Of ice! Of icy steel! Is that even a thing! Australia play with 4.6 - Delly tries from range, but it misses - we\u2019re off to double over-time!! Over-time 4 min: Spain 78-80 Australia Bogut. Creek. Dellavedova. Ingles. Creek. That\u2019s the five on the floor for Australia. Spain feed it in, they look for Gasol - and he\u2019s fouled by Dellavedova! He goes to the line for two - with 4.6 left on the shot clock. Big pressure on the big man. Over-time 4 min: Spain 78-80 Australia A double team on Mills, and Gasol is pinged for a foul on Patty. He\u2019ll go to the free throws, but it will mean Spain get last look basketball in hand perhaps. Huge free throws. Mills hits the first. And he hits the second! Time out called by Spain. They trail by two, 14.2 seconds to play. What can they conjure the European powerhouses. Over-time 4 min: Spain 78-78 Australia Kay with a rebound, but they can\u2019t get a shot away, Australia. Deary, deary me - it\u2019s another turnover: the Boomers\u2019 20th of the game. Spain miss their shot - it\u2019s so hard to get points out there. Ingles tries the three - no dice. And a foot violation! Gasol kicks the ball away and we\u2019ve got 16.3 seconds and Australia with 14 seconds on the shot clock! Lemanis calls a time out. Can they work this set play better? Over-time 3 min: Spain 78-78 Australia Llull runs into shot-clock trouble, and throws a three he didn\u2019t fancy - and misses. But having done the hard work, Australia turn it over on offence! Spain attack again and it\u2019s an offensive foul from Rubio on Mills! Over-time 3 min: Spain 78-78 Australia Claver is found by Rubio. Basket. Blocking foul from Spain on Ingles. They need him offensively, Australia - the hands are well and truly cold tonight. He goes to the stripe. Hits the first. Hits the second. Over-time 3 min: Spain 76-76 Australia Oh my! It\u2019s Marc Gasol - and he\u2019s bombed a huge one from three! Australia go up the other end: boom!! It\u2019s Patty Mills from three. And Nick Kay with another offensive rebound. How big has he been tonight - what a time to play your game of the tournament. And we\u2019re level again! Over-time 1 min: Spain 73-71 Australia And we\u2019re back. How\u2019s this game. Spain start with it - and it\u2019s an offensive foul on the first play!! Big error from Claver. Joe Ingles drives at the basket, but he\u2019s turned it over. He\u2019s shying away from the shot, and the pass doesn\u2019t land. Finally points and who else - it\u2019s Marc Gasol. He\u2019s the one man out there it seems who can\u2019t miss. Rubio argues the toss. Mills hits the first one. Scores locked! But he misses the second one!! Rubio throws a hail mary from down town - it rolls agonisingly round the rim, but doesn\u2019t drop! We\u2019re going to over-time!! Can you believe this. We\u2019ve got five minutes more. Fourth quarter 9 min - Spain 71-70 Australia A high pressure time out and discussion. There\u2019s a bit of confusion, but it\u2019s Bogut and Ingles expected to run the play. We\u2019re back on court. Mills feeds in - he charges to the basket and he\u2019s drawn the foul! Claver the infringer, Mills with two free throws! Match clock still at 4.7 seconds though. Fourth quarter 9 min - Spain 71-70 Australia Gasol lands the free throw to tie it. And then to take the lead! Can you believe this - they\u2019re back in front, Spain. Andrej Lemanis calls a time out. Australia have 8.7 seconds to execute this set play perfectly and win this game. This is epic. Fourth quarter 9 min - Spain 69-70 Australia Llull with an unlikely attempt, it looked ugly - but Bogut is called for a foul on Gasol under the bucket!! Huge call - Spain go to the stripe with 8.7 seconds on the clock. Gasol with two free throws - and then the Boomers have one play left. High drama! Fourth quarter 9 min - Spain 69-70 Australia Llull with a huge three point play but doesn\u2019t land it. Delly fires from three - he also misses. Before Kay gets an offensive rebound! Then Mills loses the ball into touch - was their a foul?? It\u2019s not paid! Oh my - 28 seconds to play. Spain call the time out and look to run the set play. They\u2019ve got this, haven\u2019t they. They\u2019ve trailed for most of the game, the World No 2 team - but they\u2019re coming home strong. I can\u2019t watch. Fourth quarter 9 min - Spain 69-70 Australia Kay with an open basket, but he can\u2019t land it!! No, no, no. 70 seconds left and it\u2019s Spain with the ball. Bogut comes in for a minute to play. They need old heads out there. Fourth quarter 8 min - Spain 69-70 Australia Ach. It\u2019s gone scrappy at the wrong time for the Boomers - Rubio is back in the game, and he\u2019s drawn an offensive foul from Baynes! Gasol goes up and scores. We\u2019ve a one-point game with 90 seconds! Fourth quarter 8 min - Spain 67-70 Australia He lands the first, the second, and the third! Gasol thinks about a three before taking on Baynes, but there\u2019s no foul and the Spaniard loses the ball into touch! Big defensive play! Offensively it\u2019s another turnover from the Boomers - these are creeping back in - and Rubio drives for two. Fourth quarter 6 min - Spain 65-67 Australia Delly with a spin shot - it\u2019s a bad possession and that never looked like landing. Gasol on Ingles - one referee calls offensive foul, the other defensive! They discuss - and it goes against Gasol. Mills pulls up for three, it just tickles wide, but he\u2019s fouled and goes to the line for three free throws! Fourth quarter 6 min - Spain 65-67 Australia A crucial basket to Spain and Andrej Lemanis calls a time out. This. Is.On. The Spaniards have been below form from the field, but they\u2019re coming here. What a nervous final 3-4 minutes: it\u2019s a Basketball World Cup semi-final, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter 6 min - Spain 63-67 Australia Mills on the cut from an Ingles feed. A settler. Rubio misses from three range, turnover from Australia before Ingles fouls. Gasol with a tough drive on Creek - he\u2019s come alive late on, the big 5. Creek misses at the other end, but it\u2019s Kay with an offensive rebound and score! But at the other end it\u2019s Ribas with another big three! Fourth quarter 4 min - Spain 58-63 Australia Gasol with a tough bucket, they didn\u2019t have much on that play but the star lands a key one. Bogut goes the other end and he\u2019s hit 10 points. Huge contribution, as he did in the quarter finals. Battle of the big men, as Gasol lands from outside the arc! HUGE. This is getting tight. Fourth quarter 3 min - Spain 53-61 Australia Spain are short a defender and Kay heads to the basket - he lands it, and Spain call a time out! A great start to the final quarter for Australia, but there\u2019s still SO much to run in this one. A 6-2 mini run for the Boomers though. Fourth quarter 2 min - Spain 53-59 Australia Llull looks for three of the screen, but it doesn\u2019t fall. Bogut grabs a sixth rebound. Mills inside for Landale but he can\u2019t get over Gasol. A desperate full stretch lunge from Dellavedova to retain possession - great hustle! And it\u2019s Bogut with an alley-oop - yeah, tha bois! Fourth quarter 1 min - Spain 53-57 Australia Mills to the basket and it\u2019s tipped in by Bogut - a necessary start to the final quarter. Rubio goes to the line and hits 2/2, to go 15 points for the game. Landale looks from three but misses it, a great feed from Dellavedova. He looks from closer range but misses that. Spain are screaming for an \u2018unsportsmanlike foul\u2019 on Rubio who clutches at his throat. It\u2019s not given. Rubio with a pull up shot for two, and Mills charges down the other end with time ticking away, but he\u2019s called for an offensive foul! It\u2019s a see-sawing third quarter, on points you\u2019d call it Spain\u2019s way, and more importantly they go into the break with the momentum! Australia\u2019s third-quarter curse strikes again - but they\u2019re still ahead, marginally. Third quarter 9 min - Spain 49-55 Australia Ribas with a stop and prop for two after Kay slams down up one end. Baynes looks for a three but can\u2019t land it. Rubio drives straight down the guts but it\u2019s a huge block from Baynes! And Rubio screams at the ref - but he\u2019s wrong. Baynes blocked before the ball hit the backboard. Tech foul, Mills hits the one-pointer from the stripe. Third quarter 8 min - Spain 47-52 Australia Goulding leaves the three-attempt short and Nick Kay claims the offensive rebound and is fouled. Nothing but net, 2/2. Ingles collides heavily with Rubio who replies with 2/2 of his own. Goulding dribbles with the ball off the Baynes screen but he loses the ball. Then at the other end it falls kindly and open to a man on the arc, it\u2019s Llull and he hits it clean! Huge moment - Dellavedova is screaming for a foul, it looked one, but wasn\u2019t paid, and Spain haul down a big play. Third quarter 7 min - Spain 42-50 Australia A very soft offensive third foul on Bogut - Australia don\u2019t need that. The big man will have to be careful, they can\u2019t afford him fouled out as per earlier in the tournament. A time out called by Australia - a set play opportunity for the Boomers and a nice settler perhaps. He\u2019s been so shrewd and calm all tournament, Andrej Lemanis - a real underappreciated factor in this incredible 6-0 Boomers World Cup run. Third quarter 7 min - Spain 42-50 Australia Llull tries to drive and is fouled en route to the basket, a second foul for Bogut. Llull hits 1/2 from the stripe. Mills tries the pull up from three and the rebound just evades Bogut. Mills tries again from a long long way outside the arc - no dice. Gasol slams one down, they needed that, Spain. Third quarter 5 min - Spain 39-50 Australia Kay is sent to the basket by Mills and it\u2019s a huge block from Gasol! Baynes tries from three but is well off, before Spain miss again from the field. They\u2019re just not dropping tonight for the World No 2 side! Rubio, on cue, misses again. Goulding with an assist for Kay - good patience and it\u2019s a Spanish time out as Australia go to a game-high 11-point lead! Third quarter 4 min - Spain 39-46 Australia Mills looks to fire from top of the arc, he misses but is fouled and will go to the line for three! A miss first up to whistles inside the arena and a miss third - a tense 1/3 from Mills. Gasol with a foul on Ingles - a big swipe from the big man. Third quarter 3 min - Spain 39-45 Australia If one big man can do it, so can the other: Aron Baynes finally on the board as he lands from three! Big play, and they\u2019re back out to six. Mills goes coast to coast and rolls off the glass. Claver tips in after a miss from three range from Hernandez. Heavy fall, and the Spaniard is not happy - he wants a foul. Second half! Third quarter 1 min - Spain 37-40 Australia Spain miss from the field with the first effort before who else - Mills from the pocket with three! Gasol lands this time before Patty misses with the next three, before the big man - Gasol lands a three! Ominous signs for Australia. Your thoughts on that first half? Australia shooting at 63% to 41% inside the arc, with the green &amp; gold also edging the rebounds column 21-19. 10 assists so far for the Boomers and while they\u2019ve coughed up 7-5 turnovers, compared to earlier games that\u2019s not too bad (hitting between 10-15 turnovers during some first halves earlier in the tournament). Eight different point scorers for Australia with only Aron Baynes missing out so far - Mills the points leader with 11. For Spain it\u2019s Rubio with nine and Juan Hernangomez with eight, but the latter is on three personal fouls. Could be something to target in the second half. Kay with a miss, before Delly fouls the big man Gasol. Big mismatch there, and a second personal for MD. The Spaniard hits 2/2 from the free throws. Mills misses a shot and Spain try the half-court hail mary on the buzzer. Not this time. It\u2019s a strong second quarter from Australia. Second quarter 9 min - Spain 30-37 Australia Hello! It\u2019s a three from Mills from the corner - more of that, please. Claver and Dellavedova come together off the ball - some aggro out there (and no surprise to see Delly in the middle of it perhaps). Second quarter 8 min - Spain 28-34 Australia Kay tips in off a terrific Delly pass. Rubio look at three, but misses. Ingles comes in on the drive, but pulls the shot short. Some nerves out there as Gasol misses a pass, before Dellavedova is called for an offensive foul, whilst being double teamed! Big dispute, he had his arm pinned, but the refs miss it. Second quarter 7 min - Spain 28-32 Australia Almost a steal from Spain before the shot clock forces Dellavedova to improvise and he pulls up short. Claver earns a foul from Baynes, which the big man disputes. Claver hits both free throws. Australia 4/13 from the three, 9/13 inside the arc. Second quarter 6 min - Spain 26-32 Australia Spain look for three - but miss again. Before Hernangomez is called for an offensive foul on Mills! Great D. Some frustration from Spain. A third personal for Hernangomez, Spain\u2019s leading rebounder! Rubio grabs another two. Lemanis calls a time out. Second quarter 5 min - Spain 24-32 Australia Four minutes without a bucket, Spain - what can they run from the set play? Rubio charges but it\u2019s a big block from Joe Ingles! Ball dead, but it\u2019s a Spanish ball. Finally Spain finish. And at the other end it\u2019s Landale with three! Then Creek recovers an offensive rebound for two. Wow. Second quarter 4 min - Spain 22-27 Australia Creek called for a foul on Gasol. A close up of Kobe Bryant in the crowd, and the Chinese home fans squeal in delight. Mills with two off the pick and roll, and that\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had a five-point difference all game, and the Spanish coach Sergio Scariola has seen enough. Time out. Second quarter 3 min - Spain 22-23 Australia Another miss from the field from Spain, Mills fires a three but it doesn\u2019t land. Now he leads with a charge, but it doesn\u2019t fall either - big defence from the Spanish tall timber. Yikes - nobody can land a point here. And Lemanis calls for a timeout. Second quarter 2 min - Spain 22-23 Australia Kay and Creek into the five, and it\u2019s a great feed from Delly to find the former. Ingles screams for a foul, but it\u2019s not forthcoming. Both sides miss good chances at each end, before great work from Creek forces the Spanish into touch. Big turnover - defences on top at this stage. A wild play from Australia with 5 seconds to run - as the Boomers miss the pass! With just over 3 seconds on the shot clock Spain throw the hail mary - and land a remarkable long-range bomb from Sergio Llull! What a key little moment - it\u2019s a five-point turnaround to send Spain in just in front. First quarter 9 min - Spain 19-21 Australia Ribas with two from the jump shot, they were almost in shot clock trouble there, Spain. Delly from three - and he pulls it down! Another two from Spain, it rolls agonisingly around the rim, but drops, before Bogut shows soft hands to rolls a short one. First quarter 8 min - Spain 15-16 Australia Bogut with an unlikely look from three - just his second attempt from that range all tournament and in fairness, it doesn\u2019t look great. Australia recover and Goulding pulls the trigger from three: also a miss! Spain miss from three - both teams are chasing the long rangers, and both are running hot and cold. Goulding goes to the line for free throws - 2/2. First quarter 7 min - Spain 15-14 Australia The big man Gasol goes to the stripe for the first free throws of the game. Two from two. Not bad for a 7 ft 1-er. And Australia\u2019s biggest Bogut goes up the other end and grabs two, before Nick Kay gets an important rebound. First quarter 5 min - Spain 11-12 Australia Hernangomez drops a three, Goulding comes into the game and replies straight away! Turnover from Spain, Delly gets a look at a three.. and he likes it. It\u2019s happening outside the arc from both teams. First quarter 4 min - Spain 8-6 Australia A rare complete airball from Rubio - he\u2019s really looking lively and looking to get ball in hand for Spain, and Andrej Lemanis has a chance to talk to his troops as the refereeing team examines the review system to check the shot clock. It takes a while - VAR anyone? First quarter 3 min - Spain 8-4 Australia Mills with the pull-up jump shot and it\u2019s nothing but net! He\u2019s averaging 22 a game, Australia need him on that form or better. Rubio misses at one end, before Spain\u2019s defence forces a ball loose from Ingles. Both teams trade three-shots, but both miss, before Juan Hernangomez pulls one down outside the arc. First quarter 1 min - Spain 5-2 Australia Spain get us underway and it\u2019s the lethal Ricky Rubio who lands the first three of the game. He comes up big at the other end the prevent an opening score from the Boomers before Joe Ingles eventually gets Australia going off the boards. Where will it won and lost? Australia have been far too free with turnovers - they\u2019ll need to cut those out of their game. And the hot-hands of Mills, Dellavedova and Goulding will need to continue, while not getting big men like Bogut or Baynes in foul trouble early. Ingles was down by his impeccable standards against the Czechs - hopefully he can step up and feed play with his remarkable run of assists this tournament - they\u2019re the second best nation in that stat. The players are out on the courts going through some last-minute warm ups before first tip, as we gather for the national anthems. So - to Spain, this massive powerhouse of world basketball - the last team apart from the US to taste World Cup gold. Men to watch: NBA star Ricky Rubio is averaging 15pts a game and five assists, Marc Gasol has chimed in with 11pts and five rebounds - but in truth there\u2019s not a poor player across this sublime Spanish roster. Your predictions ahead of this one? What\u2019s really dazzled for the Boomers is the depth of their performance. Despite missing NBA stars like Ben Simmons, Jonah Bolden or Dante Exum through injury or non-availability, to a man the 12 that are fighting for the green &amp; gold have stood tall. In one game it\u2019s the wily veteran Dellavedova, in another it\u2019s hot-hands Joe Ingles. The man-mountain Aron Baynes has been superb defensively (and not too shabby with the threes either), and his understudy Andrew Bogut saved his best for a ten-minute spell to blow open the Czechs in the quarters. Chris Goulding has shot well, Jock Landale has come up big at times - but above it all - Patty Mills has been imperious. Pure ice in the veins when it\u2019s mattered most. It\u2019s been an incredible tournament thus far from the Boomers, and unlike some of the other pools, there\u2019s been absolutely no easy games. The clever Canadians 108-92, a bruising clash with Senegal 81-68, and the passionate Baltic powerhouses (and World No 6) Lithuania 87-82 just for the group. Germany-slayers Dominican Republic 82-76, and then the big one - a pulsating 100-98 win over France courtesy a stunning steal from Patty Mills with the campaign looking 4.4 seconds away from a showdown with the US. Then of course the 82-70 win over a tough Czech Republic in the quarter-finals. It\u2019s been a hell of a tournament - the first time the Boomers have won 6-0 to start a campaign, but it\u2019s all on the wire today against Spain. Hola! Hi all, a pleasant welcome to you and yours from wherever around the globe you\u2019re following our coverage today. Not sure about you, but I\u2019m absolutely buzzing about this today. What a landmark game in Australian basketball - a match Shane Heal has called the biggest ever in the nation\u2019s history (at least in the men\u2019s game). If the Fiba WC has flown under your radar lately you can more than make amends by following along here. Or if you\u2019ve been bursting at the seams with all your pent up basketball fun facts at stats we want to hear from you! Fire me an email or tweet to join the conversation. After a scintillating tournament in which the Boomers have delivered near unerringly high-quality basketball, today comes their toughest challenge yet. After the shock elimination of the USA - the winners of the past five World Cups and Olympics - suddenly this is the most open Basketball World Cup in recent history. Australia have never finished in the top three at either a senior men\u2019s World Cup or Olympics - in fact this is the first time they\u2019ve made it to the final four at a senior men\u2019s World Cup. Standing in their way is Spain. The World No 2 side - and literal titans with six players over 2m tall. The nemesis from the Rio Games and the controversial last seconds bronze-medal loss. After a bruising and exhausting tournament the Boomers will need to be at their best if they\u2019re to book a first ever World Cup final berth. Follow it all - here.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m not sure if I will ever see a more extraordinary day in Westminster. It began with John Bercow making a 15-minute statement in which he announced he would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/john-bercow-to-step-down-as-speaker-by-31-october\">standing down </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/john-bercow-to-step-down-as-speaker-by-31-october\">by 31 October</a>. After that, dozens of MPs \u2013 almost all of them from the opposition parties, apart from Michael Gove who is the Tories\u2019 go-to man for insincerity \u2013 spent the best part of 90 minutes calling for points of order to praise Bercow for his role in defending parliament against the executive, standing up for backbenchers and promoting gender and race equality. All of which was true, though it was curious no one thought to mention the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/03/john-bercow-further-bullying-claims-emerge-against-house-of-commons-speaker\">allegations of bullying</a> and losing his temper with staff that have persisted throughout his time in office. Bercow merely basked in the attention and congratulated each MP for their perspicacity. Then the government lost two more votes: the first demanding that it publish the details of no-deal Brexit planning and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/what-is-prorogation-prorogue-parliament-boris-johnson-brexit\">the prorogation</a>; the second an attempt by Boris Johnson to force a general election \u2013 taking the prime minister\u2019s record to played six, lost six. Strictly speaking, he\u2019s also lost a couple more votes, but in parliamentary terms these are counted as pre-season friendlies. The session ended at about 2am with the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle sitting on the Speaker and other opposition MPs staging their own protests to try to delay prorogation. Much more of this and the EU wouldn\u2019t have us back even if we got on our knees and begged.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/10/geoffrey-boycott-theresa-may-knighthood\">Geoffrey Boycott was convicted of domestic assault, so why has May knighted him? | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/10/geoffrey-boycott-theresa-may-knighthood\">Geoffrey Boycott\u2019s knighthood</a> understandably created most of the headlines for Theresa May\u2019s resignation honours list. But other gongs offered an equally intriguing insight into the former prime minister\u2019s psyche. When David Cameron handed out baubles to all his staff, May said that his honours list made her physically retch. So she had presumably spent most of last weekend throwing her guts up as just about everyone who had ever stepped through the door of No 10 was rewarded with an honour. But it was her decision to offer CBEs to her former advisers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/10/nick-timothy-and-fiona-hill-unelected-advisers-who-acted-more-like-dpms\">Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy</a> that most intrigued me. Without Hill and Timothy insisting not only that she call a general election in 2017, but fight it on a duff manifesto with a presidential campaign entirely unsuited to someone with no personality, May might still be prime minister. On top of this, Timothy has spent much of this year writing opinion pieces for the Daily Telegraph in which he has repeatedly rubbished almost everything his ex-boss has done in regard to Brexit. In giving both Hill and Timothy honours, May has not only chosen to reward failure but has displayed a disturbing masochistic tendency. I\u2019m fairly certain that if I had honours within my gift, I wouldn\u2019t be doling them out to someone who had insulted and abused me. It makes me wonder what you would have had to do to May to be left off her list. Asking on behalf of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/20/theresa-may-brexit-speech-brussels-eu-pot-plants-sketch\">Four Pot Plants</a>, the only things in No 10 that never let her down.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Parliament being shut down hasn\u2019t made politics any less mad. I began the day at a speech in London given by Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who was outlining an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/jeremy-corbyn-rejects-call-tom-watson-labour-fully-back-remain\">entirely different Brexit plan</a> to the one Keir Starmer was delivering to the TUC conference in Brighton at the same time. Watson quoted at length from four great writers in his speech: Joseph Conrad, Dylan Thomas, Emily Bront\u00eb and ... Tom Watson. He has a new book out soon called Downsizing, about how he lost eight stone. If you have pounds, prepare to shed them now. The discrepancies in Labour\u2019s Brexit position were quickly overshadowed by a Scottish court\u2019s decision that Boris Johnson had misled parliament about the reasons for proroguing parliament, which forced the prime minister into a hasty denial that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/12/boris-johnson-says-claims-that-he-lied-to-queen-are-absolutely-not-true-video\">lied to the Queen</a>. If true, this would make Her Maj the first woman Johnson hadn\u2019t lied to in years. As if suffering from a guilty conscience at avoiding prime minister\u2019s questions and a two-hour interrogation from the liaison committee, Johnson then hastily arranged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/peoples-pmqs-boris-johnson-trolling-pm-smirky-mcsmirkface\">his own Facebook PMQs</a> for later in the day in which he answered questions carefully selected by Dominic Cummings for under 15 minutes. All of which meant I ended up working late and missing the launch of Marie Le Conte\u2019s book Haven\u2019t You Heard?, the inside story of gossip in Westminster. In the spirit of which, having already got a copy, I am happy to pass on that it is a cracking read. Treat yourself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/peoples-pmqs-boris-johnson-trolling-pm-smirky-mcsmirkface\">'People's PMQs': just more trolling from PM Smirky McSmirkface | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s that time of the year when unwanted mail in the form of my pension statements arrive. They do not make for comforting reading, especially this year\u2019s, which came with a covering letter explaining that my pension provider was closing down one of the funds my money was invested in because it was underperforming and the administration charges were too high, and switching it to another fund.

      "bodyText": "Monday I\u2019m not sure if I will ever see a more extraordinary day in Westminster. It began with John Bercow making a 15-minute statement in which he announced he would be standing down by 31 October. After that, dozens of MPs \u2013 almost all of them from the opposition parties, apart from Michael Gove who is the Tories\u2019 go-to man for insincerity \u2013 spent the best part of 90 minutes calling for points of order to praise Bercow for his role in defending parliament against the executive, standing up for backbenchers and promoting gender and race equality. All of which was true, though it was curious no one thought to mention the allegations of bullying and losing his temper with staff that have persisted throughout his time in office. Bercow merely basked in the attention and congratulated each MP for their perspicacity. Then the government lost two more votes: the first demanding that it publish the details of no-deal Brexit planning and the prorogation; the second an attempt by Boris Johnson to force a general election \u2013 taking the prime minister\u2019s record to played six, lost six. Strictly speaking, he\u2019s also lost a couple more votes, but in parliamentary terms these are counted as pre-season friendlies. The session ended at about 2am with the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle sitting on the Speaker and other opposition MPs staging their own protests to try to delay prorogation. Much more of this and the EU wouldn\u2019t have us back even if we got on our knees and begged. Tuesday Geoffrey Boycott\u2019s knighthood understandably created most of the headlines for Theresa May\u2019s resignation honours list. But other gongs offered an equally intriguing insight into the former prime minister\u2019s psyche. When David Cameron handed out baubles to all his staff, May said that his honours list made her physically retch. So she had presumably spent most of last weekend throwing her guts up as just about everyone who had ever stepped through the door of No 10 was rewarded with an honour. But it was her decision to offer CBEs to her former advisers Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy that most intrigued me. Without Hill and Timothy insisting not only that she call a general election in 2017, but fight it on a duff manifesto with a presidential campaign entirely unsuited to someone with no personality, May might still be prime minister. On top of this, Timothy has spent much of this year writing opinion pieces for the Daily Telegraph in which he has repeatedly rubbished almost everything his ex-boss has done in regard to Brexit. In giving both Hill and Timothy honours, May has not only chosen to reward failure but has displayed a disturbing masochistic tendency. I\u2019m fairly certain that if I had honours within my gift, I wouldn\u2019t be doling them out to someone who had insulted and abused me. It makes me wonder what you would have had to do to May to be left off her list. Asking on behalf of the Four Pot Plants, the only things in No 10 that never let her down. Wednesday Parliament being shut down hasn\u2019t made politics any less mad. I began the day at a speech in London given by Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who was outlining an entirely different Brexit plan to the one Keir Starmer was delivering to the TUC conference in Brighton at the same time. Watson quoted at length from four great writers in his speech: Joseph Conrad, Dylan Thomas, Emily Bront\u00eb and ... Tom Watson. He has a new book out soon called Downsizing, about how he lost eight stone. If you have pounds, prepare to shed them now. The discrepancies in Labour\u2019s Brexit position were quickly overshadowed by a Scottish court\u2019s decision that Boris Johnson had misled parliament about the reasons for proroguing parliament, which forced the prime minister into a hasty denial that he had lied to the Queen. If true, this would make Her Maj the first woman Johnson hadn\u2019t lied to in years. As if suffering from a guilty conscience at avoiding prime minister\u2019s questions and a two-hour interrogation from the liaison committee, Johnson then hastily arranged his own Facebook PMQs for later in the day in which he answered questions carefully selected by Dominic Cummings for under 15 minutes. All of which meant I ended up working late and missing the launch of Marie Le Conte\u2019s book Haven\u2019t You Heard?, the inside story of gossip in Westminster. In the spirit of which, having already got a copy, I am happy to pass on that it is a cracking read. Treat yourself. Thursday It\u2019s that time of the year when unwanted mail in the form of my pension statements arrive. They do not make for comforting reading, especially this year\u2019s, which came with a covering letter explaining that my pension provider was closing down one of the funds my money was invested in because it was underperforming and the administration charges were too high, and switching it to another fund. I\u2019d have been rather more grateful if they had managed my money properly from the start. Not that it would have made a great deal of difference as it seems the sum total of my pension pot to which I have been contributing for about 30 years is still pretty small. This, I should point out, is not my Guardian pension. But as I only became a full-time employee about 15 years ago, that is hardly a goldmine either. Nor does it help that it\u2019s mostly my fault as I never increased my contributions.

So now I find myself in my 60s and facing the prospect of working indefinitely or a retirement spent in poverty. It has made one decision marginally more simple, though. Given that the pension pot is negligible, I might as well take out a cash sum from my pension and spend it how I please. That way I might even fulfil a dream of owning a small Lucie Rie pot.

The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.</p>\n    <p>Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.</p>\n    <p>Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.</p>\n    <p>If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey\"><b>Daniel Boffey</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Both EU leaders were said to have felt that Johnson was someone with whom they could do business, according to diplomatic cables seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>But with Barnier, lamenting as recently as Thursday that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/12/michel-barnier-no-grounds-for-reopening-brexit-talks\">UK had failed to put any concrete proposals</a> in writing to replace the Irish backstop, that optimism has markedly receded.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will see in the coming weeks if the British are able to make concrete proposals in writing that are legally operational,\u201d Barnier told senior MEPs. \u201cWhile we have previously reached an agreement, as far as we can speak, we have no reason to be optimistic \u2026 I cannot tell you objectively whether contacts with the government of Mr Johnson will be able to reach an agreement by mid-October.\u201d</p> \n<p>EU sources said that the approach of the UK team was so hapless that officials had wondered whether Downing Street was seeking to push the commission negotiators to walk out.</p> \n<p>Asked on Friday whether there had been progress in the recent talks, the European commission spokeswoman said: \u201cTalks have resumed today and are ongoing as we speak.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s EU envoy, David Frost, is leading technical talks in Brussels on where the UK is seeking changes, but EU diplomats have accused him of offering only \u201caspirational\u201d ideas so far.</p> \n<p>A government spokesman said: \u201cThe UK has presented some ideas on an all-island [agrifood] solution.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will travel to what EU officials described as a \u201cneutral location\u201d in Luxembourg on Monday to meet Jean-Claude Juncker for the first time in an attempt to break the Brexit impasse. The talks will take place at a lunch hosted by Juncker in the European commission president\u2019s home country, where he was prime minister for 18 years. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who recently called for \u201cconcrete proposals from Downing Street\u201d, will join the two leaders. Johnson will then hold talks with the current prime minister of Luxembourg, Xavier Bettel. EU sources suggested Johnson had sought to avoid a meeting in Brussels for fear of giving the impression that he was begging for concessions. A European commission spokeswoman said Juncker would meet him for a \u201cworking lunch\u201d. She said the location had been chosen by \u201ccommon accord\u201d and that it would allow Juncker the benefit of going straight from the talks to Strasbourg, where the European parliament is sitting next week. She declined to disclose details about the precise location of the meeting. \u201cIt is taking place at a neutral location, which [we] will not disclose\u201d, she said. \u201cIt is a working lunch so you can imagine it is somewhere serving food.\u201d Johnson\u2019s communications team is understood to believe that Theresa May undermined herself in the public eye by making dashes to Brussels to seek movement in the negotiation. The prime minister has hinted at plans for further meetings with EU leaders in the weeks to come. His first visits in August \u2013 to Berlin and Paris to meet the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron \u2013 were widely seen as a success. Both EU leaders were said to have felt that Johnson was someone with whom they could do business, according to diplomatic cables seen by the Guardian. But with Barnier, lamenting as recently as Thursday that the UK had failed to put any concrete proposals in writing to replace the Irish backstop, that optimism has markedly receded. \u201cWe will see in the coming weeks if the British are able to make concrete proposals in writing that are legally operational,\u201d Barnier told senior MEPs. \u201cWhile we have previously reached an agreement, as far as we can speak, we have no reason to be optimistic \u2026 I cannot tell you objectively whether contacts with the government of Mr Johnson will be able to reach an agreement by mid-October.\u201d EU sources said that the approach of the UK team was so hapless that officials had wondered whether Downing Street was seeking to push the commission negotiators to walk out. Asked on Friday whether there had been progress in the recent talks, the European commission spokeswoman said: \u201cTalks have resumed today and are ongoing as we speak.\u201d Johnson\u2019s EU envoy, David Frost, is leading technical talks in Brussels on where the UK is seeking changes, but EU diplomats have accused him of offering only \u201caspirational\u201d ideas so far. A government spokesman said: \u201cThe UK has presented some ideas on an all-island [agrifood] solution. Further discussions between teams will take place next week.\u201d In an interview with Juncker to be broadcast on Sunday by the German radio station Deutschlandfunk, the commission president has said he is not optimistic about striking a deal with Johnson. He is also reported to have warned that a no-deal Brexit would cause chaos and take years to put right. Juncker tells the station: \u201cAnyone who loves his country, and I assume that there are still patriots in Britain, would not want to wish his country such a fate.\u201d Juncker accused the British earlier this week of being \u201cpart-time Europeans\u201d since joining the European Economic Community in 1973. \u201cThe British were told for more than 40 years that they were in, but they didn\u2019t want to share all the policies that have been decided,\u201d he said. \u201cThe British since the very beginning were part-time Europeans. What we need are full-time Europeans.\u201d Asked whether he believed there was \u201ca special place in hell for those who promoted Brexit\u201d, as the European council president, Donald Tusk, had said earlier this year, Juncker told the Euronews channel he did not believe in hell.",

He will retain a strong presence in the form of his team and his studio \u2013 he has a 99-year lease on the building. \u201cBerlin will always be one of my bases. I will keep coming back,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He remains hopeful that one day he and his family will be able to travel back to China. \u201cMy son is so interested in it. He knows I am missing China, and went back once to my studio and held my cats for me for half an hour. He wanted to do that for me. I have often taken him with me, to Brazil or Mexico, often dangerous places, sometimes to parties. But he\u2019s so tired of my art, my propaganda.

But his experiences so far had shown people to be kind and helpful. \u201cAnd I love the trees, there are so many of them. But most importantly, my son needs a nest and we hope that he will find it in Cambridge.\u201d</p>",

Benbihy complained that Ai\u2019s two-minute scene was \u201ctoo political\u201d, which the artist said this was further proof that he was now considered a \u201cliability\u201d. The artist was speaking in his subterranean studio in eastern Berlin, a 4,000 sq m catacomb, 10 metres below ground, before the opening of Roots, his latest exhibition in the city at the neugerriemschneider gallery, a version of which will be shown at Lisson Gallery in London from October. At its heart are seven large iron sculptures based on wax casts from trees native to the Brazilian rainforests, inspired by a poem by his father, Ai Qing, and visits the artist made to the forests. \u201cI had been working on this for years,\u201d he said, \u201cand now it has met its own purpose at a time when we are seeing the devastating effects of the rightist leader of Brazil, whose privatisation of those forests \u2013 which provide 20% of Earth\u2019s oxygen \u2013 has prompted a money grab devoid of any moral or ecological judgment, leading to these huge fires which have been raging for two months.\u201d He said he could see the parallels between the destruction caused by rampant capitalism in Brazil and the attempts by Chinese authorities to crush the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which he was following closely via contacts on the ground, including his own team of film-makers, and social media. \u201cThose campaigning against these destructive forces are courageous and clever, but I fear they are very fragile compared to what they are up against.\u201d Ai has yet to have an official meeting with Merkel \u2013 only bumping into her by chance at a Chinese restaurant near her flat \u2013 but said he planned to write to thank her and explain his decision to leave. \u201cI understand she couldn\u2019t meet me, because she has to consider Germany\u2019s dealings with China,\u201d he said, noting she has travelled there 12 times during her chancellery. \u201cBut she\u2019s the first person I want to show my gratitude towards, because she helped with my release. Even if she\u2019s being practical and shoring up Germany\u2019s future by keeping good relations with China, she has the integrity to put a public issue \u2013 like Hong Kong or the refugees \u2013 in front of the world, and for that we really are very grateful.\u201d Despite his latest show being described as a \u201cmonumental final greeting\u201d to Berlin by one art critic, Ai insisted he was not turning his back on the city. He will retain a strong presence in the form of his team and his studio \u2013 he has a 99-year lease on the building. \u201cBerlin will always be one of my bases. I will keep coming back,\u201d he said. He remains hopeful that one day he and his family will be able to travel back to China. \u201cMy son is so interested in it. He knows I am missing China, and went back once to my studio and held my cats for me for half an hour. He wanted to do that for me. I have often taken him with me, to Brazil or Mexico, often dangerous places, sometimes to parties. But he\u2019s so tired of my art, my propaganda. He once said to me, \u2018No more Ai Weiwei.\u2019\u201d Ten days in the UK led him to believe British food was \u201cdisastrous: there are so few fruits and vegetables, maybe because people start drinking in the morning\u201d. But his experiences so far had shown people to be kind and helpful. \u201cAnd I love the trees, there are so many of them. But most importantly, my son needs a nest and we hope that he will find it in Cambridge.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Top 2020 candidates disagree on healthcare and immigration Joe Biden at last shared a debate stage with his biggest rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday night in Houston, demonstrating clear differences with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on healthcare, immigration and foreign policy. But all 10 candidates in the largely conciliatory exchange aimed their ire most squarely at a single target: Donald Trump. Joan E Greve outlines the debate\u2019s key takeaways, while the Guardian\u2019s panel of experts fails to identify a clear winner. Weak and strong. Richard Wolffe says Biden has a big lead but no momentum, which made him both the strongest and weakest candidate on stage. Bhashkar Sunkara says his dominance is a reminder that the Democratic party is still centrist at its core. Death threat? After the debate, Twitter removed a tweet by a Texas GOP lawmaker, in which he took aim at Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s gun control stance, warning \u201cmy AR is ready for you\u201d. Trump\u2019s border wall construction begins in Unesco reserve To the dismay of environmental groups, construction has begun on a section of Donald Trump\u2019s coveted US-Mexico border wall along the southern edge of Arizona\u2019s Organ Pipe Cactus national monument, a federally protected wilderness area and Unesco-recognized reserve. Amanda Munro of the Southwest Environmental Center said the planned barrier would require \u201cbulldozing one of the most biologically diverse regions\u201d in the US, calling it \u201ca colossal mistake and a national tragedy\u201d. Wetlands protection. The Trump administration has revoked an Obama-era regulation shielding many US wetlands and streams from pollution. Farmers and developers claimed the rule dented economic development and infringed on property rights. Crew slept as California boat caught fire, say investigators Federal investigators say all six crew members aboard the doomed diving boat Conception were asleep when the vessel caught fire off the coast of southern California in the small hours of 2 September, killing 34 people who were trapped below deck. The information was revealed on Thursday in a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board, and could lead to charges under a statute known as seaman\u2019s manslaughter. Keeping watch. The law stipulates that at least one crew member ought to have been awake and keeping watch overnight. All but one of the six crew survived the blaze, the cause of which is yet to be determined. How the UK\u2019s Brexit drama became a crisis The outgoing Speaker of the UK\u2019s House of Commons, John Bercow, has said he will tear up traditional parliamentary procedure to prevent the prime minister, Boris Johnson, dragging the country out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. His pledge to enforce MPs\u2019 will comes as Johnson was forced to deny misleading the Queen about his reasons for suspending parliament until mid-October. Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent, tells the full story of an extraordinary 10 days in the Brexit crisis. \u2018Misleading\u2019 campaign. Opposition MPs have condemned the Johnson government\u2019s \u00a3100m \u201cGet ready for Brexit\u201d advertising campaign, ostensibly intended to prepare the British public for no deal on 31 October, as \u201credundant and misleading\u201d. Cheat sheet The progressive Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has condemned a Republican TV ad broadcast during the debate in Houston, which described her as \u201cthe face of socialism\u201d while showing a burning photograph of her face. Gregory Cheadle, the black man to whom Trump referred as \u201cmy African American\u201d during a campaign rally in California in 2016, has quit the Republican party, citing the president\u2019s \u201cwhite superiority complex\u201d. Brazil\u2019s controversial environment minister, Ricardo Salles, is to meet representatives from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a rightwing US group that denies climate change, in Washington in the run-up to the UN climate action summit. A 14-year-old Kenyan girl who had her period during a lesson killed herself after a teacher allegedly called her dirty and expelled her from the classroom. The case has reignited a national debate about \u201cperiod shaming\u201d and access to menstrual products. Must-reads The greatest films of the century\u2026 so far The Guardian\u2019s film writers have compiled a list of the 100 best films of the 21st century, guaranteed to enthuse and enrage in equal measure. The director of their No 1 pick reacts to the honour, Peter Bradshaw explains why it\u2019s a masterpiece and some of the other film-makers listed select their own favourites. Kentucky mixes church and state \u2013 in schools Christians in Kentucky have succeeded in what seems a modest aim: mandating the state\u2019s schools to prominently display the words \u201cIn God we trust\u201d. But critics say it\u2019s part of a nationwide effort by conservative Christian nationalist groups to inject religion into society, as Josh Wood reports from Louisville. Should we clarify our pronouns when we say hello? The trans YouTube star Natalie Wynn provoked the internet\u2019s ire after tweeting that she wasn\u2019t always fond of \u201cpronoun introductions\u201d, whereby people say their preferred pronouns when offering their names. It\u2019s often a positive step to a better understanding of gender, but Arwa Mahdawi agrees it\u2019s complicated. How a podcast about celebrity became a \u2018recipe for joy\u2019 The podcast Who? Weekly is devoted to explaining the fame of minor, wannabe \u201cWho?\u201d celebrities to its baffled listenership, which includes real \u201cThem\u201d celebrities Lena Dunham and Busy Phillips. \u201c\u2018Who?/Them\u2019 is not actually a value judgment. It\u2019s literally just a categorisation,\u201d its co-host Lindsey Weber assures Steph Harmon. \u201cIt\u2019s totally out of love.\u201d Opinion The EU has nominated a minister with responsibility for protecting the \u201cEuropean way of life\u201d, a job that incorporates the management of migration.

This is received political wisdom among the technocrats who have dominated politics in western Europe for years: take a tough stance on border control to address the \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d of \u201cordinary people\u201d and the populists will lose their sting.

      "body": "<p>\u201cA long leg, an almost 70s flare.\u201d This was a sentence I wrote in my notebook back in January during the men\u2019s AW19 fashion shows. These were the words of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jan/16/clare-waight-keller-unveils-perverse-posh-menswear-collection-for-givenchy\" title=\"\">Clare Waight Keller</a>, the designer at Givenchy who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/perfect-wedding-dress-for-a-californian-royal-clare-waight-keller-givenchy\" title=\"\">dressed Meghan Markle for her big day</a>. The flare is part of a new era for menswear at the Parisian house, marking a distinct shift from the previous administration, where the brand had come to be defined by streetwear, and a sellout <a href=\"https://www.givenchy.com/gb/en/men/?q=rottweiler*&amp;cmpid&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvZjs_cST5AIVTETTCh2Y3gKZEAAYASAAEgKtQfD_BwE\" title=\"\">rottweiler-emblazoned sweatshirt</a>. Flared trouser suits in strong red and a fabulous teal blue appeared on models walking through Givenchy\u2019s couture salon in Paris. It all rippled with a breeze of expensive glamour. Waight Keller cited not just the 70s but the 90s as inspiration, another era with a strong flared trouser game, if you think of Britpop stars such as the mighty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jarvis-cocker\" title=\"\">Jarvis Cocker</a>. </p> <p>Fast-forward a season, to the close of the SS20 men\u2019s shows in June. I posted <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/schilvers3/?hl=en\" title=\"\">on Instagram</a> an image from the Celine show by Hedi Slimane, captioned: \u201cA flared Celine jean. That\u2019s all, Paris.\u201d Slimane\u2019s model army strode the runway en masse for a finale rammed to the hilt with flared trouser hems, underlining the fact that the flares trend looks likely to have legs, as it were. I left this show with a head full of images of Yves Saint Laurent during the 70s, on a rooftop in Morocco. I was also more than a little obsessed with the idea of getting my legs into a pair of Hedi\u2019s new jeans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc5cd8f34f7c78ac6612983bea55cc4beea8daa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc5cd8f34f7c78ac6612983bea55cc4beea8daa1/0_0_7111_4267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left to right: all the flares, on the Marni, Celine and Balenciaga catwalks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left to right: all the flares, on the Marni, Celine and Balenciaga catwalks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Between these two moments, Quentin Tarantino\u2019s new film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-tarantino-dazzling-dicaprio-pitt\" title=\"\">Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</a> had premiered at Cannes. On screen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio\" title=\"\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> wears, among other variations on this bottom-half theme, a pair of peachy-pink flared trousers. These were specifically created by costume designer and stylist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ariannephillips/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Arianne Phillips</a>. The trousers had already made tabloid headlines during filming last October. \u201cPink Pants-er\u201d was a particularly choice pun.</p> <p>So, with some serious style endorsements of the flare, is it time to quit your designer jogging pants and/or \u2013 finally \u2013 ditch those infamous skinny jeans? Probably. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/14/interview-donatella-versace-my-brothers-death-made-me-strong\" title=\"\">Donatella Versace</a>, whose latest show featured flares in both house signature prints and black, wants you to strongly contemplate the notion. \u201cMen, I think, are having way more fun than before, experimenting with new silhouettes, colours and prints, and the flare pants are part of that process of exploring one\u2019s own personal style I have been doing for a few seasons,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9194b2faa7786af95e6b2204377cd465aa04b047\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9194b2faa7786af95e6b2204377cd465aa04b047/0_0_7111_4267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left to right: Gucci designer Alessandro Michele, Another Man editor-in-chief and street style star Ben Cobb and Donatella Versace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left to right: Gucci designer Alessandro Michele, Another Man editor-in-chief and street style star Ben Cobb and Donatella Versace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Versace herself has often taken her end-of-show bow in a kick flare. She thinks a man in flares reeks of confidence. \u201cThe attitude I had in mind was, \u2018I like it, so I wear it.\u2019 Like everything else in a man\u2019s wardrobe, whenever you change or introduce a new element, there are a lot of people who are sceptical. More than ever, though, we live in a world where people are encouraged to express themselves \u2013 be it through one\u2019s own ideas or style. And I love it!\u201d</p> <p>Elisabeth Murray, fashion curator at the V&amp;A in London, cites Tom Ford\u2019s SS00 Gucci men\u2019s collection as a significant flares moment, including \u201ca particularly daring python pair\u201d. She thinks the flare comeback is part cyclical, part a general interest in the 70s from designers. \u201cFlares are a way to inject fun and frivolity into menswear,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich is something we\u2019re seeing on the catwalk.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"873c589c2596b7d78af4d12ed0d22d3ba36ee807\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/873c589c2596b7d78af4d12ed0d22d3ba36ee807/0_0_2480_3508/707.jpg\" alt=\"Inspired by glam rock style...Lenny Kravitz on stage at Wembley Arena, 1993\" width=\"707\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inspired by glam rock style...Lenny Kravitz on stage at Wembley Arena, 1993</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Dickson/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With menswear dominated by streetwear and cult sneakers for a decade or so, the flare could be seen as part of a shift back to dressing up. Suiting has been reinvented again by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kim-jones\" title=\"\">Kim Jones</a> at Dior and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/virgil-abloh\" title=\"\">Virgil Abloh</a> at Louis Vuitton \u2013 two designers who have often been seen as integral to \u201csports luxe\u201d. The styling of suiting on runways isn\u2019t about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\" title=\"\">Mad Men</a>-style professionalism. Designs are cut away from the body and worn with wider trousers for a more louche and easy silhouette. Flares are part of a new wave of upscale chic \u2013 the opposite of the familiar body-conscious skinny jeans \u2013 crossed with, as Versace says, a new experimentation in men\u2019s fashion.</p> <p>Murray references noughties Gucci as a moment, and Gucci circa now is also key to the flare comeback. Designer Alessandro Michele has featured them in his menswear since 2016 and they are central to the retro maximalism that has become Gucci\u2019s calling card. Michele wears them himself \u2013 as seen on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/met-ball\" title=\"\">Met </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/met-ball\" title=\"\">ball</a> red carpet in May. This season, Gucci featured velvet suits with bell-bottoms, so the designer is not getting tired of the shape.</p> <p>Other brands are also onboard. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\" title=\"\">Balenciaga</a> have been toying with boot-cut denim. Martine Rose \u2013 a British designer who loves a wide slack \u2013 has featured various flared styles for her label and Fendi\u2019s trousers have also recently had a kick to their ankle. Plus the first men\u2019s runway collection by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/15/loewe-craft-prize-winner-jonathan-anderson-antidote-to-digital-media\" title=\"\">Jonathan Anderson</a> for Loewe \u2013 arriving in stores now \u2013 features a fantastic pink tuxedo styled with a pair of definitely-swingy-at-the-hem trousers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e94175b9e550f929355f261a5b733d81b4aad5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e94175b9e550f929355f261a5b733d81b4aad5d/496_177_3176_1906/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cSexually topsy-turvy.\u201d Jimi Hendrix, pictured here performing in New York, 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cSexually topsy-turvy.\u201d Jimi Hendrix, pictured here performing in New York, 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walter Iooss Jr/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Flares have a history that means almost infinite images to mine for inspiration. Sailors are thought to have been the first to adopt bell-bottom trousers in the 19th century, partly because they rolled up easily, while <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/oxford-bags-pants\">Oxford bags</a> in the 20s saw the circumference of a hem reach over a metre. It was the late 60s when flares took off. By 1969, they were so popular that astronauts on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/apollo-11-moon-landing\" title=\"\">Apollo 11</a> reportedly wore their spacesuit slacks with a flare. By the 70s, they were on Sonny &amp; Cher\u2019s TV show, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/14/studio-54-ultimate-den-of-vice-photographs-hasse-persson\" title=\"\">Studio 54</a> dancefloor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/may/20/the-eurovision-song-contest-10-of-the-best-abba-conchita-wurst\" title=\"\">Abba at Eurovision</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/17/slade-we-dont-do-no-rock-operas-were-doin-a-cock-opera\" title=\"\">Slade</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/feb/05/good-time-the-greatest-moments-of-maurice-white-and-earth-wind-fire\" title=\"\">Earth, Wind </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/feb/05/good-time-the-greatest-moments-of-maurice-white-and-earth-wind-fire\" title=\"\">&amp; Fire</a>. Even footballers wore them as part of suits off-pitch circa 1977. Naturally, as all fashions do, they peaked by the end of the decade, replaced by the drainpipes \u2013 proto-skinny jeans \u2013 favoured by punks.

      "bodyText": "\u201cA long leg, an almost 70s flare.\u201d This was a sentence I wrote in my notebook back in January during the men\u2019s AW19 fashion shows. These were the words of Clare Waight Keller, the designer at Givenchy who dressed Meghan Markle for her big day. The flare is part of a new era for menswear at the Parisian house, marking a distinct shift from the previous administration, where the brand had come to be defined by streetwear, and a sellout rottweiler-emblazoned sweatshirt. Flared trouser suits in strong red and a fabulous teal blue appeared on models walking through Givenchy\u2019s couture salon in Paris. It all rippled with a breeze of expensive glamour. Waight Keller cited not just the 70s but the 90s as inspiration, another era with a strong flared trouser game, if you think of Britpop stars such as the mighty Jarvis Cocker. Fast-forward a season, to the close of the SS20 men\u2019s shows in June. I posted on Instagram an image from the Celine show by Hedi Slimane, captioned: \u201cA flared Celine jean. That\u2019s all, Paris.\u201d Slimane\u2019s model army strode the runway en masse for a finale rammed to the hilt with flared trouser hems, underlining the fact that the flares trend looks likely to have legs, as it were. I left this show with a head full of images of Yves Saint Laurent during the 70s, on a rooftop in Morocco. I was also more than a little obsessed with the idea of getting my legs into a pair of Hedi\u2019s new jeans. Between these two moments, Quentin Tarantino\u2019s new film Once Upon A Time In Hollywood had premiered at Cannes. On screen, Leonardo DiCaprio wears, among other variations on this bottom-half theme, a pair of peachy-pink flared trousers. These were specifically created by costume designer and stylist Arianne Phillips. The trousers had already made tabloid headlines during filming last October. \u201cPink Pants-er\u201d was a particularly choice pun. So, with some serious style endorsements of the flare, is it time to quit your designer jogging pants and/or \u2013 finally \u2013 ditch those infamous skinny jeans? Probably. Donatella Versace, whose latest show featured flares in both house signature prints and black, wants you to strongly contemplate the notion. \u201cMen, I think, are having way more fun than before, experimenting with new silhouettes, colours and prints, and the flare pants are part of that process of exploring one\u2019s own personal style I have been doing for a few seasons,\u201d she said. Versace herself has often taken her end-of-show bow in a kick flare. She thinks a man in flares reeks of confidence. \u201cThe attitude I had in mind was, \u2018I like it, so I wear it.\u2019 Like everything else in a man\u2019s wardrobe, whenever you change or introduce a new element, there are a lot of people who are sceptical. More than ever, though, we live in a world where people are encouraged to express themselves \u2013 be it through one\u2019s own ideas or style. And I love it!\u201d Elisabeth Murray, fashion curator at the V&amp;A in London, cites Tom Ford\u2019s SS00 Gucci men\u2019s collection as a significant flares moment, including \u201ca particularly daring python pair\u201d. She thinks the flare comeback is part cyclical, part a general interest in the 70s from designers. \u201cFlares are a way to inject fun and frivolity into menswear,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich is something we\u2019re seeing on the catwalk.\u201d With menswear dominated by streetwear and cult sneakers for a decade or so, the flare could be seen as part of a shift back to dressing up. Suiting has been reinvented again by the likes of Kim Jones at Dior and Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton \u2013 two designers who have often been seen as integral to \u201csports luxe\u201d. The styling of suiting on runways isn\u2019t about a Mad Men-style professionalism. Designs are cut away from the body and worn with wider trousers for a more louche and easy silhouette. Flares are part of a new wave of upscale chic \u2013 the opposite of the familiar body-conscious skinny jeans \u2013 crossed with, as Versace says, a new experimentation in men\u2019s fashion. Murray references noughties Gucci as a moment, and Gucci circa now is also key to the flare comeback. Designer Alessandro Michele has featured them in his menswear since 2016 and they are central to the retro maximalism that has become Gucci\u2019s calling card. Michele wears them himself \u2013 as seen on the Met ball red carpet in May. This season, Gucci featured velvet suits with bell-bottoms, so the designer is not getting tired of the shape. Other brands are also onboard. Balenciaga have been toying with boot-cut denim. Martine Rose \u2013 a British designer who loves a wide slack \u2013 has featured various flared styles for her label and Fendi\u2019s trousers have also recently had a kick to their ankle. Plus the first men\u2019s runway collection by Jonathan Anderson for Loewe \u2013 arriving in stores now \u2013 features a fantastic pink tuxedo styled with a pair of definitely-swingy-at-the-hem trousers. Flares have a history that means almost infinite images to mine for inspiration. Sailors are thought to have been the first to adopt bell-bottom trousers in the 19th century, partly because they rolled up easily, while Oxford bags in the 20s saw the circumference of a hem reach over a metre. It was the late 60s when flares took off. By 1969, they were so popular that astronauts on Apollo 11 reportedly wore their spacesuit slacks with a flare. By the 70s, they were on Sonny &amp; Cher\u2019s TV show, the Studio 54 dancefloor, Abba at Eurovision, Slade, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. Even footballers wore them as part of suits off-pitch circa 1977. Naturally, as all fashions do, they peaked by the end of the decade, replaced by the drainpipes \u2013 proto-skinny jeans \u2013 favoured by punks. Flares would not return until the 90s, once again associated with music, from Britpop to grunge and rave. Phillips says the clothes DiCaprio wears are representative of various changes happening in 1969 in politics, Hollywood and fashion. His character, Rick Dalton, a 50s TV cowboy actor, is, Phillips says, trying to be considered relevant in this new era. \u201cHe has many costume changes in this film, one of which is the sherbet peachy-pink flares worn when we see Rick making an effort to keep up with the changing times.\u201d But what do flares semaphore in 2019? Ben Cobb, editor-in-chief of Another Man (and street style favourite), is a poster boy for the flared look and has been wearing the style since he was 17, when he picked up a pair of 70s flared jeans.

      "bodyText": "Metronomy Wedding Bells Scratch beneath the titanium coating and Metronomy\u2019s Joe Mount is fast becoming the ice-tronic Fred off First Dates. Once, he sang about Love Letters like a chillwave Supremes, now he\u2019s escaping his best friend\u2019s wedding to hide in a garden, likely amid rumours of a paid bar. Brilliantly, he does it while playing his Boys of Summer joker; every musician gets one voucher per career allowing them to rip off Don Henley for one surefire smacker. Ding-dong. Grimes &amp; i_o Violence Grimes, because she is Grimes, plans every song on her new album to represent a different embodiment of human extinction taken on by an anthropomorphic goddess of climate change. Because nothing will ram home the implications of global warming like watching it dance in a bodysuit wielding a sword. So, if last year\u2019s We Appreciate Power was about humanity being wiped out by AI, the glacial synthpop of Violence presumably represents us drowning in a rising tide of Chvrches records. Foals The Runner Barely have we bet our firstborn on Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost \u2013 Part 1 bagging the Mercury prize when Part 2 arrives. Set in the aftermath of Part 1\u2019s environmental meltdown, the new record\u2019s second single envisions a wasteland ruled over by a funky android Royal Blood. Relentless orders to \u201ckeep on running\u201d suggest less Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, more Paula Radcliffe beyond lavatory, but it\u2019s Foals, it\u2019s massive. Francis and the Lights ft Bon Iver &amp; Kanye West Take Me to the Light Give Francis Farewell Starlite credit, the Drake producer will go to such meticulous lengths to cover up a duff R&amp;B tune it would put a podcast-worthy serial killer to shame. Force nine AutoTune, more glitches than a Boris Brexit, and the ultimate distraction tactic, AKA Kanye appearing alongside Justin Vernon, who\u2019s fast becoming the Rick Astley to Ye\u2019s Dave Grohl. Squid Match Bet The latest proponents of what no one\u2019s calling crank-wave, avant-punks Squid are raising awareness of the dangers of repeated exposure to Sonic Youth\u2019s Washing Machine. The (real-life) protagonist of Match Bet is such a Thurston stan he has developed a gambling problem and thinks he\u2019s mates with the Queen. Compiling his batshit ramblings into a motoric yelp is inspired aversion therapy indeed.",

We have to trust each other and stick together.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the protests have divided society, some groups have sought to act as objective observers. Since mid-August, the Hong Kong Neutral Legal Observers Group, a group of about 50 volunteers from the legal sector, have been attending the protests.</p> \n<p>In green vests identifying themselves as neutral, they attend the protests in shifts, documenting their observations for reports to be published later.

Victoria Hui, an associate professor of political science at Notre Dame University, said: \u201cThey were already there to jump into action. As the protests have evolved, preexisting groups and new groups have emerged to fill new needs.\u201d In some ways they are also a reaction to what some see as the creeping politicisation of civil society, as pro-Beijing figures are appointed to head different public sectors. Hui said: \u201cThe worry is that Beijing already encroached on the civil service in the aftermath of the umbrella movement.\u201d Unlike formal civil society organisations, these groups are loosely organised and often started by individual calls for action online, mirroring how the protesters have operated. A group of Christians maintain a 24-hour channel on Telegram for protesters to share their feelings. Supporters organise supply collections, leaving money, food vouchers, and clothes in metro stations for protesters to change into from their signature all-black outfits. A group of volunteer doctors and nurses help injured protesters who are afraid to go to hospitals where police have arrested demonstrators. Observers say the growth of these satellite protest groups is evidence of the public sympathy demonstrators still command, even after months of political unrest that has damaged one of the strongest economies in the region. On 1 September, as protesters paralysed traffic links between the airport and the city and demonstrators began a seven-mile (12km) walk back to the city, Daniel, 42, was one of hundreds of volunteer drivers who had arrived to ferry stranded protesters home. Daniel, a government worker who had never volunteered before, was watching a livestream on Facebook when he saw the call for drivers. After discussing it with his wife, he arrived at a nearby bridge where dozens of drivers had converged and a volunteer told him where to go. Daniel stayed out until almost 2am, waiting in case he could be of assistance. He said: \u201cThey are Hong Kong\u2019s future. I want to do something to help them. We have to trust each other and stick together.\u201d As the protests have divided society, some groups have sought to act as objective observers. Since mid-August, the Hong Kong Neutral Legal Observers Group, a group of about 50 volunteers from the legal sector, have been attending the protests. In green vests identifying themselves as neutral, they attend the protests in shifts, documenting their observations for reports to be published later. They also hold public workshops educating residents on their legal rights and obligations. \u201cOur purpose is to observe public gatherings and defend the rule of law,\u201d said one of the conveners of the group, a partner in the Hong Kong office of an international law firm, who asked not to be named out of concern of possible retribution. \u201cWe hope that the presence of lawyers might serve as a reminder of how important it is to respect the law and the rule of law.\u201d Additional reporting by Edwin Lee and An Rong Xu",

      "bodyText": "Who would you give a knighthood to? It\u2019s a question that has preoccupied Britain this week after former prime minister Theresa May conferred honours on a few personal favourites, including a former cricketer convicted of domestic assault and political advisers whose advice turned out to be not so shrewd. The list raises an obvious question: what is an honours system for? Should it be for people who play games for a living? For people who were simply doing their job? Should it be for people whom life has already rewarded \u2013 with fame, wealth, status, fans, admiration? Or should it be for unsung heroes whose celebration might encourage more of us to volunteer, give, sacrifice? So come on Upsiders, now is your chance. Email us at theupside@theguardian.com with a name (obscure, well known, old, young, British, foreign, we don\u2019t mind) and a short statement as to why they deserve to be Upside Legends. We will publish the best responses here. If you agree with Galileo and think the whole system is a nonsense, now is your time to vent. As food for thought, there are plenty of good candidates for Upside Legends in our weekly Upside offerings, in particular: 1. The people of St Ives, trying to turn their town into a paragon of mental health (three-minute read). 2. The psychiatrist rescuing mentally ill people from the streets of India (two-minute read). 3. The medics who have dramatically improved cancer survival rates in the developed world over the past 20 years (two-minute read). 4. The researchers trying to save the northern white rhino using IVF (18-month gestation period). 5. New tech to help disabled people (90-second read). Lucky numbers Beijing\u2019s air is getting better. Actually, the same is true in the UK: better, though perhaps not yet good enough. Also, somewhat randomly, in some eastern European countries, more than half of all scientists are women, according to the Economist. What we liked This piece from Positive News looks at the various groups standing up to online bullying, a pervasive problem that causes mental illness. We\u2019re also intrigued by this plan to give Americans $50 to donate to a news outlet of their choice \u2013 a measure to breathe new life and funding into a moribund sector. What we heard From Celine Pompeia in Brazil: There\u2019s a nice story in the Brazilian newspaper \u201cA Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo\u201d, Sept 9, page A3, about the benefits gained by prisoners given access to books. There does seem to be lots of evidence of the benefits of giving prisoners something to do and something to aim for. And Anthony wrote in by email: We need to establish ways to reward people that don\u2019t encourage a larger carbon footprint. Paying an income for people to live on is fine, but our culture is to incentivise and reward through further payment and that\u2019s problematic.

And his act of public penitence, on Tuesday, has once again thrust this colonial atrocity into the public limelight, 100 years after it took place. Justin Welby\u2019s heartfelt apology provided a stark contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/14/calls-for-apology-100-years-after-amritsar-massacre\" title=\"\">mealy-mouthed politics</a> that have so far characterised the centenary commemorations. The Amritsar massacre remains one of the most notorious acts of brutality in the history of the British empire. On 13 April 1919, colonial troops under the command of Brigadier General Reginald Dyer opened fire on a large unarmed gathering of Indian civilians at Jallianwala Bagh in order to quell what was incorrectly believed to be an imminent uprising. The shooting lasted 10 minutes, leaving between 500 and 600 people dead and at least three times as many wounded. The massacre permanently alienated most Indian nationalists, including Gandhi, who in 1920 for the first time called for outright independence from Britain. Months after the massacre, CF Andrews, a Christian priest and close friend of Gandhi, helped interview survivors and gather evidence for the independent inquiry into the events. As he described it, \u201cEach act has been in very truth an act of penance, of atonement, an act of reparation for my country.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nothing could be more damaging to the myth of British exceptionalism than having to publicly apologise for the Raj</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Back in the UK, though, opinion was bitterly divided. Conservatives rallied to Dyer\u2019s defence; Winston Churchill, who was then secretary of state for war, denounced the officer\u2019s actions while claiming the massacre was an isolated incident.

      "bodyText": "It was a remarkable sight: the archbishop of Canterbury, clad in purple, prostrating himself before the memorial to the Amritsar massacre. And his act of public penitence, on Tuesday, has once again thrust this colonial atrocity into the public limelight, 100 years after it took place. Justin Welby\u2019s heartfelt apology provided a stark contrast to the mealy-mouthed politics that have so far characterised the centenary commemorations. The Amritsar massacre remains one of the most notorious acts of brutality in the history of the British empire. On 13 April 1919, colonial troops under the command of Brigadier General Reginald Dyer opened fire on a large unarmed gathering of Indian civilians at Jallianwala Bagh in order to quell what was incorrectly believed to be an imminent uprising. The shooting lasted 10 minutes, leaving between 500 and 600 people dead and at least three times as many wounded. The massacre permanently alienated most Indian nationalists, including Gandhi, who in 1920 for the first time called for outright independence from Britain. Months after the massacre, CF Andrews, a Christian priest and close friend of Gandhi, helped interview survivors and gather evidence for the independent inquiry into the events. As he described it, \u201cEach act has been in very truth an act of penance, of atonement, an act of reparation for my country.\u201d Back in the UK, though, opinion was bitterly divided. Conservatives rallied to Dyer\u2019s defence; Winston Churchill, who was then secretary of state for war, denounced the officer\u2019s actions while claiming the massacre was an isolated incident. The colonial authorities in India later paid compensation to the relatives of the victims, yet the British government has never formally apologised for the massacre. Queen Elizabeth visited Jallianwala Bagh in 1997, followed by David Cameron in 2013; both of them studiously avoided apologising. And while Theresa May expressed \u201cdeep regret\u201d about the massacre, earlier this year, she didn\u2019t go as far as actually saying sorry. In India, the UK\u2019s failure to apologise remains deeply contentious.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve always liked men. If anything, I\u2019ve liked them too much. I was unfaithful during my first marriage, and as a single woman I had the morals of an alley cat. It\u2019s just the way I am \u2013 I don\u2019t know why. Obviously, I didn\u2019t sleep with men I found unattractive, and only once have I slept with a man for money (a very attractive married mechanic who fixed my car for free). But generally, as long as they liked me, that was a good enough reason to link up with a guy. Despite having had an active sex life, it\u2019s taken many, many years to realise that I\u2019m completely unsuited to relationships. I become very needy and insecure, and try to catch them checking other people out. I find myself setting them little domestic tests, which they always fail. I snap at the children because I\u2019m waiting for his call, and then call him myself because I can\u2019t stand the fear of rejection. In short, I\u2019m totally unreasonable \u2013 and the emotional agonies I put myself through are unreal. So now, at the age of 61, I have been happily celibate for nearly five years. I sometimes miss having cuddles, and someone to tell about my good and bad moments, but there\u2019s always Facebook for that. Overall, I like being single. I have my own money and I decide what to do with it. I go where I want on holiday and do what I want to do. Sexually, I can manage on my own, and I\u2019m even good at DIY. If it\u2019s a bigger job, I can always get a tradesman in. (Now there\u2019s a thought...) \u2022 Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours? Email sex@theguardian.com.

There is an exciting movement in African science fiction happening right now and <em>Binti</em> is the gateway drug.

Can a book be a winner and also be underrated? Prejudice knows no bounds.</p> <p><strong>The book that changed my mind</strong><br>The autobiography of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/19/malcolm-x-oxford-kill-me-soon-assassination-tariq-ali\" title=\"\">Malcolm X</a> taught me that a real hero chooses the road less travelled: popularity is no measure of integrity.</p> <p><strong>The last book that made me cry and laugh</strong><br><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/21/bantam-jackie-kay-review-home-truths-from-goddess-small-things\" title=\"\">Bantam</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/21/bantam-jackie-kay-review-home-truths-from-goddess-small-things\" title=\"\"> by Jackie Kay</a>. Her poetic salutation to her family and to Scotland moves me every time. </p> <p><strong>The book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for</strong><br>I\u2019d like to be remembered for the <em>Odyssey</em> but that was written by Homer so no chance of that. As for my books, my memoir <em>My Name Is Why</em>. It is the truth of what happened.</p> <p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><br>Sitting at a table at infant school with my finger on a drawing in a Ladybird book. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-we-love-the-ladybird-books\" title=\"\">Ladybirds</a> provided the building blocks of the written word.

The book that changed my life Every book I read changes me in one way or another. Something is created in me through reading and so I am changed. That\u2019s the beauty of reading, isn\u2019t it? There was no Catcher in the Rye or Fire Next Time moment. But then I didn\u2019t go to university. It\u2019s a different journey through books for me. The book I wish I\u2019d written Binti, a science fiction novella by Nnedi Okorafor. There is an exciting movement in African science fiction happening right now and Binti is the gateway drug. Okorafor\u2019s imagination is limitless. The book that had the greatest influence on me I read Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley by Timothy White while locked in Wood End Assessment Centre in Wigan and realised that I was catching fire myself. The book I give as a gift Aida Edemariam\u2019s The Wife\u2019s Tale. It is subversive, brilliantly researched and committed. The book that is most underrated Moon Tiger by Penelope Lively won the Booker prize in the 1980s. Can a book be a winner and also be underrated? Prejudice knows no bounds. The book that changed my mind The autobiography of Malcolm X taught me that a real hero chooses the road less travelled: popularity is no measure of integrity. The last book that made me cry and laugh Bantam by Jackie Kay. Her poetic salutation to her family and to Scotland moves me every time. The book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for I\u2019d like to be remembered for the Odyssey but that was written by Homer so no chance of that. As for my books, my memoir My Name Is Why. It is the truth of what happened. My earliest reading memory Sitting at a table at infant school with my finger on a drawing in a Ladybird book. Ladybirds provided the building blocks of the written word. And from these structures the world opened. The whole world was filled with words waiting for me. My comfort read A Life in Thirty-Five Boxes: How I Survived Selling My Record Collection by Dave Haslam. He\u2019s from my time in Manchester and was a DJ at the Hacienda. Once you have discovered him there is no going back. My guilty pleasure Lee Child\u2019s Jack Reacher series. But no more films, OK? \u2022 My Name Is Why by Lemn Sissay is published by Canongate (\u00a316.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846. Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315, online orders only. Phone orders min p&amp;p of \u00a31.99. Sissay will appear at the London Literature Festival on 18 October.",

      "body": "<p>What to do about violent youth? Violent young men that is. Their thirst for action, extremity, conflict, heroism. Their cruelty. Perhaps the army? But soldiers are expensive. There\u2019s sport of course, channelling adrenaline and competitiveness into spectacle; but few of us have the stuff of athletes.</p> <p>One idea that took off in the late 19th century was to corral rowdy men together in stadiums to support their local football teams, directing their negative energy towards the urgent rivalry of the players on the field. They might yell obscenities, invade the pitch and get into drunken brawls with opposing supporters, but with rare exceptions the mayhem was safely circumscribed; the police knew where the bad boys were; they could be frisked for weapons at the turnstiles; and their very thirst for transgression galvanised the stadium experience for everyone. Brutishness was satisfied, contained and even exploited.</p> <p>Every European country had its variation on this solution, according to its values and traditions, a morphing of local folklore in the age of commercialised sport. In postwar Italy it eventually produced the phenomenon known as the ultras, a name suggesting people who were \u201cbeyond\u201d \u2013 <em>oltre</em> \u2013 or outside normal society, purists, fundamentalists. In what sense? In their celebration of their club, their colours, their community, ultimately themselves. Italian society has historically tended to put family, corporation or region before such considerations as merit or moral probity. The ultras take that propensity to extremes. Week after week, home and away, at great expense of effort and resources, they form the core fan support behind the goal, leading chants, hanging up banners, looking for fights with opposing supporters, filling the atmosphere with wild energy. Needless to say, those fans who actively oppose them or won\u2019t come on board will very likely be intimidated. Tobias Jones seeks to offer both a history of the ultras and a feeling of what it\u2019s like to be among them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fef83224d6b5050e6a83662f7d622c5996b088bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fef83224d6b5050e6a83662f7d622c5996b088bd/0_107_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lazio\u2019s ultra clash with riot police at the end of the derby match against Roma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lazio\u2019s ultras clash with riot police at the end of the derby match against Roma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefano Montesi - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In large part his book enacts a clash of values, a fabulously extended equivocation.

He wants to celebrate the good. He is fascinated by the fact that during the 1980s, Cosenza\u2019s ultras were largely taken over by an eccentric monk, Padre Fedele, who pushed them to do charitable work, sought to bring together the country\u2019s ultras in a pact of nonviolence and with frequent appearances on Italian TV became, Jones claims, \u201ca spiritual guide to the ultras of not just Cosenza but of Italy\u201d.</p> <p>As I learned in my 10 years in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/23/sportandleisure.sport\" title=\"\">Verona </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/23/sportandleisure.sport\" title=\"\">curva</a></em> what matters for the ultras is setting themselves apart, making themselves visible.

Last month he settled a $200m civil claim brought by the liquidators of Queensland Nickel, which collapsed in 2016. Liquidators accused Palmer of using the company as a personal piggybank, and attacked transactions including the payment of millions of dollars to relatives and his personal Hong Kong bank account. They referred Palmer to Asic for possible prosecution in April 2016, telling the regulator possible offences included criminal breaches of director\u2019s duties. Price told the parliamentary committee that as part of its investigation Asic \u201cissued over 180 statutory notices in respect of information that we wanted to review\u201d. He said Asic had also reviewed more than eight terabytes of emails and interviewed Palmer, members of his family and professional advisers. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cMore recently we\u2019ve received an extra 32 terabytes of data, which we\u2019re reviewing,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Palmer\u2019s existing criminal case is due back before the courts next week. He is charged with a breach of takeovers laws resulting from an episode in 2012 where another of his companies allegedly said it would buy the Coolum resort from existing investors but then failed to offer to buy their shares within a two-month time limit set down in the Corporations Act. The charges carry a maximum penalty of two years jail or a fine of $11,000. Palmer is to appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court next Friday for a mention.",

Speaking outside the South Melbourne coroners court at the end of a three-week inquest into the 55-year-old Yorta Yorta woman\u2019s death in custody, Belinda, Warren, and Apryl Day said it was \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d that police had repeatedly said there had been no policy or procedural changes as a result of their mother\u2019s death. They are seeking an investigation into what they say amounts to criminal negligence.

The inquest heard that she had been arrested for public drunkenness and left in the cells for four hours to \u201csober up\u201d, that police had not followed their own guidelines on conducting welfare checks, and that they had not noticed her injury until more than three hours after the fall. Earlier, family members walked out of the court when a senior police officer tried to explain attempts by the police to reduce the over-incarceration of Indigenous people. Superintendent Sussan Thomas was nominated by Victoria Police to give evidence about policies and procedures as they related to Day\u2019s death, but said she was unable to comment in detail on custodial procedures, cultural awareness training, the management of the Aboriginal Community Justice Partnerships or any responses or reviews following Day\u2019s death because she was \u201cnot a subject expert\u201d. She said she thought she had been asked to come to the inquest \u201cto talk about all the good work that is occurring across Victoria Police and the policies as well\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Sean is in his early 20s, an art student, and lives with cerebral palsy. It\u2019s the cerebral palsy that gives him an \u201caccent\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s how Janet, the young woman employed to care for him, describes it. Janet has learned to distinguish \u201cbiscuits\u201d from \u201cbusiness\u201d and, as the narrator of this skilful debut novel, she translates Sean\u2019s experience for us just as she navigates the world for him. But there\u2019s an unsettling air of detachment to her own voice that allows her to describe Sean\u2019s pained body and the unlovely work of care \u2013 baby wipes, bibs, suppositories \u2013 with an unflinching precision.</p> <p>Is it really possible to provide care and feel detached? And what happens to your own life when it is put to the service of another? These are some of the difficult questions that Alex Allison compels us to consider. The answers are not easy. Finely written and thoughtfully devised, this is also a disquieting and unsettling read about the balance of power, cruelty and compassion in the relationship between a carer and their charge.</p> <p>Sean is studying at Central Saint Martins. He lives alone but requires support both at home and at college. Janet was once an art student too, but her ambitions were thwarted. Now Sean\u2019s needs command almost all of her attention: from rolling him awake and winching him upright, to propping him up in hydrotherapy classes and posing him for his art projects. He commands our attention too: a captivating figure, even as he struggles to move and speak. Over the course of the novel, it becomes clear that while Sean\u2019s condition immobilises him, it is Janet whose life is really in stasis.</p> <p>As the title suggests, <em>The Art of the Body</em> is concerned with physical experience \u2013 and for the most part, that means the repetitive cleaning, wiping, feeding, massaging and manoeuvring that Janet has to undertake on Sean\u2019s behalf. She records the bare physiological facts of his body so dispassionately that it is almost brutal: the shallow breaths that only reach \u201cthe top of his lungs\u201d, the smooth feet \u201cuntested by weight\u201d, the faeces that are \u201ccaked into his crack and hair\u201d at the end of the day. She leaves him to clean his own crotch, \u201cwhich he does with a curled stabbing motion that I can\u2019t watch\u201d. Is it the pathos of the gesture that she cannot bear? Or a repulsion that she betrays in turning away?</p> <p>Janet attends to Sean\u2019s needs but she also steals his petty cash. Every morning, she diligently takes him through a physiotherapy routine that is more arduous for her than it is for him, but at night, in the privacy of her flat, she dreams of torturing him, inflicting terrible wounds. The great merit of Allison\u2019s novel is the intelligence and clarity with which it inspects their relationship. It never threatens to lurch into tragic romance or heroic suffering; there is, instead, constant questioning and recalibration. When Sean\u2019s family life suddenly changes, the evasive Janet is forced into acknowledging her own dependence.</p> <p>Allison writes unobtrusively, setting up illuminating parallels and gently guiding the reader to unexpected understanding. Sean needs Janet in order to achieve his artistic ambitions, but it is Janet who is living vicariously through him. Janet administers Sean\u2019s physical therapy, but she is also his tormentor, exercising her will over his incapacitated body. The conditions of Sean\u2019s life mean that privacy is impossible for him \u2013 but it is Janet who finds Sean invading her private life. When her boyfriend, Jordan, reaches for a condom, the smell of latex makes her think of Sean.</p> <p>Jordan is a former champion gymnast \u2013 his athleticism contrasts with Sean\u2019s disability \u2013 and Janet\u2019s parents are undertakers, so she possesses an unusual understanding of bodies. For one of his projects, Sean has Janet pose him as the lamb of Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s 1640 painting <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/agnus-dei/795b841a-ec81-4d10-bd8b-0c7a870e327b\" title=\"\"><em>Agnus Dei</em></a>. Her surname is Lamb. Some of these devices feel laboured, but mostly this is a novel that works hard at thinking about how differently the human form can be contorted and manipulated.</p> <p>Allison has an eye for artistic affectations, nicely lampooning Sean\u2019s simpering art school teacher and an enthusiastic critic from Frieze magazine, but he allows Sean\u2019s passion for art to ring true. The book reflects both on how art can represent the body and how it makes itself felt through our bodies. Visiting Tate Modern, Sean makes Janet stare so hard at a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2019/may/18/observer-archive-bridget-riley-25-may-1969\" title=\"\"> Bridget Riley</a> painting that she grows dizzy and has to clutch his chair for support.

      "bodyText": "Sean is in his early 20s, an art student, and lives with cerebral palsy. It\u2019s the cerebral palsy that gives him an \u201caccent\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s how Janet, the young woman employed to care for him, describes it. Janet has learned to distinguish \u201cbiscuits\u201d from \u201cbusiness\u201d and, as the narrator of this skilful debut novel, she translates Sean\u2019s experience for us just as she navigates the world for him. But there\u2019s an unsettling air of detachment to her own voice that allows her to describe Sean\u2019s pained body and the unlovely work of care \u2013 baby wipes, bibs, suppositories \u2013 with an unflinching precision. Is it really possible to provide care and feel detached? And what happens to your own life when it is put to the service of another? These are some of the difficult questions that Alex Allison compels us to consider. The answers are not easy. Finely written and thoughtfully devised, this is also a disquieting and unsettling read about the balance of power, cruelty and compassion in the relationship between a carer and their charge. Sean is studying at Central Saint Martins. He lives alone but requires support both at home and at college. Janet was once an art student too, but her ambitions were thwarted. Now Sean\u2019s needs command almost all of her attention: from rolling him awake and winching him upright, to propping him up in hydrotherapy classes and posing him for his art projects. He commands our attention too: a captivating figure, even as he struggles to move and speak. Over the course of the novel, it becomes clear that while Sean\u2019s condition immobilises him, it is Janet whose life is really in stasis. As the title suggests, The Art of the Body is concerned with physical experience \u2013 and for the most part, that means the repetitive cleaning, wiping, feeding, massaging and manoeuvring that Janet has to undertake on Sean\u2019s behalf. She records the bare physiological facts of his body so dispassionately that it is almost brutal: the shallow breaths that only reach \u201cthe top of his lungs\u201d, the smooth feet \u201cuntested by weight\u201d, the faeces that are \u201ccaked into his crack and hair\u201d at the end of the day. She leaves him to clean his own crotch, \u201cwhich he does with a curled stabbing motion that I can\u2019t watch\u201d. Is it the pathos of the gesture that she cannot bear? Or a repulsion that she betrays in turning away? Janet attends to Sean\u2019s needs but she also steals his petty cash. Every morning, she diligently takes him through a physiotherapy routine that is more arduous for her than it is for him, but at night, in the privacy of her flat, she dreams of torturing him, inflicting terrible wounds. The great merit of Allison\u2019s novel is the intelligence and clarity with which it inspects their relationship. It never threatens to lurch into tragic romance or heroic suffering; there is, instead, constant questioning and recalibration. When Sean\u2019s family life suddenly changes, the evasive Janet is forced into acknowledging her own dependence. Allison writes unobtrusively, setting up illuminating parallels and gently guiding the reader to unexpected understanding. Sean needs Janet in order to achieve his artistic ambitions, but it is Janet who is living vicariously through him. Janet administers Sean\u2019s physical therapy, but she is also his tormentor, exercising her will over his incapacitated body. The conditions of Sean\u2019s life mean that privacy is impossible for him \u2013 but it is Janet who finds Sean invading her private life. When her boyfriend, Jordan, reaches for a condom, the smell of latex makes her think of Sean. Jordan is a former champion gymnast \u2013 his athleticism contrasts with Sean\u2019s disability \u2013 and Janet\u2019s parents are undertakers, so she possesses an unusual understanding of bodies. For one of his projects, Sean has Janet pose him as the lamb of Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s 1640 painting Agnus Dei. Her surname is Lamb. Some of these devices feel laboured, but mostly this is a novel that works hard at thinking about how differently the human form can be contorted and manipulated. Allison has an eye for artistic affectations, nicely lampooning Sean\u2019s simpering art school teacher and an enthusiastic critic from Frieze magazine, but he allows Sean\u2019s passion for art to ring true. The book reflects both on how art can represent the body and how it makes itself felt through our bodies. Visiting Tate Modern, Sean makes Janet stare so hard at a Bridget Riley painting that she grows dizzy and has to clutch his chair for support.

Having covered the doings of the Crawleys up to 1925, the film moves on by a couple of years, with King George and Queen Mary due to visit the house. The cast, including Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville, are all present and correct.</p> <h2>Hustlers (15)</h2> <p><em>(Lorene Scafaria, 2019, US) 110 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-PDzl4iRtM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X-PDzl4iRtM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Jennifer Lopez is back in this rousingly trashy riposte to The Wolf of Wall Street.

The Greek Passion is based upon Nikos Kazantzakis\u2019s novel Christ Recrucified, in which the arrival of a group of refugees splits a village community. The new production is directed by Christopher Alden and conducted by Garry Walker, Opera North\u2019s new music director, with Nicky Spence, Magdalena Molendowska and Paul Nilon.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.operanorth.co.uk/whats-on/the-greek-passion/#book\">Grand Theatre, Leeds, Saturday 14 September to 19 October; touring to 16 November</a></em></p> <h2>\u00c9clairs Sur L\u2019Au-Del\u00e0</h2> <p>The centrepiece of the London Symphony Orchestra\u2019s season-opening concerts with Simon Rattle is Olivier Messiaen\u2019s final completed score. First performed in 1992, \u00c9clairs Sur L\u2019Au-Del\u00e0 (Illuminations of the Beyond) draws on imagery from the Book of Revelation, as well as ideas from cosmology and, as always with Messiaen, affirmations of his Roman Catholic faith.

There\u2019s a folkloric touch of magic and perhaps a hint of Wicker Man paganism to his art.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.ikon-gallery.org/event/barry-flanagan/?gclid=CjwKCAjwtuLrBRAlEiwAPVcZBuRDXbS0lcg4NF4PzuiTCLIxv9kf60ytvSkxT9gNG-TtHTLXxRRqEhoCzwIQAvD_BwE\">Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, Wednesday 18 September to 24 November</a></em></p> <h2>Life Through Extraordinary Mirrors</h2> <p>Eddy Kamuanga Ilunga\u2019s paintings explore the traumatic history and divided psyche of the Democratic Republic of Congo through figures who wear traditional fabrics over cyborg bodies.

Picasso is \u201cthe designer\u201d, while Henri Matisse communicates through colour. But as this show of his etchings confirms, Matisse could create beauty just as definitively in black and white as blue or red. He defines images in the sparest of drawings, creating with art\u2019s purest element: the line.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.holburne.org/events/matisse-master-of-line/\">The Holburne Museum, Bath, Wednesday 18 September to 5 January</a></em></p> <h2>1819</h2> <p>JMW Turner\u2019s painting England: Richmond Hill, on the Prince Regent\u2019s Birthday is one of his most rhapsodic hymns to nature \u2013 and nation.

Cattelan\u2019s renowned sculpture of the pope struck by a meteorite is perfectly designed for some marble palace while his gold toilet is nothing if not luxurious. So Blenheim, the extravagant, architecturally thrilling palace built in the 18th century, is a perfect stage for his gags.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.blenheimartfoundation.org.uk/exhibitions/maurizio-cattelan/\">Blenheim Palace, Woodstock, to 27 October</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"718818d373cdf9c9c862238aed29f289df6827eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/718818d373cdf9c9c862238aed29f289df6827eb/157_0_1667_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zo\u00eb Wanamaker and Zrinka Cvite\u0161i\u0107.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Political stage...

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films Downton Abbey (PG) (Michael Engler, 2019, UK) 122 mins Inspired by country-house murder mystery Gosford Park, TV\u2019s Downton Abbey has returned the favour to the big screen by cranking out its own adaptation. Having covered the doings of the Crawleys up to 1925, the film moves on by a couple of years, with King George and Queen Mary due to visit the house. The cast, including Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville, are all present and correct. Hustlers (15) (Lorene Scafaria, 2019, US) 110 mins Jennifer Lopez is back in this rousingly trashy riposte to The Wolf of Wall Street. Here it\u2019s the pole- and lap-dancers who are putting one over on their besuited, hair-gelled male clients, market-playing mugs who end up drugged and their credit cards repurposed. Constance Wu puts in a solid show alongside Lopez, with Cardi B along for the ride. The Souvenir (15) (Joanna Hogg, 2019, UK/US) 120 mins Joanna Hogg confirms her status as one of the UK\u2019s leading auteurs with this study of an uncertain film student, set in the late 80s. Tilda Swinton\u2019s daughter Honor Swinton Byrne plays Julie, struggling to articulate herself as an artist and undermined by a new relationship with Foreign Office pen-pusher Tom Burke. Hogg\u2019s ability to strain meaning and dramatic tension from apparent minutiae is fully in evidence. For Sama (18) (Waad al-Kateab, Edward Watts, 2019, UK) 100 mins Harrowing documentary shot from inside the siege of Aleppo, co-directed by Syrian mother Waad al-Kateab and framed as a testimony to her newborn daughter Sama. While the brutalities of bombing and assault are ever-present, this is primarily a human document, concerned to convey the cost of conflict in an emotional rather than political way. Midnight Cowboy (18) (John Schlesinger, 1969, US) 111 mins A reissue of the landmark Hollywood new wave film, the first X-rated film to win the best picture Oscar. Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are the street hustlers trying to make a buck and finding in each other a strange sort of familial companionship. Funny, desperate and tragic by turns, it\u2019s lost none of its power. AP Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Khalid It has been a pretty big year for 21-year-old R&amp;B pop practitioner Khalid. His second album, Free Spirit, topped the US charts, he scored a massive hit with the Disclosure-assisted Talk, and Ed Sheeran roped him into his collaborations project thing, resulting in a UK No 1 with Beautiful People. This arena tour feels like a big fat cherry on top. The O2, SE10, Tuesday 17 &amp; Wednesday 18; The SSE Hydro, Glasgow, Friday 20; touring to 25 September BBC Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park Last year, Radio 2 managed to melt every fortysomething\u2019s heart by reuniting Kylie and Jason for a live rendition of Especially for You, so fingers crossed it can pull off a similar nostalgia payload this time around. The singalong-heavy lineup features classical-dance boffins Clean Bandit, stool botherers Westlife and the ever triumphant Pet Shop Boys. Hyde Park, W2, Sunday 15 September Carlie Hanson The story goes that while working in a Wisconsin branch of McDonald\u2019s, 19-year-old Hanson saw a competition to win tickets to see Zayn. Keen to show her stan card, she promptly went out to the car park and recorded a cover of his hit Pillowtalk. The Instagram clip went viral, she got signed and the rest, as they say, is history. Her recent debut EP, Junk, builds on her penchant for hyper-emotional pop. The Camden Assembly, NW1, Tuesday 17 September O\u2019Flynn Ben Norris, AKA O\u2019Flynn, makes the kind of dreamy, head-spinning electronic music typically associated with Four Tet. In fact, along with James Blake, Kieran Hebden is quite the fan, dropping Norris\u2019s percussive Tyrion during one of his Boiler Room sets. As his genre-splicing debut album Aletheia proves, however, there is more to him than some famous fans. Moles, Bath, Monday 16; Hidden, Manchester, Friday 20 September MC OneFest Maisha, the young idiom-bending collective featuring powerful saxophonist Nubya Garcia, join northern sax guru Nat Birchall, guitarist Dave Okumu and world-jazz trumpeter Byron Wallen on OneFest\u2019s innovative programme of workshops, talks and live music, curated by Sons of Kemet sax star Shabaka Hutchings. The gig is repeated on 21 September at Hackney\u2019s EartH. The Leadmill, Sheffield, Saturday 14 September JF Three of the best ... classical concerts The Greek Passion Two of Bohuslav Martin\u016f\u2019s 14 operas rank among the finest composed in the 20th century. Opera North first staged one of those masterpieces, Julietta, more than 20 years ago and now it is presenting the other. The Greek Passion is based upon Nikos Kazantzakis\u2019s novel Christ Recrucified, in which the arrival of a group of refugees splits a village community. The new production is directed by Christopher Alden and conducted by Garry Walker, Opera North\u2019s new music director, with Nicky Spence, Magdalena Molendowska and Paul Nilon. Grand Theatre, Leeds, Saturday 14 September to 19 October; touring to 16 November \u00c9clairs Sur L\u2019Au-Del\u00e0 The centrepiece of the London Symphony Orchestra\u2019s season-opening concerts with Simon Rattle is Olivier Messiaen\u2019s final completed score. First performed in 1992, \u00c9clairs Sur L\u2019Au-Del\u00e0 (Illuminations of the Beyond) draws on imagery from the Book of Revelation, as well as ideas from cosmology and, as always with Messiaen, affirmations of his Roman Catholic faith. The 11 movements are scored for an orchestra of more than 120 players, who are used with great economy. Barbican Hall, EC2, Sunday 15 September Prometheus Symphony Over the last three years, the Lammermuir festival has commissioned a triptych of works from Stuart MacRae around the myth of Prometheus. After a piano trio and a work for tenor and ensemble, MacRae now completes his series with Prometheus Symphony. Jennifer France is the soprano soloist, with Matthew Halls conducting the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.

People gather like sun worshippers revering the blue and gold sky reflected in the Thames. It\u2019s included here in an exhibition that looks back at the year of the Peterloo massacre.

      "body": "<p>Back to Black came out of nowhere \u2013 in a sense. Of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse\" title=\"\">Amy Winehouse</a> had already released her debut album, 2003\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/oct/17/jazz.shopping1\" title=\"\">Frank</a>, but, her voice aside, it sounded more or less like the work of a different artist. Frank was part of a wave of jazz-influenced MOR albums that hit big in the early 2000s. A little braver and moodier than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/apr/13/popandrock1\" title=\"\">Michael Parkinson-approved</a> likes of Jamie Cullum, Katie Melua or Michael Bubl\u00e9, but not so different from Norah Jones or any of the artists that followed in the wake of her 27m-selling album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/jan/18/popandrock1\" title=\"\">Come Away With Me</a>: a bit of jazz, a bit of neo-soul, a touch of hip-hop about the beats.</p> <p>The songs on Frank were buffed up by professional writers-for-hire; the woman who sang them signed to 19 Management by Simon Fuller, manager of the Spice Girls and mastermind behind Pop Idol and its umpteen spin-offs. It was advertised in the pages of Living Etc, as if the aural equivalent of soft furnishings, something tasteful and unobtrusive with which to embellish your living room. Winehouse hated it, or so she kept telling interviewers. \u201cI don\u2019t have it in my house,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/feb/01/popandrock.amywinehouse\" title=\"\">she informed the Guardian a few months after its release</a>.

      "bodyText": "Back to Black came out of nowhere \u2013 in a sense. Of course, Amy Winehouse had already released her debut album, 2003\u2019s Frank, but, her voice aside, it sounded more or less like the work of a different artist. Frank was part of a wave of jazz-influenced MOR albums that hit big in the early 2000s. A little braver and moodier than the Michael Parkinson-approved likes of Jamie Cullum, Katie Melua or Michael Bubl\u00e9, but not so different from Norah Jones or any of the artists that followed in the wake of her 27m-selling album Come Away With Me: a bit of jazz, a bit of neo-soul, a touch of hip-hop about the beats. The songs on Frank were buffed up by professional writers-for-hire; the woman who sang them signed to 19 Management by Simon Fuller, manager of the Spice Girls and mastermind behind Pop Idol and its umpteen spin-offs. It was advertised in the pages of Living Etc, as if the aural equivalent of soft furnishings, something tasteful and unobtrusive with which to embellish your living room. Winehouse hated it, or so she kept telling interviewers. \u201cI don\u2019t have it in my house,\u201d she informed the Guardian a few months after its release. The best she could manage by way of talking it up was to grudgingly suggest \u201cit isn\u2019t shit\u201d. Certainly, it could not prepare the listener for Back to Black: nothing about Frank suggested that its creator was going to make a genuinely epochal masterpiece. Something had happened to Amy Winehouse in the three years that separated her second album from her debut: skinny, covered in tattoos, dressed like a cartoon of a 60s girl-group member \u2013 complete with a vertiginous beehive modelled on that of the Ronettes\u2019 Ronnie Spector \u2013 she was almost unrecognisable. The lyrics of its lead single suggested that whatever had happened wasn\u2019t good \u2013 no one pleads with you to go to rehab if your life is in perfect shape \u2013 but the music was so ebullient you could easily overlook that. Her sound had changed as dramatically as her appearance: with Frank\u2019s producer Salaam Remi joined by Mark Ronson, then a virtual unknown, Back to Black offered an update of 60s soul and girl-group pop. Characteristically self-effacing, Ronson has suggested that his primary contribution to the album was keeping Winehouse out of the pub, but in reality his decision to relocate the recording sessions to Brooklyn\u2019s analogue Daptone studios and employ its house band, the Dap-Kings, was a masterstroke. The Dap-Kings had already spent a decade honing their retro soul style, first backing obscure deep funk singer Lee Fields, then Fields\u2019s former backing vocalist Sharon Jones. They gave the album\u2019s sound a toughness and grit that is usually missing when contemporary producers ape the 60s output of Muscle Shoals and Hitsville USA. The sound chafed against the lyrics\u2019 plethora of 21st-century references and hip-hop-influenced intonation (\u201cI\u2019ll check him at the door / Make sure he got green / I\u2019m tighter than airport security teama\u201d), and against Winehouse\u2019s Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday-influenced vocals. The tension between musical styles was infinitely more gripping than Frank\u2019s clumsy attempts to highlight Winehouse\u2019s jazz chops through scat singing and decorating tracks with samples of crackling vinyl. Moreover, it didn\u2019t sound like a knowing pastiche, largely because Winehouse had dispensed with the hired songwriting help and written a set of songs that were strong enough to bear comparison to those she had been influenced by.

Nearly 15 years on, you still can\u2019t move for twentysomething men who sound like ravaged blues shouters and twentysomething women trying their best to channel Billie Holiday. And Back to Black ushered in a new vogue for soul-baring albums rooted in the artist\u2019s lives: an updated version of the early 70s trend for confessional singer-songwriters, rebooted for the age of social media, with its oversharing late-night posts and belief that rock and pop artists should be #relatable (Facebook opened to everyone over 13 with a valid email address four weeks before Back to Black\u2019s release; Twitter\u2019s tipping point came five months later).

The band\u2019s biggest hit set the template for Elephant: brooding moods, measured out in eighths by Meg White, would tip over into cathartic squalls of blues rock. Jack White\u2019s much-lampooned fetish for analogue production is legitimate \u2013 you can almost feel the breeze from the amps on your face as the riffs strut out \u2013 and he squeezed more tone out of the electric guitar than almost anyone else that decade. <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4bud6XY9UtafCOiYzv2vOl\">Listen to the album</a>.</em></p> <h2>47 <strong>Sleater-Kinney</strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/may/20/popandrock.shopping11\"><br>The Woods (2005)</a></h2> <p>The trio had always sounded \u2013 appealingly \u2013 like a band rehearsing in a garage, but here they threatened to blow its door open and its walls apart.

Tracks such as Kill V Maim were made for the balls of your feet, full of the chillingly cutesy pep of east Asian pop, but the best tracks were the robo-funky World Princess Part II and the demo version of Realiti: the sound of speeding through a city, its sounds muffled inside a luxury sedan. <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/5hB4jVN4ZHpubyiMmW81K1\">Listen to the album</a>.</em></p> <h2>45 <strong>Portishead</strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/25/electronicmusic.popandrock\"><br>Third (2008)</a></h2> <p>Released more than 10 years since their pair of trip-hop-defining albums, Third proved the west country trio still had it \u2013 it being their particular mood of bruised, bloodied tenacity in a world that wasn\u2019t just uncaring, but actively violent.

The production is all sleazy, buzzing electro, and Britney\u2019s melodies have the twisted naivety of nursery rhymes.

The influence of this and his 2006 debut cannot be overstated, feeding into the dub songcraft of the xx and James Blake, as well as an entire generation of ambient producers.

There is another side here, too: chatty, puckish and getting over it all. The anchor of the album \u2013 initially released in a trailblazing three parts across 2010 \u2013 was Dancing on My Own, a breakup song with a wildly transgressive edge: is there a secret erotic thrill behind the pain of going to the club to watch her partner with their new girlfriend? <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0le9TO3kU69m6iWHTjNs9Y\">Listen to the album</a>.</em></p> <h2>14 <strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/01/kendrick-lamar-good-kid-review\">good kid, m.A.A.d. city</a> (2012)</h2> <p>The breakthrough moment for rap\u2019s greatest ever talent.

      "bodyText": "100 Fiona Apple The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do (2012) Seven years after her previous album, Apple\u2019s return sidelined her orchestral trademarks for an austere, homespun sound that exposed her insular lyrics even more starkly. Listen to the album. 99 Rihanna Anti- (2016) The first album album from an artist whose records had previously propped up killer singles with passable fillers turned her disaffection and disappointment into generational anthems. Listen to the album. 98 Rokia Traor\u00e9 Tchamantch\u00e9 (2008) The Malian guitarist set a new career benchmark with this intimate set, adding classical western harp and African ngoni to her subtle, bluesy electric guitar. Listen to the album. 97 R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy Ruby Blue (2005) Trip-hop duo Moloko was dead, and Murphy teamed up with Matthew Herbert for this eclectic, saucy \u2013 and still underrated \u2013 pop record that anticipated the arrival of Lady Gaga by three years. Listen to the album. 96 Missy Elliott Miss E \u2026 So Addictive (2001) Drawing from house, psychedelia and even Bollywood soundtracks, Missy\u2019s third \u2013 the one responsible for Get Ur Freak On \u2013 forced pop to catch up with her yet again. Listen to the album. 95 Charli XCX Pop 2 (2017) XCX stopped waiting around for mainstream acceptance and showed the normies what they were missing with this bracingly eclectic, guest-laden mixtape. Listen to the album. 94 Peaches The Teaches of Peaches (2000) Merrill Nisker grafted sweaty, human filth on to the clean machine shock of electroclash on her hilarious, titillating debut as Peaches. Listen to the album. 93 Low Things We Lost in the Fire (2001) Filled with crushing, funereal dirges and a song about wanting to encase a newborn baby in metal to prevent its growth, the Duluth group\u2019s fifth album was nonetheless inexplicably beautiful. Listen to the album. 92 Erykah Badu New Amerykah Part One (4th World War) (2008) Part state-of-the-nation opus, part eye-opening trawl through the unexplored depths of Badu\u2019s brain. Listen to the album. 91 Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 and Toumani Diabat\u00e9 In the Heart of the Moon (2005) Two Malian greats met for this soothing, spontaneous record of guitar and kora that is as subtly textured as it is generous. Listen to the album. 90 Katy B On a Mission (2011) No disposable vocalist or featured artist, the charismatic, club-savvy south Londoner gave dubstep its first real star. Listen to the album. 89 Taylor Swift 1989 (2014) Swift\u2019s first \u201cofficially documented pop album\u201d saw her shake off any remaining country trappings to become a gleaming synthpop behemoth. Listen to the album. 88 Fleet Foxes Fleet Foxes (2008) The Seattle group\u2019s debut heralded a generation\u2019s post-recession retreat into rural comforts, conjuring a pastoral idyll from the best of west coast folk and British traditionalism. Listen to the album. 87 Justin Timberlake Justified (2002) The finest boyband breakout since Robbie Williams\u2019s Life Thru a Lens, and that\u2019s not damning with faint praise: Timberlake\u2019s Neptunes/Timbaland-helmed debut was slick, sexy and most importantly, convincing. Listen to the album. 86 Elliott Smith Figure 8 (2000) Smith\u2019s final album followed his brief adoption by Hollywood, and added a cinematic grandeur to his work \u2013 but, thankfully, it didn\u2019t swamp his haunted songwriting. Listen to the album. 85 Chromatics Kill for Love (2012) The album that ushered in the moody, neon-lit synthpop that would define the rest of the decade, Ruth Radelet playing Nico to Johnny Jewel\u2019s Velvet Underground-worthy cool. Listen to the album. 84 Konono No 1 Congotronics (2004) Twenty-five years after forming, the Congolese group made their name with this rhythmic explosion of likembes (thumb pianos) put through junkyard amplification. Listen to the album. 83 Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds Skeleton Tree (2016) Written before the death of one of Cave\u2019s teenage sons \u2013 not after it, as was often assumed \u2013 Skeleton Tree nonetheless cast Cave\u2019s recurring themes in unsettlingly anaesthetised new light. Listen to the album. 82 Yo La Tengo And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out (2000) The album that every hushed, autumnal indie record aspires to be, a cocoon of disaffection. Listen to the album. 81 Madvillain Madvillainy (2004) Madlib and MF Doom combined for an album that rattled with enough innovation and enough bars to prop up 10 records. Listen to the album. 80 Lady Gaga The Fame (2008) The provocative pop debut that made pastiche into an art form and revelled in the artifice and ambition of fame. Listen to the album. 79 Kanye West Late Registration (2005) West justified his arrogance by setting it alongside sharp political commentary (at a time when few of his peers were speaking up) and fiercely arresting production. Listen to the album. 78 Drake Take Care (2011) Despite an outstanding lineup of guests and producers, all eyes were on Drake\u2019s journey into and out of heartbreak, variously bitter, angry and doe-eyed. Listen to the album. 77 The Bug London Zoo (2008) Kevin Martin\u2019s discordant and seductive second, voicing his discontent via an array of guest MCs. Listen to the album. 76 Wild Beasts Two Dancers (2009) Wild Beasts were a sad casualty of the last decade, but Two Dancers found the Cumbrian lads at their prime, bringing Chaucerian ribaldry to football terrace hooks. Listen to the album. 75 MIA Kala (2007) A multicultural celebration, a political statement and a middle finger up to misogynists. Listen to the album. 74 Salif Keita Moffou (2002) The Malian artist made his best album at the age of 53, his playing and duets with female singers conveying a sense of spontaneity that belied his deep craft. Listen to the album. 73 Clipse Hell Hath No Fury (2007) A biting subversion of the era\u2019s cocaine rap, evident in the despairing lyrics and magnetically ruined textures. Listen to the album. 72 Lily Allen Alright, Still (2006) The voice of a generation: pissed, pissed off and funny, Allen\u2019s debut brought a welcome reality check to a sheeny era of pop. Listen to the album. 71 John Grant Queen of Denmark (2010) Midlake backed the former Czars frontman on this remarkable return to form following a period of heartbreak, addiction and depression. Listen to the album. 70 Lana Del Rey Born to Die (2012) Thought shaky at the time, her controversial debut \u2013 the one responsible for Video Games \u2013 has since acquired cult status. Listen to the album. 69 Vampire Weekend Vampire Weekend (2008) Single A-Punk masked a hugely diverse album: a strange yet winning mix of flutes, strings and Afrobeat. Listen to the album. 68 The National Boxer (2007) The moment they made the transition from white-collar worriers to rarefied indie giants: the elegiac Boxer is as much of a New York totem as Is This It or Interpol\u2019s debut. Listen to the album. 67 Eminem The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) Eminem\u2019s third album has dated horribly with its homophobia and gleeful suggestion of violence against women, but in other parts of the album the incisiveness with which he unspools his misanthropic take on life remains transgressively vital. Listen to the album. 66 Alicia Keys Songs in A Minor (2001) Pristine neo-soul played by an old soul in a 19-year-old\u2019s body. On her debut, Keys was a traditionalist steeped in pedigree, but not so schooled that it stifled her vulnerability. Listen to the album. 65 Primal Scream XTRMNTR (2000) Loaded, but only in the sense that XTRMNTR suggested heavy artillery locked and ready to fire: few good times here. Listen to the album. 64 Kelis Tasty (2003) Lascivious, soulful and compellingly weird, Kelis was ahead of her time \u2013 though it\u2019s still thrilling to remember that the extremely unsubtle Milkshake was a No 2 hit. Listen to the album. 63 Jay-Z The Black Album (2003) Supposedly Jay-Z\u2019s last album before a retirement that never arrived, The Black Album was the apotheosis of the rapper\u2019s self-mythologising, establishing him as an old-school classicist and innovator. Listen to the album. 62 The Knife Silent Shout (2006) Gothic and abrasive in equal parts, the Swedish brother-sister duo\u2019s third album offered ceaseless electronic invention at a time when their synth-minded peers were content to till their way through music history\u2019s trash. Listen to the album. 61 Kanye West The College Dropout (2004) Infectious ego, unknockable confidence and hysterical commentary: a relic from lighter days that did not foresee West\u2019s extraordinary evolution. Listen to the album. 60 Jens Lekman Night Falls Over Kortedala (2007) Matching Jonathan Richman for wry, detail-heavy storytelling and Sufjan Stevens for orchestral whimsy, Lekman elevated romantic mishaps in his Gothenburg home town to cinematic proportions. Listen to the album. 59 Janelle Mon\u00e1e The ArchAndroid (2010) A bracing introduction to an uncontainable ambition: Mon\u00e1e\u2019s intergalactic debut proper straddled James Brown funk, pastoral whimsy and indie quirk, and later albums proved this was barely a fraction of her talents. Listen to the album. 58 J Dilla Donuts (2006) This masterpiece in turning samples and meticulous tinkering into an era-defining production statement was released the week of the rapper\u2019s death. Listen to the album. 57 Amy Winehouse Frank (2003) Winehouse at her most innocent \u2013 if you could ever call her that, given the cheekiness of songs like Fuck Me Pumps. Listen to the album. 56 Cannibal Ox The Cold Vein (2001) Mixing chilling realism with devastating metaphor, Vordul Mega and Vast Aire painted a grim, dystopian vision of their native New York City. Listen to the album. 55 St Vincent Strange Mercy (2011) Sex, sedition and Marilyn Monroe reveries fuelled Annie Clark\u2019s third album, which slipped serrated blades through the barbiturate wooze. Listen to the album. 54 The War on Drugs Lost in the Dream (2014) The Springsteen comparisons were fair: not since the Boss had music sounded so good driving along an empty highway. Listen to the album. 53 St Vincent St Vincent (2014) Whether shaking your ass to Digital Witness or drifting off with Prince Johnny, you did so under a constant cloudburst of ideas. Listen to the album. 52 NERD In Search of\u2026 (2001) Pharrell at his horniest ever \u2013 Truth or Dare hints at an orgy before Tape You records the sounds of one \u2013 but Bobby James is one of his loveliest ballads. Listen to the album. 51 The Microphones The Glow Pt 2 (2001) Overlapping acoustic guitars blend like plumes of smoke, and inspired snatches of melody flit by \u2013 but bursts of noise and distortion herald danger deep in the woods. Listen to the album. 50 Interpol Turn on the Bright Lights (2002) Theirs was the New York of Taxi Driver or Midnight Cowboy: fraught with rain and danger, energy crackling like the wires of a vandalised phone box. Like their peers the Strokes, the quartet made rhythm guitar the lead and foregrounded the bass, but cast them in sombre black suits rather than artfully distressed denim. Their ballad NYC became an unofficial civic anthem, synthesising the mix of sorrow and tenacity that defined the city in the wake of 9/11. Listen to the album. 49 D\u2019Angelo Black Messiah (2014) After D\u2019Angelo\u2019s years in the wilderness, struggling with addiction and indirection, many thought he was finished. He not only came back, but did so with one of the most incendiary soul records in decades. The funk deepened \u2013 the way Prayer smears its on-beat is astonishing \u2013 along with his social conscience on The Charade, though the bedroom door still beckoned constantly. Listen to the album. 48 The White Stripes Elephant (2003) It\u2019s now impossible to imagine a world without Seven Nation Army, chanted from football terraces to political rallies. The band\u2019s biggest hit set the template for Elephant: brooding moods, measured out in eighths by Meg White, would tip over into cathartic squalls of blues rock. Jack White\u2019s much-lampooned fetish for analogue production is legitimate \u2013 you can almost feel the breeze from the amps on your face as the riffs strut out \u2013 and he squeezed more tone out of the electric guitar than almost anyone else that decade. Listen to the album. 47 Sleater-Kinney The Woods (2005) The trio had always sounded \u2013 appealingly \u2013 like a band rehearsing in a garage, but here they threatened to blow its door open and its walls apart. Like a superhero who doesn\u2019t realise their own strength, everything hits too hard, burning the edges of the guitars and drums with fuzz. Their most ferocious album, then, though the wry and bitter ballad Modern Girl uses the distortion to prettier ends. Listen to the album. 46 Grimes Art Angels (2015) A massive leap in ambition as the synthpop of Visions was pulled into HD, driven up a gear and transformed into pop-punk as thrillingly fast and trashy as a Nascar race. Tracks such as Kill V Maim were made for the balls of your feet, full of the chillingly cutesy pep of east Asian pop, but the best tracks were the robo-funky World Princess Part II and the demo version of Realiti: the sound of speeding through a city, its sounds muffled inside a luxury sedan. Listen to the album. 45 Portishead Third (2008) Released more than 10 years since their pair of trip-hop-defining albums, Third proved the west country trio still had it \u2013 it being their particular mood of bruised, bloodied tenacity in a world that wasn\u2019t just uncaring, but actively violent. While they tease out the Morricone influence all the more, the highs are all their own \u2013 krautrock nightmare We Carry On; cyberpunk masterwork Machine Gun \u2013 on a record that has become one of the most influential of its era. Listen to the album. 44 Vampire Weekend Modern Vampires of the City (2013) A relatively bummer record as the polo-shirted princes of prep entered an early midlife crisis: \u201cWisdom\u2019s a gift but you\u2019d trade it for youth,\u201d Ezra Koenig sings at one point. But that wisdom, an upgrade from the mere cleverness of their earlier work, led to their most rounded songwriting yet, still gassed up with the fizz of old. Listen to the album. 43 Kendrick Lamar Damn (2017) More accessible but no less skilful or hard-hitting than its predecessors, Damn rightly became the first non jazz or classical album to win the Pulitzer prize for music. Kendrick\u2019s brilliance is to swoop between scales \u2013 nations, communities and individuals \u2013 to create a truly rounded portrait of contemporary love and politics, and the sheer lip-smacking perfection of his flow on Humble made it his biggest track yet. Listen to the album. 42 At the Drive-In Relationship of Command (2000) A band working in perfect equilibrium, where wild prog and bug-eyed Burroughs-esque visions were tethered by earthy punk. The cracked poetry (\u201cJigsaw pattern dominoes left a trail / The whites of their eyes / Polaroids of the tale\u201d) was chewed up and then spat out for moshpit soundbites (\u201cCut away!\u201d, \u201cIs it heavier than air?\u201d), between see-sawing riffs and bursts of pure noise. Listen to the album. 41 Frank Ocean Nostalgia, Ultra (2011) That Frank Ocean appears three times in this list is testament to his universal appeal \u2013 this mixtape debut opened with a Coldplay cover, and Radiohead, the Eagles and even a sample of Nicole Kidman crop up, too. Released by the Odd Future collective, he and they have done so much in the last decade to break rap and R&amp;B out of tired, restrictive genre considerations. Listen to the album. 40 Antony and the Johnsons I Am a Bird Now (2005) With its profile raised by a Mercury prize win, this album was the first time many people had encountered Anohni\u2019s voice, which didn\u2019t so much apply vibrato as become it: a beautiful instrument that instantly entranced. She would go on to embrace electronic pop that confronted the violence \u2013 environmental, martial or otherwise \u2013 of the anthropocene age. Listen to the album. 39 Britney Spears Blackout (2007) Made amid her most troubled phase, Blackout defied the odds to become a diamond pressed from trash. The production is all sleazy, buzzing electro, and Britney\u2019s melodies have the twisted naivety of nursery rhymes. The two big singles are genius: Piece of Me bats back tabloid gossip with a sonic golf club, and Gimme More is her best-ever song, an erotic psychodrama where the purring come-ons of the title also sound like a woman drowning under her ambition. Listen to the album. 38 Yeah Yeah Yeahs Fever to Tell (2003) For all the hype, the Brooklyn scene of the early 00s didn\u2019t produce many genuine rock stars, but Karen O was its finest. On the group\u2019s debut, she could electrify her withering bluesy scorn with a single yelp, and suddenly she\u2019d be a banshee screaming round the rafters; meanwhile the song Maps was pure vulnerability. Yeah Yeah Yeahs is not just O\u2019s show: like Jack White, the other great guitarist of those years, Nick Zinner could make his axe into bass and lead at all once, and drummer Brian Chase pits tub-thumping toms against seething hi-hats. Listen to the album. 37 Sufjan Stevens Carrie &amp; Lowell (2015) After bulging baroque creations The Age of Adz and The BQE, Stevens pared everything back to soft electronics and fingerpicking for this moving rumination on his stepfather and late mother. He stumbles, numb, through his own poetry, pondering suicide, gaining existential clarity and \u2013 crucially \u2013 finding beauty: \u201cThe breakers in the bar / The neighbour\u2019s greeting.\u201d Listen to the album. 36 Grimes Visions (2012) Tiny, lisping and with a high-pitched voice, Grimes weathered plenty of sexism with her breakthrough \u2013 but converted even indie snobs with her take on rave, Italo and industrial synthpop. The electro bass lines are the album\u2019s signature, lurching from the deep, but it is her vocals that make it: a shapeshifting chorus of chattering gothic cheerleaders, solemn choristers and trance divas. Listen to the album. 35 Daft Punk Discovery (2001) After keeping their heads down for their brilliant 1997 debut, letting Spike Jonze videos do the talking, Daft Punk revealed themselves \u2013 sort of. The duo were obscured behind robot heads, and their music got equally playful: cock-rock guitars, vocoders and brilliantly manipulated slivers of records by ELO, Tavares and Eddie Johns condensed into tinny yet heavy filter-house. Listen to the album. 34 The Avalanches Since I Left You (2000) It has the air of a piece of obsessional outsider art: 3,500 samples stitched together into a dense tapestry of goofy hip-hop and lounge pop. Miraculously, it makes a virtue of its maximalism: the title track thick with jasmine and tropical heat, Electricity jumping out of the speakers like a jack in the box. Listen to the album. 33 Bon Iver For Emma, Forever Ago (2007) The backstory is almost a parody of a certain kind of earnest dude: retreating to the woods with just a guitar to get over a breakup and sort out his crappy life. But after listening to the songs he came back down the hill with, the story becomes gilded and mythic: lightly fleshed out with vocal harmonies and drums, they are sensationally beautiful. Listen to the album. 32 MIA Arular (2005) MIA frequently showed just how conservative the US is by doing ordinary things \u2013 rapping while pregnant, sticking her middle finger up \u2013 that nevertheless had people reaching for the smelling salts. It all began with her debut collection of blown-out rap and dancehall, stitched together with samples from a trolley dash down the unregulated internet \u2013 a harbinger of our cosmopolitan post-genre age. Listen to the album. 31 Burial Untrue (2007) The ghosts of London raves gone by are conjured by this ouija board of a record, where garage vocals flit upward past dust-covered breakbeats. The influence of this and his 2006 debut cannot be overstated, feeding into the dub songcraft of the xx and James Blake, as well as an entire generation of ambient producers. It also anticipated the way London\u2019s clubland \u2013 and indeed communities \u2013 would be hollowed out by gentrification. Listen to the album. 30 Jay-Z The Blueprint (2001) Not only did it launch the career of Kanye West, showcasing his soul-sampling productions alongside those of Just Blaze, this album cemented Jay-Z as one of the greatest to ever do it. His evisceration of Nas on The Takeover made for a firebomb diss track, generating gossipy heat fanned further by some of his biggest pop moments: Girls, Girls, Girls, Izzo (HOVA) and Song Cry. Listen to the album. 29 Deftones White Pony (2000) By blending the frat-boy energy of nu-metal with the goth moods of Nine Inch Nails and Smashing Pumpkins, the northern Californians united rival factions of brooding teenagers with these strangely sexy studies in tension and release. Chino Moreno\u2019s voice is magnificently plastic \u2013 rapping, bellowing, crooning, and deploying his secret weapon: vocal fry that creaks like a door to a haunted house. Listen to the album. 28 Aaliyah Aaliyah (2001) This album is lauded for the three masterpieces Aaliyah made with Timbaland \u2013 Try Again, More Than a Woman and We Need a Resolution \u2013 that lend a serpentine malevolence to her voice, but there are also strong old-school jams and languorous ballads. Lesser R&amp;B stars match their voice to the beat \u2013 Aaliyah\u2019s genius, tragically cut short when she was killed in a plane crash, was to slink through it with an almost Latin sense of rhythm. Album not on streaming services. 27 Bj\u00f6rk Vespertine (2001) The gentle glitches and serene pulses on this intimate, sensual, clean record could sound naive, even simplistic, when put next to the complexity of her recent work with the producer Arca, but Vespertine remains one of Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s defining records thanks to the strength of its songwriting. Unison rivals Massive Attack\u2019s Unfinished Sympathy as the great ballad of trip-hop; It\u2019s Not Up to You is almost Disney-esque in its sweeping beauty. Listen to the album. 26 The xx xx (2009) Romy Madley-Croft and Oliver Sim made the most compelling duets of the period: rather than singing to each other, it was as if two people were going through the same thing without the other knowing it \u2013 the perfect mood music for the disconnected interconnection of dating apps and social media. Listen to the album. 25 Beyonc\u00e9 Lemonade (2016) We\u2019d seen Beyonc\u00e9 angry before, whether defiant on Survivor or chillingly, wittily calm on Irreplaceable, but never like this. Made after notable incidents of police brutality, Lemonade was charged with real political fervour, while there were numerous sharp jabs at Jay-Z for doing whatever predicated that elevator fight with her sister Solange. As a result, the final call for her ladies to get in formation felt genuinely martial. Listen to the album. 24 David Bowie Blackstar (2016) Released two days before he died, Blackstar saw Bowie pour everything left of him into his best album since his 70s hot streak. He spliced the itchy drum\u2019n\u2019bass and industrial moods that fascinated him in the 90s with terrifically freaky jazz, symphonic balladry and \u2013 on Girl Loves Me \u2013 authentically heavy rap. \u201cI\u2019m dying to push their backs against the grain / and fool them all again,\u201d he sang. And he did. Listen to the album. 23 OutKast Speakerboxxx / The Love Below (2003) Although less than the sum of their parts as they were on Stankonia, and with neither editing out the other\u2019s longueurs, the divided members of OutKast nevertheless delivered a vivacious pair of solo turns. Big Boi embraced saucy brass licks and propulsive flow while Andr\u00e9 3000 tapdanced through funk, though each arrived at solid gold pop: The Way You Move and Hey Ya! are both deserved wedding disco staples. Listen to the album. 22 Joanna Newsom Ys (2006) Newsom raised some eyebrows, even giggles, with her debut The Milk Eyed Mender thanks to her scrunched, cartoonishly girly voice. But on Ys, this unique instrument \u2013 alongside her beautiful harp, and orchestrations by Van Dyke Parks \u2013 plays out five masterpieces of American poetry to be filed alongside Whitman or the Beats: songs that move with the untamed direction of wind or water. Listen to the album. 21 PJ Harvey Let England Shake (2011) Harvey won her first Mercury prize for Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea on 9/11. She won her second for her other masterpiece, released 10 years later, in the shadow of the wars that dragged on between them. There is such anger as she reaches back to the first world war to show how every generation destroys its young in the same way \u2013 summed up by the pompous fanfare in The Glorious Land, crushed by a tank of blues-rock. Listen to the album. 20 Arcade Fire Funeral (2004) The deaths of relatives of band members Regine Chassaigne, Richard Reed Parry, and Win and Will Butler underpinned the (mostly) Canadian band\u2019s debut. The songs here are full of the horrible electricity of grief, Win Butler sometimes hollering at the pain, sometimes burned out by it. But the massed choruses suggest relief can be found in family, be it blood or otherwise, marking the arrival of one of the period\u2019s few great arena bands. Listen to the album. 19 PJ Harvey Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea (2000) More city than sea, PJ Harvey\u2019s most accessible and open-hearted record conjures that feeling of being on a rooftop, wanting to hear every story in the streets below you. It is full of energy, Harvey stalking the gutters and subways; it is full of sex, most of it new and dangerously in flux. But then there are moments on songs such as Beautiful Feeling or Horses in My Dreams, where the mass of bricks and steel dissipates and you\u2019re adrift on the ocean. Listen to the album. 18 Kanye West Yeezus (2013) Kanye dived into a hell of racism, commerce, relationship strife and his own ego, with beats made alongside a brains trust of experimental producers. It seethes with trauma both personal and social, and the strongest moments consider how black America is sticking its head in the sand \u2013 even Kanye himself, fretting about Kim while a sample of lynching lament Strange Fruit plays. But there are flickers of his old cheeky humour, especially in the immortal line: \u201cHurry up with my damn croissants!\u201d Listen to the album. 17 Outkast Stankonia (2000) The first rap masterpiece of the century was an epic that covered all of hip-hop\u2019s bases \u2013 horndog G-funk on We Luv Deez Hoez and I\u2019ll Call B4 I Cum, raunchy boom-bap on Xplosion, rap-rock on Gasoline Dreams, pop on Ms Jackson \u2013 but added endless new flavours: drum\u2019n\u2019bass, acid, psychedelic soul. Listen to the album. 16 Radiohead Kid A (2000) From the spine-tingling four-note downward melody that opens Everything in Its Right Place, it was clear that Radiohead had taken a huge leap into colder, stranger territory. The electronic influences that had filtered into OK Computer reached maturity \u2013 most spectacularly on techno anthem Idioteque \u2013 though there are way more guitars than its reputation suggests. Listen to the album. 15 Robyn Body Talk (2010) By blending the earnestness of ballad singing with cascading waves of electropop, Robyn became the master of heartbreak on the dancefloor. There is another side here, too: chatty, puckish and getting over it all. The anchor of the album \u2013 initially released in a trailblazing three parts across 2010 \u2013 was Dancing on My Own, a breakup song with a wildly transgressive edge: is there a secret erotic thrill behind the pain of going to the club to watch her partner with their new girlfriend? Listen to the album. 14 Kendrick Lamar good kid, m.A.A.d. city (2012) The breakthrough moment for rap\u2019s greatest ever talent. Loosely based around an LA street narrative, the storytelling was gripping; the bangers banged hard and it has Lamar\u2019s most gorgeous melodies, on Money Trees, Swimming Pools (Drank) and Bitch, Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe. The blithe stoicism of his flow, seemingly resigned to a violent death at any moment, fills the record with poignancy, and transmutes his words into wisdom. Listen to the album. 13 D\u2019Angelo Voodoo (2000) Bringing in a more rugged hip-hop mood to the neo-soul of his 1995 debut, D\u2019Angelo created a landmark in black American pop. His multitracked harmonies are some of the most beautiful sounds in all of music, and surely at least half of the Americans entering college this year were conceived to Untitled (How Does It Feel). Listen to the album. 12 Frank Ocean Channel Orange (2012) The sun-soaked indolence of being young in LA is etched in aquamarine, purple and, yes, orange on this psychedelic-pop landmark. The melody writing on Forrest Gump, Sweet Life, Thinkin Bout You, Lost and others is joyously accomplished and sturdy, leaving room for 10-minute electro suites, jazz-funk flexing, stoner rap and smoky neo-soul. A generation\u2019s Stevie Wonder had arrived. Listen to the album. 11 Radiohead In Rainbows (2007) Initially grabbing headlines for its pay-what-you-want release online, it quickly became clear that this was one of Radiohead\u2019s greatest albums. Undoing some of the knotted tension of the post-Bends era, it has rollicking rockers (Bodysnatchers, Jigsaw Falling into Place) and restless jitters (15 Step, Weird Fishes/Arpeggi), but the core songs are deep, considered trip-hop ballads such as Reckoner, House of Cards and All I Need. Listen to the album. 10 Frank Ocean Blonde (2016) Less immediately catchy than its predecessor, Channel Orange, Blonde is the more ambitious and visionary record. Resistant to being boxed in any one genre, the percussion retreats, the voice warps, the focus wanders and the emotion deepens as Ocean slips and stumbles through a series of poetic romances. A magical, impossible-to-imitate record. Listen to the album. 9 Beyonc\u00e9 Beyonc\u00e9 (2013) Love and self have always been Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s two grand themes, but they were each invested with more passion and nuance than ever before on her fifth solo album. Appearing from nowhere with videos for every track, it announced her as the era\u2019s defining megastar \u2013 marketing campaigns, it implied, were for the little people. But the album has endured past its grand entrance thanks to its detailed, impassioned considerations of femininity and marital sexuality. Listen to the album. 8 Arctic Monkeys Whatever People Say I Am, That\u2019s What I\u2019m Not (2006) He may now sing in an ironic mid-Atlantic croon, but Alex Turner started off with the most tangibly south Yorkshire voice in pop since Jarvis Cocker. Over street-fighting indie rock, he told of dirty dancefloors and scummy men, an observer sitting with his faced pressed up against a taxi window on a Saturday night watching humans bounce off one another. Listen to the album. 7 The Streets Original Pirate Material (2002) You can almost touch the gold teeth, Valentinos and dreads in Mike Skinner\u2019s debut, a love letter to living for the weekend written in UK garage that heralded the arrival of a brilliant British storyteller \u2013 Weak Become Heroes remains the single greatest evocation of being on ecstasy in a club. Listen to the album. 6 Dizzee Rascal Boy in da Corner (2003) If Wiley\u2019s \u201ceski beats\u201d acknowledged grime\u2019s froideur, then Dizzee Rascal turned the temperature down further: his debut is a chillblained study in urban harshness that remains grime\u2019s masterpiece album. Amid videogame clatter, Rascal\u2019s voice is full of scorn and bafflement as he considers girls, rivals and his place in the world. Listen to the album. 5 LCD Soundsystem Sound of Silver (2007) James Murphy\u2019s group were the smart, snippy toast of Brooklyn after the hyper-literate breakthrough tracks Losing My Edge and Yeah. On their second album, they broke through the snark, pondering their identities as New Yorkers, Americans and thirtysomethings \u2013 and with a range of potential dance moves, from pogoing to sleek disco shapes. Listen to the album. 4 Kendrick Lamar To Pimp a Butterfly (2015) Folding in influences from LA\u2019s beat scene \u2013 including Kamasi Washington and Flying Lotus \u2013 Lamar exploded the possibilities for rap in the 2010s, bouncing like a car down Crenshaw on to neo-soul, jazz and squelchy funk. The police-baiting Alright became a civil-rights anthem for the post-Ferguson era \u2013 indeed, as a celebration of the richness of black artistry, the whole album was a riposte to bigotry. Listen to the album. 3 Kanye West My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) He would later lose the thread in a very public fashion, but Kanye West pulled every strand of his genius and torment together on his masterpiece: anthemic choruses, psychodrama lyrics and an all-star cast, from Bon Iver to that Nicki Minaj verse. West\u2019s bombastic production, meanwhile, included samples of everything from King Crimson to Aphex Twin: a symphony to a new, omnivorous digital culture. Listen to the album. 2 The Strokes Is This It? (2001) After Britpop devolved into bedwetter indie and the US was churning out goofy pop-punk, the debut album by the New York quintet showed rock how to be cool again: all droll, drawling observations and guitar lines that steamed into a dive bar to show up the clientele. Oh, and your boss trying to be trendy by wearing a T-shirt under his blazer at the office on Fridays? Blame these guys. Listen to the album. 1 Amy Winehouse Back to Black (2006) That title sounds horribly prescient in the wake of the substance misuse that would kill her, but Winehouse was incandescently alive \u2013 funny, pissed off, in love \u2013 on her finest album. Producer Mark Ronson\u2019s luxuriant backings, which cherrypicked from the previous century of popular music (doo-wop, soul, hip-hop), are saved from mere classiness by that voice: impetuous, inimitable, always reaching for the wrong interval that turns out to be totally right.

If it weren\u2019t so thrilling, it would be exhausting.</p> <p>Sometimes the Patriots start slowly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/16/tom-brady-new-england-patriots-season-problems\">They can be sluggish through the early months</a> of the season. Bill Belichick likes to experiment, always with an eye towards December and January: he\u2019s not playing for October. But sometimes everything slots perfectly into place. His teams coalesce into a juggernaut from the get go. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/09/new-england-patriots-pittsburgh-steelers-nfl-sunday-night-football\">After their 33-3 thumping of the Steelers</a> on the opening Sunday of the 2019 season, it looks like it will be the latter.</p> <p>Pittsburgh are expected to be one of the top contenders in the AFC. The Patriots dispatched them with the kind of brutal efficiency that signaled to the league that they are as good as ever. The Steelers couldn\u2019t move the ball on offense. The Patriots revamped offensive line effortlessly pushed the Steelers front seven backward. Receivers ran wide open. Tom Brady threw for 341 yards. It could have easily been 500. And he did so without Antonio Brown, the team\u2019s latest addition and one of the best receivers in football.</p> <p>(Brown is currently under investigation from the league <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/10/antonio-brown-rape-lawsuit-florida\">after a civil suit that claims he raped his former trainer</a>. Whether or not he ever sees the field for the Patriots remains an open question. Brown\u2019s attorney says his client denies the allegations.)</p> <p>The results are the same. But the style, as ever, is evolving in real time. Belichick is a shapeshifter. It\u2019s the key to his unprecedented success. Losing Rob Gronkowski \u2013 the greatest to ever play tight end \u2013 was an incalculable blow. Most teams would dip into the draft to find their next star or scotch-tape their way through a season with a grizzly veteran and a talented yet unrefined rookie.</p> <p>Not Belichick. He overhauled the team\u2019s offensive design, subbing in a wide receiver for a tight end. During their win over the Steelers, the Patriots ran 25 plays without a tight end on the field. During the entire 2018 season, New England ran only 24 offensive plays with zero tight ends on the field. Belichick redefined the geography of the Patriots offense.</p> <p>If there is one thing that distinguishes the coaches who have had sustained periods of success \u2013 Belichick, Bill Walsh, Chuck Noll \u2013 it is that they have always been able to evolve. They are crazed self-evaluators: great is never good enough. They figure out when it\u2019s time to bin a winning formula and implement a new one. Nobody has consistently adapted as much as Belichick, this is just his latest volume. And this may be his most devastating team since the Patriots went 16-0 in the 2007 season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/09/miami-dolphins-nfl-tanking\">The Dolphins are built to lose. And it looks like their players hate it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet dig deep enough and you find the question marks. Offensive lines and pass rush win Super Bowls. The right line can elevate an average quarterback into a championship-caliber one. Consistent pressure can vaporize the skills of even the very best.</p> <p>Creating pressure on the opposing quarterback is the Patriots\u2019 biggest weakness. They pressured the Steelers on just 6% of dropbacks in week one, dead stinking last in the NFL (the league average last season was 23%). No team during the 2018 season had a single game where they pressured the quarterback on fewer than 8% of snaps and won.</p> <p>Having a $25m star pass-rusher is not part of the Patriot Way. They\u2019ve had a pair on their roster in recent years, but they let Chandler Jones and Trey Flowers walk. Instead, the Patriots scheme pressures. They have <em><a href=\"https://nesn.com/2019/08/why-nfl-writer-believes-patriots-feature-leagues-best-secondary/\">the </a></em><a href=\"https://nesn.com/2019/08/why-nfl-writer-believes-patriots-feature-leagues-best-secondary/\">best secondary in the league</a>. The Patriots look to contain and confuse quarterbacks on the back end, buying the team\u2019s pass rush a couple of extra beats to get home. It was enough against the Steelers, but pressuring on fewer than 15-20% per game is an unsustainable model.</p> <p>The Patriots pressured opponents on 33% of dropbacks in 2018, the sixth-best mark in the league. But when Flowers walked out the door he took his 42.5 pressures with him. Rather than pen Flowers to a big deal, the Patriots are looking to recreate his figure by committee. Michael Bennett joined in the offseason, fresh of a 34-pressure season in Philadelphia, a number good for 23rd in the league. Deatrich Wise and rookie Chase Winovich, both young, talented players, will look to make up the difference.</p> <p>There are also potential problems among the men employed to protect Brady.<strong> </strong>Tackle Trent Brown left in the offseason; center David Andrews, one of the league\u2019s best, is out for the season with blood clots; right tackle Marcus Cannon went down in week one with an injury. He will miss time, but not the whole season.</p> <p>That group was dominant last season. They conceded pass pressure on just 22% of snaps, the best in the league. For the uninitiated, that\u2019s a bonkers number. Some of that was thanks to Brady getting rid of the ball quickly, but mostly it was due to the big guys up front. Can their replacements maintain that level? Week one <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OllieConnolly/status/1171753925264977920\">suggests it\u2019s possible</a>. But the offensive line\u2019s margin for error is slim to none. If the team suffers even more attrition over the course of the season, it could derail everything they\u2019re trying to do on offense.</p> <p>Which brings us to Brady. He will turn 43 this season, but he looked 23 on Sunday. He remains homicidally competitive. Never has he been surrounded by such receiving talent: Julian Edelman, a Super Bowl MVP and Brady\u2019s best buddy; Josh Gordon, revitalized, sober, a Hall of Fame talent who was downright unstoppable on Sunday night; N\u2019Keal Harry, the only wide receiver selected with a first-round draft pick in the Brady-Belichick era; Phillip Dorsett, one of the quickest players in the league. And if Brown\u2019s legal issues don\u2019t stop him playing, they will have one of the finest receivers of his generation.</p> <p>How do you stop that? You probably don\u2019t.</p> <p>The most fearsome franchise in US sports won it all again and <em>still </em>improved. They\u2019re deep, multi-faceted and laden with star power on both sides of the ball, as well as facing the easiest schedule of any team in the league <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Outsiders#DVOA\">by DVOA</a>. Issues in the trenches may doom them, as it has many sides dubbed a \u201cdream team\u201d. But there\u2019s something different about this because everything is always different with the Patriots. Except winning.</p>",

If there is one thing that distinguishes the coaches who have had sustained periods of success \u2013 Belichick, Bill Walsh, Chuck Noll \u2013 it is that they have always been able to evolve. They are crazed self-evaluators: great is never good enough. They figure out when it\u2019s time to bin a winning formula and implement a new one. Nobody has consistently adapted as much as Belichick, this is just his latest volume. And this may be his most devastating team since the Patriots went 16-0 in the 2007 season. Yet dig deep enough and you find the question marks. Offensive lines and pass rush win Super Bowls. The right line can elevate an average quarterback into a championship-caliber one. Consistent pressure can vaporize the skills of even the very best. Creating pressure on the opposing quarterback is the Patriots\u2019 biggest weakness. They pressured the Steelers on just 6% of dropbacks in week one, dead stinking last in the NFL (the league average last season was 23%). No team during the 2018 season had a single game where they pressured the quarterback on fewer than 8% of snaps and won. Having a $25m star pass-rusher is not part of the Patriot Way. They\u2019ve had a pair on their roster in recent years, but they let Chandler Jones and Trey Flowers walk. Instead, the Patriots scheme pressures. They have the best secondary in the league. The Patriots look to contain and confuse quarterbacks on the back end, buying the team\u2019s pass rush a couple of extra beats to get home. It was enough against the Steelers, but pressuring on fewer than 15-20% per game is an unsustainable model. The Patriots pressured opponents on 33% of dropbacks in 2018, the sixth-best mark in the league. But when Flowers walked out the door he took his 42.5 pressures with him. Rather than pen Flowers to a big deal, the Patriots are looking to recreate his figure by committee. Michael Bennett joined in the offseason, fresh of a 34-pressure season in Philadelphia, a number good for 23rd in the league. Deatrich Wise and rookie Chase Winovich, both young, talented players, will look to make up the difference. There are also potential problems among the men employed to protect Brady. Tackle Trent Brown left in the offseason; center David Andrews, one of the league\u2019s best, is out for the season with blood clots; right tackle Marcus Cannon went down in week one with an injury. He will miss time, but not the whole season. That group was dominant last season. They conceded pass pressure on just 22% of snaps, the best in the league. For the uninitiated, that\u2019s a bonkers number. Some of that was thanks to Brady getting rid of the ball quickly, but mostly it was due to the big guys up front. Can their replacements maintain that level? Week one suggests it\u2019s possible. But the offensive line\u2019s margin for error is slim to none. If the team suffers even more attrition over the course of the season, it could derail everything they\u2019re trying to do on offense. Which brings us to Brady. He will turn 43 this season, but he looked 23 on Sunday. He remains homicidally competitive. Never has he been surrounded by such receiving talent: Julian Edelman, a Super Bowl MVP and Brady\u2019s best buddy; Josh Gordon, revitalized, sober, a Hall of Fame talent who was downright unstoppable on Sunday night; N\u2019Keal Harry, the only wide receiver selected with a first-round draft pick in the Brady-Belichick era; Phillip Dorsett, one of the quickest players in the league. And if Brown\u2019s legal issues don\u2019t stop him playing, they will have one of the finest receivers of his generation. How do you stop that? You probably don\u2019t. The most fearsome franchise in US sports won it all again and still improved. They\u2019re deep, multi-faceted and laden with star power on both sides of the ball, as well as facing the easiest schedule of any team in the league by DVOA. Issues in the trenches may doom them, as it has many sides dubbed a \u201cdream team\u201d. But there\u2019s something different about this because everything is always different with the Patriots. Except winning.",

There\u2019s nothing to learn from the Germans; we did too little and too late.\u2019 And there is something paradoxical about saying: \u2018Well, we committed this terrible crime, but weren\u2019t we great at coming to terms with it?\u2019 You can\u2019t really say that. But someone who\u2019s a semi-outsider as I am, can, in fact, say that.\u201d</p> <p>Neiman, a moral philosopher, spent part of her childhood in the American south and she has written a comparative study of how Germany has come to terms with the crimes of nazism, and why the US, in failing to confront its own human rights abuses, should take note. Ambitious and detailed, it ranges from the initial reluctance of German citizens to begin the process of truth and reconciliation to small-town Mississippi, and the shooting of nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, four years ago.</p> <p>It was that massacre, carried out by a white supremacist, that prompted Neiman, whose previous books include an examination of the concept of evil, to begin researching and writing <em>Learning from the Germans</em>. From her home in Berlin, where she has lived for the past 22 years, Neiman watched Barack Obama give a heartrending eulogy to the dead, and then followed as governors began to order the taking down of Confederate flags, and Walmart announced that it would stop selling Confederate memorabilia. It struck her that amid the horror lurked a hopeful moment \u2013 a moment of potential change \u2013 and that she herself had \u201csome knowledge and experience that I could share, that might be helpful\u201d.</p> <p>Neiman\u2019s mother campaigned for the desegregation of Atlanta\u2019s public schools \u2013 an activity that earned her, as Neiman recalls, several late-night phone calls from the Ku Klux Klan. One hot summer\u2019s day, her mother invited an African American friend and her children over for the afternoon, and Neiman asked if they could all go to the outdoor swimming pool. No, came the answer. The lake, then? Still no. Imploring and questioning did not change the answer. In the end, the children played beneath the garden sprinklers; only years later did Neiman realise that it would have been against the law for them to have swum together.</p> <p>In early adulthood, Neiman went to Berlin to study Kant, leaving just before the wall came down in 1989; after a period at Yale and a return to Berlin, she spent five years living in Tel Aviv, arriving after the Oslo peace agreement and leaving before the second intifada. She smiles wryly at her strange sense of historical timing, but the underlying point is that she has lived in a succession of places in which the past lies heavy on the present. And, perhaps even more crucially, she has done so with an outsider\u2019s perspective and the distance to ask difficult questions.

And it\u2019s very important to look at particular histories. But you can certainly get an idea of: number one, how hard it is; number two, that it\u2019s nevertheless possible; and number three, that a country can come out much better on the other side. It can be a source of strength and not weakness.\u201d</p> <p>Neiman does not stint on impressing on her readers the details of number one, drawing on a vast body of interviews \u2013 half, she estimates, didn\u2019t even make it into the book \u2013 to explore how long history\u2019s tail is. It is too easy, she argues, to believe that as soon as the second world war ended, Germany set about the process of atoning for its crimes. It simply isn\u2019t so: after all, 10% of the country\u2019s population had been members of the Nazi party, \u201cand the most shocking, but also important thing, is they were not the uneducated masses. The majority had academic degrees. We like to think that education provides immunity to racist and fascist ideology. And it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>What, then, heralded the start of Germans en masse beginning to face the past? Although some of it can be explained generationally, she replies, as people died off, \u201cthat won\u2019t do the trick, as we\u2019ve seen in the United States. And as we\u2019ve seen in Britain where, you know, time has gone by, and people like falling back on national myths of greatness.\u201d In part, she believes the Auschwitz trials marked a moment of change in which the burgeoning of mass travel connected ordinary Germans with other worldviews and there was an emergence of books by Holocaust survivors. She also notes the importance of 1968, \u201ca moment for confronting parents and teachers \u2026 and there was a sense of a sudden real wave of disgust and rebellion: what have you done?\u201d</p> <p>Neiman is also at pains to point out that this work was done more quickly and more effectively in East Germany \u2013 much of which went unnoticed because of the relentless focus on West German attempts at rehabilitation. \u201cWhenever you say anything good about East Germany,\u201d she says, \u201cimmediately somebody jumps up and says, \u2018My God, you\u2019re a Stalinist \u2026 \u2019 I\u2019m not defending everything about it, of course. But I laboured on the chapter that talks about the east. I fact-checked it; I had somebody else fact-check it. I knew that I was going to get a lot of flak for that. But in the beginning, East Germany did a better job. They just did. On every level: in terms of bringing old Nazis to trial, in terms of teaching the period in schools, in terms of building monuments, and restoring concentration camps and making them educational.\u201d Meanwhile, the west was so busy fighting a new conflict \u2013 \u201cold Nazis were the best people to fight the cold war\u201d \u2013 that efforts at serious denazification went by the board.</p> <p>As one might expect from a philosopher \u2013 especially one who has side-stepped the academy to work across disciplines \u2013 Neiman is fascinating and potent on how the Holocaust has functioned on multiple planes, and primarily as an example of pure evil that, by consequence, allows other societies to divert attention from their own misdeeds. \u201cNothing else even comes close to it. And if you haven\u2019t done that, well, then you\u2019re doing fairly well \u2026 you know, it\u2019s as if we would like to have a large black hole that says, this is where you put evil and we don\u2019t have to look at it.\u201d</p> <p>She has, she says, been shocked by the lack of knowledge in Britain about the Nazi period, which naturally leads us into a conversation about the fondness of rightwing politicians for invoking the glories of the war, \u201cthis nostalgia for the empire that you see all over the place with Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg and I suppose Boris Johnson too ... As if the empire really was a wonderful thing, as if it brought nothing but civilisation to the rest of the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This nostalgia that you see \u2013 it\u2019s as if the British empire brought nothing but civilisation to\u00a0the rest of the\u00a0world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She started to write the book before Donald Trump and before Brexit, and there have been times when she has felt \u201cquite despairing\u201d about whether her contribution will be of any practical use. But she has got over that. When I remark that prejudice appears to become more and more entrenched, she counters that the resistance to that prejudice is also growing.</p> <p>\u201cWhat one can simply do is strengthen the voices, and say it is absolutely time that we come to terms with parts of our past, we can\u2019t sweep them under the rug. And it\u2019s possible to come out the other side. It\u2019s not the case that all a country needs to do is beat its breast and talk about its failures and its crimes, which is, of course, what the right always accuses people on the left of doing. But if you don\u2019t do that, you get explosions of things, like the kind of nationalism and racism that we\u2019ve seen in so many countries lately.\u201d</p> <p>In Germany, she says, there has been anxiety about the regional elections and the growth of rightwing nationalism; but she doesn\u2019t believe the movement is so widespread as to become a problem in the way that Brexit is in the UK, or Marine Le Pen in France, Matteo Salvini in Italy or Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski in Poland. And in terms of the US, while they are not flying swastikas in Bavaria, she notes, they are flying Confederate flags in the south, encouraged by an administration that is quite happy to foster hatred and demonisation of the other.</p> <p>In the course of writing the book, Neiman met and interviewed vast numbers of activists and citizens in the American south. One of the key questions she wanted the book to ask was, if we insist on saying that we have to remember the Holocaust in order to learn from it, then what do we want to learn? \u201cAnd what it seems to me we can learn is, be aware of the beginnings. Be aware of racism, be aware of nationalism. The Nazis went very slowly and carefully to see what the population would accept.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of the long tail kept returning, and with it the fact that slavery did not end with the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. Slavery in the US continued by other means for at least 90 years, she argues, and was sometimes even more brutal than the previous regimes. Men were deprived of their liberty by, for example, the invention of the crime of vagrancy, which was used to arrest African Americans and put them to work in mines and in factories, often with the collusion of the police.\u201cIf you start looking at the history between the Emancipation Proclamation, and Rosa Parks and the Montgomery bus boycott, it was neo-slavery or an age of racist terror rather than Jim Crow, which is a name that a lot of African Americans are rejecting. It\u2019s just too harmless to describe what was actually happening.\u201d</p> <p>What African Americans are currently withstanding \u2013 radically poorer health outcomes and inequality in education, judicial and incarceration systems, and police brutality directed predominantly towards young black men \u2013 is, Neiman argues, part and parcel of white America\u2019s inability to face up to its past, and to the crimes it has committed against African Americans and Native Americans. Only, she says, when you decide to be an adult can you begin to effect change.</p> <p>\u201cI really do see that our relationship to our nation is like a grown-up relationship to our parents. We have to sort this through and say: \u2018These parts of my national history I can be proud of and I can stand by, and these parts I\u2019m sorry for and I\u2019d like to do my best to somehow make up for.\u2019 And I think, once you go through a process like that, you can begin to have a kind of healthy nationalism or patriotism. Which isn\u2019t that my country is better than all countries. But it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Learning from the Germans: Confronting Race and the Memory of Evil by Susan Neiman is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320).

The Nazis went very slowly and carefully to see what the population would accept.\u201d The idea of the long tail kept returning, and with it the fact that slavery did not end with the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. Slavery in the US continued by other means for at least 90 years, she argues, and was sometimes even more brutal than the previous regimes. Men were deprived of their liberty by, for example, the invention of the crime of vagrancy, which was used to arrest African Americans and put them to work in mines and in factories, often with the collusion of the police.\u201cIf you start looking at the history between the Emancipation Proclamation, and Rosa Parks and the Montgomery bus boycott, it was neo-slavery or an age of racist terror rather than Jim Crow, which is a name that a lot of African Americans are rejecting. It\u2019s just too harmless to describe what was actually happening.\u201d What African Americans are currently withstanding \u2013 radically poorer health outcomes and inequality in education, judicial and incarceration systems, and police brutality directed predominantly towards young black men \u2013 is, Neiman argues, part and parcel of white America\u2019s inability to face up to its past, and to the crimes it has committed against African Americans and Native Americans. Only, she says, when you decide to be an adult can you begin to effect change. \u201cI really do see that our relationship to our nation is like a grown-up relationship to our parents. We have to sort this through and say: \u2018These parts of my national history I can be proud of and I can stand by, and these parts I\u2019m sorry for and I\u2019d like to do my best to somehow make up for.\u2019 And I think, once you go through a process like that, you can begin to have a kind of healthy nationalism or patriotism. Which isn\u2019t that my country is better than all countries. But it\u2019s mine.\u201d \u2022 Learning from the Germans: Confronting Race and the Memory of Evil by Susan Neiman is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

      "bodyText": "A highly secret government-commissioned review into skyrocketing rates of clearing of native vegetation for farming in New South Wales has been completed and is likely to add to simmering tensions between the Liberals and Nationals within cabinet. The review, which was triggered when land clearing exceeded 20,000 hectares in less than a year, has been undertaken by the NSW Natural Resources Commission, an independent body, and is soon to be considered by cabinet. It is investigating clearing rates since the new Biodiversity Conservation Act began in August 2017 and whether the Act is working to preserve biodiversity. The NRC\u2019s chief executive, Bryce Wilde, confirmed his agency had been asked by the premier to do the review on 14 January, just before the state election, and had handed the findings to the government six weeks ago. But the mention in an estimates committee on Friday was the first time it had become public. The NRC said the review was \u201ccabinet in confidence\u201d and had sought information from departments only. It did not seek any public or industry submissions, although Wilde said the NRC had sought expert input from consultants, who signed confidentiality agreements. The review \u2013 and what to do about the escalation of land clearing in NSW \u2013 will add to the tensions between the Liberals and Nationals over stewardship of the environment. The Coalition partners are already at loggerheads over key policies including management of wild brumbies in national parks, water policy and calls by the Nationals to allow logging in the River Red Gum national park on the Murray. This week the agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, whose seat covers much of northern NSW where the land clearing is occurring, flagged introducing a \u201cregional code\u201d for clearing in the north-west of NSW, saying the current laws were not working well for large-scale farming enterprises. This was interpreted as a plan to further relax the rules for when farmers can clear without a permit \u2013 at least in this region. Regional codes were foreshadowed in the Biodiversity Conservation Act and a pilot is being run near Walgett. But the secret NRC review is likely to bolster the arguments of the environment minister, Matt Kean, and the senior portfolio minister, Rob Stokes, who are known to be deeply concerned about the rapid escalation of land clearing and its impact on biodiversity. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The most recent figures released by the Office of Environment and Heritage for 2017-18 \u2013 the first year of the new Act \u2013 show that land clearing for agriculture has jumped sharply to 27,100 hectares, triple the level in 2014-15. Clearing has likely increased again in 2018-19. But even before the new laws came into force, farmers, particularly those in the north-west of the state, had begun extensive clearing operations to turn grazing country into cropping land for wheat, cotton, soya beans, chickpeas and lucerne. Senior bureaucrats confirmed the review had been triggered some time ago. \u201cMy understanding was that there is a nominal trigger of about 20,000 hectares per annum,\u201d the chief executive of Local Land Services, David Witherdin, said in estimates. Local Land Services is responsible for advising farmers on whether they require a permit and assisting with best practice farming. When the independent MP Justin Field expressed surprise about the existence of the review, Witherdin replied: \u201cThe review has been completed.\u201d \u201cThis is a matter of significant public interest,\u201d Field said. \u201cEnvironmentalists always warned that a spike in land-clearing would occur under the controversial Liberal/Nationals biodiversity laws. \u201cThis review should have been conducted in an open and transparent way.

The Guardian has obtained letters under freedom of information laws between the then primary industries minister, Niall Blair, and the former environment minister, Gabrielle Upton, that were exchanged at the time she offered her concurrence to the new laws in August 2017. They refer to a review of the need for additional safeguards and concerns by the independent panel which advised on the new Act that it would lead to a loss of biodiversity in some regions. The environment groups were so concerned with the lack of protections under the new legislation that they walked out of the consultation process. One member of the independent panel and an expert in biodiversity, Professor Hugh Possingham, also quit.

New Zealand is showing the way: its first wellbeing budget was published this year, and its five priorities include taking mental health seriously, improving child wellbeing and reshaping the economy to spread the benefits. Making health a measure of our collective success is a brilliantly simple idea. It would be a goal we could all could benefit from and understand. With air pollution an important factor, it would seamlessly dovetail with action on climate change. Local government would have a big role to play, particularly in creating environments that support children\u2019s physical and mental health. Reopening hundreds of Sure Start centres would be a good place to begin. For a government keen on infrastructure projects, affordable and accessible transport systems could be a vote winner. But they do not have to be state of the art rapid transport to make a difference; running decent bus services between deprived coastal towns and major cities could have a massive impact. But despite endless examples in the UK and across the world of smart things that could improve health and wellbeing, over the past decade our government has been unwavering in its determination to prioritise short-term crisis management, upward wealth redistribution and headline-grabbing proposals over long-term improvements in people\u2019s lives. In-work and child poverty are the result. Health Foundation analysis of government figures indicates child poverty will keep rising for at least five more years on the back of yet more cuts to working age welfare support. Spending on homelessness perfectly encapsulates the dysfunctional way Conservative governments have approached spending. Analysis by the Guardian and the housing charity Shelter in January found that councils across England spent \u00a3997m on temporary accommodation in 2017-18, a 71% increase on the \u00a3584m in 2012-13, as more people have been driven on to the streets by benefit cuts, reductions in local authority housing spending and erosion of other services such as addiction treatment. On average, the lives of rough sleepers are 30 years shorter. Putting health and wellbeing at the heart of government policy would benefit everybody, provide levers on everything from the economy to the environment and encourage joined-up, long-term policies. It might even be a political objective we could all, at least in principle, agree on.",

      "bodyText": "Cancer survival rates in the UK have long lagged behind those in other countries of comparable wealth and income levels. And an international study published this week shows that while the UK is making rapid progress, there\u2019s still a big gap in the survival rates cancer patients can expect in Britain compared with countries such as Australia, Canada and Norway. The good news is that the outlook for patients suffering from major forms of cancer has got much better. On an age standardised basis, fewer than half of patients with rectal cancer in the UK lived more than five years in 1995. By 2014, more than 60% did. And we should take the bad news with a pinch of salt because comparing cancer survival across countries is so inherently difficult. There is a risk that some countries look as though their patients are more likely to live extra years just because they have started counting sooner. But this isn\u2019t an isolated finding: the UK performs consistently poorly in international studies, suggesting there is something very real to worry about. The gaps are not small: if people in the UK survived at the same rate as those in Austria or Canada, 20 in every 100 people with lung cancer would live for five years, instead of 13 in every 100. For some cancers, the international gap doesn\u2019t even appear to be closing. So why aren\u2019t patients in the UK living as long, and what can we do about it?

      "bodyText": "Brazil\u2019s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, will meet a rightwing US advocacy group that denies climate change, just four days before the United Nations Climate Action Summit. Salles will meet representatives from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) at the headquarters of the US Environmental Protection Agency on 19 September, Brazil\u2019s Folha de S Paulo newspaper revealed. The meeting was immediately condemned by environmentalists, who said it showed that the government of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, had no commitment to fighting the climate crisis. News of the meeting emerged a day after Brazil\u2019s foreign minister questioned the scientific proof for global warming in a convoluted speech in Washington. Addressing the Heritage Foundation, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo said \u201cthere is no climate catastrophe\u201d and described efforts to fight climate change as a plot to destroy national sovereignty. Brazil is doubling down on its efforts to convince the world the Amazon is in safe hands, despite soaring deforestation and a huge spike in seasonal fires that provoked an international crisis. Bolsonaro is due to address the UN general assembly on 24 September. \u201cThis is a government that makes efforts to deny the problems, not to face them,\u201d said Marcio Astrini, director of public policy at Greenpeace Brasil. A spokesman for Salles said he could not confirm nor deny the meeting and a spokeswoman for the Competitive Enterprise Institute did not respond to requests for comment. The CEI\u2019s director for energy and environment, Myron Ebell, led Donald Trump\u2019s transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency. His biography quotes Business Insider, which said: \u201cMyron Ebell may be enemy #1 to the current climate change community.\u201d \u201cClimate change does not endanger the survival of civilization or the habitability of the planet. So-called climate solutions are bureaucratic power grabs and corporate welfare schemes with no detectable climate-related benefits,\u201d read a June article on the CEI site. Before Salles took office in December, a S\u00e3o Paulo judge found he had altered plans for an environmentally protected area in order to favour businesses while state environment secretary. Salles denied the accusations and is appealing against the ruling. In July he said that Brazil was not far from \u201czero illegal deforestation\u201d. Satellite date from Brazil\u2019s Space Research Institute calculated a 278% increase in deforestation in July. The institute\u2019s director was fired after Bolsonaro described the data as \u201clies\u201d. Its data showed more than 30,000 fires in the Amazon in August, the highest since 2010. In a recent interview with the far-right Canadian YouTuber Stefan Molyneux, Salles hailed Brazil\u2019s conservation record. The minister argued that a primary cause of deforestation was the lack of proper documentation for Amazon land, despite widespread evidence that much degradation takes place in protected areas and indigenous reserves and has been partly fuelled by Bolsonaro\u2019s attacks on environment agencies and protection.",

But as a vocal campaigner against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, he is getting used to rather a different kind of reception.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been spat at,\u201d Britain\u2019s storyteller-in-chief says nonchalantly over lunch at his local pub in an idyllic Devon village. \u201cI went to Sidmouth folk festival \u2013 quite a peaceable part of the world, you would have thought.\u201d The trouble began when he bought one of the \u201clittle blue badges with stars around it\u201d. Clare, Morpurgo\u2019s wife of 56 years, interjects. \u201cNo, it said, \u2018Bollocks to Brexit.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it had stars around it!\u201d Morpurgo says in mock indignation. As for the spitting: \u201cIt was horrible. I was very upset. [The man] looked at me with an unbelievable dislike. I can\u2019t think of a time in my life when that would have happened. We\u2019re almost coming to a civil war situation where there\u2019s so much hate.\u201d</p> <p>When not putting his head above the parapet with newspaper articles and an appearance in what Channel 4 News called \u201cthe most polite Brexit debate ever\u201d, Morpurgo can be found at home in bed, writing prolifically in school exercise books while propped up on a pile of pillows (inspired by his hero, Robert Louis Stevenson).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf52320b4e417cc7861ec7b281a6cd221897240d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf52320b4e417cc7861ec7b281a6cd221897240d/0_306_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019ve become a selfish people, an unkind people\u2019 \u2026 Morpurgo at home in Devon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019ve become a selfish people, an unkind people\u2019 \u2026 Morpurgo at home in Devon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his latest book, Boy Giant, he takes on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees\">refugee crisis</a> with an update of Jonathan Swift\u2019s Gulliver\u2019s Travels. His Lilliput is one in which strangers are welcomed in and emperors have been replaced with storytellers. I tell him I found the first section \u2013 detailing 12-year-old Omar\u2019s escape from Afghanistan, alone in an over-filled, sinking rubber boat \u2013 distressing. \u201cI\u2019m glad of that,\u201d he says, unsurprised. After all, it is the adults who tend to come out of War Horse in tears.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult line to draw, but I think one must err on the side of upsetting people. The minute you make it bland and you tie a yellow ribbon around it and say, \u2018Actually it\u2019s fine\u2019 ... well, it\u2019s not. That is the reality. The rest of the book may be wishful thinking, but that\u2019s what these children are living through.\u201d Morpurgo resolved to write the book after seeing the body of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alan-kurdi\">the three-year-old Syrian boy, Alan Kurdi</a>, washed up on a Turkish beach in September 2015.</p> <p>\u201cJust as when I wrote about the first world war, I don\u2019t want anyone to feel comfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not entertainment. All literature should be, yes, life-enhancing, but troubling \u2013 at the end of the day it should be forcing you to ask questions. But I am sorry if it upsets you too much. Have another sip of beer.\u201d</p> <p>The book\u2019s Brexit and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> parallels are plain. Morpurgo\u2019s favourite part of the story is when Omar turns a stone wall separating two peoples into a bridge. At one point, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliput_and_Blefuscu\">Lilliput</a>\u2019s elder stateswoman declares: \u201cWe shall fish together, trade with one another, be friends again as we always were for hundreds of years \u2026 There will be no more walls, no more flags, no more tyrants.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b255c87615ae29b31222d9bd4370d1db0f7a4b87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b255c87615ae29b31222d9bd4370d1db0f7a4b87/0_1372_6495_2639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Invader alert \u2026 one of Michael Foreman\u2019s illustrations for Boy Giant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"406\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Invader alert \u2026 one of Michael Foreman\u2019s illustrations for Boy Giant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Michael Foreman 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In between sips of pea and ham soup, Morpurgo details his despair with the world.

      "bodyText": "Michael Morpurgo has all the trappings befitting a prolific, bestselling and beloved children\u2019s author. There is the National Theatre production (War Horse, still touring the globe) and its Spielberg movie adaptation; the stint as children\u2019s laureate (a post he helped create); the gold Blue Peter badge and the knighthood. But as a vocal campaigner against Brexit, he is getting used to rather a different kind of reception. \u201cI\u2019ve been spat at,\u201d Britain\u2019s storyteller-in-chief says nonchalantly over lunch at his local pub in an idyllic Devon village. \u201cI went to Sidmouth folk festival \u2013 quite a peaceable part of the world, you would have thought.\u201d The trouble began when he bought one of the \u201clittle blue badges with stars around it\u201d. Clare, Morpurgo\u2019s wife of 56 years, interjects. \u201cNo, it said, \u2018Bollocks to Brexit.\u2019\u201d \u201cWell, it had stars around it!\u201d Morpurgo says in mock indignation. As for the spitting: \u201cIt was horrible. I was very upset. [The man] looked at me with an unbelievable dislike. I can\u2019t think of a time in my life when that would have happened. We\u2019re almost coming to a civil war situation where there\u2019s so much hate.\u201d When not putting his head above the parapet with newspaper articles and an appearance in what Channel 4 News called \u201cthe most polite Brexit debate ever\u201d, Morpurgo can be found at home in bed, writing prolifically in school exercise books while propped up on a pile of pillows (inspired by his hero, Robert Louis Stevenson). In his latest book, Boy Giant, he takes on the refugee crisis with an update of Jonathan Swift\u2019s Gulliver\u2019s Travels. His Lilliput is one in which strangers are welcomed in and emperors have been replaced with storytellers. I tell him I found the first section \u2013 detailing 12-year-old Omar\u2019s escape from Afghanistan, alone in an over-filled, sinking rubber boat \u2013 distressing. \u201cI\u2019m glad of that,\u201d he says, unsurprised. After all, it is the adults who tend to come out of War Horse in tears. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult line to draw, but I think one must err on the side of upsetting people. The minute you make it bland and you tie a yellow ribbon around it and say, \u2018Actually it\u2019s fine\u2019 ... well, it\u2019s not. That is the reality. The rest of the book may be wishful thinking, but that\u2019s what these children are living through.\u201d Morpurgo resolved to write the book after seeing the body of the three-year-old Syrian boy, Alan Kurdi, washed up on a Turkish beach in September 2015. \u201cJust as when I wrote about the first world war, I don\u2019t want anyone to feel comfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not entertainment. All literature should be, yes, life-enhancing, but troubling \u2013 at the end of the day it should be forcing you to ask questions. But I am sorry if it upsets you too much. Have another sip of beer.\u201d The book\u2019s Brexit and Trump parallels are plain. Morpurgo\u2019s favourite part of the story is when Omar turns a stone wall separating two peoples into a bridge. At one point, Lilliput\u2019s elder stateswoman declares: \u201cWe shall fish together, trade with one another, be friends again as we always were for hundreds of years \u2026 There will be no more walls, no more flags, no more tyrants.\u201d In between sips of pea and ham soup, Morpurgo details his despair with the world. He ranges from the Grenfell Tower fire and Windrush, to the US-Mexico border and Kashmir. And he speaks of his first-hand experience in Gaza and the Calais refugee camp. We have turned, he says, into a \u201cnot-caring society\u201d. He concludes that there is no use pointing the finger at the \u201csupremely arrogant\u201d Boris Johnson. \u201cThis is our fault,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is us. We\u2019ve become a selfish people, an unkind people. I think this thing of kindness is very important. It\u2019s thought to be sort of soft and a bit liberal to be kind. Well, no, it\u2019s not. If someone is starving in the street, you feed them.\u201d Morpurgo believes we\u2019ve become progressively less open-hearted in the century since the first world war, when Britain took in 250,000 Belgian refugees. \u201cWe were at war at the time, our backs against the wall, and I\u2019m sure there were people who moaned about it, but the government took the decision that these people needed help.\u201d By world war two, hearts had hardened. Apart from taking in nearly 10,000 mainly Jewish children, Britain left the rest \u201cto the tender mercies of these ghastly, ghastly tyrants and these fascists, when everyone who cared about these things knew what Hitler might do to the Jewish people.\u201d In the current crisis, it is believed that Britain hasn\u2019t taken in anywhere near the proposed 3,000 child refugees from Europe. Morpurgo detects an empathy gap arising from the fact that, unlike almost every other country on the continent, \u201cfor 1,000 years, we have never been invaded. We do not know what it is like to be chased from our homes.\u201d The 75-year-old also details his anger at the 210,000 homeless children in the UK, some living in shipping containers. \u201cThere are still more than 2,000 children\u2019s homes in this country.

A frequent critic of the education policies of successive governments, he says if he were education secretary he would have children start formal learning at seven, eradicate exam pressure and have universal state education for all; private schools, he says, could be turned into specialist sixth-form colleges. It was in front of the fire in the pub in which we\u2019re sitting that Morpurgo dreamed up War Horse, after a conversation with a veteran of the trenches. \u201cWhen I wrote the book, Clare loved it immediately,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd she\u2019s never said anything was better, which is slightly annoying.\u201d However, it was three decades after publication before Hollywood made miraculous horse Joey world famous.

When O\u2019Rourke called the tweet a death threat, and said it proved that neither Cain nor anyone else should own an AR-15, Cain responded, \u201cYou\u2019re a child, Robert Francis.\u201d O\u2019Rourke endorsed a ban on the possession of certain military-style rifles shortly after the mass shooting last month in his home town of El Paso, Texas, in which 22 people died and dozens were injured. He has specifically called for a mandatory government buyback of AR-15s, following Australia\u2019s gun control model. Cain, who did not respond to an emailed request for comment, appeared to defend his tweet as simply a version of a popular slogan among American gun rights activists \u2013 \u201cCome and take it\u201d \u2013 which generically dares any politician to try to confiscate their guns. In response to thousands of people responding with anger and concern that he was threatening violence against a presidential candidate, the millennial Republican wrote, \u201cI get ratioed in the reg\u201d, meaning that his tweets are regularly overwhelmed with a large ratio of disapproving comments. The Twitter policy that Cain violated, according to a Twitter spokesperson, was the rule that \u201cYou may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people.\u201d The rest of Cain\u2019s Twitter account, including his response calling O\u2019Rourke a child for labeling the tweet a \u201cdeath threat\u201d, remained online Thursday night. The O\u2019Rourke campaign reported the tweet to the FBI, a campaign spokesperson told the Guardian. The campaign declined to offer any additional comment, including any response to Twitter\u2019s decision to take down Cain\u2019s original tweet. Spokespeople for the FBI\u2019s Houston bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday night. Some Twitter users noted that Robert Francis was also the name of Robert F. Kennedy, who was shot dead while running for the Democratic nomination for president in 1968. In 2018, Cain appeared to bring a gun to a Democratic convention in Fort Worth, Texas, as part of a disruptive prank in which he handed out gun control signs.",

The gravest threat to Mexico City\u2019s existence came from a five-year flood starting in 1629, almost causing the city to be abandoned. Ironically now its surrounding lake system has been drained, the greatest threat to the city\u2019s existence is probably the rapid decline of its overstressed aquifers.</p> <p>No wonder water flows through many of Mexico\u2019s City\u2019s unbuilt projects.</p> <p>The first plan to eliminate the city\u2019s lakes while preserving canals and reservoirs for transport and irrigation was proposed by council member Francisco Gudiel in the 16th century. Gudiel\u2019s vision was nixed by a city council unwilling to contribute the necessary funds. The lakes remained for a couple more centuries, disappearing just when the car came on the scene in the early 20th century. When they were finally drained no water was left for irrigation or transport and the city became a rapidly expanding maze of concrete, swamped with motor traffic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7a40cd93d7223b251087b1e0c90b01507da8e4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7a40cd93d7223b251087b1e0c90b01507da8e4f/253_403_6497_3898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Aztlan 2000 project, from 1970, envisaged a huge social housing complex to accommodate migrants to the Mexican capital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Aztlan 2000 project, from 1970, envisaged a huge social housing complex to accommodate migrants to the Mexican capital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Secretaria de Obras Publicas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A ring road surrounding a grid of streets has been a central vision for Mexico City since the first modern urban development plan by Carlos Contreras in 1933.

Areas such as the Tepito and Merced neighbourhoods would have been filled with high-rise social housing for 80,000 people and high-value commerce.

      "bodyText": "Ever since Mexico City was founded on an island in the lake of Texcoco its inhabitants have dreamed of water: containing it, draining it and now retaining it. Nezahualcoyotl, the illustrious lord of Texcoco, made his name constructing a dyke shielding Mexico City\u2019s Aztec predecessor city of Tenochtitlan from flooding. The gravest threat to Mexico City\u2019s existence came from a five-year flood starting in 1629, almost causing the city to be abandoned. Ironically now its surrounding lake system has been drained, the greatest threat to the city\u2019s existence is probably the rapid decline of its overstressed aquifers. No wonder water flows through many of Mexico\u2019s City\u2019s unbuilt projects. The first plan to eliminate the city\u2019s lakes while preserving canals and reservoirs for transport and irrigation was proposed by council member Francisco Gudiel in the 16th century. Gudiel\u2019s vision was nixed by a city council unwilling to contribute the necessary funds. The lakes remained for a couple more centuries, disappearing just when the car came on the scene in the early 20th century. When they were finally drained no water was left for irrigation or transport and the city became a rapidly expanding maze of concrete, swamped with motor traffic. A ring road surrounding a grid of streets has been a central vision for Mexico City since the first modern urban development plan by Carlos Contreras in 1933. One proposal in this vein from Mexico\u2019s ministry of works in 1967 would have heavily impacted the city\u2019s urban landscape with a double ring road surrounding the city\u2019s historic centre, one clockwise and one counterclockwise. Areas such as the Tepito and Merced neighbourhoods would have been filled with high-rise social housing for 80,000 people and high-value commerce. The plan disappeared silently when Mexico was engulfed by student protests in 1968. A 1970 project from the ministry of works, called Aztlan 2000, envisioned the construction of a social housing complex for 1.5 million inhabitants in the city\u2019s northern periphery to accommodate the masses of new migrants coming to the booming megalopolis. The plan integrated housing, malls, a racetrack, hospitals, a zoo, a golf course, a stadium, a subway and a museum, among other amenities. None of these were built and the population of the city\u2019s peripheries rocketed from 591,000 in 1960 to 7.3 million in 1990, largely driven by informal growth. A 2009 project that might have addressed the dearth of services in Mexico City\u2019s periphery was a cross-shaped annex to the prestigious Rufino Tamayo museum for the Atizapan district by Mexican architect Michel Rojkind and Denmark\u2019s Bjarke Ingels Group. The municipality never transferred the land required for the project.

Over the last two years, six states have passed laws similar to Kentucky\u2019s requiring the national motto to be displayed in schools.</p> <p>But the national motto and Bible class bills \u201care like the canaries in the coal mine\u201d, said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re indicators of a larger effort, which has now been spelled out clearly in the Project Blitz strategy to ultimately reach these even more direct attacks on<strong> </strong>religious freedom,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Project Blitz\u2019s <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bd8728e7eb88c68a5c8509f/t/5d365d78339e9100019cfa70/1563843966208/Project+Blitz+Playbook+2018-19.pdf\">playbook</a>, which is distributed to lawmakers, contains samples of cookie cutter legislation for lawmakers to introduce, as well as talking points for them to defend their positions. But in the playbook, the national motto and Bible class bills are only the first steps. Additional pieces of legislation include things like a proclamation of a Christian Heritage Week as well as legislation encouraging discrimination based on gender and sexual identity, such as a resolution \u201cestablishing public policy favoring adoption by intact, heterosexual, marriage-based families\u201d and another \u201cfavoring intimate sexual relations only between married, heterosexual couples\u201d.</p> <p>Americans United says there were 76 bills inspired by Project Blitz introduced in 26 state legislatures in 2018.</p> <p>Colin McNamara, an American Humanist Association staff attorney, calls Project Blitz \u201ca conspiracy with receipts\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s redefining religious liberty. It\u2019s weaponizing religious liberty. It\u2019s turning religious liberty into an unfettered right to discriminate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe end goal of that is by doing that, you marginalize those groups that they don\u2019t want to interact with and you entrench Christian nationalism and Christian privilege.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Christian nationalism goes mainstream</strong></h2> <p>For Christian nationalists, Kentucky is an attractive beachhead, a place where powerful politicians are allies and where the population can be sympathetic. This is a state where it is not uncommon for prayers to be read at high school graduations. It is a state whose Republican governor, Matt Bevin, has encouraged \u201ceach and every\u201d student in the state to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=585656025170852\">participate in a \u201cBring Your Bible To School Day\u201d</a>. It is the same Kentucky where the county clerk Kim Davis became a cause celebre for the Christian right after she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/08/kentucky-clerk-kim-davis-released-from-jail\">refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples</a> in 2015.</p> <p>In Kentucky, a Bible class bill and a national motto bill have been signed into law in recent years.</p> <p>Non-proselytising courses on the Bible were never forbidden in the country \u2013 and indeed, many schools in Kentucky and other states had Bible courses before any such law was passed. Kentucky\u2019s law, like others, called for the creation of state regulations for schools that wanted to offer such a course. But when these bills get signed into law, they are often painted as the end of a prohibition.</p> <p>In endorsing Bible class bills this year, Trump seemed to amplify the sentiment that a prohibition was ending, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1089876055224184833?lang=en\">tweeting</a>: \u201cNumerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible.

But in practice, observers say, these courses are frequently unconstitutional.</p> <p>Analyzing documents obtained through open records requests in 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union found Bible classes at some Kentucky schools were tantamount to Sunday school, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/religious-liberty/religion-and-public-schools/kentucky-public-school-bible-courses-look-more\">writing</a>: \u201cMany public schools that offer such courses purposefully use them as vehicles to proselytize students and involve them in religious activities.\u201d</p> <p>The ACLU found that some classes were using lessons and worksheets taken from Sunday school websites while others used the Bible to impart life lessons and encouraged rote memorization of biblical text.</p> <p>The Barren county high school teacher Todd Steenbergen\u2019s class was flagged by the ACLU for an assignment after a trip to a museum that asked students to write a letter encouraging a friend or family member to visit the museum, focusing their letter on describing an item from a religious exhibit and \u201cwhy the reader needs to appreciate this\u201d. The class was also flagged for a worksheet the ACLU said was only testing students\u2019 knowledge of scripture without \u201cprobing any deeper into an academic or intellectual understanding of the Bible or its influences\u201d.</p> <p>Writing to the Guardian, Steenbergen, who is also an adviser to the high school\u2019s Fellowship of Christian Athletes group and includes a Bible quote in his email signature, said he removes his personal beliefs from the classroom. He compares how he handles the Bible class to how he handles speaking about different presidents as a history teacher.</p> <p>\u201cI am quite confident that I teach in a way that abides by constitutional principles,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not consider my classroom as a different venue to preach a certain message. And, I am not a fan of certain groups/people that want to make it so.\u201d</p> <p>Teaching a Bible class that conforms with the constitution \u201cis doable, but not easy\u201d, says Mark Chancey, a professor of religious studies at Dallas, Texas\u2019s Southern Methodist University and an expert on public school Bible classes.</p> <p>A lot of it comes down to training: a teacher may know the Bible, but if they have never studied it academically they could be prone to injecting their own biases and presenting parts as truth. Well-meaning teachers can also stumble upon curricula and course materials that were designed to evangelize.</p> <p>\u201cBut there are definitely, unfortunately, some teachers who see [Bible classes] as a trojan horse to bring in their own ideology,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>But there are definitely, unfortunately, some teachers who see [Bible classes] as a trojan horse to bring in their own ideology.</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Chancey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Concerns over the constitutionality of Bible classes can weigh heavily on teachers. At Anderson County High School in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, the social studies teacher Corey Sayre pushed back against a scheduled Bible class he had volunteered to teach this year, eventually getting the school to replace it with a comparative religion class.</p> <p>Sayre, a religious Catholic who goes to church every week, told the Guardian that while he believed he could teach the course within the confines of the constitution, it was something that would necessitate careful and constant attention. He also saw potential perils in teaching a non-devotional course.</p> <p>\u201cI knew that teaching this within the confines of the first amendment was going to necessitate a critical examination that most parents would not love,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that I was going to get killed from both sides.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Schools push back</strong></h2> <p>When the Republican state representative Brandon Reed introduced legislation requiring \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d be posted in Kentucky public schools last year, he made it clear that it was about getting God back in school.</p> <p>\u201cIn a time of rampant drug use, increased school violence, and mounting cases of suicide among our youth, we need God in our schools now more than ever,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One year later and the words \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d are now emblazoned in large, imposing letters over doorways and embossed on plaques in school lobbies.</p> <p>But in some school districts, there are signs of resistance.</p> <p>In Fayette county, Kentucky\u2019s second-largest school district, administrators decided to comply with the law by displaying enlarged $1 bills, which include the national motto.</p> <p>At Jefferson county public schools, the state\u2019s largest district with 169 schools in the Louisville area, administrators complied with the law by hanging up small posters offering more of a history lesson than a proclamation.</p> <p>\u201cThe phrase \u2018In God We Trust\u2019 first appeared on US coins in 1864, largely because of increased religious sentiment during the civil war,\u201d small text reads on posters featuring the American flag and Statue of Liberty in the background. \u201cThe phrase later became the national motto and, in 1957, made it onto printed US bills.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the superintendent of LaRue County public schools \u2013 Reed\u2019s county and the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln \u2013 told the Guardian that its schools were hanging images of oversized pennies, which feature the words \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d above Honest Abe\u2019s head.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When students returned to Kentucky public schools last month after summer vacation, they may have noticed something different: the words \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d displayed in a prominent location in their school, as is now mandated by law. Kentucky\u2019s law could seem innocuous enough; after all, the words are the national motto and appear on American currency. But its critics say it is part of something bigger: a concerted, nationwide push by conservative Christian nationalist groups to inject religion into society and chisel away at the wall between church and state. The legislative effort Project Blitz is a coalition of three Christian nationalist groups, including the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation, which aims to \u201cprotect religious freedom, preserve America\u2019s Judeo-Christian heritage and promote prayer\u201d. In recent years, Project Blitz has pushed for state lawmakers to introduce bills like the \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d one, as well as bills encouraging elective Bible classes in public schools. Over the last two years, six states have passed laws similar to Kentucky\u2019s requiring the national motto to be displayed in schools. But the national motto and Bible class bills \u201care like the canaries in the coal mine\u201d, said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. \u201cThey\u2019re indicators of a larger effort, which has now been spelled out clearly in the Project Blitz strategy to ultimately reach these even more direct attacks on religious freedom,\u201d she said. Project Blitz\u2019s playbook, which is distributed to lawmakers, contains samples of cookie cutter legislation for lawmakers to introduce, as well as talking points for them to defend their positions. But in the playbook, the national motto and Bible class bills are only the first steps. Additional pieces of legislation include things like a proclamation of a Christian Heritage Week as well as legislation encouraging discrimination based on gender and sexual identity, such as a resolution \u201cestablishing public policy favoring adoption by intact, heterosexual, marriage-based families\u201d and another \u201cfavoring intimate sexual relations only between married, heterosexual couples\u201d. Americans United says there were 76 bills inspired by Project Blitz introduced in 26 state legislatures in 2018. Colin McNamara, an American Humanist Association staff attorney, calls Project Blitz \u201ca conspiracy with receipts\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s redefining religious liberty. It\u2019s weaponizing religious liberty. It\u2019s turning religious liberty into an unfettered right to discriminate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe end goal of that is by doing that, you marginalize those groups that they don\u2019t want to interact with and you entrench Christian nationalism and Christian privilege.\u201d Christian nationalism goes mainstream For Christian nationalists, Kentucky is an attractive beachhead, a place where powerful politicians are allies and where the population can be sympathetic. This is a state where it is not uncommon for prayers to be read at high school graduations. It is a state whose Republican governor, Matt Bevin, has encouraged \u201ceach and every\u201d student in the state to participate in a \u201cBring Your Bible To School Day\u201d. It is the same Kentucky where the county clerk Kim Davis became a cause celebre for the Christian right after she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in 2015. In Kentucky, a Bible class bill and a national motto bill have been signed into law in recent years. Non-proselytising courses on the Bible were never forbidden in the country \u2013 and indeed, many schools in Kentucky and other states had Bible courses before any such law was passed. Kentucky\u2019s law, like others, called for the creation of state regulations for schools that wanted to offer such a course. But when these bills get signed into law, they are often painted as the end of a prohibition. In endorsing Bible class bills this year, Trump seemed to amplify the sentiment that a prohibition was ending, tweeting: \u201cNumerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible. Starting to make a turn back? Great!\u201d McNamara says people like Trump and Bevin have made Christian nationalism \u2013 \u201cthe belief that this nation is and ought to be Christian\u201d, as he puts it \u2013 mainstream at a time when white Christians are a minority in America. \u201cThat used to be something that was a fringe rightwing belief,\u201d he said. But \u201cit has become a rallying cry for the rightwing in this country now. And it\u2019s become this grand project.\u201d In its playbook, Project Blitz acknowledges legislation like national motto bills are meant to pave the way for more ambitious goals. \u201cDespite arguments that this type of legislation is not needed, measures such as the \u2018In God We Trust\u2019 bill can have enormous impact,\u201d reads one section. \u201cEven if it does not become law, it can still provide the basis to shore up later support for other governmental entities to support religious displays.\u201d Bible classes running afoul of constitution Bible class laws in Kentucky and other states require the courses not proselytize or endorse or disparage any one religion. But in practice, observers say, these courses are frequently unconstitutional. Analyzing documents obtained through open records requests in 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union found Bible classes at some Kentucky schools were tantamount to Sunday school, writing: \u201cMany public schools that offer such courses purposefully use them as vehicles to proselytize students and involve them in religious activities.\u201d The ACLU found that some classes were using lessons and worksheets taken from Sunday school websites while others used the Bible to impart life lessons and encouraged rote memorization of biblical text. The Barren county high school teacher Todd Steenbergen\u2019s class was flagged by the ACLU for an assignment after a trip to a museum that asked students to write a letter encouraging a friend or family member to visit the museum, focusing their letter on describing an item from a religious exhibit and \u201cwhy the reader needs to appreciate this\u201d. The class was also flagged for a worksheet the ACLU said was only testing students\u2019 knowledge of scripture without \u201cprobing any deeper into an academic or intellectual understanding of the Bible or its influences\u201d. Writing to the Guardian, Steenbergen, who is also an adviser to the high school\u2019s Fellowship of Christian Athletes group and includes a Bible quote in his email signature, said he removes his personal beliefs from the classroom. He compares how he handles the Bible class to how he handles speaking about different presidents as a history teacher. \u201cI am quite confident that I teach in a way that abides by constitutional principles,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not consider my classroom as a different venue to preach a certain message. And, I am not a fan of certain groups/people that want to make it so.\u201d Teaching a Bible class that conforms with the constitution \u201cis doable, but not easy\u201d, says Mark Chancey, a professor of religious studies at Dallas, Texas\u2019s Southern Methodist University and an expert on public school Bible classes. A lot of it comes down to training: a teacher may know the Bible, but if they have never studied it academically they could be prone to injecting their own biases and presenting parts as truth. Well-meaning teachers can also stumble upon curricula and course materials that were designed to evangelize. \u201cBut there are definitely, unfortunately, some teachers who see [Bible classes] as a trojan horse to bring in their own ideology,\u201d he said. Concerns over the constitutionality of Bible classes can weigh heavily on teachers. At Anderson County High School in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, the social studies teacher Corey Sayre pushed back against a scheduled Bible class he had volunteered to teach this year, eventually getting the school to replace it with a comparative religion class. Sayre, a religious Catholic who goes to church every week, told the Guardian that while he believed he could teach the course within the confines of the constitution, it was something that would necessitate careful and constant attention. He also saw potential perils in teaching a non-devotional course. \u201cI knew that teaching this within the confines of the first amendment was going to necessitate a critical examination that most parents would not love,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that I was going to get killed from both sides.\u201d Schools push back When the Republican state representative Brandon Reed introduced legislation requiring \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d be posted in Kentucky public schools last year, he made it clear that it was about getting God back in school. \u201cIn a time of rampant drug use, increased school violence, and mounting cases of suicide among our youth, we need God in our schools now more than ever,\u201d he said. One year later and the words \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d are now emblazoned in large, imposing letters over doorways and embossed on plaques in school lobbies. But in some school districts, there are signs of resistance. In Fayette county, Kentucky\u2019s second-largest school district, administrators decided to comply with the law by displaying enlarged $1 bills, which include the national motto. At Jefferson county public schools, the state\u2019s largest district with 169 schools in the Louisville area, administrators complied with the law by hanging up small posters offering more of a history lesson than a proclamation. \u201cThe phrase \u2018In God We Trust\u2019 first appeared on US coins in 1864, largely because of increased religious sentiment during the civil war,\u201d small text reads on posters featuring the American flag and Statue of Liberty in the background. \u201cThe phrase later became the national motto and, in 1957, made it onto printed US bills.\u201d Meanwhile, the superintendent of LaRue County public schools \u2013 Reed\u2019s county and the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln \u2013 told the Guardian that its schools were hanging images of oversized pennies, which feature the words \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d above Honest Abe\u2019s head.",

She was also accused of benefiting from \u201cpassing privilege\u201d because she is a conventionally attractive white woman. The backlash was so bad that Wynn deleted her Twitter account. The anger doesn\u2019t appear to have abated \u2013 this week, rumours that Wynn has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=contrapoints%20doxxed&amp;src=typeahead_click\">doxxed</a> started circulating.</p> <h2><strong>The politicization of pronouns</strong></h2> <p>Little attention used to be paid to pronouns. In recent years, however, they have become a cornerstone of the culture wars.</p> <p>Pronoun preferences are a favourite joke among unimaginative reactionaries who use them as proof that \u201csnowflake millennials\u201d just want to feel special. In <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/lgbtq-comedians-respond-to-dave-chappelles-sticks-and-stones/\">Dave Chappelle\u2019s latest Netflix stand-up special</a>, for example, he jokes: \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on, fellas? Lady. Whatever pronoun makes you feel comfortable in the back.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, pronoun introductions have become an established feature of some progressive spaces and university campuses. Many view this as a positive step towards a more nuanced understanding of gender. As Darius Hickman, a 23-year-old non-binary poet in New York says, these introductions mean people who don\u2019t conform to traditional views of binary gender don\u2019t feel alienated.</p> <p>\u201cRelying on clocking people\u2019s gender based on appearances is harmful, especially since some people \u2013 oftentimes non-binary folks \u2013 can happen to look strictly binary, and a simple pronoun check makes things easier for everyone, including folks whose gender isn\u2019t easy to tell.\u201d</p> <p>But when gender is so complex and personal, is there really any such thing as a \u201csimple\u201d pronoun check?</p> <p>At this stage, I should probably note that although I identify as a Progressive Lesbian\u2122, the pressure of pronoun introductions often makes me feel uncomfortable. Actively announcing myself as a she/her makes it seem like I\u2019m making my entire identity about my gender, which feels regressive.</p> <p>Further, while pronoun introductions are supposed to be about recognizing that gender is complex, it sometimes seems as though they \u2013 paradoxically \u2013 reinforce gender binaries. Announcing yourself as a \u201cshe\u201d, \u201che\u201d or \u201cthey\u201d would appear to buy into the notion that a \u201che\u201d is completely different from a \u201cshe\u201d \u2013&#xa0;and if you don\u2019t subscribe to traditional gender roles you should identify yourself as a \u201cthey\u201d.</p> <p>Wouldn\u2019t it be better if we just worked towards a future where \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d weren\u2019t weighted with so much meaning? What if we worked to break those limitations down instead?</p> <p>Perhaps. But, notes Lal Zimman, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara who focusses on the linguistic practices of LGBQT speakers, we can\u2019t escape the fact that pronouns play an important role in how we see the world. Like it or not, \u201cwe tend to take a lot of social cues from pronouns. Even hearing a pronoun in a sentence can make you picture someone very differently.\u201d Being more mindful about them \u201cchallenges people\u2019s ideas about how gender works in a fundamental way\u201d.</p> <p>That isn\u2019t to say that pronoun introductions are entirely without difficulty. \u201cI think Wynn is absolutely right that people engage with that practice in ways that can be somewhat problematic,\u201d Zimman says. Sometimes pronoun introductions only happen when a gender non-conforming person is in the room, for example. Naturally, that person can feel singled out. In Zimman\u2019s view, you solve this problem by normalizing pronoun introduction so everyone is clear it is standard and hasn\u2019t been rolled out specifically for them.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just people feeling singled out that is potentially problematic, however; pronoun introductions can be uncomfortable for people who are still figuring out their gender identity. Rachel Levin, a professor at Pomona College, has observed this on a number of occasions among her students, inspiring her to write a piece for <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2018/09/19/why-asking-students-their-preferred-pronoun-not-good-idea-opinion\">Inside Higher Ed</a> last year that suggested \u201casking everyone their preferred personal pronoun is not a good idea\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/11/the-confidence-gap-what-attitudes-to-meeting-aliens-reveal-about-the-sexes\">The confidence gap: what attitudes to meeting aliens reveal about the sexes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cUndergrads are often still in the process of finding themselves,\u201d Levin says. They\u2019re often still a work in progress. Pronoun introductions can \u201cforce people to out themselves or lie in a room full of strangers. Let\u2019s not make the most marginalized people in the room feel uncomfortable by posing as allies.\u201d</p> <p>Levin doesn\u2019t avoid the issue of pronouns altogether. \u201cI usually make some statements to the class about the importance of pronouns and why I\u2019m not asking,\u201d she explains, \u201cso that allyship and responsibility is signaled and nobody is made uncomfortable.\u201d She also emails students before the class begins asking them to let her know if they have any concerns about correct pronoun usage, or if their name hasn\u2019t been officially recorded.</p> <h2><strong>Is \u2018they\u2019 the answer to the pronoun problem?</strong></h2> <p>What about the growing popularity of the singular \u201cthey\u201d? About one in five Americans say they personally know someone who prefers a gender-neutral pronoun like \u201cthey\u201d rather than he/she, according to a <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/#generations-differ-in-their-familiarity-and-comfort-with-using-gender-neutral-pronouns\">Pew Research Center survey</a> conducted in fall 2018. They has become so mainstream that, earlier this year, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/opinion/pronoun-they-gender.html\">New York Times op-ed columnist</a> announced that we should all move away \u201cfrom the stifling prison of gender expectations\u201d and use \u201cthey\u201d.</p> <p>This may seem like a neat way of avoiding pronoun problems, but it is reductive. Professor Grace Lavery at UC Berkley notes that \u201cpeople outside the trans community tend to assume that \u2018they\u2019 is a catch-all \u2013 but it isn\u2019t. For plenty of trans and non-binary people, \u2018they\u2019 has very concrete and distinctive meanings. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a generalizable term. Additionally, for binary trans people, \u2018they\u2019 is often a place where we get stuck \u2013 people prepared to acknowledge some of our transition, but not all of it. Assuming pronouns in advance, even neutral ones, can lead to significant problems.\u201d</p> <p>Zimman echoes this, explaining that a blanket use of \u201cthey\u201d doesn\u2019t align with the idea that people should have some agency in how they are referred to. \u201cI like to think of someone\u2019s pronouns in a similar way to how I\u2019d think about their name. You can\u2019t just look at someone and say, \u2018Hey, you look like a Stephanie \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to call you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe manage to learn a lot of names over the course of our lives,\u201d Zimman adds. \u201cWe learn names that are unusual or hard to pronounce. We recognize that\u2019s just part of being a human being and having positive relationships with other humans. I\u2019d like to see the same attitude applied to pronouns.\u201d</p> <p>At this stage I should probably wrap everything up with a tidy conclusion. But I think the key message is that there are no tidy conclusions \u2013 other than the fact that we should treat each other with kindness and respect.</p> <p>Gender is messy and complicated and incredibly emotional. Pronouns are personal, and everybody\u2019s relationship with them is different. Which, I think, is sort of what Wynn was trying to say before she was cancelled.</p>",

Many view this as a positive step towards a more nuanced understanding of gender. As Darius Hickman, a 23-year-old non-binary poet in New York says, these introductions mean people who don\u2019t conform to traditional views of binary gender don\u2019t feel alienated. \u201cRelying on clocking people\u2019s gender based on appearances is harmful, especially since some people \u2013 oftentimes non-binary folks \u2013 can happen to look strictly binary, and a simple pronoun check makes things easier for everyone, including folks whose gender isn\u2019t easy to tell.\u201d But when gender is so complex and personal, is there really any such thing as a \u201csimple\u201d pronoun check? At this stage, I should probably note that although I identify as a Progressive Lesbian\u2122, the pressure of pronoun introductions often makes me feel uncomfortable. Actively announcing myself as a she/her makes it seem like I\u2019m making my entire identity about my gender, which feels regressive. Further, while pronoun introductions are supposed to be about recognizing that gender is complex, it sometimes seems as though they \u2013 paradoxically \u2013 reinforce gender binaries. Announcing yourself as a \u201cshe\u201d, \u201che\u201d or \u201cthey\u201d would appear to buy into the notion that a \u201che\u201d is completely different from a \u201cshe\u201d \u2013 and if you don\u2019t subscribe to traditional gender roles you should identify yourself as a \u201cthey\u201d. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if we just worked towards a future where \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d weren\u2019t weighted with so much meaning? What if we worked to break those limitations down instead? Perhaps. But, notes Lal Zimman, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara who focusses on the linguistic practices of LGBQT speakers, we can\u2019t escape the fact that pronouns play an important role in how we see the world. Like it or not, \u201cwe tend to take a lot of social cues from pronouns. Even hearing a pronoun in a sentence can make you picture someone very differently.\u201d Being more mindful about them \u201cchallenges people\u2019s ideas about how gender works in a fundamental way\u201d. That isn\u2019t to say that pronoun introductions are entirely without difficulty. \u201cI think Wynn is absolutely right that people engage with that practice in ways that can be somewhat problematic,\u201d Zimman says. Sometimes pronoun introductions only happen when a gender non-conforming person is in the room, for example. Naturally, that person can feel singled out. In Zimman\u2019s view, you solve this problem by normalizing pronoun introduction so everyone is clear it is standard and hasn\u2019t been rolled out specifically for them. It\u2019s not just people feeling singled out that is potentially problematic, however; pronoun introductions can be uncomfortable for people who are still figuring out their gender identity. Rachel Levin, a professor at Pomona College, has observed this on a number of occasions among her students, inspiring her to write a piece for Inside Higher Ed last year that suggested \u201casking everyone their preferred personal pronoun is not a good idea\u201d. \u201cUndergrads are often still in the process of finding themselves,\u201d Levin says. They\u2019re often still a work in progress. Pronoun introductions can \u201cforce people to out themselves or lie in a room full of strangers. Let\u2019s not make the most marginalized people in the room feel uncomfortable by posing as allies.\u201d Levin doesn\u2019t avoid the issue of pronouns altogether. \u201cI usually make some statements to the class about the importance of pronouns and why I\u2019m not asking,\u201d she explains, \u201cso that allyship and responsibility is signaled and nobody is made uncomfortable.\u201d She also emails students before the class begins asking them to let her know if they have any concerns about correct pronoun usage, or if their name hasn\u2019t been officially recorded. Is \u2018they\u2019 the answer to the pronoun problem? What about the growing popularity of the singular \u201cthey\u201d? About one in five Americans say they personally know someone who prefers a gender-neutral pronoun like \u201cthey\u201d rather than he/she, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in fall 2018. They has become so mainstream that, earlier this year, a New York Times op-ed columnist announced that we should all move away \u201cfrom the stifling prison of gender expectations\u201d and use \u201cthey\u201d. This may seem like a neat way of avoiding pronoun problems, but it is reductive. Professor Grace Lavery at UC Berkley notes that \u201cpeople outside the trans community tend to assume that \u2018they\u2019 is a catch-all \u2013 but it isn\u2019t. For plenty of trans and non-binary people, \u2018they\u2019 has very concrete and distinctive meanings. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a generalizable term. Additionally, for binary trans people, \u2018they\u2019 is often a place where we get stuck \u2013 people prepared to acknowledge some of our transition, but not all of it. Assuming pronouns in advance, even neutral ones, can lead to significant problems.\u201d Zimman echoes this, explaining that a blanket use of \u201cthey\u201d doesn\u2019t align with the idea that people should have some agency in how they are referred to. \u201cI like to think of someone\u2019s pronouns in a similar way to how I\u2019d think about their name. You can\u2019t just look at someone and say, \u2018Hey, you look like a Stephanie \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to call you.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe manage to learn a lot of names over the course of our lives,\u201d Zimman adds. \u201cWe learn names that are unusual or hard to pronounce. We recognize that\u2019s just part of being a human being and having positive relationships with other humans. I\u2019d like to see the same attitude applied to pronouns.\u201d At this stage I should probably wrap everything up with a tidy conclusion. But I think the key message is that there are no tidy conclusions \u2013 other than the fact that we should treat each other with kindness and respect. Gender is messy and complicated and incredibly emotional. Pronouns are personal, and everybody\u2019s relationship with them is different. Which, I think, is sort of what Wynn was trying to say before she was cancelled.",

      "bodyText": "Economists and academics have warned that the Coalition\u2019s controversial industrial relations bill would keep wages stagnant by further eroding collective bargaining. John Quiggin, Jim Stanford and Anthony Forsyth told the Senate education and employment committee on Friday that the Coalition\u2019s ensuring integrity bill would further skew negotiating outcomes in favour of employers. The bill would give new powers to the federal court to make orders about the governance of unions and allow employers to request the deregistration or disqualification of union officials for breaches of industrial law. Unions have been engaged in a counterattack over the parliamentary sitting fortnight, warning senators not to pass a bill that while ostensibly targeted at the CFMMEU and its controversial Victorian official John Setka would have wide-ranging impacts on all unions. The Coalition is just one Senate vote away from passing the bill putting senator Jacqui Lambie, who has linked her support to Setka quitting, and Centre Alliance in the box seat. At a committee inquiry hearing on Friday the Centre Alliance flagged further amendments to the bill aimed at prevent its misuse by employers seeking to improve their bargaining position. Quiggin, an economist at the University of Queensland, told the inquiry the bill is \u201cclearly directed at reducing the power of unions\u201d which would \u201cput further downward pressure on wages. Stanford, an economist and the director of the Centre for Future Work, said it was \u201cabsolutely wrong\u201d to claim there is a \u201cculture of lawlessness\u201d and \u201crecidivism\u201d in unions, as Coalition critics have done. Stanford said Australia has a \u201cuniquely intrusive\u201d regime of regulation on unions, putting unions in breach of industrial laws for \u201call kinds of activities that would be considered normal \u2026 in other countries such as industrial action, recruiting members, holding protests, challenging unfair employer actions, and displaying union badges\u201d. Forsyth, a professor of labour law at RMIT, noted that the bill went even further than recommendations of the Trade Union Royal Commission, which considered deregistration only for the CFMMEU, not other unions. Forsyth noted the government was seeking to narrow the federal court\u2019s discretion to refuse deregistration applications, despite the fact it has not attempted to use existing deregistration powers in industrial law against the CFMMEU. In an inquiry hearing in Brisbane, Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick proposed a number of changes to the ensuring integrity bill. Patrick suggested the concern could be addressed by limiting the powers to apply for disqualification and deregistration to independent regulators. Removing the power for employers to seek disqualification comes on top of Patrick\u2019s earlier demand that the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, should not have such a power. Patrick told the hearing he was \u201cabsolutely convinced that there is a need to deal with the sort of misconduct that the federal court has found the [Construction Forestry Mining Maritime and Energy Union] has engaged in\u201d. \u201cIf I accept the current bill is a sledgehammer being used to crack a nut, what I\u2019m most interested in is how to make the current bill a nutcracker.\u201d Patrick queried why the bill currently requires the federal court to deregister a union with an adverse finding against it unless it would be \u201cunjust\u201d to do so, suggesting this could be replaced by a discretion that the court \u201cmay\u201d deregister a union or disqualify an official. Guardian Australia understands Centre Alliance is also considering requiring courts to consider the gravity of breaches when assessing applications, to fix union concerns that trivial breaches of technical requirements such as lodging annual returns or failing to return right of entry permits could ground vexatious employer applications.",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Speaker swings behind written constitution Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to help you over the line and into the weekend. John Bercow has promised that he will be prepared to rip up the parliamentary rulebook to stop any illegal attempt by Boris Johnson to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. The Commons Speaker, who announced that he is standing down next month, has been a thorn in the side of hardline Conservative MPs throughout the Brexit process. Delivering the Bingham lecture in London last night, Bercow said he would permit \u201cadditional procedural creativity\u201d if necessary to allow parliament to block the prime minister from ignoring the law. He warned: \u201cThe only form of Brexit that we have, whenever that might be, will be a Brexit that the House of Commons has explicitly endorsed.\u201d Bercow also said that the Brexit imbroglio had exposed weaknesses in the political system and he was now persuaded that a royal commission was needed to examine whether a written constitution was needed. The Speaker\u2019s intervention came as Johnson was forced to deny accusations that he misled the Queen over the reasons for proroguing parliament this week and as MPs condemned the government\u2019s \u201cGet ready for Brexit\u201d ad campaign as \u201cmisleading\u201d. And in case you need to remind yourself of how we got here, Jon Henley traces the long road to the crisis of the past 10 days. * * * Democrats clash \u2013 Joe Biden has clashed on the issue of healthcare with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, his leading rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, in the latest debate between the candidates. Biden, who was vice-president under Barack Obama for eight years, defended the administration\u2019s Obamacare scheme and challenged his rivals to spell out how they pay for their plans to provide healthcare for all and eliminate private insurance. Questions about gun violence, immigration and trade also revealed a difference of opinion and strong criticism of president Donald Trump. Richard Wolffe reckons Biden was the best \u2013 and worst \u2013 on the stage in Houston, while Tom McCarthy says the former vice-president fumbled his facts. You can read exactly how it all unfolded on our live blog here. * * * Disease risk \u2013 Almost 100,000 people in Britain are at risk of dying because they do not know they have the liver disease hepatitis C. Around 95,600 people, mainly drug users, are thought to have the disease but are unaware of the condition because they have not been diagnosed, Public Health England warns today. Steve Mowle, of the Royal College of GPs, said the figures were \u201cextremely concerning\u201d and called the situation a \u201csignificant public health risk\u201d. Nine in 10 people infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) inject recreational drugs such as heroin or have done so. The virus is spread among drug users by sharing contaminated needles. * * * Knife killing \u2013 A man has died and another has been taken to hospital after a double stabbing in Camden High Street in north-west London. Police said they were called to the area, which has many pubs and clubs, shortly after 11pm last night. They found a man suffering from a stab wound but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Another man in his 20s was found nearby with a knife wound and was taken to hospital. It is the latest in a series of knife killings to blight the capital this year. * * * Tunnel vision \u2013 It is rated one of the most endangered Victorian buildings in Britain. But campaigners fear that an abandoned railway tunnel hundreds of feet under the Pennines could be lost to the nation if Department of Transport officials get their way and are allowed to fill it with concrete. Heritage groups instead want to restore the 1.4-mile tunnel, which was built to link Halifax and Keighley in 1878, and turn it into a cycle path as Yorkshire seeks to secure its place as \u201cthe beating heart of British cycling\u201d. * * * Mail models \u2013 A study of French postmen\u2019s testicles and a nappy-changing machine were among the winners of this year\u2019s Ig Nobel awards, the alternative science prizes that aim to \u201cfirst make people laugh, and then make them think\u201d.

He had surprisingly little time to go after the oligarchy, but he got in this lick: \u201cWe must and will defeat Trump, the most dangerous president in the history of this country. But we must do more. This country is moving into an oligarchic form of society. As president I am prepared to take them on.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was the first to refer to \u201cthe catastrophic crisis of climate change\u201d.

But no one else did.</p> \n<h2><strong>Andrew Yang</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>In a phrase: take my money</strong></p> \n<p>Yang had promised to make history Thursday night, and he did it \u2013 kind of? \u2013 by using his opening remarks to announce a raffle on his web site in which 10 lucky families would get $1,000 a month for a year. Yang is campaigning for universal basic income, so the giveaway wasn\u2019t as totally out of left field \u2013 or like, as bribe-y \u2013 as it might seem. But did he win converts? He was upbeat and cracked jokes that did not always land, such as when during a health care discussion he said, \u201cI\u2019m Asian, so I know a lot of doctors.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>In a phrase: hell yes</strong></p> \n<p>O\u2019Rourke, whose hometown of El Paso, Texas, suffered a mass shooting that killed 22 people at a Walmart last month, did not shy away from a direct question about whether he would confiscate assault rifles. \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he said, which according to conventional American political wisdom used to mean political death, but the reaction in the hall didn\u2019t sound that way.</p> \n<p>He also said, \u201cWe have a white supremacist in the White House, and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.\u201d He also spoke some Spanish. So in terms of telling it like it is, as far as progressive Democrats are concerned \u2013 O\u2019Rourke delivered.</p> \n<h2><strong>Former secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>In a phrase: coming for Joe</strong></p> \n<p>Castro delivered what might be the single most memorable moment from the debate, in which he accused Biden of having forgotten what the former vice-president had said minutes earlier, in a point about whether families would have to opt into his health care plan.</p> \n<p>\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro asked Biden. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re forgetting what you said two minutes ago!\u201d</p> \n<p>The transcript seemed to vindicate Biden, and the moment bordered on ugly. But the question of whether Castro had succeeded in defining the frontrunner as, for lack of a better word, maybe senile, was an open one.</p> \n<p>Castro had other memorable lines, including, \u201cDonald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants,\u201d and a separate attack on Biden: \u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work but not have to answer to any questions.\u201d</p>",

The Victorian Society on Friday threw its weight behind a campaign to bring new life to the 1.4-mile (2.3km) Queensbury tunnel. The charity listed the tunnel in its annual top 10 of the most endangered Victorian and Edwardian buildings, which also includes a crumbling country mansion in Norfolk, an architecturally unusual church in Warrington and an Arts and Crafts pub in Croydon. The railway tunnel was built by the Great Northern Railway for its line between Halifax and Keighley and was the longest tunnel on the company\u2019s network when it opened in 1878. Passenger and freight services on the line were stopped in the 1950s and it is currently abandoned and flooded. Campaigners want the tunnel to be restored as a cycle path, the centrepiece of a new network linking Halifax and Bradford. The Department for Transport wants to fill in sections of the tunnel with concrete and leave it to collapse.

Within a day \u2013 after widespread criticism \u2013 there were suggestions that the job title would be revised, but the intended message was clear. What supposedly threatens the \u201cEuropean way of life\u201d, according to the commission, is migration \u2013 the new role incorporates the duties of the previous migration commissioner, bundling together the responsibility for controlling Europe\u2019s external borders with security, employment and education.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8f488fd5-49a1-48a2-96f2-0edc9ffce51e\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ursula von der Leyen, born in 1958, is the daughter of Heidi and Ernst Albrecht, the latter having been a senior politician in the centre-right Christian Democratic Union who rose to be governor of the state of Lower Saxony.</p>\n    <p>She spent the first 12 years of her life in Brussels, where her father was serving as a commission official. She studied economics at the universities of G\u00f6ttingen and M\u00fcnster before attending the London School of Economics where she used the pseudonym Rose Ladson because she was seen as a potential target for West German leftwing extremists.</p>\n    <p>Von der Leyen then read for a medical degree, becoming a gynaecologist, and only entered politics at 42. A mother of seven, she has held government positions as labour and family affairs minister, driving forward key policies on gender quotas for company boards and improved maternity and paternity pay and rights \u2013 policies that initially won her considerable popularity.</p>\n    <p>In 2011, Von der Leyen spoke of her desire for a \u201cUnited States of Europe along the lines of federal states like Switzerland,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a>&nbsp;or the US\u201d. She has since claimed that Brexit, and the loss of the \u201cpragmatism\u201d of the British in the EU, should propel the bloc towards further integration, and has voiced support for a European army.</p>\n    <p>She is a key ally of Angela Merkel, with whom she has worked since 2005. Like Merkel, she has championed the idea of a close relationship between the EU and UK after Brexit.<br></p>\n    <p>Von der Leyen, though, has been withering about those who campaigned for Brexit, Describing events since the referendum as a \u201cburst bubble of hollow promises \u2026 inflated by populists\u201d.

What unique, homogenous culture is shared by people who live in Bolton, Palermo or Plovdiv \u2013 but not those who live outside Europe? And what threatens it so profoundly that the European Union has this week nominated a minister with responsibility for defending it? Just asking these questions shows what a fatuous and deeply sinister stunt it was for the incoming president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to unveil a new role on Tuesday: vice-president for protecting the European way of life. Within a day \u2013 after widespread criticism \u2013 there were suggestions that the job title would be revised, but the intended message was clear. What supposedly threatens the \u201cEuropean way of life\u201d, according to the commission, is migration \u2013 the new role incorporates the duties of the previous migration commissioner, bundling together the responsibility for controlling Europe\u2019s external borders with security, employment and education. There will be resistance to this new framing: as the Dutch liberal MEP Sophie in \u2018t Veld told the Independent this week, \u201cThe very point about the European way of life, is the freedom for individuals to choose their own way of life\u2026 The implication that Europeans need to be protected from external cultures is grotesque and this narrative should be rejected.\u201d Others pointed out that the commission\u2019s choice of words echoed the far right, borrowing from those who suggest that immigration places European, Christian civilisation in mortal danger.

      "body": "<p>A general election is now more or less certain, the only remaining question is, \u201cHow soon?\u201d We know where we want to go but we\u2019d rather not be starting from here. If the aim is not just to deny Boris Johnson a majority, but to get rid of the Conservatives as the party of government altogether, the best scenario would be Labour polling high, having created a solid anti-Brexit, anti-hard right, anti-austerity tripod.</p> <p>That hasn\u2019t happened, but a progressive alliance is still more than capable of having a decisive impact. Nigel Farage says a pact between his Brexit party and the Tories would make them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/brexit-party-farage-seeks-election-pact-with-conservatives\" title=\"\">\u201cunstoppable\u201d</a>. Yet the focus on Johnson\u2019s ability to ally with Farage is misplaced. The Conservatives and the Brexit party will certainly pull together; the only unknown is how many core Tory values the prime minister is prepared to traduce to get there, which is hardly unknown at all.</p> <p>A progressive alliance, on the other hand, would be much more fragile and its conclusions less foregone. The fundamental block is the Labour party \u2013 obsessed with vote share, it has always opposed alliances of any kind. In 2017, if it had stood aside in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/30/labour-figures-call-for-candidates-to-step-aside-for-greens-in-two-seats\" title=\"\">Isle of Wight</a> \u2013 bear in mind that this seat has never returned a Labour MP \u2013 the Greens would have repaid them in 12 other constituencies. But no dice, then, and advisers around Jeremy Corbyn were scornful about the successful alliances made between the Greens and the Liberal Democrats, on the basis that their main impact had been to reduce the Green vote share (cut by half on the 2015 election).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You expect a progressive alliance to look scrappy, patchworked, cobbled-together. But when it works, it often looks more like a landslide</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While Labour frontbenchers talk constantly to Liberal Democrats \u2013 indeed, last week\u2019s parliamentary victories couldn\u2019t have been won without a fair amount of talking to Tories \u2013 nobody at shadow cabinet level is talking about pacts. Emily Thornberry can just about hear the word \u201calliance\u201d without recoiling, but even she \u2013 pragmatic, in a 70% remain constituency \u2013 is not practically seeking one.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have erected their own barriers, mainly in the form of their performative hostility towards Labour. Their full revoke stance, adopted this week, is not a meaningful contribution to the Brexit process, unless they believe they\u2019ll win an election outright \u2013 in which case they have taken leave of their senses. Rather, it\u2019s designed to underscore their superiority over the Labour party, in the eyes of hard remainers; entirely speciously, since they know they\u2019ll never be called out on it.</p> <p>Taken together with the much friendlier noises they make to Tory defectors than to anyone in the Labour hierarchy, it is hard to perceive much warmth between the two blocs. However, this is mostly strategic; it will help both the Lib Dems and Labour if remainer Tories \u2013 has any group ever been so politically homeless? \u2013 find somewhere to cast their votes, otherwise that\u2019s a 4 million-strong army of silence. It would be much harder for them to vote for Jo Swinson\u2019s party were it seen to be chummy with Corbyn\u2019s, and the smarter elements of Labour take their catcalls with a pinch of salt.</p> <p>A large, formal pact between the major remain forces \u2013 Labour, the Lib Dems, the Greens, Plaid Cymru and the SNP \u2013 is off the table. A month ago, people were talking about 1918, when the Liberals and Conservative coalition won a landslide victory by fielding a single candidate for both parties on a seat-by-seat basis. Never such innocence again.</p> <p>But the jeopardy of a far-right Tory majority has introduced a trace of humility (\u201cWith the real prospect of an election, people begin to understand their real size,\u201d one pollster told me. \u201cSo Anna Soubry acts like she\u2019s Germany, but realises she\u2019s actually Luxembourg\u201d). According to Best for Britain data, around 457 seats are immune to alliances, leaving around <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/best-for-britain-general-election-hit-list-1-6220810\" title=\"\">150 marginals</a>. In 111 of these, the numbers strongly implore Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid to swing behind Labour (in 30 seats, even a 5% shift from Labour to the Lib Dems would deliver the seat to the Conservatives).</p> <p>This is well understood by parliamentary candidates, who are in constant talks about non-aggression pacts. Seats such as Portsmouth South, Battersea, Bermondsey and Old Southwark, and Kensington and Chelsea are tantalising for the Lib Dems \u2013 either because they\u2019re the strongest second party and could leverage their bolder Brexit position, or because they\u2019ve had a recent surge \u2013 but the best bet for a progressive MP in those seats is for everyone to campaign for Labour. There are other seats where the Liberals have to run strong campaigns and be seen to do so. <a href=\"http://www.putneysw15.com/default.asp?section=info&amp;page=conpoll001.htm\" title=\"\">Hope Not Hate has data</a> on Justine Greening\u2019s seat, Putney. The Labour candidate, Fleur Anderson, is strong and well liked, but the numbers \u2013 Tories 34%, Lab 22%, Lib Dems 30%, with a 7% Green showing \u2013 mean that anyone putting together tactical voting cribsheets would go Lib Dem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/13/brexit-new-political-alliance-remainers-boris-johnson\">After the Brexit storm, a new political alliance could emerge | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Straight tactical voting could work beautifully, or it could go very badly: if lots of different campaigns with different organisational interests make different recommendations, that will be wasted energy and, ultimately, wasted votes. </p> <p>Non-aggression pacts across clusters of seats are always under-reported, since they happen at grassroots level.

      "bodyText": "A general election is now more or less certain, the only remaining question is, \u201cHow soon?\u201d We know where we want to go but we\u2019d rather not be starting from here. If the aim is not just to deny Boris Johnson a majority, but to get rid of the Conservatives as the party of government altogether, the best scenario would be Labour polling high, having created a solid anti-Brexit, anti-hard right, anti-austerity tripod. That hasn\u2019t happened, but a progressive alliance is still more than capable of having a decisive impact. Nigel Farage says a pact between his Brexit party and the Tories would make them \u201cunstoppable\u201d. Yet the focus on Johnson\u2019s ability to ally with Farage is misplaced. The Conservatives and the Brexit party will certainly pull together; the only unknown is how many core Tory values the prime minister is prepared to traduce to get there, which is hardly unknown at all. A progressive alliance, on the other hand, would be much more fragile and its conclusions less foregone. The fundamental block is the Labour party \u2013 obsessed with vote share, it has always opposed alliances of any kind. In 2017, if it had stood aside in the Isle of Wight \u2013 bear in mind that this seat has never returned a Labour MP \u2013 the Greens would have repaid them in 12 other constituencies. But no dice, then, and advisers around Jeremy Corbyn were scornful about the successful alliances made between the Greens and the Liberal Democrats, on the basis that their main impact had been to reduce the Green vote share (cut by half on the 2015 election). While Labour frontbenchers talk constantly to Liberal Democrats \u2013 indeed, last week\u2019s parliamentary victories couldn\u2019t have been won without a fair amount of talking to Tories \u2013 nobody at shadow cabinet level is talking about pacts. Emily Thornberry can just about hear the word \u201calliance\u201d without recoiling, but even she \u2013 pragmatic, in a 70% remain constituency \u2013 is not practically seeking one. The Lib Dems have erected their own barriers, mainly in the form of their performative hostility towards Labour. Their full revoke stance, adopted this week, is not a meaningful contribution to the Brexit process, unless they believe they\u2019ll win an election outright \u2013 in which case they have taken leave of their senses. Rather, it\u2019s designed to underscore their superiority over the Labour party, in the eyes of hard remainers; entirely speciously, since they know they\u2019ll never be called out on it. Taken together with the much friendlier noises they make to Tory defectors than to anyone in the Labour hierarchy, it is hard to perceive much warmth between the two blocs. However, this is mostly strategic; it will help both the Lib Dems and Labour if remainer Tories \u2013 has any group ever been so politically homeless? \u2013 find somewhere to cast their votes, otherwise that\u2019s a 4 million-strong army of silence. It would be much harder for them to vote for Jo Swinson\u2019s party were it seen to be chummy with Corbyn\u2019s, and the smarter elements of Labour take their catcalls with a pinch of salt. A large, formal pact between the major remain forces \u2013 Labour, the Lib Dems, the Greens, Plaid Cymru and the SNP \u2013 is off the table. A month ago, people were talking about 1918, when the Liberals and Conservative coalition won a landslide victory by fielding a single candidate for both parties on a seat-by-seat basis. Never such innocence again. But the jeopardy of a far-right Tory majority has introduced a trace of humility (\u201cWith the real prospect of an election, people begin to understand their real size,\u201d one pollster told me. \u201cSo Anna Soubry acts like she\u2019s Germany, but realises she\u2019s actually Luxembourg\u201d). According to Best for Britain data, around 457 seats are immune to alliances, leaving around 150 marginals. In 111 of these, the numbers strongly implore Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid to swing behind Labour (in 30 seats, even a 5% shift from Labour to the Lib Dems would deliver the seat to the Conservatives). This is well understood by parliamentary candidates, who are in constant talks about non-aggression pacts. Seats such as Portsmouth South, Battersea, Bermondsey and Old Southwark, and Kensington and Chelsea are tantalising for the Lib Dems \u2013 either because they\u2019re the strongest second party and could leverage their bolder Brexit position, or because they\u2019ve had a recent surge \u2013 but the best bet for a progressive MP in those seats is for everyone to campaign for Labour. There are other seats where the Liberals have to run strong campaigns and be seen to do so. Hope Not Hate has data on Justine Greening\u2019s seat, Putney. The Labour candidate, Fleur Anderson, is strong and well liked, but the numbers \u2013 Tories 34%, Lab 22%, Lib Dems 30%, with a 7% Green showing \u2013 mean that anyone putting together tactical voting cribsheets would go Lib Dem. Straight tactical voting could work beautifully, or it could go very badly: if lots of different campaigns with different organisational interests make different recommendations, that will be wasted energy and, ultimately, wasted votes. Non-aggression pacts across clusters of seats are always under-reported, since they happen at grassroots level. But they\u2019re vital \u2013 the Greens in Norwich South would not have swung behind Labour\u2019s Clive Lewis in 2017 if the red-green candidates in neighbouring constituencies had been savaging each other. In the same year in East Sussex, there was an explicit trade in seats between the Lib Dems and the Greens, which nearly pulled off a progressive republic in a sea of blue. In Cumbria, too, activists negotiated under the radar across five seats; and there was \u201cquite a lot of speed dating going on between the parties\u201d, as one Lib Dem activist put it, in Frome, Bristol West, Gloucester and Stroud. This is very similar to the informal alliances of 1997, which is the interesting bit; you expect a progressive alliance to look scrappy, patchworked, cobbled-together.

His wife is having an affair \u2013 with her husband. The cheated-on pair become friends, but vow not to behave badly. Like Brief Encounter, the film aches with the understanding that impossible love makes for a more romantic movie. It\u2019s gorgeously detailed, drenched in sensuality \u2013 a scene in which the two squeeze past each other in a narrow alleyway by night has a humid sexiness. <strong>CC</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/oct/27/1\">Read the review</a></em></p> <h2>4</h2> <h2><strong>Under the Skin</strong> (2013)</h2> <p>Jonathan Glazer\u2019s first film in nearly a decade (and still his most recent) turned out to be an uncategorisable masterwork.

And it is all inscribed in the story of the movie\u2019s leading character, a man with the Bunyanesque name of Daniel Plainview. Daniel Day-Lewis gives perhaps the greatest, certainly the most exotic performance of his career as an oil prospector in the early 20th century, rewarded with colossal wealth that never gives him the smallest pleasure.</p> <p>The movie perhaps looks even stranger, starker and more unforgiving now than it did in 2007 when it first came out.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt star as a fading western star and his mutt-loving stunt double in this relaxed and loving roast of bygone Tinseltown. CS Read the review 99 Bright Star (2009) An early lead for Ben Whishaw as the ailing John Keats romancing Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) is the tremulous soul of this underappreciated Jane Campion drama. The butterflies are too tropical for Hampstead, but the rest is spot-on. CS Read the review 98 The Dark Knight (2008) The only comic book movie to make the cut is Christopher Nolan\u2019s genre masterpiece: fatalist, bracing and forever the legacy of Heath Ledger, posthumously awarded an Oscar for his terrifying performance. CS Read the review 97 Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) Michael Moore\u2019s finest hour: a blazing juggernaut with George W Bush, the Iraq war, the media, democracy and us, the gullible masses, in its crosshairs. Agitprop, and essential. CS Read the review 96 Private Life (2018) Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti struggle to start a family, and to keep their marriage together, in this subtle, funny and often wondrously uncomfortable Netflix comedy written and directed by Tamara Jenkins. CS Read the review 95 Call Me By Your Name (2017) Rarely has summer lust been so headily captured as in Luca Guadagnino\u2019s breakout Italian romance. Transformative leads from Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Armie Hammer captured the collective imagination; Michael Stuhlbarg gently grounded realities. CS Read the review 94 Gladiator (2000) Ridley Scott\u2019s deluxe Roman blockbuster is toga soap turned up to the absolute maximus. Russell Crowe bellows and glowers opposite hyper-evil Joaquin Phoenix and lugubrious Oliver Reed (who died during production). Yet there are many grace notes under the fire and fury. CS Read the review 93 You, the Living (2007) The second in Roy Andersson\u2019s trilogy of wackily incisive Swedish vignettes comes at you thick and fast \u2013 about 50 micro-sketches, sometimes loosely linked \u2013 yet sticks like plasticine beneath your fingernails. CS Read the review 92 The Hurt Locker (2008) Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s extraordinary story of a controlled explosions team \u2013 headed by a never-better Jeremy Renner \u2013 is intense, immersive and impossible to shake. CS Read the review 91 Etre et Avoir (2002) Events soured after the shoot but Nicolas Philibert\u2019s sole big hit remains a disarmingly funny study of a graceful and kind schoolteacher caring for a motley crew of under-11s in rural France. CS Read the review 90 Eden (2014) Even non-ravers can\u2019t fail to be shaken by Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve\u2019s vital tale of love and clubbing, vaguely based on the rise of Daft Punk. Giddy yet gripping. CS Read the review 89 The Selfish Giant (2013) Clio Barnard\u2019s second feature doesn\u2019t have the shock of innovation of her verbatim cinema debut, The Arbor, but the story of two lads scrapping around junkyards to escape their homes is a masterpiece of lyrical social realism. CS Read the review 88 Gomorrah (2008) Director Matteo Garrone announced himself big-time with this blazing screen treatment of Roberto Saviano\u2019s fearless account of the contemporary activities of Neapolitan mobsters: a thoroughly chilling chronicle of corruption and savagery rendered in tremendous style. AP Read the review 87 The Wind that Shakes the Barley (2006) When Ken Loach won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes for his film about the Irish rebellion against British rule, the tabloids went on the attack (Daily Mail: \u201cWhy Does Ken Loach hate his country so much?\u201d). None of them had actually seen the film, a powerful, compassionate drama starring Cillian Murphy and Padraic Delaney as Republican brothers split by the civil war that followed independence in 1922. CC Read the review 86 No Country for Old Men (2007) The Coens\u2019 Cormac McCarthy adaptation is a scorching study of benevolence and evil with rich and weathered turns from Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and a glossily horrible one from Javier Bardem. CS Read the review 85 Burning (2018) One of the recent stream of fine dramas issuing from South Korea, Lee Chang-dong\u2019s adaptation of a Haruki Murakami story is an elusive, unsettling thriller, in which a young writer reconnects with a former schoolfriend, only to find she mysteriously disappears after a trip away. AP Read the review 84 Tropical Malady (2005) A young solider and a feral boy fall in love, dance to the Clash then trek to the jungle searching for a shaman dressed up as a tiger. Thai master Apichatpong Weerasethakul\u2019s hypnotic experimentalism has never been bettered; sorry, Uncle Boonmee. CS Read the review 83 The Son\u2019s Room (2001) Nanni Moretti\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or-winning drama about a father crippled by grief after the accidental death of his child is not for the faint-hearted. Yet the Italian writer/director/star performs miracles making a movie so wrenching also so hopeful. CS Read the review 82 Stories We Tell (2012) Sarah Polley followed Away From Her and Take This Waltz by turning the camera on her own family secrets in this tricksy and compassionate documentary uncovering the true identity of her father. CS Read the review 81 Fish Tank (2009) Andrea Arnold\u2019s bad mum high-rise dance tragedy is singular, sensuous and alive with everyday upset. Actor Katie Jarvis took six years off after shooting; roughly the same as audiences needed to recover from the shake it gave, and the sight of Michael Fassbender. CS Read the review 80 Requiem for a Dream (2000) Hubert Selby Jr\u2019s lacerating novel that lasers in on the exhilaration and tragedy of addiction is given expansive, stylish treatment by the then-emerging director Darren Aronofsky. Incredibly glamorous and miserably heartbreaking, this film gave notice of Aronofsky\u2019s brilliance. AP Read the review 79 Persepolis (2007) Iranian-French director Marjane Satrapi adapted her own graphic novel in this animated fantasy-memoir about a 10-year-old girl growing up in Tehran after the 1979 revolution. A real original, and it still looks unique. AP Read the review 78 Ocean\u2019s Eleven (2001) Steven Soderbergh is the Renaissance man of American cinema, and this intricately crafted heist movie \u2013 remade from the old Frank Sinatra chestnut \u2013 shows him on never-bettered, commercially minded form. George Clooney is at his most Cary Grant-ish as the leader of the crack team of robbers. AP Read the review 77 Lost in Translation (2003) Sofia Coppola\u2019s second feature stands up: utterly distinctive, wildly romantic and fleetingly queasy. Scarlett Johannson and Bill Murray are impeccable casting as the unlikely soulmates thrown together in high-rise Tokyo. CS Read the review 76 Ten (2002) Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami had already proved himself a master in the late 20th century; this simple but effective piece \u2013 featuring a woman driving different people around Tehran \u2013 proved he could do it in the 21st. Kiarostami and his star Mania Akbari conjure knotty drama out of a series of conversations about marriage, family, religion and sex. AP Read the review 75 Philomena (2013) Stephen Frears brings tonal tact and unobtrusive genius to this wonderfully funny and touching real-life tale of an Irish natterer (Judi Dench) and cynical reporter (Steve Coogan) who demolish red tape and challenge evil nuns to try to find her long-lost son. CS Read the review 74 A Prophet (2009) French film-maker Jacques Audiard\u2019s blistering arthouse prison thriller begins with a 19-year-old rookie prisoner (Tahar Rahim) being made an offer he can\u2019t refuse by the mob: execute a police informant or be killed. The murder, a brutal struggle with a razor blade in a six by eight cell, is unforgettable. It\u2019s the start of the kid\u2019s prison education. A film supercharged with edginess. CC Read the review 73 Love &amp; Friendship (2016) Whit Stillman, Kate Beckinsale and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny reunite 20 years after The Last Days of Disco for the most blindingly funny \u2013 and faithful - Jane Austen adaptation yet. Spun from her first novel, Lady Susan, this is the tale of an epically bitchy and ambitious widow upending her nearest and dearest. Beckinsale has never been better; Tom Bennett steals the show as the fantastically dim lord lined up for her daughter. CS Read the review 72 Waltz With Bashir (2008) Israeli soldier-turned-film-maker Ari Folman\u2019s film is a kind of animated companion to Apocalypse Now, a hallucinatory statement about the trauma of conflict and the madness of war. It\u2019s an autobiographical documentary, Folman interviewing the men he fought alongside, aged 19, in the first Lebanon war of 1982. He has repressed his memories of the time. The film\u2019s climax is the massacre of Palestinian refugees by Christian Phalangists at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. CC Read the review 71 Capernaum (2018) A sprawling drama that functions both as an excoriating treatise on the nature of poverty in Lebanon, and an idiosyncratic drama in which a child takes his parents to court for their ill-treatment of him. We tend to think of the latter type of juvenile emancipation as the province of overprivileged westerners, but director Nadine Labaki makes it work in the toughest of social circumstances: a 12-year-old, living in the Beirut slums, takes steps to deal with his parents\u2019 neglect. A highly original and affecting film. AP Read the review 70 Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) Such was the glut of Judd Apatow-ish comedies to come our way about 10 years ago that it\u2019s easy to forget what a gem this is; how deep and weird the performances (stand up, Steve Carell), how fast the laughs and rich the detail. CS Read the review 69 Paddington 2 (2017) Hugh Grant recently called this the best film in which he\u2019s ever been involved \u2013 and he might well be right. Paul King did the unthinkable and made a sequel to his insta-classic yet more charming, inventive and across-the-generations entertaining. CS Read the review 68 Mr Turner (2014) Passed over by the British and American film academies \u2013 though Timothy Spall\u2019s glorious grunting lead was rightly recognised by Cannes \u2013 Mike Leigh\u2019s painter biopic is meticulous, moving and still underappreciated. CS Read the review 67 Dogtooth (2009) Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s debut film was the only one, in the end, to make our list; its tonal idiosyncrasy and battily unsettling story and performances just edging out Alps, The Lobster and The Favourite. CS Read the review 66 Brokeback Mountain (2005) Ang Lee\u2019s romance missed out to Crash for the best picture Oscar, but its legacy as a five-hankie ode to doomed romance lives on. Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger star as the farmhands whose love survives marriages, years of separation \u2013 and even death. CS Read the review 65 Happy as Lazzaro (2018) A beautiful, strange dream of a film, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher\u2019s drama looks at first as if it\u2019s set sometime in the dim and distant, a portrait of villagers exploited by feudal oppression. But no, there\u2019s a mobile phone. OK, a flip-phone, but this is modern rural Italy. Well, the first half, anyway. After that, it\u2019s complicated, with a flight into magic realism or perhaps even reincarnation. CC Read the review 64 The Incredibles (2004) The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw ranked The Incredibles as Pixar\u2019s best ever film, the jewel in the crown. And only Pixar could make a superhero movie for kids about a midlife crisis. Mr Incredible is living in suburbia with his family after one lawsuit too many. Edna Mode, fashion designer to the supers, is an utter delight: \u201cThis is a hobo suit, dahlin, you can\u2019t be seen in it!\u201d CC Read the review 63 We Need to Talk about Kevin (2011) Lynne Ramsay didn\u2019t soften the blows adapting Lionel Shriver\u2019s bestselling novel about a Columbine-style high-school massacre. A what-if feminist parable, this is a movie that thinks the unthinkable: what if a mother doesn\u2019t like her child, or even love him? And the casting is killer, with Ezra Miller as Kevin and Tilda Swinton playing the mother. It\u2019s a bruising watch, but Ramsay makes it\u2019s impossible to turn away. CC Read the review 62 Waiting for Happiness (2002) Malian director Abderrahmane Sissako won a lot of admirers for this slow-burn study of life in a west African town. Returning to Mauritania, his country of birth, Sissako puts together a string of vignettes and encounters, linked together by a returning, westernised student who can barely remember the local language. AP Read the review 61 The Souvenir (2019) Joanna Hogg\u2019s belated international breakthrough is a story of extraordinary specificity \u2013 young Hogg has disastrous affair while living in Knightsbridge and studying as a film student in the early 1980s \u2013 with rare cut-through and relatability. Honor Swinton Byrne is astonishing in her first film; Tom Burke inch-perfect as the charming but parasitic older man. CS Read the review 60 Ted (2012) Seth MacFarlane\u2019s brief ascent to the Hollywood firmament was down to this scabrously funny talking-bear farce, which helped reinvent the grossout comedy. Mark Wahlberg is great as the straight man to the foul-mouthed toy of the title, with Mila Kunis as his censorious fiancee. MacFarlane\u2019s creation was simultaneously endearing and outrageous. AP Read the review 59 Gangs of Wasseypur (2012) Mammoth two-part Indian crime film that\u2019s a long, long way from Bollywood. Directed by Anurag Kashyap, this is conceived on a giant scale, as generations of three gangster families fight for supremacy over the course of half a century. Stylish, visceral film-making, violent and hard-hitting, it\u2019s got a valid claim to be India\u2019s answer to The Godfather. AP Read the review 58 Wuthering Heights (2011) Andrea Arnold tossed out the costume drama rulebook with her raw, passionate retelling of Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s novel. I\u2019d argue the case for Wuthering Heights as one of the most criminally underrated movies of recent years \u2013 though it\u2019s been influential, blazing a trail for stripped-back period movies such as Lady Macbeth. Arnold was an early adopter of inclusive casting, too, giving the role of Heathcliff to black actor James Howson. CC Read the review 57 Leave No Trace (2018) It took Winter\u2019s Bone\u2019s Debra Granik eight years to get this off the ground, but was worth the wait: a brilliantly moving eco drama with Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie as a father and daughter living off grid in an Oregon forest, but whose relationship and priorities are changed as the child begins the transition to adulthood. AP Read the review 56 Behind the Candelabra (2013) Relegated to telly in the US, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s wondrously funny and lavish Liberace biopic had a cinema release in the UK. Michael Douglas cast vanity aside and caution to the wind with virtuosic results as the promiscuous ivories-tickler; Matt Damon was terrific against type as his lover, Rob Lowe pinched and uproarious as their much-employed cosmetic surgeon. CS Read the review 55 Russian Ark (2002) Groundbreaking single-shot paean to the Winter Palace in St Petersburg from Russian director Alexander Sokurov. Exploiting then newly developed video technology, Sokurov crafted an elaborately choreographed procession of tableaux and set pieces that explored three centuries of Russian history and culture, from the imperial era to the wartime siege of Leningrad. AP Read the review 54 The Social Network (2010) After the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the treachery and backstabbery in Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher\u2019s Facebook origin tale looks positively quaint \u2013 the geeks and nerds fighting over who had the idea for Facebook first. Nevertheless, this is still an outrageously watchable hatchet job. Jesse Eisenberg is a knockout Mark Zuckerberg, the smartest guy in the room (though not sartorially, in flip-flops and a hoodie). CC Read the review 53 Fire at Sea (2016) A beautifully shot observational documentary about the continuing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean: the lethally dangerous boats that carry refugees from Africa and end up on the Italian island of Lampedusa. Shot by director Gianfranco Rosi with an evocative lyricism that sits in counterpoint to the blazing anger at the film\u2019s heart. AP Read the review 52 Amores Perros (2000) A film that grabs you by the neck and shakes hard, this brutal crime drama announced the Mexican director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu as a major new talent in 2000. (And lumbered him for the while with the label \u201cMexico\u2019s Tarantino\u201d.) A film of mayhem and fury, three stories intersect around a car crash in which one of the passengers is a champion fighting dog. CC Read the review 51 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) Western audiences unfamiliar with the wuxia martial arts genre had never seen anything like Ang Lee\u2019s dazzling 18th-century-set epic in 2000 \u2013 fighters flying through the air with balletic grace. In the most exhilarating scene, the daughter of a regional governor (Ziyi Zhang) goes sword-to-sword with a famous warrior (Chow Yun-fat) in the branches of bamboo trees swaying high above the ground. CC Read the review 50 Before Sunset (2004) In Richard Linklater\u2019s gorgeous, romantic Before Sunrise, a pair of twentysomethings (Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke) spent the day together in Vienna. Here in the second movie when they meet again in Paris for another brief encounter, they are in their 30s. So the questions are for grownups. Am I with the right person? Where did my life go? It also has the best line ever about being in a couple with small children: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m running a small nursery with someone I used to date.\u201d CC Read the review 49 24 Hour Party People (2002) Michael Winterbottom and Steve Coogan\u2019s truth-tickling hit a high note with this joyful sorta-biopic of the record label boss and broadcaster Tony Wilson. Playful, ingenious and prodigiously informative, it\u2019s a triumph of vision over verite. It\u2019s also a total blast. CS Read the review 48 The House of Mirth (2000) Terence Davies utilised Gillian Anderson\u2019s poised elegance to good advantage in this brilliantly controlled adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel. Anderson plays Lily Bart, the woman whose reputation and standing are gradually sullied until she becomes an unmarriageable outcast in end of 19th-century America. AP Read the review 47 Margaret (2011) Here\u2019s another dark American tale from Manchester by the Sea writer-director Kenneth Lonergan (Margaret was completed in 2007 but only released in 2011 after a wrangle with the studio). Set in post 9/11 New York, Anna Paquin is an overentitled teenager partly responsible for a tragic accident. As in Manchester by the Sea, the effect is shattering; it is like watching actual lives fall apart. CC Read the review 46 Volver (2006) Arguably Pen\u00e9lope Cruz\u2019s finest performance, in one of Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s key films: a heady stew of murder, family strife and supernatural shenanigans. Cruz plays a woman forced to kill and bury her ex-husband, while her dead mother appears to be haunting her hairdresser sister. All is resolved after various traumas are lanced. AP Read the review 45 13th (2016) Intense, anger-driven documentary from Ava DuVernay on the racialisation of the US\u2019s justice system, positing the idea that the massively disproportionate incarceration of African-American men is simply slavery by another name. With a title referring to the constitutional amendment that abolished slavery, DuVernay suggests that privatised prisons, cheap labour and light-touch capitalism are all in it together. Tough stuff. AP Read the review 44 Toni Erdmann (2016) A knockout blow for the lazy, patronising stereotype that Germans don\u2019t have a sense of humour, Maren Ade\u2019s Toni Erdmann is one of the funniest films to hit (arthouse) cinemas in years. It\u2019s the story of a workaholic management consultant (Sandra H\u00fcller) whose embarrassing dad turns up unannounced for the weekend wearing joke-shop false teeth. A genuine one-off, the film is partly a satire on Europe, globalisation and workplace misogyny, as well as being a prickly sweet father-daughter movie. CC Read the review 43 The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) Possibly the most fun anyone\u2019s had at the cinema so far this century, Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Wolf of Wall Street ought to be a cautionary tale. It\u2019s based on the autobiography of crooked stockbroker Jordan Belfort, convicted in 1999 for fraud and money-laundering. But why focus on regret, when there are hookers, drugs and fast cars? Leonardo DiCaprio is outrageously entertaining as Belfort. CC Read the review 42 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days (2007) The film whose Palme d\u2019Or win heralded the arrival of a new wave of Romanian cinema. A young woman, helped by her friend, arranges an illegal abortion in the late 80s; the squalid events that follow parallel the decay and chaos of the country as the communist dictatorship began to collapse. Harrowing but clear-sighted. AP Read the review 41 The Handmaiden (2016) The Handmaiden is one of cinema\u2019s great literary adaptations: Park Chan-wook transposes Sarah Waters\u2019s crime novel Fingersmith from Victorian London to Korea in the 1930s. In this most twisted of love stories, a pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) poses as maid to a wealthy heiress (Kim Min-hee). But who is the double-crosser? Depending on your tastes, a candidate for sexiest film of the century. CC Read the review 40 Unrelated (2007) At the age of 47, after a career directing TV soaps such as Casualty and EastEnders, Joanna Hogg reinvented herself as auteur of a new breed of cinema. In her feature debut, Unrelated, Kathryn Worth played a fortyish woman holidaying in Tuscany with two dysfunctional families and flirting outrageously with one of the lads (Tom Hiddleston in his first movie). A cinema of awkwardness, wielding a scalpel on the well-to-do middle classes, was born. CC Read the review 39 Meek\u2019s Cutoff (2010) Kelly Reichardt is a master of slow cinema, the maker of films about American outsiders, living without a safety net. Meek\u2019s Cutoff is a western set in 1840s Oregon, following three families on the wagon train west. Their leader is show-offy Stephen Meek (Bruce Greenwood), but Reichardt\u2019s focus, as is customary for her, is on the women \u2013 a trio played by Michelle Williams, Zoe Kazan and Shirley Henderson. CC Read the review 38 Once Upon a Time in Anatolia (2011) Here\u2019s a police procedural with a difference by the Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan \u2013 the whodunnit and why playing second fiddle to long stretches of silence. It\u2019s set in rural Turkey where officials are spending the night driving a murder suspect around looking for a body. What they find, however, is mostly existential despair. Not exactly easy viewing, but it\u2019s a masterpiece of slow cinema. CC Read the review 37 Dogville (2003) Lars von Trier\u2019s Brechtian parable about coercive capitalism remains arguably the Danish provocateur\u2019s masterpiece. Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany both excel in this study of a woman on the run from gangsters who is offered shelter in a small town in return for undertaking chores. Von Trier\u2019s use of stylised, floor-painted sets is the inspired final touch. AP Read the review 36 A Separation (2011) The film begins with a couple in front of a judge asking for a divorce. She wants to leave Iran and take their daughter. He cannot go; his elderly father is sick. Everyone behaves badly in Asghar Farhadi\u2019s desperately painful family drama. Farhadi\u2019s superpower is empathy, making the audience see all points of view. He lays depth charges in seemingly inconsequential moments with emotionally thrilling consequences. CC Read the review 35 45 Years (2015) British director Andrew Haigh\u2019s quietly devastating drama is a deeply moving portrait of marriage with the shiver of a ghost story. Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay play a Norfolk couple planning their 45th wedding anniversary. A week before the party, a letter lands on their doormat like a hand grenade with news of his early lost love. Rampling is sensational. CC Read the review 34 The Child (L\u2019Enfant, 2002) The Dardenne brothers\u2019 second Palme d\u2019Or was bestowed on this stark portrait of underclass desperation, filmed in their characteristic hyper-naturalist manner. J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier plays a petty criminal who sells his newborn baby in the adoption black market, but his devastated girlfriend\u2019s response forces a kind of redemption. AP Read the review 33 The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) Probably most Wes Anderson-y of Wes Anderson\u2019s films and certainly his finest, with a to-die-for cast and the best fur coat in the history of cinema. Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller are the Tenenbaum siblings, all former child prodigies. The brilliance has faded. Who\u2019s to blame? Enter paterfamilias Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), a man who consoles his grieving grandsons with: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss. Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.\u201d CC Read the review 32 Gravity (2013) If we are living through a golden age of space movies, here\u2019s where it started, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s spectacular thriller, shot with unbearable tension and Discovery Channel realism. Sandra Bullock is the rookie astronaut with George Clooney by her side, a living, breathing Buzz Lightyear. When a storm of debris hits the pair, a terrifying fight for survival ensues. Astoundingly good. CC Read the review 31 Anomalisa (2015) Charlie Kaufman\u2019s existential breakdown with stop-motion puppets is a miniature masterpiece of concept and execution. David Thewlis voices the depressed motivational speaker to whom everyone sounds the same \u2013 except for Jennifer Jason Leigh\u2019s scarred sales agent. \u201cWhat is it to be human?\u201d asks Michael Stone (Thewlis). \u201cTo ache?\u201d Few films try to answer: this Faberg\u00e9 egg of a film does. CS Read the review 30 Leviathan (2014) The hardest-drinking movie on our list - with some stiff competition - Andrey Zvyagintsev\u2019s anti-Putin polemic is brilliant, ballsy and completely sozzled. Our hero fisherman is forced from his home so that the corrupt local mayor can build his own palace on the site. A priest speaks of \u201creawakening the soul of the Russian people\u201d as their spirits lie crushed at his feet. Corruption is so endemic, these people have even lost God. This is the most almighty achievement. CS Read the review 29 Nebraska (2013) Bruce Dern discards his marbles on a windmill-tilting road trip with loving but frustrated son Will Forte. Alexander Payne\u2019s black-and-white ode to small-town America is his best this century (Sideways has not aged like a fine wine). It also features June Squibb being completely filthy. CS Read the review 28 The Tree of Life (2011) Terrence Malick\u2019s return to cinema six years after The New World has been vaguely tainted by the slew of woozy filmic xeroxes that have followed, but his first comeback \u2013 in which Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain stand in for his parents in 1950s Texas \u2013 is a choking knockout. CS Read the review 27 The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) Just nudging Gene Hackman\u2019s Tenenbaum clan down the list, Wes Anderson\u2019s glorious 1930s confection is a delight with a hard nugget of politics at its core. Ralph Fiennes\u2019s central turn as charming concierge M Gustave, all beneficent sex and abashed camp, remains the man\u2019s finest hour. CS Read the review 26 A One and a Two (Yi Yi, 2000) Edward Yang\u2019s final film is a delicate domestic miracle: the story of one family seen through the perspectives of the father, the son and the daughter. A wedding begins proceedings, a funeral ends them. The stuff in the middle is the everyday, dissected with rare beauty and gravity. CS Read the review 25 Get Out (2017) Jordan Peele\u2019s debut is a perfect, hard-polished gem of a film. A race satire that skewers beautifully, it\u2019s also a chilling comedy, a proper horror and 104 minutes of complete entertainment. CS Read the review 24 Ida (2013) Brief as a dream and just as devastating, Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s black and white story of a novice nun on a road trip with her aunt in 1962 Poland to discover the fate of her Jewish parents is spare, shocking and utterly unforgettable. CS Read the review 23 Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006) Still Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s finest moment, a feature-length upscaling of his ludicrously hilarious TV character, whose purpose is to sucker the unsuspecting into condemning themselves out of their own mouths. Borat is on a trip in the US to try to marry Pamela Anderson; not everything works, but when it does it\u2019s astounding: cruelly revelatory and hysterically funny at the same time. AP Read the review 22 Spirited Away (2001) Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s wondrous animation, the greatest success of a spectacular run from Japan\u2019s Studio Ghibli. A gentle, mysterious fable about a 10-year-old girl whose family stumble upon a haunted bathhouse. After her parents are turned into pigs, she works to lift the curse, encountering a variety of spirit-world beings along the way. AP Read the review 21 The White Ribbon (2009) Michael Haneke won his first Palme d\u2019Or with this chilling, steel-hard parable set in Germany just before the first world war. The inhabitants of a small village are dogged by mysterious, violent incidents that serve mostly to exacerbate the dysfunctional social codes they all live by \u2013 and elliptically suggests the moral climate that evolved into Nazism. AP Read the review 20 Roma (2018) Despite lingering controversy over its adoption by Netflix in its war with the film industry, Roma still stands as an absolutely major work. Mexican auteur Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n returned to the Mexico City of his childhood, telling the story of a middle-class family and their nanny-cum-maid in swooning, lyrical black and white. Part memoir, part elegaic fiction, Cuaron hit the heights with this. AP Read the review 19 Lincoln (2012) Steven Spielberg\u2019s portrait of the great US president looked at the time like a history lesson come to life: graced by a monumental, Oscar-winning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, it detailed the arm-twisting and chicanery behind the passing of his slave-freeing constitutional amendment. These days, it looks like a fantasy: a president with principles: who\u2019d have thought? AP Read the review 18 A Serious Man (2009) The Coen brothers don\u2019t really do personal, but this is as close as they\u2019ve got (so far). Set in their home town of Minneapolis in the late 60s, A Serious Man stars Michael Stuhlbarg as an academic whose life is roiled by continuing uncertainty and self-doubt \u2013 triggering repeat visits to his rabbis, a marriage breakdown and extended interactions with his oddball brother. AP Read the review 17 The Great Beauty (2013) The Young Pope director Paolo Sorrentino crafted this swooningly beautiful love letter to Rome \u2013 \u201cla grande bellezza\u201d \u2013 in its decadent, jaded glory. Toni Servillo, Sorrentino\u2019s regular onscreen foil, plays journalist Jep Gambardella, a bon viveur beginning to sense the dying of his personal light, and hunting out meaning and substance in the world around him. AP Read the review 16 The Act of Killing (2012) An extraordinary documentary about the wave of barbaric killings that swept Indonesia in the mid-60s. Orchestrated by director Joshua Oppenheimer, this film revisits the perpetrators of some horrific events and asks them \u2013 with little need for encouragement \u2013 to re-enact them. The result is almost unwatchable: the murderers\u2019 glee at performing, and the remorse they may or may not experience as a result. AP Read the review 15 Shoplifters (2018) Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda won the Palme d\u2019Or for this exquisitely turned drama that \u2013 like much of Kore-eda\u2019s previous output \u2013 explores what it is to be a family in entirely non-conventional circumstances. A shoplifting gang take in a young girl who seems abandoned; how they hang together \u2013 or not \u2013 is the film\u2019s key theme. AP Read the review 14 White Material (2009) One of Isabelle Huppert\u2019s finest performances, and that\u2019s saying something. Director Claire Denis drew on her own upbringing in colonial west Africa to give this study of a hard-as-nails plantation owner a pungent whiff of authenticity. Huppert is Maria, obsessed with getting in the coffee harvest as a violent civil conflict moves ever closer. Saddled with an untrustworthy husband and an erratic son, it\u2019s all she can do to survive. AP Read the review 13 Far From Heaven (2002) From director Todd Haynes, this is pastiche at its most brilliantly acute. Haynes takes the bold, vivid melodrama beloved of Douglas Sirk, and reconfigures it to fully reveal the social faultlines of race, sex and class that were considerably more latent in the original. A beautifully crafted act of ancestor worship. AP Read the review 12 Son of Saul (2015) Brutally visceral fable that plunges the viewer headlong into the all-encompassing horror of a Nazi extermination camp. Shot in remorseless, unforgiving close-up by first time Hungarian director L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes, the story of a Jewish prison-camp worker whose job it is to help clear the gas chamber of corpses is cinema at its absolute rawest. AP Read the review 11 Mulholland Drive (2001) A magisterial achievement from David Lynch, despite the difficulties he had getting it off the ground. Originally conceived as the pilot of a new TV series, this expertly fuses Lynch\u2019s softcore pulp obsessions with his trademark creepy surrealism. Naomi Watts was the big discovery here: she plays a wannabe actor who midway seems to switch personalities with another, more jaded one. AP Read the review 10 Team America: World Police (2004) The most audacious slaughter of sacred cows seen on celluloid, Matt Stone and Trey Parker\u2019s marionette action-musical is a gleeful hail of precision-aimed bullets. It\u2019s totally fearless: pops are taken at Hollywood, Broadway, evil dictators, gung-ho superpowers, the intelligence service, bleeding heart liberals, actors \u2013 especially actors \u2013 before signing off with a devastating, if obscene, defence of US interventionism. Politically, it\u2019s scattergun; satirically, it\u2019s spot-on. Mostly, though, it\u2019s just ferociously funny, even if most of the humour does, finally, come from the sight of the 2ft puppets tottering around, getting drunk, having wild sex, attempting to walk through doorways and wrestling panthers played by kittens. CS Read the review 9 Zama (2017) An official working for the Spanish crown descends into madness while waiting for a transfer out of his backwater post in 18th-century Paraguay in Lucrecia Martel\u2019s fevered historical drama. Like a disorienting dream, it\u2019s a film of fragments, moments that worm their way into your memory \u2013 a slave limping with flayed feet, a llama barging into frame during an uncomfortable meeting. Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho is petty, wretched Zama, clinging to his white man\u2019s sense of importance (and his ill-fitting periwig), a symptom of colonial rot. Martel has been called \u201cthe Malick of Latin American cinema\u201d but this feels closer to Herzog. A strange masterpiece. CC Read the review 8 Moonlight (2016) The triumph of Barry Jenkins\u2019s coming-of-age tale over La La Land for the best picture Oscar was extraordinary in all sorts of ways, of which Faye Dunaway\u2019s envelope mixup was maybe the least remarkable. It was the first film with an all-black cast as well as with an LGBTQ theme to scoop the prize \u2013 and it must also rank as one of the most visually and tonally ambitious: told in three parts, with three different leads, each showing the stages of repression and internalised loathing in the young life of a Miami man. It\u2019s simply revelatory: innovative, wildly affecting, utterly beautiful. CS Read the review 7 Synecdoche, New York (2008) After a string of brilliant, industry-transforming scripts, Charlie Kaufman made his directorial debut with this complex, convoluted drama, starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as theatre director Caden Cotard, who is swamped by personal crises as he works on his dream project: building an ever-expanding replica of the city streets and buildings inside a giant warehouse, and populating it with lookalikes; the blurred boundary between performance and reality is mirrored in Cotard\u2019s own breakdown, with the title giving the big clue \u2013 this is all symbolic. AP Read the review 6 Hidden (2005) Having made his name as one of the pioneers of ordeal arthouse with unflinching chronicles of trauma and cruelty, Austrian auteur Michael Haneke achieved a unlikely popular success with this film that connected with France\u2019s deep well of unease about events of the relatively recent past. Daniel Auteuil plays a successful TV host whose contentment is disturbed by the arrival of mysterious surveillance tapes. This seems to be connected with a young Algerian boy whose parents were apparently killed in the infamous 1961 Paris massacre. Haneke ratchets up the tension with an unerring sense of dread and dismay. AP Read the review 5 In the Mood for Love (2000) Has there ever been a more beautiful couple in the history of cinema than Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung in Wong Kar-Wai\u2019s smouldering love story In the Mood for Love? Not that they\u2019re a couple, technically. It\u2019s 1962. Chow (Tony Leung) and Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in next door to each other in a cramped Hong Kong block of flats. His wife is having an affair \u2013 with her husband. The cheated-on pair become friends, but vow not to behave badly. Like Brief Encounter, the film aches with the understanding that impossible love makes for a more romantic movie. It\u2019s gorgeously detailed, drenched in sensuality \u2013 a scene in which the two squeeze past each other in a narrow alleyway by night has a humid sexiness. CC Read the review 4 Under the Skin (2013) Jonathan Glazer\u2019s first film in nearly a decade (and still his most recent) turned out to be an uncategorisable masterwork. Scarlett Johansson plays an alien in human form, trawling the streets of Glasgow for unsuspecting males to \u201ctake home\u201d \u2013 in fact, using them as a food source. From its unnerving alien-POV sequences, to the empathetic scene with actor Adam Pearson (who has neurofibromatosis), to the sheer coldness of the predatory logic of its central figure, Under the Skin achieves a mood and texture unlike anything else before or since. AP Read the review 3 Boyhood (2014) Twelve years in the shooting, Richard Linklater\u2019s story of a child\u2019s life between six and 18 is a vindication of artistic ambition in an age of cinematic snacking. Its downside is to ruin almost every single other film for you \u2013 at least all those in which the actors are conspicuously aged up or down. In watching the bonafide progress of Ellar Coltrane \u2013 as well as Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as his parents \u2013 Boyhood provides its audience with an intimacy and an investment like no other. This is cinema as gentle revolution. CS Read the review 2 12 Years a Slave (2013) Steve McQueen\u2019s real-life story of Solomon Northup, a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery in 19th-century Louisiana, exudes all of the dignity, impatience and artistic fidelity of its director. It is perfectly cast and paced, endlessly surprising, uncompromising and compassionate: a story purely and powefully told, yet full of the extraordinary visual grace notes. It never descends into cliche or even self-pity; it remains a film for adults, uninterested in anything but the truth. To read Northup\u2019s 1853 memoir is to be astonished by the film\u2019s fidelity. CS Read the review 1 There Will Be Blood (2007) Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s strange masterpiece, freely adapted by him from Upton Sinclair\u2019s 1927 novel Oil!, has a dark title that threatens a calamity now visible on the horizon: destruction of the Earth itself. And it is all inscribed in the story of the movie\u2019s leading character, a man with the Bunyanesque name of Daniel Plainview. Daniel Day-Lewis gives perhaps the greatest, certainly the most exotic performance of his career as an oil prospector in the early 20th century, rewarded with colossal wealth that never gives him the smallest pleasure. The movie perhaps looks even stranger, starker and more unforgiving now than it did in 2007 when it first came out. But from 2016, there has been a raging Plainview in plain sight in the White House: Trump, the eccentric property billionaire and spoilt baby whose cranky tweets are as crazy as Plainview\u2019s deranged \u201cmilkshake\u201d pronouncement. What a spectacle Anderson and Day-Lewis create: a portrait of male belligerence and fear, a Tutankhamun of misery, walled up in his own sarcophagus of wealth and prestige.

Instead, it sends them into a \u201cviable but non-culturable state\u201d, which means they are not picked up in standard tests, which take a sample of the food and try to culture any germs on it.</p> <p>The presence of the pathogens is thus masked by the bleach, but they are still dangerous to human health.</p> <p>Erik Millstone, professor of science policy at Sussex University and co-author of the briefing, told the Guardian lives would be at stake if food based on these lower standards were sold in the UK. \u201cI am satisfied [by the evidence] that US food poisoning cases are significantly higher than in the UK.

      "bodyText": "The government has misunderstood the science on the safety of chlorinated chicken, a group of senior food policy experts has said. It has also failed to give watertight commitments that it would not be sold here after a no-deal Brexit, they warn. The experts have written to all MPs to warn that the British public is being \u201csoftened up\u201d to accept chlorinated chicken and other food produced under US safety standards, despite it posing a danger to health. In a briefing from the Centre for Food Policy, timed to reach MPs before party conferences, they argue that recent assurances by a government chief scientist were misleading, and a no-deal Brexit could open the door to unsafe food. Prof Sir Ian Boyd, the outgoing chief scientist at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said in an interview two weeks ago there were \u201cno health problems\u201d with chlorinated chicken and its consumption should be a matter of \u201cconsumer choice\u201d rather than government policy. But the academics point to research published last year which found washing food in bleach does not kill many of the pathogens that cause food poisoning. Instead, it sends them into a \u201cviable but non-culturable state\u201d, which means they are not picked up in standard tests, which take a sample of the food and try to culture any germs on it. The presence of the pathogens is thus masked by the bleach, but they are still dangerous to human health. Erik Millstone, professor of science policy at Sussex University and co-author of the briefing, told the Guardian lives would be at stake if food based on these lower standards were sold in the UK. \u201cI am satisfied [by the evidence] that US food poisoning cases are significantly higher than in the UK. A minority of people suffer fatal complications,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will certainly be fatalities, and they typically affect vulnerable people, such as infants, small children and the elderly.\u201d He said a no-deal Brexit would increase the pressure for the UK to accept food from abroad produced to US standards, especially if shortages raised prices, and warned that current laws on labelling were inadequate. Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City Universityand also a co-author, said the government was \u201cwriggling\u201d over the definitions of safety. \u201cFor the chief scientist at Defra to say what he did is not accidental,\u201d he said.

I saw Margaret projected in perfect conditions with an open mind and heart one night in 2011 at The Rex Berkhamsted - and was completely carried away by it.

      "bodyText": "Runway construction at one of America\u2019s largest airports led to runaway chaos this week, with travelers stranded and flights around the country going into San Francisco delayed or canceled. Thousands of flights departing or heading toward San Francisco international airport had been delayed or canceled since construction began on Saturday, raising questions about how the airport and the airlines prepared, or failed to prepare, for a possible calamity. Airport officials said they alerted airlines about the construction months ago, but it is up to the individual airlines to decide if they are willing to make reductions to their flight schedules. Some cut flights by just 10%. \u201cThe frustrating part was not being notified of potential delays prior to our trip since this runway closure was scheduled and planned,\u201d said Chi-Lan Tran, whose trip back from Detroit took nine hours on Sunday. \u201cAirlines knew about this.\u201d Numerous other travelers voiced their frustration about lengthy delays and lack of communication from airlines. The runway in question is one of the most heavily-traveled at the airport, with more than 68% of all flights crossing at the runway intersection. All airlines use this runway, said Doug Yakel, an airport spokesman. The airport had warned the airlines of the impending and much-needed construction for months, Yakel said. \u201cThe most fundamental thing here is that flight schedule reductions are voluntary,\u201d Yakel said. \u201cWe presented this closure to the airlines, asked them to look at their schedules and opportunities to reduce, and they came back with what reductions they were willing to make. It all comes down to an airline business decision.\u201d The airport was able to reduce all flight schedules in total by 13%, Yakel said, but that clearly wasn\u2019t enough. Since Saturday, there have been more than 2,000 flight delays and more than 600 flight cancellations out of San Francisco, according to the tracking site FlightAware. United, which has a hub in San Francisco, reduced its flight schedule by 10%, while American Airlines reduced its flight schedule by 15%, according to representatives from both airlines. Delta reduced its flight schedule by 10%. \u201cWe knew there would be delays but that they would be less severe than if airlines had attempted to run a full flight schedule,\u201d Yakel said. \u201cI would also add that airlines could choose to make no reductions and you would see greater delays and more day-of cancelations.\u201d Danny Page, whose American Airlines flight coming out of a layover in Dallas-Fort Worth was delayed on Monday for four hours, said airlines should have alerted travelers when they were booking their tickets that this runway closure was going to happen. \u201cIf I had known in advance, I would have switched my flight to arrive in Oakland or another Bay Area airport,\u201d he said. \u201cI can deal with maintenance delays or weather, but it seems like more should have been done to let travelers know in the run up to this project.\u201d Keith Kurmon spent four hours on Sunday crowded at a gate at Boston\u2019s Logan international airport, waiting to get back to San Francisco along with dozens of others.

He heads to New York later this month, and is nervous about a repeat experience \u2013 construction is slated to continue until 27 September.

      "bodyText": "A worker at a major sportswear maker in Japan is suing his employer, claiming he was unfairly treated after taking paternity leave, in a rare legal challenge to the country\u2019s conservative attitude towards gender roles. The 38-year-old man, who has requested anonymity after suffering a backlash on social media, claimed at the Tokyo district court this week that Asics punished him for taking a year\u2019s leave after the birth of his children, in 2015 and 2018. He had been accused of not being a \u201cteam player\u201d, he told the court. \u201cBut it\u2019s wrong. I believe the company is attempting to squash an individual who tried to correct its injustice. The management in fact seems to value when men work outside and women stay at home.\u201d Parental leave in Japan is among the most generous in the world, entitling men and women to a year off work, or longer if there is no public childcare provision. But very few men use their paternity leave entitlement, fearing their careers will suffer. The alleged mistreatment of men who take leave has given rise to a new phrase, patahara \u2013 short for paternity harassment. The term is modelled on matahara \u2013 or maternity harassment \u2013 used to describe abuse experienced by working women after becoming pregnant or giving birth. The employee in the Asics case was initially criticised on Twitter, being described as \u201cselfish\u201d for taking a year of leave for each of his sons, now aged four and one. The inability of male employees to take paternity leave is among the obstacles facing the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, as he attempts to increase the number of women in the workplace, particularly in senior positions, and raise the country\u2019s low birth rate. A corporate culture that values loyalty to the company and long hours, especially from male employees, means just 6% of eligible fathers take paternity leave, according to government data \u2013 way below the goal of 13% by 2020. More than 70% of men who take paternity leave are away for less than a fortnight. That compares to more than 80% of mothers who use their allowance beyond the mandatory eight weeks after birth. The challenge to social norms received a boost recently when the new environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi \u2013 a rising star of Japanese politics \u2013 said he would consider taking paternity leave when his wife gives birth next year. The court plaintiff said: \u201cThere are plenty of people who want to take childcare leave, as it\u2019s their right, but they cannot because their workplace makes it difficult. Someone had to speak up.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d been thinking, I\u2019m going to be a salaryman for something like 40 years, so what\u2019s a year or two of leave compared to that.\u201d The plaintiff, one of a handful of men who have taken their employers to court, said he was transferred to a warehouse operated by an Asics subsidiary after he returned from his first period of paternity leave. Although he did not receive a pay cut or official demotion, he said the physical nature of the work was in stark contrast to his previous role in the company\u2019s personnel department. Asics allowed him to return to a desk job after he injured his shoulder, but gave him \u201cmeaningless\u201d tasks such as translating company guidelines into English, even though he has minimal language skills. He wants to be reinstated in his original job, along with 4.4m yen ($41,000) in damages. Asics denies the allegations and said it had tried to negotiate with the plaintiff\u2019s union representatives and legal team. \u201cWe put effort into fostering diversity, and we will continue to make greater efforts to ensure our work environment and policies allow people to remain active through pregnancy, birth and childcare,\u201d the firm said in a statement. The father\u2019s lawyer, Naoto Sasayama, said: \u201cThe culture established in a post-war Japan expects men to be the sole breadwinner. Stay-at-home men are considered extremely strange. We want to give hope to all those dads who want to take paternity leave.\u201d Agencies contributed to this report.",

Here are some of the night\u2019s key takeaways:</p> \n  <ol> \n   <li><strong>Joe Biden </strong>turned in an overall solid performance that was a far cry from his disastrous first debate. But the former vice president\u2019s reference to \u201crecord player\u201d prompted, along with many Twitter jokes, yet another moment of, \u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d And the debate\u2019s most divisive moment came when <strong>Juli\u00e1n Castro </strong>accused Biden of flip-flopping on healthcare by repeatedly asking him, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro later denied the remark was an attack on Biden\u2019s age, but the question elicited gasps from the audience and immediately recalled Biden\u2019s repeated gaffes in recent weeks. He has, for example, mixed up the locations of recent mass shootings and misidentified the state he was campaigning in. (But it later appeared Castro had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABCWorldNews/status/1172345537598615552\">mischaracterized</a> Biden\u2019s original comments.)<br></li> \n   <li>The biggest question going into the debate was whether Biden and <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong>, two front-runners who were meeting on a debate stage for the first time, would go after each other. The answer turned out to be: not really. With the exception of Biden\u2019s fumbled reference to \u201cthe senator to my left\u201d at the beginning of the debate, the pair focused on defending their proposals more than anything else. Meanwhile, the other top-polling candidate, <strong>B</strong><strong>ernie Sanders, </strong>successfully inserted himself into many of the night\u2019s most policy-driven discussions on healthcare and foreign policy.</li> \n   <li>The narrowed debate field undeniably changed the dynamics of the event. Without the 10 additional candidates spread across two nights, there appeared to be fewer desperate attempts for attention and more calls to unify as one Democratic field. That suggestion didn\u2019t sit well with Castro, who told <strong>Pete Buttigeg </strong>at one point, \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d </li> \n   <li>Of the lower-polling candidates, <strong>Beto O\u2019Rourke </strong>appeared to have the most standout moments. His answers about gun control, coming just a month after the mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, attracted enthusiastic applause from the audience, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign said it had the best hour of fundraising this quarter during the debate.</li> \n   <li>One clear winner of tonight\u2019s debate: <strong>Barack Obama. </strong>Candidates like <strong>Kamala Harris </strong>and Castro started several answers by applauding the work done by the former president\u2019s administration \u2013 which was quite a contrast from the second debate, after which Biden complained that some of his opponents were disparaging Obama\u2019s robust legacy.<br></li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from me on this debate night.

But Biden\u2019s polling advantage appears to be narrowing in recent weeks. Can he pick up lost supporters tonight?</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a></strong>, the Massachusetts senator who enjoyed a steady climb in the polls this summer. Warren has already turned in two solid debate performances, so expectations will be high for the third debate. And it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s faced Biden, but more on that later.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a></strong>, the Vermont senator and two-time presidential candidate running on a progressive platform based around Medicare-for-all. But Sanders has had trouble getting ahead of his fellow progressive senator, Warren.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a></strong>, the California senator who has slipped back to single-digits in polls after a bump from her first debate performance. Harris appears to have slipped from the top tier of candidates and might need a bold move tonight to recover lost ground.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\">Pete Buttigieg</a></strong>, the millennial mayor from Indiana who enjoyed a burst of enthusiasm this spring. But the military veteran has been relatively stagnant since then and could benefit from a standout performance.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/24/andrew-yang-2020-candidate-robots-machines\">Andrew Yang</a></strong>, the tech entrepreneur who has crept ahead of more \u201cestablishment\u201d candidates with his campaign promise of enacting universal basic income. But the real question is: will he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-did-not-wear-tie-to-democratic-debate-2019-6\">wear a tie</a>?</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/beto-o-rourke\">Beto O\u2019Rourke</a></strong>, the former congressman who is back in his home state for this debate. O\u2019Rourke took time away from the campaign trail to help his home town of El Paso heal from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/el-paso-shooting\">mass shooting</a> that left 22 dead. He will likely reference the shooting tonight to demand action on gun control.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cory-booker\">Cory Booker</a></strong>, the New Jersey senator who has struggled to break past 2 percent in polls. He and Biden had a heated discussion about criminal justice reform in the last debate, and the topic is likely to resurface tonight.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amy-klobuchar\">Amy Klobuchar</a></strong>, the Minnesota senator who has argued she has the right message and profile to appeal to Midwestern voters who went for <strong>Trump </strong>in 2016. But she has so far been largely unable to pull voters away from Biden, who has made a similar \u201celectability\u201d argument.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-castro\">Juli\u00e1n Castro</a></strong>, the former housing and urban development secretary who has put immigration at the center of his campaign. The former San Antonio mayor will almost certainly be asked tonight about his plan to <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/juli%C3%A1n-castro-proposal-decriminalize-border-crossing-violations_n_5d1a90fae4b03d6116406ec0\">decriminalize border crossings</a>, a proposal that has now drawn the support of several of his competitors.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>All ten of those candidates will soon take the stage, so stay tuned. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7ad4808f083106f455aa52\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lauren-gambino\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T23:29:17.537Z\">12.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Democrats</strong> have visions of turning the Lone Star state blue. </p> \n  <p>They point to 2018, when now-presidential candidate <strong>Beto O\u2019Rourke</strong> came within 3 percentage points of beating incumbent senator <strong>Ted Cruz</strong>. The last time a Democrat was elected statewide in Texas was 1994. <br></p> \n  <p>Down ballot, Democrats flipped two congressional seats in the state and made major gains at the local level, sweeping Harris County and picking up House and Senate seats. <br></p> \n  <p>The party is gaining traction in the once-reliably Republican suburbs, where college-educated voters and particularly women recoiled from Trump as well as from an expanding Latino electorate that trends overwhelmingly Democratic. <br></p> \n  <p>Five Republican members of Congress from Texas have announced their retirement in recent weeks, a trend Democrats have gleefully dubbed the \u201cTexodus\u201d. They say the Republican departures are indicative of Democrats growing strength in the state. Not all the congressional districts are competitive - but it is a sign that their hope of recapturing the House is increasingly unlikely. House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelos</strong><strong>i</strong> has said she considers Texas \u201cground zero for us next election\u201d. <br></p> \n  <p>Two Texans are running for president: O\u2019Rourke and <strong>Juli\u00e1n Castro</strong>.

      "bodyText": "It was a long night that frequently dove into the weeds of candidates\u2019 specific proposals with a couple explosive moments thrown in along the way. Here are some of the night\u2019s key takeaways: Joe Biden turned in an overall solid performance that was a far cry from his disastrous first debate. But the former vice president\u2019s reference to \u201crecord player\u201d prompted, along with many Twitter jokes, yet another moment of, \u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d And the debate\u2019s most divisive moment came when Juli\u00e1n Castro accused Biden of flip-flopping on healthcare by repeatedly asking him, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro later denied the remark was an attack on Biden\u2019s age, but the question elicited gasps from the audience and immediately recalled Biden\u2019s repeated gaffes in recent weeks. He has, for example, mixed up the locations of recent mass shootings and misidentified the state he was campaigning in. (But it later appeared Castro had mischaracterized Biden\u2019s original comments.) The biggest question going into the debate was whether Biden and Elizabeth Warren, two front-runners who were meeting on a debate stage for the first time, would go after each other. The answer turned out to be: not really. With the exception of Biden\u2019s fumbled reference to \u201cthe senator to my left\u201d at the beginning of the debate, the pair focused on defending their proposals more than anything else. Meanwhile, the other top-polling candidate, Bernie Sanders, successfully inserted himself into many of the night\u2019s most policy-driven discussions on healthcare and foreign policy. The narrowed debate field undeniably changed the dynamics of the event. Without the 10 additional candidates spread across two nights, there appeared to be fewer desperate attempts for attention and more calls to unify as one Democratic field. That suggestion didn\u2019t sit well with Castro, who told Pete Buttigeg at one point, \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d Of the lower-polling candidates, Beto O\u2019Rourke appeared to have the most standout moments. His answers about gun control, coming just a month after the mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, attracted enthusiastic applause from the audience, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign said it had the best hour of fundraising this quarter during the debate. One clear winner of tonight\u2019s debate: Barack Obama. Candidates like Kamala Harris and Castro started several answers by applauding the work done by the former president\u2019s administration \u2013 which was quite a contrast from the second debate, after which Biden complained that some of his opponents were disparaging Obama\u2019s robust legacy. That\u2019s it from me on this debate night. Thanks for following along with the live blog, and be sure to read the Guardian\u2019s other coverage of the night. The question of whether Castro\u2019s attack on Biden was fair appears to be dominating the post-debate chatter, with Cory Booker becoming the latest to weigh in. Booker offered a more mild reproach than Amy Klobuchar, emphasizing that \u201ctone and tenor\u201d are important when having such conversations. But interestingly, Booker heavily implied that he has his own concerns about Biden\u2019s ability to \u201cget the ball over the line.\u201d When specially asked if he was concerned about Biden\u2019s age, Booker offered an emphatic \u201cno,\u201d but the whole answer seems to have a heavy \u201cwink and a nudge\u201d element to it. Here\u2019s an interesting take from the conservative writer Rich Lowry, editor of National Review. He suggests that all three of the Democratic frontrunners represent an electoral risk and if that he was a Democrat he\u2019d be urging the party to look elsewhere. Stacy Abrams, perhaps? Juli\u00e1n Castro claimed his attack on Joe Biden\u2019s healthcare proposals, in which he accused the former vice president of flip-flopping by sarcastically asking if he was \u201cforgetting\u201d what he had said moments before, was not a criticism of Biden\u2019s age. Castro\u2019s repeated question of whether Biden was forgetting what he had said elicited gasps from the audience, who assumed (pretty understandably) that Castro was referencing Biden\u2019s repeated gaffes in recent weeks. The former vice president has, for example, mixed up the sites of recent mass shootings and misidentified the state he was currently campaigning in. The group Sunrise Movement has issued a damning statement on tonight\u2019s debate and what they say is a failure to adequately address the climate crisis. In a statement on Twitter, they said \u201cI don\u2019t know how @DNC leaders can look themselves in the mirror tonight [...] they promised us that they would ensure this issue got the attention it deserved. Tonight their check bounced.\u201d You can read the full statement via their thread here: Pete Buttigieg\u2019s final debate answer on coming out while running for office reminded many viewers of his history-making candidacy as the first major openly gay presidential candidate. And Buttigieg\u2019s own husband applauded his \u201ccourage\u201d in discussing the experience: Here is Buttigieg\u2019s answer, which came in response to a question on the meaning of resilience, in case you missed it: Beto O\u2019Rourke is already moving to capitalize on his biggest line of the night, when he pledged to enact a mandatory buyback of assault weapons. Donald Trump was uncharacteristically silent during the debate, but that\u2019s probably because he spent the beginning of it addressing a House Republican retreat in Baltimore. That didn\u2019t stop his campaign spokesperson from mocking all the Democratic presidential candidates and calling the debate an \u201cinfomercial\u201d for Trump\u2019s re-election. The debate may be over but Joe Biden\u2019s latest gaffe is still spinning. After urging viewers to visit a non-existent website called \u201cJoe 30330\u201d at the end of the last debate, he\u2019s now told children to \u201cmake sure you have the record player on at night\u201d in response to a question about how families should spend their evenings. You can watch it here: And here\u2019s how people have responded Amy Klobuchar said she found Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s criticism of Joe Biden, when he appeared to criticize the former vice president\u2019s age, \u201cnot cool\u201d and compared it to a Trumpian line of attack. Most of the attention going into tonight\u2019s debate was on whether Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren would directly confront each other as they met for the first time on a debate stage. But with the exception of a somewhat haphazard effort by Biden at the beginning to criticize \u201cthe senator to my left,\u201d the two leading candidates remained focused on defending their policies more than anything else. The only candidate who directly confronted Biden was Juli\u00e1n Castro, but that effort didn\u2019t seem to land and may have even be misleading, an ABC News reporter said. Update: the demonstrators who interrupted Joe Biden during the final question of the debate appear to have been immigration protesters, according to a Daily Mail reporter. Moderator Jorge Ramos pushed Biden on the high number of deportations under the Obama administration, but the former vice president defended Obama, arguing the president had done the best he could at the time. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s team appears to be taking a victory lap after his debate performance, which has attracted donors and plaudits. From his rapid response director: O\u2019Rourke\u2019s answers on gun control, in which he repeatedly mentioned the recent mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, in particular attracted enthusiastic applause from the Houston crowd. The debate has concluded \u2013 about 15 minutes earlier than expected, but this blogger is not complaining. We\u2019ll have more post-debate analysis and spin as it comes in, so stay tuned. Beto O\u2019Rourke gave a stirring answer on resiliency by honoring his hometown of El Paso as it continues to heal from the mass shooting that killed 22. He referenced those who are still recovering from their injuries. Amy Klobuchar talked about pushing her state legislature to change the law on hospital stays for mothers with ill newborns after her daughter was born unable to swallow. Juli\u00e1n Castro recounted quitting his high-paying law firm job so that he could vote against a controversial land deal as a member of San Antonio\u2019s city council. A bizarre advert showing a burning photo of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has prompted outrage after playing during an earlier debate break. Paid for by the group New Faces GOP, the ad describes the progressive congresswoman as \u201cthe face of socialism\u201d while issuing a very morbid warning against the economic model. You can see the advert here: Here\u2019s how Ocasio-Cortez has responded: Many others have also expressed their alarm at the advert: Meanwhile, the debate has passed by without any question on reproductive rights, which was a central campaign plank of senator Kirsten Gillibrand. The New York senator dropped out of the race late last month. A former adviser to Gillibrand argued the oversight demonstrated the need for a candidate focused on those issues. This question of what resiliency means to each candidate has given them the chance to dive more into their personal histories. Elizabeth Warren spoke about being discriminated against as a teacher because she was pregnant. Bernie Sanders talked about repeatedly losing races and finally seeing his vision prevail with voters. Kamala Harris repeated her common line of being the first African-American woman to hold several offices and not listening to people telling her it wasn\u2019t her time. Pete Buttigieg talked about coming out as gay while running for office and learning to trust voters with that knowledge. Joe Biden was just beginning his answer on resilience when he was interrupted by a group of protesters in the Houston audience. Once the protesters were cleared out, Biden spoke about his personal tragedies, losing his wife and daughter before being sworn in as a senator and later seeing his son die from brain cancer while he was serving as vice president. A Daily Beast reporter said the optics weren\u2019t the best for the protesters. Moderator Linsey Davis, who previously asked Kamala Harris a tough question about her record on criminal justice, has now posed a similarly difficult question to Joe Biden. Davis specifically asked about Biden\u2019s 1975 comment that he didn\u2019t \u201cfeel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather\u201d when it came to segregation. \u201cThere is institutional segregation in this country,\u201d Biden acknowledged off the bat, claiming he has worked against such discrimination from the beginning of his career. But the former senator has attracted criticism for his past opposition to government-mandated busing to racially integrate schools. When Davis tried to cut off Biden, he said he was going to blow past the time limit like all of his opponents, prompting laughter. But he then oddly segued into an answer on Venezuela, which came up about 20 minutes ago. Kamala Harris used her education answer to trumpet the importance of historically black colleges and universities, one of which she attended (Howard University in Washington). The site of tonight\u2019s debate, Texas Southern University, is also a historically black university \u2013 which may partly explain the healthy applause Harris\u2019 answer attracted. The audience was similarly receptive to Harris\u2019 citations of statistics showing that black children with black teachers are more likely to go on to college. The discussion has turned toward education. Andrew Yang was pressed about his stance toward public education, and the tech entrepreneur emphasized he was \u201cpro-good school\u201d. Pete Buttigieg emphasized teachers need to be better paid so that the positions can attract the best possible candidates. And Elizabeth Warren dismissed claims that she was \u201cin bed with the teacher unions.\u201d Warren emphasized she was the person onstage who has previously been a teacher and argued that educational funding needs to stay in public schools. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign is trying to capitalize on his gun-control answers, which attracted some of the loudest applause of the debate so far, by spinning Elizabeth Warren\u2019s catchphrase, \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d The first climate question has arrived two hours into the debate, much to the chagrin of environmental activists no doubt. Beto O\u2019Rourke pledged to spend $5 trillion to combat the crisis and pursue policies that may be politically unpopular. He referenced the site of the debate, Houston, which suffered devastating losses from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The former congressman said he would pursue disaster relief grants to aid cities like Houston. After O\u2019Rourke completed his answer, many candidates wanted to offer their own plans, so Jorge Ramos said he would try to \u201cquickly\u201d get through them. That sound you hear is every climate activist banging their head against the wall. Along with the climate crisis there\u2019s another topic the candidates haven\u2019t been questioned on tonight: LGBT rights. From Trump\u2019s ban of trans people in the military to his push to allow employers to fire employees based on sexuality and gender identity, the White House\u2019s discriminatory policies have caused huge alarm. Yet so far the issue hasn\u2019t come up once in the debate. The organization Glaad has pointed this out and taken the opportunity to promote its upcoming LGBT forum for candidates. Continuing with the foreign policy discussion, Juli\u00e1n Castro argued the Trump administration should offer Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans fleeing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime. Trump\u2019s government has backed the opposition government in Venezuela but has refrained from offering TPS, even as it has struggled to oust Maduro. Bernie Sanders went after Joe Biden for voting in favor of authorizing the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with the Vermont senator boasting he \u201cnever believed\u201d George W. Bush or Dick Cheney. Biden recently acknowledged he \u201cmisspoke\u201d in an interview when he claimed he quickly came around to opposing the Iraq War. Okay, back to policy. Discussing the potential withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, Elizabeth Warren said the United States needed to stop using the military to address problems that cannot be solved militarily. Pete Buttigieg, the only veteran onstage, accused Congress of ignoring its responsibility to determine the necessity of military action. And he criticized Trump for using troops as \u201cprops.\u201d And Cory Booker just used a foreign-policy question involving Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to make a crack about his baldness, so things are getting a little loose on the debate stage. A PBS NewsHour reporter predicted Kamala Harris\u2019 comparison of Trump to the \u201csmall dude\u201d in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d would likely provoke a response from the president. It reminded some of Republican senator Marco Rubio\u2019s reference to Trump\u2019s \u201csmall hands\u201d during a 2016 primary debate. The candidates have been debating for about an hour and a half now, and there have so far been no questions on the climate crisis. This hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed: Kamala Harris seems determined to direct all of her criticism toward Trump after confronting Joe Biden in the first debate. Directly asked how her trade policy would differ from Barack Obama\u2019s, Harris instead immediately pivoted to saying how her policy would be different from Trump, criticizing him for navigating a trade war over Twitter. She then referenced \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d \u201cYou know, when you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude?\u201d Harris said. Host George Stephanopoulos, who is about 5\u20195\u201d, replied in a deadpan manner, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m not going to take the bait.\u201d Here\u2019s how long each candidate has spoken so far tonight (we\u2019re now halfway through). The candidates are being asked about tariffs and whether they would repeal them on day one of their administrations. Andrew Yang said he wouldn\u2019t. Pete Buttigieg took the opportunity to criticize Trump for fumbling at a crucial moment for \u201cAmerican leadership.\u201d He referenced the president skipping a climate session at the G-7 summit. Asked again about Trump\u2019s trade policy, Buttigieg said he would use the tariffs as leverage as part of his broader strategy. (So that seems like a \u201cno\u201d on the day one question.) Here\u2019s where things stand at halftime: Candidates are directing more of their criticisms toward Trump and away from Barack Obama. Joe Biden had complained after the second debate that some of his opponents were disparaging the former president\u2019s robust legacy. Beto O\u2019Rourke attracted a lot of applause for discussing his gun policies after the mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso. Juli\u00e1n Castro has repeatedly attacked Biden, a potentially risky gamble for a lower-polling candidate. The debate has just returned from its commercial break, so here we go again. The debate has reached its first commercial break, much to the relief of your blogger. About an hour and a half down, an hour and a half to go. Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s repeated attacks on Joe Biden are definitely attracting the attention of political reporters, but it\u2019s very difficult to say whether the gamble will pay off. Juli\u00e1n Castro is striking a notably different tone on Barack Obama\u2019s legacy this time around. During the second debate, Castro, who served as Obama\u2019s housing and urban development secretary, argued the former president had fallen short on immigration. But tonight, Castro began his answer on immigration by emphasizing that Obama was nothing like Trump on the issue. Castro went on to argue that he was continuing the true legacy of Obama. Moderator Jorge Ramos asked Joe Biden about the high number of deportations under the Obama administration. \u201cAre you prepared to say tonight that you and President Obama made a mistake on deportations?\u201d Ramos asked. \u201cWhy should Latinos trust you?\u201d Biden initially deflected, arguing that Obama is nothing like Trump on immigration -- citing the heart-wrenching images of migrant children being held in apparent cages. When pressed by Ramos to answer the initial question, Biden said. \u201cThe president did the best thing that was able to be done.\u201d Ramos asked, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Biden simply replied, \u201cI\u2019m the vice president of the United States.\u201d (Well, he was, but you get the idea.) Elizabeth Warren is calling for the end of the Senate filibuster to enact gun-control legislation. If the filibuster was done away with, it would only take 50 Senate votes to pass a bill; legislation can currently be blocked if it attracts less than 60 votes. Bernie Sanders said he would not end the filibuster but argued there were other legislative means to pass major legislation on issues like gun control and climate change. O\u2019Rourke did not shy away from saying he would require citizens to turn in their military-style weapons, despite Republicans\u2019 frequent accusations that Democrats are coming to take Americans\u2019 guns. \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AK-47,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in one of the biggest lines of the night so far. The moderators specifically turned to Beto O\u2019Rourke to answer a question on gun policy, given that his hometown just suffered a mass shooting. Discussing his policy for a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons, the former congressman received some of the biggest applause of the night. Kamala Harris took a question on gun control and also applauded Beto O\u2019Rourke for his attention to El Paso after the mass shooting there. The California senator then implicated Trump in the white nationalist shooting, saying that the president may not have pulled the trigger but has been \u201ctweeting out the ammunition.\u201d Joe Biden is taking a question on gun control and once again arguing he has the best (and certainly the longest) record on the issue. \u201cI\u2019m the only one up here who\u2019s ever beat the NRA,\u201d the former vice president and senator said. Biden then similarly applauded Beto O\u2019Rourke for his efforts to help his hometown of El Paso heal from the mass shooting that killed 22. Biden originally referred to the former congressman as \u201cBeto.\u201d He then apologized and O\u2019Rourke interjected, \u201cBeto is good.\u201d In the midst of a discussion on race and criminal justice, Ari Berman, author of Give Us the Ballot, has made this important point: Here\u2019s the tense moment Castro went after Biden over his healthcare proposals \u2013 and accused him of contradicting himself onstage. Amy Klobuchar was similarly asked about her record on criminal justice reform, demonstrating how multiple candidates (including Joe Biden) have complicated histories on the issue. Kamala Harris was asked about how her criminal justice plan does not match with the policies she pursued as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney and California\u2019s attorney general. Moderator Linsey Davis asked this searing question: \u201cWhen you had the power, why didn\u2019t you try to affect change then?\u201d The question attracted applause, and Harris thanked Davis for asking it. She went on to say her plan has been praised by criminal justice advocates and arguing she tried to affect change from the inside as a prosecutor. Harris cited certain changes she made in her past roles, but the question itself demonstrated how this is a lingering controversy hanging over her candidacy. Beto O\u2019Rourke pledged to sign a reparations bill into law as president, something that Marianne Williamson spoke of in the last debate. (But Williamson is not onstage tonight.) O\u2019Rourke also touched on the white nationalist shooting in his hometown of El Paso, prompting a compliment from Castro about how eloquently the former congressman has spoken about the violence that impacted his community. Castro went after O\u2019Rourke, his fellow Texan, in the first debate, so the compliment was noteworthy. Andrew Yang has unveiled his surprise announcement of the night to mixed reviews. During his opening remarks he told the audience his campaign is giving 10 American families $1,000 a month for a year \u2013 mirroring his plan to roll out a universal basic income scheme nationwide. His competition has been welcomed by his supporters but received quite a cynical response from other camps: After Castro and Biden\u2019s tense exchange, Pete Buttigieg tried to bring the candidates together by saying that moments like these are why primary debates are becoming \u201cunwatchable.\u201d But Castro interjected, \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d Harris then tried to also strike a note of harmony by saying, \u201cA house divided cannot stand.\u201d But that comment did not seem to elicit much applause. Biden and Castro just got into a tense exchange about health care, in which Castro accused the former vice president of flip-flopping from what he said just moments ago. In a moment that elicited gasps from the audience, Castro asked Biden, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d The repeated question likely struck a chord, given Biden\u2019s repeated gaffes in recent weeks where he has mixed up, for example, the sites of mass shootings. Juli\u00e1n Castro continued with the Obama praise, saying the American people owe the former Democratic president a debt of gratitude. Castro, Obama\u2019s former housing and urban development secretary, distanced himself from the president\u2019s immigration policy in the last debate. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders continue to dive into the weeds of their health care plans. When Sanders specifically referenced the potential case of a cancer patient, Biden interjected, \u201cI know a lot about cancer, and let me tell you something.\u201d Biden lost his son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015. Okay, so this is a notable and clearly purposeful shift from the second debate. Biden complained after that debate that he felt his opponents were too critical of Obama\u2019s legacy, a gripe that seemed to register with some Democratic voters. So this time around, candidates are making a point to thank Obama for his contribution. Kamala Harris started her answer on health care by thanking Obama and Sanders for their contribution to the US health care system before calling out Trump\u2019s efforts to gut the Affordable Care Act. But that allowed her to sidestep a question on why she rescinded her support for Medicare-for-all. Buttigieg said Medicare-for-all doesn\u2019t \u201ctrust the American people\u201d because it takes options away, such as private insurance. Sanders replied that private insurance can be unstable because of its connection to employment, resulting in people losing health coverage if they lose their jobs. Klobuchar, who slammed some of her opponents for being too extreme in her opening statement, used her answer on health care to note she and Sanders have worked together to lower prescription drug prices. But then she went in for the kill. \u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d Klobuchar said of Medicare-for-all. She emphasized the tens of millions of people who would lose their private insurance under the plan. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bold idea; I think that\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d Klobuchar said. Biden asserted his plan, which would expand upon Obamacare, would give Americans more options than Medicare-for-all. He noted people would have the option to stay with their plans if they liked it. Warren replied with this line that could be one of her biggest of the night: \u201cI\u2019ve never actually met anybody who likes their health-insurance company,\u201d she said. Sanders, taking his first question on health care, reiterated his line from the second debate writing \u201cthe damn bill\u201d on Medicare-for-all. It seemed to get a bigger response last time. The Vermont senator said America could not afford to continue with the \u201cstatus quo\u201d and argued that it would cost less money over time to go with a single-payer system. Warren defended her health care proposals, saying they would allow middle-class families to pay less for their insurance. She emphasized that costs would go up for wealthy Americans and corporations, but they would go down for average families. Joe Biden took his first question, on health care, to tie Elizabeth Warren to Bernie Sanders while linking himself to Barack Obama. The former vice president said Warren is \u201cfor Bernie,\u201d while he is \u201cfor Barack.\u201d Biden oddly avoided saying either Warren or Sanders\u2019 names, repeatedly referring to them as \u201cthe senator.\u201d Joe Biden touted the message of American exceptionalism, arguing opportunities will be limitless once the country removes its current president. \u201cThere\u2019s enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said. After an awkwardly long pause, Bernie Sanders launched into his opening statement, which was somewhat hobbled by his apparent cold. That could be a problem over the next three hours as the Vermont senator debates his opponents. Elizabeth Warren referenced her history to the University of Houston just down the road from the debate site and promised to offer the same opportunities to American families. Pete Buttigieg referenced the September 11 anniversary in his opening statement. The Indiana mayor is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. Kamala Harris directly addressed Trump in her opening statement, saying the only reason he was not indicted was because of a policy warning against indicting a sitting president. The California senator said she knew Trump was watching the debate. When she concluded, Harris told the president he could \u201cgo back to watching Fox News.\u201d Presidential candidate or game show host? Andrew Yang just followed through on his promise to offer a year of his promised universal basic income to 10 people if they go to his campaign website. The offer was met with laughter \u2013 both in the media room here in Houston and apparently onstage, as one of the other candidates could be heard chuckling. Beto O\u2019Rourke used his opening statement to remind the audience of the mass shooting that shook his hometown of El Paso last month. The attack by a white nationalist left 22 people dead, and O\u2019Rourke has since been even more vocal about his support for gun control, including a mandatory buyback of assault weapons. Juli\u00e1n Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio, pledged in his opening statement that Texas would turn blue next year. Amy Klobuchar offered this punny warning about Trump\u2019s presidency: \u201cHouston, we have a problem.\u201d Get it? Because we\u2019re in Houston, guys! Brilliant. But Klobuchar also took aim at the more progressive candidates onstage, offering a \u201cbetter way\u201d to combat the nation\u2019s problems. ABC News host George Stephanopoulos opened the debate by emphasizing that it is a first for the 2020 Democratic primary. \u201cA single debate in a single night with all the top candidates facing off,\u201d the host said. Anchor Jorge Ramos, another moderator, offered a Spanish introduction that he then translated into English. Ramos said in his translation that Latinos in America were facing \u201cdifficult times,\u201d but he added, \u201cThis is our country, too.\u201d The candidates have taken the stage, and ABC News\u2019 montage of the participating candidates has started. Stay tuned for the opening statements. ABC News made a point to emphasize to candidates before the debate that this is a family network, folks. \u201cWe wanted to take this opportunity to remind you that, as the debate will air on the ABC broadcast network, we are governed by Federal Communications Commission indecency rules,\u201d Rick Klein, the network\u2019s political director, wrote in a memo forwarded to the campaigns. Klein added: \u201cCandidates should therefore avoid cursing or expletives in accordance with federal law.\u201d One candidate in particular, Beto O\u2019Rourke, has made headlines for repeatedly cursing to express his frustration with inaction on gun control. Maybe if he says it in Spanish, the network won\u2019t bleep him? The format of tonight\u2019s debates will be very similar to the first two with candidates receiving one minute and 15 seconds for direct responses to questions and 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals. The candidates will deliver opening statements, but no closing statements \u2013 which is a change from the second debate. And the debate will be moderated by four of ABC News\u2019 hosts: George Stephanopoulos, David Muir, Linsey Davis and Jorge Ramos. Most debate viewers\u2019 eyes will be glued to center stage tonight, where two front-runners will confront each other for the first time: Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Despite a number of recent gaffes, Biden has held on to his polling edge, but Warren has recently chipped away at his advantage as the Massachusetts senator has repeatedly finished neck-and-neck with Bernie Sanders. But unlike Sanders, whose polling has been relatively stagnant, Warren has enjoyed a steady rise over the summer. The contrast between Biden and Warren reflects the question at the heart of this primary race: should Democrats play it safe with a well-known establishment candidate promising to build on Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, or bet the house with a more progressive candidate demanding systematic change? Moderators will likely ask this very question tonight in an attempt to bait Biden and Warren into a fight over their grander vision for the future. If they do, will Sanders try to jump into the fray by presenting himself as the truer progressive? Or will he and Warren tag-team the more moderate candidates, as they did during the second debate? We\u2019ll find out in the next couple of hours. Many environmental activists are hoping climate change will be a central theme of tonight\u2019s debate, particularly given that the city hosting the debate has experienced the most devastating effects of extreme weather. Hurricane Harvey struck Houston two years ago, destroying thousands of homes and claiming at least 68 lives. In recent years, such \u201c500-year\u201d storms have become increasingly common. The Bahamas are the latest tragic example of that trend, as the country wrestles with the devastation wrought by Hurricane Dorian. Environmental activists complained that the first two debates spent too little time discussing what they consider the defining crisis of our time. And they have lost their greatest champion in the 2020 field, Washington governor Jay Inslee \u2013 who based his campaign around combating the climate crisis but dropped out last month. In the time since, more candidates have released their climate proposals, and CNN hosted a seven-hour (yes, seven-hour) town hall solely dedicated to the issue. But many who fear time is running out on halting the earth\u2019s warming hope the issue will receive more coverage in tonight\u2019s debate. She occupied a unique space in the first two debates, framing the problem of taking on Donald Trump as a national psychic challenge, asking America to let love rule and making a powerful call for slavery reparations. But tonight, self-help author Marianne Williamson, not having garnered the requisite polling and donor numbers to make the cut, will be watching the debate from home. Assuming she doesn\u2019t TiVo it. If the point of the presidential debates is to showcase the range of ideas about how to lead the country and in which direction, it\u2019s tempting to wonder what good it does to have seven members or former members of Congress onstage \u2013 with all the repetitive and dull political speech that mix is bound to produce \u2013 but to exclude a candidate who made herself a standout, and was a clear crowd-pleaser, back in July with lines like this: \u201cIf you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I\u2019m afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days. We need to say it like it is... \u201c Maybe next time? Williamson hit the debate\u2019s donor threshold, so she could still appear in No.4 if she gets those polling numbers up. We\u2019re about a half an hour away from the debate\u2019s start time, so here is a refresher on who will appear onstage tonight. Joe Biden, the former vice president who continues to lead in polls despite a number of recent gaffes. But Biden\u2019s polling advantage appears to be narrowing in recent weeks. Can he pick up lost supporters tonight? Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who enjoyed a steady climb in the polls this summer. Warren has already turned in two solid debate performances, so expectations will be high for the third debate. And it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s faced Biden, but more on that later. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and two-time presidential candidate running on a progressive platform based around Medicare-for-all. But Sanders has had trouble getting ahead of his fellow progressive senator, Warren. Kamala Harris, the California senator who has slipped back to single-digits in polls after a bump from her first debate performance. Harris appears to have slipped from the top tier of candidates and might need a bold move tonight to recover lost ground. Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor from Indiana who enjoyed a burst of enthusiasm this spring. But the military veteran has been relatively stagnant since then and could benefit from a standout performance. Andrew Yang, the tech entrepreneur who has crept ahead of more \u201cestablishment\u201d candidates with his campaign promise of enacting universal basic income. But the real question is: will he wear a tie? Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former congressman who is back in his home state for this debate. O\u2019Rourke took time away from the campaign trail to help his home town of El Paso heal from a mass shooting that left 22 dead. He will likely reference the shooting tonight to demand action on gun control. Cory Booker, the New Jersey senator who has struggled to break past 2 percent in polls. He and Biden had a heated discussion about criminal justice reform in the last debate, and the topic is likely to resurface tonight. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who has argued she has the right message and profile to appeal to Midwestern voters who went for Trump in 2016. But she has so far been largely unable to pull voters away from Biden, who has made a similar \u201celectability\u201d argument. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing and urban development secretary who has put immigration at the center of his campaign. The former San Antonio mayor will almost certainly be asked tonight about his plan to decriminalize border crossings, a proposal that has now drawn the support of several of his competitors. All ten of those candidates will soon take the stage, so stay tuned. The Democrats have visions of turning the Lone Star state blue. They point to 2018, when now-presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke came within 3 percentage points of beating incumbent senator Ted Cruz. The last time a Democrat was elected statewide in Texas was 1994. Down ballot, Democrats flipped two congressional seats in the state and made major gains at the local level, sweeping Harris County and picking up House and Senate seats. The party is gaining traction in the once-reliably Republican suburbs, where college-educated voters and particularly women recoiled from Trump as well as from an expanding Latino electorate that trends overwhelmingly Democratic. Five Republican members of Congress from Texas have announced their retirement in recent weeks, a trend Democrats have gleefully dubbed the \u201cTexodus\u201d. They say the Republican departures are indicative of Democrats growing strength in the state. Not all the congressional districts are competitive - but it is a sign that their hope of recapturing the House is increasingly unlikely. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she considers Texas \u201cground zero for us next election\u201d. Two Texans are running for president: O\u2019Rourke and Juli\u00e1n Castro. Both have suggested that Texas\u2019s electoral treasure chest would be up for grabs if they were on the ticket. But demographic shifts won\u2019t happen overnight and the odds remain long that the state will turn the state blue in 2020. Still, Democrats are poised to make some gains \u2013 and if everything\u2019s bigger in Texas, the political fight here will be one to watch. We may have an answer to what big, unprecedented surprise Andrew Yang will reveal at tonight\u2019s debate, and it is ... rather underwhelming. But the Democratic presidential candidates who missed the debate stage this time around \u2013 including Steve Bullock, Tom Steyer and Tim Ryan\u2013 are showing no signs of calling it quits. Bullock, the Montana governor, offered this oh-so-subtle Twitter message earlier today: And Ryan and Steyer are holding events in the early voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa. Ryan has said he may continue on with his bid even if he doesn\u2019t make the cut for the fourth debate, so he\u2019s definitely in this for the long haul. \u201cIf I\u2019m doing well in September, October in polling, we\u2019ll probably just keep going,\u201d Ryan told Bloomberg News last week. Ten candidates! Three hours! One night only! How we got from 20 candidates over two nights to 10 candidates over a single night says a lot about where we are in the Democratic primary race. The stakes are getting higher and the threshold for qualifying is getting tougher. To qualify for the debate in Houston and the next one in Ohio, candidates had to amass 130,000 individual donors and capture 2% in four qualifying polls. The threshold is the same for the October debate. To be sure, this isn\u2019t an impossibly hard task, especially considering the position they\u2019re running for and how jazzed Democrats are about 2020. But a massive field and a Trump-obsessed media landscape have made it difficult for candidates to break through. Four candidates bowed to that reality and left the race after it was clear they wouldn\u2019t qualify for the debates: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, John Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee and Seth Moulton. There are still 10 candidates running for president who did not qualify for the debate. Among them, Tom Steyer, the activist billionaire, says he has met the threshold for the October debate and congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is close to qualifying. Their inclusion could push the debates back to two nights. The remaining candidates spend much of their time on the trail defending their continued presence in a race that many primary voters believe is simply too big. Democrats like Montana Governor Steve Bullock and Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, both Democrats elected in states that voted for Trump, are testing new ways to draw attention. Bullock published a BuzzFeed listicle of \u201cdad jokes that are just as groan-worthy as they are funny\u201d while Ryan released a Spotify playlist of his key policy planks. The Democratic presidential candidates participating in tonight\u2019s debate have been preparing for the big event with their families. Amy Klobuchar and Juli\u00e1n Castro both posted tweets with their children in the hours before the debate: And Kamala Harris\u2019 husband shared a photo of the California senator before she hits the stage: It\u2019s well known that healthcare was the biggest issue among voters in the 2018 midterms. But it\u2019s still astonishing to see just how much this is the case when measured in Google search interest. In the below maps, which show the most searched for issues in three early-voting states in the Democratic primary, you can see how much healthcare (colored grey) dominates almost every district in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Iowa New Hampshire South Carolina Senator, senator, mayor, senator, ex-veep, senator, senator, former congressman, former secretary, Andrew Yang. One of these things is not like the other, and he is Yang, an entrepreneur and philanthropist whose personal charisma and unique platform \u2013 curb automation, add a universal basic income \u2013 have produced a surprisingly potent presidential bid. Yang not only racked up the poll numbers and donor totals to win a place in the third debate \u2013 he is noticeably, and remarkably, closer to the center of the stage than some pretty big names like Beto O\u2019Rourke and Cory Booker. Positions onstage are awarded by polling average, with the best performers in the middle. Here\u2019s the order: senator Amy Klobuchar, Booker, mayor Pete Buttigieg, senator Bernie Sanders, former vice president Joe Biden, senator Elizabeth Warren, senator Kamala Harris, Andrew Yang, O\u2019Rourke and former HUD secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. Will Yang take advantage of tonight\u2019s debate to move even closer to the middle next time? Apparently he has a plan in store for tonight: And he\u2019s not offering any spoilers before the big event: Good evening, live blog readers! I\u2019m here in Houston waiting for the third Democratic debate to kick off in about an hour and half at Texas Southern University, a historically black university. As a reminder, tonight is the only night of the third debate \u2013 unlike the first two, which were two-night events. Because only 10 candidates qualified this time around, the stage has shrunk considerably. But don\u2019t worry: ABC News has kindly scheduled the debate to last for three hours to make up for that loss. The blog will dive more into who missed the debate stage \u2013 and why \u2013 a bit closer to the event\u2019s 8pm ET start time, but for now, enjoy this video of senator Cory Booker preparing for the debate by repeatedly trying to adjust his podium. All the fireworks are still to come, so stay tuned.",

The researchers said financial stress among those on Newstart had surged from about 50% in 2003 to 65% in 2015, despite financial stress across all households falling by 1.3 percentage points over the same period. \u201cThe analysis \u2026 shows that poverty and financial stress rates remained relatively steady for most household types in recent decades,\u201d the paper said. \u201cHowever, households where allowances (mostly Newstart) are the main source of income have experienced significant increases in both poverty and financial stress. \u201cMost households (72%) with an allowance recipient, allowances are not their main source of income. However, households with at least one allowee still have significantly higher poverty and financial stress rates compared to other households, including pensioner households, and the trend since 1993 has been for these rates to increase.\u201d For the third time on Thursday the Senate passed a motion backing a Newstart increase as welfare recipients from the Australian Unemployed Workers Union visited Canberra seeking meetings with federal politicians.",

But the debate also took a more conciliatory tone than previous ones as rival candidates praised each other and concentrated much of their fire in the direction of Donald Trump. Round three of the presidential debates, held on Thursday at Texas Southern University, a historically black college in Houston, featured all of the top contenders for the party\u2019s nomination on a single stage for the first time. The sprawling metropolis, one of the most diverse cities in America, reflected the diversity of the Democratic field, which featured women, people of color and a gay man. Over the course of three hours, Democrats debated a central question animating the primary contest: do they want to return to an era of politics that existed before the Trump presidency or do they favor policies that go far beyond the last administration? \u201cI stand with Barack Obama, all eight years, the good, bad and indifferent,\u201d Biden said, defending himself against an attack on his record. \ufeffThe ABC News debate opened with a clash over healthcare, one of the sharpest differences among the candidates and a top priority for Democratic voters. Wrapping himself in Obama\u2019s legacy, the former vice-president confronted his progressive challengers over the cost of Medicare for All, which would cover every American under a government health plan and essentially eliminate private insurance, accusing Warren of not being forthcoming about whether the plan would raise taxes on the middle class. \u201cI know the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d he said of Warren\u2019s support for Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All healthcare plan. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack.

Salam\u00e9 told the security council: \u201cIt remains abundantly clear that without the commitment of key external actors engaged in Libya, the conflict will continue.\u201d</p> <p>Underlining the scale of the breach of the UN\u2019s authority, he told the UN: \u201cThe violence in Libya is exacerbated by the supply of additional arms, ammunition and war materiel into the country.

      "bodyText": "Germany is planning to hold a UN-backed international conference on the future of Libya in an attempt to force the many regional actors to stop funding and arming the country\u2019s warring sides. The UN has admitted its strengthened arms embargo on the country has been totally ignored by a range of countries, including Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. The UN special envoy, Ghassan Salam\u00e9, has come to the view that unless an international spotlight is thrown on the role of the many regional actors, the war will continue indefinably, possibly turning the country into a new Syria. Speaking in Berlin on Thursday, Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, hinted at the problems ahead in terms of the aims and guest list for the conference, saying there would be a lot of work to organise such a meeting. Some countries are unlikely to attend if they believe they are going to be put in the dock for backing one side or another. Maas added: \u201cGermany wants to launch a consultation process with all relevant actors. There is still a lot of work before we can have such a conference. But we have started working on a process.\u201d Two previous conferences in the last year, one in Palermo and another in Paris, failed to bring about any breakthrough before Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the military commander in the east of Libya, tried to capture the capital, Tripoli, the seat of the UN-recognised government. Salam\u00e9 has been touting the idea of a conference for more than two months and in an address to the UN security council called for a three-stage process, including local ceasefires, a national conference and then a national meeting inside Libya. Maas stressed his work was in support of Salam\u00e9, who has been touring European and Middle East capitals in support of his conference plan. Salam\u00e9 told the security council: \u201cIt remains abundantly clear that without the commitment of key external actors engaged in Libya, the conflict will continue.\u201d Underlining the scale of the breach of the UN\u2019s authority, he told the UN: \u201cThe violence in Libya is exacerbated by the supply of additional arms, ammunition and war materiel into the country. Violations of the arms embargo have been both routine and often blatant by both of the main parties to the conflict and their respective sponsor member states.\u201d He revealed the UN panel of experts was investigating over 40 cases of arms embargo breaches of varying magnitude, despite non-cooperation by most of the perpetrator member states. \u201cIt is sadly true to say that the arms embargo has been ineffective since 4 April 2019,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThere have been no interdictions or searches conducted at sea, despite such activities being authorised by UN resolutions The reported recent arrival of thousands of mercenaries into the country risks the further extension and escalation of the conflict.\u201d He said the purpose of the conference was to \u201csend a strong message on the need for respect of the arms embargo, to commit to non-interference in Libyan affairs and to address the main causes of conflict as formulated by the Libyans themselves and to emphasise its clear and active support for whatever political formula the Libyans agree to.\u201d With the French president, Emmanuel Macron, focused on brokering peace in Iran, the Italians busy bedding down a new coalition government and Britain preoccupied by Brexit, Germany became the natural European hosts for the conference, and is seen as largely neutral in the conflict between Tripoli and Haftar.

The supreme court will rule next week.</p> <h2>So what happens now?</h2> <p>Not for the first time in the Brexit saga, that is the \u00a3350m-a-week question. Britain is certainly \u2013 again not for the first time \u2013 an <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-how-bad-is-boris-johnson-we-cant-even-find-the-words/\">international laughing stock</a>. But where we go from here is still not much clearer than it was before that long, quiet summer. Commentators see four main options.</p> <p>First, Johnson could <strong>still get a deal</strong>, perhaps by agreeing to the EU\u2019s original proposal to resolve the Ireland problem: creating a border in the Irish sea. Winning parliamentary approval would be very hard, but perhaps possible \u2013 Labour MPs in leave-voting constituencies want to deliver, and Tory hardliners may see this as their last chance.</p> <p>Second, he could <strong>break his promise</strong>, request an extension and then immediately demand an election, counting on a fiercely anti-EU, people-versus-parliament campaign to see him through. This could, however, leave him vulnerable to a squeeze from both the Brexit party and (possibly) a coordinated opposition promising a second referendum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72e28015e53a98e3bb7e1e7916fbce8bf0dbbf7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72e28015e53a98e3bb7e1e7916fbce8bf0dbbf7d/0_0_5400_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn speaks in the House of Commons on 3 September\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn speaks in the House of Commons on 3 September</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger Harris/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Third, he could go <strong>full no deal on 31 October as he promised, </strong>ignoring the law (or at least testing it to its limits in the courts). He could then call an early election after the UK leaves the EU, trusting that with Brexit delivered, the Brexit party will be no more \u2013 and hoping that no deal is not so catastrophic that the country does not give him a kicking.</p> <p>Finally, he could be <strong>pushed out</strong> by a no-confidence vote or step down of his own accord. Rather than the divisive Jeremy Corbyn, a more neutral figure (Ken Clarke?) might then head up a temporary government whose sole purpose would be to ask the EU for an extension. Elections would then follow which, if he campaigned for no deal, Johnson could conceivably win.</p> <p>Will the EU27 play ball? They are, certainly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/eu-losing-patience-britain-dutch-minister\">rapidly running </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/eu-losing-patience-britain-dutch-minister\">out of patience</a>. Most now would really like the UK just to go as soon as possible. They will never throw Ireland under the bus by ditching the backstop - but if no deal could still be avoided, they would be pleased.</p> <p>A good reason (elections, a new government) would be needed, but it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/brexit-extension-would-the-eu-grant-one-if-the-uk-requests-it\">hard to see even Emmanuel Macron</a> refusing a request for an extension intended to avoid no deal.</p> <p>No one wants to be seen to be actively helping the UK over the cliff edge.</p>",

Many of the Conservative rebels said their resolve had been strengthened rather than shaken by the prime minister\u2019s bullying. Their subsequent sackings \u2013 by text message\u2013 enraged moderate Conservatives who lamented what they called the transformation of their previously broad-church party into a narrow, extremist Brexit sect. Within a week of parliament\u2019s return, Johnson had suffered an unprecedented six consecutive parliamentary defeats, including two on motions of his own demanding an early election: perhaps not surprisingly, his rebel purge having left him with a majority of minus 41, he failed to get the required two-thirds of MPs\u2019 votes. Rebel and opposition MPs alike by now had so little trust in Johnson that they refused to allow any fresh elections until they were sure an extension had been secured and a no-deal Brexit on 31 October ruled out. Even his own brother, Jo, quit the cabinet, citing a conflict between \u201cfamily loyalty and the national interest\u201d. Amid unprecedented scenes in parliament, the prime minister on Monday went ahead with his decision to suspend parliament until 14 October. But there was one more twist: sensationally, Scottish judges declared his move was aimed at silencing parliament and was therefore unlawful. The supreme court will rule next week. So what happens now? Not for the first time in the Brexit saga, that is the \u00a3350m-a-week question. Britain is certainly \u2013 again not for the first time \u2013 an international laughing stock. But where we go from here is still not much clearer than it was before that long, quiet summer. Commentators see four main options. First, Johnson could still get a deal, perhaps by agreeing to the EU\u2019s original proposal to resolve the Ireland problem: creating a border in the Irish sea. Winning parliamentary approval would be very hard, but perhaps possible \u2013 Labour MPs in leave-voting constituencies want to deliver, and Tory hardliners may see this as their last chance. Second, he could break his promise, request an extension and then immediately demand an election, counting on a fiercely anti-EU, people-versus-parliament campaign to see him through. This could, however, leave him vulnerable to a squeeze from both the Brexit party and (possibly) a coordinated opposition promising a second referendum. Third, he could go full no deal on 31 October as he promised, ignoring the law (or at least testing it to its limits in the courts). He could then call an early election after the UK leaves the EU, trusting that with Brexit delivered, the Brexit party will be no more \u2013 and hoping that no deal is not so catastrophic that the country does not give him a kicking. Finally, he could be pushed out by a no-confidence vote or step down of his own accord. Rather than the divisive Jeremy Corbyn, a more neutral figure (Ken Clarke?) might then head up a temporary government whose sole purpose would be to ask the EU for an extension. Elections would then follow which, if he campaigned for no deal, Johnson could conceivably win. Will the EU27 play ball? They are, certainly, rapidly running out of patience. Most now would really like the UK just to go as soon as possible. They will never throw Ireland under the bus by ditching the backstop - but if no deal could still be avoided, they would be pleased. A good reason (elections, a new government) would be needed, but it is hard to see even Emmanuel Macron refusing a request for an extension intended to avoid no deal. No one wants to be seen to be actively helping the UK over the cliff edge.",

      "bodyText": "Government MPs have launched an extraordinary attack on the corporate regulator Asic for deciding to appeal a responsible lending case it lost against Westpac which has become known as the \u201cwagyu beef and shiraz\u201d judgment. During an at-times fiery parliamentary hearing on Friday morning, Victorian Liberal senator James Paterson, New South Wales Liberal MP Jason Falinski, and Queensland LNP MP Bert Van Manen repeatedly questioned Australian Securities and Investments Commission officers about why the regulator decided to appeal the judgment to the full court of the federal court. The position of the backbenchers appears at odds with the government\u2019s often-stated position that Asic was supposed to be a \u201ctough cop on the beat\u201d and urgings from last year\u2019s banking royal commission for the regulator to be more willing to take legal action. In the Westpac case, Asic accused the bank of failing to meet responsible lending standards between 2011 and 2014 by using a benchmark to measure ability to repay, instead of actual expenses. But last month judge Nye Perram threw the case out, saying Westpac did take into account expenses declared by borrowers and customers could trim their expenses after taking out a loan. Sparking outrage from consumer groups, Perram said: \u201cI may eat wagyu beef every day, washed down with the finest shiraz but, if I really want my new home, I can make do on much more modest fare.\u201d The judgment came amid unhappiness by regulators at the courts over a series of rulings that limited their ability to pursue companies over allegations they have poorly treated their customers. On Friday morning, the government MPs spent more than an hour grilling Asic chairman James Shipton and other commissioners about the appeal. Paterson, a former executive at rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs, accused Asic of lacking hard evidence that Westpac\u2019s practices caused any harm to consumers and relying on anecdotal statements from consumer groups. The harm postulated by Asic seemed hypothetical and in the future, he said. He asked: \u201cDoes that mean in short that no there is no evidence of harm?\u201d Shipton said the lawsuit was \u201ca preventative measure\u201d. \u201cWe decided on the basis of all the inputs that ultimately certainty would be provided by pursuing this appeal,\u201d he said. Falinski said Perram\u2019s judgment showed that Asic got its facts wrong when bringing the case. \u201cIt was a pretty damning judgment, wasn\u2019t it,\u201d he said. He was concerned that Asic\u2019s attitude might stop competition in home lending from new companies who wanted to use technology to assess applications. \u201cWhat appears to be at the core of this is the belief of Asic and the legal community in Australia that creating algorithms is in breach of the law,\u201d he said. Shipton\u2019s response \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s not what we\u2019re saying\u201d \u2013 was met with a deep sigh from Falinski. \u201cAsic is making it very difficult for this oversight committee,\u201d Falinski said. \u201cWe have asked over and over again what the evidence is \u2026 there seems to be be no evidence this was causing actual harm.\u201d",

James said union officials had demanded entry to the site on the pretence that workers had blown the whistle about specific safety issues.

James said none of those \u201cminor\u201d issues was related to the union\u2019s stated grounds for entry. The footage also shows James attempting to physically block union representatives from accessing the site. Over the past 14 months CFMEU attempts to exercise entry rights at Enco work sites have devolved into alleged abusive confrontations, court cases and complaints to the state\u2019s corruption watchdog. James has become a face of construction industry resistance to union entry in Queensland. In May, the union won a landmark ruling when a magistrate, Wendy Cull, dismissed trespass charges against union officials who had been arrested at Enco despite holding a legal right of entry. Cull awarded $85,000 in costs against the police and said officers had \u201ctaken the side of the business owner\u201d. James said police were now \u201ctoo scared\u201d to act when union officials turned up and demanded access. In August, after Enco complained to the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission, the state\u2019s Office of Industrial Relations launched an investigation into claims government officials passed confidential information to the union about Enco. The complaint also alleged a public servant was put under pressure to lodge an anonymous complaint about Enco to later enable the CFMEU to enter the site. James has previously complained about being abused by union officials. The CFMEU state secretary, Michael Ravbar, said Enco was \u201ca rogue operator, with a reputation for cutting corners in everything they do, who even tried to use the industrial commission to prevent inspectors visiting the site\u201d. \u201cYou have to ask, when a company is that desperate to avoid proper scrutiny, what is it trying to hide? \u201cThis is a management team that treats its employees with contempt.\u201d James said none of his employees were union members and that \u201cnone want to join\u201d. He said he \u201cpushed back\u201d at the union because his business had been unfairly targeted. \u201cUnfortunately they just went after us because we were supplying to some jobs they didn\u2019t have a good run on,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The first president of Timor Leste has paid a touching visit to the bedside of the Indonesian president who granted the region a referendum on independence in 1999, before his death on Wednesday night. A video circulating on social media shows Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, who became president of Timor Leste after the country achieved independence in 1999, visiting BJ Habibie in hospital in Jakarta. An apparently emotional Gusm\u00e3o speaks quietly to Habibie before kissing him on the forehead. Habibie then reaches out and embraces Gusm\u00e3o, who lays his head on Habibie\u2019s chest. The 83-year-old Habibie had been suffering from heart failure, his son Tariq Kemal Habibie told Metro TV late on Wednesday. After his death, Gusm\u00e3o sent a wreath of flowers in honour of the former president, calling Habibie a \u201cbig brother\u201d and saying: \u201cTimorese people will remember you forever.\u201d The emotional moment between the former leaders comes just a few weeks after the 20th anniversary of East Timorese independence, which came after the referendum. Habibie became president of Indonesia in 1998, taking over from General Suharto, who had ruled the world\u2019s most populous Muslim majority country with an iron fist for 32 years. Habibie held power for just 17 months but in an abrupt change to long-held policy, he agreed to the referendum for the people of former Portuguese colony East Timor, which had been annexed in 1976 following an invasion by Indonesian troops in December 1975. The decision to allow the people a referendum was hugely controversial and the vote unleashed a wave of violence. It also paved the way for Gusm\u00e3o, who was a former resistance leader with East Timor\u2019s Falintil forces and had been incarcerated in Cipinang prison for seven years, to be released from prison later that year.",

      "bodyText": "Faced with an advertiser exodus of more than 110 brands, Macquarie Media has written to advertisers promising a review of Alan Jones\u2019 program, which it says failed to meet community standards. Jones apologised last month to the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, for his comments that Scott Morrison should shove a sock down her throat, but this failed to stem the flow of advertisers, and 2GB and 4BC have continued to haemorrhage revenue. The chairman of Macquarie Media, Russell Tate, wrote to advertisers on Friday to apologise for the comments about Ardern and \u201cany disruption caused to your company as a result of remarks made by him\u201d. \u201cAlan and I are happy to talk and meet with as many of our advertisers as possible over the next two months to hear your views on how we can best serve your business, but in the meantime, I would be very interested to hear any comments or thoughts which can help us do that. \u201cThis incident has brought into sharp focus the need for all Macquarie Media broadcasters to ensure that the debate they bring to the microphone and the words they use are, at all times, respectful and reflect the standards expected today by our listeners, our clients, and the wider community,\u201d he said. Jones is already on a final warning after Tate took the unprecedented step of scolding him publicly last month. \u201cNotwithstanding his apologies, I have today discussed the matter with Alan and advised him that any recurrence of commentary of this nature will result in the termination of his contract,\u201d Tate said. But the promise never to offend again has not been enough as advertisers have withdrawn their spots not only from Jones\u2019 program, but also from that of his stablemate Ray Hadley and right across the Sydney and Brisbane stations. Sources at Macquarie said an across the board review was unfair because only Jones\u2019 program needed a review. According to monitoring of 2GB by AirCheck, most of the top advertisers on Jones\u2019 program before he made the comments are not advertising now. The letter to advertisers comes at a crucial time for Macquarie, which is subject to an A$113.94m (\u00a363m) offer by Nine Entertainment to acquire the remaining shares in the company. Tate acknowledged the impact of social media activists groups \u2013 such as Mad Fucking Witches and Sleeping Giants \u2013 which had contacted advertisers to remind them about Jones\u2019 history of offensive comments about women. \u201cThrough this incident, we have experienced the ability of offended groups to greatly amplify their complaints and to actively disrupt you, our clients and your staff, who have done no more than seek to engage with the audience which chooses to listen to us,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, we have seen valued commercial partners withdraw from Alan\u2019s program, but the fact is we got it wrong in the first place and we must now do everything possible to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen again. \u201cTo that end, we have already commenced, with Alan\u2019s encouragement and support, a full review of the 2GB/4BC Breakfast Show\u2019s content, presentation and controls with a specific focus on audience and guest/third party engagement.

      "bodyText": "Ita Buttrose has laughed off a suggestion the prime minister told her to install more rightwing voices at the ABC when he handpicked her for the role. Asked by the One Plus One host, Jane Hutcheon, if Scott Morrison had told her \u201cI think we should have more Andrew Bolts or Miranda Devines\u201d at the public broadcaster, Buttrose said no conditions had been placed on her role and she wouldn\u2019t even entertain such a conversation. But she did offer some strong opinions on a certain Murdoch columnist. \u201cI certainly hadn\u2019t thought that Andrew Bolt would be a great fit for the ABC,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he applies for a job we\u2019ll consider him like we do everybody else. But it wouldn\u2019t be up to me to decide. It would be up to the managing director to decide if he would be a good fit for our team. And I\u2019m sure he is quite happy where he is. So there are no job offers out there, Andrew. Sorry, Andrew, but there are no job offers here. No, no, there\u2019s been no discussion about that.\u201d Buttrose also clarified that when she had spoken about the ABC needing to be more diverse she meant culturally diverse. When she was Australian of the year and she visited schools she saw how culturally diverse the playground was and she\u2019d like the ABC to reflect that. After a 60-year media career in which she has worked for Sir Frank and Kerry Packer and Rupert Murdoch, the 77-year-old former magazine and newspaper editor said her favourite media mogul had been Kerry was because he \u201cdidn\u2019t really interfere\u201d and was a lot of fun. \u2018Knock yourselves out\u2019 One mob who would love to see Andrew Bolt have his own show on Aunty is the rightwing lobby group the Institute of Public Affairs. The IPA actively campaigns for the ABC to be privatised and these extreme views are given regular airings on Sky News Australia. The IPA loves to showcase these media appearances by placing the video clip in little TV sets on Twitter. Its director of communications, Evan Mulholland, spoke to Chris Kenny on Sky News this week, arguing it was time for the ABC to be privatised because it was so biased. Unfortunately for Mulholland, most of the responses to his call were negative, with most people saying words to the effect of \u201cleave my ABC alone\u201d. The ABC\u2019s newly retired editorial director Alan Sunderland was a little more pointed, saying: \u201cUnlike, I imagine, 99% of Australia, I actually read the IPA book which advocated the privatisation of the ABC. It was poorly written and argued, devoid of solid research, and largely inconsistent and ideologically driven, imho. But by all means knock yourself out.\u201d Which clips will make the cut?

Reporters Michael Ruffles, James Massola and Michael Evans had been trying to confirm his involvement but, because he had a number of aliases, they couldn\u2019t get the court documents. Then they turned to the old analogue clippings files. \u201cThe Herald asked our librarians for that year\u2019s files about drug crimes, and all deportations in the mid-1990s \u2026 among the six-inch stack of stories was a news brief, just three sentences in the Herald on April 16, 1993, detailing four arrests. It was the eureka moment.\u201d Imagine our dismay when sources said this marvellous resource of yellowing clippings files was not making the move from Fairfax Media\u2019s One Darling Island to Nine Entertainment\u2019s new North Sydney headquarters in 2020. The former Fairfax Media managed to put its photographic archive at risk when it signed a deal for digitisation with Rogers Photo Archive in Little Rock back in 2013.

Weekly, this is Lena Dunham calling you from Wales,\u201d said Lena Dunham, calling from Wales.</p> <p>On the biweekly show, the hosts Lindsey Weber and Bobby Finger decode \u2013 with eager and delightful sass \u2013 the myriad dramas of wannabe celebrities (referred to as \u201cWho?s\u201d) and the tabloids who love them. And, on Tuesday episodes, listeners call the helpline \u2013 sometimes drunk, often stoned, occasionally hysterical \u2013 demanding an explanation of who some Instagram person is, for instance, or why their fake wedding is getting press.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/06/a-bold-new-podcast-takes-on-the-epstein-scandal-podcasts-of-the-week\">A bold new podcast takes on the Epstein scandal \u2013 podcasts of the week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dunham is too much of a real celebrity, or a \u201cThem\u201d, to be discussed on the podcast, but evidently not too famous to call in. She is \u201cobsessed\u201d with Who? Weekly, she told Weber and Finger, and wanted to hear more about the UK reality TV sensation Love Island.</p> <p>\u201cOvernight, these incredible Who?s ... become these total Thems, and then get kicked off the show and transition <em>back </em>to Who?s!\u201d Dunham enthused. She ended the call with a series of podcast in-jokes: \u201cGood form, Bella Thorne! Scar-Jo Yummy Pop! Bye!\u201d</p> <p>In just three years of recording Who? Weekly from their homes, editing it themselves and touring a live show, Weber and Finger now get about 400 calls a week. It\u2019s a strange thing to have your highly specific D-list obsession resonate with so many others. It\u2019s even stranger to have it resonate with Lena Dunham.</p> <p>\u201cShe did a <em>perfect call</em>!\u201d Weber exclaims. \u201cShe did her full name \u2013 \u2018Hi, it\u2019s Lena Dunham\u2019 \u2013 and I\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re <em>crazy</em>, and I <em>love</em> it.\u2019 AND she talked about a topic [Love Island] that is <em>very</em> close to my heart.\u201d</p> <p>Listening to Weber and Finger chat in a Brooklyn cafe is not dissimilar to listening to their podcast, which is best summed up by its tagline: \u201cEverything you need to know about the celebrities you don\u2019t.\u201d Close friends in real life, they talk fast, funny and often both at once, ramping each other up into coffee-spitting laughter or cutting the other down sharp and quick: <em>\u201cBobby, NO. Don\u2019t SAY that!\u201d</em></p> <p>The people they poke at might be influencers, YouTubers, or stars of dud films and reality shows.<strong> </strong>As Weber said in the first episode, \u201cthey\u2019re the people that want to be talked about the most\u201d \u2013 which theoretically gives her and Finger carte blanche to let loose on them.</p> <p>Weber used to write for the pop culture site Vulture and Finger for Jezebel, but earlier this year they were making enough from the podcast\u2019s ads and subscribers to quit full-time jobs and focus on its growth. Perhaps its success can partly be attributed to the hosts\u2019 own insider status, as New York media-types who are only a few degrees of separation from the people they talk about.</p> <p>\u201cI think Lena is one of those celebrities that we would get along with, because she\u2019s also super obsessed with other celebrities,\u201d Weber says. Another is the actor Busy Phillips, who in 2018 appeared as a rare guest on the show, and had no issues sharing what it was like being the least successful former cast member of Freaks and Geeks; and admitted to making more money in a year from sponsored content, or sponcon, than from acting.</p> <p>While Dunham is a \u201cThem\u201d in the show\u2019s parlance, Phillips would be a \u201cWho?\u201d \u2013 and when the Orange Is the New Black star Lea DeLaria called the helpline in August asking to be classified, she was told she was a Who? too.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Who?/Them\u2019 is not actually a value judgment \u2013 it\u2019s literally just a categorisation,\u201d Weber explains. \u201cIt\u2019s totally out of love.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bobbyfinger/status/1167428864466968577\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today\u2019s is one of my favorite Who\u2019s There episodes in a while, and not only because Lea DeLaria called the hotline. <a href=\"https://t.co/k1Atryi95K\">https://t.co/k1Atryi95K</a></p>&mdash; bobby finger (@bobbyfinger) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bobbyfinger/status/1167428864466968577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The podcast deals not just with the antics of Who?s \u2013 the influencer scandals, public apology fails and manufactured beefs \u2013 but the desperate way those antics are covered by the tabloid industry, which is being rendered increasingly irrelevant thanks to social media. When someone can get millions of \u201cfans\u201d just for posting photos of themselves pretending to eat a burger, what even is a celebrity? And why do we need some magazine to tell us what they\u2019re up to a week later?</p> <p>\u201cSo much of [the magazine] Us Weekly now is, like, Instagrams I saw three days ago,\u201d Finger says. \u201cAnd if you\u2019ve already seen the Instagrams, you don\u2019t need to see them again. Maybe you want to hear people talk about them like idiots instead. Sure, we can provide that!\u201d</p> <p>The pair love Who?s including the actor Bella Thorne, who recently (allegedly) <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/07/24/bella-thorne-gave-her-schedule-to-paparazzi-for-more-photo-ops/\">leaked her own schedule</a> to the paparazzi; and Josh Gad, who appears in the coverage of every celebrity death <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%40joshgad%20RIP&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top\">by popping up on social media with an \u201cRIP\u201d</a>.

      "bodyText": "In July this year the niche podcast Who? Weekly got a call from an unexpected listener. \u201cHi Who? Weekly, this is Lena Dunham calling you from Wales,\u201d said Lena Dunham, calling from Wales. On the biweekly show, the hosts Lindsey Weber and Bobby Finger decode \u2013 with eager and delightful sass \u2013 the myriad dramas of wannabe celebrities (referred to as \u201cWho?s\u201d) and the tabloids who love them. And, on Tuesday episodes, listeners call the helpline \u2013 sometimes drunk, often stoned, occasionally hysterical \u2013 demanding an explanation of who some Instagram person is, for instance, or why their fake wedding is getting press. Dunham is too much of a real celebrity, or a \u201cThem\u201d, to be discussed on the podcast, but evidently not too famous to call in. She is \u201cobsessed\u201d with Who? Weekly, she told Weber and Finger, and wanted to hear more about the UK reality TV sensation Love Island. \u201cOvernight, these incredible Who?s ... become these total Thems, and then get kicked off the show and transition back to Who?s!\u201d Dunham enthused. She ended the call with a series of podcast in-jokes: \u201cGood form, Bella Thorne! Scar-Jo Yummy Pop! Bye!\u201d In just three years of recording Who? Weekly from their homes, editing it themselves and touring a live show, Weber and Finger now get about 400 calls a week. It\u2019s a strange thing to have your highly specific D-list obsession resonate with so many others. It\u2019s even stranger to have it resonate with Lena Dunham. \u201cShe did a perfect call!\u201d Weber exclaims. \u201cShe did her full name \u2013 \u2018Hi, it\u2019s Lena Dunham\u2019 \u2013 and I\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re crazy, and I love it.\u2019 AND she talked about a topic [Love Island] that is very close to my heart.\u201d Listening to Weber and Finger chat in a Brooklyn cafe is not dissimilar to listening to their podcast, which is best summed up by its tagline: \u201cEverything you need to know about the celebrities you don\u2019t.\u201d Close friends in real life, they talk fast, funny and often both at once, ramping each other up into coffee-spitting laughter or cutting the other down sharp and quick: \u201cBobby, NO. Don\u2019t SAY that!\u201d The people they poke at might be influencers, YouTubers, or stars of dud films and reality shows. As Weber said in the first episode, \u201cthey\u2019re the people that want to be talked about the most\u201d \u2013 which theoretically gives her and Finger carte blanche to let loose on them. Weber used to write for the pop culture site Vulture and Finger for Jezebel, but earlier this year they were making enough from the podcast\u2019s ads and subscribers to quit full-time jobs and focus on its growth. Perhaps its success can partly be attributed to the hosts\u2019 own insider status, as New York media-types who are only a few degrees of separation from the people they talk about. \u201cI think Lena is one of those celebrities that we would get along with, because she\u2019s also super obsessed with other celebrities,\u201d Weber says. Another is the actor Busy Phillips, who in 2018 appeared as a rare guest on the show, and had no issues sharing what it was like being the least successful former cast member of Freaks and Geeks; and admitted to making more money in a year from sponsored content, or sponcon, than from acting. While Dunham is a \u201cThem\u201d in the show\u2019s parlance, Phillips would be a \u201cWho?\u201d \u2013 and when the Orange Is the New Black star Lea DeLaria called the helpline in August asking to be classified, she was told she was a Who? too. \u201c\u2018Who?/Them\u2019 is not actually a value judgment \u2013 it\u2019s literally just a categorisation,\u201d Weber explains. \u201cIt\u2019s totally out of love.\u201d The podcast deals not just with the antics of Who?s \u2013 the influencer scandals, public apology fails and manufactured beefs \u2013 but the desperate way those antics are covered by the tabloid industry, which is being rendered increasingly irrelevant thanks to social media. When someone can get millions of \u201cfans\u201d just for posting photos of themselves pretending to eat a burger, what even is a celebrity? And why do we need some magazine to tell us what they\u2019re up to a week later? \u201cSo much of [the magazine] Us Weekly now is, like, Instagrams I saw three days ago,\u201d Finger says. \u201cAnd if you\u2019ve already seen the Instagrams, you don\u2019t need to see them again. Maybe you want to hear people talk about them like idiots instead. Sure, we can provide that!\u201d The pair love Who?s including the actor Bella Thorne, who recently (allegedly) leaked her own schedule to the paparazzi; and Josh Gad, who appears in the coverage of every celebrity death by popping up on social media with an \u201cRIP\u201d. (\u201cIt\u2019s a great tic to have,\u201d Weber says, laughing). The US television hosts the Property Brothers provide plenty of fodder (\u201cTwo twins who did magic and now do house renovations? How could we not!\u201d), and Australia\u2019s Hannah Gadsby is a new fave too: \u201cWhen you\u2019re a Who? [Gadsby] and you\u2019re known by a completely different name [Nanette], that\u2019s a recipe for joy,\u201d Finger says. The UK pop star Rita Ora, meanwhile, remains a Who? Weekly MVP, thanks to her ability to attract coverage for doing something as simple as wearing \u2013 or not wearing \u2013 or half-wearing? \u2013 jeans. The podcast has a regular segment called \u201cWhat\u2019s Rita Ora Up To\u201d, where they check in on her headlines each week \u2013 and while she may be transitioning from a Who? to a Them, the hosts say it would be \u201cfucked up\u201d if they stopped following her. \u201cShe\u2019s kind of a magical figure in that she attracts it, appreciates it, likes it, encourages it,\u201d Weber says. Ora has been told about the segment, apparently. She doesn\u2019t care. \u201cHonestly, she\u2019s too busy,\u201d Finger says, shrugging. It\u2019s impossible to talk about Who? Weekly without talking about its Facebook group. With 15,000 members and volunteer moderators, it has become its own world, populated by listeners, yes, but also by industry insiders, who weigh in with their own obsessions, deep dives and rumours. In an article on Refinery29, Amelia Harnish praised the group, whose members refer to themselves as Wholigans, for being \u201ccrucial to the survival of my sanity these past few years\u201d \u2013 and for generating headlines in its own right. The 2017 doxxing of Sean Spicer\u2019s Venmo account, for instance, was instigated by a Wholigan; and it was on Who? Weekly\u2019s Facebook group that a superbly in-depth 29-page PowerPoint presentation first appeared, floating a theory \u2013 with legendary detail \u2013 that Lorde was the reason Dunham and Jack Antonoff split up in 2018. \u201cThere\u2019s no greater way to find people you like than to start your own podcast and let them find you,\u201d Weber says. But while the official group and its innumerable spin-offs are fertile ground for news tips, the pair try to stay out of it. \u201cThe drama makes me nervous,\u201d Finger says. \u201cAnd starting new gossip isn\u2019t what we want to be doing.
