In allowing inclusion of this advert, we believe your charity breached an ethical line, and failed in its duty of care to the people it communicates with, which includes a high proportion of school leavers,\u201d Lewis said in a letter to the Ucas chair, Koen Lamberts.</p> <p>\u201cUcas has privileged, monopoly access to this young and impressionable audience. It is also seen as an institutional authority and therefore adverts contained in your email are effectively being legitimised by inclusion, and some may even mistake it for a direct recommendation.\u201d</p> <p>The emails sent by Ucas carried the introduction: \u201cSee the below information from Future Finance that we hope you find of interest.\u201d A message below from Student Finance read: \u201cStudent finance not enough? Apply for extra funding whenever you need it.\u201d</p> <p>The message told readers: \u201cWe are backing the next generation with smart and simple finance designed around your potential, not your current situation.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis said official student loans offered by the government were \u201can entirely different beast from the commercial debt this email was flogging. Student loans are income-contingent \u2013 only repaid if people earn enough after university and repaid in proportion to that \u2013 and the debt wipes after 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>The commercial loans being offered have interest rates of up to 23.7%, well above the current maximum of 5.4% on student loans and worse than most high street credit cards or even bank overdrafts, according to Lewis.</p> <p>\u201cI would kindly ask that the trustees urgently consider permanently and publicly blocking the inclusion of these adverts, and any adverts from commercial debt firms, in future,\u201d Lewis wrote to Lamberts, who is also the vice-chancellor of the University of Sheffield.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/24/ucas-orders-inquiry-into-racial-profiling-of-uk-students\">Ucas orders inquiry into 'racial profiling' of UK students</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response, Ucas said: \u201cUcas is an independent charity. All our activities are funded by application fees, by universities and colleges, and through gift aid from the profits of our wholly owned commercial subsidiary, Ucas Media. This helps us to keep the costs for students applying to university as low as possible.\u201d</p> <p>It said users could opt out of marketing emails at any time, and said that Ucas \u201calways advises that the best option for students is a government-funded student loan\u201d.</p> <p>Future Finance said it always advised applicants to check they had made full use of the government support available to them before considering taking out a loan. Olga Dolchenko, its chief executive, said it had lent more than \u00a3100m to 15,000 UK university students during the last five years.</p> <p>\u201cGiven undergraduate students often have no credit history or a poor rating, they are unable to access traditional forms of finance and either struggle to make ends meet or choose inappropriate options such as payday lending. We fill this gap, but never encourage students to borrow more than they can afford,\u201d Dolchenko said.</p> <p>The promotion of commercial loans by Ucas was initially criticised on social media after the email was sent at the end of last month.

      "bodyText": "The consumer finance expert Martin Lewis has accused Ucas of abusing its position after the university admissions service allowed a private debt firm to market commercial loans with high interest rates to school leavers. A message from Ucas to students registered with its service carried advertising for Future Finance, a Dublin-based private debt firm that offers loans of up to \u00a340,000 to students at UK universities. Lewis, a former BBC financial journalist who founded the consumer advice website MoneySavingExpert.com, has told Ucas that it had been \u201ctainted\u201d by advertising loans that were inappropriate for most students, charging interests rates far above government-backed loans. \u201cWe have seen a number of concerns raised by shocked recipients. In allowing inclusion of this advert, we believe your charity breached an ethical line, and failed in its duty of care to the people it communicates with, which includes a high proportion of school leavers,\u201d Lewis said in a letter to the Ucas chair, Koen Lamberts. \u201cUcas has privileged, monopoly access to this young and impressionable audience. It is also seen as an institutional authority and therefore adverts contained in your email are effectively being legitimised by inclusion, and some may even mistake it for a direct recommendation.\u201d The emails sent by Ucas carried the introduction: \u201cSee the below information from Future Finance that we hope you find of interest.\u201d A message below from Student Finance read: \u201cStudent finance not enough? Apply for extra funding whenever you need it.\u201d The message told readers: \u201cWe are backing the next generation with smart and simple finance designed around your potential, not your current situation.\u201d Lewis said official student loans offered by the government were \u201can entirely different beast from the commercial debt this email was flogging. Student loans are income-contingent \u2013 only repaid if people earn enough after university and repaid in proportion to that \u2013 and the debt wipes after 30 years.\u201d The commercial loans being offered have interest rates of up to 23.7%, well above the current maximum of 5.4% on student loans and worse than most high street credit cards or even bank overdrafts, according to Lewis. \u201cI would kindly ask that the trustees urgently consider permanently and publicly blocking the inclusion of these adverts, and any adverts from commercial debt firms, in future,\u201d Lewis wrote to Lamberts, who is also the vice-chancellor of the University of Sheffield. In response, Ucas said: \u201cUcas is an independent charity. All our activities are funded by application fees, by universities and colleges, and through gift aid from the profits of our wholly owned commercial subsidiary, Ucas Media. This helps us to keep the costs for students applying to university as low as possible.\u201d It said users could opt out of marketing emails at any time, and said that Ucas \u201calways advises that the best option for students is a government-funded student loan\u201d. Future Finance said it always advised applicants to check they had made full use of the government support available to them before considering taking out a loan. Olga Dolchenko, its chief executive, said it had lent more than \u00a3100m to 15,000 UK university students during the last five years. \u201cGiven undergraduate students often have no credit history or a poor rating, they are unable to access traditional forms of finance and either struggle to make ends meet or choose inappropriate options such as payday lending. We fill this gap, but never encourage students to borrow more than they can afford,\u201d Dolchenko said. The promotion of commercial loans by Ucas was initially criticised on social media after the email was sent at the end of last month. Eva Crossan Jory, the National Union of Students\u2019 vice-president (welfare), said: \u201cOur student loan system may be broken but encouraging students to take out private loans, some of which they will end up paying back double on, is beyond disappointing.\u201d",

He said he had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with either the donation or any straw donor. \u201cI am not the source of the alleged donation,\u201d he wrote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/05/kaila-murnain-didnt-initially-tell-icac-about-meetings-because-she-was-nervous\">Kaila Murnain accused of crying 'fake tears' and 'fabricating a story' at Icac</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI do not know any of the alleged donors of the sum or any of the \u2018straw donors\u2019 as referred to in recent reports, nor have I ever had any contact with them.\u201d</p> <p>In response, Icac chief commissioner, Peter Hall, said the statement would not be considered evidence unless Huang submitted himself to questioning.</p> <p>\u201cThere would need to be compliance by him with the commission\u2019s processes that apply to any witness, which include a preparedness by Mr Huang Xiangmo to submit to any questioning by counsel assisting upon the matters raised by him in his published statement as part of the hearing processes as part of this commission,\u201d Hall said.</p> <p>Huang was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/06/political-donor-huang-xiangmo-blocked-from-returning-to-australia\">denied re-entry into Australia</a> earlier this year amid concerns raised by security agencies. He has been a prolific donor to both major parties and has had long links to Chinese groups in Australia, including the Australian Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China, which is linked to the Chinese Communist party.</p> <p>Sam Dastyari, the federal senator whose career ended over interactions with Huang, has since told the commission that the Chinese billionaire may be an agent of foreign influence.</p> <p>Huang is alleged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/26/nsw-labor-got-100000-in-cash-from-chinese-billionaire-icac-inquiry-told\">have used the $100,000 as payment</a> for seats at Bill Shorten\u2019s table at a March 2015 fundraising dinner in Sydney, hand-delivering the cash to Labor\u2019s headquarters several weeks later.</p> <p>Photos from the dinner show Huang seated next to Shorten, the former NSW Labor leader Luke Foley and the former state MP Ernest Wong.</p> <p>Wong is alleged to have revealed the existence of Huang\u2019s donation to Murnain during a private meeting out the back of state parliament more than a year later, at about 6.45pm on 16 September 2016.</p> <p>Murnain says she talked to Dastyari soon after, who advised her to immediately go and see Labor\u2019s lawyer, Ian Robertson. Murnain alleges Robertson told her to keep quiet about the scandal at a nighttime meeting at his office.</p> <p>Phone records suggest the meeting took place about 7.18pm, leaving at most 33 minutes for Murnain to speak to Dastyari, organise a meeting with Robertson, and get to his office.</p> <p>Robertson\u2019s barrister, Tony McInerney, has called Murnain\u2019s version as a \u201cfabrication\u201d concocted by Murnain to protect herself and explain her failure to act.</p> <p>On Friday, McInerney showed the commission texts and emails showing Murnain was dealing with Robertson on 16 September 2016 about a separate and unrelated issue involving state MP Nick Lalich.</p> <p>He told the commission there was a \u201clikelihood\u201d that Murnain\u2019s meeting with Robertson concerned the Lalich issue, rather than anything to do with Huang\u2019s allegedly unlawful donations.</p> <p>Murnain said she would not have gone to see Robertson about such a routine matter.</p> <p>In his statement, Huang said he had been invited to the dinner as a \u201cleader of the overseas Chinese community\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was frequently invited to a variety of activities, including that fundraising dinner involved in the inquiry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe event organisers invited me not only out of their recognition and respect for me, but also to lend weight to the event so as to further attract attendants.\u201d</p> <p>He suggested \u201creflections\u201d on the political donation system were being used as \u201cammunition in inter- or intra- party fights\u201d. Huang also blamed the media for taking \u201cadvantage of me\u201d, but said it remained his hope and belief that journalists would direct their attention to advocating for donation reform instead.</p> <p>Huang has refused offers to give evidence under oath to Icac via videolink.</p> <p>Internal documents tendered to the commission suggest Shorten\u2019s table at the dinner had been sold for $100,000 and list Huang and his guests as holding the seats. One Labor staffer, Kenrick Cheah, has given evidence that he witnessed Huang attend Labor headquarters several weeks after the dinner to meet with Clements. Clements came out of the office a short time later with a cash-filled Aldi bag.</p> <p>The inquiry continues on Friday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Chinese billionaire and property developer Huang Xiangmo has denied ever giving an illegal donation of $100,000 cash to New South Wales Labor, and attacked the media for \u201csensationalising\u201d the story. It is the first time Huang has spoken about the explosive allegations at the centre of an anti-corruption investigation that have already led to the suspension of the NSW Labor boss Kaila Murnain. Evidence to the state\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption alleges Huang delivered $100,000 cash in an Aldi bag to the then NSW Labor general secretary, Jamie Clements, before a series of straw donors were used to mask the money\u2019s origins. Huang released a statement to the Chinese-language website Sydney Today, denying any knowledge of the cash. He said he had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with either the donation or any straw donor. \u201cI am not the source of the alleged donation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI do not know any of the alleged donors of the sum or any of the \u2018straw donors\u2019 as referred to in recent reports, nor have I ever had any contact with them.\u201d In response, Icac chief commissioner, Peter Hall, said the statement would not be considered evidence unless Huang submitted himself to questioning. \u201cThere would need to be compliance by him with the commission\u2019s processes that apply to any witness, which include a preparedness by Mr Huang Xiangmo to submit to any questioning by counsel assisting upon the matters raised by him in his published statement as part of the hearing processes as part of this commission,\u201d Hall said. Huang was denied re-entry into Australia earlier this year amid concerns raised by security agencies. He has been a prolific donor to both major parties and has had long links to Chinese groups in Australia, including the Australian Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China, which is linked to the Chinese Communist party. Sam Dastyari, the federal senator whose career ended over interactions with Huang, has since told the commission that the Chinese billionaire may be an agent of foreign influence. Huang is alleged to have used the $100,000 as payment for seats at Bill Shorten\u2019s table at a March 2015 fundraising dinner in Sydney, hand-delivering the cash to Labor\u2019s headquarters several weeks later. Photos from the dinner show Huang seated next to Shorten, the former NSW Labor leader Luke Foley and the former state MP Ernest Wong. Wong is alleged to have revealed the existence of Huang\u2019s donation to Murnain during a private meeting out the back of state parliament more than a year later, at about 6.45pm on 16 September 2016. Murnain says she talked to Dastyari soon after, who advised her to immediately go and see Labor\u2019s lawyer, Ian Robertson. Murnain alleges Robertson told her to keep quiet about the scandal at a nighttime meeting at his office. Phone records suggest the meeting took place about 7.18pm, leaving at most 33 minutes for Murnain to speak to Dastyari, organise a meeting with Robertson, and get to his office. Robertson\u2019s barrister, Tony McInerney, has called Murnain\u2019s version as a \u201cfabrication\u201d concocted by Murnain to protect herself and explain her failure to act. On Friday, McInerney showed the commission texts and emails showing Murnain was dealing with Robertson on 16 September 2016 about a separate and unrelated issue involving state MP Nick Lalich. He told the commission there was a \u201clikelihood\u201d that Murnain\u2019s meeting with Robertson concerned the Lalich issue, rather than anything to do with Huang\u2019s allegedly unlawful donations. Murnain said she would not have gone to see Robertson about such a routine matter. In his statement, Huang said he had been invited to the dinner as a \u201cleader of the overseas Chinese community\u201d. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cI was frequently invited to a variety of activities, including that fundraising dinner involved in the inquiry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe event organisers invited me not only out of their recognition and respect for me, but also to lend weight to the event so as to further attract attendants.\u201d He suggested \u201creflections\u201d on the political donation system were being used as \u201cammunition in inter- or intra- party fights\u201d. Huang also blamed the media for taking \u201cadvantage of me\u201d, but said it remained his hope and belief that journalists would direct their attention to advocating for donation reform instead. Huang has refused offers to give evidence under oath to Icac via videolink. Internal documents tendered to the commission suggest Shorten\u2019s table at the dinner had been sold for $100,000 and list Huang and his guests as holding the seats. One Labor staffer, Kenrick Cheah, has given evidence that he witnessed Huang attend Labor headquarters several weeks after the dinner to meet with Clements. Clements came out of the office a short time later with a cash-filled Aldi bag. The inquiry continues on Friday.",

He said nations including Britain, France, Germany and the United States \u201chave been highlighting that this is not acceptable behaviour in the international community because they are all worried about China engaging in the same kinds of pressure tactics with them\u201d. Canada\u2019s relations with China soured after its arrest of Chinese Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a US warrant last December. Nine days later, Beijing detained two Canadians \u2013 former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor \u2013 and accused them of espionage in a move widely viewed as retaliation. They are among a string of foreign nationals arrested in China and charged with espionage or attempting to steal state secrets. Trudeau added that \u201cwe need to figure out how to engage with them, but we also have to be clear-eyed about it, that China plays by a very different set of rules and principles than we do in the west\u201d. His comments may further inflame tensions between the two countries, which had appeared to be trying to move on from the row. This week both Beijing and Ottawa nominated new ambassadors, although a spokesman for the Chinese foreign minstry this week urged Canada to \u201creflect on its mistakes\u201d and immediately release Meng. \u201cAt present, China-Canada relations are facing serious difficulties,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily briefing. Geng said China hopes the new Canadian envoy Dominic Barton can play an active role in returning ties to a \u201cnormal track\u201d. The previous Canadian ambassador, John McCallum, was fired in January after he said it would be \u201cgreat\u201d if the US dropped its extradition request for the Huawei executive.

I have had the opportunity to come back.\u201d Oxlade-Chamberlain admits he used to have his career all mapped out in stages. \u201cBy 24 I wanted to have won the Champions League and be scoring 10-15 goals a season,\u201d he says. \u201cBut sometimes things just don\u2019t go the way you want them to.\u201d That is not said with any trace of self-pity. Back in the Liverpool frame, with a new contract until 2023, and back on the England scene with a young, exciting squad, this feels a fresh start rather than a time to dwell on the past. \u201cI\u2019ll worry about that when I\u2019m 50 and I\u2019ve got a big belly like my dad,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cThen I\u2019ll think; \u2018What if? I could have done that.\u2019 It hasn\u2019t all been roses but one thing I would say and why I remain proud of myself is that even when things haven\u2019t gone as I wanted them to I still make sure I come back with the same optimism to improve and to do more. \u201cI would say I have enjoyed every minute of my career up until this point because it has shaped me to be who I am both on and off the pitch. By no means I am sat here looking back at what could have been. For now I\u2019m just looking forward.\u201d",

Juventus winger Bernardeschi tested Hayrapetyan from 10 yards, before Karapetian and Marco Verratti were each shown a yellow card following a petulant clash near the halfway line. </p> <p>Italy have not lost an away European Championships qualifier since September 2006 and were level after 28 minutes as Armenia switched off defensively. </p> <p>Chelsea defender Emerson Palmieri easily tricked his way past Barseghyan on the left before delivering a pinpoint cross for the unmarked Belotti to volley home at the back post. </p> <p>Italy almost turned the game on its head a minute later when Bernardeschi clipped the top of the crossbar with a curling effort. </p> <p>Karapetian\u2019s needless earlier booking then proved costly a minute into first-half added-time when he was shown a second yellow by German referee Daniel Siebert after appearing to catch Leonardo Bonucci in the face with an outstretched arm. </p> <p>Torino striker Belotti, who after his equaliser correctly had a goal ruled out for offside and then scuffed wide, continued to be in the thick of the action and squandered a golden chance to put his side ahead going into the break when he was superbly teed up by Federico Chiesa. </p> <p>Despite their numerical advantage, the four-time world champions struggled to create in the second period and had to be wary of conceding a breakaway goal. </p> <p>Armenia captain Henrikh Mkhitaryan, up against the country he now plays in following his loan switch from Arsenal to Roma, threatened when he forced a last-gasp block from Palmieri. </p> <p>Italy eventually went in front 13 minutes from time. Stand-in skipper Bonucci swung a hopeful ball into the box and substitute Pellegrini rose to head his first international goal into the bottom left corner. </p> <p>The unconvincing visitors had done little to warrant the lead but quickly put the result beyond doubt with a fortuitous third three minutes later. </p> <p>Belotti twisted in the box before his low shot rebounded of the right post and hit keeper Hayrapetyan before trickling over the line. </p> <p>The 25-year-old forward should have had more to celebrate in stoppage time but he was harshly denied by an incorrect offside flag after poking home from close range. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d71512f8f083106f4556285\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T18:18:30.655Z\">7.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here is the Northern Ireland team</strong> to play Luxembourg.

The Danes are second, five points behind Ireland with a game in hand. <br></em>Republic of Ireland v Switzerland<br><em>Ireland have parlayed five goals in four matches into three wins and a draw, meaning that another victory would leave them in a very handsome position with three games to play.</em></p> <p><strong>Group F<br></strong>Faroe Islands v Sweden<br><em>75% of all goals scored by Sweden against the Faroe Islands in their entire history have been scored by Zlatan Ibrahimovic (that\u2019s three goals). Sweden need a win to hang on to Spain\u2019s coat-tails; they are currently level with Romania, five points back.<br></em>Norway v Malta<br><em>In 10 previous games Norway have scored 26 goals and conceded just a paltry three, though they have failed to win two of them. Currently fourth in the group, victory is imperative here.<br></em>Romania v Spain<br><em>Spain have played four and won four, but have never in their entire history won in Romania (in six attempts). </em></p> <p><strong>Group G<br></strong>Israel v North Macedonia<br><em>Other than the rampant Poles and the useless Latvians Group G is pretty close, so much so that Macedonia, in fifth, would go second if they win this game by more than a single goal.</em></p> <p>Plus some international friendlies:<br>Saudi Arabia v Mali (6pm)<br>Montenegro v Hungary<br>Northern Ireland v Luxembourg</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And with that, I shall take my leave. It\u2019s been a goal-blessed evening, especially for Scandinavians. Thanks for being here. Here are tomorrow\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifying fixtures (7.45pm BST kick-offs unless stated). Bye! Group C Estonia v Belarus (5pm) Germany v Netherlands Group E Slovakia v Croatia Wales v Azerbaijan Group G Austria v Latvia Slovenia v Poland Group I Cyprus v Kazakhstan (5pm) San Marino v Belgium Scotland v Russia This is Reuters on Spain\u2019s win over Romania: Spain made it five wins out of five in their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign by earning a scrappy 2-1 victory in Romania on Thursday despite playing the final stages with 10 men after defender Diego Llorente was sent off. Captain Sergio Ramos gave Spain a deserved lead in the 27th minute by converting a penalty to score a fourth goal in five European qualifiers, his third from the spot. Paco Alcacer put Spain further at ease by scoring early in the second half after missing three clear chances in the first, but substitute Florin Andone brought Romania back into contention with a close-range strike in the 59th minute. The goal galvanised the vociferous home crowd and they grew more determined after Llorente was shown a straight red card with 11 minutes left for denying a clear scoring opportunity with a foul. Spain were let off the hook when George Puscas blazed over the bar in stoppage-time after an outstanding save from goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and they clung on to earn a first win away to Romania at the seventh attempt. Moreno\u2019s side top Group F with 15 points from five games, Sweden are second with 10 after thrashing the Faroe Islands 4-0 away from home, while Norway are third on eight after beating Malta 2-0. Romania slipped down to fourth place on seven. And this is Sergio Ramos\u2019s response to his side\u2019s victory: While this is what PA Media has got to say about Northern Ireland\u2019s victory: A horror own goal from Kevin Malget was enough to give an experimental Northern Ireland side a 1-0 victory over Luxembourg in their Windsor Park friendly. Malget inexplicably headed into his own net eight minutes before half-time to settle a match short on quality as both sides looked to more important challenges to come on Monday. For Northern Ireland, that is a Euro 2020 qualifier against Germany, a match which loomed large in Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s thinking as he sprung a few surprises in a youthful starting line-up. Cardiff defender Ciaron Brown - uncapped at any level and only called into Ian Baraclough\u2019s under-21s squad last week - started and looked assured as O\u2019Neill made eight changes to the side that beat Belarus in June. Corry Evans, captain for the night, survived, along with goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell and Josh Magennis, but the likes of Jonny Evans, Craig Cathcart and Conor Washington did not even make the matchday squad. Instead, the uncapped Bobby Burns, Alfie McCalmont and Ethan Galbraith took their places among the substitutes. Kyle Lafferty, who only flew in to Belfast on Wednesday evening after his late call-up, was thrown straight into the starting XI and looked strong despite having only started one match for his new Norwegian club Sarpsborg and seeing his debut ended by a red card 69 minutes in. Unsurprisingly it took Northern Ireland some time to bed in as Luxembourg, preparing for their own European qualifier against Serbia, kept them pegged back early on. A Jordan Thompson free-kick caused chaos after quarter of an hour when goalkeeper Anthony Moris came way off his line but missed the ball, but Magennis was crowded out as Brown tried to find him with a header. Better chances began to appear for Northern Ireland after the half-hour mark, although Gavin Whyte sent the best of them well over the crossbar from an angle. O\u2019Neill\u2019s side would not manage a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes, but they would take the lead before the break thanks to Malget\u2019s own goal. George Saville headed the ball back into the mix after Luxembourg failed to deal with a corner. Though goalkeeper Moris beat Tom Flanagan to the ball, it span up before Malget inexplicably headed into his own goal. Luxembourg were again stronger to start the second half, with Vincent Thill and Leandro Martins getting the first shots on target of the night, but neither tested Peacock-Farrell. O\u2019Neill responded by sending on Shayne Lavery for his second cap and McCalmont for his debut. Lavery, just a couple of weeks after scoring a superb goal on this ground for Linfield in their Europa League qualifier against Qarabag, was quick to impress. He raced down the right before brushing the side-netting with a shot from a tight angle before his low cross from the left deserved a better finish than Thompson\u2019s rising effort. Liam Donnelly - who has scored eight goals in eight for Motherwell to start the season - then came on for his second cap and almost got his first international goal soon after. Luxembourg\u2019s substitute goalkeeper Ralph Schon collided with his own defender and spilt the ball before making a smart save to deny Donnelly on the follow-up. Galbraith came on to make his debut with three minutes remaining as Steven Davis also enjoyed a late cameo to equal Aaron Hughes\u2019 tally of 112 caps on the night the former defender had been honoured at half-time. They had little time to make an impact but Northern Ireland had already done enough to extend their winning run to five games before facing the mighty Germany next week. Paul Doyle has filed his report from the Aviva Stadium, and here it is: It may have come in his 11th cap but David McGoldrick can say his first international goal was well timed, as it earned a point that sustains Irish belief in qualification for Euro 2020. That ambition looked far-fetched after Fabian Sch\u00e4r shot Switzerland into the lead, but Ireland, second best for much of the game, rallied to earn a draw. Much more here: Northern Ireland completed their friendly win over Luxembourg, though it was both a bit closer, and a bit more reliant on totally freak own-goals, than they would probably have liked. Thanks ever so much for your matchreporterly efforts, Fred. Final scores! It\u2019s all over, everywhere, and this is how it all ended: Group D Gibraltar 0-6 Denmark Republic of Ireland 1-1 Switzerland Group F Faroe Islands 0-4 Sweden Norway 2-0 Mata Romania 1-2 Spain Group G Israel 1-1 North Macedonia Group J Armenia 1-3 Italy Bosnia-Herzegovina 5-0 Liechtenstein Finland 1-0 Greece What a save! Kepa somehow keeps out Puskas\u2019s header with his feet as Romania chase an equaliser, and then the rebound is blazed over the bar! Into stoppage time in Dublin, and there\u2019ll be five minutes of it. The Republic will be very happy with their point, if they can only cling on to it. GOALS! Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina 5-0 Liechtenstein! Goals in the 85th, 88th and 89th minute make the game safe, and then a bit safer, and then Fort Knox solid for Bosnia! Edin Dzeko got the first of them to open the floodgates. GOAL! Republic of Ireland 1-1 Switzerland! Glenn Whelan hits the bar with an absolutely thunderous drive, but with the woodwork still reverberating McClean crosses from the left and David McGoldrick scores with a quite brilliant header! Red card! Spain go down to 10 men! Diego Llorente is sent off after bringing down Puscas just outside the penalty area. I think he might have got some of the ball there, but it was certainly close, and he definitely got some of the player. GOAL! Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina 2-0 Liechtenstein! This has gone down as an Andreas Malin own goal, after a shot from outside the area deflected one way off one defender, and the other way off another, to leave the Liechtenstein goalkeeper flat-footed. Really if the first deflection had wrong-footed him the second should have right-footed him again, but that wasn\u2019t how it worked out. GOAL! Gibraltar 0-6 Denmark! Another for Gytkjaer, who finishes coolly at the end of a good move. GOAL! Gibraltar 0-5 Denmark! The Danes have scored twice in four minutes, with Thomas Delaney and Christian Gytkjaer on the scoresheet, and Gibraltar very much on the rocks. GOAL! Republic of Ireland 0-1 Switzerland! Fabian Schar sweeps the Swiss into the lead! A lovely finish from the centre-back. Clinton Morrison, who is watching the game on Sky Sports News, announces that Denmark have scored, having clearly not been paying Ireland\u2019s opponents a great deal of attention. \u201cConsidering how much Sergio Ramos has gotten away with throughout his career I\u2019m never going to feel bad about anything he gets booked for,\u201d says JR. \u201cEven if they gave him a yellow card before the start of every game for the rest of his career just for being Sergio Ramos I don\u2019t think things would ever be even.\u201d GOAL! Israel 1-1 North Macedonia! An equaliser for Macedonia! Israel\u2019s lead lasts just nine minutes, until Arijan Ardemi heads in for the visitors! A couple of updates from Bucharest: GOAL! Romania 1-2 Spain! Andone pulls one back for Romania! It\u2019s a bad cross from the left, which is sent back in from the right only slightly more accurately, headed back across by the guy who did the initial bad cross, and turned in! GOAL! Israel 1-0 North Macedonia! A wildly and unsettlingly aggressively celebrated goal in Israel, where Eran Zahavi sticks out a left foot to turn in a low centre from the right! Our man in Romania (or watching TV footage being beamed from Romania) is impressed: GOAL! Finland 1-0 Greece! Yet another penalty! Pukki passes the ball to his right, with the goalkeeper helpfully flinging himself the other way. GOAL! Gibraltar 0-3 Denmark! Christian Eriksen scores his second goal of the night from the penalty spot. The penalty decision was the very height of ludicrousness, but Eriksen has not mercy and thunders his spot kick straight down the middle into the roof of the net! GOAL! Romania 0-2 Spain! Paco Alcacer has doubled Spain\u2019s lead in Romania, tapping in Rodrigo\u2019s centre. Not the hardest finish he\u2019ll ever have. Sergio Ramos was booked for his goal celebration. He didn\u2019t remove his shirt, or leap into Spain\u2019s eight fans \u2013 he was cautioned for this: GOAL! Norway 2-0 Malta! Josh King has doubled Norway\u2019s advantage in first-half stoppage time. It\u2019s yet another penalty, though the Bournemouth forward bucks the continental trend by shooting to his left. The goalkeeper goes the right way, but can\u2019t reach the shot! Someone who\u2019s actually been able to focus on the game is rather less impressed by the Republic\u2019s display: Here\u2019s the own goal that has given Northern Ireland a half-time lead over Luxembourg. Nice header. It\u2019s half-time in Dublin. Switzerland have had more possession but the Republic of Ireland have looked very threatening on the break, without quite making the most of their opportunities. It\u2019s goalless at the break. More now from our temporary voluntary Romania correspondent. Spain have had seven shots on target so far, and Romania none (though the hosts are 4-2 up on the less impressive shots-off-target metric): GOAL! Faroe Islands 0-4 Sweden! Robin Quaison stretches Sweden\u2019s lead. The Swedes host Norway on Sunday, an absolutely massive game in Group F and likely to be a little more competitive. GOAL! Northern Ireland 1-0 Luxembourg! Luxembourg have popped one in their own onion bag! GOAL! Gibraltar 0-2 Denmark! Another penalty, not entirely dissimilar to the one Ramos scored a few moments ago. Again the keeper goes to his right, again the ball goes to his left, but Eriksen\u2019s effort was a little less nonchalant and a bit more emphatic. It looked to me like the defender planted a foot on Ceballos\u2019 own foot, and it was thus a penalty. But the Spaniard\u2019s dive was certainly quite enthusiastic. GOAL! Romania 0-1 Spain Sergio Ramos coolly sends the keeper the wrong way before slotting his spot kick to his right! Penalty to Spain! Ceballos is upended in the area and the Spanish will have the chance to break the deadlock in Romania. A chance for Switzerland! A long throw from the right is headed to the edge of the area, where Rodriguez runs onto it, completely unchallenged, but he shanks his left-foot volley and the ball bounces well wide. Nice finish, that from Lindelof, who flashes in a low half-volley at the far post after a corner. GOAL! Faroe Islands 0-3 Sweden Methinks the Swedes might win this one. Victor Lindelof has put them three up in the 23rd minute. The Republic of Ireland have had a fabulous chance to take the lead against Switzerland, James McClean running into the area after good work by Jeff Hendrick, but Mbabu did excellently to track his run infield from the left and blocked his effort. GOAL! Faroe Islands 0-2 Sweden Alexander Isak has a two-minute brace! The first on 12 minutes was a decent near-post header, the second a right-footed finish after a defensive howler, as a centre-back passed straight to a yellow shirt. GOAL! Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina 1-0 Liechtenstein! Amer Gojak has scored with Bosnia\u2019s first shot against Liechtenstein. A goal! Denmark take a sixth-minute lead in Gibraltar, where Robert Skov has scored his first international goal, a fairly straightforward header from Eriksen\u2019s excellent cross. While we wait for goals in today\u2019s European qualifiers, here are some goals (and a terrible, terrible miss) from an African World Cup one played a little earlier: Our games have started! No goals yet, but the Republic of Ireland have a first-minute corner. Romania has not exactly been overwhelmed by the Spanish hordes: Roberto Mancini has come up with some entirely convincing reasons for Italy\u2019s unconvincing performance against Armenia: Their sending-off made it difficult for us as they closed up their defence. Today it was difficult to play: our players have two league games under their belts, Armenia are in mid-season. It\u2019s not an excuse, it\u2019s the truth. \u201cCredit to Paco Alc\u00e1cer, who\u2019s gone from fish-out-of-water flop at Barcelona (though hardly the only one in recent history) to headline unstoppable goal-machine at Borussia Dortmund,\u201d writes Charles Antaki. \u201cThe national team have needed a plausible striker even since Fernando Torres sank slowly in the west, and maybe Alc\u00e1cer will have a better go at than the likes of Llorente, Rodrigo, at al. Or they could always try and tempt David Villa out of retirement.\u201d In Spain\u2019s recent history they have have lacked plausible strikers more often than they have genuinely needed them, but I take your point. Here\u2019s the PA Media report on Italy\u2019s win over Armenia: Italy scored twice in the final 15 minutes to beat 10-man Armenia 3-1 and maintain their 100% record in Euro 2020 qualifying. Roberto Mancini\u2019s side came from behind to make it five wins from as many games at the top of Group J thanks to Andrea Belotti, Lorenzo Pellegrini and an own goal from Armenia goalkeeper Aram Hayrapetyan. Alexander Karapetian claimed a surprise 11th-minute opener in Yerevan but the home side\u2019s hopes of an upset were dealt a blow when the striker was sent off in first-half stoppage time. Italy also struck the woodwork through Federico Bernardeschi immediately after equalising, while Belotti had two goals disallowed for offside, one incorrectly. The visitors, without injured captain Giorgio Chiellini, started slowly and fell behind after sloppily conceding possession deep in Armenia\u2019s half. Tigran Barseghyan led the hosts\u2019 counter-attack, driving forward before slipping the ball to Karapetian to clinically find the net via the left post and claim his fifth goal in his last seven international appearances. The setback seemed to spark life into Mancini\u2019s men. Juventus winger Bernardeschi tested Hayrapetyan from 10 yards, before Karapetian and Marco Verratti were each shown a yellow card following a petulant clash near the halfway line. Italy have not lost an away European Championships qualifier since September 2006 and were level after 28 minutes as Armenia switched off defensively. Chelsea defender Emerson Palmieri easily tricked his way past Barseghyan on the left before delivering a pinpoint cross for the unmarked Belotti to volley home at the back post. Italy almost turned the game on its head a minute later when Bernardeschi clipped the top of the crossbar with a curling effort. Karapetian\u2019s needless earlier booking then proved costly a minute into first-half added-time when he was shown a second yellow by German referee Daniel Siebert after appearing to catch Leonardo Bonucci in the face with an outstretched arm. Torino striker Belotti, who after his equaliser correctly had a goal ruled out for offside and then scuffed wide, continued to be in the thick of the action and squandered a golden chance to put his side ahead going into the break when he was superbly teed up by Federico Chiesa. Despite their numerical advantage, the four-time world champions struggled to create in the second period and had to be wary of conceding a breakaway goal. Armenia captain Henrikh Mkhitaryan, up against the country he now plays in following his loan switch from Arsenal to Roma, threatened when he forced a last-gasp block from Palmieri. Italy eventually went in front 13 minutes from time. Stand-in skipper Bonucci swung a hopeful ball into the box and substitute Pellegrini rose to head his first international goal into the bottom left corner. The unconvincing visitors had done little to warrant the lead but quickly put the result beyond doubt with a fortuitous third three minutes later. Belotti twisted in the box before his low shot rebounded of the right post and hit keeper Hayrapetyan before trickling over the line. The 25-year-old forward should have had more to celebrate in stoppage time but he was harshly denied by an incorrect offside flag after poking home from close range. Here is the Northern Ireland team to play Luxembourg. And the Luxembourg team to play Northern Ireland: Northern Ireland: Peacock-Farrell, McLaughlin, Flanagan, Brown, Ferguson, Corry Evans, Thompson, Saville, Whyte, Magennis, Lafferty.

Subs: Schon, Skenderovic, Hall, Selimovic, Philipps, Martins Pereira, Da Mota Alves, Bohnert, Olesen, Turpel, Joachim, Kips. Referee: Bryn Markham-Jones (Wales). This statistic is impressive. I am impressed. In the Republic of Ireland\u2019s group, Christian Eriksen captains Denmark in Gibraltar: Gibraltar: Coleing, Sergeant, Roy Chipolina, Joseph Chipolina, Olivero, Britto, Annesley, Walker, Andrew Hernandez, De Barr.

Subs: Andersen, Jorgensen, Braithwaite, Lerager, Dalsgaard, Billing, Hansen, Dolberg, Knudsen, Christiansen, Iversen. Italy have indeed won 3-1, though it could have been better: they had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside in the last minute. Meanwhile in Romania, the following teams have been announced for the host nation\u2019s first meeting with Spain since Euro 1996: Romania: Tatarusanu, Benzar, Nedelcearu, Chiriches, Grigore, Tosca, Deac, Marin, Stanciu, Puscas, Keseru.

Subs: De Gea, Nunez, Hermoso, Parejo, Gaya, Pau Lopez, Thiago, Carvajal, Oyarzabal, Suso, Sarabia, Rodri. In the early game Armenia took the lead against Italy in the 11th minute and enjoyed the advantage for nearly 20 minutes, but they are now 3-1 and a man down, with the game entering stoppage time. We have some team news! Here are the Republic of Ireland v Switzerland line-ups, by way of a start: Rep of Ireland: Randolph, Coleman, Duffy, Keogh, Stevens, Hendrick, Whelan, Hourihane, McClean, McGoldrick, Robinson.

It\u2019s, well, probably not the very best line-up of matches an international break is ever going to serve up, but that shouldn\u2019t stop us having some fun. Straight to it, then, with a list of tonight\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers (all 7.45pm BST kick-offs, unless stated): Group J Armenia v Italy (5pm) Bosnia-Herzegovina v Liechtenstein Bosnia embarrassingly drew their first ever game against Liechtenstein, but since then have won five on the spin, and with the away side having lost all four of their games so far by an aggregate score of 0-13, they should make that half a dozen tonight. Finland v Greece The two nations with the blue-and-whitest flags in Europe go head to head in Tampere, where Finland have won their last five games without so much as letting a goal in. Group D Gibraltar v Denmark If Gibraltar, marooned as they are on 0 points and with 0 goals after three games, don\u2019t lose this one as well then Denmark might as well give up, even if in their only home game so far Gibraltar lost narrowly, 1-0 to Ireland. The Danes are second, five points behind Ireland with a game in hand. Republic of Ireland v Switzerland Ireland have parlayed five goals in four matches into three wins and a draw, meaning that another victory would leave them in a very handsome position with three games to play. Group F Faroe Islands v Sweden 75% of all goals scored by Sweden against the Faroe Islands in their entire history have been scored by Zlatan Ibrahimovic (that\u2019s three goals). Sweden need a win to hang on to Spain\u2019s coat-tails; they are currently level with Romania, five points back. Norway v Malta In 10 previous games Norway have scored 26 goals and conceded just a paltry three, though they have failed to win two of them. Currently fourth in the group, victory is imperative here. Romania v Spain Spain have played four and won four, but have never in their entire history won in Romania (in six attempts). Group G Israel v North Macedonia Other than the rampant Poles and the useless Latvians Group G is pretty close, so much so that Macedonia, in fifth, would go second if they win this game by more than a single goal. Plus some international friendlies: Saudi Arabia v Mali (6pm) Montenegro v Hungary Northern Ireland v Luxembourg",

My assistant Tammy was on the roof of her house for 30 hours hanging on to a coconut tree with her 8-year-old daughter Ariana. Her grandmother lost her grip and slipped off the roof and drowned. There was no way of getting to them. They\u2019ve lost everything.\u201d</p> <p>St George said the storm surge came from the north side, where the airport and the humane society animal shelter are, causing a lot of animals to drown. </p> <p>\u201cThe jet ski operators are the real heroes,\u201d St George said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give up all day long, just going back and forth. Our port authority team got on jet skis and rescued more than 100 people from the flooded areas. The jet skis came into their own because you couldn\u2019t get a boat there and you couldn\u2019t drive. So they turned out to be incredibly useful rescue vehicle because they can go over quite shallow water. But eventually fuel becomes a problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough getting back to Grand Bahama because the airspace is still closed and there\u2019s a lot of \u2018hurricane tourism\u2019 \u2013 people flying over the island to take a look,\u201d she said. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d716f568f08143ee1ae0f08\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-05T20:42:14.791Z\">9.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump (again) claims he was right about forecast in Alabama.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re wrapping up the Hurricane Dorian live blog, but our reporters in the Bahamas and Delaware, where the storm is headed, will be filing updates to the site through the evening and tomorrow. Here\u2019s where things stand: Dorian\u2019s eye has been slightly off the coast of the Carolinas all day, causing dangerously high winds, flooding and tornadoes. NGOs providing care to the hard hit Abaco Islands in the Bahamas described devastating scenes of hundreds, if not thousands of people, waiting to get basic necessities and medical care. Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados is part of the delegation and took a minute to talk to the Guardian about her thoughts on hurricane Dorian\u2019s links to the climate crisis. She did not pull her punches. \u201cWe are on the front line of the consequences of climate change but we don\u2019t cause it,\u201d she said. And the president has again claimed he was right to say Alabama was under threat from Dorian. His evidence doesn\u2019t support him. Sarah St George, chairman of the Grand Bahama Port Authority, told the Guardian that the \u201cforce and size\u201d of Dorian took everyone by surprise, a situation made worse by the hurricane stalling over the archipelago. \u201cGrand Bahama is not in good shape at all because 70% of it was under water,\u201d St George said. \u201cOn the north side of the island the water was coming up to the second floor of their houses. My assistant Tammy was on the roof of her house for 30 hours hanging on to a coconut tree with her 8-year-old daughter Ariana. Her grandmother lost her grip and slipped off the roof and drowned. There was no way of getting to them. They\u2019ve lost everything.\u201d St George said the storm surge came from the north side, where the airport and the humane society animal shelter are, causing a lot of animals to drown. \u201cThe jet ski operators are the real heroes,\u201d St George said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give up all day long, just going back and forth. Our port authority team got on jet skis and rescued more than 100 people from the flooded areas. The jet skis came into their own because you couldn\u2019t get a boat there and you couldn\u2019t drive. So they turned out to be incredibly useful rescue vehicle because they can go over quite shallow water. But eventually fuel becomes a problem.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s tough getting back to Grand Bahama because the airspace is still closed and there\u2019s a lot of \u2018hurricane tourism\u2019 \u2013 people flying over the island to take a look,\u201d she said. In the president\u2019s continuing battle against his own incorrect statement that Alabama was under threat from Hurricane Dorian, which has left at least 23 people dead, he has just now been tweeting what he claims is evidence he knew what he was talking about. It is not. The first set of maps, from last Thursday, show a 5% chance Alabama could be hit by 39mph winds. He said on Wednesday, as in yesterday, that there was a 95% chance Alabama was going to get hit. His second point is an Alabama National Guard tweet \u2013 also from last week \u2013 with the agency saying it is ready for Dorian. The Alabama National Guard tweeted this on Monday: According to the AP: \u201cthe National Hurricane Center has issued 45 advisories giving probabilities for tropical storm and hurricane force winds for dozens of cities. Alabama locations have not been in any of those wind probability advisories, although Massachusetts and Canadian locales have been listed.\u201d Before Miami was even a city, Bahamians had settled there and built infrastructure. But Miami\u2019s search-and-rescue team, one of the best in the nation, has been blocked by federal law from traveling to the archipelago to help. So Miami city leaders have taken things into their own hands, reports the Miami Herald: In a press conference Thursday morning, Miami\u2019s mayor said that rather than waiting for federal approval to send the Urban Search and Rescue team from Miami, the city is working out an agreement directly with the Bahamian government to send firefighters who are part of the federal team. But the search-and-rescue specialists will go strictly in their role as Miami firefighters. \u201cIn the first few days, this is when it\u2019s the most critical,\u201d Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said in Thursday\u2019s press conference outside Miami City Hall. \u201cWe just felt a moral obligation, frankly, to do everything we can do ... Lives are at stake.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland is in Nassau, where he spoke to Luiz David Rodriguez, programme manager for the NGO Direct Relief, via satellite phone. Rodriguez is currently out on Abaco Islands where he\u2019s observing some disturbing scenes outside the island\u2019s main health clinic near Marsh Harbour. He says the clinic has the capacity to deal with about 20 people but he estimates there are between 1,500 - 2000 people waiting in the area around the clinic. He says: \u201clots of people are just laying around, waiting to get off the island\u201d. \u201cPeople are getting a little desperate.\u201d He said it was too early to properly assess what the most pressing health concerns but suggested many people are simply exhausted. Aid groups have been struggling to deliver basic supplies to the Abacos due to the level of destruction, but some planes are now landing in the area. \u201cEverything is destroyed,\u201d he said, but added that much of the flooding in the area is present in has begun to subside. Hurricane Dorian hits the Carolinas The Bahamas Nassau-based newspaper, the Tribune, has had to report on the devastating events on the island while wondering about the safety of family and colleagues who are difficult to contact because of power outages and disruptions to telecommunications. They have a story this morning about a police sergeant, Dominique McKenzie, who saved six people and his family from a flooding apartment building on Monday: \u201cI looked at the church but I decided that was not the best place. Then I looked to my left and saw an abandoned two-storey building and decided that we will make a break for that building,\u201d he said. He took his wife and two children over first, entered the abandoned building, then went back for the others, including the disabled tenant. He said they put the woman in a refrigerator, using it as a makeshift flotation device, and guided her over in about six to seven feet of water. \u201cIt was an old refrigerator I had planned to move before the storm, and thank God we did not move (it),\u201d he said. \u201cWe used the refrigerator as a boat and we were able to put her inside it, me and my wife and her brothers and we rescued ourselves and six others, pretty much.\u201d He said other neighbours also sought shelter in the abandoned building. They told him there was another woman who was trapped in her home who needed help. I\u2019m at the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Nassau where a delegation of Caribbean leaders just departed for a fly over trip to see the destruction on Abaco Islands. Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados is part of the delegation and took a minute to talk to the Guardian about her thoughts on hurricane Dorian\u2019s links to the climate crisis. She did not pull her punches. \u201cWe are on the front line of the consequences of climate change but we don\u2019t cause it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the vulnerability that attaches therefore to us is a matter we\u2019re trying to get the international community to deal with consistently.\u201d She added: People say the words and hear you, but they don\u2019t follow through so that I have every confidence. Now that the last few years are beginning to show others that frontline states, whether it\u2019s an islands in the Caribbean or states in the US or cities, all of us who are continuously being affected, have to recognise that this doesn\u2019t happen out of the blue. \u201cThe warmer waters do what? They fuel the growth and the strength of hurricanes.\u201d There were more than 253,700 power outages in South Carolina as of 1pm ET, according to PowerOutage.Us. There were 4,174 power outages documented in North Carolina and 6,976 in Georgia at the time. The Carolinas are facing dangerously high-winds, flash flooding and tornadoes as Dorian\u2019s eye drifts off the coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) deploys specialized aircraft during hurricanes, sending experts straight into the eye of the hurricane. One of those experts, Nick Underwood, shared a video online of his trip into the eye of Dorian this morning: How does he do that? With this plane: Dorian\u2019s maximum sustained winds have dropped slightly to 110 mph (175 kmh), making it once again a Category 2 hurricane, according to the Associated Press: That\u2019s still strong enough to cause damage along the coast of the Carolinas, where the storm is now close enough for hurricane-force winds to hit land. Forecasters say Dorian\u2019s center at 11 am EDT was about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, still moving north off the coast at about 8 mph (13 kmh). Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 kilometers) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 kilometers). The National Hurricane Center says large and destructive waves up to 8 feet high could be seen in Myrtle Beach if peak surge happens during high tide. As the eye of Hurricane Dorian heads along the coast of North Carolina, a group of majestic horses will not be evacuated. This is because these colonial Spanish mustangs have honed their skills for hurricane protection and will huddle together when the storm hits North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks The Corolla Wild Horse Fund, which manages the horses, said the herd had survived 500 years of storms by taking to higher ground and huddling together: \u201cbutts to the wind.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland has been speaking with people at a rescue center in Nassau, the Bahamas. This includes people who have been transported there from Great Abaco Island, one of the places most devastated by the hurricane. Kathlyn Russell, a housekeeper from Great Abaco Island, had stayed inside her home when Hurricane Dorian hit. But after hours inside, her downstairs flooded, the roof flew off and she was left with no other option but to run. She left her home, clutching her six year-old grandson Chrishon with both arms close to her chest. \u201cAs I was running the wind was picking me up and licking me down,\u201d she told the Guardian. Somehow she made it across the street to a neighbour\u2019s home, still standing. \u201cI lifted my hands up and I said: Lord, help me.\u201d Unable to let a good fight with the media go to waste, Donald Trump insisted again on Thursday that his warning that Alabama could be hit by Hurricane Dorian was accurate. The federal National Weather Service (NWS) has said it was not. The president tweeted his fury about his own side of the matter a day after he displayed a National Hurricane Center (NHC) map in the Oval Office which appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie, or marker pen, to show the storm\u2019s predicted path reaching into the Yellowhammer state. On Wednesday night, Trump demanded apologies from the media. On Thursday morning, typically unabashed, he tweeted: \u201cIn the early days of the hurricane, when it was predicted that Dorian would go through Miami or West Palm Beach, even before it reached the Bahamas, certain models strongly suggested that Alabama [and] Georgia would be hit as it made its way through Florida [and] to the Gulf. NASA has all kinds of amazing shots of Dorian from the International Space Station, including a live video from this morning (the action picks up around the 7 minute mark). The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland is in Nassau, the Bahamas where the country\u2019s prime minister has warned of \u201cgeneral devastation\u201d in the archipelago\u2019s northern region: Large areas remain inaccessible to rescue crews, who continue to prioritise emergency evacuations, meaning the full scale of devastation caused by the hurricane is still not completely clear. Mark Lowcock, the United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told the Guardian that the agency estimates about 70,000 people in the northern Bahamas remain in need of relief assistance. At the main rescue centre in Nassau, the Bahamas capital city, US Coast Guard and Royal Marines helicopters arrived sporadically throughout the day bringing in dozens of rescued people from the Abacos Islands. Where Dorian is and where it is forecast to go The eye of Dorian is off the coast of South Carolina and it\u2019s moving north-northeast at 8 mph. The eye is projected to remain just off the coast of the eastern US, moving past South Carolina late Thursday. Strong wind gusts, flash floods and strong rains are forecast in the Carolinas as the storm moves north. It is expected to pass by North Carolina on Friday while weakening in strength. There is a high risk of flash flooding on the North and South Carolina coasts and a moderate risk of flash flooding in Virginia. Tornadoes have been spotted across the states because of the strong winds from Dorian. Hurricane Dorian is drenching North and South Carolina after devastating the Bahamas, where it left at least 20 people dead. Overnight, the eye of the hurricane churned off the coast of South Carolina, where dangerously high winds and rain caused power outages for tens of thousands of people. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said the category 3 strength hurricane could maintain intensity for several days before weakening through Saturday. We\u2019ll have updates here as the hurricane moves north as well as dispatches from the Bahamas and other regions most impacted by the storm.",

      "bodyText": "Those who dismiss England\u2019s final World Cup warm-up game against Italy as irrelevant clearly do not hail from a northern postcode. For many the overdue chance to see the national team play a capped Test in Newcastle makes it an auspicious occasion, one which will hopefully encourage the Rugby Football Union to stage further games outside Twickenham. If they need an example of exactly why showing the sport to a less familiar audience is so vitally important they need only talk to the England flanker Mark Wilson. In rugby terms the 29-year-old grew up off the beaten track in Kendal. For years he was a lonely teenage road warrior, commuting to training sessions at Newcastle Falcons. He never made it to an England game at Twickenham, partly because of the exorbitant costs and partly because \u201cit was just too far\u201d. His only option was to watch televised Six Nations games from afar. \u201cIt was on BBC wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Wilson says. \u201cRegardless of whether you had Sky or not, you could watch it.\u201d Hence the note of excitement in his voice when asked how it will feel to run out at St James\u2019 Park on Friday in an (albeit red) England jersey. \u201cIt\u2019ll be massive. Throughout my youth if you wanted to watch England you had to go down to Twickenham to see them. For families up north it\u2019s quite a big effort. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be pretty special for young north-east kids who love rugby to be able to go to St James\u2019 Park and watch England play.\u201d Given Wilson\u2019s family home in Blaydon is now only a short taxi ride away, he is also looking forward to a rest from his normal long-distance travelling routine after Tests in the south. \u201cThe lads have been having a joke with me because I\u2019m usually having to fly back after a game or catch the train. This time I can sit smugly in my house on Saturday night while other people do it,\u201d he says. To cap it all, even Wilson\u2019s mother, Janice, will be putting in a rare appearance. Her son has been playing top-level rugby for years but she has been seen in the stands only on a handful of occasions. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been to any of my games at Twickenham. She\u2019s a bit of a wimp \u2026 she doesn\u2019t like big crowds. With this one being in Newcastle I don\u2019t think she had an excuse. I think the last time she came was for my 200th game for the Falcons two seasons ago.\u201d His wife Amy\u2019s father, Andy, will also be there, hoping for a happier sequel to one of the family\u2019s favourite stories. \u201cMy family back in Cumbria aren\u2019t massive football supporters but Amy\u2019s family had season tickets at Newcastle. When Amy was a kid, she won a competition on the radio and the prize was to take a penalty at Alan Shearer\u2019s testimonial. She put her dad forward: he\u2019s a mad Geordie who loves football. \u201cHe went to the academy during the week to practise with Peter Beardsley and was banging them all in. But on the night of the game, at half-time, there\u2019s a different goalkeeper from the under-21s, who comes up to him and says: \u2018You\u2019re not going to score past me.\u2019 Then Andy took his penalty and missed. I think he hit the post. As long as I am more successful than him, that\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Should he happen to score a try against Italy he will probably resist a football-style celebration. \u201cI can\u2019t do the Shearer one. I suppose I could kick the hoardings down but I might never play for England again.\u201d Instead he will be focused on staking a claim for a place in England\u2019s increasingly competitive starting back row, having finally worked his way back to full fitness before the squad\u2019s departure for Japan on Sunday. Given Wilson is now officially listed as a Sale player, his loan move a consequence of Newcastle\u2019s relegation from the Premiership last season, it would be a fitting end to a rollercoaster year if he ends up starting in England\u2019s key World Cup games. To do so he will have to hold off the energetic challenge of the younger Tom Curry and strike a blow for the squad\u2019s elder statesmen. \u201cI\u2019ve gone as far as Love Island but I\u2019ve not gone as far as Instagram. I am probably just the boring old fart.\u201d As far as Eddie Jones and an expected 50,000 crowd are concerned, what matters rather more is the manner in which England attack their fourth and last buildup challenge. Italy have not named their strongest combinations and, if their hosts are the side they aspire to be, the scoreline could be an inflated one. Should the debutant Bath winger Ruaridh McConnochie and his fellow flyers Jonny May, Anthony Watson and Joe Marchant be given only fleeting opportunities to display their pace, the management will be as disappointed as the Geordie audience. All concerned will also be praying that untimely and depressing injuries to key individuals, not least Billy Vunipola and Owen Farrell, are also safely sidestepped. If a fit, happy England can fly east on Sunday evening having left farewell vapour trails across a raucous St James\u2019 Park, everyone save Italy will be happy.",

      "bodyText": "Better late than never. None of the forwards in the Republic of Ireland\u2019s squad had scored an international goal before this match, and for a long time here that statistic looked unlikely to change. But in the 85th minute of his 11th appearance for his country, David McGoldrick leapt high to send a powerful header into the net from eight yards, negating the lead that Fabian Sch\u00e4r had just given Switzerland. The Sheffield United\u2019s striker\u2019s goal was enough to earn a point that sustains Irish confidence that they can reach Euro 2020. The suspense is building nicely in Group D, where Mick McCarthy\u2019s team stand top, albeit having played more matches than their main rivals. They have a tough run-in \u2013 away to Georgia and Switzerland before hosting Denmark in their last game \u2013 but McCarthy said this performance suggests his team are at their best when the going gets tough. \u201cWe\u2019re not the best team in the group but I\u2019ll tell you what, you\u2019re going to have to put our players down before they give up, and that\u2019s a lovely trait to have,\u201d he said of his team. Switzerland, ranked 11th in the world, expected to close the gap in the group here by demonstrating a gulf in class between the teams. For much of the match they were indeed slicker, controlling possession and forcing the Irish to defend tigerishly. When the visitors managed to pick a way through that defence, they let themselves down with erratic finishing. Until, that is, a Newcastle United centre-back joined in one of their attacks in the 74th minute, arriving at the end of a lovely one-touch move to guide a low shot past Darren Randolph. That turned out to be the cue for Ireland to work up a storm. Switzerland, who let slip a 3-0 lead to draw with Denmark in an earlier group match, lost their composure and then their lead. Glen Whelan lashed a thunderous shot against the bar in the 84th minute and then, moments later, McGoldrick outjumped a defender to nod a deflected cross by James McClean into the net. In a sense it was fitting that Whelan and McGoldrick led the Irish fightback. The international careers of both players seemed to have run their course under Martin O\u2019Neill but have been revived by McCarthy. \u201cHe has always been an excellent player, certainly for me,\u201d said McCarthy of McGoldrick, whom he once signed for Ipswich Town. \u201cI\u2019m delighted he got his goal.

Irish press have accused the US vice-president, Mike Pence, of betrayal and \u201chumiliation\u201d during a visit in which the proud Irish American reiterated support for Brexit, with one columnist writing that the \u201cmuch-anticipated visitor \u2026 shat on the new carpet\u201d. The Loch Ness monster could be a giant eel, a team of scientists from New Zealand have suggested, after using DNA to document about 3,000 species in the loch. Opinion and analysis \u201cWith a cabinet in thrall to a ruinous hard-Brexit agenda and negotiations for a new withdrawal agreement with Brussels going nowhere, Mr Johnson is prepared to risk the country\u2019s economic stability by crashing out of the EU,\u201d reads the Guardian\u2019s editorial on Boris Johnson\u2019s latest cunning plan. It gives rise to the remarkable prospect of Johnson becoming the shortest-lived occupant of No 10 Downing Street at under 50 days, with an unlikely but not impossible scenario in which Jeremy Corbyn becomes the nation\u2019s next PM. \u201cMr Johnson\u2019s government could roll the dice on Monday and, in topsy-turvy times, call a vote of no confidence in itself. An election would follow if opposition parties could not form an alternative government after 14 days.\u201d As Mike Pence prepared for a meeting with the Irish president by staying at one of Donald Trump\u2019s hotels (more than 225km away), Ross Barkan wonders at what point corruption has become normalised? \u201cRepublicans have spent at least $20m at Trump-family hotels since 2015, according to a Center for Responsive Politics study, a brazen ethical breach that puts Trump in league with any craven, tinpot dictator straining to enrich family and friends at the expense of everyone else.\u201d Sport A double century for Steve Smith has put Australia in a commanding position to reclaim the Ashes, with the visitors declaring at 497-8 on day two before England lost their newly promoted opener Joe Denly to finish 23-1 at stumps. For a club of their talent, Geelong have not fared well in AFL finals, writes Jonathan Horn. It\u2019s a horror run since 2012 and it hangs over this weekend\u2019s key finals clash with Collingwood. Thinking time: Tina Arena on ageism in Australia Tina Arena still works as though there\u2019s a devil on her heels. Bursting on to Australian screens in 1974 in the children\u2019s talent show Young Talent Time, the little girl with a big voice was so popular with viewers that the station was inundated with requests to give her a regular spot. She worked six-day weeks during her seven years on the show while also studying. At 51 \u2013 still tiny, still with a big voice \u2013 Arena has endured decades in the public eye. One of the few globally famous Australian pop stars, she has sold more than 10m albums worldwide, with her second solo album, Don\u2019t Ask (1994), yielding the hits Sorrento Moon (I Remember) and Chains. She has worked across genres and media, appearing in musicals, on reality TV (Dancing with the Stars) and at music festivals. But as she tells Guardian Australia\u2019s Brigid Delaney, despite working unrelentingly, the landscape suddenly changed. \u201cI hated the fact I hit 40 and radio wouldn\u2019t play me. I think it\u2019s bullshit. I don\u2019t get it \u2026 Someone of a certain age and certain experience and certain gender is no longer relevant \u2013 says fucking who?\u201d Media roundup The leading regulators Allan Fels and Graeme Samuel are calling for major accounting firms to be banned from providing consulting advice to companies they are auditing, reports the Australian. Huang Xiangmo, the Chinese developer at the centre of the Icac inquiry into political donations to the NSW Labor party, has denied making any donations, according to the Australian Financial Review. And nine airline staff are facing charges of trafficking more than $20m of drugs, writes the Herald Sun. Coming up The will be a federal court hearing over the deportation of the Biloela Tamil asylum seeker family. Queensland\u2019s Crime and Corruption Commission will reveal whether it will investigate the deputy premier, Jackie Trad, over a house purchase.

There\u2019s no way that police officers should\u2019ve formed the backdrop to a speech of that nature.\u201d Burns-Williamson said he had expressed his concerns to the chief constable of West Yorkshire police and asked for an explanation around what happened. The prime minister, who will try again on Monday to force a general election through a vote in parliament, said there was \u201ca clear choice for the country\u201d between his vow to leave the EU by 31 October and Labour\u2019s plans. Labour MPs were quick to criticise the prime minister for his decision to deliver his speech flanked by police officers. Yvette Cooper MP, chair of the home affairs select committee, said: \u201cFor Boris Johnson to make so many police stop their training and work to be part of his political stunt is an abuse of power. Police officers and trainees are overstretched and need to be able to get on with their job, not have to waste time listening to Boris Johnson\u2019s political press conference.\u201d Fellow committee member Stephen Doughty MP said the speech appeared a \u201cblatant attempt to politicise our brilliant police\u201d ahead of an election campaign, adding: \u201cThey are not political props.\u201d As the officer immediately behind Johnson appeared to feel faint towards the end of his speech, he turned to see what was happening and appeared ready to draw to a close, but then continued speaking for several minutes. Much of the speech involved Johnson urging an election. \u201cI hate banging on about Brexit. I don\u2019t want to go about this any more,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want an election at all, but frankly I cannot see any other way. The only way to get this thing done, to get this thing moving, is to make that decision. \u201cDo you want this government to take us out on 31 October, or do you want Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party to go to that crucial summit in Brussels on 17 October, effectively hand over control to the EU and keep us in beyond 31 October? \u201cI think it\u2019s a no-brainer, and I\u2019m sorry to bring this painful subject up this afternoon, but that\u2019s the reality of what we face, and for me there can only be one way forward for our country.\u201d An investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative party, which he agreed to during his leadership election campaign live on television, was described instead as a general inquiry into \u201call manner of racism\u201d. \u201cWe are going to have a general inquiry into all manner of racism and hate crime as soon as that can be got under way, but I have to tell you, we have a zero-tolerance policy towards Islamophobia and all manner of hate crime and prejudice in the Conservative party, as you can imagine,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn is poised to reject Boris Johnson\u2019s demand for a 15 October election for a second time on Monday, with Labour fearing it would play into the prime minister\u2019s hands. Despite being taunted by Johnson as a \u201cchlorinated chicken\u201d who is afraid of facing the public, Corbyn is holding out for an election on Labour\u2019s own terms \u2013 most likely at a later date. The government has suggested that it will hold a vote on another motion under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act on Monday, a procedure that requires two-thirds of MPs to back it if it is to pass. Labour had considered whether it could amend the motion in order to fix the election date, to prevent Johnson changing it in order to force through a no-deal Brexit \u2013 but has been advised that any amendments would not have legal force. The Guardian understands no final decision has been made about Labour\u2019s tactics next week, but daily discussions are taking place with other key opposition figures including the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford and Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson.

It is not going anywhere, but it will be a marker in the sand,\u201d said Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. \u201cThe two-state solution is doomed and this plan will seal its end. It will create a new normal in the conflict, for future US administrations.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jason Greenblatt, the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy for Middle East peace, tasked with working on the \u201cultimate deal\u201d for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is to leave the post, it has been announced. Greenblatt may stay in the role until the publication of the long-delayed plan, which is now due to come out some time after Israeli elections on 17 September. However, if those elections bring about the fall of Donald Trump\u2019s close ally, Benjamin Netanyahu, the plan could be shelved indefinitely. \u201cGreenblatt\u2019s leaving may have to do with the dim prospects of the so-called peace plan,\u201d said Khaled Elgindy, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, and author of a book on US policy towards the Palestinians, Blind Spot. \u201cWhat I do know is that it won\u2019t make any difference to what is not really a plan \u2013 let\u2019s call it a vision \u2013 because there is no chance of it going anywhere.\u201d Donald Trump tweeted that Greenblatt, one of his former lawyers, would be leaving \u201cto pursue work in the private sector\u201d. \u201cJason has been a loyal and great friend and fantastic lawyer,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHis dedication to Israel and to seeking peace between Israel and the Palestinians won\u2019t be forgotten. He will be missed. Thank you Jason!\u201d Greenblatt tweeted back his thanks to Trump and said the envoy job had been \u201cthe honor of a lifetime\u201d. \u201cSo grateful to have worked on the potential to improve the lives of millions of Israelis, Palestinians &amp; others,\u201d the envoy said. Greenblatt, a real estate lawyer with no experience in diplomacy, began working on the would-be plan in 2017 with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in what the president has said would be the \u201cultimate deal\u201d. It was reported on Thursday that a 30 year-old Kushner aide, Avi Berkowitz \u2013 who graduated from law school in 2016 and has no Middle East experience, would take over some of Greenblatt\u2019s role, while the state department\u2019s special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, would broaden his responsibilities to include Israel and the Palestinian territories. During Greenblatt\u2019s time in office, the US severed its diplomatic links with the Palestinians, closed down its consulate in Jerusalem, and ordered the Palestinian mission in Washington to shut down. Earlier this year, the US cut all aid to the Palestinian territories. \u201cThe Trump administration inherited very poor prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace, which wasn\u2019t their fault,\u201d said Daniel Shapiro, the former US ambassador to Israel. \u201cBut everything they have done in the field since has made it even harder to achieve a breakthrough.\u201d Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, said Greenblatt had spent his time in the role as \u201can apologist for the most extreme, hardline government in the history of Israel\u201d. \u201cI think the Palestinians as a whole are going to say good riddance,\u201d she added. The only part of the Kushner-Greenblatt scheme that has been made public was an economic \u201cworkshop\u201d in Bahrain, which was intended to drum up interest in investment in the future of the Palestinian territories. However, it was boycotted by most Palestinian businesses. \u201cIt was a wish list of economic projects, not tied to a political horizon,\u201d Elgindy said. Although little is known for certain about the Kushner-Greenblatt plan, Trump officials have made it clear it will not commit to supporting the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel, which was the policy of previous US administrations. Netanyahu has promised this year to annex Israeli settlements in the West Bank, a move widely interpreted as killing of the already moribund two-state ideal that previous peace efforts have focused on. Kushner, Greenblatt and the current US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman have all been supportive of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and few expect the plan to put pressure on Israel to withdraw them. \u201cThe plan is doomed. It is not going anywhere, but it will be a marker in the sand,\u201d said Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. \u201cThe two-state solution is doomed and this plan will seal its end. It will create a new normal in the conflict, for future US administrations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "For a while in mid\u2011afternoon as the score ticked along, the white shapes moved listlessly about the Old Trafford turf and the men in green helmets punched gloves at some fresh milestone, something odd seemed to happen. Squint a little and the picture began to dissolve. Baggy-jeaned ghosts shuffled at the edge of the stands. Jangly guitar music seemed to float across the Manchester skyline. And for two and a half hours between lunch and tea on the second day of this fourth Test England went back to the 90s. In Ashes terms that was the decade of sessions from hell, of howlers and shockers, of bursts of defining English ineptitude. Proper Cricket Men will say you can\u2019t win the Ashes in a session \u2013 but you can lose them. It is probably too early to suggest England managed this in Manchester. But they did their very best across a rain-extended middle session that brought two dropped catches; the dismissal of Steve Smith, Test cricket\u2019s own next generation terminator, from a front-foot no-ball; assorted barks and gripes and fallings-out in the field; and finally the departure of Ben Stokes from the field with a twinge (mercifully short-lived) in his shoulder. Get back to the 90s! As the endless afternoon wore on you half expected Martin McCague to come bustling in from the pavilion end, or Ronnie Irani and Mark Lathwell to produce a slapstick fielding mishap on the deep midwicket rope. Either way a position of some strength at lunch, with two early wickets taken, had proved to be fool\u2019s gold; blown away by two and a half hours of spills, thrills and bellyaches. It was also a period of illumination as much as anything else. Test cricket is a brutal game, but not brutal in the way it seemed at Headingley, a game of explosive last\u2011ditch jeopardy. It is instead brutal like this. It wears you thin, peels away the layers, strips out the froth, leaves you pinned and wriggling on the turf. Occasionally it exposes you to the full range of a batting genius like Smith, who continued to do the same thing he has done throughout the series; but did so here to a degree that will haunt some of these England players, and indeed the England captain. Smith\u2019s scores now in this series are: 144, 142, 92 and 211, at a time when almost every other top\u2011order player has appeared to be batting with a length of plastic drainpipe on the deck of a storm-tossed dinghy. Up to this point England have worked around Smith, absorbing the hits at Edgbaston and Lord\u2019s. Here his brilliance became an instrument of torture. The step to leg, the flick off the hip, the thrilling launch through cover: England\u2019s bowlers will see these things in their sleep. Plus there\u2019s the other stuff.

      "bodyText": "Taken at some point in the 1970s and ostensibly depicting a harmonious upper-class British family, it is a picture that will likely lodge itself in modern UK political history. While the family nanny, Mary Kidd, stands unobtrusively behind, from left to right the photo features Boris Johnson at the age of 10, his brother Leo (seven), their sister Rachel (nine) their parents, Charlotte and Stanley and their youngest brother Jo. While a certain wilfulness was apparent even then in the pose of the older Johnson boy \u2013 who even at an early age was pronouncing his ambition to be \u201cworld king\u201d \u2013 few might have guessed that Jo, the smiling blonde boy prancing on the right, would emerge in time as the clan\u2019s standard bearer for remaining in Europe. More than that, however, the citing by Jo Johnson on Thursday of the \u201cunresolvable tension\u201d between family loyalty and national interest as being the reason for his decision to quit as an MP and minister reflects the extent to which Brexit has divided not just the UK, but the family itself. The figure of Stanley looms large in any narrative of the Johnson tribe, albeit as one in which biographers record him as being largely absent for much of his children\u2019s early upbringing. While in the US to study creative writing, for example, he was not at his wife\u2019s side when she gave birth to Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson in New York, in June 1964, the son with whom he shares a blend of barely concealed ambition and wit. By the middle of the 1970s, after landing a job at the European commission, he was to take a more significant parenting role as bouts of depression led to the repeated hospitalisation of his first wife, Charlotte. These days, Stanley, 79, a former MEP, remains a visible and vocal supporter of his eldest son, even if his support for remain during the 2016 referendum has led some to question the depth of his commitment to leaving the EU. By contrast, his daughter Rachel has continued to fiercely oppose Brexit. A journalist whose CV includes stints at the Financial Times and as editor of The Lady, the one-time Liberal Democrat ran as a lead candidate for Change UK during this year\u2019s European parliamentary elections, although she later described herself as a \u201crat that jumped on to a sinking ship\u201d. As the spotlight fell on the family after Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation on Thursday, she was quick to dismiss suggestions of familial strife, tweeting: \u201cI said last night at a charity do that the family avoids the topic of Brexit, especially at meals, as we don\u2019t want to gang up on the PM!\u201d Of the other siblings, Leo Johnson has distanced himself from politics, having built a career in the City and as a co-host of a Radio 4 series that explores how innovation could transform the way society functions. Nevertheless, his retweeting of remain accounts has been noted, not least a recent one criticising the role of the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, and another lambasting \u201cholier than thou so-called upholders of democracy\u201d for repeating a mantra about the need to deliver Brexit. For the second time in less than than a year, meanwhile, the departure from government of Jo Johnson has narrowed scrutiny of the family\u2019s Brexit divisions to the relationship between him and his louder, older brother. A former investment banker and journalist who is married to Amelia Gentleman, a reporter for the Guardian, he was appointed director of the No 10 policy unit by David Cameron in 2008 and became an MP in 2010 for what was then the safe Conservative seat of Orpington, in the London borough of Bromley. Described by one commentator and Dallas aficionado as Bobby Ewing to Boris\u2019s \u201ccharismatic, naughty JR\u201d, Jo Johnson has long concealed any rivalry, even if others have suggested that the quieter brother would have taken some satisfaction from being the first Johnson in Downing Street. By the time Jo Johnson quit Theresa May\u2019s government in November last year, calling for the public to have a fresh say on Brexit, some onlookers had even begun to envisage the struggle between the two brothers turning into one for No 10. While Boris enjoyed a near cult following among some parts of the party\u2019s grassroots, to other, more moderate Tories, the other Johnson presented a potential way to reconnect with younger voters, remainers or those repelled by his elder brother\u2019s inconsistent relationship with the truth and accusations of racism. On Jo Johnson\u2019s second dramatic exit from government, and with the axis of power in the Tory party now having shifted definitively to the hard Brexit right, such a scenario appears as distant as the Johnson clan\u2019s lazy childhood summers. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 September 2019 because an earlier version referred to Jo Johnson quitting May\u2019s cabinet. Rather he quit her government.",

      "body": "<p>London\u2019s economy has outstripped all other English regions with a 19% surge in growth since 2012, highlighting the divide between the capital and the rest of England.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics underlined the city\u2019s disproportionate economic heft in its first set of regional GDP figures for England and Wales, which showed the north-east with the slowest growth over the same period at 5.9%.</p> <p>The West Midlands economy, home to the UK\u2019s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, came second to London after it expanded 16.5% over six years from 2012 to the end of 2018.</p> <p>The figures are likely to reinforce calls for the government to renew focus on its industrial strategy, which is struggling for impetus as Whitehall pours resources into Brexit preparations.</p> <p>Carys Roberts, chief economist at the IPPR thinktank and head of the Centre for Economic Justice, said: \u201cThe fact that growth from all regions of England has consistently lagged behind that from London is a clear indicator that something is wrong in the economy. Such regional inequalities hold back productivity, wages and people\u2019s standard of living and quality of life.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a new industrial strategy act setting out clear goals that focus on putting this right. We should be building high-tech industrial clusters around our many world-leading research-based universities. And we should set up a new national investment bank to invest in infrastructure, innovation and business growth across England.\u201d</p> <p>However, the ONS figures, compiled from about 1.9m VAT returns supplied by businesses rather than the traditional GDP method of company surveys, included quarterly data for 2018 that showed a downturn in London\u2019s fortunes. The capital\u2019s economy showed no growth in the last three months of 2018, while Wales topped the table in the final quarter with growth of 0.3%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/ons_regional_gdp/giv-3902gK1AhfCxOf5M/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/ons_regional_gdp/giv-3902gK1AhfCxOf5M/\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>A flagging financial services sector was largely to blame for London\u2019s zero growth rate , having been affected by Brexit uncertainty that has resulted in thousands of jobs leaving the capital\u2019s financial district. According to the ONS data, London\u2019s financial services sector has been in recession since the third quarter of 2017. London\u2019s building industry has also proved sensitive to Brexit uncertainty, with a host of projects mothballed. However, the downturns in two key London industries have not reduced the sizeable gap with other parts of the country.</p> <p>The worst-affected region most recently, according to the new figures, was the south-west. Its economy shrank in the last three months of 2018 compared with a year earlier. The figures also show that the east and south-west of England suffered technical recessions, or two successive quarters of negative growth, last year.</p> <p>Representatives of the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d in Manchester and the mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, have called for greater powers and more funds for infrastructure projects, including the much-delayed and overbudget HS2 railway line, which is intended to run from London to Birmingham, then Manchester and Leeds. However, the future of HS2 is in doubt after the government confirmed this week that the first phase of the line could be delayed by five years while the cost of the entire route has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/03/hs2-to-be-delayed-by-up-to-five-years\">risen from \u00a355.7bn to up to \u00a388bn</a>.</p> <p>The Welsh economy grew in the second half of 2018, despite fears that steelworks closures and threats to the livelihoods of sheep farmers would harm the country\u2019s overall economic performance. Construction was the main driver of Wales\u2019s economic performance, while manufacturing output fell.</p> <p>But it was outstripped in the final quarter of 2018 by the south-east, which expanded by 0.8%.</p> <p>Economists expect the West Midlands to drop back this year as the dramatic fall in car purchases and production takes its toll on the vehicle industry. Much of the construction boom in Birmingham and the surrounding area has also followed government assurances that HS2 would be operational in the middle of the next decade.</p> <p>The car industry represents one of England\u2019s biggest economic strengths outside of London, with Nissan operating a key site in Sunderland, Toyota having a presence in Derby, Mini running a plant in Oxford and Vauxhall operating sites in Ellesmere Port and Luton.</p> <p>The ONS said it planned to continue using VAT data to build a more comprehensive picture of economic growth in the UK, although Scotland and Northern Ireland produce their own data, using a different methodology.</p>",

      "bodyText": "London\u2019s economy has outstripped all other English regions with a 19% surge in growth since 2012, highlighting the divide between the capital and the rest of England. The Office for National Statistics underlined the city\u2019s disproportionate economic heft in its first set of regional GDP figures for England and Wales, which showed the north-east with the slowest growth over the same period at 5.9%. The West Midlands economy, home to the UK\u2019s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, came second to London after it expanded 16.5% over six years from 2012 to the end of 2018. The figures are likely to reinforce calls for the government to renew focus on its industrial strategy, which is struggling for impetus as Whitehall pours resources into Brexit preparations. Carys Roberts, chief economist at the IPPR thinktank and head of the Centre for Economic Justice, said: \u201cThe fact that growth from all regions of England has consistently lagged behind that from London is a clear indicator that something is wrong in the economy. Such regional inequalities hold back productivity, wages and people\u2019s standard of living and quality of life. \u201cWe need a new industrial strategy act setting out clear goals that focus on putting this right. We should be building high-tech industrial clusters around our many world-leading research-based universities. And we should set up a new national investment bank to invest in infrastructure, innovation and business growth across England.\u201d However, the ONS figures, compiled from about 1.9m VAT returns supplied by businesses rather than the traditional GDP method of company surveys, included quarterly data for 2018 that showed a downturn in London\u2019s fortunes. The capital\u2019s economy showed no growth in the last three months of 2018, while Wales topped the table in the final quarter with growth of 0.3%. A flagging financial services sector was largely to blame for London\u2019s zero growth rate , having been affected by Brexit uncertainty that has resulted in thousands of jobs leaving the capital\u2019s financial district. According to the ONS data, London\u2019s financial services sector has been in recession since the third quarter of 2017. London\u2019s building industry has also proved sensitive to Brexit uncertainty, with a host of projects mothballed. However, the downturns in two key London industries have not reduced the sizeable gap with other parts of the country. The worst-affected region most recently, according to the new figures, was the south-west. Its economy shrank in the last three months of 2018 compared with a year earlier. The figures also show that the east and south-west of England suffered technical recessions, or two successive quarters of negative growth, last year. Representatives of the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d in Manchester and the mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, have called for greater powers and more funds for infrastructure projects, including the much-delayed and overbudget HS2 railway line, which is intended to run from London to Birmingham, then Manchester and Leeds. However, the future of HS2 is in doubt after the government confirmed this week that the first phase of the line could be delayed by five years while the cost of the entire route has risen from \u00a355.7bn to up to \u00a388bn. The Welsh economy grew in the second half of 2018, despite fears that steelworks closures and threats to the livelihoods of sheep farmers would harm the country\u2019s overall economic performance. Construction was the main driver of Wales\u2019s economic performance, while manufacturing output fell. But it was outstripped in the final quarter of 2018 by the south-east, which expanded by 0.8%. Economists expect the West Midlands to drop back this year as the dramatic fall in car purchases and production takes its toll on the vehicle industry. Much of the construction boom in Birmingham and the surrounding area has also followed government assurances that HS2 would be operational in the middle of the next decade. The car industry represents one of England\u2019s biggest economic strengths outside of London, with Nissan operating a key site in Sunderland, Toyota having a presence in Derby, Mini running a plant in Oxford and Vauxhall operating sites in Ellesmere Port and Luton. The ONS said it planned to continue using VAT data to build a more comprehensive picture of economic growth in the UK, although Scotland and Northern Ireland produce their own data, using a different methodology.",

Tim Paine won a good toss before Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith neutralised any momentum England might have been carrying into the match following Ben Stokes\u2019s heroics at Headingley. <br></p> <p>Only 44 overs were possible and with further rain delays likely over the next couple of days, it may prove difficult for either side to force a positive result on a surface that has so far proven the easiest to bat on this series. With runs on the board and England batting last on a pitch expected to break up and facilitate spin, Australia are in the box seat. For the hosts to assert themselves on the contest the opening hour of play will be vital.<br></p> <p>There will be plenty of scrutiny on Jofra Archer during the early exchanges. The emerging star underwhelmed for the first time in his international career yesterday, bowling without intent for portions, reflecting a general demeanour that suggested he did not relish his time in the field on such a wintry day. Joe Root must demand more from his spearhead. </p> <p>If you don\u2019t know the drill by now, I am holding the fort for the next hour or so until play begins but once the action gets underway I\u2019ll hand you over to Adam Collins at Old Trafford.

      "bodyText": "10th over: England 23-1 (Burns 15, Overton 3) Paine banishes Lyon after that single pricey over and recalls Hazlewood. Overton gets forward to the full ones and ducks the short ones, and that\u2019s stumps. It\u2019s been Australia\u2019s day, no question, but England have done quite well to keep nine wickets intact. They are a mere 474 runs behind. Steve Smith trots up the stairs to the dressing-room, no doubt wondering why on earth he played that reverse sweep when a 250 was there for the taking. Thanks for your company, correspondence and gallows humour. 9th over: England 23-1 (Burns 15, Overton 3) Overton sees out four dots from Cummins before glancing for a single, not far from the man at leg slip. A stat pops up on Twitter from Cric Viz. \u201cThe last English genuine batsman to play seven Tests with a lower Test average than Joe Denly was Craig White.\u201d That\u2019s a backhand compliment to White, who was mainly in the team as a fast bowler. 8th over: England 22-1 (Burns 15, Overton 2) Tim Paine, enjoying himself after the horror show at Headingley, tries a bit of Nathan Lyon. Burns handles him well, rocking back to cut, riding his luck with an under-edge, then cutting again. Ten off the over. 7th over: England 12-1 (Burns 5, Overton 2) Craig Overton, preferred to Jack Leach as nightwatchman, starts well, with a purposeful prod for two. Cummins cuts Denly in half with one lifter, then persuades him to edge another into his thigh pad, which gives Matthew Wade a sharp juggling catch at short leg. And England\u2019s latest opening partnership does no better than the one before. 6th over: England 10-0 (Burns 5, Denly 4) Hazlewood has Burns jagging out of the way of a sharp lifter, just outside off, but another over is safely negotiated. \u201cWe went four overs without a comedy wicket!\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cEngland have got this!\u201d 5th over: England 9-0 (Burns 5, Denly 4) Pat Cummins replaces Starc \u2013 well, let\u2019s face it, he didn\u2019t bowl half as well as he\u2019d batted. Each batsman picks up a three into the covers, and Burns adds a single to mid-on. The crowd are cheering every run. And here\u2019s my colleague Emma John, anchor of The Spin podcast, emailing from Old Trafford. \u201cConsidering that we could see the way the wind was (literally) blowing yesterday,\u201d she writes, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I should have expected any better than this. But what a grim old afternoon it\u2019s been. Actually things have gone so far past grim they\u2019ve come out the other side. You can\u2019t feel the pain any more. We\u2019re all in a dissociated state\u2026 there was a bizarre moment just before Australia declared when the entire temporary stand started throwing their cardboard beerholders in the air. Just, I think, to feel alive.\u201d 4th over: England 2-0 (Burns 1, Denly 1) Hazlewood strays onto the pads, allowing Burns to open his account \u2013 that magnificently inappropriate expression for scoring your first run when two fast bowlers are racing in at you, smelling blood. Denly is beaten on his inside edge, prompting an LBW shout, and then on the outside too, but England survive another over. 3rd over: England 1-0 (Burns 0, Denly 1) Bowling to Denly, Starc starts by reprising his over to Burns \u2013 one block, two leaves. But then there\u2019s a nasty bouncer which thuds into Denly\u2019s wrist as, like Burns, he takes his eye off the ball. There could be an awful lot of chin music in this innings. Back to Smith. \u201cHis middle names,\u201d says Boris Starling, \u201care Peter Devereux, which has always struck me as a good name for a detective: dogged but with a touch of flamboyance (whatever the crime-fiction equivalent of the lightsabre leave is). Perhaps DCI Devereux\u2019 first case could be to investigate the appearance of an apparently immovable object in Manchester?\u201d 2nd over: England 1-0 (Burns 0, Denly 1) Josh Hazlewood, unlike Starc, needs no looseners. He raps Joe Denly in the midriff, then beats him outside off, twice. For a 33-year-old top-order batsman, Denly seems a little too fond of the cover drive. A better shot, a forward push with soft hands, gets him and England off the mark. Hazlewood finishes with a vicious lifter at Burns, who ducks into it and takes a blow to the shoulder. 1st over: England 0-0 (Burns 0, Denly 0) Starc gives Rory Burns one ball to block and five to leave. That\u2019ll do nicely for England. \u201cAfternoon everybody,\u201d says Anthony Hulse. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see that this game is going perfectly to plan for England. First up, let your opponent score 500ish including a double century over the course of a couple of days. Next, bat for a couple of days yourself and pretty much equal their score. Finally, on the last day, skittle them and then knock the runs off in the final session. Stokes\u2019 Headingley miracle and finally avenging Adelaide pulled off as part of one magnificent strategy to inflict maximum misery on Australia. Genius!\u201d So England need 298 to avoid the follow-on, and Headingley seems a hundred years ago. The first target is to make it through these 10 overs or so without losing more than one wicket. Mitchell Starc, fresh from a cheery fifty, has the new ball. 125th over: Australia 497-8 (Starc 54, Lyon 26) Root keeps himself on, which is selfless \u2013 he could be batting in about 12 minutes. His sixth successive over brings four byes, a slog for four from Lyon and a declaration. Archer escapes without running up a hundred, and England will have to bat for about 40 minutes. See you in a bit. 124th over: Australia 486-8 (Starc 53, Lyon 20) England have \u201ca very very deep backstop,\u201d says David Gower. \u201cNothing to do with Brexit.\u201d Lyon rises to the challenge and flashes past the man in question, Stokes, for four more. 124th over: Australia 479-8 (Starc 53, Lyon 15) Four runs off Root\u2019s over. Time for a declaration, surely. 123rd over: Australia 477-8 (Starc 50, Lyon 14) Archer aims out of the batsmen\u2019s reach, and they get only a couple of singles, but it\u2019s enough for Starc to reach a beefy fifty. Maybe Australia missed a trick by not having him batting in the first three Tests. 122nd over: Australia 475-8 (Starc 49, Lyon 13) Root limits the damage, conceding only three. 121st over: Australia 472-8 (Starc 48, Lyon 11) Starc lays into Archer, sending a flailing pull for six to third man, where Jos Buttler makes a brave attempt at a diving catch. Archer has none for 90, and his Test average has even gone above 20. 120th over: Australia 463-8 (Starc 40, Lyon 10) Starc wallops a six off Root, who retorts with a review for LBW \u2013 but a good straight ball has brushed the glove. Starc keeps on slogging and picks up two more fours. That\u2019s drinks, with England feeding off a few crumbs of consolation, and Australia exacting a measure of revenge for the hiding at Headingley. 119th over: Australia 447-8 (Starc 25, Lyon 9) Archer replaces Broad and Lyon rides his luck, hooking close to the man at fine leg, then cutting with more conviction. Archer has none for 81 as the law of averages goes after him. 118th over: Australia 439-8 (Starc 25, Lyon 1) The partnership between Smith and Starc was a breezy 51, enough to make it tricky for England to avoid the follow-on, as they must to keep the Ashes alive. Never mind Denly, there\u2019ll be a case for opening the batting with Joe Leach. At last! Smith tries a reverse-sweep and hits it straight to Joe Denly at backward point. That\u2019s a comical end to an epic innings. And Root gets his man, about 200 runs later than he would have liked. 117th over: Australia 432-7 (Smith 206, Starc 24) England have a few wounds and Starc sees the chance to rub some salt in them. He glances Broad, then straight-drives him, then straight-lofts him, then flashes behind point: four fours in a row. That\u2019s the kind of cultured violence Broad himself used to bring to Ashes Tests. And Damian Burns isn\u2019t happy. \u201cI just hate that the picture on the top of the feed is the ball perfectly in the centre of Smith\u2019s bat. Can you tell the editors to Photoshop its position slightly to give us some hope?\u201d 116th over: Australia 415-7 (Smith 205, Starc 8) Smith has now driven Root to give himself a bowl. He fires it in at Starc, gets some turn, has a stifled appeal for LBW and goes for only two, which is a tiny triumph. 115th over: Australia 413-7 (Smith 205, Starc 6) To celebrate, Smith produces a lightsabre leave, a play-and-miss, and an imperious on drive for four. And here\u2019s Luke Baxter. \u201cI have just walked to the spot on the island of Lesbos from which Sappho is said to have thrown herself to her death. Fortunately, much like in her times, 4G didn\u2019t reach so I was unable to see that Smith is still batting. Otherwise I might have found myself following the great lyric poet!\u201d That, Luke, is the acceptable face of elegant variation. Broad comes back, Smith steps across his stumps for the thousandth time and flicks for two to reach 201. He raises both arms in triumph, as well he may. This is what a run machine looks like. 114th over: Australia 407-7 (Smith 199, Starc 6) Overton continues, when it\u2019s surely time for another burst from Archer or Broad. Smith opens the face to glide another single, and again mutters about not reaching 200. He\u2019s such a complete batsman, he even sledges himself. \u201cWhich ends first?\u201d asks Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cSmith\u2019s innings or Boris\u2019 premiership?\u201d 113th over: Australia 406-7 (Smith 198, Starc 6) Smith brings up the 400 in the grand manner, lofting Leach inside-out over extra cover for six. He then late-cuts, so late that the ball is almost in Bairstow\u2019s gloves, and berates himself for getting only a single. 112th over: Australia 399-7 (Smith 191, Starc 6) Overton is finding some movement away from the left-handed Starc, who first plays at thin air, then edges, tantalisingly short of Stokes at second slip. Finding his feet, Starc thumps down the ground for four. 111th over: Australia 395-7 (Smith 191, Starc 2) Smith goes back to Leach and misses a cut; next ball, he goes forward and misses a prod. Moral victories. Here\u2019s John Starbuck, picking up on John Phaceas\u2019s quip from the 108th over. \u201cI recognised Hodor as a GoT reference though I\u2019ve never watched it, but I do know the original Hodr in Norse myth did actually hit his target.\u201d Only on the OBO. 110th over: Australia 394-7 (Smith 191, Starc 1) Smith falls over trying to play the sort of drive that brought him his fifty, several months ago now. All that happens this time is a play-and-miss. 109th over: Australia 393-7 (Smith 191, Starc 1) Starc\u2019s off the mark with a clump to long-on, who surely should be at mid-on to tempt him into a mow. Leach has two for 75, Overton two for 79. They\u2019ve done a decent job, apart from that no-ball, but it all feels too like the last Ashes series. 108th over: Australia 391-7 (Smith 190, Starc 0) Overton\u2019s row of dots comes to an end as he drops short and Smith pulls for four. \u201cI know that Manchester is a bit like Winterfell,\u201d John Phaceas said a while back, \u201cbut not sure about England\u2019s selection of Hodor as the third seamer.\u201d 107th over: Australia 387-7 (Smith 186, Starc 0) Cummins\u2019 downfall was that he lunged forward at Leach. Mitchell Starc, finally making his first appearance of the series, hangs back and keeps Leach out. 106th over: Australia 387-7 (Smith 186, Starc 0) Overton has two jobs now \u2013 to stop Smith nicking the strike, as well as boring him rigid. He manages both with a maiden. 105th over: Australia 387-7 (Smith 186, Starc 0) Before that, seeing a perfectly decent delivery from Leach, Smith turned it into a full-toss and clipped it for four. \u201cCan you think of a batsman who made so few mistakes?\u201d asks Matt Fordham. \u201cI really can\u2019t. Smith appears vulnerable, as we all know, but never seems to miss a ball. Those with unusual techniques usually get found out after a year or two but he just keeps getting better and better. At least if he bats all day today I won\u2019t have to watch him when I go to Old Trafford on Saturday. If there is still a game on then.\u201d The collapse is on. Leach produces a classical delivery, straightening on off, and Cummins gives Stokes a simple catch at slip. Shades of Phil Edmonds, Headingley 1975. 104th over: Australia 382-6 (Smith 181, Cummins 4) Overton, who is just about fit enough to continue, decides it\u2019s time to try and bore Smith out by bowling wide of off. \u201cMy only problem with that,\u201d says Michael Holding, \u201cis that it\u2019s 170 runs too late.\u201d Smith decides it\u2019s time to bring out the lightsabre leave. 103rd over: Australia 380-6 (Smith 180, Cummins 4) Smith, facing his first ball since tea, takes one look at Leach, charges down the track and parks a full-toss smack on the Toblerone. That\u2019s the first six of the match. 102nd over: Australia 373-6 (Smith 173, Cummins 4) Cummins is off the mark, tickling Overton for four, and Overton seems to have hurt his back. Stokes\u2019s injury turns out to have been to his shoulder, and Broad slipped and appeared to hurt himself before tea, so it\u2019s now The New Bradman v The Walking Wounded. First ball after tea! Fortified by a cuppa and a change of ends, Overton bowls an away-seamer so gentle (74mph) that Paine is bamboozled into getting a nick. \u201cA bit pessimistic,\u201d says Mark Ellis, \u201ctalking about an innings defeat [97th over]. Not all of England\u2019s first innings will end at 67 all out.\u201d True. I said it had come into play. \u201cThis has got draw written all over it. Then to the Oval where there will be a positive result.\u201d If offered that now, Joe Root might take it. 101st over: Australia 369-5 (Smith 173, Paine 58) Joe Denly comes on, does OK but drops one ball short, so Smith goes back and whacks him through midwicket with a straight bat \u2013 thereby inventing a new stroke, the pull-drive. And that\u2019s tea, with Australia right on top, and Smith threatening to give Bradman some company at the summit after all these years. See you shortly. 100th over: Australia 364-5 (Smith 169, Paine 57) Leach keeps both batsmen quiet by bowling over the wicket into the rough. If you listen hard, you may well be able to hear Nathan Lyon licking his lips. 99th over: Australia 362-5 (Smith 168, Paine 56) Archer gets a half-false shot out of Smith, whose upper cut lands just short of Denly at third man, while Paine produces a much better stroke, cutting for four. Archer does find some late swing \u2013 so late that the ball has already passed the bat \u2013 and raps Bairstow on the thumb. A physio comes on to stick some tape on it, giving us a close-up of Bairstow\u2019s hand, which looks like something from a children\u2019s book called Mr Plaster. 98th over: Australia 355-5 (Smith 167, Paine 50) Jack Leach replaces Overton and Tim Paine, after spending about a week on 49, pushes a single to reach an important fifty. The cricket gods are doing a lot of levelling here: Paine has been good, Stokes awful, Archer middling, Leach an unlikely villain. 97th over: Australia 353-5 (Smith 166, Paine 49) Even on his first bad day, Archer looks the bowler most likely to break through. A short ball has Smith edging down the leg side, past Bairstow, for a streaky four. Archer touches 90.5mph, but still no dice. England have now reached the point where an innings defeat comes into play, and that means the forecast rain is less likely to save them. 96th over: Australia 349-5 (Smith 162, Paine 49) Overton is doing what county bowlers do, dishing up one bad ball an over. Smith on-drives him for four, so Root switches to Plan Z, with two short mid-offs and no second slip. Overton responds by drifting onto leg stump, to hand Smith an easy two. The only crumb of comfort for Root is that Stokes has reappeared. 95th over: Australia 342-5 (Smith 155, Paine 49) Archer\u2019s bouncers are unsettling Paine, who plays a shaky shovel-hook, short of short leg \u2013 quite an achievement in its way. Then Smith goes down for a word, and Paine ducks the last two balls. Archer has none for 62 from his 21 overs. On Twitter, James Doleman asks: \u201cCan England prorogue the Ashes?\u201d 94th over: Australia 342-5 (Smith 155, Paine 49) Overton is bowling full, to maximise the swing, but Smith is seeing it like that beach ball from yesterday and he just creams another drive through the covers. And here\u2019s Gary Naylor. \u201cEngland did win the last Test didn\u2019t they @TimdeLisle?\u201d Ha. 93rd over: Australia 338-5 (Smith 151, Paine 49) Jofra Archer comes back to replace the stricken Stokes. Smith, unperturbed, plays a pull for three to reach the first 150 of the series. Root semaphores from slip to Archer, telling him to bowl round the wicket to Paine. Archer, 50 yards away, replies with the international body language for \u201cwho, me?\u201d. Archer digs it in, and Paine is dropped by Sam Curran, a tough low chance at midwicket, but he got to it. I take it all back (previous over). 92nd over: Australia 335-5 (Smith 148, Paine 49) Overton squeezes a thick inside edge out of Paine, but it connects only with his back pad. Steady as Overton has been, England could do with Sam Curran\u2019s ability to make things happen. \u201cWith Smith\u2019s invincibility in mind,\u201d says Kim Thonger, \u201cI wonder if we should start to think about a handicapping system, similar to that used in golf, or horseracing. So the higher a batsman\u2019s average, the more he is penalised, to even things out, perhaps by shaving bits off his bat or partially blindfolding him. My wife has suggested chopping off bits of fingers, but this seems overly harsh and likely to upset frail and elderly MCC members. (Some may view that as a bonus.)\u201d 91st over: Australia 334-5 (Smith 147, Paine 49) England have gone flat, so Joe Root turns to Ben Stokes. His last spell was so bad that he must be planning something magnificent for the weekend. This over picks up where he left off earlier, with one half-volley driven for four by Paine and another blocked for three. After five balls, Stokes walks off with what looks like a strained muscle or hamstring. Bad to worse. A tweet comes in from Voice of the Mysterons. \u201cWinViz shows England with a 5% chance of winning this, which is 4% more chance that it gave them at Headingly. England it is, then\u2026\u201d 90th over: Australia 325-5 (Smith 145, Paine 42) Paine has reached the happy state when you just wait for the bad ball and stroke it for four. This time it\u2019s a tame half-volley from Overton, eased past extra cover. And with that, in terms of overs, we\u2019ve reached the end of the first day. 89th over: Australia 321-5 (Smith 145, Paine 38) Paine hooks Broad, unconvincingly as usual, but picks up a single. Smith duly goes past his own series best. He has the most Test runs of anyone this year, and he didn\u2019t even start till August 1. Crazy stat, crazy guy. 88th over: Australia 318-5 (Smith 144, Paine 36) Another little victory for Australia: Jofra Archer is taken off. Craig Overton comes on and at least manages a maiden. He has a strangled LBW shout against Smith, fruitless because the ball struck him outside the line of off and he was playing a shot. 87th over: Australia 318-5 (Smith 144, Paine 36) Thanks Adam and hello everyone. When Tim Paine is making runs, you know England are in trouble. Broad beats Smith outside off, but, as ever, there\u2019s no thin edge \u2013 Smith only deals in thick ones. To prove it, he plays a low squirt, short of the man at a fine gully. A single \u2013 to square leg, inevitably \u2013 takes him level with the highest score in this series, made by... you\u2019ll never guess. 86th over: Australia 317-5 (Smith 143, Paine 36) Whisper it once again: Paine looks great here, slamming Archer through cover for four of the best. That\u2019s his highest score of the series, as the TV commentary reminds me. Archer responds with more short stuff, which isn\u2019t bothering the captain as he hopes it might. Well played. Indeed, well played to you all on the email - sorry I didn\u2019t get to all of them. With drinks on the field this is my cue to hand the OBO baton over to Tim de Lisle. I\u2019ll talk to you again tomorrow morning. Bye! 85th over: Australia 313-5 (Smith 143, Paine 32) Into those ~nervous 140s~ goes Smith. He\u2019s beaten by a good\u2019un from Broad, this time over the wicket, the next ball finding his outside edge and spitting away for a couple. But he gets the chance to work the final ball where he likes it most, into the legside, scampering back for another brace. 84th over: Australia 309-5 (Smith 139, Paine 32) For suggesting this I\u2019m certain that he will now get himself out, but Paine is looking very comfortable against Archer here, clipping a couple then pushing another. Smith gives him the strike back, the captain at ease against the short balls that inevitably arrive. Maybe we\u2019re writing about him tonight? I wouldn\u2019t mind that, just for something different. I\u2019m reminded by Andrew Donnison, the hero of our UAE story last year, that he was taking photos of Leach bowling consistent no-balls from the party stand yesterday. Sloppy, costly cricket. \u201cIs it windy at OT today?\u201d asks Ross Antrobus, an old teammate of mine at the mighty Hampstead Cricket Club. \u201cA question regarding the removal of the bails yesterday, does DRS account for this or could you be given out (via DRS) with the ball clipping a bail that didn\u2019t physically exist at the time? Appreciate this is niche but that\u2019s the kind of guy I am!\u201d Geoff Lemon and I discussed this on our post-game show last night. We definitely think/hope so. We do like talking about bails. 83rd over: Australia 305-5 (Smith 138, Paine 29) Preeeeetty cricket from Smith, timing the pants off a Broad delivery from around the wicket. Paine pulls confidently, along the carpet for a single. With Australia now beyond 300, and both men well set, they are some chance of batting England out of the game by stumps tonight. \u201cIs Smith\u2019s current dominance just payback for the 2010-11 ashes when Cook batted through the entire series without breaking sweat?\u201d asks George Kidd. That\u2019s a good comparison, actually. Remember when Smith was brought into that series because, so it was said, he told good jokes in the rooms? A million years ago. 82nd over: Australia 297-5 (Smith 131, Paine 28) Back to Archer and Smith. Can he go up to his next level with this new ball? Not initially, the main man taking a single to midwicket with a minimum of fuss. Paine sways out the way of one bouncer and ducks another before defending solidly to finish. He\u2019s now faced 70 deliveries himself. \u201cBoa Tarde Adam.\u201d Geoff Wignall, a pleasure as always. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasant and balmy 30\u00b0 here in the Beira after the heat of recent days and as good a place as any to read the thoughts of others about Smith\u2019s likely cricketing longevity. I was reminded by it of Bishen Bedi\u2019s initial assessment of Pietersen - that he\u2019d be finished in Test cricket by his early thirties, once his eyes began to go. (And that he\u2019d be a bunny for a good left arm spinner, or more specifically a younger Bedi. Fancied him c&amp;b off the leading edge. True enough that KP was never comfortable against left arm tweakers.) On longevity - this is Smith\u2019s third Ashes tour to England, due to that nonsense with them playing two in three summers. He\u2019s a decent chance of getting through five by the time he is finished. 81st over: Australia 296-5 (Smith 130, Paine 28) Broad it is, back now at the Statham End, where he has done the vast bulk of his work in this innings. Shane Warne is talking about Tim Paine\u2019s batting, surely only moments away from sacking him live on air. Paine responds with a forceful cut shot, hammering a loose Broad offering. 80th over: Australia 291-5 (Smith 129, Paine 24) Three more singles off what will be Denly\u2019s second and final over for now, all out to the leg side. Smith has now faced 200 balls. England take the new ball. \u201c80 overs into the first innings and thinking a draw would probably be a very good result from here, probably not the best sign really is it?\u201d asks Chris Parker. With rain about tomorrow, that will help if you\u2019re already thinking in those terms. Then again, does anyone believe we\u2019ll get through this Test without at least two collapses? \u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation to Leach, Smitty will soon be into the nervous 140\u2019s,\u201d jokes Yum. Weirdly, that will also be on Smith\u2019s mind. \u201cCan I request that the ICC launch an urgent enquiry into the potential extraterrestrial origins of Steve Smith?\u201d proposes Tom Fairbairn. \u201cIf it transpires he\u2019s a Cricketaloid from the planet Crick, is he still legally allowed to play? In truth, it\u2019s all the more extraordinary that he\u2019s nothing but a mortal man.\u201d 79th over: Australia 288-5 (Smith 127, Paine 23) This will be Leach\u2019s last over for a while, the new ball due from his end next up. Three singles comes from this less penetrative set, out to the sweepers at deep cover and midwicket - like the middle overs of an ODI. Leach walks off the ground at the end of his over, Athers suggesting that he might have taken some skin off his spinning finger. Poor Jack. 78th over: Australia 285-5 (Smith 125, Paine 22) Denly for a few of his leggies with a few overs remaining before the second new ball. Not a bad shout. But Paine isn\u2019t going to take any risks with that milestone within touching distance, defending the lot. A rare maiden. 77th over: Australia 285-5 (Smith 125, Paine 22) Paine takes on Root at mid-off for a single, making his ground comfortably. More good batting from the captain, turning the pressure up on the home side after a poor third hour so far for them. Smith plays the rest of the over respectfully and watchfully. He\u2019s hit the re-set button? 76th over: Australia 284-5 (Smith 125, Paine 21) Smith doing Smith things. He nearly plays Stokes onto his stumps and races around the woodwork to make sure the ball doesn\u2019t deflect down that way. Sure. Stokes oversteps for the second time in two overs - that\u2019s three in three when considering Leach\u2019s desperately costly foot-fault - which allows Smith another look, and he makes no mistake crunching a ropey full-toss to the extra cover boundary. He now has 503 runs in the series at 167.67. If not for the fact that he missed three innings, Bradman\u2019s 974 from 1930 probably would be in range by now. \u201cAfternoon, Adam.\u201d Hi, Phil Sawyer. \u201cFrom a pommie perspective, interesting use of the word \u2018lucky\u2019 there (13.42pm). The more runs Smith scores against us, I\u2019m sure the luckier we all feel.\u201d 75th over: Australia 277-5 (Smith 120, Paine 20) Joe Root brought his team together as Smith walked back from the boundary edge to give them a stern talking to, urging them to stay with the task. Moments like this can be series-defining. \u201cA crazy over,\u201d says Nasser on telly. \u201cThey have Smith, now they don\u2019t have Smith.\u201d What a game. Unbelievable scenes. A beautiful delivery, the spinner celebrates Smith edging to slip. But when the third umpire is asked to check for the no-ball, he is shown to be over the line. Dear me. 74th over: Australia 273-5 (Smith 118, Paine 19) Stokes it into the attack for the first time today and it is a big over, going for xx. Paine gets it started with a graceful on-drive, learning on a half-volley. His best shot so far. Smith\u2019s turn, who takes four of the easiest runs he\u2019s made across these hours in the middle, helping a ball down leg fine of the man at long leg. For his next trick, he elects to play a shot between third slip and gully at a catchable height off the middle of the bat. Silly good. Stokes oversteps but then beats Smith with the next ball. 15 from it. 73rd over: Australia 258-5 (Smith 109, Paine 14) Steve Smith has played his first false stroke since the Mesolithic Age but it has landed between two fielders. Leach, once again, drew the false stroke and much as it was with Wade, the top edge went hiiiigh in the air, but this time it bisected the man running back from cover and the other racing in from deep cover. Paine is looking comfortable against the spin so far, getting back into his crease to cut his second boundary. 72nd over: Australia 252-5 (Smith 108, Paine 9) What. A. Shot. Smith gets deep in the crease and plays the most lavish backfoot drive off Broad. Hooley dooley, that is stunning. Paine is back on strike by the end of the over and cops a beauty from Broad, who can only look down the pitch and lament the fact that it didn\u2019t kiss the edge. \u201cBroad has certainly had more than his fair share of dropped catches off his bowling, but if there are stats available they really ought to name the guilty fielders,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cSome teams have much better cordons than others. Any idea who was the best and why?\u201d I can\u2019t think of a better cordon in my lifetime than Warne, M Waugh, Hayden, Ponting with Steve Waugh in the gully. Any combination. 71st over: Australia 247-5 (Smith 103, Paine 9) Leach to Smith remains an interesting clash - he was definitely the man most likely at him before the break. He gets to the pitch to take one, Paine then returning to his plan of lunging forward at the finger spinner. 70th over: Australia 246-5 (Smith 102, Paine 9) Bad dropped catch! The change of ends brings enough movement for Broad, winning a healthy outside edge from Paine, put down by Roy. They don\u2019t come much more straightforward than that. It was a loose shot; Paine deserved to fall to it. Has a bowler ever had more chances put down off him (especially behind the wicket) than Stuart Broad? It will be Broad resuming, swung around to the Jimmy Anderson End for the first time in this innings, replacing Overton. PLAY! More Smith before we start? Why not. From Robin Hazlehurst. \u201cMy quick and dodgy maths suggests Smith has scored about 40% of the runs in this innings so far, and 37% of the total runs in the other innings he has batted. That sounds like a lot - is it close to historical records? It certainly suggests that England\u2019s best tactic for getting Smith out is don\u2019t bother, and just focus on the guy at the other end.\u201d I\u2019ll throw that open to the stattos. But it has to be right up there? \u201cYou said about Smith that we are basically watching Bradman,\u201d emails David Markham. \u201cOddly, I was looking at an old newspaper today, describing an innings of Bradman in club cricket in Sydney and it talked about him regularly hitting the ball to the square leg boundary off middle stump. Wonder who that reminds me of.\u201d This is what Jim Maxwell points to - the style of play as well as the stats. Either way, we\u2019re obviously very lucky as cricket lovers. Some emails asking which three Smith tons I didn\u2019t see at the ground. They were the first two (The Oval, Perth 2013) and Centurion 2014, which he has since credited as the most important in giving him the confidence to be a legitimate world-beater. Okay, I\u2019m fed. Let\u2019s burst through some corro before the resumption. \u201cTravis Head is a good player but in a series where the Aussies are keen not to lose wickets in clusters it\u2019s weird to have a shaky starter at five,\u201d says Digvijay Yadav. I just hope they don\u2019t do something daft like making him captain this summer if Paine retires. Give him time. \u201cSince Steve Smith\u2019s odd method relies more on a good eye than someone like Virat, is there not a chance that his later career regression might be steeper once his peepers start to go?\u201d asks David Seare. \u201cAlternatively, once The Ashes is the only Test series left he could push towards 80 since we can\u2019t seem to trouble him very much.\u201d This has been (kinda) the argument with Smith in the past, that his technique wouldn\u2019t hold up over the longer term. Echoing the above: I just hope they don\u2019t do something daft like making him the captain in March if Paine retires at the end of the home summer. Let him bat. \u201cI have a question for the knowledgeable, of which I\u2019m sure there are many reading OBO,\u201d begins Martyn Fairbrother. Flattery will indeed get you everywhere/published in the OBO. \u201cWhy do players have their names and numbers on their shirts, but not on their jumpers? I could understand them having these on both or on neither, but to have it on the shirt and then cover it with a jumper just seems daft.\u201d Could it be that there is no neat way to get that pattern on a woolen jumper short of actually knitting it in? \u201cWhich country has more than one current Test player with a current average over 50?\u201d asks Romeo. \u201cThe answer is Afghanistan. After his, and his country\u2019s maiden Test century today against Bangladesh, Rahmat Shah\u2019s average is 58.8. Asghar Afghan is currently on 63.66, and needs just ten more runs tomorrow morning to be over 50 even when he gets out. Worth a salute, I think.\u201d Back in 15. Drop me a line, I\u2019ll be back with your emails soon. 69th over: Australia 245-5 (Smith 101, Paine 9) I\u2019ve been at 23 of the 26 Smith centuries and some have an utter feeling of inevitability about them - this was one of those. I made an error below and said it was nine Ashes tons for him now - it\u2019s 11, of course. One stat from Cricbuzz: it took Tendulkar 136 innings to get to 26 tons, this is Smith\u2019s 121st and all have been in his most recent 99 hits. Tim Paine takes his side to lunch with his best shot so far, driving Leach neatlythrough the covers for four. If not for the fact that Smith is still there, it could be called an even session. But that will count for nothing if he sticks around for another two hours. Remarkable. 68th over: Australia 241-5 (Smith 101, Paine 5) He simply unbelievable. With two around the corner, Smith reaches three figures yet again against England. This is his 11th Ashes century, all brought up since the final Test in 2013 at The Oval. We\u2019ve seen plenty of dominant players in the modern game, but nothing quite like this. 67th over: Australia 233-5 (Smith 98, Paine 4) Inching closer, Smith takes another one to the legside off Leach - he\u2019s worked his way through the 90s almost exclusively in this fashion - Paine stroking one to mid-off to give the strike back. Will he take him on and move to 100 with a four as he did twice in Birmingham? Not this time, happy with a single to cover. Two overs until lunch. Steve Waugh went to lunch on 98 at Old Trafford in 1997, from memory. 66th over: Australia 233-5 (Smith 96, Paine 3) Smith clips one from the first Overton delivery - a boundary away from a ton. He now has 2500 Ashes runs. Paine had to deal with a couple of useful deliveries that decked away from him but managed to avoid edging behind. \u201cHaving studied Smith\u2019s technique for a long time - we\u2019ve had plenty of opportunities - I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve found his weakness,\u201d says Gareth Frith. I\u2019m looking forward to this! \u201cWhen England bowl to him from over the wicket, he\u2019s often forwards, or back, or laterally, he sometimes takes what is referred to as \u2018one run\u2019, and gives us the chance to bowl at his mate instead. Straws clutched.\u201d He\u2019s going to finish this series with a lowest score of 92, isn\u2019t he? Absurd. As Jim Maxwell says, we are basically watching Bradman. 65th over: Australia 232-5 (Smith 95, Paine 3) A single from Smith into the legside off Leach early in the over, Paine then making sure that he\u2019s well forward in defence to blunt the spin. He\u2019s started well. \u201cForgive me if this has been suggested before but why not swap the timetable to have the venues in the north host the Ashes earlier in the series?\u201d writes Ruth Pudue. \u201cThe weather isn\u2019t good up here in September, it\u2019s going to rain, they\u2019re going to lose time.\u201d I was told that this is the first Ashes Test at Old Trafford in September. Of course, this is an unusual summer due to the World Cup. The broader question probably is why both events have been staged in England in the same season? They squeezed in an entire extra Ashes series a few years back to avoid Australia having to do the same in 2015. Oh wait... maybe that was to do with moolah? 64th over: Australia 231-5 (Smith 94, Paine 3) How good does Paine look batting in the long sleeved shirt and sleeveless jumper, by the way? How it is meant to be. Overton is sticking with his short attack from around the wicket to him, the captain ready for it and evading. When the bouncers are used up, he stays still to clip from his armpit down to long leg. Good batting. Smith takes a ball from his stumps to midwicket to keep the strike for Leach. One (big) shot away. 63rd over: Australia 229-5 (Smith 93, Paine 2) Leah is bowling with guile and loop, just what you want at Smith in the 90s. The superstar is twice beaten by that flight, oh-so-close to slicing to backward point then not far away at all from feeding a catch to silly point. Sure enough, he is back on it with one to cover, Paine then doing likewise. 62nd over: Australia 227-5 (Smith 92, Paine 1) Overton is around the wicket bumping Smith to begin, who wants none of it. He gets off strike with a well-timed tuck, Paine off the mark later in the over with a risk-free pull shot. Smith keeps the strike and moves to 92, the score he made at Lord\u2019s; his lowest of the series. Extraordinary. 61st over: Australia 224-5 (Smith 90, Paine 0) Well bowled Jack Leach, giving Wade the chance to dance as he had before the rain delay. A crafty bowler. As Ricky Ponting notes, Wade likes to score and wasn\u2019t picking up runs with the ease he would have liked when defending the seamers from the Pavilion End. Wade dances at Leach but miscues badly, the top edge swirling high in the air, taken safely by the captain Root. After all that hard work. 60th over: Australia 221-4 (Smith 87, Wade 16) There isn\u2019t much going on from Overton\u2019s end, Wade defending him. confidently. 59th over: Australia 220-4 (Smith 87, Wade 16) A mix-up! Smith bunts and runs into the legside, Wade sending him back with a roar. Absolutely the right decision - there was no run there. That\u2019s the advantage of having a senior player with Smith. He\u2019s right back on it next ball, taking full advantage of a delivery on the leg stump from Leach, taking him through midwicket for four. Shot. Leach bounces straight back though, beating him on the outside edge with a delivery that really dips and grips. Smith acknowledges that it is a very good bit of bowling. Smith moves to 87 with one to cover. Some mythbusting about that number: when in the 80s, Australians have been dismissed more often on every score other than 87. 58th over: Australia 215-4 (Smith 82, Wade 16) Overton goes bouncer, bouncer to begin - a touch odd to use them both to start an over. Smith is across this, standing tall at the crease to flick the next ball to deep backward square for one. Wade blocks out the rest without concern. He\u2019s 16 from 39 balls. The players are back on the field. No news on whether the playing times for the day have been adjusted - I suspect they will be. \u201cHas Woakes been dropped or finally been rested from an undisclosed injury?\u201d asks Ian James. Rested, is the word. But there\u2019s also a whisper of a knee niggle. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure out why he bowled so little at Lord\u2019s and Headingley. Lord\u2019s (we were told) was a utopian-type home ground for him and he barley got a look in. At Leeds, Stokes toiled away for over after over and no Woakes.\u201d My best guess is the captain wanted Archer every moment he could at Lord\u2019s and Stokes was doing a real shift at Leeds after Woakes battled on the first day. Either way, he\u2019ll be back soon enough. Overton will bowl the first over back. Smith is on strike. Some emails? Let\u2019s. From Matthew Doherty, to begin. \u201cThis Test is beginning to remind me of the one here in 1985,\u201d he says. \u201cMike Gatting 160; Craig McDermott eight of the available wickets.\u201d Did anyone else enjoy that 1980s Ashes doco during the rain on Sky Cricket yesterday? They do good work. \u201cHere\u2019s a deal,\u201d suggests Edward Genochio, \u201ccall it It a cricketing version of baseball\u2019s intentional walk. Smith doesn\u2019t get to bat. We give him 100 runs (out) automatically in every innings, and we\u2019ll just bowl at the rest of you. Putting the laws of cricket aside for the time being: would England make the offer? Would the Aussies accept?\u201d I\u2019ve been thinking a bit about Smith and his batting average. Could it finish... in the 70s? Since his breakthrough century at The Oval in August 2013, he goes at 73 across those 99 innings. Crazy. 57th over: Australia 214-4 (Smith 81, Wade 16) It\u2019s very dark all of a sudden at Old Trafford, I am afraid to say. We\u2019ll see. Fow now, it is Jack Leach for the first time today and there\u2019s plenty going on right away, Wade nearly gloving a sweep to keep the fielders around the bat on their toes. The left-hander responds by dancing down the track, clipping with class through the air for a two-bounce four. Oh, it\u2019s raining. And they\u2019re off. Here come the covers. Urrrrrrgh. 56th over: Australia 209-4 (Smith 80, Wade 12) Huge appeal for caught behind! Archer seems certain that he has won Wade\u2019s edge on the hook, landing in Bairstow\u2019s gloves. Umpire Erasmus turns the shout down and rightly so: the replay confirms there\u2019s nothing on it. Root keeps his cool and doesn\u2019t review. Earlier, Wade brought up the Australian 200 with another well-controlled steer, past backward point and down to the rope. As Isa Guha says on telly, these two put on a 100-run stand at Edgbaston that put the First Test out of England\u2019s reach. After the appeal the final ball is sprayed, clipping Wade\u2019s pad and running away for four leg byes. Poor response. 55th over: Australia 199-4 (Smith 79, Wade 8) Another probing Broad over - this is an excellent spell. Has he ever bowled better across a full series? But Wade is up to the task, getting on the front foot to push with control for a couple past cover then edging with soft hands on the bounce into the cordon. \u201cGood luck for today\u2019s play.\u201d Thanks, James Wrout. \u201cThe photo at the top of the page has a caption at the moment which says \u201cSteve Smith sweeps a beach ball at Old Trafford\u201d. Surely it should say: \u201cThe game of cricket, as seen through the eyes of Steve Smith\u201d!\u201d I reckon Felix White summed it up best on twitter last night. 54th over: Australia 197-4 (Smith 79, Wade 6) Nice and calm, Wade gets through an accurate Archer over without any concern. He\u2019ll be on strike for Broad next, advancing the score by one with a leg bye. 53rd over: Australia 196-4 (Smith 79, Wade 6) Aside from the whack to the arm, Wade had looked pretty organised so far. It isn\u2019t a stretch to say that this could be his final Test Match unless he makes a big contribution - he\u2019s been around long enough to realise that. He gets off strike with a controlled push to point. Smith pulls a similar delivery to the one he left a couple of overs back, not at all middling it, but landing safely behind square for a couple. He ducks, defends and waves his wand when shouldering arms to complete the set. Might this be the day they leave Broad on for a really long spell? \u201cMorning Collo.\u201d Nick Toovey, my man. \u201cCan\u2019t help but view Steve Smith as somebody that\u2019s now been conditioned by the Dog-Stick commonly used to hurl balls at batsman into a cricketing cocker spaniel. His excitement at having balls hurled towards him never wanes, and like any dog owner will testify, the people hurling the balls are getting bored, tired and cranky well before he does.\u201d Talking to a member of the Australian camp a few weeks ago, he explained that Smith doesn\u2019t mind batting three (as he does periodically) on the basis that an opener might get out first ball, which allows him to go in straight away. This is how his brain works. 52nd over: Australia 193-4 (Smith 77, Wade 5) Good batting from Smith, getting on the back foot early to Archer, able to steer him behind point for his third boundary of the morning. There are three bouncers either side of the stroke, all dealt with relatively easily by Smith. The extra yard he had at Lord\u2019s isn\u2019t quite there. Yet. 51st over: Australia 188-4 (Smith 73, Wade 4) Oooh, Broad is all over it here to Wade, drawing the left-hander forward from the around the wicket as he has done time and again in this series, beating the edge. As CricViz reported yesterday, he\u2019s sent down 37 per cent of his deliveries on a full length in this series, more than ever before for him. Wade keeps his cool, glancing a ball from his middle stump to leave the last ball to Smith, leaving a bouncer he briefly considered having a flash at before realising it wasn\u2019t a good idea. \u201cWhilst we grapple with one particular batsman and how to dismiss him,\u201d says Andrew Benzeval, \u201cI note that over in Chittagong Rahmat Shah has scored Afghanistan\u2019s maiden Test hundred. Well done that man.\u201d Go you good thing go! He joins a pretty handy list. We interviewed the great Aminul \u2018BulBul\u2019 Islam during the World Cup for our 1999 retrospective project, the man who did it first for Bangladesh. 50th over: Australia 186-4 (Smith 72, Wade 3) Ouch! Archer stings Wade with a ball that he can\u2019t get out the way of, smacking him on the unprotected top arm. Sure enough, he finds an edge next ball, albeit one that doesn\u2019t quite carry to first slip. \u201cYou would normally expect that to carry every day of the week here,\u201d notes Mike Atherton on the telly, who knows a thing or two about Old Trafford. \u201cSeems to me one of the things that makes a batsman great is that they eliminate certain aspects of their game,\u201d writes Peter Salmon. \u201cRicky Ponting eliminated the cut shot, Steve Waugh the hook. Smith has simply taken this to its logical conclusion and eliminated getting out. So simple, and yet astonishing no one has thought of it before.\u201d 49th over: Australia 184-4 (Smith 72, Wade 1) Looking back at the Head replay, it was hitting leg stump but not flush. Boy, how Australia need Wade at his best today. I interviewed him a couple of days ago and he talked about how important his last two seasons in Hobart have been to re-training himself to bat on English-style pitches. He\u2019s off the mark second ball, taking a single to mid-on. From around the wicket, Broad has slipped past Head\u2019s inside edge. There\u2019s no doubt where that is going and no review required. 48th over: Australia 181-3 (Smith 71, Head 18) Here it is, Archer\u2019s quicker bumper at Smith, waiting until the last moment before swaying out of the way. That\u2019s exactly what Justin Langer talked about before the Test. He\u2019s forced to use his bat for the majority of the over, the radar hit at 90mph for the first time in this Test Match along the way. He leaves a temper to finish. Good contest. Here is the overseas TMS link, from the same place it always is. 47th over: Australia 181-3 (Smith 71, Head 18) Smith wants to pull Broad\u2019s first ball but doesn\u2019t get enough of it to turn the board over. He leaves the two short balls that follow, defending and dancing the delivery aimed straight. He keeps the strike with a flick to finish. 46th over: Australia 180-3 (Smith 70, Head 18) Archer is beginning the day from the Anderson End and this strange start to the morning continues. Smith is on top to begin, on the back foot crunching the England quick through cover to move to 66 - his average will improve in this innings. But forget about that, Archer drops him next ball in his follow through. It\u2019s from a low full toss, about thigh height to his right, the chance fumbled. As every commentator will note, they\u2019re never easy for the fast bowlers, but even so, the replay suggests he should have taken that. After the two consecutive boundaries, Archer finds the inside edge - once again, not far away from strife there. Head\u2019s turn to finish, facing his first ball of the day, and he\u2019s beaten by a good\u2019un outside the off-stump. 45th over: Australia 171-3 (Smith 61, Head 18) Edge first ball! Broad has Smith pushing and nicking, albeit on the bounce to the cordon. He plays and misses at the next. Unusually nervy from the former captain. After getting bat on ball to defend the third, he\u2019s into his full carry on, \u201cwait there!\u201d he roars, turning 180 degrees for reasons best explained by him. Now... a delay. What is going on here? Smith has seen something behind Broad he doesn\u2019t like. Umpire Dharmasena runs off the field to get a... door shut at long-off? But he\u2019s still not happy. Smith can see through the crack of the door a reflection off the Sky Cricket truck in the car park. You couldn\u2019t make it up. Relaxed at last, a bumper follows - quite right - before Smith keeps the strike from the final ball of this eventful over, tucking square. Thanks, JP! Morning all. And what a lovely Manchester morning this is. Stuart Broad has the ball in his hand, he\u2019ll be running away from me at the Brian Statham (or Broadcast) End. Steve Smith is on strike, resuming his innings on 60 - still three runs short of his average in Test cricket, would you believe. Let\u2019s do it. PLAY! Righto, I can see cricket on the horizon which means Adam Collins must be around here somewhere. Please redirect emails to adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com and tweets to @collinsadam. I like Marnus Labuschagne. He talks in plain English, cuts through the noise and tries to answer questions directly. He\u2019s just given a nice interview to Ian Healy on Australian TV, in part discussing what it\u2019s like being at the non-striker\u2019s end while Steve Smith bats. \u201cThey just don\u2019t look like they\u2019re ever going to get him out,\u201d he says matter of factly. \u201cOne unintended consequence of Stokes\u2019s onslaught at Headingley might play through later in this Test,\u201d begins Ian Forth. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to imagine a scenario where Australia are, say, 380 runs ahead with 5 wickets in hand at the end of Day 4 - but still feel reluctant to declare, lest new records are smashed on the last day. Then, just possibly, England could escape with a draw 8 wickets down with The Ashes still alive going into The Oval.\u201d David Murray is one of many who can\u2019t understand why Chris Woakes was sacrificed for this Test. \u201cReplacing Woakes, one of our most reliable performers with bat and ball over the last few years, with the relatively untested Overton makes no sense to me, nor does Root\u2019s under-use of Woakes when he was in the team. I would much rather have seen one of the batsmen dropped and Rashid brought in, or perhaps Curran. Someone who might offer something different and take wickets.\u201d This email arrived just as I was considering sharing this piece of CricViz analysis: I wonder if it reinforces the decision not to pick Woakes (i.e. there was no swing on offer therefore a specialist swing bowler would have been redundant), or if it amplifies the wrongness of his dropping. Who\u2019d be a selector? Big day for Jack Leach, you\u2019d reckon. Surely he\u2019s pencilled in for 40 overs at no more than 2.5 rpo to allow the quicks to steam in for short bursts. Robin Hazlehurst has emailed in some astute observations. \u201cEngland\u2019s failure to remove Steve Smith on a good batting track on a difficult day for bowling is not good, but the bigger worry is still England\u2019s batting. A score of 400 in the first innings of a Test happens, it just means the team batting second has to dig in and pile up the big runs. But is anyone currently feeling optimistic that England can or will do that? And does that doubt undermine the bowlers if they feel under more pressure to perform if they can\u2019t trust the batting?\u201d Geoff Lemon has taken a look at David Warner\u2019s unflattering series statistics. The slump has been a surprise. Warner was one run away from topping the World Cup list in England only a few weeks ago, racking up 647 with three centuries. He even played his one-day cricket in what felt closer to his Test match mode, taking his time to build big innings. He seemed set for a substantial Ashes. There is no way to quantify whether the difference has been in fields or in bowlers or in facing the red Dukes ball versus the white Kookaburra; or whether it is something less technical, less tangible, like the lasting scrutiny of an Ashes series settling in the way that a manic global tournament might not. It\u2019s always a pleasure when Ian Forth logs on. \u201cYour \u2018Day Today\u2019 reference of \u2018if need be\u2019 highlights one of the charming old rivers which run underground in English syntax,\u201d he emails. \u201cHere we catch a glimpse of the subjunctive in a conditional protasis shyly rising its timorous head above the narrative parapet.\u201d I will take your word for it. Although, if we\u2019re competing for Pseuds Corner, your email did evoke memories of Rising Damp, a wonderful poem by Ursula Fanthorpe. The build-up to the fourth Test was dominated by anticipation of the duel resuming between Jofra Archer and Steve Smith, but as Barney Ronay reports the spectacle underwhelmed. We came for Archer v Smith, part two. What we got was a slow-paced pitch and something more faithful to the rhythms of this insistently slow-burn form; not to mention more in keeping with Smith\u2019s own status as a great of the game. On the topic of bowling, Adam Giles was unimpressed with Overton and co. \u201cI must admit, England looked lacklustre with the ball yesterday,\u201d he emails, not inaccurately. \u201cThey seem to have no clear plans or new ideas. Rather than hold a line outside off with the occasional variation to try take a wicket, there just seems to be a \u201crun up and bowl\u201d culture. As boring as it would be, I\u2019d happily see 10 consecutive overs of 5th-stump leaves from the batsmen rather than the spray currently being produced.\u201d While largely in agreement, I think yesterday\u2019s showing highlighted how well both sides have bowled so far this series. Craig Overton was on media duties for England last night and Ali Martin was around to hear the recalled paceman explain how tough the conditions were on day one. Conditions really didn\u2019t suit running into bowl. It\u2019s just the rhythm of the run-up \u2013 you feel like you\u2019re getting to the crease and all of a sudden the wind hits you and it pushes you forward. Further proof, if proof be need be, that it is a lovely morning in Manchester. Also, a reminder to me of that time I met Neil Fairbrother sometime in the mid-90s when I was a kid and you could watch a game at Old Trafford from the car park through the gaps in the stands. Harvey was wearing memorably excellent squash shoes. Miss any of yesterday\u2019s action? Fear not, because Vic Marks braved the wind and the rain to bring you this report from day one at Old Trafford. Australia won a good toss and after 44 overs had advanced to 170 for three, having been reduced to 28 for two in the first half\u2011hour. That was a most satisfactory outcome for Tim Paine\u2019s side. Even better for the tourists was the sight of Steve Smith back in harness, batting just as he did in the first Test at Edgbaston. The weather. The good news is it\u2019s dry in Manchester and the forecast indicates we should (touching wood with a lucky rabbit\u2019s foot lodged between crossed fingers) remain rain-free all day. The possibility of any interruption is highest during the afternoon session. The bad news is it\u2019s decidedly chilly. The forecast top temperature is 14C with everything kept on the fresh side of that maximum by a westerly breeze. Chris Raybould has the honour of sending in the first email of the day. It takes an unexpected turn. \u201cSitting here in Australia and wondering whether England might have had their two big games of the summer,\u201d he writes. \u201cI desperately want them to wrestle the Ashes back but as good as he is, Stokesy isn\u2019t a one man team. What was it my mum used to say? Something about it\u2019s better to have a champion team than a team of champions? Clones\u2026 maybe cloning is the way?\u201d The day two pitch looks flat and full of runs. Composing a strategy to winkle out Steve Smith on a surface like this would drive any captain to distraction. Also, a nice reminder in the tweet below that because of the overs lost to rain today\u2019s play is scheduled to last 30 minutes longer than usual. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of day two of the fourth Test from Old Trafford. Day one went decisively Australia\u2019s way. Tim Paine won a good toss before Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith neutralised any momentum England might have been carrying into the match following Ben Stokes\u2019s heroics at Headingley. Only 44 overs were possible and with further rain delays likely over the next couple of days, it may prove difficult for either side to force a positive result on a surface that has so far proven the easiest to bat on this series. With runs on the board and England batting last on a pitch expected to break up and facilitate spin, Australia are in the box seat. For the hosts to assert themselves on the contest the opening hour of play will be vital. There will be plenty of scrutiny on Jofra Archer during the early exchanges. The emerging star underwhelmed for the first time in his international career yesterday, bowling without intent for portions, reflecting a general demeanour that suggested he did not relish his time in the field on such a wintry day. Joe Root must demand more from his spearhead. If you don\u2019t know the drill by now, I am holding the fort for the next hour or so until play begins but once the action gets underway I\u2019ll hand you over to Adam Collins at Old Trafford. If you want to join in before play, starting at 11am BST, you can find me on Twitter or you can send me an email.",

Prorogation also prevents parliament from performing its other scrutiny functions.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prime minister is entitled to decide to end a session of parliament, Pannick said. \u201cWe say that what the prime minister is not entitled to do is to close down parliament for five weeks at such a critical period without justification and when a five-week prorogation is simply not required for the purposes of a Queen\u2019s speech.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f0e90d223a0e72c3c880aefad25dea9a8f05e124\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0e90d223a0e72c3c880aefad25dea9a8f05e124/0_80_2625_3281/800.jpg\" alt=\"Another redacted page from the released documents\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another redacted page from the released documents.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Conor Riordan/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In written submissions, Sir James Eadie QC, representing Johnson, said prorogation was not a matter for the courts to decide.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are no judicial or manageable standards by reference to which the courts could assess the lawfulness of ministerial advice to prorogue parliament or prorogation itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe exercise of this prerogative power is intrinsically one of high policy and politics, not law.</p> \n<p>\u201cMoreover, the frequency of sitting of parliament and the advice tendered to Her Majesty are governed by constitutional convention and not legal rules.

The government would be attacked for this decision but it would be manageable.\u201d The cabinet document also reveals that talks with Brussels were not making much headway despite what was being said in public: \u201cThe prime minister said that progress with the EU should not be exaggerated, whilst there was a good chance that a deal could be secured, there was also a high chance that it could not. Success would require a united and determined approach.\u201d Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, and Nikki da Costa, the prime minister\u2019s senior legal adviser, had been asked to confirm their reasons for the prorogation under oath in statements for the Scottish legal action. Joanna Cherry, the Scottish National party MP who is the lead litigant in the Scottish case, raised this with Michael Gove, the de facto deputy prime minister, in a Commons committee hearing on Thursday. Cherry asked Gove whether Sedwill and Da Costa were scared of perjuring themselves or simply did not want to reveal the true reasons for prorogation. Gove replied: \u201cI have absolutely no idea.\u201d The high court in London is hoping to give judgment on Friday morning after hearing evidence that Johnson\u2019s decision to shut down parliament at a time of intense political upheaval is an \u201cunlawful abuse of power\u201d. Whichever way the court\u2019s decision goes, a series of similar legal challenges from Belfast, Edinburgh and London are expected to be joined together at the supreme court on 17 September so that the UK\u2019s most senior judges can resolve whether or not it can be overturned. At the high court on Thursday, three of the most senior judges in England and Wales \u2013 the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and the president of the Queen\u2019s bench division, Dame Victoria Sharp \u2013 heard arguments about the powers used to prorogue or suspend parliament at the end of a session. Lord Pannick QC, who represents the legal campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller, is challenging Johnson\u2019s announcement that parliament should be suspended from next week until 14 October. The prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen to prorogue the session showed that he regarded parliamentas an irrelevance, Pannick said. Prorogation has never lasted longer than three weeks in the past 40 years and in most casesonly a week or less, Pannick said. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s decision is an unlawful abuse of power,\u201d he said. \u201cIt breaches the legal principle of parliamentary sovereignty because the effect of prorogation is to remove the ability of parliament to enact such legislation as it sees fit. Prorogation also prevents parliament from performing its other scrutiny functions.\u201d The prime minister is entitled to decide to end a session of parliament, Pannick said. \u201cWe say that what the prime minister is not entitled to do is to close down parliament for five weeks at such a critical period without justification and when a five-week prorogation is simply not required for the purposes of a Queen\u2019s speech. In written submissions, Sir James Eadie QC, representing Johnson, said prorogation was not a matter for the courts to decide. \u201cThere are no judicial or manageable standards by reference to which the courts could assess the lawfulness of ministerial advice to prorogue parliament or prorogation itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe exercise of this prerogative power is intrinsically one of high policy and politics, not law. \u201cMoreover, the frequency of sitting of parliament and the advice tendered to Her Majesty are governed by constitutional convention and not legal rules. It is well settled that the courts do not enforce constitutional conventions which rest on a constitutional and political balance.\u201d Miller\u2019s application is supported by statements from the former prime minister Sir John Major, the shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, and lawyers for the Scottish and Welsh governments. They will be given to the court. Lord Garnier QC, representing Major, said in a written submission that his client believed it was \u201cunlawful to exercise the power of prorogation if the purpose of doing so is to obstruct parliament from enacting legislation with which the prime minister disagrees\u201d. Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, sitting in Edinburgh with Lord Drummond Young and Lord Brodie, heard an appeal by lawyers for 75 MPs and peers against a decision by Lord Doherty on Wednesday to reject their claim that Johnson had prorogued parliament illegally. The Edinburgh appeal is due to continue to Friday, when Carloway will rule on an application for an emergency interdict or injunction to suspend prorogation until the courts can issue a final ruling. Carloway indicated the appeal decision may not be issued until Tuesday, the day when prorogation could come into force.",

But Major will encourage the prime minister to invite those he effectively sacked back into the party. \u201cReinstate those members of parliament you have expelled because, without them \u2013 and others like them \u2013 we will cease to be a broad-based national party, and be seen as a mean-minded sect,\u201d he will say. In recent statements Major, a committed remainer, supported legal campaigner Gina Miller in her high court challenge earlier on Thursday to thwart the suspension of parliament. In a previous attack on Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament, Major described it as \u201cutterly, utterly and completely the wrong way to proceed\u201d. While he will renew his warnings of the \u201cpernicious effects\u201d Brexit could have on the future of the nation, Major will also use the speech to warn of the possible consequences if Scotland were to seek independence from the UK. \u201cThe English nationalists affect not to care about separation. They care more about leaving Europe. But the collapse of unionism in England, and ambition for independence in Scotland, could lead to a calamitous outcome for us both,\u201d he will say.",

Both teams have had busy summers in the transfer market, with United\u2019s business particularly important before their first season in the top flight. Their most eye-catching signings have been the Dutch midfielder Jackie Groenen, a top player who attracted a lot of interest from clubs across Europe, and the defender Abbie McManus from City. They were two strong statements, and though I\u2019m not sure they can put up a genuine challenge for a place in the top three, with their improved squad they will fancy their chances of taking points off anyone.

      "bodyText": "The Women\u2019s Super League starts this weekend in explosive style, with a Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium, a London derby at Stamford Bridge and clear ambition to carry on the momentum from the World Cup. Scheduling big games in big stadiums shows it is not just words \u2013 everything is being put in place to help the domestic game capitalise on the extraordinary interest attracted over the summer. The FA Player, which will broadcast every game of the WSL season for free, and deals to show matches on TV in Mexico and Scandinavia, show a more professional, commercial outlook which should help women\u2019s football in the UK progress even further in the coming years. With men\u2019s football on an international break, there should be plenty of attention on the season\u2019s first games on Saturday afternoon, including the match between Manchester City and a newly promoted Manchester United. Both teams have had busy summers in the transfer market, with United\u2019s business particularly important before their first season in the top flight. Their most eye-catching signings have been the Dutch midfielder Jackie Groenen, a top player who attracted a lot of interest from clubs across Europe, and the defender Abbie McManus from City. They were two strong statements, and though I\u2019m not sure they can put up a genuine challenge for a place in the top three, with their improved squad they will fancy their chances of taking points off anyone. City meanwhile have bolstered their forward line with the England striker Ellen White, after her amazing World Cup, and Lee Geum-min. The Korean is not a player I know well, but she has plenty of international experience and in their recent past City have rarely signed players from outside the EU so Lee\u2019s arrival suggests they feel she can add real value.

However, according to legal academics, this is a misrepresentation of the legal process.</p> <p>Priya and Nades arrived separately in 2012 and 2013, and were assessed separately.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/05/biloela-tamil-family-our-daughters-are-scared-on-christmas-island-mother-says\">Biloela Tamil family: our daughters are scared on Christmas Island, mother says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nades had already been refused protection and so was not eligible to apply for a safe haven entry visa (Shev), which gives temporary protection for three or five years, along with Priya in 2016. Their daughter Kopika was included in the claim.</p> <p>Priya\u2019s claim was also rejected, and the rejection was upheld by the automatic review body \u2013 the Immigration Assessment Authority (IAA) \u2013 as well in appeals to the federal circuit court and the federal court, and in May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/14/biloelas-tamil-family-lose-high-court-bid-to-avoid-deportation\">the high court refused to hear their asylum case</a>.</p> <p>The IAA accepted Priya\u2019s account of her family\u2019s history of discrimination and harm in Sri Lanka before they fled to India in 2001, but didn\u2019t accept that Nades had links to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam which would be of concern to Sri Lankan authorities. It noted he had returned three times between 2004 and 2010, and was able to pass through airport security each time.</p> <p>Priya\u2019s lawyers argued that in order to fully understand her case the department had to further assess Nades\u2019s claims beyond 2011 when they said Sri Lankan authorities showed increased \u201cinterest\u201d in him, but the IAA and courts disagreed.</p> <p>Research by academics and the UTS faculty of law, found the IAA refused to find a person to be a refugee in about 87% of cases.</p> <p>Comparatively, the Refugee Review Tribunal, which heard appeals against departmental rejections until 2015, upheld those refusals in about 65-70% of cases.</p> <p>\u201cThe IAA is a separate and inferior decision-making process and the high rates of rejection are concerning, as they show more of a willingness to affirm the initial decision of the department, rather than allow for robust review,\u201d the UTS lecturer Sarah Dehm said.</p> <p>Non-fast-track cases now go through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which would invite someone in for a new interview when questions about credibility could be reassessed, and no country information introduced, Dehm said.</p> <p>Thousands of unsuccessful asylum seekers appeal their cases through the courts, but those appeals rarely re-examine protection claims or hear new evidence. Many instead argue on the grounds of procedural fairness or judicial review.</p> <p>Legal academics have pointed to the earlier stages of Priya and Kopika\u2019s assessments, in particular their fast-track status and alleged interpretation issues, and raised concerns of fairness.</p> <h2><strong>Fast-track status</strong></h2> <p>\u201cFast track assessment and removal\u201d was introduced in 2014, originally applying to boat arrivals between August 2012 and January 2014, and granting only temporary protection.</p> <p>The IAA was established to hear fast-track cases, and is largely prohibited from considering new evidence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/04/biloela-tamil-family-deportation-case-the-truth-behind-the-claims\">Biloela Tamil family deportation case: the truth behind the claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDespite the \u2018fast track\u2019 name, it took nearly three years before people in this cohort were allowed to apply for protection,\u201d wrote Jane McAdam and Fiona Chong, in their 2019 book Refugee Rights and Policy Wrongs.</p> <p>McAdam and Chong said the process actually increased the risk of refoulement.</p> <p>Peter Billing, a University of Queensland law lecturer, described it as an \u201carguably flawed\u201d process, \u201coffering an unconventional and limited form of review that prioritises speed over fairness\u201d.</p> <h2>The departmental interview</h2> <p>Priya, sitting in the Anglicare office in Biloela, was eight months pregnant when she was interviewed by the department over the phone in February 2017.</p> <p>The previous day she had been in hospital with a migraine. Connections in the three-way call (Priya, her migration agent and the department) dropped out.</p> <p>According to the federal circuit court judgment, three days after her appeal to the IAA was refused in mid-2017, a case worker requested a transcript from the IAA, suggesting \u201cinaccurate information\u201d had been related by the interpreter during the interview \u201cwhich formed the foundation of the refusal\u201d.</p> <p>It submitted an extract of the interview transcript:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>[Delegate]: Right, okay, and when did your family decide to go to India?</em></p> <p><em>[Priya]: February \u2013 we came to India in 2001, February 16.</em></p> <p><em>[Delegate]: Right, okay.

      "bodyText": "Legal experts have raised concerns over the \u201cinferior\u201d fast-track refugee assessment process which saw members of the Tamil family from Biloela refused protection. Sri Lankans Priya, Nades and their two daughters, Kopika and Tharunicaa, are currently in the Christmas Island detention centre, awaiting Friday\u2019s court hearing on an injunction against the federal government\u2019s attempts to deport them. In public comments on the case it has been repeatedly noted that the family have been found not to be refugees, and that Australian courts have held that. However, according to legal academics, this is a misrepresentation of the legal process. Priya and Nades arrived separately in 2012 and 2013, and were assessed separately. Nades had already been refused protection and so was not eligible to apply for a safe haven entry visa (Shev), which gives temporary protection for three or five years, along with Priya in 2016. Their daughter Kopika was included in the claim. Priya\u2019s claim was also rejected, and the rejection was upheld by the automatic review body \u2013 the Immigration Assessment Authority (IAA) \u2013 as well in appeals to the federal circuit court and the federal court, and in May the high court refused to hear their asylum case. The IAA accepted Priya\u2019s account of her family\u2019s history of discrimination and harm in Sri Lanka before they fled to India in 2001, but didn\u2019t accept that Nades had links to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam which would be of concern to Sri Lankan authorities. It noted he had returned three times between 2004 and 2010, and was able to pass through airport security each time. Priya\u2019s lawyers argued that in order to fully understand her case the department had to further assess Nades\u2019s claims beyond 2011 when they said Sri Lankan authorities showed increased \u201cinterest\u201d in him, but the IAA and courts disagreed. Research by academics and the UTS faculty of law, found the IAA refused to find a person to be a refugee in about 87% of cases. Comparatively, the Refugee Review Tribunal, which heard appeals against departmental rejections until 2015, upheld those refusals in about 65-70% of cases. \u201cThe IAA is a separate and inferior decision-making process and the high rates of rejection are concerning, as they show more of a willingness to affirm the initial decision of the department, rather than allow for robust review,\u201d the UTS lecturer Sarah Dehm said. Non-fast-track cases now go through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which would invite someone in for a new interview when questions about credibility could be reassessed, and no country information introduced, Dehm said. Thousands of unsuccessful asylum seekers appeal their cases through the courts, but those appeals rarely re-examine protection claims or hear new evidence. Many instead argue on the grounds of procedural fairness or judicial review. Legal academics have pointed to the earlier stages of Priya and Kopika\u2019s assessments, in particular their fast-track status and alleged interpretation issues, and raised concerns of fairness. Fast-track status \u201cFast track assessment and removal\u201d was introduced in 2014, originally applying to boat arrivals between August 2012 and January 2014, and granting only temporary protection. The IAA was established to hear fast-track cases, and is largely prohibited from considering new evidence. \u201cDespite the \u2018fast track\u2019 name, it took nearly three years before people in this cohort were allowed to apply for protection,\u201d wrote Jane McAdam and Fiona Chong, in their 2019 book Refugee Rights and Policy Wrongs. McAdam and Chong said the process actually increased the risk of refoulement. Peter Billing, a University of Queensland law lecturer, described it as an \u201carguably flawed\u201d process, \u201coffering an unconventional and limited form of review that prioritises speed over fairness\u201d. The departmental interview Priya, sitting in the Anglicare office in Biloela, was eight months pregnant when she was interviewed by the department over the phone in February 2017. The previous day she had been in hospital with a migraine. Connections in the three-way call (Priya, her migration agent and the department) dropped out. According to the federal circuit court judgment, three days after her appeal to the IAA was refused in mid-2017, a case worker requested a transcript from the IAA, suggesting \u201cinaccurate information\u201d had been related by the interpreter during the interview \u201cwhich formed the foundation of the refusal\u201d. It submitted an extract of the interview transcript: [Delegate]: Right, okay, and when did your family decide to go to India? [Priya]: February \u2013 we came to India in 2001, February 16. [Delegate]: Right, okay. Nick, are you there? I have a feeling that your representative has dropped out. Do you want me to try and contact him again? [Priya]: Okay. [Delegate]: Okay, just hold \u2013 I\u2019m just going to ask him if I need to connect with him if it drops out again. I don\u2019t know (indistinct) why it would have dropped out. (Temporary sound interruption) [Migration Agent]: So it dropped out just at the point where you were saying, \u201cWhat do you mean, torture?\u201d Then I didn\u2019t hear any more after that. [Delegate]: Right, well, we can repeat the whole interview if you like. [Migration Agent]: Rather not. [Delegate]: Right, okay, so I believe she said that they were being questioned and beaten up about her brother. That was the response. I\u2019ll just check again. So when you said that you were tortured, what did you mean? [Priya]: Yes, so they beat us, they speak to us in bad language and treat us in bad way. The government\u2019s lawyers argued Priya hadn\u2019t dropped out of the call and the interviewer could hear her. While the migration agent did drop out, they also refused to \u201ctake up the opportunity\u201d to conduct the interview again. Priya\u2019s lawyers also argued she didn\u2019t fully understand the interpreter and didn\u2019t know if he fully understood her. \u201cAt the time of my interview with Department of Immigration and Border Control workers, I was eight months pregnant, with medical issues which were impacting on my personal wellbeing,\u201d Priya wrote to a caseworker some time after. \u201cI was also suffering from migraine and had taken the required medication in aid of this. Because of my state I don\u2019t believe that information was fully understood.\u201d The federal court found it was clear the interviewer had heard everything, including bits which weren\u2019t recorded. Priya was more than 160 days late in lodging an appeal to the federal circuit court, but in asking for an extension her lawyers noted Priya had given birth to Tharunicaa shortly before the IAA gave its decision. She wasn\u2019t able to get legal advice or put in the application, they said, also arguing that Biloela was \u201cremote\u201d and with limited access to lawyers. The federal court judge took into account the recent birth, but rejected their other arguments. \u201cA lot hangs on that one interview with the departmental official, and whether he found her story credible or plausible,\u201d Dehm said. \u201cThey really have one shot to put forward their case for asylum.\u201d The family\u2019s case now hinges on the federal court\u2019s ruling on whether Tharunicaa\u2019s asylum claim can be assessed.",

In less than a day, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson rushed to clarify that this did not mean new legislation would be proposed. Instead Johnson would maintain the EU Settlement Scheme.</p> <p>As campaigners have pointed out, the current scheme implies that migrants who fail to apply will lose their legal status and residency rights. Figures suggest at least 2 million EU nationals have not applied for settled status yet. In order to be given settled status, migrants have to prove they have lived in the UK for at least five years.</p> <p>To make matters worse, the Home Office has brought forward the deadline for applications from 30 June 2021 to 31 December 2020. This is the perfect recipe for a repetition of the Windrush generation scandal.</p> <p>Islamophobic and racist comments by Johnson and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/09/boris-johnson-slated-for-congratulating-viktor-orban-after-election-win\" title=\"\">support for </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/09/boris-johnson-slated-for-congratulating-viktor-orban-after-election-win\" title=\"\">leaders such as Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a> suggest that the likelihood of racist attacks on migrant rights is high, as does Johnson\u2019s commitment to a points-based immigration system.</p> <p>Legislation should be passed to guarantee the legal status of all EU migrants who live here. At a minimum the government must: scrap the five-year cap \u2013 every EU national resident in the UK should preserve all their current rights; re-establish the original deadline advertised by the Home Office to apply for settled status; and provide real guarantees that the situation of EU nationals living in Britain will not be affected in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p><strong>Diane Abbott MP</strong><em> Shadow home secretary, </em><strong>Alf Dubs</strong><em> Labour, House of Lords</em><strong>, Kevin Courtney</strong><em> General secretary, National Education Union (NEU), </em><strong>Mark Serwotka</strong><em> General secretary, PCS</em>, <strong>Sabby Dhalu </strong><strong>and Weyman Bennett</strong><em> Stand Up To Racism co</em><em>-convenors</em>, <strong>Mohammed Kozbar</strong><em> Finsbury Park Mosque chairperson &amp; Muslim Association of Britain</em>, <strong>Rabbi Lee Wax</strong><em>, </em><strong>Kate Osamor MP, Catherine West MP, Lloyd </strong><strong>Russell-Moyle MP, Peter Hain </strong><em>Labour, House of Lords, </em><strong>Julie Ward MEP, Claude Moraes MEP, Mike Hedges</strong><em> Welsh assembly member, </em><strong>Shahrar Ali</strong><em> Green party home affairs spokesperson, </em><strong>Unmesh Desai</strong><em> </em><em>London Assembly, </em><strong>Rokhsana Fiaz</strong><em> Newham mayor, </em><strong>Manuel Cortez</strong><em> TSSA general secretary, </em><strong>Ronnie Draper</strong><em> BFAWU general secretary, </em><strong>Jane Loftus</strong><em> CWU president, </em><strong>Ian Hodson</strong><em> BFAWU president, </em><strong>Maz Saleem</strong><em> Anti-racist campaigner, </em><strong>Salma Yaqoob</strong><em> Campaigner and activist, </em><strong>Gerry Gable</strong><em> Searchlight editor, </em><strong>Julia Bard</strong><em> Jewish Socialist Group, </em><strong>Louise Raw</strong><em> Author</em></p> <p>\u2022 My Swedish wife of 60 years and I are in a very similar situation to your correspondents (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/its-not-easy-to-apply-for-settled-status\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 3 September) who describe their difficulties in getting settled status.

Couldn\u2019t the Home Office set up a helpline for such people? Much worry and stress could thus be avoided.<br><strong>Richard Griffiths</strong><br><em>Syderstone, Norfolk</em></p> <p>\u2022 I came to the UK 17 years ago, in 2002, with two children aged eight and nine. They are more British than French, having gone through the British education system from primary school to university. Yet none of them has been granted settled status.</p> <p>The eldest, in Australia and with another 18 months left travelling, has not been able to apply for settled status and will not meet the deadline of December 2020.</p> <p>The youngest works in London but has only been granted pre-settled status as he could not provide proof of five years of wages \u2013 he is now trying to justify his status with student loan documentation etc.</p> <p>My husband is British, but that does not come into account. Oh, and the dog will not be able to travel with us unless we plan a very long time in advance. The family is being torn apart.</p> <p>I ha have always worked and contributed in this country; I volunteer for local associations but now feel like a second-class citizen.

      "bodyText": "In his first statement as prime minister, Boris Johnson gave \u201cunequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 million EU nationals now living and working among us \u2026 that, under this government, they will have the absolute certainty for the right to live and remain\u201d. In less than a day, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson rushed to clarify that this did not mean new legislation would be proposed. Instead Johnson would maintain the EU Settlement Scheme. As campaigners have pointed out, the current scheme implies that migrants who fail to apply will lose their legal status and residency rights. Figures suggest at least 2 million EU nationals have not applied for settled status yet. In order to be given settled status, migrants have to prove they have lived in the UK for at least five years. To make matters worse, the Home Office has brought forward the deadline for applications from 30 June 2021 to 31 December 2020. This is the perfect recipe for a repetition of the Windrush generation scandal. Islamophobic and racist comments by Johnson and his support for leaders such as Viktor Orb\u00e1n suggest that the likelihood of racist attacks on migrant rights is high, as does Johnson\u2019s commitment to a points-based immigration system. Legislation should be passed to guarantee the legal status of all EU migrants who live here. At a minimum the government must: scrap the five-year cap \u2013 every EU national resident in the UK should preserve all their current rights; re-establish the original deadline advertised by the Home Office to apply for settled status; and provide real guarantees that the situation of EU nationals living in Britain will not be affected in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

My wife, who had a severe stroke in 1998 with multiple health consequences, is unable to go anywhere \u2013 as she would have to \u2013 to renew her lapsed passport, and my technological skills, needed to make an application to the Home Office on her behalf, are limited, to put it mildly. I imagine there could be many elderly EU nationals in the UK who will face similar problems. Couldn\u2019t the Home Office set up a helpline for such people? Much worry and stress could thus be avoided. Richard Griffiths Syderstone, Norfolk \u2022 I came to the UK 17 years ago, in 2002, with two children aged eight and nine. They are more British than French, having gone through the British education system from primary school to university. Yet none of them has been granted settled status. The eldest, in Australia and with another 18 months left travelling, has not been able to apply for settled status and will not meet the deadline of December 2020. The youngest works in London but has only been granted pre-settled status as he could not provide proof of five years of wages \u2013 he is now trying to justify his status with student loan documentation etc. My husband is British, but that does not come into account. Oh, and the dog will not be able to travel with us unless we plan a very long time in advance. The family is being torn apart. I ha have always worked and contributed in this country; I volunteer for local associations but now feel like a second-class citizen. As for applying for citizenship, it would have been an option if the cost wasn\u2019t exorbitant and therefore out of reach. Emanuele Maindron Ashford, Kent \u2022 I am very sympathetic to EU nationals facing the great and absurd difficulties of obtaining settlement status now.

As recently as April Berrettini was ranked outside the top 50, his future promising but his ceiling uncertain. He has spent his spring and summer breaking through across three surfaces, winning titles on clay and grass, reaching his first grand slam fourth round at Wimbledon and then thriving in the chaos of New York. He now faces Nadal, who has lost only one set here, and he responded to that by punishing the 2014 champion, Marin Cilic, 6-1, 6-2 in their final two sets. Nadal has won 25 of his last 26 matches and he will attempt to obliterate Berrettini\u2019s weaker backhand as he has done to so many over the years. Berrettini will have to handle pressure, hit his two-handed backhand as well as he ever has and, when Nadal draws out yet another error with his series of wicked, spinning high forehands, have to calm himself in a familiar manner.",

      "body": "<p>Political events have always had an impact on the world\u2019s financial markets but rarely have they mattered quite so much as they do now.</p> <p>Take two current examples. The latest news from Germany on Thursday was dire, with a plunge in factory orders adding to the risk of a technical recession \u2013 two successive quarters of negative growth. Normally, this would be a reason to sell German shares but the Frankfurt stock market was up.</p> <p>Why? Because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/05/us-and-china-agree-to-reopen-trade-talks-in-october\">trade tensions </a>between the US and China appear to have eased. Hopes of a deal when top-level talks resume in Washington next month boosted share prices on most bourses. Germany, an export-dependent economy, has more than most to gain from a trade truce.</p> <p>The London Stock Exchange was one market not to join in the party. That\u2019s because the leading index of shares \u2013 the FTSE 100 \u2013 is dominated by companies that do most of their business overseas and whose sterling earnings rise as the pound goes down.</p> <p>Sterling is currently on the rise, not because there has been any good economic news but because investors think the government\u2019s defeats in a series of parliamentary votes has reduced the chances of a no-deal Brexit. There was even a spike in the pound\u2019s value when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/jo-johnson-quits-as-mp-and-minister-citing-national-interest\">Jo Johnson</a>, the prime minister\u2019s brother, announced he was quitting. Sterling has become a barometer of Brexit.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say nothing else matters. Share prices are being supported by the belief that the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are going to cut interest rates this month.</p> <p>But tweets from the White House and the numbers going through the division lobbies at Westminster currently matter more. And that should be a reason for caution because Donald Trump is likely to take a tough line with China until the 2020 presidential election in November next year and Britain is heading for a general election, the outcome of which is impossible to predict. The sensitivity of financial markets to political events means they will remain volatile.</p> <h2>IMF faces uncomfortable questions over Argentina</h2> <p>Christine Lagarde <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/03/christine-lagarde-the-key-issues-she-must-address-at-ecb-\">looks to have got out of the International Monetary Fund just in time</a> because an almighty storm is about to break over the financial assistance provided by the Washington-based organisation to troubled Argentina.</p> <p>The problems with the $57bn (\u00a346bn) loan to shore up South America\u2019s second-biggest economy are manifold. For a start, under its own rules the fund is not supposed to lend to countries with unsustainable debts unless a restructuring happens first. It broke that rule in Argentina\u2019s case.</p> <p>As is usual, Argentina had to abide by strict conditions in order to qualify for IMF assistance.

      "bodyText": "Political events have always had an impact on the world\u2019s financial markets but rarely have they mattered quite so much as they do now. Take two current examples. The latest news from Germany on Thursday was dire, with a plunge in factory orders adding to the risk of a technical recession \u2013 two successive quarters of negative growth. Normally, this would be a reason to sell German shares but the Frankfurt stock market was up. Why? Because trade tensions between the US and China appear to have eased. Hopes of a deal when top-level talks resume in Washington next month boosted share prices on most bourses. Germany, an export-dependent economy, has more than most to gain from a trade truce. The London Stock Exchange was one market not to join in the party. That\u2019s because the leading index of shares \u2013 the FTSE 100 \u2013 is dominated by companies that do most of their business overseas and whose sterling earnings rise as the pound goes down. Sterling is currently on the rise, not because there has been any good economic news but because investors think the government\u2019s defeats in a series of parliamentary votes has reduced the chances of a no-deal Brexit. There was even a spike in the pound\u2019s value when Jo Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s brother, announced he was quitting. Sterling has become a barometer of Brexit. That\u2019s not to say nothing else matters. Share prices are being supported by the belief that the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are going to cut interest rates this month. But tweets from the White House and the numbers going through the division lobbies at Westminster currently matter more. And that should be a reason for caution because Donald Trump is likely to take a tough line with China until the 2020 presidential election in November next year and Britain is heading for a general election, the outcome of which is impossible to predict. The sensitivity of financial markets to political events means they will remain volatile. IMF faces uncomfortable questions over Argentina Christine Lagarde looks to have got out of the International Monetary Fund just in time because an almighty storm is about to break over the financial assistance provided by the Washington-based organisation to troubled Argentina. The problems with the $57bn (\u00a346bn) loan to shore up South America\u2019s second-biggest economy are manifold. For a start, under its own rules the fund is not supposed to lend to countries with unsustainable debts unless a restructuring happens first. It broke that rule in Argentina\u2019s case. As is usual, Argentina had to abide by strict conditions in order to qualify for IMF assistance. When these terms were not met, the IMF eased the conditions and lent more money to the government of president Mauricio Macri. The point of an IMF loan is to put struggling economies back on track. In Argentina\u2019s case, much of it went to hedge funds that had previously lent recklessly to the country. Macri was a president the IMF liked the look of: a fiscal conservative and an inflation hawk. But he has not delivered. Inflation is rampant; the economy is contracting and foreign debt is soaring. The size of the loan and the speed with which it has been disbursed raises the suspicion that the IMF is doing its best to keep its man in Buenos Aires in place. But Macri\u2019s grip on power is loosening and in an attempt to stave off defeat in next month\u2019s presidential election he has raised public sector salaries and cut taxes on consumption. Under the terms of the agreement with the IMF, Macri is supposed to be reducing Argentina\u2019s budget deficit not increasing it. What does all this mean? It means Argentina is heading for a political crisis, an economic crisis and a debt crisis. It means that Argentina is heading for a default when it ought to have had its debt restructured. It means that the Fund has failed to learn from its mistakes. And it means that Lagarde\u2019s successor \u2013 Kristalina Georgieva \u2013 will have questions to answer. WeWork float downgrade reflects limited business model Well, who would have thought it? Reports from the US suggest that the office rental company WeWork will have a price tag of $20bn rather than the $47bn previously mooted when it is floated on Wall Street. Potential investors have gleaned that WeWork is not an Uber or an Amazon with a disruptive business model. It is a real estate company that has lost the thick end of $3bn in the past three years.",

      "body": "<p>Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that the government could afford to \u201cturn the page on austerity\u201d as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/sajid-javid-promises-decade-renewal-sets-out-post-brexit-spending\">set out Whitehall spending priorities</a>. Publishing departmental budgets for next year, the chancellor claimed that a rise in spending of 4.1% over this year and next would \u201cbring about a decade of renewal\u201d. Critics warned that his claims were overblown and that nine years of spending cuts would continue to take their toll. Here we assess Javid\u2019s claim that a line is being drawn under austerity.</p> <h2>Why did the government claim that austerity is over?</h2> <p>Day-to-day spending on public services will grow by about \u00a313.8bn between 2019\u221220 and 2020\u221221. This is above the more circumspect spending plans set out by his predecessor, Philip Hammond, in March. Most of the increase \u2013 about \u00a311.7bn \u2013 will take effect in the next financial year. Javid rightly said the increase represented the largest increase in at least 15 years and was a turning point after years of spending cuts. He also topped up next year\u2019s capital spending by \u00a31.7bn. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/department_budgets/giv-3902U6zg2fmBhHox/\" data-alt=\"Government plans\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/department_budgets/giv-3902U6zg2fmBhHox/\">Government plans</a> </figure>  <h2>Why did the coalition government bring in austerity?</h2> <p>The annual public spending deficit \u2013 the difference between government income and expenditure \u2013 reached almost 10% in the wake of the financial crisis. Most of the traditional sources of advice \u2013 the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the governor of the Bank of England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank \u2013 said government spending cuts were needed to balance the books. Under George Osborne, the Treasury forced through measures from 2010 that reduced local authority spending by about 60% and imposed 40% cuts on many government departments. Public investment spending also came to a virtual standstill, bringing to an end 15 years of improvements to hospital and school buildings. Only three budgets were saved from Osborne\u2019s knife: schools, the NHS, and international aid. Osborne\u2019s plan, which included tax cuts for companies, was supposed to spur growth and reduce the government deficit \u2013 the gap between income and expenditure \u2013 to zero by 2015. Cuts to the schools budget were introduced two years ago, leading to widespread staff lay-offs and rising deficits, especially in secondary schools.</p> <h2>How much was cut from public spending?</h2> <p>Once inflation is taken into account, <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/rounding-up-putting-the-2019-spending-round-into-context/\">the Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that day-to-day departmental spending fell by \u00a332bn between 2010-11 and 2017-18, from \u00a3334bn to \u00a3302bn</a>. This is a 10% fall. If Britain\u2019s rise in population is taken into account \u2013 to show the effect of diminished government funds being spread across more people \u2013 day-to-day departmental spending fell by 15% between 2009-10 and 2017-18, from \u00a35,340 per person in 2009-10 to \u00a34,560. Figures released last year by the House of Commons Library revealed that \u00a337bn was on course to be sliced off the welfare budget by 2021, a 25% reduction in real terms since 2010.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/public-spending/giv-3902prdAHQ8ompNj/\" data-alt=\"Legacy of cuts\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/public-spending/giv-3902prdAHQ8ompNj/\">Legacy of cuts</a> </figure>  <h2>What was the economic impact?</h2> <p>The financial crisis hurt British businesses and the financial sector. While the government used about \u00a3100bn of taxpayer funds to bail out banks (much of which has subsequently been recouped), the dramatic cuts in public spending meant ministers had reduced means to support households \u2013 the bedrock of spending in the economy \u2013 and the wider business community. At the time, Labour proposed maintaining public investment, arguing that with borrowing rates at historic lows in the post-crash period, there was an opportunity to improve the UK\u2019s infrastructure on the cheap. With a Conservative-led government unprepared to step in, businesses remained nervous about the future and private investment failed to take off. Employment jumped to a record high, but without an increase in public or private investment, productivity stagnated and wages rose more slowly than inflation, leaving household incomes depressed.</p> <h2>Does Wednesday\u2019s statement restore those cuts?</h2> <p>The IFS said Javid\u2019s spending plans <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14312\">were enough to reverse </a><a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14312\">about </a><a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14312\">two-thirds of the real-terms cuts</a> to average day-to-day spending on public services since 2010. However, this achievement is even less significant when Britain\u2019s rising population is taken into account. On a per-capita basis, only one-third of the cuts are reversed. The average rise of 4.1% across Whitehall also masks substantial variation within the total. \u201cIf we exclude health, the additional spending will only be enough to reverse around a quarter of the cuts since 2010 (or around 15% of the per capita cuts to non-health areas),\u201d the IFS said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2019-09-04T15:32:22/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Day-to-day spending\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2019-09-04T15:32:22/embed.html\">Day-to-day spending</a> </figure>  <h2>What more will any government need to do to definitively end austerity?</h2> <p>If Boris Johnson wins the looming general election, the autumn budget is likely to feature the \u00a320bn of tax cuts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnsons-tax-cut-would-benefit-richest-10-most-say-experts\">that he has championed</a>. These are commitments that are likely to limit the scope for further increases in departmental or welfare spending. According to the Resolution Foundation, departments such as work and pensions will have suffered cuts of 69% compared with 2010 figures, even if the 2020-21 increases are taken into account. On the same calculations, the justice department has suffered a cut of 31% and local government 77%. Reversing these cuts will take more than Javid was prepared to offer in his spending review. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit is another way to limit the damage to the economy and government tax receipts. However, Javid said he would review the government\u2019s fiscal rules, which bind the Treasury\u2019s ability to lift austerity because they curb spending. Under these guidelines, borrowing must not exceed 2% of GDP and public debt must keep falling as a percentage of GDP. If they are scrapped, greater progress can be made on rowing back austerity.</p>",

Why did the government claim that austerity is over? Day-to-day spending on public services will grow by about \u00a313.8bn between 2019\u221220 and 2020\u221221. This is above the more circumspect spending plans set out by his predecessor, Philip Hammond, in March. Most of the increase \u2013 about \u00a311.7bn \u2013 will take effect in the next financial year. Javid rightly said the increase represented the largest increase in at least 15 years and was a turning point after years of spending cuts. He also topped up next year\u2019s capital spending by \u00a31.7bn. Why did the coalition government bring in austerity? The annual public spending deficit \u2013 the difference between government income and expenditure \u2013 reached almost 10% in the wake of the financial crisis. Most of the traditional sources of advice \u2013 the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the governor of the Bank of England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank \u2013 said government spending cuts were needed to balance the books. Under George Osborne, the Treasury forced through measures from 2010 that reduced local authority spending by about 60% and imposed 40% cuts on many government departments. Public investment spending also came to a virtual standstill, bringing to an end 15 years of improvements to hospital and school buildings. Only three budgets were saved from Osborne\u2019s knife: schools, the NHS, and international aid. Osborne\u2019s plan, which included tax cuts for companies, was supposed to spur growth and reduce the government deficit \u2013 the gap between income and expenditure \u2013 to zero by 2015. Cuts to the schools budget were introduced two years ago, leading to widespread staff lay-offs and rising deficits, especially in secondary schools. How much was cut from public spending? Once inflation is taken into account, the Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that day-to-day departmental spending fell by \u00a332bn between 2010-11 and 2017-18, from \u00a3334bn to \u00a3302bn. This is a 10% fall. If Britain\u2019s rise in population is taken into account \u2013 to show the effect of diminished government funds being spread across more people \u2013 day-to-day departmental spending fell by 15% between 2009-10 and 2017-18, from \u00a35,340 per person in 2009-10 to \u00a34,560. Figures released last year by the House of Commons Library revealed that \u00a337bn was on course to be sliced off the welfare budget by 2021, a 25% reduction in real terms since 2010. What was the economic impact? The financial crisis hurt British businesses and the financial sector. While the government used about \u00a3100bn of taxpayer funds to bail out banks (much of which has subsequently been recouped), the dramatic cuts in public spending meant ministers had reduced means to support households \u2013 the bedrock of spending in the economy \u2013 and the wider business community. At the time, Labour proposed maintaining public investment, arguing that with borrowing rates at historic lows in the post-crash period, there was an opportunity to improve the UK\u2019s infrastructure on the cheap. With a Conservative-led government unprepared to step in, businesses remained nervous about the future and private investment failed to take off. Employment jumped to a record high, but without an increase in public or private investment, productivity stagnated and wages rose more slowly than inflation, leaving household incomes depressed. Does Wednesday\u2019s statement restore those cuts? The IFS said Javid\u2019s spending plans were enough to reverse about two-thirds of the real-terms cuts to average day-to-day spending on public services since 2010. However, this achievement is even less significant when Britain\u2019s rising population is taken into account. On a per-capita basis, only one-third of the cuts are reversed. The average rise of 4.1% across Whitehall also masks substantial variation within the total. \u201cIf we exclude health, the additional spending will only be enough to reverse around a quarter of the cuts since 2010 (or around 15% of the per capita cuts to non-health areas),\u201d the IFS said. What more will any government need to do to definitively end austerity? If Boris Johnson wins the looming general election, the autumn budget is likely to feature the \u00a320bn of tax cuts that he has championed. These are commitments that are likely to limit the scope for further increases in departmental or welfare spending. According to the Resolution Foundation, departments such as work and pensions will have suffered cuts of 69% compared with 2010 figures, even if the 2020-21 increases are taken into account. On the same calculations, the justice department has suffered a cut of 31% and local government 77%. Reversing these cuts will take more than Javid was prepared to offer in his spending review. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit is another way to limit the damage to the economy and government tax receipts. However, Javid said he would review the government\u2019s fiscal rules, which bind the Treasury\u2019s ability to lift austerity because they curb spending. Under these guidelines, borrowing must not exceed 2% of GDP and public debt must keep falling as a percentage of GDP. If they are scrapped, greater progress can be made on rowing back austerity.",

The new front in this crusade, involving the humble lightbulb, has sparked a fresh outcry from opponents who vowed to power up a legal challenge. \u201cWith all that\u2019s at stake in the world, the Trump administration has chosen to declare war on energy-efficient light bulbs,\u201d said Xavier Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general. \u201cThis is but another dim-witted move that will waste energy at the expense of our people and planet.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A runner who died after a broken leg sustained during a half marathon was misdiagnosed as a pulled hamstring was the victim of \u201cgross failings and neglect\u201d, a coroner has concluded. Sarah-Jayne Roche, 39, who has two children, died as she was operated on 12 days after she collapsed during the Cardiff half marathon. She attended hospital three times before the broken femur was diagnosed and died after developing deep vein thrombosis. The coroner, Graeme Hughes, said on Thursday there were three \u201cred flag opportunities\u201d missed to x-ray Roche, leading to a \u201cgross failure\u201d. Hughes found that had there been an x-ray, the operation would have taken place a week earlier. The inquest previously heard Roche, from Beddau, near Pontypridd in south Wales, was running the race on 5 October last year to raise money for a Parkinson\u2019s charity after her father, Alan, was diagnosed with the disease. At the seven-mile point in the race, which she was running with her husband Steven, 42, she felt \u201ca shooting pain up her leg\u201d and came to a halt. She visited hospital on three occasions, where she was given painkillers and told to apply ice, but was not sent for an x-ray. Hughes said: \u201cI am satisfied, had she been x-rayed on October 7, 8 or 12, on the balance of probabilities she would have survived and not died on the 19 October.\u201d The coroner said there was a failure in Roche\u2019s care when all three hospital appointments were \u201cconsidered cumulatively\u201d. He said: \u201cThey do amount to a sufficient level of fault. There were three \u2026 red flag opportunities to procure an x-ray.\u201d The coroner added there was a \u201cserious underestimation\u201d of Roche\u2019s condition and the fact her fracture was rare was \u201cirrelevant\u201d. Hughes said: \u201cWhilst undergoing surgery to fix a fractured femur at the Royal Glamorgan hospital Sarah-Jayne Roche developed pulmonary thromboembolism as a consequence of an undetected and undiagnosed deep vein thrombosis. \u201cShe went into cardiac arrest and despite extensive resuscitation attempts died at 7pm that evening.\u201d He added there was a \u201cgross failure on the part of clinicians\u201d to develop correct diagnoses, contributing to the development of DVT, pulmonary thromboembolism and her death. The coroner said there was \u201cconflicting\u201d evidence from Dr Tim Manfield, who saw Roche and her mother, Patricia Newman, on 12 October. Newman claimed the doctor did not physically examine her daughter\u2019s leg, despite being told it was \u201cfreezing cold\u201d. Manfield told the inquest: \u201cThat is untrue, I remember feeling the knee, thigh and hamstring and pulling on the lower leg.\u201d Manfield also told the inquest that he ordered an ultrasound but the paperwork was never found. The inquest heard Roche, a school worker, had set running the half marathon as a personal challenge to complete before she was 40. Kamal Asaad, the medical director of Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, said: \u201cWe are deeply sorry about Sarah-Jayne\u2019s death and would like to offer a sincere and unreserved apology to her family and friends for the failings in her care. \u201cWords are of little comfort at this distressing time but we would like to assure the family that changes have already been made to help prevent such failures in the system from happening in the future. \u201cA full investigation into the care she received was instigated immediately, and actions are being taken and closely monitored to address the shortcomings that were identified.

      "bodyText": "Crazy Rich Asians co-writer Adele Lim has dropped out of two planned sequels to the hit romantic comedy, after learning she would be paid about an eighth of what another writer, Peter Chiarelli, would earn. Lim told the Hollywood Reporter her perspective was too often used as \u201csoy sauce\u201d \u2013 a dressing added to give a project the mere feel of cultural authenticity. The massive pay disparity came to light on Wednesday when THR, citing unnamed sources, found that Chiarelli stood to make $800,000 to $1m from the two movies, while Lim stood to make \u201c$110,000-plus\u201d. The paper pointed out that in Hollywood, the disparity is not that unusual. Before Crazy Rich Asians, Lim worked in TV. Chiarelli has hit movies on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 including the 2009 Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds romcom The Proposal. Crazy Rich Asians, which made $238m at the box office, is credited with uncovering a new target audience. Its sequels will be based on two other books by Kevin Kwan, China Rich Girlfriend and Rich People Problems. Lim reportedly rejected an offer from Chiarelli to split his fee, voicing concern that producers viewed her ability to provide a distinct cultural sensibility as her only value to the screenplay. She said Chiarelli had been \u201cincredibly gracious\u201d but insisted her pay \u201cshouldn\u2019t be dependent on the generosity of the white guy writer\u201d. \u201cIf I couldn\u2019t get pay equity after CRA,\u201d she said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it would be like for anyone else, given that the standard for how much you\u2019re worth is having established quotes from previous movies, which women of colour would never have been [hired for].\u201d The issue of pay gaps, often between genders, has been battering Hollywood.

The figures, released by the Home Office, compare with the 28, 10 and six people from a suspected far-right background who were detained in previous years. By comparison, the number of suspected Islamist extremists being held peaked in the 12 months to the end of June 2017, when 185 people believed to have Islamist extremist ideologies were in custody in prison and on remand for a terror-related offence. It dropped to 178 last year, and 171 in the 12 months to the end of June this year, according to the figures which were published on Thursday. The far-right cohort includes individuals from politically far-right groups such as National Action, which became the first extreme rightwing group to be proscribed as a terrorist organisation in 2016. Individuals who were found guilty of membership of National Action last year included a neo-Nazi couple who named their baby son after Hitler and a British army veteran who served in Afghanistan. The security minister, Brandon Lewis, said of the latest figures: \u201cThese statistics show just one part of the breadth of work undertaken by the government, police, security and intelligence agencies and local authorities to reduce the terrorist threat. \u201cFrom arrests and prosecutions to safeguarding and early intervention through our Prevent programme, we will continue to do what it takes to keep the public safe.\u201d However, the comments from Lewis come as the Home Office continues to face criticism that it is not taking the far-right threat seriously enough. A study by a Whitehall thinktank of far-right fundraising activities found that an \u201cunwillingness\u201d by the UK government to engage with the threat was creating a vacuum in which such groups could flourish. Overall, there were were 266 arrests for suspected terrorism-related activity in the last year, down from 354 in the previous 12 months, in what is a continuation of a downward trend. Of those arrested in 2018/19, nearly a quarter (23%) were released without charge \u2013 the lowest percentage since records began following the 11 September terror attacks in 2001. In 2017/18, nearly half (48%) of all those arrested were released without charge, down from 53% the previous year. British prisons held 218 people in custody for terrorism-related offences as recently as 30 June, according to other Home Office statistics, a figure which was unchanged since the previous year. Of those, 78% were categorised as holding Islamist-extremist views while a further 15% were categorised as holding far rightwing ideologies.

The parents of Tafida Raqeeb, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in February and is on a life-support machine, want to fly her to Italy for treatment against the judgment of doctors at the Royal London hospital. The medics believe it would be in her best interests for life support to be withdrawn and her fate is due to be determined at a five-day hearing at the high court, central London, next week. Before those proceedings, Barts NHS trust, which runs the hospital, made an application on Thursday for one of Tafida\u2019s female relatives to be removed as her \u201clitigation friend\u201d, a child\u2019s representative in court. It made its submissions after Tafida\u2019s mother, Shelina Begum, obtained a fatwa \u2013 a ruling in Islamic law \u2013 from the Islamic Council of Europe, which concluded that it would be a \u201cgreat sin\u201d and \u201cabsolutely impermissible\u201d for the parents or anyone else to consent to the removal of life support. In written submissions, Katie Gollop QC, acting for Barts, said: \u201cThe trust submits that particularly in light of the fatwa, no member of the family is suitable to act as litigation friend.\u201d She continued: \u201cIt is not possible for the family to be open-minded about the fact that a best interests decision made by the [high court\u2019s] family division is, or may be, in Tafida\u2019s best interests.\u201d In response, David Lock QC, acting for Begum and Tafida\u2019s father, Mohammed Raqeeb, told the court: \u201cHowever you dress it up, that\u2019s an outrageous statement for a public body to make.\u201d In his own written submissions, Lock said: \u201cThe logic of the trust\u2019s position is thus that anyone who holds the Islamic faith should, by virtue of adherence to that faith, be debarred from being a litigation friend for Tafida. \u201cRemoving the LF [litigation friend] on the sole ground that she holds to the tenets of a major religion and therefore, as a result of her religious convictions, cannot be anticipated to act in a way that reflects the child\u2019s interests is not only highly offensive but would also be unlawful.\u201d Gollop said it was unfair to suggest the application was discriminatory and rubbished the idea the trust was suggesting no Muslim could be a litigation friend. The judge, Alistair MacDonald QC, rejected the trust\u2019s application, meaning the female relative, who cannot be named under reporting restrictions, can act as Tafida\u2019s litigation friend next week. Begum, who was in court to hear the arguments, said afterwards that the application was unnecessary and that it was deeply distressing to have to leave her daughter\u2019s bedside to attend Thursday\u2019s hearing. Tafida has been in hospital since 9 February after suffering an arteriovenous malformation, a tangle of blood vessels with abnormal connections between arteries and veins. Her parents say she is not brain dead and has shown gradual but encouraging signs of recovery, including in her breathing.

In case you have somehow not downloaded the Jeremy Renner app \u2013 called, simply, \u201cJeremy Renner\u201d \u2013 it was a bit like Instagram, but only for pictures of Jeremy Renner, posted by Jeremy Renner, with Jeremy Renneresque captions such as: \u201cHave a rockin weekend everyone!!!\u201d You could communicate with other Jeremy Renner fans, and every time someone commented back to you on the app you got a push notification that, due to an incredibly thoughtless quirk of design, made it seem as if Jeremy Renner himself was whispering it directly into your phone. So you could type, say, I don\u2019t know: \u201cI literally don\u2019t know how my movie career happened. I am entirely charmless and a completely forgettable actor.

For pool stage fixtures, if the match begins but is abandoned before half\u2011time, two points will also be awarded to both teams although points scored in the match, and bonus points, will still count. The result will stand if a match is abandoned at or after half-time and the same cut-off point applies in knockout matches.",

      "body": "<p>Even if you are not an aficionado of motor sports, let alone the particular branch of it that revolves around US race competitions such as the Indy 500, this documentary on injury medicine within this sector was, surprisingly, a little bit interesting. Perhaps that\u2019s because directors Roger Hinze and Michael William Miles so single-mindedly keep the focus on the medical track, as opposed to the asphalt one, which makes physicians such as on-site medical officer Stephen Olvey and orthopaedic surgeon Terry Trammell the real heroes of the story, rather than drivers such as Mario Andretti. It\u2019s as if, say, a history of an architectural style is being told through the eyes of plumbers \u2013 not where you would expect the focus to be but interesting nonetheless.</p> <p>Rapid Response, however, doesn\u2019t start well. The first section offers a string of crash footage accompanied by talking heads explaining just how bad the mutilations are, as if made by a diehard fan of the gore-porn of JG Ballard\u2019s Crash. But then it starts to explore how the rapid responders\u2019 interventions began to inform the sport, shaping first the emergency procedures on the track \u2013 amazingly, it took a while for the organisers to think of having helicopters on hand to evacuate injured drivers \u2013 and then even the design of the cars.</p> <p>utterly unsurprised to learn that any innovations in safety that caused the cars to slow down were resisted, even if they saved lives, but eventually some of that safety tech crossed over into car design for regular vehicles. Meanwhile, just as wars help improve trauma medicine, this highly dangerous sport over time helped to refine the treatment of foot, hand and head injuries and so on. There are some neat, borderline gory animations to illustrate how concussions work, which for this viewer were a lot more interesting than the endless stretches of racing footage.

      "bodyText": "Even if you are not an aficionado of motor sports, let alone the particular branch of it that revolves around US race competitions such as the Indy 500, this documentary on injury medicine within this sector was, surprisingly, a little bit interesting. Perhaps that\u2019s because directors Roger Hinze and Michael William Miles so single-mindedly keep the focus on the medical track, as opposed to the asphalt one, which makes physicians such as on-site medical officer Stephen Olvey and orthopaedic surgeon Terry Trammell the real heroes of the story, rather than drivers such as Mario Andretti. It\u2019s as if, say, a history of an architectural style is being told through the eyes of plumbers \u2013 not where you would expect the focus to be but interesting nonetheless. Rapid Response, however, doesn\u2019t start well. The first section offers a string of crash footage accompanied by talking heads explaining just how bad the mutilations are, as if made by a diehard fan of the gore-porn of JG Ballard\u2019s Crash. But then it starts to explore how the rapid responders\u2019 interventions began to inform the sport, shaping first the emergency procedures on the track \u2013 amazingly, it took a while for the organisers to think of having helicopters on hand to evacuate injured drivers \u2013 and then even the design of the cars. utterly unsurprised to learn that any innovations in safety that caused the cars to slow down were resisted, even if they saved lives, but eventually some of that safety tech crossed over into car design for regular vehicles. Meanwhile, just as wars help improve trauma medicine, this highly dangerous sport over time helped to refine the treatment of foot, hand and head injuries and so on. There are some neat, borderline gory animations to illustrate how concussions work, which for this viewer were a lot more interesting than the endless stretches of racing footage. The anonymous, off-the-peg score of backing music and flat editing, however, still make this a bit of a slog. \u2022 Rapid Response is released in the US and the UK on 6 September.",

Hundreds of researchers on the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team will share the $3m Breakthrough prize in fundamental physics for their image of the monster black hole at the heart of Messier 87, a galaxy 55m light years from Earth.

The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, speaking at an economic forum shortly after Tsemakh\u2019s release on Thursday, said Moscow and Kyiv were finalising talks on whom to exchange, adding that the swap would be \u201clarge\u201d.

Russia is holding dozens of Ukrainian prisoners, including 24 sailors captured in November and the film-maker Oleh Sentsov.</p> <p>Forty European MEPs called on the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, this week not to release Tsemakh, saying in a letter: \u201cHis availability and testimony before the joint investigation team is thus of the utmost importance for an effective prosecution by the countries involved.\u201d</p> <p>In a telephone interview, Kati Piri, a member of the European parliament from the Netherlands, said: \u201cIt seems to be preparations to swap him.

      "bodyText": "A Ukrainian court has released a potential suspect and key witness in the shooting down of MH17, as Russia\u2019s president said the two countries were working on a deal to swap prisoners. Vladimir Tsemakh had bragged on video of commanding an anti-air brigade in separatist-held east Ukraine and indicated he hid evidence of a Buk missile system, the kind Dutch investigators say shot down the Malaysia Airlines jet with 298 people on board. Tsemakh, who was arrested in a raid in June, has been charged with terrorism for his part fighting for the Russian-backed separatists, but on Thursday he was abruptly released on his own recognisance pending trial. His place in a swap with Russia has not been confirmed but has been widely rumoured in media. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, speaking at an economic forum shortly after Tsemakh\u2019s release on Thursday, said Moscow and Kyiv were finalising talks on whom to exchange, adding that the swap would be \u201clarge\u201d. He did not specifically mention Tsemakh. The reports have worried Dutch investigators and lawmakers, who fear Russia will pressure Ukraine to give up one of the few suspects in the case in custody. Russia is holding dozens of Ukrainian prisoners, including 24 sailors captured in November and the film-maker Oleh Sentsov. Forty European MEPs called on the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, this week not to release Tsemakh, saying in a letter: \u201cHis availability and testimony before the joint investigation team is thus of the utmost importance for an effective prosecution by the countries involved.\u201d In a telephone interview, Kati Piri, a member of the European parliament from the Netherlands, said: \u201cIt seems to be preparations to swap him. Of course we don\u2019t know this 100% for sure yet but that\u2019s how I read the signals. \u201cYou can imagine that not just for the Netherlands, but also for the EU and all the families of the victims of MH17, this is a very, very bad moment \u2026 I understand the situation but not on MH17, not just a witness but possible suspect, that is a step too far from our perspective.\u201d According to reports, Tsemakh was captured in a raid into eastern Ukraine behind the lines controlled by Russian-backed separatists and then smuggled out of the region, possibly in disguise. His capture was quickly publicised and recognised as a possible breakthrough in the Dutch-led investigation into the attack on MH17. Of the 298 passengers, 196 were Dutch citizens. Yet during his time behind bars Tsemakh was not questioned by Dutch investigators, who said on Wednesday they wanted to speak to him as a person of interest in the case. Brechtje van de Moosdijk, a spokeswoman for the Dutch-led MH17 investigation, told the Associated Press: \u201cIf he\u2019s being swapped then, well, of course it\u2019s hard to say that we can speak to him when he would be in Russia.\u201d Ukrainian media have also released a leaked letter from the Dutch investigation head, Fred Westerbeke, calling Tsemakh a suspect in the downing of MH17, rather than just a witness. The letter\u2019s authenticity has been confirmed by the Dutch outlet NRC. Tsemakh is a Ukrainian citizen and his release to Russia would mark an unusually strong interest by Moscow in the case of a foreign citizen. The Dutch-led investigation has named four suspects in the downing of MH17, including one Ukrainian and three Russian citizens. All are believed to be living in Russia or Crimea. The most prominent, the former separatist leader Igor Girkin, lives openly in Moscow.",

A demand for a looser level of cooperation was made by Johnson\u2019s EU envoy, David Frost, during the recent talks in Brussels with the European commission negotiators. The UK is arguably the EU\u2019s strongest defence power, and one of only two member states alongside France possessing the \u201cfull spectrum\u201d of military capabilities. Senior Conservatives, including Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff who is now a Johnson supporter, have long suggested that the British government should use its defence capability as leverage to gain concessions from the EU on trade. The current political declaration contains a commitment to \u201cclose cooperation in union-led crisis management missions and operations, both civilian and military\u201d.

First he has to convince them that good times lie ahead. Second, he and his fellow Brexiters have spent three years telling voters that many of their problems are down to the UK being tied to the EU and their lives will be better when they are \u201cfree\u201d.

The spending increases are justified because interest rates have been too low for too long as a direct result of austerity.

Macroeconomic balance requires interest rates to rise modestly and gradually, and Wednesday\u2019s spending review helps push them in that direction.</p> <p>The case for tax cuts is less clear. Tax as a share of GDP has only risen a little since 2010, and some rise is required to finance the state pension triple lock and a health service that inevitably grows more expensive each year. With spending already rising as a share of GDP, cutting taxes seems to be going too far. However, there is a possible macroeconomic justification for them.</p> <p>Cutting taxes and raising spending, which economists call a fiscal stimulus, makes sense when the economy is depressed because of deficient demand. The UK economy is depressed, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/09/uk-economy-contracts-on-back-of-brexit-uncertainty\" title=\"\">no growth in GDP</a> per head during the first half of this year. So if this poor performance is due to a lack of demand, we have a case for a fiscal stimulus. But is it?</p> <p>To answer that question we first need to ask another. If the economy is so depressed, why hasn\u2019t the Bank of England already cut interest rates from their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/20/bank-of-england-keeps-rates-unchanged-as-it-cuts-growth-forecast-to-zero\" title=\"\">current 0.75%</a>?

The United Nations estimates about 70,000 people in the Bahamas are in need of some form of disaster relief in the wake of Dorian. About 20 relief organizations have mobilized on the Bahamas, including the US Coast Guard and the Royal Marines who have run emergency evacuations for critically ill people since Tuesday. But with the airports in the northern islands either still closed or completely destroyed, delivering aid and continuing evacuations has been slow. A steady stream of evacuees from the Abaco Islands streamed into the rescue centre at a private airstrip in Nassau throughout Wednesday. Gary Smith, 67, a lay minister from the St Andrew Baptist church on the Abaco Islands clutched a small bag with everything he was able to salvage from his destroyed home \u2013 a passport and a few other documents. \u201cI\u2019m feeling grateful to almighty God,\u201d he said, adding that almost every church in his community had been destroyed by Dorian.

      "body": "<p>Jarvis Cocker has packed a lot into his 55 years. For 26 of them he fronted Pulp, who created one of the genuinely era-defining songs of the 1990s with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuTMWgOduFM\" title=\"\">Common People</a>. He made seven albums with Pulp, has made two solo albums and written songs for the likes of Marianne Faithfull and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Other extra-curricular activities range from appearing on Question Time to starring in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJeqIuxkwYk\" title=\"\">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>. But it\u2019s not enough.</p> <p>\u201cMy output isn\u2019t as much as I would have hoped,\u201d he says, softly. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that.\u201d</p> <p>We are in a small, darkened dressing room in Leith theatre, Edinburgh, where Cocker \u2013 outsize glasses, double corduroy and Yorkshire Tea \u2013 is adding another string to his bow fronting Jarv Is, the first new band he has formed since starting <a href=\"https://pulpsongs.wordpress.com/2012/01/14/3-to-8-arabicus-pulp/\" title=\"\">Arabicus Pulp</a> in 1978 at school in Sheffield.</p> <p>From 2010 until 2017, Cocker was a BBC 6Music DJ. He loved being able to inflict on the general public the peculiar records from his basement that he normally played only to himself or friends. A new compilation \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ptsjd\" title=\"\">Music from Jarvis Cocker\u2019s Sunday Service</a> \u2013 brings some of them together. Sheffield electronic pioneers Cabaret Voltaire nestle alongside 1960s Leeds singer-songwriter Jake Thackray. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAqxRA7h0Ds\" title=\"\">Antony and the Johnsons\u2019 haunting version of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Crazy in Love</a> appears alongside a Trinidadian steel band\u2019s strangely mesmeric remake of Gary Numan\u2019s Cars.</p> <p>\u201cI half-jokingly said I wanted to bring the boredom back to Sunday afternoons,\u201d he chuckles, but notes that he is old enough to remember when Sunday afternoons were boring and \u201cyou had to make your own entertainment, and really think about it\u201d. So, he played \u201cthe sort of records that you\u2019d never hear on the radio or anywhere really. Mellow music and spoken-word stuff people could let flow through their mind.\u201d</p> <p>The problem was, he kept feeling an urge to make more music.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d hesitate to describe it as a calling or whatever,\u201d he says, \u201cBut at the back of my mind I felt like I was moonlighting from what I should be doing.\u201d So, in 2017, he pulled the plug on his DJing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1528cc2619be01b3453c5d1c70f594b776bbb2ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1528cc2619be01b3453c5d1c70f594b776bbb2ff/0_4_3856_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I wanted to make the new songs more open-ended\u2019\u2026 Cocker with his new band Jarv Is, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I wanted to make the new songs more open-ended\u2019\u2026 Cocker with his new band Jarv Is, 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniele Baldi/Pacific Press via ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, he made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/19/jarvis-cocker-chilly-gonzales-room-29-review-chateau-marmont-hollywood\" title=\"\">an album with Canadian pianist Chilly Gonzales</a> and worked on solo songs on a computer, but it wasn\u2019t happening until he realised it was \u201cblindingly obvious that having been in bands since I was 14, I needed to work with other people, get everybody in a room and say: \u2018This is how it goes. Join in.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ironically, the Sunday Service led partly to the forming of Jarv Is. Cocker was diligently rooting through CDs to play on the radio when he came across one by harpist Serafina Steer. He really liked it, went to see her, produced an album for her and now she is in his band. Steer recommended her bandmate Emma Smith (violin) and before he knew it, Jarv Is were a six-piece.</p> <p>Cocker says the Jarv Is songs \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/22/bluedot-festival-review-jodrell-bank-observatory-cheshire\" title=\"\">which have been going down a storm at festivals</a> \u2013 are different to Pulp\u2019s. \u201cIn the past, there was a firm narrative,\u201d he says, perhaps thinking of Common People\u2019s tale of a rich girl slumming it or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inqL54q7aD4\" title=\"\">Sorted for E\u2019s and Wizz</a>\u2019s askance look at rave culture (\u201cOh, is this the way the future\u2019s meant to feel / Or just 20,000 people standing in a field?\u201d). \u201cI wanted to make them slightly more open-ended and allow people to make their own interpretations.\u201d</p> <p>Thus, Am I Missing Something? (about \u201cgetting to a stage in life and thinking: \u2018Is this it?\u2019\u201d) may or may not channel his own feelings of a lack of fulfilment. I Am Pharoah is \u201ca song about tourism from the perspective of a human statue\u201d; at some gigs they have performed the track alongside one of the painted, motionless and silent street artists that Cocker approached on London\u2019s South Bank, leaving notes with his phone number until one \u2013 who paints himself in diagonal stripes \u2013 finally responded.

      "bodyText": "Jarvis Cocker has packed a lot into his 55 years. For 26 of them he fronted Pulp, who created one of the genuinely era-defining songs of the 1990s with Common People. He made seven albums with Pulp, has made two solo albums and written songs for the likes of Marianne Faithfull and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Other extra-curricular activities range from appearing on Question Time to starring in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. But it\u2019s not enough. \u201cMy output isn\u2019t as much as I would have hoped,\u201d he says, softly. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that.\u201d We are in a small, darkened dressing room in Leith theatre, Edinburgh, where Cocker \u2013 outsize glasses, double corduroy and Yorkshire Tea \u2013 is adding another string to his bow fronting Jarv Is, the first new band he has formed since starting Arabicus Pulp in 1978 at school in Sheffield. From 2010 until 2017, Cocker was a BBC 6Music DJ. He loved being able to inflict on the general public the peculiar records from his basement that he normally played only to himself or friends. A new compilation \u2013 Music from Jarvis Cocker\u2019s Sunday Service \u2013 brings some of them together. Sheffield electronic pioneers Cabaret Voltaire nestle alongside 1960s Leeds singer-songwriter Jake Thackray. Antony and the Johnsons\u2019 haunting version of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Crazy in Love appears alongside a Trinidadian steel band\u2019s strangely mesmeric remake of Gary Numan\u2019s Cars. \u201cI half-jokingly said I wanted to bring the boredom back to Sunday afternoons,\u201d he chuckles, but notes that he is old enough to remember when Sunday afternoons were boring and \u201cyou had to make your own entertainment, and really think about it\u201d. So, he played \u201cthe sort of records that you\u2019d never hear on the radio or anywhere really. Mellow music and spoken-word stuff people could let flow through their mind.\u201d The problem was, he kept feeling an urge to make more music. \u201cI\u2019d hesitate to describe it as a calling or whatever,\u201d he says, \u201cBut at the back of my mind I felt like I was moonlighting from what I should be doing.\u201d So, in 2017, he pulled the plug on his DJing. First, he made an album with Canadian pianist Chilly Gonzales and worked on solo songs on a computer, but it wasn\u2019t happening until he realised it was \u201cblindingly obvious that having been in bands since I was 14, I needed to work with other people, get everybody in a room and say: \u2018This is how it goes. Join in.\u2019\u201d Ironically, the Sunday Service led partly to the forming of Jarv Is. Cocker was diligently rooting through CDs to play on the radio when he came across one by harpist Serafina Steer. He really liked it, went to see her, produced an album for her and now she is in his band. Steer recommended her bandmate Emma Smith (violin) and before he knew it, Jarv Is were a six-piece. Cocker says the Jarv Is songs \u2013 which have been going down a storm at festivals \u2013 are different to Pulp\u2019s. \u201cIn the past, there was a firm narrative,\u201d he says, perhaps thinking of Common People\u2019s tale of a rich girl slumming it or Sorted for E\u2019s and Wizz\u2019s askance look at rave culture (\u201cOh, is this the way the future\u2019s meant to feel / Or just 20,000 people standing in a field?\u201d). \u201cI wanted to make them slightly more open-ended and allow people to make their own interpretations.\u201d Thus, Am I Missing Something? (about \u201cgetting to a stage in life and thinking: \u2018Is this it?\u2019\u201d) may or may not channel his own feelings of a lack of fulfilment. I Am Pharoah is \u201ca song about tourism from the perspective of a human statue\u201d; at some gigs they have performed the track alongside one of the painted, motionless and silent street artists that Cocker approached on London\u2019s South Bank, leaving notes with his phone number until one \u2013 who paints himself in diagonal stripes \u2013 finally responded. Performing alongside him is, Cocker says, \u201cstrangely calming\u201d. Cocker has always firmly believed that being popular doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be off-kilter. Writing a book about creativity \u2013 This Book is a Song, which is due out next autumn \u2013 made him think about where his ideas about pop music came from. \u201cAnd really they were from having listened to the radio for as long as I can remember.\u201d He describes recording his 2009 solo album Further Complications with Nirvana/punk producer Steve Albini, who was \u201caghast\u201d when Cocker told him he loved pop. \u201cHe looked at me like it was the devil\u2019s music. Cos obviously from his point of view it was everything that ruined music.\u201d But Cocker loves the fact that \u201creally strange records\u201d such as Laurie Anderson\u2019s O Superman, which, despite being unashamedly avant garde, got to No 2 in the UK in 1981, used to be able to \u201ccapture the public\u2019s imagination and get in the charts by the democratic act of people \u2018voting\u2019 by buying them\u201d. Cocker blames the death of the singles chart he loved on its late-90s manipulation by record companies, who would price CD singles at 99p on the week of release, then \u00a33.99 thereafter: \u201cRecords would go in at No 1 and disappear the next week because nobody would pay full price.\u201d He admits to being \u201ctotally out of touch with pop music \u2013 or what people call pop now\u201d and says that streaming \u201chas been an interesting thing to get my head around\u201d. Initially, Jarv Is weren\u2019t going to make records at all. They would be a live phenomenon, the idea being: \u201cIf people wanted to hear these songs, they would have to be there in the moment, because that\u2019s it.\u201d But they started selling their single Must I Evolve? (recorded live in a cave near Sheffield called the Devil\u2019s Arse) at gigs and, gradually, Cocker has come around because: \u201cThe perfect recording of the perfect pop song is still my holy grail.\u201d Live, Jarv Is throw in the odd Pulp rarity but having put the band to bed with a reunion tour in 2011 he is in no rush to trade on old glories.

One incident from the period has followed him around \u2013 the time he invaded the stage at the 1996 Brit Awards, wiggling his bottom in protest at Michael Jackson\u2019s performance, in which the star adopted Christ-like poses and surrounded himself with children.

      "bodyText": "A passenger train travelled for 23 minutes at speeds of up to 80mph with a carriage door open, accident investigators have said. During the incident, which took place in August on a Greater Anglia service, the train travelled for about 16 miles before the driver was alerted. Greater Anglia said it had immediately conducted checks on all doors on similar trains of that type. No one was injured in the incident, although passenger groups warned it could have had serious consequences on a more typically crowded train heading in the other direction. The train was travelling out of London Liverpool Street to Southend Victoria in the early morning of 22 August when a passenger reported the open door to the driver at Hockley station in Essex at 7:20am. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has conducted a preliminary examination and said it will publish a \u201csafety digest\u201d in the coming weeks highlighting what lessons can be learned. Greater Anglia\u2019s commercial and customer service director, Martin Moran, said: \u201cSafety is our highest priority. We immediately took the train out of service when this happened and carried out our own investigation into the incident. \u201cWe have also carried out checks on every single door on that type of train that we have. No one was injured in this incident and there have been no further incidents since.\u201d Train doors, and who closes them, have been a core issue in continuing disputes between train operators and unions over the role of guards and driver-controlled trains. The RAIB found that poor training and driver fatigue may have contributed to doors being left open on a London Underground train in a separate incident last September. A Jubilee line service carrying about 30 passengers went between two stations with 10 doors open, travelling for 56 seconds at about 40mph, following a technical fault.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap The pound has surged to a five-week high, as investors grab onto hope that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. Sterling hit $1.235 for the first time since late July, as MPs pressed on with efforts to block a No Deal. City investors predicted the pound would keep rallying if the UK was given another Brexit extension, hitting $1.30 or even $1.35 Germany\u2019s economy has hit fresh problems, with factory orders tumbling in July. Economists say the data show Europe\u2019s largest economy is still struggling. Stock markets around the world have jumped, after America and China agreed to hold fresh trade talks next month. Investors, though, advise caution. Andrew Gwynne MP has summed up Boris Johnson\u2019s week -- with a list of events that have generally pushed the pound higher. Ouch! Growth across America\u2019s service sector companies has slowed to a three-year low. Data firm Markit says there was \u201ca loss of momentum across the U.S service sector\u201d last month,\u201d with new orders slowing and demand from overseas falling. This dragged its services PMI down to 50.7, showing the slowest expansion in business activity since March 2016. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, has the slump in US factories is now spreading across the economy. \u201cUS businesses reported one of the toughest months since the global financial crisis in August, with growth of output, order books and hiring all slowing amid steep falls in both export and business confidence. \u201cOnly on two occasions since the global financial crisis have the US PMI surveys recorded a weaker monthly expansion, and these were months in which business was hit by the government shutdown and bad weather in 2013 and 2016 respectively. This time, trade wars and falling exports appear to be the main drivers of weakness, exacerbating fears of a broader economic slowdown both at home and globally. The strength of the pound has dragged down the London stock market today. The FTSE 100 has lost 50 points, or 0.7%, to 7261. A stronger sterling hits the value of multinational companies with large earnings in foreign currencies. This chart from IG shows how the pound is likely to rally if a no-deal Brexit is averted, pushing the Footsie lower. Rabobank analyst Jane Foley says the pound acting like a \u201ctidy barometer\u201d for the odds of a no-deal Brexit. She told AFP: \u201cJust as fears of a no-deal Brexit pushed the pound below $1.20 earlier this week, expectations that MPs will succeed in delaying Brexit beyond October 31 have resulting in a relief rally back to $1.23. \u201cThe pound is clearly not out of the woods with political uncertainty still at very elevated levels - but the risk of a disorderly Brexit next month at least looks set to be pushed off the table.\u201d Just in: America\u2019s companies created more jobs than expected last month - a good sign for the global economy. The private sector payroll rose by 195,000 last month, stronger than the 140,000 which Wall Street expected. That suggests US companies aren\u2019t being dragged down by issues such as the trade war. Sterling\u2019s travails isn\u2019t doing much for the Conservative Party\u2019s reputation for economic competence. John Gapper of the FT speculates that a Tory win at the next election could trigger a sterling crisis (as it would allow them to drive through a no-deal Brexit). Some City experts are warning that the pound\u2019s recovery may not last. Dutch bank ING says: \u201cA UK election now looks inevitable - the only question now is \u2018when\u2019. However, the chances of a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit on 31 October appear to have receded, but there are still ways it could happen, and given the outcome of an election looks deeply uncertain, despite the Conservatives\u2019 lead in the polls, the rebound in sterling is unlikely to have legs.\u201d John Hardy of Saxo Bank also warns that No Deal is still a significant possibility, depending how an election played out. Sterling continued its strong recovery into today as the immediate threat of a No Deal Brexit has been removed by the latest parliamentary maneuvers, as parliament will likely get its delay to avoid an October 31 No Deal (key question: what will the EU terms be for that delay?) and Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to call for snap elections in mid-October was defeated. There are still too many scenarios from here to signal the all clear \u2013 an election scenario that serves as a referendum on Brexit still presents the risk of an eventual No Deal. The pound is the best-performing major currency against the US dollar this week, the eagle-eyed Financial Times points out The FT says: Sterling rose above $1.23 on Thursday, notching up more than 3 per cent of gains against the dollar from the start of the week as investors cheered repeated blows to Boris Johnson\u2019s attempts to push through a no-deal Brexit. The pound hit a day\u2019s high at $1.2332 in European trading hours after Conservative MP and brother of the UK prime minister Jo Johnson quit his party, in the wake of Wednesday night\u2019s vote in parliament that aims to thwart the prime minister\u2019s promise to leave the EU on October 31 \u201cdo or die\u201d. The gains have made the pound the best performing major currency against the US dollar over the past two days. The currency\u2019s bounce comes after a negative start to the week when the risks of the UK leaving the EU with no deal rose as high as 40 per cent, based on prices in the options market. UBS Wealth Management predict sterling could surge back to $1.30 if Brexit is delayed beyond October. Their chief economist, Dean Turner, told clients that the \u2018Benn bill\u2019 blocking a no-deal Brexit is likely to be approved soon. saying: Sterling has been buffeted by the frenetic pace of events in Parliament over the last couple of days. Removing the immediate threat of a no-deal Brexit has helped the pound recover some of its recent weakness. If, as we expect, Brexit is delayed until January 2020 and an election is held after October, we would expect this recovery to continue. A Brexit delay would push the pound over $1.30, he suspects, a level last seen in May. And if Britain left the EU with a deal, the pound could strengthen to $1.35, which would be a 16-month high. UBS also expects an election soon, even though the Labour Party refused to trigger one last night. Turner says: We have long been of the view that the UK faces an election at some point before the final decision on Brexit is made. We stick to this view now. When the election does come, it is only then that will we have greater clarity on how the Brexit saga will end. Sterling has been moving inversely to Boris Johnson\u2019s authority this week. It fell on Monday as government sources revealed the PM was planning an election on October 14, hitting a three-year low below $1.20 on Tuesday morning. But it then began to recover sharply, as the government dramatically lost its majority on Tuesday afternoon (when Phillip Lee joined the Liberal Democrats). It kept rallying as MPs voted to debate legislation to block No Deal. Sterling picked up the pace on Wednesday as MPs backed this bill, and failed to give Johnson the two-thirds majority needed for a snap election. This morning has seen fresh gains, as pressure continues to mount on the government. The pound has also rallied against the euro, to a one-month high. Sterling is trading at \u20ac1.117, its highest level since 26 July (a few days after Boris Johnson won the Conservative leadership battle) Some City investors are confident that Brexit will delayed until next year. Bloomberg reports: The pound is rallying after Parliament tore up U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy and denied his request for a snap election, tempering fears of further political turmoil, reports Bloomberg. \u201cMy expectation is Brexit is delayed until Jan. 31 with an election after the initial deadline and before the end of January,\u201d said Neil Jones, head of currency sales for financial institutions at Mizuho Bank Ltd. \u201cA delay for both Brexit and a general election will continue to send the pound higher.\u201d The pound hit its highest level in five weeks after Boris Johnson\u2019s own brother announced he is stepping down as a minister and an MP. In a jaw-dropping tweet, Jo Johnson says he has been wrestling with the tension between family loyalty and the national interest! Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the action on another astonishing day: The pound is moving inversely to Boris Johnson\u2019s grip on power. The weaker his government looks, the strong sterling becomes. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: It is all about politics in the markets at the moment. As the Boris Johnson government has progressively lost control of the situation, so sterling has rallied. It now looks more likely that a coalition of rebel Conservative MPs and opposition parties will take a no deal Brexit off the table with legislation, which was what the market was hoping for. Sterling has now surged by 2% since the start of trading on Wednesday, Reuters reports. That\u2019s its best two-day performance in 10 months! Update: The pound has just hit $1.2318, its highest level against the US dollar in five weeks. Sterling is bouncing back from its slump earlier this week, as efforts to prevent a no-deal Brexit next month gather pace. The pound has just smashed through $1.23, up half a cent today. That\u2019s the joint-highest level in five weeks. That\u2019s more than three cents higher than on Tuesday morning, before Boris Johnson lost his majority and MPs seized control of Commons business. City investors are hopeful that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided next month. Overnight, the House of Lords fast-tracked the latest cross-party attempt to block Britain crashing out of the EU. Thank to m\u2019Lordships all-nighter, the legislation will return to the Commons today for further debate, and could be passed by Monday. Prime minister Boris Johnson is continuing to push for a general election to break the deadlock, as he lacks a majority to get anything done. Labour, though, is resisting... at least until a No-Deal is firmly off the table. Europe\u2019s \u2018fear index\u2019, which measures volatility across the markets, has dropped to its lowest point since 1 August. That shows traders are more optimistic about a trade breakthrough in October -- despite warnings to be cautious, given previous hopes have been dashed. Germany\u2019s government has blamed the trade war for the slump in factory orders this summer. Berlin\u2019s economy minister says: \u201cNew orders for industry have overall made a weak start to the third quarter. \u201cGiven still-smouldering international trade conflicts and restrained business expectations, there is no sign of a fundamental improvement in the coming months.\u201d The slump in German factory orders raises the risk that Europe\u2019s largest economy is in recession. German GDP fell by 0.1% in April-June, and there\u2019s little sign of a bounce-back in July-September. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, blames the US-China trade war. Foreign orders from outside the eurozone fell by a dramatic 6.7% MoM, showing once again Germany\u2019s exposure and sensitivity to the ongoing trade conflicts and increasing global uncertainty..... Since the start of the year, domestic orders have actually dropped more than foreign orders, suggesting that global woes have reached the domestic economy. Oxford Economics warn that problems in Germany\u2019s car industry, and Brexit uncertainty, is also hurting: German industry is suffering the worst slump since the financial crisis. Ailing global trade and elevated uncertainty have been obvious drags. But the looming no-deal Brexit and especially the car sector\u2019s malaise were the key triggers of German industry\u2019s historic underperformance relative to European peers. The latest surveys provide no hope of a swift rebound in global trade. Moreover, there\u2019s no clear sign that uncertainty stemming from no-deal Brexit risks and US trade policy will abate, so prospects of a manufacturing rebound are dim. A trade war breakthrough can\u2019t come soon enough for Germany. New figures show that German factory orders fell by 2.7% during July, nearly twice as much as economists expected. On an annual basis, orders were an alarming 5.6% lower than a year ago. That means the slump in German manufacturing has not ended, as the global slowdown and trade tensions hit demand for goods. Destatis, the German statistics offices, says orders from beyond the eurozone fell sharply in July: Domestic orders decreased by 0.5% and foreign orders fell by 4.2% in July 2019 on the previous month. New orders from the euro area were up 0.3%, new orders from other countries were down 6.7% compared to June 2019. The decline was felt across German industry, with capital goods orders down 3% and consumer goods orders down 2.4%. Just in: China\u2019s commerce ministry has told reporters that the overnight phone call with top US officials went \u201cvery well\u201d. Spokesman Gao Feng explained that China opposing escalation in the trade war, and will try to make \u201creal progress\u201d when they visit US in October. So far so good! But Gao also said that China hopes the US still stop taking \u201cwrong actions\u201d against Chinese companies (such as Huawei). Europe\u2019s stock markets have hit their highest levels in a month, lifted by trade war hopes. Here\u2019s the early moves: Germany\u2019s DAX: up 96 points at 12,121, up 0.8% French CAC: up 43 points at 5,576, up 0.8% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: up 100 points at 21,833, up 0.5% Technology companies and industrial firms, who are particularly vulnerable to trade conflict, are leading the rally. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the decision to restart trade talks \u201csent a rocket under equities globally\u201d. But he also advises caution, as we\u2019ve been here before.... On trade \u2013 we\u2019re getting more jaw jaw, but just as much war war as before. The news of face-to-face high-level talks between the US and China next month has been seen as a positive but needs to be taken with a good dose of salt. It wasn\u2019t that long ago the market was rallying as we thought a deal imminent, now it\u2019s moving on nothing more than confirmation of talks. It highlights the headline risk that traders must contend with and suggests there is very little by way of a strong trend in the markets right now, just a lot of short-termism and uncertainty. A trade deal is a long way away. The chances of a US-China trade deal anytime soon are thin, warns Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group. She suspects Donald Trump could be tempted to inflame the situation, to encourage US central bankers to cut interest rates. With only a slim chance of a trade deal, all investors ask is at least the continuation of the trade talks. It is uncertain whether Trump would attempt to cool down the trade war moving into the presidential election year, or he would continue fanning the flames and using it as a tool to exercise an increased pressure on the Federal Reserve for lower interest rates Japan\u2019s stock market has hit its highest level in a month, on hopes that the US-China trade war could be easing. In Beijing, every stock market sector rallied - led by technology companies (+2.1%), financial stocks (+1.4%) and consumer stocks (+1%). This lifted the Chinese market by around 1%. Traders are clearly welcoming the prospects of new face-to-face talks between the US and China soon. Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM, says \u201cseasoned investors\u201d will be cautious, though. Getting a deal will not be easy, at all. The lift in risk sentiment appears mitigated by the concern that the latest positive developments surrounding the US-China trade impasse may prove fleeting and do not yet fully nullify the downside risks to the global economy. In order for risk sentiment to push significantly higher, markets will need to be shown material signs that US and China are indeed drawing closer to a meaningful and lasting trade deal. Existing tariffs need to be dismantled in order to alleviate pressures on the global economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The clouds of gloom that have enveloped the markets recently are lifting this morning, as rays of optimism over the trade war break through. Overnight, America and China have agreed to restart face-to-face negotiations, in an attempt to defuse the trade war that is hurting the global economy. The breakthrough came following a call between China\u2019s vice-president Liu He and the US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin. Lighthizer\u2019s office announced: \u201cThey agreed to hold meetings at the ministerial level in Washington in the coming weeks. In advance of these discussions, deputy-level meetings will take place in mid-September to lay the ground work for meaningful progress. Crucially, China also announced the breakthrough, revealing that Beijing will send a delegation to Washington in early October. This is the first significant breakthrough since June, when Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed in principle to restart talks following the collapse of negotiations in May. Since then, both sides have imposed additional tariffs on their goods, raising concerns about an escalating trade war. Yesterday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the dispute was hurting the global economy, so investors will be hoping that October\u2019s talks actually happen, and deliver progress. Stocks have jumped in Asia overnight, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei gaining 2% and China\u2019s CSI 300 up 1%. European markets are expected to rally too, with the STOXX 600 called up almost 1%.

While this does happen every year, some areas have suffered far more than usual. In the worst-affected Brazilian state of Amazonas, the peak day for fires in August was 700% higher than the average for the same date over the past 15 years. In other states, the amount of ash and other particulates in the air in August has hit the highest level since 2010.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the cause?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Most of the fires are agricultural, either smallholders burning stubble after harvest, or farmers clearing forest for cropland. Illegal land-grabbers also destroy trees so they can raise the value of the property they seize. But they are manmade and mostly deliberate.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is the entire forest ablaze?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>No. Satellite monitoring experts say the images of an entire forest ablaze are exaggerated. A great deal of misinformation has been spread by social media, including the use of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://factcheck.afp.com/prayforamazonas-thousands-people-are-sharing-old-pictures-posts-about-amazon-rainforest-fires\">striking images from previous years\u2019 burning seasons</a>. This week, there are more large fires in Colombia and eastern Brazil than in the Amazon.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Do we need to worry about oxygen?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>No. Although some reports have claimed the Amazon produces 20% of the world\u2019s oxygen, it is not clear where this figure originated. The true figure is likely to be no more than 6%. Even if it were accurate, the crops being planted in the cleared forest areas would also produce oxygen. So although the burning of the rainforest is worrying for many reasons, there is no need to worry about an oxygen shortage.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So should we still be concerned?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Extremely. The fires are mostly illegal and they are degrading the world\u2019s biggest terrestrial carbon sink and most important home for biodiversity. They also contribute to a more important trend, which is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/brazil-amazon-rainforest-deforestation-environment\">an alarming rise</a>&nbsp;in deforestation. Scientists say the Amazon is approaching a tipping point, after which it will irreversibly degrade into a dry savannah. At a time when the world needs billions more trees to absorb carbon and stabilise the climate, the planet is losing its biggest rainforest.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanwatts\"><b>Jonathan Watts</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Preparations for an Amazon synod have been under way since 2016, but the issue has become more urgent in recent months due to fires, threats and a hostile government, Kr\u00e4utler said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere have always been fires in the Amazon.

But the action is hit-and-miss. There\u2019s an exceptionally good scene as Ne Zha fights off a sea monster that turns its enemies into stone. (The antidote involves a yucky, slimy bodily fluid.) If only the rest of the action sequences had the same energy and lightness of touch. Director Jiao Zi likes to pile it on, with bloodthirsty fight scenes thundering to a deafening chaotic climax. It probably helps to go in with a couple of paracetamols. \u2022 Ne Zha is released in the UK on 6 September.",

The latest Sats results are the continuation of trends seen for many years. In the UK, girls consistently outperform boys, with the exception of advanced maths-based subjects.

      "body": "<p>Receptionists, security guards, porters and postroom staff at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) in London have joined cleaners and caterers in striking for better pay and conditions, marking a significant escalation in the dispute.</p> <p>The workers are employed by the contractors ISS and Aramark, who run security, catering, cleaning and support services at BEIS.</p> <p>The cleaners and caterers have been on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/17/business-department-workers-continue-strike-action-better-pay\">indefinite strike since 15 July</a>. The security guards, porters and reception staff are on strike until 13 September, and will take rolling strike action in the form of one week on strike, one week off, from 30 September.</p> <p>The strikers are demanding the London living wage and sick pay. Some have been left in such a precarious financial situation that their union, the PCS, set up food bank donations inside the BEIS offices on Victoria Street.</p> <p>The PCS is calling for all contracted workers at government departments to be brought back in-house and to be paid a civil service wage.</p> <p>Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS, said: \u201cThis is a long-running strike and what we\u2019ve got here are people all working for private contractors being treated appallingly. They are demonstrating just how badly workers are treated in the public sector; they don\u2019t get the London wage and do jobs that are taken for granted. But they are determined to be treated properly and paid a living wage.\u201d</p> <p>The union said BEIS faced massive disruption as some catering facilities in the building are suspended and conference and staff entrances are closed.</p> <p>The cafe at BEIS is still providing hot and cold food, while cleaning services are still going ahead, with more intensive cleaning taking place out of office hours. While the staff-only entrance is closed, the two main entrances and exits remain open.</p> <p>Spirits were high on the noisy and vibrant picket line, where strikers sounded vuvuzelas and cheered when speakers demanded that the government and contractors paid workers a decent wage. One cleaner told the crowd: \u201cI\u2019ve been told the building is disgusting. It\u2019s dirty, people cannot even go to the toilet because it\u2019s dirty. My colleagues from cleaners, when we win, we have a lot of work to do.\u201d</p> <p>Mary, 42, who did not wish to give her real name, has been working as a caterer at BEIS for the past 12 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the security guards join us, then the receptionists, and so on. I feel more powerful. The more people who join, the more they feel it in there,\u201d she said, pointing at the BEIS building. She added the lack of sick pay has meant she is forced to come in when she is unwell because she cannot afford to miss a day\u2019s wage. <br><br>Tony, 47, who also did not wish to give his real name, has worked as a security guard at BEIS for 16 years. \u201cIn that time period, I\u2019ve had a pay rise of about \u00a32.50,\u201d he said. \u201cThis government department said they\u2019d implement a London living wage, so why am I here today? I am not getting the living wage and I\u2019ve got five children.\u201d He said he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to win the living wage and sick pay.</p> <p>Rebecca Long-Bailey<em>, </em>the shadow secretary of state for business, said: \u201cThe one department that is supposed to be responsible for workers\u2019 rights is treating its workers abysmally.\u201d She added that such disputes would be at the heart of the upcoming general election.</p> <p>She told the crowd at the picket on Thursday morning: \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re out on strike in front of this department, that\u2019s supposed to be a beacon across the world, is absolute shambles. It\u2019s shameful. But remember this, you\u2019re not just striking for people in this department, you\u2019re acting as an inspiration for people up and down the country.\u201d</p> <p>A BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cWe value all of our staff at BEIS and our priority is to ensure they receive a fair wage for their hard work, whether directly employed or working for our contractors.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for ISS said: \u201cThis is a long-running dispute that predates ISS taking over the contract at BEIS, with employee terms and conditions remaining unchanged from those offered by the previous contractor. We offer pay levels at the median rate for each profession, as identified in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Aramark said: \u201cWe are disappointed that workers continue to strike as, throughout this dispute, we have made concessions and offered improvements to both salary levels and terms and conditions and have ensured staff are paid in line with the median rates for those professions as outlined in the Annual Survey of Earnings. Increased rates were paid to staff from 1 March with the lowest paid team members receiving a 15% increase in pay. Aramark employees are paid statutory sick pay in accordance with their terms of employment.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Receptionists, security guards, porters and postroom staff at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) in London have joined cleaners and caterers in striking for better pay and conditions, marking a significant escalation in the dispute. The workers are employed by the contractors ISS and Aramark, who run security, catering, cleaning and support services at BEIS. The cleaners and caterers have been on indefinite strike since 15 July. The security guards, porters and reception staff are on strike until 13 September, and will take rolling strike action in the form of one week on strike, one week off, from 30 September. The strikers are demanding the London living wage and sick pay. Some have been left in such a precarious financial situation that their union, the PCS, set up food bank donations inside the BEIS offices on Victoria Street. The PCS is calling for all contracted workers at government departments to be brought back in-house and to be paid a civil service wage. Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS, said: \u201cThis is a long-running strike and what we\u2019ve got here are people all working for private contractors being treated appallingly. They are demonstrating just how badly workers are treated in the public sector; they don\u2019t get the London wage and do jobs that are taken for granted. But they are determined to be treated properly and paid a living wage.\u201d The union said BEIS faced massive disruption as some catering facilities in the building are suspended and conference and staff entrances are closed. The cafe at BEIS is still providing hot and cold food, while cleaning services are still going ahead, with more intensive cleaning taking place out of office hours. While the staff-only entrance is closed, the two main entrances and exits remain open. Spirits were high on the noisy and vibrant picket line, where strikers sounded vuvuzelas and cheered when speakers demanded that the government and contractors paid workers a decent wage. One cleaner told the crowd: \u201cI\u2019ve been told the building is disgusting. It\u2019s dirty, people cannot even go to the toilet because it\u2019s dirty. My colleagues from cleaners, when we win, we have a lot of work to do.\u201d Mary, 42, who did not wish to give her real name, has been working as a caterer at BEIS for the past 12 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the security guards join us, then the receptionists, and so on. I feel more powerful. The more people who join, the more they feel it in there,\u201d she said, pointing at the BEIS building. She added the lack of sick pay has meant she is forced to come in when she is unwell because she cannot afford to miss a day\u2019s wage. Tony, 47, who also did not wish to give his real name, has worked as a security guard at BEIS for 16 years. \u201cIn that time period, I\u2019ve had a pay rise of about \u00a32.50,\u201d he said. \u201cThis government department said they\u2019d implement a London living wage, so why am I here today? I am not getting the living wage and I\u2019ve got five children.\u201d He said he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to win the living wage and sick pay. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow secretary of state for business, said: \u201cThe one department that is supposed to be responsible for workers\u2019 rights is treating its workers abysmally.\u201d She added that such disputes would be at the heart of the upcoming general election. She told the crowd at the picket on Thursday morning: \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re out on strike in front of this department, that\u2019s supposed to be a beacon across the world, is absolute shambles. It\u2019s shameful. But remember this, you\u2019re not just striking for people in this department, you\u2019re acting as an inspiration for people up and down the country.\u201d A BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cWe value all of our staff at BEIS and our priority is to ensure they receive a fair wage for their hard work, whether directly employed or working for our contractors.\u201d A spokesperson for ISS said: \u201cThis is a long-running dispute that predates ISS taking over the contract at BEIS, with employee terms and conditions remaining unchanged from those offered by the previous contractor. We offer pay levels at the median rate for each profession, as identified in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings.\u201d A spokesperson for Aramark said: \u201cWe are disappointed that workers continue to strike as, throughout this dispute, we have made concessions and offered improvements to both salary levels and terms and conditions and have ensured staff are paid in line with the median rates for those professions as outlined in the Annual Survey of Earnings. Increased rates were paid to staff from 1 March with the lowest paid team members receiving a 15% increase in pay. Aramark employees are paid statutory sick pay in accordance with their terms of employment.\u201d",

Or, if the bill reaches royal assent and there is pressure on Johnson to request a delay, he could simply refuse and see what his critics do. Launch a legal challenge? Perhaps. But the one thing Downing Street is adamant about is that Johnson will not request a Brexit delay in any shape or form. Should push come to shove, the prime minister could resign rather than go through with it. Johnson could suggest that the Queen ask Corbyn to request and sign any extension, thereby putting pressure on the remain alliance, and highlighting rifts over a so-called government of national unity. Such a move would also be seized on by Tories in an eventual election as proof Corbyn was against Brexit. In the topsy-turvy world of Brexit, the unthinkable is now possible. \u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor",

The House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has previously objected to the same motion being put forward twice when Theresa May attempted to submit her Brexit deal on multiple occasions, but Number 10 believes it will be permitted because of the no-deal bill receiving royal assent, a material change of circumstances. Should the plan fail, Johnson will be faced with the difficult dilemma of trying to force an election using a different route which requires only a simple majority \u2013 either a one-line bill to amend the FTPA or calling a no-confidence vote in his own government. \u201cThe prime minister believes, as he set out last night, that the public must be given a say before the European council on the 17 October,\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokeswoman said. There is no guarantee that Labour will back the government\u2019s plan for an election when it returns on Monday. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said there are \u201cdifferent views\u201d in Labour about the timing of an election and said the party was \u201cconsulting about whether it\u2019s better to go long rather than to go short\u201d. He said the party was \u201ctaking legal advice on how secure that bill is, but we\u2019re also consulting the other opposition parties, and our own party on the date of a general election\u201d. Senior Labour figures, including Keir Starmer, have suggested that the election should not take place until the extension to Brexit has been secured, to ensure Johnson cannot repeal the legislation against no deal. A Downing Street source said the prime minister would under no circumstances go to Brussels to request an extension beyond the October deadline. \u201cIt will never, ever, ever happen, we will never do it and so eventually we will get an election,\u201d the source said. \u201cWatch Labour\u2019s polling drop off a cliff when the country sees what they are trying to do.\u201d However, a number of Labour MPs feel strongly that the party should again block the plans. A Labour source said: \u201cThere are just a handful of MPs who are feeling gung-ho and want to back a general election soon but a lot of MPs are feeling really nervous. \u201cThe strong feeling among MPs is we shouldn\u2019t fall into the trap next week either if there\u2019s another vote on a general election. Most Labour MPs are adamant they do not want an election before 31 October.\u201d The Labour MP Wes Streeting said: \u201cOur number one priority is stopping a no-deal Brexit happening during a general election campaign through accident or design. We don\u2019t trust Boris Johnson and nor should anyone else. Once we are confident that no deal is safely ruled out, we will all troop through to vote for a general election, which is now necessary, inevitable and desirable.\u201d His fellow Labour MP Andy Slaughter said he would vote against or abstain in a second government vote called to try to bring about an election, unless he could get a \u201ccopper-bottomed guarantee\u201d that the anti-no deal legislation tabled by the government would be adhered to.",

      "bodyText": "The competition watchdog has suspended court proceedings against the ticketing website Viagogo, saying the company had made changes that addressed concerns the site was flouting laws designed to protect UK consumers. However, critics of Viagogo immediately questioned the \u201csurprising\u201d decision and said concerns about the website\u2019s business practices had not yet been put to rest. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) was seeking to have Viagogo found in contempt of court for persistently failing to comply with consumer law when selling tickets for concerts by artists such as Ed Sheeran, who has previously clashed with the site. The regulator had complained Viagogo was not doing enough to inform buyers they could be turned away from events at which the artist, venue or promoter was refusing entry to people who had bought tickets from resale sites. The company was also publishing \u201cmisleading\u201d information about the number of tickets available, it said, while some seat numbers were not being displayed on ticket listings. The regulator\u2019s complaints were among factors that led Google to ban Viagogo from paying to appear in adverts at the top of search results. The CMA said on Thursday that Viagogo had made enough changes to the website that it no longer needed to pursue the legal action. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe Viagogo website UK customers now visit is worlds apart from the one they faced before the CMA took action. Key information needed to make informed decisions before buying a ticket is now much clearer, including where you\u2019ll sit in a venue and whether you might be turned away at the door.\u201d He said the challenges faced by the CMA in forcing Viagogo to comply had strengthened its argument that it needed stronger enforcement powers, such as the ability to impose fines. \u201cWhat is clearly not acceptable is the time it\u2019s taken to get to this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cStronger consumer powers are required in the secondary ticketing sector and we will continue to work with the government on the most effective way to achieve this. A Viagogo spokesperson said: \u201cViagogo is pleased it has been able to work with the CMA to find solutions to the final few areas of discussion, as confirmed by today\u2019s statement. \u201cWe have strived at all times to ensure we are correctly applying the CMA order, this has been a complex and detailed process, and open dialogue with the market authority has been essential.\u201d The Labour MP Sharon Hodgson said the CMA\u2019s decision was a surprising \u201cbackwards step\u201d, adding that Viagogo had made only \u201cvanity changes\u201d to its site. \u201cI will be writing to the CMA and the government minister about this issue to put pressure on them to keep this issue under serious review and urge them to step in immediately if further evidence against Viagogo comes to light,\u201d she said. The music industry group FanFair Alliance said that while Viagogo was more transparent than it used to be, it was still not treating consumers fairly, accusing the CMA of \u201cnot finishing the job\u201d. The group said: \u201cLeaving aside its historic abuses of UK audiences, which are serious, extensive and well documented, we continue to hold serious concerns that Viagogo remains noncompliant with a range of consumer protection laws. \u201cWe continue to share these concerns with the CMA on a regular basis.\u201d The ticket touting expert Reg Walker, of the Iridium Consultancy, said: \u201cIt is incredible that Viagogo, once again, have escaped being held to account for flouting UK consumer protection legislation. \u201dAfter a two-year investigation, with thousands of examples of listings that break consumer protection legislation, the CMA, despite spending some \u00a32m of taxpayers\u2019 money, has let Viagogo off the hook. \u201cI cannot begin to imagine how galling this must be for the tens of thousands of victims of Viagogo who have yet to receive justice.\u201d",

</p> <p>Before he became a flipping household name as the painfully geeky Maurice Moss in The IT Crowd, the world has owed the actor, writer, director and flaneur a great debt. Since 2000, in fact, when he and Matthew Holness created spoof horror author Garth Marenghi, who\u2019d transition from Edinburgh stage to Channel 4 show (all the while penning books like Afterbirth, in which a mutated placenta attacks Bristol, and Black Fang, which asks the question: what if a rat could drive a bus?)</p> <p>Ever since, Ayoade has appeared in everything from The Mighty Boosh (as the belligerent shaman Saboo) to Danger Mouse (an evil snowman). He has presented every TV show, from the rebooted The Crystal Maze to his celebrity adventures on Travel Man. He has also directed everything from music videos (for bands like Arctic Monkeys, Radiohead and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) to feature films (his 2011 debut Submarine and a film of Dostoevsky\u2019s The Double in 2014). And now the pinnacle of his career: joining us for a webchat on <strong>Thursday 5 September at 12pm BST.</strong></p> <p>His latest project is a book called <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ayoade-on-top-9780571339136.html\">Ayoade On Top</a>, a sort-of-memoir-cum-ode to the film <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2003/11/21/gwyneth-paltrow-her-worst-movie-ever/\">Gwyneth Paltrow once called the worst she\u2019s ever been in</a>: View From the Top, in which Ayoade argues for the canonisation of \u201cthis brutal masterpiece\u201d. </p> <p>Ayoade on Top is published by Faber on 5 September.

OwenGuehl asks: Could you please select your most appealing responses from the following: \u2013What is your favourite film noir? \u2013Your favourite Kurosawa? \u2013Of Davids Mamet, Cronenberg and Lynch, whose films do you appreciate the most/least? \u2013Which do you consider the most re-watchable film in history? omwjmo asks: In The Souvenir whose decision was it for you not to wear glasses? Could you see what was going on? shoaibsalam asks: You\u2019ve directed a video for the Arctic Monkeys so clearly you have good taste in music. Who\u2019s the greatest band to come out of Manchester? Karanips asks: Would you be able to give us some insight into how you worked with Alex Turner on the Submarine soundtrack? Up4grabs asks: Richard, that stabbing between the fingers thing on the IT crowd. Was it for real? hughfrancis asks: Do you miss Ipswich? Saul Barrett asks: What are your fondest memories of your time studying at Cambridge? And what would you do differently if you could live it all over again? Amongtheflowers asks: What\u2019s your favourite childhood memory? LouiseofTO asks: I would like to ask you about whether you have had to strike a balance between the demands of the life of an artist and those of parenthood, and whether your absence from directing over the past five years is in any way related to the demands of having a young family. I\u2019ve read several comments from you about not wanting to be far from home because of your children, and I wonder why that is the reason you have been primarily presenting, appearing as a quiz show guest, and writing books in the last five years or so. Not to say that your performances aren\u2019t wonderful in these roles. But after your screenwriting and directing in Submarine and The Double revealed the extraordinarily breadth of your artistic talent, critics and film fans have been looking forward to your next film project. I hope this enquiry hasn\u2019t been too personal in nature. Please accept my heartfelt thanks for all your work, and my best wishes for your future happiness and artistic fulfilment. bambam75 asks: What would you be doing if you weren\u2019t doing telly and stuff? ImNotYourBroom asks; What is your least favourite film genre? TheRealDonRobinho asks: What\u2019s your favourite flavour of crisps? Ansapo asks: I am flying all the way from Albuquerque to see your interview at the Southbank Centre. My question: When you directed the most perfect television episode, ever, the US sitcom Community episode, which perfectly parodied both Pulp Fiction and My Dinner With Andre, did you watch the films immediately prior to directing the episode, or do it from memory? I don\u2019t know why I want to know this. I guess I just wanted to sound smart. ncfcyellowman asks: We live in dark times. In the US, Trump \u2018s relentless assault on democracy and decency shows no sign of abating. Here, democracy is being threatened by a right wing coup orchestrated by a group of privileged elite shitbags determined to return the country to the 16th century. With this in mind, so you think it\u2019s ever ok to wear courduroy with denim? \u2018DO you think\u2019, not \u2018so you think\u2019. Honestly. Bloody predunctive tuxt. Steph Avery Reynolds asks: You have a charming eccentricity that is hugely comforting in these dour days. Were you an eccentric child? Is your unique style inherent or an effort? I\u2019m asking as the mother of an eccentric teenager* who sees a kindred spirit in you - and it would be good to hear you have always been thus. Ps, *favourite book - The Grip of Film. jamiepk asks: Less a question and more a plea for forgiveness. You may not remember this, but about 10 years ago a friend of yours had a baby (which I suspect you do remember). You came to the Hospital I worked at, when I had just been promoted to a job looking after the Maternity ward. Anyway, there had been a breakout of some sort of unpleasantness and we had to limit visitors into the ward to 2 people per baby. You arrived with someone during visiting hours and asked to go in and see your friend. I seem to recall being all embarrassed - being a massive fan of Darkplace - and mumbling something or another about \u2018sick babies\u2019 and \u2018diseases\u2019 (I really was far too young for my job at the time). Ten years on and I can genuinely say that whenever I see you on TV or hear you on a podcast, I cringe with embarrassment. Which is obviously ridiculous, but true. Anja Sol asks: 1. I loved Submarine and The Double - any upcoming film plans? 2. As a huge film buff, do you enjoy going to the cinema? Or like a lot of people do get easily annoyed by all the terrible etiquette? You seem like the type to be easily annoyed by terrible etiquette. 3. How about a Top 10 of your favourite films? In order! matthew_ asks: I once worked at the Prince Charles Cinema in Leicester Square and, in about 2004, I gave you a complementary ticket. Do you remember and are you still grateful? Richard is with us now! Is there another actor who could deliver the line, \u201cI came here to drink milk and kick ass, and I\u2019ve just finished my milk\u201d with as much deadpan aplomb as Richard Ayoade? Before he became a flipping household name as the painfully geeky Maurice Moss in The IT Crowd, the world has owed the actor, writer, director and flaneur a great debt. Since 2000, in fact, when he and Matthew Holness created spoof horror author Garth Marenghi, who\u2019d transition from Edinburgh stage to Channel 4 show (all the while penning books like Afterbirth, in which a mutated placenta attacks Bristol, and Black Fang, which asks the question: what if a rat could drive a bus?) Ever since, Ayoade has appeared in everything from The Mighty Boosh (as the belligerent shaman Saboo) to Danger Mouse (an evil snowman). He has presented every TV show, from the rebooted The Crystal Maze to his celebrity adventures on Travel Man. He has also directed everything from music videos (for bands like Arctic Monkeys, Radiohead and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) to feature films (his 2011 debut Submarine and a film of Dostoevsky\u2019s The Double in 2014). And now the pinnacle of his career: joining us for a webchat on Thursday 5 September at 12pm BST. His latest project is a book called Ayoade On Top, a sort-of-memoir-cum-ode to the film Gwyneth Paltrow once called the worst she\u2019s ever been in: View From the Top, in which Ayoade argues for the canonisation of \u201cthis brutal masterpiece\u201d. Ayoade on Top is published by Faber on 5 September. Post your questions for Richard in the comments section below.",

      "body": "<p>Forty years ago, the BBC broadcast its adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2016/sep/03/tinker-tailor-writer-spy-the-many-lives-of-john-le-carre-in-his-own-words\">John Le Carr\u00e9</a> novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for the first time. Starring Sir Alec Guinness as George Smiley, the master spy hunting down a Soviet mole in the British intelligence services, it provoked controversy. Largely over whether it made any sense or not.</p> <p>While Nancy Banks-Smith, in her review for the Guardian, called Tinker Tailor \u201cthe very best caviar\u201d, Clive James in the Observer was of a different mind. \u201cThe first instalment,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfully lived up to the standard set by the original novel. Though not quite as incomprehensible, it was equally turgid.\u201d</p> <p>You get the feeling, from the way James begrudgingly warmed to the drama as it ran its course (\u201cAnything can improve,\u201d he wrote, \u201ceven Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, of which the latest episode was a good deal less wearisome than the previous three\u201d), that some of the invective was for effect. But he was not alone in finding the material challenging. Working out whether you had a clue what was going on in Tinker Tailor became something of a national pastime. Larry Grayson even joked about it in the Generation Game.</p> <p>In 2019, it is not just the bluffs and double bluffs (and treble and quadruple bluffs) that viewers might find baffling. It is the world in which the drama is set, the way its inhabitants behave and what \u2013 if anything \u2013 they believe in. Tinker Tailor very much remains TV caviar. But it is also, from today\u2019s vantage point, a remarkable insight into a different time, one that itself offered a window on to another, dying world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cd01937fc7cd1044fd011937ced5a38d08c6725\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cd01937fc7cd1044fd011937ced5a38d08c6725/0_111_2308_1384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terence Rigby and Alec Guinness in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terence Rigby and Alec Guinness in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tinker Tailor\u2019s director, John Irvin, now 79, is one of the few people still alive who was involved in the production. His understanding of what the story required, he says, was filtered through values born of empire. \u201cWhat we wanted to reveal dramatically was the complexity of the secret state,\u201d he says. \u201cThe contradictions, the betrayals of loyalty. The aspect that I latched on to, I think, the one I felt personally, was the idea of service. Christian service and service to country. How that sense of Christian service could be corrupted into the most mendacious and reckless behaviour was something I was preoccupied with throughout the telling of the story.\u201d</p> <p>While we are still living in a Britain ruled by public school elites, this aristocratic concept of service would appear long gone. In 2019, it is a struggle to find anyone articulating a case for \u201cdoing good\u201d, even disingenuously. Tinker Tailor may be a story about betrayal, the hunt for a mole at the heart of MI6, but it occurs in a world defined by rules and procedures. In the modern era, with all its disruption and executive action, that seems odd. A final jarring dissonance between Smiley\u2019s world and ours is the aesthetic of it all, the drab locations and sallow flesh. It depicts a country wearing its decline on its sleeve. Our contemporary age would never admit to as much (and indeed it did not in the 2011 film version, where everything was carefully stylised and in the colour scheme of a 70s sitcom). </p> <p>Watching Tinker Tailor today, you feel teleported: you get the thrill of watching something that is complex, that you can\u2019t quite make sense of but desperately wish to. (In 1979, the debate over Tinker Tailor\u2019s complexity continued into the Guardian\u2019s letters pages, with the counterpoint to the Larry Grayson position being articulated by a Dr Graham Nicholls, who made the case that \u201cPeople love being mystified\u201d.)</p> <p>You also get to watch something that is slow and often silent, and all the more powerful for that. \u201cArthur [Hopcraft] in his dialogue left a lot of space for silence,\u201d says Irvin of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/nov/26/football.guardianobituaries\">celebrated Guardian journalist</a> who went on to a brief but glittering career as a screenwriter. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like working with Pinter, where it was deliberate, but it gave a chance to see what\u2019s going on behind the mask. A spy story is a succession of masks. It\u2019s poker \u2013 the silence is when you are trying to read the other\u2019s mind. If people talk a lot, they\u2019re not going to be very good spies. The trick was in timing the silence so that you don\u2019t overdo it and it becomes tedious, but leaving it long enough that it became tantalising.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ced72399eb7acf0f1712f05a62e86a559145e46e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ced72399eb7acf0f1712f05a62e86a559145e46e/0_105_2132_1279/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those moments worked as Irvin hoped, and form the centre of Tinker, Tailor. They are like the extended interrogations in Line of Duty, except the tension is more drawn out and there are more gaps the viewer is encouraged to fill. Those interrogations would not have been remotely as effective, however, had they not featured one of the greatest acting performances ever delivered on the small screen.</p> <p>Sir Alec Guinness, it was suggested at the time, was able to play Smiley because he was rolling in Star Wars money. His reluctance to take the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi had led him to ask for 2% of the film\u2019s box office takings. That turned out to be a smart move and allowed Guinness some latitude in selecting his next roles. According to Irvin, however, that did not mean he leapt at the prospect of Tinker, Tailor. \u201cHe needed three lunches with me and certainly a lunch with David [Cornwell, AKA John Le Carr\u00e9] and the head of MI6 to be convinced that he would commit.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually he did commit, and Guinness set about fully engaging with a character he described to the Guardian at the time as being \u201ca vulnerable man who \u2026 is capable of taking unexpectedly swift and rather harsh action\u201d.</p> <p>For Irvin, working with Guinness was \u201ca deep, creative partnership\u201d, but it had its strengths and weaknesses. Guinness\u2019s pull meant that the supporting cast \u2013 from Ian Richardson to Beryl Reid \u2013 were easy to acquire. Requiring more time and patience, however, was Guinness himself.</p> <p>\u201cLike a lot of great artists, there were moments of great insecurity,\u201d Irvin says. \u201cHe rang me at four o\u2019clock in the morning on a Sunday before a shoot, saying that he hadn\u2019t really found George Smiley and that it would be much better if we just recast. He also said that he couldn\u2019t put on any more weight, he didn\u2019t feel right.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was a provocation or not, but this made me quite angry. I said: \u2018It\u2019s not about the size of George Smiley\u2019s tummy; it\u2019s about the size of his massive brain, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u2019 We were about to shoot in two hours, so I said: \u2018Let\u2019s go back to sleep, we\u2019ve got to get some rest.\u2019 A little later I arrive at Primrose Hill and he\u2019s standing entirely alone in an overcoat and bowler hat, ready to shoot the scene. Any hint of that insecurity had entirely gone.\u201d</p> <p>Guinness\u2019s insecurity existed alongside the confidence to insist the UK\u2019s chief spy dine with him before he accepted the job. And the same stark contrast is at work in Smiley, too. A paunchy, aged cuckold who looks too frail even to leave his chair, he is capable of plumbing the depths of the human psyche and confronting them.</p> <p>The contradiction within Smiley served as a reminder that human beings are complicated things, and this complexity is the heart of what makes Tinker Tailor one of the best dramas of the TV age. A lot has changed in the years since it was made, but not that.</p> <p><em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is now available to buy on Blu-Ray from BBC Studios</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Forty years ago, the BBC broadcast its adaptation of the John Le Carr\u00e9 novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for the first time. Starring Sir Alec Guinness as George Smiley, the master spy hunting down a Soviet mole in the British intelligence services, it provoked controversy. Largely over whether it made any sense or not. While Nancy Banks-Smith, in her review for the Guardian, called Tinker Tailor \u201cthe very best caviar\u201d, Clive James in the Observer was of a different mind. \u201cThe first instalment,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfully lived up to the standard set by the original novel. Though not quite as incomprehensible, it was equally turgid.\u201d You get the feeling, from the way James begrudgingly warmed to the drama as it ran its course (\u201cAnything can improve,\u201d he wrote, \u201ceven Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, of which the latest episode was a good deal less wearisome than the previous three\u201d), that some of the invective was for effect. But he was not alone in finding the material challenging. Working out whether you had a clue what was going on in Tinker Tailor became something of a national pastime. Larry Grayson even joked about it in the Generation Game. In 2019, it is not just the bluffs and double bluffs (and treble and quadruple bluffs) that viewers might find baffling. It is the world in which the drama is set, the way its inhabitants behave and what \u2013 if anything \u2013 they believe in. Tinker Tailor very much remains TV caviar. But it is also, from today\u2019s vantage point, a remarkable insight into a different time, one that itself offered a window on to another, dying world. Tinker Tailor\u2019s director, John Irvin, now 79, is one of the few people still alive who was involved in the production. His understanding of what the story required, he says, was filtered through values born of empire. \u201cWhat we wanted to reveal dramatically was the complexity of the secret state,\u201d he says. \u201cThe contradictions, the betrayals of loyalty. The aspect that I latched on to, I think, the one I felt personally, was the idea of service. Christian service and service to country. How that sense of Christian service could be corrupted into the most mendacious and reckless behaviour was something I was preoccupied with throughout the telling of the story.\u201d While we are still living in a Britain ruled by public school elites, this aristocratic concept of service would appear long gone. In 2019, it is a struggle to find anyone articulating a case for \u201cdoing good\u201d, even disingenuously. Tinker Tailor may be a story about betrayal, the hunt for a mole at the heart of MI6, but it occurs in a world defined by rules and procedures. In the modern era, with all its disruption and executive action, that seems odd. A final jarring dissonance between Smiley\u2019s world and ours is the aesthetic of it all, the drab locations and sallow flesh. It depicts a country wearing its decline on its sleeve. Our contemporary age would never admit to as much (and indeed it did not in the 2011 film version, where everything was carefully stylised and in the colour scheme of a 70s sitcom). Watching Tinker Tailor today, you feel teleported: you get the thrill of watching something that is complex, that you can\u2019t quite make sense of but desperately wish to. (In 1979, the debate over Tinker Tailor\u2019s complexity continued into the Guardian\u2019s letters pages, with the counterpoint to the Larry Grayson position being articulated by a Dr Graham Nicholls, who made the case that \u201cPeople love being mystified\u201d.) You also get to watch something that is slow and often silent, and all the more powerful for that. \u201cArthur [Hopcraft] in his dialogue left a lot of space for silence,\u201d says Irvin of the celebrated Guardian journalist who went on to a brief but glittering career as a screenwriter. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like working with Pinter, where it was deliberate, but it gave a chance to see what\u2019s going on behind the mask. A spy story is a succession of masks. It\u2019s poker \u2013 the silence is when you are trying to read the other\u2019s mind. If people talk a lot, they\u2019re not going to be very good spies. The trick was in timing the silence so that you don\u2019t overdo it and it becomes tedious, but leaving it long enough that it became tantalising.\u201d Those moments worked as Irvin hoped, and form the centre of Tinker, Tailor. They are like the extended interrogations in Line of Duty, except the tension is more drawn out and there are more gaps the viewer is encouraged to fill. Those interrogations would not have been remotely as effective, however, had they not featured one of the greatest acting performances ever delivered on the small screen. Sir Alec Guinness, it was suggested at the time, was able to play Smiley because he was rolling in Star Wars money. His reluctance to take the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi had led him to ask for 2% of the film\u2019s box office takings. That turned out to be a smart move and allowed Guinness some latitude in selecting his next roles. According to Irvin, however, that did not mean he leapt at the prospect of Tinker, Tailor. \u201cHe needed three lunches with me and certainly a lunch with David [Cornwell, AKA John Le Carr\u00e9] and the head of MI6 to be convinced that he would commit.\u201d Eventually he did commit, and Guinness set about fully engaging with a character he described to the Guardian at the time as being \u201ca vulnerable man who \u2026 is capable of taking unexpectedly swift and rather harsh action\u201d. For Irvin, working with Guinness was \u201ca deep, creative partnership\u201d, but it had its strengths and weaknesses. Guinness\u2019s pull meant that the supporting cast \u2013 from Ian Richardson to Beryl Reid \u2013 were easy to acquire. Requiring more time and patience, however, was Guinness himself. \u201cLike a lot of great artists, there were moments of great insecurity,\u201d Irvin says. \u201cHe rang me at four o\u2019clock in the morning on a Sunday before a shoot, saying that he hadn\u2019t really found George Smiley and that it would be much better if we just recast. He also said that he couldn\u2019t put on any more weight, he didn\u2019t feel right. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was a provocation or not, but this made me quite angry. I said: \u2018It\u2019s not about the size of George Smiley\u2019s tummy; it\u2019s about the size of his massive brain, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u2019 We were about to shoot in two hours, so I said: \u2018Let\u2019s go back to sleep, we\u2019ve got to get some rest.\u2019 A little later I arrive at Primrose Hill and he\u2019s standing entirely alone in an overcoat and bowler hat, ready to shoot the scene. Any hint of that insecurity had entirely gone.\u201d Guinness\u2019s insecurity existed alongside the confidence to insist the UK\u2019s chief spy dine with him before he accepted the job. And the same stark contrast is at work in Smiley, too. A paunchy, aged cuckold who looks too frail even to leave his chair, he is capable of plumbing the depths of the human psyche and confronting them. The contradiction within Smiley served as a reminder that human beings are complicated things, and this complexity is the heart of what makes Tinker Tailor one of the best dramas of the TV age. A lot has changed in the years since it was made, but not that. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is now available to buy on Blu-Ray from BBC Studios",

Sister Act (1992)<br></h2> \n<p>Maggie Smith plays the authoritarian Mother Superior in this nuntastic box-office smash with a hint of Some Like It Hot, featuring Whoopi Goldberg as the lounge singer forced to go into a witness protection and join a convent after witnessing a mob slaying. There is some poignancy and dramatic edge to Smith\u2019s disapproving mien.</p> \n<h2>19. <strong>The Last September (1999)</strong></h2> \n<p>Before Downton and Gosford Park, there was this \u201ccountry house\u201d role for Maggie Smith, with John Banville\u2019s adaptation of Elizabeth Bowen\u2019s novel set in 1920s Ireland as the Anglo-Irish ascendancy becomes the descendancy. With subtle melancholy and restraint, Smith plays Lady Naylor, presiding over an estate in County Cork that feels increasingly embattled as Ireland prepares to break free of the British.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ba26482e7b96e756598716cbeb1b3c959cd0395\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ba26482e7b96e756598716cbeb1b3c959cd0395/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smith with Judi Dench in A Room With A View.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smith with Judi Dench in A Room With A View.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>18. <strong>A Room With a View (1985)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Smith plays Charlotte Bartlett in Ruth Prawer Jhabvala\u2019s adaptation of EM Forster\u2019s novel, directed by James Ivory. It is a small, but rather potent part as the wary and disapproving chaperone to her yearning younger cousin Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter), as they tour primly around Italy, fetching up in Florence. Charlotte is annoyed that their rooms do not have a \u201cview\u201d of the Arno, and her character epitomises the ironic inability to see the passionate possibilities laid out before her.</p> \n<h2>17. <strong>Young Cassidy (1965)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Based on the life of the great dramatist Sean O\u2019Casey, this movie has the Australian star Rod Taylor as the man himself and Smith as the demure librarian who falls for him, inspires his creative and theatrical career and then selflessly lets him fly free of her. A conventional romantic turn.</p> \n<h2>16. <strong>Ladies in Lavender (2004)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Very often, Smith finds herself in Werther\u2019s Original movies in which she is condescendingly required to be a feisty oldster. This period drama is a cut above. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/18/every-judi-dench-film-ranked\" title=\"\">Judi Dench</a> and Smith play two sisters living on the Cornish coast in the 1930s who take in a mysterious Polish stranger. His handsome brooding looks unlock dormant emotions in them both. A strong, yet nuanced performance from Smith.</p> \n<h2>15. <strong>Quartet (1981) </strong><br></h2> \n<p>A complex, unrelatable role for Smith in Jhabvala\u2019s cool, measured adaptation of the Jean Rhys novel, directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/27/james-ivory-ismail-merchant-love-secret-call-me-by-your-name-nudity\" title=\"\">Ivory</a>. She plays Lois, a painter in 1920s Paris, married to a handsome art dealer (Alan Bates), a philanderer who invites a beautiful penniless young woman (Isabelle Adjani) to stay with them \u2013 for the purposes of seducing her. Lois has to become resentfully complicit in this dysfunctional non-love triangle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"277aee905f245f35e3d88ca2db020c9216524f66\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/277aee905f245f35e3d88ca2db020c9216524f66/0_0_2848_2091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sexually voracious \u2026 Smith angles for a night of passion with a vicar (Michael Palin) in The Missionary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"734\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sexually voracious \u2026 Smith angles for a night of passion with a vicar (Michael Palin) in The Missionary.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Handmade Films</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>14. <strong>The Missionary (1982)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>An eccentric comedy from George Harrison\u2019s Handmade Films is the first of two pairings for Smith and the film\u2019s screenwriter-star Michael Palin. He is the unworldly clergyman tasked with setting up a mission for \u201cfallen women\u201d in Edwardian London\u2019s East End. Smith is the sexually voracious Lady Isabel Ames, to whose wealthy husband the vicar must apply for charitable funding. Lady Isabel effectively promises to open her husband\u2019s chequebook in return for a night of passion with the handsome vicar.</p> \n<h2><strong>13. Richard III (1995)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>A rare but special Shakespeare on screen for Smith, who plays the hated hunchback king\u2019s mother, the Duchess of York, opposite Ian McKellen\u2019s Richard in Richard Loncraine\u2019s Mosleyite-fascist staging. In some ways, it is another grande dame outing, but Smith brings to it a fierce energy and alienated anger \u2013 with a style perhaps borrowed from <a href=\"https://www.biography.com/royalty/mary-of-teck\" title=\"\">Queen Mary </a><a href=\"https://www.biography.com/royalty/mary-of-teck\" title=\"\">of Teck</a>.</p> \n<h2>12. <strong>Travels With My Aunt (1972)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>This was the film, adapted from Graham Greene and directed by George Cukor, in which Smith first established her Wilde-Wodehousian \u201caunt\u201d persona: at just 38 years old, she is playing a formidable old lady of around twice that age. It is a wacky adventure mystery in which Alec McCowen plays a bewildered chap who finds himself finagled by his mysterious Aunt Augusta (Smith) into her plan to rescue her former lover from a kidnap plot. A broad comic performance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"59be3f32f244e83c974a09428587fcea5784ba7c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59be3f32f244e83c974a09428587fcea5784ba7c/0_0_1947_1607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wronged love \u2026 as Desdemona in Othello.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"825\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wronged love \u2026 as Desdemona in Othello.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Allstar/Warner Bros</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>11. <strong>Othello (1965)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Smith held her own against one of the biggest alpha-gorillas of stage or screen, Laurence Olivier. In that distant age, he played Shakespeare\u2019s Othello in blackface and with a rolling, booming bass voice, while Smith played his wronged love, Desdemona, with mellifluous dignity and grace.</p> \n<h2>10. <strong>Washington Square (1997)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Smith gives one of her blue-chip \u201caunt\u201d performances in this excellent, underrated and under-remembered Henry James adaptation, directed by Agnieszka Holland. She is the faintly daffy Aunt Lavinia, who derives a weirdly vicarious excitement from her niece\u2019s gentleman caller, and who \u2013 as we might say now \u2013 lives for the drama.</p> \n<h2>9. <strong>The VIPs (1963)</strong></h2> \n<p>A little gem of a turn from Smith (paired Rod Taylor) in this ensemble movie, scripted by Terence Rattigan, directed by Anthony Asquith and set in the VIP lounge of an airport. She is the mousy-yet-devoted Miss Mead, secretly in love with her employer, troubled businessman Les Mangrum, and willing to take risks to help him out of a jam.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e9067f6075b7ba1fd8107b2a7cc5b2701c5a6c7d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9067f6075b7ba1fd8107b2a7cc5b2701c5a6c7d/0_0_1937_2554/758.jpg\" alt=\"Smith puts a witty spin on her school marmish character in Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.\" width=\"758\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smith puts a witty spin on her schoolmarmish character in Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>8. <strong>Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone (2001)</strong></h2> \n<p>Smith gave a witty and good-natured spin on her schoolmarmish persona with this commanding performance as the teacher Minerva McGonagall in the Harry Potter franchise \u2013 and it was in the first film that she was most conspicuous. She is Hogwarts\u2019 deputy headmistress (later to be promoted), Gryffindor house head, transfiguration professor, quidditch enthusiast and member of the Order of the Phoenix, who is to play a decisive role in Harry\u2019s final battle with the forces of darkness. Potter is what lasered Smith into the minds of children all over the world.</p> \n<h2>7. <strong>The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (1987)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>This adaptation of the Brian Moore novel is a delicately detailed, beautifully acted drama in which Smith delivers a star performance. She is the tragic spinster in 1950s Dublin who imagines that the attentions being paid to her by Bob Hoskins\u2019s brash businessman mean that she is on the verge of a great romance. Perhaps it doesn\u2019t have the lightness and waspish asperity that we prize in a Smith performance, but this is fine work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e36d49c15a75f2b0bd21dddbfe568cdbc9b77db\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e36d49c15a75f2b0bd21dddbfe568cdbc9b77db/0_0_2745_1824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In charismatic form as the wife of a chiropodist (Michael Palin) in A Private Function.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In charismatic form as the wife of a chiropodist (Michael Palin) in A Private Function.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Handmade Films</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>6. <strong>A Private Function (1984)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>There is a certain type of online debate among Smith fans as to which is the latest film in which she is conventionally fanciable. This topic \u2013 vulgar and irrelevant as it is \u2013 has found a consensus with A Private Function, written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/18/alan-bennett-i-dont-fret-about-posterity-interview\" title=\"\">Alan Bennett</a> with Smith on fiercely charismatic form as Joyce, the demanding wife of shy, retiring chiropodist Gilbert, played by Palin. In the postwar era of rationing, they abduct a pig being secretly kept by grand townsfolk for a special civic feast to celebrate the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip. \u201cMrs Rhoades\u2019s ingrowing toenail has turned the corner,\u201d says Gilbert over supper. \u201cPlease Gilbert,\u201d says Smith acidly, \u201cplease don\u2019t bring feet to the table.\u201d</p> \n<h2>5. <strong>Nothing Like a Dame (2018)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Smith gave one of her greatest late-period performances as herself in this glorious documentary: a kind of alpha-league \u201cdame-off\u201d with Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and Eileen Atkins. These great stars sit round a table and discuss life, love, the stage, the screen, the way the profession has developed for women over the years \u2013 and the appalling men they have had to deal with. Smith almost upstages everyone with the revelation that her delivery is modelled on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/21/kenneth-williams-pen-pal\" title=\"\">Kenneth Williams</a>.</p> \n<h2>4. <strong>California Suite (1978)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>One of Smith\u2019s funniest, most self-aware performances \u2013 which won her a best supporting actress Oscar \u2013 came in this portmanteau all-star movie, adapted by Neil Simon from his Broadway stage play. She is Diana, a British actress returning from a catastrophic awards ceremony, desolate about her career and her \u201clavender\u201d marriage to Sidney, a closeted gay man played by Michael Caine: \u201cI\u2019ve aged Sidney. I\u2019m getting lines in my face. I look like a brand-new steel-belted radial tyre.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f6d99a76580e630a817e82998e2b7b846b945009\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6d99a76580e630a817e82998e2b7b846b945009/0_0_2572_1886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Formidable \u2026 Smith as Constance Trentham in Gosford Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"733\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Formidable \u2026 Smith as Constance Trentham in Gosford Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Capitol Films</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>3. <strong>Gosford Park (2001)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>This was the film that inspired the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/20/downton-abbey-movie-trailer-what-we-learned\" title=\"\">Downton Abbey</a> TV spinoff and gave Smith the prototype for the smallscreen role that helped make her famous all over the world. In this country-house mystery, written by Julian Fellowes and directed by Robert Altman, she is the formidable Countess of Trentham, a visitor to the great house. (In Downton, she has more or less the same persona, but promoted to quasi-chatelaine status as the Dowager Countess of Grantham.) Smith\u2019s character delivers weapons-grade putdowns and overwhelming patrician zingers.</p> \n<h2>2. <strong>The Lady in the Van (2015)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>A colossal performance from Smith as Miss Shepherd, the elderly homeless lady who chivvied Alan Bennett into letting her live in a van parked outside his house in London. She deploys the classic piercing stare of disapproval, the pinched lips and bird-like head movements as Miss Shepherd assesses the deeply unsatisfactory nature of everything around her.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5886dba1cf1957f6b3a75c977b9260cf90259356\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5886dba1cf1957f6b3a75c977b9260cf90259356/131_0_2438_1463/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Haughty and imperious in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Haughty and imperious in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>1. <strong>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969)</strong></h2> \n<p>This one really is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of Smith films. Give this film to a cinemagoer at an impressionable age, or any age, and he or she is Dame Maggie\u2019s for life. It is her classic role, which she immortalised at the age of 35 and which won her the best actress Oscar: imperious, haughty, vulnerable, unworldly, romantic, intellectual and with a distinctive hold over men. The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (the scansion of the title usually means the \u201cPrime\u201d and \u201cMiss\u201d are over emphasised; really, the last three words should be hit equally hard) is adapted by Jay Presson Allen from her own stage-play version of the Muriel Spark novel. It is the story of a charismatic Edinburgh schoolmistress (\u201cschoolteacher\u201d really won\u2019t do here) with unorthodox \u2013 and indeed worrying \u2013 views and a dominating personality. Successive generations have felt as if they were Brodie\u2019s pupils, falling under her spell.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "20. Sister Act (1992) Maggie Smith plays the authoritarian Mother Superior in this nuntastic box-office smash with a hint of Some Like It Hot, featuring Whoopi Goldberg as the lounge singer forced to go into a witness protection and join a convent after witnessing a mob slaying. There is some poignancy and dramatic edge to Smith\u2019s disapproving mien. 19. The Last September (1999) Before Downton and Gosford Park, there was this \u201ccountry house\u201d role for Maggie Smith, with John Banville\u2019s adaptation of Elizabeth Bowen\u2019s novel set in 1920s Ireland as the Anglo-Irish ascendancy becomes the descendancy. With subtle melancholy and restraint, Smith plays Lady Naylor, presiding over an estate in County Cork that feels increasingly embattled as Ireland prepares to break free of the British. 18. A Room With a View (1985) Smith plays Charlotte Bartlett in Ruth Prawer Jhabvala\u2019s adaptation of EM Forster\u2019s novel, directed by James Ivory. It is a small, but rather potent part as the wary and disapproving chaperone to her yearning younger cousin Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter), as they tour primly around Italy, fetching up in Florence. Charlotte is annoyed that their rooms do not have a \u201cview\u201d of the Arno, and her character epitomises the ironic inability to see the passionate possibilities laid out before her. 17. Young Cassidy (1965) Based on the life of the great dramatist Sean O\u2019Casey, this movie has the Australian star Rod Taylor as the man himself and Smith as the demure librarian who falls for him, inspires his creative and theatrical career and then selflessly lets him fly free of her. A conventional romantic turn. 16. Ladies in Lavender (2004) Very often, Smith finds herself in Werther\u2019s Original movies in which she is condescendingly required to be a feisty oldster. This period drama is a cut above. Judi Dench and Smith play two sisters living on the Cornish coast in the 1930s who take in a mysterious Polish stranger. His handsome brooding looks unlock dormant emotions in them both. A strong, yet nuanced performance from Smith. 15. Quartet (1981) A complex, unrelatable role for Smith in Jhabvala\u2019s cool, measured adaptation of the Jean Rhys novel, directed by Ivory. She plays Lois, a painter in 1920s Paris, married to a handsome art dealer (Alan Bates), a philanderer who invites a beautiful penniless young woman (Isabelle Adjani) to stay with them \u2013 for the purposes of seducing her. Lois has to become resentfully complicit in this dysfunctional non-love triangle. 14. The Missionary (1982) An eccentric comedy from George Harrison\u2019s Handmade Films is the first of two pairings for Smith and the film\u2019s screenwriter-star Michael Palin. He is the unworldly clergyman tasked with setting up a mission for \u201cfallen women\u201d in Edwardian London\u2019s East End. Smith is the sexually voracious Lady Isabel Ames, to whose wealthy husband the vicar must apply for charitable funding. Lady Isabel effectively promises to open her husband\u2019s chequebook in return for a night of passion with the handsome vicar. 13. Richard III (1995) A rare but special Shakespeare on screen for Smith, who plays the hated hunchback king\u2019s mother, the Duchess of York, opposite Ian McKellen\u2019s Richard in Richard Loncraine\u2019s Mosleyite-fascist staging. In some ways, it is another grande dame outing, but Smith brings to it a fierce energy and alienated anger \u2013 with a style perhaps borrowed from Queen Mary of Teck. 12. Travels With My Aunt (1972) This was the film, adapted from Graham Greene and directed by George Cukor, in which Smith first established her Wilde-Wodehousian \u201caunt\u201d persona: at just 38 years old, she is playing a formidable old lady of around twice that age. It is a wacky adventure mystery in which Alec McCowen plays a bewildered chap who finds himself finagled by his mysterious Aunt Augusta (Smith) into her plan to rescue her former lover from a kidnap plot. A broad comic performance. 11. Othello (1965) Smith held her own against one of the biggest alpha-gorillas of stage or screen, Laurence Olivier. In that distant age, he played Shakespeare\u2019s Othello in blackface and with a rolling, booming bass voice, while Smith played his wronged love, Desdemona, with mellifluous dignity and grace. 10. Washington Square (1997) Smith gives one of her blue-chip \u201caunt\u201d performances in this excellent, underrated and under-remembered Henry James adaptation, directed by Agnieszka Holland. She is the faintly daffy Aunt Lavinia, who derives a weirdly vicarious excitement from her niece\u2019s gentleman caller, and who \u2013 as we might say now \u2013 lives for the drama. 9. The VIPs (1963) A little gem of a turn from Smith (paired Rod Taylor) in this ensemble movie, scripted by Terence Rattigan, directed by Anthony Asquith and set in the VIP lounge of an airport. She is the mousy-yet-devoted Miss Mead, secretly in love with her employer, troubled businessman Les Mangrum, and willing to take risks to help him out of a jam. 8. Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone (2001) Smith gave a witty and good-natured spin on her schoolmarmish persona with this commanding performance as the teacher Minerva McGonagall in the Harry Potter franchise \u2013 and it was in the first film that she was most conspicuous. She is Hogwarts\u2019 deputy headmistress (later to be promoted), Gryffindor house head, transfiguration professor, quidditch enthusiast and member of the Order of the Phoenix, who is to play a decisive role in Harry\u2019s final battle with the forces of darkness. Potter is what lasered Smith into the minds of children all over the world. 7. The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (1987) This adaptation of the Brian Moore novel is a delicately detailed, beautifully acted drama in which Smith delivers a star performance. She is the tragic spinster in 1950s Dublin who imagines that the attentions being paid to her by Bob Hoskins\u2019s brash businessman mean that she is on the verge of a great romance. Perhaps it doesn\u2019t have the lightness and waspish asperity that we prize in a Smith performance, but this is fine work. 6. A Private Function (1984) There is a certain type of online debate among Smith fans as to which is the latest film in which she is conventionally fanciable. This topic \u2013 vulgar and irrelevant as it is \u2013 has found a consensus with A Private Function, written by Alan Bennett with Smith on fiercely charismatic form as Joyce, the demanding wife of shy, retiring chiropodist Gilbert, played by Palin. In the postwar era of rationing, they abduct a pig being secretly kept by grand townsfolk for a special civic feast to celebrate the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip. \u201cMrs Rhoades\u2019s ingrowing toenail has turned the corner,\u201d says Gilbert over supper. \u201cPlease Gilbert,\u201d says Smith acidly, \u201cplease don\u2019t bring feet to the table.\u201d 5. Nothing Like a Dame (2018) Smith gave one of her greatest late-period performances as herself in this glorious documentary: a kind of alpha-league \u201cdame-off\u201d with Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and Eileen Atkins. These great stars sit round a table and discuss life, love, the stage, the screen, the way the profession has developed for women over the years \u2013 and the appalling men they have had to deal with. Smith almost upstages everyone with the revelation that her delivery is modelled on Kenneth Williams. 4. California Suite (1978) One of Smith\u2019s funniest, most self-aware performances \u2013 which won her a best supporting actress Oscar \u2013 came in this portmanteau all-star movie, adapted by Neil Simon from his Broadway stage play. She is Diana, a British actress returning from a catastrophic awards ceremony, desolate about her career and her \u201clavender\u201d marriage to Sidney, a closeted gay man played by Michael Caine: \u201cI\u2019ve aged Sidney. I\u2019m getting lines in my face. I look like a brand-new steel-belted radial tyre.\u201d 3. Gosford Park (2001) This was the film that inspired the Downton Abbey TV spinoff and gave Smith the prototype for the smallscreen role that helped make her famous all over the world. In this country-house mystery, written by Julian Fellowes and directed by Robert Altman, she is the formidable Countess of Trentham, a visitor to the great house. (In Downton, she has more or less the same persona, but promoted to quasi-chatelaine status as the Dowager Countess of Grantham.) Smith\u2019s character delivers weapons-grade putdowns and overwhelming patrician zingers. 2. The Lady in the Van (2015) A colossal performance from Smith as Miss Shepherd, the elderly homeless lady who chivvied Alan Bennett into letting her live in a van parked outside his house in London. She deploys the classic piercing stare of disapproval, the pinched lips and bird-like head movements as Miss Shepherd assesses the deeply unsatisfactory nature of everything around her. 1. The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969) This one really is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of Smith films. Give this film to a cinemagoer at an impressionable age, or any age, and he or she is Dame Maggie\u2019s for life. It is her classic role, which she immortalised at the age of 35 and which won her the best actress Oscar: imperious, haughty, vulnerable, unworldly, romantic, intellectual and with a distinctive hold over men. The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (the scansion of the title usually means the \u201cPrime\u201d and \u201cMiss\u201d are over emphasised; really, the last three words should be hit equally hard) is adapted by Jay Presson Allen from her own stage-play version of the Muriel Spark novel. It is the story of a charismatic Edinburgh schoolmistress (\u201cschoolteacher\u201d really won\u2019t do here) with unorthodox \u2013 and indeed worrying \u2013 views and a dominating personality. Successive generations have felt as if they were Brodie\u2019s pupils, falling under her spell.",

The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.<br></p>\n    <p>At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran\u2019s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/sanctions-against-iran-to-be-lifted-after-compliance-with-nuclear-deal\">lifted in January 2016</a>, reconnecting Iran to global markets.</p>\n    <p>The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\">Iran</a>&nbsp;were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council\u2019s five permanent members \u2013 China, France, Russia, the UK and the US \u2013 and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.</p>\n    <p>On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/saeedkamalidehghan\">Saeed Kamali Dehghan</a>,</b>&nbsp;<i>Iran correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is suspicion that Netanyahu\u2019s lightning visit to London is in part designed to bolster his international standing and play the security card before highly charged elections in a fortnight.</p> \n<p>The timing also gives him a platform to pour cold water on a proposal from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that has already been greeted with deep scepticism by the US special representative on Iran, Brian Hook.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has reiterated his willingness to meet Rouhani, but said there would be no easing of US sanctions. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThat won\u2019t be happening.\u201d</p> \n<p>It would be a diplomatic coup for Israel and the US if they could lever Britain away from the Macron plan, and even more so away from the nuclear deal. London has so far resisted a year of pressure from the White House, and has stood alongside France and Germany, the two original signatories to the 2015 deal. The three countries insist that Iran had not breached the deal, and that it remained the best way to prevent nuclear proliferation in the region.</p> \n<p>Many European diplomats say the narrowing door to diplomacy remains open because Iran has announced it will take its next step on centrifuges only if, in two month\u2019s time, no progress on selling oil has been made. Iran also did not announce any steps to increase its level of uranium enrichment.</p> \n<p>France proposes a $15bn credit line as a prepayment for the purchase of Iranian oil, but the plan requires US willingness to reinstate sanctions waivers on countries that purchase Iranian oil. The credit line would be the first step in a phased programme to address wider concerns with Iran, including its ballistic missiles and regional behaviour. Britain has not yet said anything publicly in support of the plan, emphasising instead that it has been led by the French.</p> \n<p>Given the US and Israeli approach, however, Macron\u2019s chances of success seem to be receding. Rouhani has also refused to countenance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/26/too-soon-for-iran-talks-says-donald-trump-hassan-rouhani\">a meeting with Trump</a>, and the Iranian decision on centrifuges has disappointed the French.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu did not rule out such a meeting. \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t tell the US president when to meet or with whom,\u201d Netanyahu said. Responding to the suggestion that his brief visit was designed to boost his electoral appeal, Netanyahu said: \u201cThose delusional claims are a lie. I don\u2019t profiteer with our security.\u201d </p> \n<p>In a step away from confrontation, the owner of the captured British-flagged ship Stena Impero has confirmed that the Iranian authorities have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/iran-gives-europe-two-months-to-save-nuclear-deal\">released seven crew members</a>.</p> \n<p>In a separate development, US officials said on Thursday that Jason Greenblatt, Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East, planned to resign once the long-delayed US peace plan for Israel and Palestine is released.</p>",

In its first response to the Iranian decision, the Foreign Office said: \u201cIran\u2019s plan \u2026 is deeply concerning. This third step away from its commitments under the nuclear deal is particularly disappointing at a time when we and our European and international partners are working hard to de-escalate tensions with Iran.\u201d Netanyahu said: \u201cThis is not the time to hold talks with Iran. This is the time to increase the pressure on Iran. These are important matters for the state of Israel at all times, but especially now.\u201d There is suspicion that Netanyahu\u2019s lightning visit to London is in part designed to bolster his international standing and play the security card before highly charged elections in a fortnight. The timing also gives him a platform to pour cold water on a proposal from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that has already been greeted with deep scepticism by the US special representative on Iran, Brian Hook. Donald Trump has reiterated his willingness to meet Rouhani, but said there would be no easing of US sanctions. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThat won\u2019t be happening.\u201d It would be a diplomatic coup for Israel and the US if they could lever Britain away from the Macron plan, and even more so away from the nuclear deal. London has so far resisted a year of pressure from the White House, and has stood alongside France and Germany, the two original signatories to the 2015 deal. The three countries insist that Iran had not breached the deal, and that it remained the best way to prevent nuclear proliferation in the region. Many European diplomats say the narrowing door to diplomacy remains open because Iran has announced it will take its next step on centrifuges only if, in two month\u2019s time, no progress on selling oil has been made. Iran also did not announce any steps to increase its level of uranium enrichment. France proposes a $15bn credit line as a prepayment for the purchase of Iranian oil, but the plan requires US willingness to reinstate sanctions waivers on countries that purchase Iranian oil. The credit line would be the first step in a phased programme to address wider concerns with Iran, including its ballistic missiles and regional behaviour. Britain has not yet said anything publicly in support of the plan, emphasising instead that it has been led by the French. Given the US and Israeli approach, however, Macron\u2019s chances of success seem to be receding. Rouhani has also refused to countenance a meeting with Trump, and the Iranian decision on centrifuges has disappointed the French. Netanyahu did not rule out such a meeting. \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t tell the US president when to meet or with whom,\u201d Netanyahu said. Responding to the suggestion that his brief visit was designed to boost his electoral appeal, Netanyahu said: \u201cThose delusional claims are a lie. I don\u2019t profiteer with our security.\u201d In a step away from confrontation, the owner of the captured British-flagged ship Stena Impero has confirmed that the Iranian authorities have released seven crew members. In a separate development, US officials said on Thursday that Jason Greenblatt, Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East, planned to resign once the long-delayed US peace plan for Israel and Palestine is released.",

      "body": "<p>In 2007, in the middle of the re-formed Stooges\u2019 chaotic Glastonbury performance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/iggy-pop\">Iggy Pop</a> suddenly struck up with an a cappella rendition of 1965 movie theme The Shadow of Your Smile. This clearly wasn\u2019t something the audience were expecting: No Fun, yes; I Wanna Be Your Dog, of course; an easy listening ballad made famous by Johnny Mathis and subsequently covered by Engelbert Humperdinck, not so much. But it wasn\u2019t an isolated incident: throughout the Stooges\u2019 career, Pop showed a propensity for launching into The Shadow of Your Smile at unlikely moments. He sang it in 1972, for CBS Records boss Clive Davis, in the hope of convincing him to sign the Stooges at a point in their career when the band had been written off as a joke: a move that paid off. Later that year, he sang it during the Stooges\u2019 mythic performance at London\u2019s Scala cinema, to an audience who were largely bemused or horrified by what was happening on stage. There are muddy bootleg recordings of him singing it at whatever godforsaken venues the Stooges were reduced to playing in 1974, during the original band\u2019s harrowing terminal phase. Pop, it seems, has always been keen to demonstrate that, amid the chaos and bloodshed and visceral rock\u2019n\u2019roll on which his reputation is based, he\u2019s a man of many, perhaps improbable, parts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a62713fd7c9613c91fcb3efe1acca4ba9405a10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a62713fd7c9613c91fcb3efe1acca4ba9405a10/0_0_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iggy Pop: Free album art work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iggy Pop: Free album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is worth remembering when trying to make sense of his recent solo releases.

His contribution to the title track consists of him saying \u201cI wanna be free\u201d, twice.

      "body": "<h2>Arsenal</h2> \n<p>The champions are back on their perch after a dominating run of nine consecutive league titles was ended by Liverpool in 2013. Arsenal had lost their way under Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa before the arrival of Joe Montemurro. Now, the team seem to have rediscovered their identity and they play with a purpose and swagger that is joyful to watch. A devastatingly long injury list threatened to derail last season\u2019s campaign but those players are returning now and, as Arsenal have recruited well, they have to be favourites to retain their title.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/fa-womens-football-wsl-streaming\">FA to launch streaming platform dedicated to women\u2019s football</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Coach </strong>Joe Montemurro. The Australian was recruited from Melbourne City towards the end of 2017 and has transformed the side. The key to his success is a laid back attitude, a vision for the way the team he supported growing up should play and the unerring trust of his players.</p> \n<p><strong>Major ins and outs </strong>The Euro 2017 winners Dominique Bloodworth and the goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal have both been moved on and given the latter\u2019s World Cup heroics there may be some regret. In, though, comes their compatriot Jill Roord, who has been flying in pre-season, and her Bayern Munich teammates Manuela Zinsberger and Leonie Maier. Jen Beattie returns to the club from their title rivals Manchester City, with Janni Arnth switching to Fiorentina as a result.</p> \n<p><strong>Star player</strong> Vivianne Miedema. Arsenal have a number of world class players in their ranks but it is hard to look past last season\u2019s top scorer, with 22 league goals. She has also become the Netherlands\u2019 all-time top scorer with 63 goals while only 23 years old.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"090297398f00375f48ed41f0ee81a42f2f773f4e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/090297398f00375f48ed41f0ee81a42f2f773f4e/0_0_5265_3549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arsenal\u2019s Jill Roord during the pre-season friendly against Barcelona Femini at Meadow Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arsenal\u2019s Jill Roord during the pre-season friendly against Barcelona Femini at Meadow Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Birmingham</h2> \n<p>Following the departure of the much-liked Marc Skinner to Orlando Pride with a handful of games remaining, a fourth-place finish and the arrival of the new manager, Marta Tejedor, has not helped the club keep hold of their key players. Many of the club stalwarts had likely remained in the West Midlands out of loyalty to Skinner. The team has been overhauled and, following a batch of behind-closed-doors friendlies, there is little to indicate what we can expect when they step out against Everton on Sunday.</p> \n<p><strong>Coach</strong> Marta Tejedor. When Tejedor was announced as Skinner\u2019s replacement no one knew quite what to expect. The former Chile and Peru manager, who also managed CD Tac\u00f3n between 2016-18 (the team being taken over by Real Madrid), was an unknown. She hit the ground running with a thrilling 3-2 away win at Chelsea but then back-to-back losses meant she ended the season with five wins from seven in charge.</p> \n<p><strong>Major ins and outs</strong> The 10 departing players include some key first-team players. England\u2019s hero in France, Ellen White, and newly called-up Aoife Mannion have both switched to Manchester City while Hayley Ladd has joined United. Brianna Visalli has arrived from West Ham, while three have been recruited from the US college system.</p> \n<p><strong>Star player</strong> Lucy Staniforth. The England midfielder is one player Birmingham have been able to cling on to, despite rumours she wanted out. With a contract in place and no club wanting to stump up cash to get her out of it, Staniforth stays and will be key to their season.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e93e09bb1f5710c65edd4a4d3fc718615bcd12a1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e93e09bb1f5710c65edd4a4d3fc718615bcd12a1/0_0_4829_3076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Birmingham City\u2019s Lucy Staniforth trains with England in Bergen before the friendly international against Norway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Birmingham City\u2019s Lucy Staniforth trains with England in Bergen before the friendly against Norway.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Cameron for The FA/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Brighton</h2> \n<p>The Seagulls struggled in their maiden WSL season, recording four wins and four draws, and finished only four points above Everton but more comfortably above relegated Yeovil. With Manchester United and Tottenham coming up, the league will be much tighter and Brighton will be in danger of being squeezed out. With Hope Powell at the helm though they have a manager with bags of experience. Changes have been minimal with Powell trusting the majority of the existing squad to lead them into the new season.</p> \n<p><strong>Coach </strong>Hope Powell. The 52-year-old has a first domestic season of management under her belt and there can be little doubt that she will have soaked up plenty about what is needed to survive in the top flight. A self-proclaimed \u201cbuilder\u201d, she is entering season two of her project but only time will tell on whether improvements in her team will be enough to counteract a more competitive league.</p> \n<p><strong>Major ins and outs </strong>Brighton have kept hold of the majority of their squad including key players such as Ellie Brazil and Ini-Abasi Umotong. Powell has added Yeovil\u2019s superb goalkeeper Megan Walsh and the experienced former Paris Saint-Germain player L\u00e9a Le Garrec from Guingamp as well as Danique Kerkdijk from Bristol City.</p> \n<p><strong>Star player</strong> Ellie Brazil. She has represented England at every youth level and joined Brighton after a year with Fiorentina, having moved to Italy as one of England\u2019s brightest young prospects. She finished as the team\u2019s top scorer last season with four league goals \u2013 not a figure that will set the world on fire but a solid contribution in a tough first professional season for the team.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36eca2bd19e6b0173c2bfad9e1c756d004441980\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36eca2bd19e6b0173c2bfad9e1c756d004441980/0_0_4449_3185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brighton\u2019s Ellie Brazil is challenged by Danielle Van de Donk of Arsenal during last season\u2019s league match in Brighton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brighton\u2019s Ellie Brazil is challenged by Danielle Van de Donk of Arsenal during last season\u2019s league match in Brighton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dael/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Bristol City</h2> \n<p>A mid table finish felt fitting of their hit and miss campaign last season. From December they went on a five-game unbeaten run in the league but then picked up three points in their next six games. Two draws against title-chasing Manchester City and a 0-0 with Chelsea showed that Tanya Oxtoby\u2019s side can trouble the best teams, despite a significantly smaller budget, and they finished two places and nine points higher than they did the preceding season under Willie Kirk. Consistency will be key and Bristol City are one of the three women\u2019s teams still flying the flag in a division higher than their male counterparts.</p> \n<p><strong>Coach</strong> Tanya Oxtoby. The Australian, who has a psychology degree, led Bristol City to their best ever points total in her first season in charge. That a poor finish left them frustrated is a testament to how Oxtoby quietly steadied the ship after Willie Kirk left for Manchester United last summer.</p> \n<p><strong>Major ins and outs </strong>Pouncing on the chaos at Birmingham, Oxtoby has recruited the defender Meaghan Sargeant and the forward Charlie Wellings from the WSL club. Ebony Salmon, who performed well on loan with Sheffield United from Manchester United, has also come in. Their biggest loss is the Scottish midfielder Lucy Graham, who has joined up with former manager Willie Kirk at Everton.</p> \n<p><strong>Star player </strong>Sophie Baggaley. The 22-year-old goalkeeper had a superb 2018-19 and many thought the uncapped player deserved a World Cup spot. Named in the PFA team of the year and the FA\u2019s Players\u2019 Player of the Year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"18bf3b21c17a816694d7d7f7f59def6475aafa23\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18bf3b21c17a816694d7d7f7f59def6475aafa23/0_0_3521_2347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bristol City goalkeeper Sophie Baggaley takes control of the ball against Birmingham City last season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bristol City goalkeeper Sophie Baggaley takes control of the ball against Birmingham last season.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PetaPix/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Chelsea</h2> \n<p>It would be fair to describe Chelsea\u2019s 2018-19 as an anomaly season. Emma Hayes has said grappling with the grief of losing a child and becoming a first-time mum to son Harry affected Chelsea\u2019s pre-season last summer and played a role in their rocky start. That was added to by the departure of a host of experienced players, such as Claire Rafferty and Katie Chapman, and the need for a rebuild. That their domestic campaign was over by Christmas was countered by a strong Champions League run that saw Chelsea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/28/chelsea-lyon-womens-champions-league-match-report\">narrowly defeated by Lyon in the semi-finals</a>. Despite an underwhelming pre-season it is unlikely that they will be as slow off the mark as they were last term. Not having Champions League football will be a frustration, but will also ensure they can focus on domestic success.</p> \n<p><strong>Coach</strong> Emma Hayes. It is no accident that when Maurizio Sarri left Chelsea, Hayes was a name touted as a replacement for the Italian. That is how highly respected she is. In her seventh year at Chelsea, with two league titles and two FA Cups, the Champions League is the golden egg. Expect them to go hard for qualification for next year\u2019s competition.</p> \n<p><strong>Major ins and outs</strong> The exciting Norwegian Guro Reiten is Hayes\u2019s only summer recruit. She has 51 goals in 53 appearances for the Norwegian champions LSK Kvinner. As expected, the out-of-favour Hedvig Lindahl has exited, moving to Wolfsburg after a stunning World Cup.</p> \n<p><strong>Star player </strong>Ji So-yun. The magical midfielder makes the Chelsea attack tick. Few have her vision and, alongside Beth England, she was one of the few players (ahead of the sturdy defence) to shine while the Blues struggled.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6def04c1aac2587887d2d14b38cff2999b0acb88\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6def04c1aac2587887d2d14b38cff2999b0acb88/0_51_4306_2802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea\u2019s Guro Reiten is challenged by Nerilia Mondesir of Montpellier Herault Sport Club Feminines  at Stade Michel Bendichou on 6 August 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea\u2019s Guro Reiten is challenged by Nerilia Mondesir of Montpellier during a pre-season friendly.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><br></p> \n<h2>Everton</h2> \n<p>With Yeovil deducted 10 points for entering administration, Everton\u2019s future in the top division was ensured in March. The recruitment of Willie Kirk in December following the sacking of Andy Spence saw the team record their first win in February, satisfyingly against Liverpool. Their struggles continued though and the team picked up only two further wins. Kirk, however, had yet to have a window to recruit in and his own set of players to shape. With their facilities at Finch Farm getting a revamp, a new home ground on the horizon and Kirk\u2019s first batch of players to come in Everton will hope for a more competitive campaign.</p> \n<p><strong>Coach</strong> Willie Kirk. It was a shock when he swapped Manchester for Everton after only six months as Casey Stoney\u2019s No 2 at United. Kirk has a reputation for bringing through young players, which chimed with Everton when they were looking for a fresh face. This will be his first full season at the club and therefore the first real test of his time on Merseyside.</p> \n<p><strong>Major ins and outs</strong> With five in and five out, there have not been major changes at Everton. Kika van Es from Ajax is exciting, as is Kirk reuniting with Lucy Graham.</p> \n<p><strong>Star player </strong>Gabby George. The highly regarded defender is, at 22, the base of Everton\u2019s spine. She has not been able to move beyond her two senior England caps but, in a struggling team, she has been consistent at the back.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"586f75991c2a73c799bd0c8026e5028224a21038\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/586f75991c2a73c799bd0c8026e5028224a21038/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simone Magill, Gabby George and Dan Turner during Everton\u2019s pre-season trip to Nairobi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simone Magill, Gabby George and Dan Turner during Everton\u2019s pre-season trip to Nairobi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony McArdle/Everton FC/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Liverpool</h2> \n<p>Vicky Jepson was handed a big task when she was appointed manager of Liverpool in October after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/14/liverpool-women-chris-kirkland-neil-redfearn-resignation\">Neil Redfearn\u2019s resignation</a> just one game into the WSL season, which pointed to discontent at the relationship between the women\u2019s team and the club. It was a low for the team who were back-to-back WSL champions in 2013 and 2014. Now though, signs of the team being taken seriously are evident, the joint pre-season tour with the men\u2019s team one hint. They finished eighth last term, two places down on the preceding season, but that is set against the backdrop of the chaotic start. Now the manager has had her first pre-season in charge and her first summer transfer window.</p> \n<p><strong>Coach</strong> Vicky Jepson. Jepson was taken on as caretaker with Chris Kirkland as her assistant following Redfearn\u2019s shock exit. She has worked at Liverpool for 10 years, with coaching the development squad among her roles. With Kirkland now having moved on, Jepson has been trusted with the challenge of making Liverpool competitive again.</p> \n<p><strong>Major ins and outs</strong> There have not been big changes. Seven have been shipped out but only three recruited. They include Manchester City\u2019s Mel Lawley and Chelsea\u2019s Jade Bailey. Both have a point to prove having fallen out of favour at their respective clubs.</p> \n<p><strong>Star player </strong>Courtney Sweetman-Kirk. Nabbed from city rivals Everton, Sweetman-Kirk scored 10 goals to finish the seventh highest goalscorer in the WSL last season.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66b782f4bc90b28527730de2c14f0e29aa2796b1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66b782f4bc90b28527730de2c14f0e29aa2796b1/0_525_3765_2654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Courtney Sweetman-Kirk during the pre-season match against the Metropolitan All Stars at Jordan Field in Boston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Courtney Sweetman-Kirk during the pre-season match against the Metropolitan All Stars at Jordan Field in Boston.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Omar Rawlings/Liverpool FC/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Manchester City</h2> \n<p>Won a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/04/manchester-city-women-west-ham-women-fa-cup-final-match-report\">domestic cup double</a> but still finished last season with a tinge of disappointment. The team\u2019s unbeaten run was ended on the final day of the season, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/may/11/arsenal-v-manchester-city-womens-super-league-final-day-live\">against champions Arsenal</a>, with their five draws costing them dearly. Meanwhile, their Champions League campaign fell at the first hurdle, in a round of 32 defeat to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. These are the two competitions that will dominate their focus this time round. Solid defensively, they struggled to spread the goal load beyond Nikita Parris and Georgia Stanway. The recruitment of the out-and-out No 9 Ellen White should give them a potent figurehead to alleviate the loss of the departing Parris. However, surgery on an injury, which rules her out for the foreseeable, could prove costly and others will need to step up.</p> \n<p><strong>Coach</strong> Nick Cushing. After a trophyless 2017-18, Cushing led City to FA Cup and Continental League Cup titles and his side were one game from an unbeaten season. The football City play isn\u2019t always pretty but it is effective and Cushing\u2019s talent for trusting young players in his title-contending side is admirable. With a much kinder last-32 draw, against Swiss side Lugano, there will be hopes of a strong Champions League campaign. Cushing needs his team to show greater signs of progress to silence doubters.</p> \n<p><strong>Major ins and outs</strong> Alongside White, the excellent centre-back Aoife Mannion joins from Birmingham \u2013 to replace the Arsenal-bound Jen Beattie. The South Korea captain, Lee Geum-min, also joins the forward line while Cushing continues to talent-spot youngsters with the 18-year-old Irish midfielder Tyler Toland also arriving.</p> \n<p><strong>Star player </strong>Kiera Walsh. Shielding the defence and conducting the attack, few have an eye for a pass like Walsh. After a disappointing World Cup, but a stand-out performance against the USA, the 22-year-old will be looking to pick up on the fine form she showed last season that made her a rumoured target of numerous European clubs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e66631fa-56c9-4821-a015-0272736f6178\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6j82ySAaU_0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Manchester United</h2> \n<p>The club\u2019s Championship-winning campaign served a purpose; to prepare the new side for the top tier. Now that preparation will be put to the test. The defence in particular, which cruised to 11 clean sheets, will come up against the might of the WSL\u2019s finest. When they met WSL level opposition in cup competitions last team, they credibly won three and lost two \u2013 to Arsenal in the Continental Cup and narrowly to Reading in the FA Cup. Stoney has added experience to balance the team, not being held back by loyalty to her \u201chistory-making\u201d youngsters. But whether they gel quickly enough, and how they cope with not being the dominant league force will be the Stoney\u2019s biggest test.</p> \n<p><strong>Coach</strong> Casey Stoney. Has her first season in management under her belt and the seriousness and professionalism of the former England international matched the attitude she was known for on the pitch. Now though, is the next phase of project United and a more comprehensive look at Stoney\u2019s ability to coach through the ups and downs of a competitive league.</p> \n<p><strong>Major ins and outs</strong> The recruitment of the Dutch midfielder Jackie Groenen is United\u2019s biggest coup. While the additions of Birmingham\u2019s Hayley Ladd, the experienced forward Jane Ross from West Ham, Lotta \u00d6kvist from Hammarby and Abbie McManus, who has crossed from the blue half of Manchester, show a serious effort has been made to add grit and experience.</p> \n<p><strong>Star player</strong> Jackie Groenen. The new recruit, a World Cup finalist with the Netherlands, is expected to be the figurehead of Stoney\u2019s side following the departure of captain Alex Greenwood.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b0d50cc1302b189534520c43d03ecf67d52dabb1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0d50cc1302b189534520c43d03ecf67d52dabb1/0_0_3000_2259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United line up for the pre-season friendly against Valerenga in Oslo with new signings Hayley Ladd and Jane Ross\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United line up for the pre-season friendly against Valerenga in Oslo with new signings Hayley Ladd and Jane Ross.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Reading</h2> \n<p>They finished last season in fifth, one down on the previous campaign but were a dispiriting 13 points off fourth place. There haven\u2019t been major changes to the squad for the new season with Wales\u2019s Angharad James the most notable recruit, joined by two Danish youngsters as well as Maxime Bennink from the Dutch side PEC Zwolle. As for all the mid-table teams, the arrival of Manchester United and Tottenham threaten to rock the boat.</p> \n<p><strong>Coach</strong> Kelly Chambers. The Reading manager took over from the former Arsenal midfielder Jayne Ludlow in 2014 when the latter became Wales manager. Since then Chambers has taken the team from part-time to full and, though they are not title contenders, built a side that can trouble the top.</p> \n<p><strong>Major ins and outs</strong> Angharad James has joined from Everton to bring the Welsh contingent to three while the experienced Gemma Davison has left for Tottenham.</p> \n<p><strong>Star player </strong>Reading may have the Wales captain, Natasha Harding, and England\u2019s Jade Moore in their ranks, but it is the elder Lionesses, Fara Williams, who still provides one of the biggest threats in the Reading attack. With 12 goals last year she finished the third highest goal scorer in the WSL.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b33680307c8670f9ec0d47a51ed39a119a00d8d4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b33680307c8670f9ec0d47a51ed39a119a00d8d4/0_44_2000_1619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reading\u2019s Fara Williams wins a header against West Ham during last season\u2019s FA Cup semi-final at Adams Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"810\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reading\u2019s Fara Williams wins a header against West Ham during last season\u2019s FA Cup semi-final at Adams Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Chance/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Tottenham</h2> \n<p>Spurs have overhauled the team before their first season in the top flight. Seven of their nine recruits are from WSL sides with the manager looking to add professional level experience to her ranks. With the team more firmly under the wing of the men\u2019s club, a showpiece north London Derby <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/10/wsls-north-london-derby-to-be-staged-at-tottenham-new-stadium\">at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium</a> in November illustrating as much, there is a feeling that Spurs are ready to push on a level. Last year wins against Brighton and Yeovil in the Continental Cup showed they can compete against WSL opposition, but a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City once they had escaped the group and a 5-0 thumping by Chelsea in the FA Cup showed they have a way to go before they disrupt things further up the food chain. With a trip to Stamford Bridge on the opening weekend, how much they\u2019ve been able to do to bridge the gap will be there for all to see.</p> \n<p><strong>Coach</strong> Karen Hills. In Hills and the first-team coach, Juan Amoros, Tottenham have a duo who have worked together at the club since 2011. Under Hills, who joined in 2007, the team have climbed from the London and South East Regional Premier division to the Women\u2019s Super League.</p> \n<p><strong>Major ins and outs</strong> The recruitment list is long and includes the goalkeeper Becky Spencer and the defender Ria Percival (both West Ham) as well as the Dutch defender Siri Worm (Everton), Gemma Davison (Reading) while the two forwards Lucy Quinn (Birmingham) and Kit Graham (Charlton) add to the attack.</p> \n<p><strong>Star player </strong>With the likes of Gemma Davison coming in it would be easy to name a new recruit as the star player. But in Ashleigh Neville, Tottenham have a player with pace and skill from left-back to influence games and who was a key part of their drive to promotion.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66529f6b8b100391f7689c4ae1231d682dfd113f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66529f6b8b100391f7689c4ae1231d682dfd113f/0_0_5000_3392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tottenham\u2019s Gemma Davison during the Ramon de Carranza trophy between Athletic Club Bilbao and Tottenham Hotspur in Cadiz, Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tottenham\u2019s Gemma Davison on the ball during the Ramon de Carranza trophy match against Athletic Bilbao in Cadiz.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><br>West Ham United</h2> \n<p>Their first season in the top flight ended with the team a respectable seventh and an unexpected FA Cup final. Despite a frustrating defeat to Manchester City, after a strong first-half performance, that Matt Beard\u2019s side reached the Wembley final at the first time of asking (as a top-tier outfit) is incredibly impressive. After putting the team together in eight weeks, he has now had his first chance to give them a big overhaul. West Ham are a team with major ambitions, they want to be competing at the top and climbing the table will be seen as a must.</p> \n<p><strong>Coach</strong> Matt Beard. Few have the WSL credentials of Beard. The two-time WSL winner unseated Arsenal with Liverpool in 2013 and 2014 before moving to the US. On his return, the fiery Cockney led West Ham to an FA Cup final in his maiden season.</p> \n<p><strong>Major ins and outs</strong> Seven in, eight out. Matt Beard has an uncanny ability to pluck gems from the unknown and this season will likely see the same with the likes of Martha Thomas and Courtney Brosnan from Le Havre brought in. Jacynta Galabadaarachchi joins from Perth Glory to test headline writers but Claire Rafferty\u2019s retirement and Jane Ross\u2019s switch to Manchester United means some experience has been lost.</p> \n<p><strong>Star player</strong> Alisha Lehmann. The Swiss forward was nominated for the PFA\u2019s Young Player of the Year award in her first season in English football and her nine goals were a big reason for that.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4725d2d7bb4d8ab0f82b4784d83a2fbb124c7385\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4725d2d7bb4d8ab0f82b4784d83a2fbb124c7385/0_0_2987_1991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Ham United\u2019s Alisha Lehmann takes on Demi Stokes of Manchester City during the FA Cup Final at Wembley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West Ham United\u2019s Alisha Lehmann takes on Demi Stokes of Manchester City during the FA Cup Final at Wembley.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Arsenal The champions are back on their perch after a dominating run of nine consecutive league titles was ended by Liverpool in 2013. Arsenal had lost their way under Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa before the arrival of Joe Montemurro. Now, the team seem to have rediscovered their identity and they play with a purpose and swagger that is joyful to watch. A devastatingly long injury list threatened to derail last season\u2019s campaign but those players are returning now and, as Arsenal have recruited well, they have to be favourites to retain their title. Coach Joe Montemurro. The Australian was recruited from Melbourne City towards the end of 2017 and has transformed the side. The key to his success is a laid back attitude, a vision for the way the team he supported growing up should play and the unerring trust of his players. Major ins and outs The Euro 2017 winners Dominique Bloodworth and the goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal have both been moved on and given the latter\u2019s World Cup heroics there may be some regret. In, though, comes their compatriot Jill Roord, who has been flying in pre-season, and her Bayern Munich teammates Manuela Zinsberger and Leonie Maier. Jen Beattie returns to the club from their title rivals Manchester City, with Janni Arnth switching to Fiorentina as a result. Star player Vivianne Miedema. Arsenal have a number of world class players in their ranks but it is hard to look past last season\u2019s top scorer, with 22 league goals. She has also become the Netherlands\u2019 all-time top scorer with 63 goals while only 23 years old. Birmingham Following the departure of the much-liked Marc Skinner to Orlando Pride with a handful of games remaining, a fourth-place finish and the arrival of the new manager, Marta Tejedor, has not helped the club keep hold of their key players. Many of the club stalwarts had likely remained in the West Midlands out of loyalty to Skinner. The team has been overhauled and, following a batch of behind-closed-doors friendlies, there is little to indicate what we can expect when they step out against Everton on Sunday. Coach Marta Tejedor. When Tejedor was announced as Skinner\u2019s replacement no one knew quite what to expect. The former Chile and Peru manager, who also managed CD Tac\u00f3n between 2016-18 (the team being taken over by Real Madrid), was an unknown. She hit the ground running with a thrilling 3-2 away win at Chelsea but then back-to-back losses meant she ended the season with five wins from seven in charge. Major ins and outs The 10 departing players include some key first-team players. England\u2019s hero in France, Ellen White, and newly called-up Aoife Mannion have both switched to Manchester City while Hayley Ladd has joined United. Brianna Visalli has arrived from West Ham, while three have been recruited from the US college system. Star player Lucy Staniforth. The England midfielder is one player Birmingham have been able to cling on to, despite rumours she wanted out. With a contract in place and no club wanting to stump up cash to get her out of it, Staniforth stays and will be key to their season. Brighton The Seagulls struggled in their maiden WSL season, recording four wins and four draws, and finished only four points above Everton but more comfortably above relegated Yeovil. With Manchester United and Tottenham coming up, the league will be much tighter and Brighton will be in danger of being squeezed out. With Hope Powell at the helm though they have a manager with bags of experience. Changes have been minimal with Powell trusting the majority of the existing squad to lead them into the new season. Coach Hope Powell. The 52-year-old has a first domestic season of management under her belt and there can be little doubt that she will have soaked up plenty about what is needed to survive in the top flight. A self-proclaimed \u201cbuilder\u201d, she is entering season two of her project but only time will tell on whether improvements in her team will be enough to counteract a more competitive league. Major ins and outs Brighton have kept hold of the majority of their squad including key players such as Ellie Brazil and Ini-Abasi Umotong. Powell has added Yeovil\u2019s superb goalkeeper Megan Walsh and the experienced former Paris Saint-Germain player L\u00e9a Le Garrec from Guingamp as well as Danique Kerkdijk from Bristol City. Star player Ellie Brazil. She has represented England at every youth level and joined Brighton after a year with Fiorentina, having moved to Italy as one of England\u2019s brightest young prospects. She finished as the team\u2019s top scorer last season with four league goals \u2013 not a figure that will set the world on fire but a solid contribution in a tough first professional season for the team. Bristol City A mid table finish felt fitting of their hit and miss campaign last season. From December they went on a five-game unbeaten run in the league but then picked up three points in their next six games. Two draws against title-chasing Manchester City and a 0-0 with Chelsea showed that Tanya Oxtoby\u2019s side can trouble the best teams, despite a significantly smaller budget, and they finished two places and nine points higher than they did the preceding season under Willie Kirk. Consistency will be key and Bristol City are one of the three women\u2019s teams still flying the flag in a division higher than their male counterparts. Coach Tanya Oxtoby. The Australian, who has a psychology degree, led Bristol City to their best ever points total in her first season in charge. That a poor finish left them frustrated is a testament to how Oxtoby quietly steadied the ship after Willie Kirk left for Manchester United last summer. Major ins and outs Pouncing on the chaos at Birmingham, Oxtoby has recruited the defender Meaghan Sargeant and the forward Charlie Wellings from the WSL club. Ebony Salmon, who performed well on loan with Sheffield United from Manchester United, has also come in. Their biggest loss is the Scottish midfielder Lucy Graham, who has joined up with former manager Willie Kirk at Everton. Star player Sophie Baggaley. The 22-year-old goalkeeper had a superb 2018-19 and many thought the uncapped player deserved a World Cup spot. Named in the PFA team of the year and the FA\u2019s Players\u2019 Player of the Year. Chelsea It would be fair to describe Chelsea\u2019s 2018-19 as an anomaly season. Emma Hayes has said grappling with the grief of losing a child and becoming a first-time mum to son Harry affected Chelsea\u2019s pre-season last summer and played a role in their rocky start. That was added to by the departure of a host of experienced players, such as Claire Rafferty and Katie Chapman, and the need for a rebuild. That their domestic campaign was over by Christmas was countered by a strong Champions League run that saw Chelsea narrowly defeated by Lyon in the semi-finals. Despite an underwhelming pre-season it is unlikely that they will be as slow off the mark as they were last term. Not having Champions League football will be a frustration, but will also ensure they can focus on domestic success. Coach Emma Hayes. It is no accident that when Maurizio Sarri left Chelsea, Hayes was a name touted as a replacement for the Italian. That is how highly respected she is. In her seventh year at Chelsea, with two league titles and two FA Cups, the Champions League is the golden egg. Expect them to go hard for qualification for next year\u2019s competition. Major ins and outs The exciting Norwegian Guro Reiten is Hayes\u2019s only summer recruit. She has 51 goals in 53 appearances for the Norwegian champions LSK Kvinner. As expected, the out-of-favour Hedvig Lindahl has exited, moving to Wolfsburg after a stunning World Cup. Star player Ji So-yun. The magical midfielder makes the Chelsea attack tick. Few have her vision and, alongside Beth England, she was one of the few players (ahead of the sturdy defence) to shine while the Blues struggled. Everton With Yeovil deducted 10 points for entering administration, Everton\u2019s future in the top division was ensured in March. The recruitment of Willie Kirk in December following the sacking of Andy Spence saw the team record their first win in February, satisfyingly against Liverpool. Their struggles continued though and the team picked up only two further wins. Kirk, however, had yet to have a window to recruit in and his own set of players to shape. With their facilities at Finch Farm getting a revamp, a new home ground on the horizon and Kirk\u2019s first batch of players to come in Everton will hope for a more competitive campaign. Coach Willie Kirk. It was a shock when he swapped Manchester for Everton after only six months as Casey Stoney\u2019s No 2 at United. Kirk has a reputation for bringing through young players, which chimed with Everton when they were looking for a fresh face. This will be his first full season at the club and therefore the first real test of his time on Merseyside. Major ins and outs With five in and five out, there have not been major changes at Everton. Kika van Es from Ajax is exciting, as is Kirk reuniting with Lucy Graham. Star player Gabby George. The highly regarded defender is, at 22, the base of Everton\u2019s spine. She has not been able to move beyond her two senior England caps but, in a struggling team, she has been consistent at the back. Liverpool Vicky Jepson was handed a big task when she was appointed manager of Liverpool in October after Neil Redfearn\u2019s resignation just one game into the WSL season, which pointed to discontent at the relationship between the women\u2019s team and the club. It was a low for the team who were back-to-back WSL champions in 2013 and 2014. Now though, signs of the team being taken seriously are evident, the joint pre-season tour with the men\u2019s team one hint. They finished eighth last term, two places down on the preceding season, but that is set against the backdrop of the chaotic start. Now the manager has had her first pre-season in charge and her first summer transfer window. Coach Vicky Jepson. Jepson was taken on as caretaker with Chris Kirkland as her assistant following Redfearn\u2019s shock exit. She has worked at Liverpool for 10 years, with coaching the development squad among her roles. With Kirkland now having moved on, Jepson has been trusted with the challenge of making Liverpool competitive again. Major ins and outs There have not been big changes. Seven have been shipped out but only three recruited. They include Manchester City\u2019s Mel Lawley and Chelsea\u2019s Jade Bailey. Both have a point to prove having fallen out of favour at their respective clubs. Star player Courtney Sweetman-Kirk. Nabbed from city rivals Everton, Sweetman-Kirk scored 10 goals to finish the seventh highest goalscorer in the WSL last season. Manchester City Won a domestic cup double but still finished last season with a tinge of disappointment. The team\u2019s unbeaten run was ended on the final day of the season, against champions Arsenal, with their five draws costing them dearly. Meanwhile, their Champions League campaign fell at the first hurdle, in a round of 32 defeat to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. These are the two competitions that will dominate their focus this time round. Solid defensively, they struggled to spread the goal load beyond Nikita Parris and Georgia Stanway. The recruitment of the out-and-out No 9 Ellen White should give them a potent figurehead to alleviate the loss of the departing Parris. However, surgery on an injury, which rules her out for the foreseeable, could prove costly and others will need to step up. Coach Nick Cushing. After a trophyless 2017-18, Cushing led City to FA Cup and Continental League Cup titles and his side were one game from an unbeaten season. The football City play isn\u2019t always pretty but it is effective and Cushing\u2019s talent for trusting young players in his title-contending side is admirable. With a much kinder last-32 draw, against Swiss side Lugano, there will be hopes of a strong Champions League campaign. Cushing needs his team to show greater signs of progress to silence doubters. Major ins and outs Alongside White, the excellent centre-back Aoife Mannion joins from Birmingham \u2013 to replace the Arsenal-bound Jen Beattie. The South Korea captain, Lee Geum-min, also joins the forward line while Cushing continues to talent-spot youngsters with the 18-year-old Irish midfielder Tyler Toland also arriving. Star player Kiera Walsh. Shielding the defence and conducting the attack, few have an eye for a pass like Walsh. After a disappointing World Cup, but a stand-out performance against the USA, the 22-year-old will be looking to pick up on the fine form she showed last season that made her a rumoured target of numerous European clubs. Manchester United The club\u2019s Championship-winning campaign served a purpose; to prepare the new side for the top tier. Now that preparation will be put to the test. The defence in particular, which cruised to 11 clean sheets, will come up against the might of the WSL\u2019s finest. When they met WSL level opposition in cup competitions last team, they credibly won three and lost two \u2013 to Arsenal in the Continental Cup and narrowly to Reading in the FA Cup. Stoney has added experience to balance the team, not being held back by loyalty to her \u201chistory-making\u201d youngsters. But whether they gel quickly enough, and how they cope with not being the dominant league force will be the Stoney\u2019s biggest test. Coach Casey Stoney. Has her first season in management under her belt and the seriousness and professionalism of the former England international matched the attitude she was known for on the pitch. Now though, is the next phase of project United and a more comprehensive look at Stoney\u2019s ability to coach through the ups and downs of a competitive league. Major ins and outs The recruitment of the Dutch midfielder Jackie Groenen is United\u2019s biggest coup. While the additions of Birmingham\u2019s Hayley Ladd, the experienced forward Jane Ross from West Ham, Lotta \u00d6kvist from Hammarby and Abbie McManus, who has crossed from the blue half of Manchester, show a serious effort has been made to add grit and experience. Star player Jackie Groenen. The new recruit, a World Cup finalist with the Netherlands, is expected to be the figurehead of Stoney\u2019s side following the departure of captain Alex Greenwood. Reading They finished last season in fifth, one down on the previous campaign but were a dispiriting 13 points off fourth place. There haven\u2019t been major changes to the squad for the new season with Wales\u2019s Angharad James the most notable recruit, joined by two Danish youngsters as well as Maxime Bennink from the Dutch side PEC Zwolle. As for all the mid-table teams, the arrival of Manchester United and Tottenham threaten to rock the boat. Coach Kelly Chambers. The Reading manager took over from the former Arsenal midfielder Jayne Ludlow in 2014 when the latter became Wales manager. Since then Chambers has taken the team from part-time to full and, though they are not title contenders, built a side that can trouble the top. Major ins and outs Angharad James has joined from Everton to bring the Welsh contingent to three while the experienced Gemma Davison has left for Tottenham. Star player Reading may have the Wales captain, Natasha Harding, and England\u2019s Jade Moore in their ranks, but it is the elder Lionesses, Fara Williams, who still provides one of the biggest threats in the Reading attack. With 12 goals last year she finished the third highest goal scorer in the WSL. Tottenham Spurs have overhauled the team before their first season in the top flight. Seven of their nine recruits are from WSL sides with the manager looking to add professional level experience to her ranks. With the team more firmly under the wing of the men\u2019s club, a showpiece north London Derby at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in November illustrating as much, there is a feeling that Spurs are ready to push on a level. Last year wins against Brighton and Yeovil in the Continental Cup showed they can compete against WSL opposition, but a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City once they had escaped the group and a 5-0 thumping by Chelsea in the FA Cup showed they have a way to go before they disrupt things further up the food chain. With a trip to Stamford Bridge on the opening weekend, how much they\u2019ve been able to do to bridge the gap will be there for all to see. Coach Karen Hills. In Hills and the first-team coach, Juan Amoros, Tottenham have a duo who have worked together at the club since 2011. Under Hills, who joined in 2007, the team have climbed from the London and South East Regional Premier division to the Women\u2019s Super League. Major ins and outs The recruitment list is long and includes the goalkeeper Becky Spencer and the defender Ria Percival (both West Ham) as well as the Dutch defender Siri Worm (Everton), Gemma Davison (Reading) while the two forwards Lucy Quinn (Birmingham) and Kit Graham (Charlton) add to the attack. Star player With the likes of Gemma Davison coming in it would be easy to name a new recruit as the star player. But in Ashleigh Neville, Tottenham have a player with pace and skill from left-back to influence games and who was a key part of their drive to promotion. West Ham United Their first season in the top flight ended with the team a respectable seventh and an unexpected FA Cup final. Despite a frustrating defeat to Manchester City, after a strong first-half performance, that Matt Beard\u2019s side reached the Wembley final at the first time of asking (as a top-tier outfit) is incredibly impressive. After putting the team together in eight weeks, he has now had his first chance to give them a big overhaul. West Ham are a team with major ambitions, they want to be competing at the top and climbing the table will be seen as a must. Coach Matt Beard. Few have the WSL credentials of Beard. The two-time WSL winner unseated Arsenal with Liverpool in 2013 and 2014 before moving to the US. On his return, the fiery Cockney led West Ham to an FA Cup final in his maiden season. Major ins and outs Seven in, eight out. Matt Beard has an uncanny ability to pluck gems from the unknown and this season will likely see the same with the likes of Martha Thomas and Courtney Brosnan from Le Havre brought in. Jacynta Galabadaarachchi joins from Perth Glory to test headline writers but Claire Rafferty\u2019s retirement and Jane Ross\u2019s switch to Manchester United means some experience has been lost. Star player Alisha Lehmann. The Swiss forward was nominated for the PFA\u2019s Young Player of the Year award in her first season in English football and her nine goals were a big reason for that.",

      "body": "<p>What perfect timing for The Third Man to step back out of the shadows. Often hailed as the finest film Britain ever made, a 70th anniversary re-release will see it return to cinemas with the government much in the market for symbols of national grandeur. While Boris Johnson has named his favourite film as Dodgeball \u2013 for once, eerily believable \u2013 as the great British breakdown goes on it is easy to imagine him waving a tiny Union Jack at Carol Reed\u2019s majestic noir. </p> <p>It is true, of course, that there could be no better moment for The Third Man to reappear \u2013 just not as a cosy patriotic treat. Rather, it is a cold premonition of no-deal Britain.</p> <p>In that, there is a certain poetry. We are where we are in no small part due to endless British war films convincing a generation born in the 1950s that they had lived through the Blitz and could only be happy back in it. But The Third Man is a postwar movie. American hack writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in Vienna to meet, then mourn, his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles), but the city he finds tells a bitter truth about life after wartime. \u201cSmashed and dreary,\u201d the screenwriter, Graham Greene, wrote in the novella drafted as a treatment.</p> <p>Barring the unexpected, we may still live to see the resemblance. The cosplayers will sputter that Austria was on the losing side in the second world war, ignoring that Britain can\u2019t help but lose the re-enactment, given we\u2019re the only ones fighting it. With Europe declining to drive us into the shelters, no deal provides the solution by dropping a bomb on ourselves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2019/sep/05/the-third-man-behind-the-scenes-film-noir-in-pictures\">The Third Man: behind the scenes of the film noir masterpiece \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reed and Greene show us the future that follows. \u201cThe classic period of the black market,\u201d the voiceover calls it, an ugly scuttle of murky characters and fraught borders, an impoverished place carved up by predatory powers. The screen fills with parallels between then and our soon-to-be now. Official versions of Harry\u2019s death hum with organised disinformation; his lover Anna is a refugee, terrified of being caught with the wrong papers; malign Russian influence lurks.</p> <p>But most of all, there are the vultures. To the crooks Greene found at work in the Viennese debris, the godsend of war was allowing them room to get rich. No Deal will be the same: a once-in-a-lifetime chance to tip a whole country into a handful of pockets. Disaster capitalism is just the modern name. There must be a catastrophe \u2013 because only that upheaval can allow the firesale of public assets and small businesses, the accompanying wave of deregulation, Britain remade as an offshore hidey-hole that asks no questions (and where those who do ask regret it).</p> <p>Enter \u2013 in that deathless flash of nightlight \u2013 Harry Lime. Because what is Lime if not a pioneer disaster capitalist, grasping the opportunities presented by chaos with a stash of tainted penicillin? Now, near the endgame, the point of the past three years is obvious \u2013 making possible the feral economy in which business minds such as Harry thrive, stripped of \u201cred tape\u201d, profit its own unarguable logic. \u201cFree of income tax, old man,\u201d he twinkles.</p> <p>It almost feels too on-the-nose that his racket takes place in the ultimate captive market \u2013 medicine. When the film was first released, the NHS was a year old.

      "bodyText": "What perfect timing for The Third Man to step back out of the shadows. Often hailed as the finest film Britain ever made, a 70th anniversary re-release will see it return to cinemas with the government much in the market for symbols of national grandeur. While Boris Johnson has named his favourite film as Dodgeball \u2013 for once, eerily believable \u2013 as the great British breakdown goes on it is easy to imagine him waving a tiny Union Jack at Carol Reed\u2019s majestic noir. It is true, of course, that there could be no better moment for The Third Man to reappear \u2013 just not as a cosy patriotic treat. Rather, it is a cold premonition of no-deal Britain. In that, there is a certain poetry. We are where we are in no small part due to endless British war films convincing a generation born in the 1950s that they had lived through the Blitz and could only be happy back in it. But The Third Man is a postwar movie. American hack writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in Vienna to meet, then mourn, his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles), but the city he finds tells a bitter truth about life after wartime. \u201cSmashed and dreary,\u201d the screenwriter, Graham Greene, wrote in the novella drafted as a treatment. Barring the unexpected, we may still live to see the resemblance. The cosplayers will sputter that Austria was on the losing side in the second world war, ignoring that Britain can\u2019t help but lose the re-enactment, given we\u2019re the only ones fighting it. With Europe declining to drive us into the shelters, no deal provides the solution by dropping a bomb on ourselves. Reed and Greene show us the future that follows. \u201cThe classic period of the black market,\u201d the voiceover calls it, an ugly scuttle of murky characters and fraught borders, an impoverished place carved up by predatory powers. The screen fills with parallels between then and our soon-to-be now. Official versions of Harry\u2019s death hum with organised disinformation; his lover Anna is a refugee, terrified of being caught with the wrong papers; malign Russian influence lurks. But most of all, there are the vultures. To the crooks Greene found at work in the Viennese debris, the godsend of war was allowing them room to get rich. No Deal will be the same: a once-in-a-lifetime chance to tip a whole country into a handful of pockets. Disaster capitalism is just the modern name. There must be a catastrophe \u2013 because only that upheaval can allow the firesale of public assets and small businesses, the accompanying wave of deregulation, Britain remade as an offshore hidey-hole that asks no questions (and where those who do ask regret it). Enter \u2013 in that deathless flash of nightlight \u2013 Harry Lime. Because what is Lime if not a pioneer disaster capitalist, grasping the opportunities presented by chaos with a stash of tainted penicillin? Now, near the endgame, the point of the past three years is obvious \u2013 making possible the feral economy in which business minds such as Harry thrive, stripped of \u201cred tape\u201d, profit its own unarguable logic. \u201cFree of income tax, old man,\u201d he twinkles. It almost feels too on-the-nose that his racket takes place in the ultimate captive market \u2013 medicine. When the film was first released, the NHS was a year old. Now, it survives as the grand prize in a US trade deal Britons are assured we are first in line for, an army of Harrys poised to sell us an opioid epidemic and health insurance bankruptcies. With his loathing of American empire, Greene would be unsurprised to find Big Pharma circling. Yet at first, his villain sprang from closer to home. In Greene\u2019s original novella, Lime and Martins were not Americans, but British subjects, old pals from private school. Harry\u2019s crimes in Vienna are, we discover, those of a charismatic English scoundrel educated to rig the system. Indeed. It would be interesting to know what the current prime minister makes of Harry Lime \u2013 a habitual liar, his moral failures stuffed behind rogueish affability, an amply scaled betrayer of women, a nihilist and narcissist bulldozing through life with a bone-deep conviction that, as the novella puts it, \u201chis happiness will make the world\u2019s day\u201d. Greene knew the type. He knew the poison in our golf clubs and members bars. The spivs and grotesques now running the country might have stepped whole from his pages, whipping up nationalism while discreetly betting against the pound and arranging second passports. High on the ferris wheel at the ghostly Prater amusement park, Harry prices up the tiny lives below. \u201cWould you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving?\u201d Now, the maths of no deal are only deranged if you value those dots above your investment fund. And we \u2013 car-factory workers, sheep farmers, research scientists, even film critics, all of us \u2013 wander below. The funny thing is that Britain\u2019s greatest film was only ever part British anyway.

Whether this situation should be allowed to continue has become a pressing one for the British Horseracing Authority, following the news that Ismail Mohammed, a trainer based in Newmarket, has been suspended from endurance racing for two years over a doping offence involving testosterone.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://inside.fei.org/system/files/Case%202018-BS18%20-%20SHADDAD%20-%20PR%20and%20Trainer%20-%20Final%20Tribunal%20Decision%20-%2015%20August%202019.pdf\">a decision reached last month</a> by the International Equestrian Federation (FEI), Mohammed was disciplined, along with one other, for a positive test taken from the horse Shaddad at an event in Suffolk last year. The test found 35 nanograms of the anabolic steroid per millilitre of urine taken from the horse, compared to the FEI\u2019s threshold of 20ng. The FEI described testosterone as \u201cone of the most old-school anabolic steroids, which was known to be used in the build-up period for competitions in Endurance\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/04/aidan-obrien-japan-irish-champion-stakes-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe\">Aidan O\u2019Brien considers taking Japan straight to Longchamp</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On behalf of Mohammed, it was argued that the test resulted from human contamination, as Shaddad\u2019s groom was subsequently found to have been using a cream containing testosterone for pain relief on his own shoulders. But an expert witness for the FEI said this was a \u201chighly implausible\u201d explanation for the positive test.</p> \n<p>It was further argued in the trainer\u2019s defence that, as Mohammed was the registered trainer for more than 300 endurance horses at the MRM Stables in Dubai, \u201che did not and could not make decisions for each and every of these horses. In particular, he could not be held accountable for the mistakes of the groom.\u201d But the FEI countered: \u201cIn the UAE in particular, the trainer actually has the main responsibility and control over the horse\u201d and noted that Mohammed had previously been found in breach of the anti-doping rules, although the trainer contended that those cases arose from contaminated feed.</p> \n<p>The end result was that Mohammed was suspended from endurance racing for two years. He still has the right to appeal and declined to comment on the verdict when I phoned him but does not expect to face any consequences from the BHA, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a separate sport\u201d.</p> \n<p>The BHA were tight-lipped when I asked if they would open a disciplinary inquiry into the matter. It was pointed out to me that the FEI verdict can be taken into account when Mohammed\u2019s licence next comes up for renewal but this strikes me as a weak response to such a significant sanction. Given the importance of anti-doping, the BHA cannot just let the matter slide when its licensees are disciplined by other sporting bodies.</p> \n<p>Mohammed might be best known in racing for the exploits of Educate, winner of the John Smith\u2019s Cup three years ago and the Cambridgeshire three years before that. He is due to run Sydney Express at Haydock today.</p> \n<h2>Thursday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/01/jonjo-oneill-jp-mcmanus-jackdaws-castle\">writing encouragingly about Jonjo O\u2019Neill</a> the other day and the Gloucestershire trainer would be on a run of four winners if Tidal Watch had managed to clear the last at Newton Abbot recently. I like 6-1 about his <strong>Allelu Alleluia (4.00)</strong> at Sedgefield, when the horse returns to hurdles.</p> \n<p>Thanks to a win at the end of May, his chase rating has gone up to 140, so of course O\u2019Neill is tempted to try him again over hurdles, in which sphere he\u2019s 124. He\u2019s not as good over the smaller obstacles, of course, but he might be good enough to win this and it\u2019s worth noting that he\u2019s had a wind operation since his handful of previous handicap hurdle attempts. The market prefers Hepijeu but his recent wins have also been over fences and he\u2019s a stone higher than his last hurdles success.</p> \n<p><strong>Panic Room (2.50) </strong>might be the pick of the Haydock card, with cheekpieces on to help Tom Dascombe\u2019s charge in this novice contest that follows two promising efforts. He\u2019s been supported but 9-4 is still available.</p> \n<p>You can get 4s about Jessie Harrington\u2019s <strong>Millisle (3.40)</strong>, trying to plunder the Dick Poole at Salisbury. The way she finished to win over five furlongs last time suggests this six is what she needs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"94bc16fc-9fbc-4f69-a236-2c73c0f90a25\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Chris Cook's racing tips Thursday 5 Sept</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Sedgefield</b> <b>1.30 </b>Akkapenko <b>2.00</b> Bannixtown Glory <b>2.30</b> Isaac Wonder <b>3.00</b> Nayati <br> <b>3.30</b> My Renaissance <b>4.00</b> Allelu Alleluia (nap) <b>4.30</b> Dounyapour&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Haydock</b> <b>1.50</b> Arabist <b>2.20</b> Oakenshield (nb) <br> <b>2.50 </b>Panic Room <b>3.20</b> Illumined <b>3.50</b> Mizaah <br> <b>4.20</b> Sinjaari <b>4.55</b> Mauricio&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Salisbury</b> <b>2.10</b> Flying Dragon <b>2.40</b> Sea Trout Reach<b> 3.10</b> Tadreej <b>3.40</b> Millisle <b>4.10</b> Betsey Trotter <b>4.40</b> Light Up Our Stars&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield</b> <b>4.15</b> Muhallab <b>4.45</b> Fighting Temeraire <b>5.20</b> Illusionist <b>5.50</b> Crime Of Passion <b>6.20</b> Cotton Club <b>6.50</b> Lady Mascara <b>7.20</b> High Commissioner&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Chelmsford</b> <b>5.40</b> Pettinger <b>6.10</b> Inflamed <br> <b>6.40</b> Keep On Laughing <b>7.10</b> Muhaarar\u2019s Nephew&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>7.40</b> Junooh <b>8.10</b> Cosmic Landscape <br> <b>8.40</b> Swell Song&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

He still has the right to appeal and declined to comment on the verdict when I phoned him but does not expect to face any consequences from the BHA, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a separate sport\u201d. The BHA were tight-lipped when I asked if they would open a disciplinary inquiry into the matter. It was pointed out to me that the FEI verdict can be taken into account when Mohammed\u2019s licence next comes up for renewal but this strikes me as a weak response to such a significant sanction. Given the importance of anti-doping, the BHA cannot just let the matter slide when its licensees are disciplined by other sporting bodies. Mohammed might be best known in racing for the exploits of Educate, winner of the John Smith\u2019s Cup three years ago and the Cambridgeshire three years before that. He is due to run Sydney Express at Haydock today. Thursday\u2019s best bets I was writing encouragingly about Jonjo O\u2019Neill the other day and the Gloucestershire trainer would be on a run of four winners if Tidal Watch had managed to clear the last at Newton Abbot recently. I like 6-1 about his Allelu Alleluia (4.00) at Sedgefield, when the horse returns to hurdles. Thanks to a win at the end of May, his chase rating has gone up to 140, so of course O\u2019Neill is tempted to try him again over hurdles, in which sphere he\u2019s 124. He\u2019s not as good over the smaller obstacles, of course, but he might be good enough to win this and it\u2019s worth noting that he\u2019s had a wind operation since his handful of previous handicap hurdle attempts. The market prefers Hepijeu but his recent wins have also been over fences and he\u2019s a stone higher than his last hurdles success. Panic Room (2.50) might be the pick of the Haydock card, with cheekpieces on to help Tom Dascombe\u2019s charge in this novice contest that follows two promising efforts. He\u2019s been supported but 9-4 is still available. You can get 4s about Jessie Harrington\u2019s Millisle (3.40), trying to plunder the Dick Poole at Salisbury. The way she finished to win over five furlongs last time suggests this six is what she needs.",

Edouard Herriot</a>, delivered a lecture in Vienna last night on the subject of The United States of Europe. The meeting, which was presided over by the leader of the Pan-European movement, Count Coudenhove-Kalergi, lasted 1\u00bd hours, and the ex-Prime Minister tried to explain the practical possibilities of a Pan-European solution to Europe\u2019s problems such as had been proposed by M. Briand.</p> <p>M. Herriot thought that the unity of Europe could be realised through analysis rather than through synthesis. The leading men of Europe, he said, must come together and attempt to eliminate the existing barriers. Many people were still opposed to the idea, but M. Herriot said they had not discovered that in the meantime the movement towards European unity had made great progress and that we were approaching its realisation, especially through economic means such as cartels and trusts.</p> <p>There were, generally, three objections raised against the idea of a United States of Europe \u2013 namely, the American, the Russian, and the British objections. M. Herriot did not consider the American objection to be real because Senator Borah and others had assured M. Briand of their approval of his scheme. America had a cardinal interest in Europe\u2019s recovery at as early a data as possible. Russia, which at present considered the scheme bourgeois, would gladly join in one a day, and as to England, M. Herriot expressed his conviction that Great Britain had no wish to oppose an European settlement. The proof of this contention was, said M. Herriot, that England was willing to participate in the coal inquiry at Geneva with proposals to solve this question from an all-European point of view. Naturally, the United States of Europe had to be created mainly on economic lines and should not touch the sovereignty of the various nations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2018/jun/14/kellogg-briand-pact-outlaw-war-paris-1928\">The Kellogg-Briand pact: world treaty to outlaw war \u2013\u00a0archive, 1928</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Editorial: The Union of Europe</h2> <p>18 July 1930<br><br>The British Government has been one of the last to reply to the Memorandum which M. Briand addressed to the European Powers last May inviting their consideration of his suggestions for what has been grandiloquently, and most misleadingly, described as a United States of Europe. The reply when it does come is of a \u201cpreliminary and tentative kind,\u201d since the British Government has not had the opportunity to consult with the Governments of the Dominions. Nevertheless the British Government has felt no difficulty about expressing certain far-reaching criticism of M. Briand\u2019s proposals.</p> <p>Broadly, the British Note agrees with M. Briand\u2019s aims and disagrees fundamentally with his methods. This disagreement is expressed with a clarity and decision which many will find refreshing. M. Briand\u2019s aim is to divert European States from the barren contemplation of past enmities to constructive co-operation in the tasks of peace, especially in the economic field. That statement of time is not one to which anybody could take exception. It is a platitude. The only question is whether the machinery M. Briand suggests will have the effect which is desired or the opposite effect. The British Government holds that so far from diminishing it might actually tend to increase confusion and rivalry not only in Europe but in the world at large.</p> <p>The reasons it gives for this criticism are not difficult to understand. The first and chief reason is that M. Briand proposes to set up an organisation independent of the League of Nations to do what in essentially the League\u2019s work. That is a fundamental objection, and it is surprising that it should not have occurred to M. Briand. Perhaps it did, for M. Briand was careful to argue that his proposed European Union ought to work in harmony with the League. Nevertheless what he actually proposed to set up was an organisation modelled on the League but entirely independent of it. There would be no organic connection whatever between the two bodies. It is an excellent thing that the British Government should have grasped this cardinal point and put it firmly in the forefront of its criticisms. If there is to be a Union of Europe it must be a union definitely subordinate to the wider union of the League.</p> <p>Apart from that, is it desirable to organise an independent and exclusive European Union? The British Note points to the obvious danger that such an organisation might emphasise what it calls inter-continental rivalries, by which it apparently means European rivalry with the United States of America and with the British Commonwealth. This is another objection hardly less vital than the first. But it is not quite so easily established. Since nobody objects to the existence of the United States of America or of the British Commonwealth (which are on excellent terns with one another), why should not a third group be organised and remain in friendly relationship with the first two? There is, perhaps, no real reason why it should not. But in fact, all schemes of European union derive their chief strength from the notion that union would increase Europe\u2019s power of resistance, especially to the economic domination of America. The appeal is almost exactly parallel to the appeal for tightening the economic union of the British Commonwealth, and is open to the same dangers and objections. In both cases there is an element of genuine idealism, and it is perfectly true that economic union within the Empire, as within Europe is a thing greatly to be desired.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/09/why-we-must-not-let-europe-break-apart\">Why we must not let Europe break apart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are one or two things which M. Briand could have said which might have led one to a different conclusion. But he was careful not to say them. He might have said that the basis of European union should be European disarmament, or European Free Trade. Either of these suggestions would have been a real contribution to the cause of peace. But he said that political questions came first and that economic progress must wait, like disarmament, upon security. There is, therefore, no change there. M. Briand is only saying what every French Foreign Minister has always said before the League of Nations. Still more sensationally, M. Briand might have argued that the time had come for European States to merge themselves in a truly federal system. That would have involved some sacrifice of their independence, and M. Briand was careful to say that sovereign rights most be retained intact. No true federation is therefore possible or even contemplated. Or M. Briand might have argued that it would be well to bring into his European system those semi-European States (Russia, and Turkey) which are not members of the League. But he declined to make even that small innovation. It is difficult, therefore, to find anything new or hopeful in his proposals. They have now been criticised from various angles by most of the leading European Powers, and it would be matter for neither surprise nor regret if the answer of the British Government led to their final abandonment before the next meeting of the League Assembly.</p> <p>This is an edited extract. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/09/04/18_July_1920.jpg\">Read the article in full.</a></p>",

The meeting, which was presided over by the leader of the Pan-European movement, Count Coudenhove-Kalergi, lasted 1\u00bd hours, and the ex-Prime Minister tried to explain the practical possibilities of a Pan-European solution to Europe\u2019s problems such as had been proposed by M. Briand. M. Herriot thought that the unity of Europe could be realised through analysis rather than through synthesis. The leading men of Europe, he said, must come together and attempt to eliminate the existing barriers. Many people were still opposed to the idea, but M. Herriot said they had not discovered that in the meantime the movement towards European unity had made great progress and that we were approaching its realisation, especially through economic means such as cartels and trusts. There were, generally, three objections raised against the idea of a United States of Europe \u2013 namely, the American, the Russian, and the British objections. M. Herriot did not consider the American objection to be real because Senator Borah and others had assured M. Briand of their approval of his scheme. America had a cardinal interest in Europe\u2019s recovery at as early a data as possible. Russia, which at present considered the scheme bourgeois, would gladly join in one a day, and as to England, M. Herriot expressed his conviction that Great Britain had no wish to oppose an European settlement. The proof of this contention was, said M. Herriot, that England was willing to participate in the coal inquiry at Geneva with proposals to solve this question from an all-European point of view. Naturally, the United States of Europe had to be created mainly on economic lines and should not touch the sovereignty of the various nations. Editorial: The Union of Europe 18 July 1930 The British Government has been one of the last to reply to the Memorandum which M. Briand addressed to the European Powers last May inviting their consideration of his suggestions for what has been grandiloquently, and most misleadingly, described as a United States of Europe. The reply when it does come is of a \u201cpreliminary and tentative kind,\u201d since the British Government has not had the opportunity to consult with the Governments of the Dominions. Nevertheless the British Government has felt no difficulty about expressing certain far-reaching criticism of M. Briand\u2019s proposals. Broadly, the British Note agrees with M. Briand\u2019s aims and disagrees fundamentally with his methods. This disagreement is expressed with a clarity and decision which many will find refreshing. M. Briand\u2019s aim is to divert European States from the barren contemplation of past enmities to constructive co-operation in the tasks of peace, especially in the economic field. That statement of time is not one to which anybody could take exception. It is a platitude. The only question is whether the machinery M. Briand suggests will have the effect which is desired or the opposite effect. The British Government holds that so far from diminishing it might actually tend to increase confusion and rivalry not only in Europe but in the world at large. The reasons it gives for this criticism are not difficult to understand. The first and chief reason is that M. Briand proposes to set up an organisation independent of the League of Nations to do what in essentially the League\u2019s work. That is a fundamental objection, and it is surprising that it should not have occurred to M. Briand. Perhaps it did, for M. Briand was careful to argue that his proposed European Union ought to work in harmony with the League. Nevertheless what he actually proposed to set up was an organisation modelled on the League but entirely independent of it. There would be no organic connection whatever between the two bodies. It is an excellent thing that the British Government should have grasped this cardinal point and put it firmly in the forefront of its criticisms. If there is to be a Union of Europe it must be a union definitely subordinate to the wider union of the League. Apart from that, is it desirable to organise an independent and exclusive European Union? The British Note points to the obvious danger that such an organisation might emphasise what it calls inter-continental rivalries, by which it apparently means European rivalry with the United States of America and with the British Commonwealth. This is another objection hardly less vital than the first. But it is not quite so easily established. Since nobody objects to the existence of the United States of America or of the British Commonwealth (which are on excellent terns with one another), why should not a third group be organised and remain in friendly relationship with the first two? There is, perhaps, no real reason why it should not. But in fact, all schemes of European union derive their chief strength from the notion that union would increase Europe\u2019s power of resistance, especially to the economic domination of America. The appeal is almost exactly parallel to the appeal for tightening the economic union of the British Commonwealth, and is open to the same dangers and objections. In both cases there is an element of genuine idealism, and it is perfectly true that economic union within the Empire, as within Europe is a thing greatly to be desired. There are one or two things which M. Briand could have said which might have led one to a different conclusion. But he was careful not to say them. He might have said that the basis of European union should be European disarmament, or European Free Trade. Either of these suggestions would have been a real contribution to the cause of peace. But he said that political questions came first and that economic progress must wait, like disarmament, upon security. There is, therefore, no change there. M. Briand is only saying what every French Foreign Minister has always said before the League of Nations. Still more sensationally, M. Briand might have argued that the time had come for European States to merge themselves in a truly federal system. That would have involved some sacrifice of their independence, and M. Briand was careful to say that sovereign rights most be retained intact. No true federation is therefore possible or even contemplated. Or M. Briand might have argued that it would be well to bring into his European system those semi-European States (Russia, and Turkey) which are not members of the League. But he declined to make even that small innovation. It is difficult, therefore, to find anything new or hopeful in his proposals. They have now been criticised from various angles by most of the leading European Powers, and it would be matter for neither surprise nor regret if the answer of the British Government led to their final abandonment before the next meeting of the League Assembly.

What are his options?</p> \n<h2>Try again to call an election under the Fixed-term Parliament Act</h2> \n<p>This seems most likely, and could happen on Monday, after the rebel backbench bill receives royal assent, but before parliament is prorogued. Under the FTPA, passed in 2011, breaking the set five-year gap between elections needs two-thirds of MPs \u2013 434 of them \u2013 to back the plan. When Johnson tried it on Wednesday night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/cornered-boris-johnson-suffers-triple-commons-defeat\">only 298 did</a>, with opposition MPs mainly abstaining. Things could be different on Monday \u2013 Labour say they want an election, but only after no-deal Brexit on 31 October is ruled out. However, even if Jeremy Corbyn feels sufficiently reassured following the passing of the bill, he could still seek a later election than the 15 October date sought by Johnson.</p> \n<h2>Attempt another method to call an election</h2> \n<p>One mooted alternative plan would be for the government to try to pass a simple one-line bill amending the FTPA to say that in this one instance, an election would happen. The advantage for Johnson would be that this would need a simple Commons majority to pass, meaning a handful of opposition rebels could sway it. However, No 10 is not keen on the idea for one reason \u2013 any such bill could be amended by the opposition, for example to set a particular election date that Johnson might not want. Some have mischievously suggested other amendments could include extending the vote to 16-year-olds and EU nationals \u2013 this wouldn\u2019t happen, but it illustrates the can of worms that could be opened.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/election-scenarios-zip/giv-39020k5joY3JpByM/\" data-alt=\"graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/election-scenarios-zip/giv-39020k5joY3JpByM/\">graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Call a confidence vote in his government</h2> \n<p>This was, in the era before the FTPA, the nuclear option for a beleaguered prime minister \u2013 call a confidence vote in which MPs could back the PM or face an immediate election. These days it is less straightforward. The FTPA does give provision for the opposition to call a confidence vote, and while in theory this could be done by the government, it would be seen as unusual. In this case it could end up in the bizarre situation of Johnson and his MPs voting against his own administration, with Labour supporting it. But even if it passed, the FTPA does not stipulate an immediate election, but a 14-day period where an alternative government could be formed. Johnson could thus face being replaced by a caretaker administration headed by Corbyn \u2013 or even someone like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/hammond-clashes-with-johnson-in-run-up-to-commons-showdown\">newly</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/hammond-clashes-with-johnson-in-run-up-to-commons-showdown\"> purged</a> Kenneth Clarke.</p> \n<h2>\u201cStew in his own juice\u201d</h2> \n<p>This is the phrase used by some in Labour for what they would like Corbyn\u2019s tactics to be \u2013 only seek a general election for after 31 October, and in the interim allow Johnson to get by with no majority, albeit also with a five-week suspension of parliament from the start of next week. However, there could be advantages here for Johnson, for example time to hammer home his key messages that Corbyn is scared of an election, and that he is being frustrated by a remain-minded parliament in delivering Brexit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c4ad9ce6-3cda-4a5e-8ba3-5b6253ec48c1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ks9XnbesWCo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Attempt another method to call an election One mooted alternative plan would be for the government to try to pass a simple one-line bill amending the FTPA to say that in this one instance, an election would happen. The advantage for Johnson would be that this would need a simple Commons majority to pass, meaning a handful of opposition rebels could sway it. However, No 10 is not keen on the idea for one reason \u2013 any such bill could be amended by the opposition, for example to set a particular election date that Johnson might not want. Some have mischievously suggested other amendments could include extending the vote to 16-year-olds and EU nationals \u2013 this wouldn\u2019t happen, but it illustrates the can of worms that could be opened. Call a confidence vote in his government This was, in the era before the FTPA, the nuclear option for a beleaguered prime minister \u2013 call a confidence vote in which MPs could back the PM or face an immediate election. These days it is less straightforward. The FTPA does give provision for the opposition to call a confidence vote, and while in theory this could be done by the government, it would be seen as unusual. In this case it could end up in the bizarre situation of Johnson and his MPs voting against his own administration, with Labour supporting it. But even if it passed, the FTPA does not stipulate an immediate election, but a 14-day period where an alternative government could be formed. Johnson could thus face being replaced by a caretaker administration headed by Corbyn \u2013 or even someone like the newly purged Kenneth Clarke. \u201cStew in his own juice\u201d This is the phrase used by some in Labour for what they would like Corbyn\u2019s tactics to be \u2013 only seek a general election for after 31 October, and in the interim allow Johnson to get by with no majority, albeit also with a five-week suspension of parliament from the start of next week. However, there could be advantages here for Johnson, for example time to hammer home his key messages that Corbyn is scared of an election, and that he is being frustrated by a remain-minded parliament in delivering Brexit.",

Labour\u2019s calculation \u201cwill be that Johnson\u2019s broken promise \u2013 \u2018We leave on 31 October, do or die\u2019 \u2013 will be punished by voters,\u201d the paper predicted. But, it said, Johnson\u2019s opponents \u201ccannot rely on that. His election platform will be a brutal anti-EU campaign with a clear no-deal promise. And faced with a devoted rightwing media, growing voter frustration and an opposition that still does not know which Brexit it wants, his prospects for success are very good.\u201d De Volkskrant said Johnson had become \u201ca zombie prime minister\u201d, blocked by the Commons both from maintaining a no-deal Brexit as an option and from holding elections on 15 October, and facing an increasingly rebellious party. \u201cWith no deal off the table for the time being but no elections yet, Johnson is stuck, just like Theresa May before him,\u201d the Dutch paper said. \u201cThe Kinnock amendment, which could bring May\u2019s agreement back for a fourth vote, may be small lifebuoy. But it was adopted automatically after the government neglected to provide tellers \u2013 an incident that summed up British politics in 2019.\u201d Belgium\u2019s Le Soir said Britain was \u201cin uncharted waters\u201d. Johnson had been \u201ccheckmated by parliament and is without a majority\u201d, the paper said. \u201cNow he has been refused the early elections that he demanded. The future of Brexit \u2013 and of the country \u2013 has never been more uncertain.\u201d The Irish Times took a look at the state of the Conservative party, which it said \u201ccan no longer lay claim to its \u2018strong and stable\u2019 mantra \u2026 It is some feat to make Corbyn look like a statesman, but the man who imagines himself after the great leaders of the ages past has managed just that.\u201d The Tory rebels \u201chave emerged as the real champions of conservatism\u201d, the paper argued. \u201cCameron\u2019s referendum has finally united the Tories. But it managed to unite the wrong ones behind the wrong position. Johnson might believe he\u2019s won a battle \u2013 but parliament and the Tory rebels will certainly win the war.\u201d",

It is hard to see breakfast meetings, or scarfing a sandwich while staring at a screen, as anything other than a sign that our leisure time is being swallowed by capitalism\u2019s gaping maw. Nevertheless, tucking in at work can be the silver lining in a stressful day. Here is a countdown of the 10 best moments.</p> <h2><strong>10. Christmas canap</strong><strong>es</strong><br></h2> <p>Most refreshments found gliding around the office at the Christmas do are, it\u2019s true, shocking. But how else to work out the next steps in your career? There is no quicker way of gauging your job satisfaction than by observing how forgiving you feel towards \u2013 or how personally victimised you feel by \u2013 the crappy crudit\u00e9 selection.</p> <h2><strong>9. Judging colleagues\u2019 food habits</strong><br></h2> <p>OK, sneering at others does not exactly showcase the best of the human spirit. Nonetheless, there are few more effective ways of working through your antipathy toward a colleague than by (inwardly) mocking their food habits. No, we are not what we eat; just because your annoyingly perfect superior meticulously counts out eight almonds for their 4pm snack, it does not mean they are no fun at parties. Still, it makes you feel better to privately pretend that\u2019s the case.</p> <p>A sister activity \u2013 one that is similarly mean-spirited yet rewarding \u2013 is competitive meal prep. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely an element of competitiveness to bringing in food,\u201d says publicity manager Millie Seaward, while Hanna Kenne, who works in publishing, admits she cooks something to bring in \u201cto make my colleagues jealous\u201d. In the office top-dog stakes, it is of little consequence that you recently saved the company from ruin \u2013 unless you can also rustle up an aesthetically pleasing aubergine bake.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jan/10/the-new-rules-of-eating-al-desko\">The new rules of eating al desko</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>8.

But, oh boy, isn\u2019t it a hoot when a) it doesn\u2019t go wrong, and you can get smashed at your desk, or b) it does go wrong, but for someone else? Harry Wheeler, a senior manager at a tech company, merrily recalls a colleague taking \u201ca running dive at a giant beanbag\u201d during happy hour, only to \u201cfaceplant into the floor with a loud crunch\u201d. An emergency dentist was required the next morning \u2013 as was a new front tooth.</p> <h2><strong>7. Smug breakfasts</strong><br></h2> <p>True organisation involves getting up early enough to breakfast at home. But you can ape the optics of someone who has their act together by arriving promptly and enjoying a serene breakfast at your desk.

The time-saving lunch</strong><br></h2> <p>Kenne admits to working through lunch \u201cpartly so I feel better about nipping out for takeaway coffee\u201d. This is also known as the Slacking-Offsetting lunch. Tucking into a Tupperware container at your desk is, really, no great sacrifice. In many ways, the office provides ideal mealtime conditions: shelter from the elements; no need to feel sheepish about consuming food prepared at home, as you would in a cafe. Capitalise on this, and thereby bank goodwill for when you \u201crun an errand\u201d* later in the afternoon.</p> <h2><strong>5. Group picnics</strong><br></h2> <p>Your team spend the winter months attributing their antisocial tendencies to the weather. If it were warmer, you would definitely spend lunchtime hanging out in the park, you all agree \u2013 before going back to scrolling in silence. When summer does arrive, you switch to blaming the heat. Nevertheless, there is always one sunny day when an outdoorsy type insists you go for a picnic. It\u2019s great. Fun! Relaxed! Someone buys you an ice lolly. Better still, you know it won\u2019t happen again for another 365 days.</p> <h2><strong>4. Going solo</strong><br></h2> <p>Thom Ward works in the Singapore office of a British insurance company, where \u201clunch is a 90-minute commitment\u201d and everyone eats out together every day. He prefers to grab something solo. \u201cIf I go with people it means I have to eat where they want to eat,\u201d he says. There is sometimes no greater feeling than \u201cforgetting\u201d a group lunch \u2013 and then slinking out later for a feast for one. A team-bonding session in C\u00f4te? Pff. You can have a samosa and five chocolate lollipops.</p> <h2><strong>3. Hungover brunches</strong><br></h2> <p>You were out until the small hours. Instead of jabbing at a photocopier, you long to be lying in a cool bath, ideally while watched over by a kindly medical professional. But, hang on, perhaps your deskmate is feeling similarly \u201cpeaky\u201d, judging by the sheen of perspiration on her forehead. Ten minutes later, the two of you are inhaling carbs at the cafe down the road, gleeful in the knowledge that you are being paid to be hungover \u2013 and to mainline hash browns.</p> <h2><strong>2. Tea breaks</strong><br></h2> <p>Lucy Eckley, a communications consultant, says that what she misses most about working in an office is \u201chaving someone to go for impromptu coffee and chats with\u201d. She is right; the tea and coffee break is a true luminary in the office eating (OK, drinking) pantheon. It is boss-approved downtime (as long as you remember their earl grey) and sociable without taking too long.

      "bodyText": "Eating in the office is not usually considered one of life\u2019s great treats. It is hard to see breakfast meetings, or scarfing a sandwich while staring at a screen, as anything other than a sign that our leisure time is being swallowed by capitalism\u2019s gaping maw. Nevertheless, tucking in at work can be the silver lining in a stressful day. Here is a countdown of the 10 best moments. 10. Christmas canapes Most refreshments found gliding around the office at the Christmas do are, it\u2019s true, shocking. But how else to work out the next steps in your career? There is no quicker way of gauging your job satisfaction than by observing how forgiving you feel towards \u2013 or how personally victimised you feel by \u2013 the crappy crudit\u00e9 selection. 9. Judging colleagues\u2019 food habits OK, sneering at others does not exactly showcase the best of the human spirit. Nonetheless, there are few more effective ways of working through your antipathy toward a colleague than by (inwardly) mocking their food habits. No, we are not what we eat; just because your annoyingly perfect superior meticulously counts out eight almonds for their 4pm snack, it does not mean they are no fun at parties. Still, it makes you feel better to privately pretend that\u2019s the case. A sister activity \u2013 one that is similarly mean-spirited yet rewarding \u2013 is competitive meal prep. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely an element of competitiveness to bringing in food,\u201d says publicity manager Millie Seaward, while Hanna Kenne, who works in publishing, admits she cooks something to bring in \u201cto make my colleagues jealous\u201d. In the office top-dog stakes, it is of little consequence that you recently saved the company from ruin \u2013 unless you can also rustle up an aesthetically pleasing aubergine bake. 8. Office boozing Drinking at work can go wrong as often as it can go right. But, oh boy, isn\u2019t it a hoot when a) it doesn\u2019t go wrong, and you can get smashed at your desk, or b) it does go wrong, but for someone else? Harry Wheeler, a senior manager at a tech company, merrily recalls a colleague taking \u201ca running dive at a giant beanbag\u201d during happy hour, only to \u201cfaceplant into the floor with a loud crunch\u201d. An emergency dentist was required the next morning \u2013 as was a new front tooth. 7. Smug breakfasts True organisation involves getting up early enough to breakfast at home. But you can ape the optics of someone who has their act together by arriving promptly and enjoying a serene breakfast at your desk. Kenne, who starts the day \u201cenjoying a cup of Clipper\u2019s Latin American instant coffee and devouring toast at my desk while lazily going through my emails\u201d. It may not be as impressive as a boiled egg at the crack of dawn \u2013 but to someone who, when they worked in an office, regularly got up too late to even extract a cereal bar from a cupboard on the way out, Kenne sounds like self-discipline incarnate. 6. The time-saving lunch Kenne admits to working through lunch \u201cpartly so I feel better about nipping out for takeaway coffee\u201d. This is also known as the Slacking-Offsetting lunch. Tucking into a Tupperware container at your desk is, really, no great sacrifice. In many ways, the office provides ideal mealtime conditions: shelter from the elements; no need to feel sheepish about consuming food prepared at home, as you would in a cafe. Capitalise on this, and thereby bank goodwill for when you \u201crun an errand\u201d* later in the afternoon. 5. Group picnics Your team spend the winter months attributing their antisocial tendencies to the weather. If it were warmer, you would definitely spend lunchtime hanging out in the park, you all agree \u2013 before going back to scrolling in silence. When summer does arrive, you switch to blaming the heat. Nevertheless, there is always one sunny day when an outdoorsy type insists you go for a picnic. It\u2019s great. Fun! Relaxed! Someone buys you an ice lolly. Better still, you know it won\u2019t happen again for another 365 days. 4.

He prefers to grab something solo. \u201cIf I go with people it means I have to eat where they want to eat,\u201d he says.

You can have a samosa and five chocolate lollipops. 3. Hungover brunches You were out until the small hours. Instead of jabbing at a photocopier, you long to be lying in a cool bath, ideally while watched over by a kindly medical professional. But, hang on, perhaps your deskmate is feeling similarly \u201cpeaky\u201d, judging by the sheen of perspiration on her forehead. Ten minutes later, the two of you are inhaling carbs at the cafe down the road, gleeful in the knowledge that you are being paid to be hungover \u2013 and to mainline hash browns. 2.

Birthday cakes Finally, we come to the crowning glory of office eating: the birthday cake. Perhaps I am just tragically unpopular, but in my experience there is plenty of chance you won\u2019t get a birthday cake from your loved ones in adulthood. Perhaps your housemate will stick a candle in a croissant \u2013 but your humble desire for a chocolate traybake will likely be overlooked. In the office it\u2019s a different story.

      "body": "<p>Never schedule a demolition in St Jacques for the afternoon. Nothing much stirs in the morning in this mainly Gypsy neighbourhood of Perpignan, south-west France, but by 4pm on 27 July last year, when the diggers turned up at Place du Puig, the locals were up \u2013 and full of fire.</p> <p>Sixty of them, furious at what they saw as mystifying recent demolitions in other parts of the neighbourhood, and worried about a conspiracy to force the Gypsy community out of the heart of Perpignan, refused to let the workman pull another lever.</p> <p>Their leader was Alain Gimenez, 54, a former St Jacques bad boy with two nicknames. The first, Nounours (\u201cTeddy Bear\u201d), nods to his cuddly frame, but his fierce and deep-tanned face exudes the charismatic vehemence that fits his second, harder moniker: Lino.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve told the supervisor that if they don\u2019t stop, things are going to get nasty,\u201d Gimenez said.</p> <p>The demolition plan was meant to be just one small piece in the wider regeneration of Perpignan, a city of 120,000 people about 20 miles (32 km) north of the border with Spain. In 2018, seeking to address decrepit living conditions in St Jacques \u2013 one of France\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods, where 60% of households live in poverty \u2013 and other areas of the city, the national government invested in a \u20ac100m (\u00a391m) project to renew the historic centre.</p> <p>Then, in November 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/06/marseille-building-collapse-rescuers-search-for-missing\">two buildings collapsed</a> in the Noailles district of nearby Marseille, killing eight people and provoking international horror at poor housing conditions in major French cities. The Marseille disaster underlined the urgency in Perpignan, and the city pressed ahead with its plan to demolish 483 buildings in St Jacques by 2024, and build 240 new ones.</p> <p>It did not, it seems, reckon with the Gypsies.</p> <h2>\u2018The soul of Perpignan\u2019</h2> <p>The assistant mayor Olivier Amiel, who until recently was in charge of the regeneration, calls them \u201cthe soul of Perpignan\u201d. The medieval street grid of St Jacques is the Gypsies\u2019 raucous enclave, where they make up roughly three-quarters of a population somewhere between 3,000 and 7,000, depending on who you ask: the census can\u2019t accurately assess the neighbourhood.</p> <p>It is not till late afternoon that the streets of St Jacques come to life, shuttered premises opening up to reveal bars and corner shops, overspilling with chatter in the local dialect of <em>gitan</em> (a form of Catalan mixed with the Romani language<em> cal\u00f3</em>). \u201cIt\u2019s another universe up there,\u201d a lifelong Perpignan resident tells me. \u201cYou have to switch off that western, individualistic, orderly part of your brain.\u201d</p> <p>Place du Puig, a lively square at the top of a hill, is the heart of the neighbourhood. The bulldozers were trained specifically on Ilot Puig (\u201cthe Puig block\u201d), a clump of nine buildings that was already earmarked for the wrecking ball after the collapse of a social centre here in 2006, in which one person died and 13 children barely escaped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7cad48bac43b8e96d48961af662db3ab3817460\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7cad48bac43b8e96d48961af662db3ab3817460/0_0_5905_3937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman walks past the steel sheets sealing off the Ilot Puig.

They didn\u2019t like the vagueness of the city\u2019s regeneration plans \u2013 the fuzzy timelines, the lack of information about prospective rents, and above all the total lack of construction to date on 50 other buildings in St Jacques that had already been bulldozed. Was all the urbanism talk emanating from city hall of greater <em>mixit\u00e9</em> (social mix) and \u201cde-densification\u201d really just a euphemism for de-Gypsification?</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve said it,\u201d says Gimenez. \u201c\u2018We have to make 20% of the Gypsy and north African population leave, minimum.\u2019 But they haven\u2019t said the maximum.\u201d It is unclear where he got the number from: the city\u2019s own figures state that 30 families will be rehoused outside the neighbourhood.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What was built wasn\u2019t exceptional \u2013 it\u2019s not palaces or anything \u2013 but it has an overall sense of history</p> <footer> <cite>Jean-Bernard Mathon</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rooted in paranoia or not, the anger led to an unlikely coalition. Gypsy representatives teamed up with counterparts in the neighbourhood\u2019s north African population, with whom there had previously been little love lost after a violent confrontation between members of the two communities in 2005. They were also joined by an assortment of local middle-class groups who are keen to preserve St Jacques\u2019 ragtag architectural heritage and carnival atmosphere: the city is bidding for Unesco world heritage classification, a process that could not be seen to sideline the city\u2019s Gypsies.</p> <p>So when the protesters blocked the bulldozers and barricaded the building site, the wider coalition quickly rallied in support. Spooked by the growing numbers, and by the prospect of full-blown riots, the city\u2019s prefect froze demolition.</p> <p>Something significant had happened. For the first time, the normally apolitical, insular Gypsies had successfully campaigned and cooperated with outside groups. St Jacques was awake.</p> <h2>\u2018A sense of history\u2019</h2> <p>The thing outsiders tend to focus on in St Jacques is the rubbish. It lines the gutters: broken bottles, ringpulls, chocolate-bar wrappers, plaster shards. But the neighbourhood overflows in other ways too. Laundry hangs off the balconies, rumba music courses out of the occasional top window. Names \u2013 Bombom, Peto, Elisabeth, Anais \u2013 are scrawled in permanent marker on doors and walls, giving them a veneer of love and friendship mementoes. Women pushing buggies look almost like orthodox Jews in full-length black shirts, except for the cardigans covered in sequinned slogans. Four-year-olds zip past on motorised minibikes. A cool-looking guy with a guitar says hello: a member of Perpignan Gypsy supergroup Tekameli.</p> <p>The area is incongruous, shambolic, exciting \u2013 and it is this unique ambiance that St Jacques\u2019 defenders want to preserve. From its vantage point on the hill, you can look down over the rather gloomy historic centre of Perpignan, a raffish and secretive city caught between republican France and Catalonia. Generally marginalised and free from most multinational chain stores, it is only <a href=\"https://www.visapourlimage.com/en\">Visa </a><a href=\"https://www.visapourlimage.com/en\">Pour l\u2019Image</a>, the annual photojournalism festival, that puts the city on the international map.</p> <p>As well as the ambiance, the collective wants to preserve St Jacques\u2019 built environment: its tumbledown stacks of rough-hewn townhouses, which prop each other up on 14th-century earth foundations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"87160d7cab7893b368f0937a3a8413c174398881\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87160d7cab7893b368f0937a3a8413c174398881/0_0_5120_3413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gypsies make up roughly three-quarters of St Jacques\u2019 population, which is somewhere between 3,000 and 7,000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gypsies make up roughly three-quarters of St Jacques\u2019 population, which is somewhere between 3,000 and 7,000</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesco Denzel/www.jescodenzel.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat was built wasn\u2019t exceptional \u2013 it\u2019s not palaces or anything \u2013 but it has an overall sense of history, where every edifice has its own particularities,\u201d says Jean-Bernard Mathon, head of the Association for the Preservation of Roussillon Artistic and Historic Heritage.</p> <p>Mathon\u2019s group wants to see renovation, not demolition. It is aghast at the prospect of the brusque, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/31/story-cities-12-paris-baron-haussmann-france-urban-planner-napoleon\">Hausmannian</a> overhaul proposed by the government, which is funding nearly half of the \u20ac100m, with the town hall and regional bodies providing much of the rest.</p> <p>The locals don\u2019t trust the authorities either. At the end of the gully of Rue de Quinze Degr\u00e9s, a series of concrete blocks shields a building site, with a matrix of wooden beams bracing the buildings on either side. An irate-looking pensioner on his porch shakes his walking stick at it: \u201cIt\u2019s been like that for a year, and they do nothing.\u201d Does he trust the municipality to renovate? \u201cThey\u2019re bastards!\u201d</p> <p>The problem for the heritage brigade is the Gypsy community\u2019s own lack of unequivocal support. Whereas the wider collective want to see the decrepit buildings renovated instead of demolished, many Gypsies\u2019 stance is less cut and dried. \u201cNick\u201d Gimenez (real name Jean-Fran\u00e7ois), the uncle of Alain Gimenez, is one of the community patriarchs. He says his community would be happy to accept demolition as long as new social housing replaces it as promised. \u201cWe\u2019re not bothered about heritage,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question for us if that, if they demolish, they rehouse us immediately.\u201d</p> <p>This bet-hedging gives the impression that the Gypsy community sees the heritage campaigners as useful allies in a bigger battle: to keep control of the neighbourhood.</p> <p>It is undeniable that St Jacques is a refuge for Gypsies. And it has always been a place for the excluded. A Middle Ages leper colony, it became the Jewish ghetto after the expulsion of Jews from Spanish Roussillon in 1492. Some current inhabitants claim Gypsies have been on the hill, cresting where the turreted 13th-century Catholic church stands, for centuries. Recorded history suggests most families arrived in the 1940s after the Vichy regime banned nomadism.</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s not that joyful nomadic rootlessness\u2019</h2> <p>The community\u2019s isolation truly began in the 1960s and 1970s, as the historic Gypsy trades \u2013 horse-breeding, scrap-metal-collecting, knife-sharpening \u2013 fell out of favour. A kind of underclass alienation started to creep in, cutting them off from other nearby Gypsy enclaves, as well as their ethnic heritage. \u201cIt\u2019s not that joyful nomadic rootlessness,\u201d emphasises David Cook, a music producer who lives in St Jacques. \u201cWhere you\u2019re always free to move and discover something else.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I went to school, it was mixed. Now they have classes just for Gypsies. And instead of teaching us to write, they teach us to make pancakes</p> <footer> <cite>Alain Gimenez</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Deprivation has slowly and indelibly pockmarked St Jacques. The average life expectancy here is just 47. Diets dominated by processed food have resulted in widespread obesity and diabetes. Education might be one way out of this, but school enrolment rates are also feeble: only 25% of children attend regularly. A school, La Miranda, was created in 2007 to ease St Jacques youth into the education system, but some argue it has deepened the ghettoising effect of Gypsy-specific classes, which exist in many Perpignan schools. \u201cWhen I went to school, it was French kids, Gypsies and Arabs all mixed,\u201d Alain Gimenez says. \u201cNow they have classes just for Gypsies. And instead of teaching us to write, they teach us to make pancakes.\u201d</p> <p>Unemployment is endemic, too. Youth unemployment runs to 90%. By and large, people in the region will not hire Gypsies. Many receive state benefits. </p> <p>Keeping them further locked into this dependency is their dysfunctional relationship with Perpignan officialdom. There has been a longstanding practice of hiring influential community members for key town-hall roles: Nick Gimenez, for instance, organised St Jacques street-cleaning for several decades.</p> <p>Many believe this clientelism extended to buying votes en masse: the French news magazine L\u2019Express <a href=\"https://www.lexpress.fr/informations/la-dynastie-alduy-remise-en-jeu_640046.html\">has reported</a> how Paul Alduy, Perpignan\u2019s mayor for 34 years until 1993, electorally controlled St Jacques via a fixer named Jacques Farran: \u201cPractically in broad daylight, he bought the Gypsy vote by handing out fistfuls of banknotes.\u201d Le Monde, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/a-la-une/article/2005/06/10/perpignan-un-brasier-mal-eteint_660551_3208.html\">note</a><a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/a-la-une/article/2005/06/10/perpignan-un-brasier-mal-eteint_660551_3208.html\">d that</a> the voting rate leaped from virtually nothing in St Jacques to 80% in the 1970s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38a85cb290f0547680999971d64aedfac524b76b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a85cb290f0547680999971d64aedfac524b76b/0_0_6438_4292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The so-called Ilot du Paradis between Rue du Paradis and Rue des Mercadiers.

Jean-Paul Alduy today dismisses the idea as \u201ccompletely crazy\u201d; he says some Gypsies used their <em>allocation de rentr\u00e9e scolaire</em>, a state benefit for the September return to school,<em> </em>to purchase these goods.</p> <p>\u201cFor them, public money doesn\u2019t come from the state. It\u2019s always something that comes from the town hall,\u201d he says. That was, he says, the origin of the rumour it was the town hall who had bequeathed the new swag. \u201cOne has to admit that everybody has always practised clientelism here,\u201d says Amiel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t want to incite [the Gypsies] to violence, but it\u2019s necessary to put [the prefecture] under pressure</p> <footer> <cite>Romain Grau</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some of the St Jacques Gypsies, without true democratic representation through which to improve living conditions, have sometimes bridled at this deal: in the 2014 municipal elections, Nick Gimenez abruptly switched his political endorsement to the far-right Front National, a party not exactly known for its love of Gypsy culture, allegedly over a dispute with Jean-Marc Pujol, the current mayor, regarding Gimenez\u2019s annual party at the Visa Pour l\u2019Image festival.</p> <p>This toxic interdependency of Perpignan\u2019s political class and the Gypsy community has so far hindered true reform in the neighbourhood. Even over the Ilot Puig block, there were Machiavellian forces at play. The French alternative news site Mediapart <a href=\"https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/200818/perpignan-un-depute-lrem-pousse-des-gitans-troubler-l-ordre-public?onglet=full\">reported</a> that the local representative for the R\u00e9publique En Marche party, Romain Grau, who is the current frontrunner for the city\u2019s 2020 mayoral elections, had encouraged the St Jacques collective to protest.</p> <p>Grau claimed this was necessary to make the prefect intervene on their behalf; \u201cI don\u2019t want to incite [the Gypsies] to violence, but it\u2019s necessary to put [the prefecture] under pressure,\u201d he said. But the report implied he was also using the community to embarrass his political rivals.<strong> </strong>The Gypsies, it seems, were still a handy pawn in Perpignan\u2019s political game.</p> <h2>\u2018Positive gentrification\u2019</h2> <p>Olivier Amiel, the assistant mayor, is adamant that the <em>pas de deux</em> between city and Gypsies must come to an end. \u201cIf the community continues to participate in clientelism, it\u2019s suicidal in view of the social and economic situation,\u201d he says in the Caf\u00e9 de la Loge, across the street from the 14th-century town hall. \u201cAnd if we do it, it\u2019s criminal: we\u2019d be guilty of killing a community.\u201d</p> <p>As head of urbanism, Amiel has been the figurehead of the regeneration plans. It has made him a pariah in St Jacques, but his determination is obvious. The protest \u201chas become something partisan, political, clan-based and even family-based\u201d, he says, sipping a caf\u00e9 noisette.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0239616fbd441aaea19ec0929258df685d5b9151\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0239616fbd441aaea19ec0929258df685d5b9151/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Place du Puig, where protesters gathered to prevent demolitions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Men and children gather on a corner of the Place Du Puig on a hot summer night.

Gimenez rejects the accusation: he insists that far from wanting a job, he turned down several job offers at town hall that he says were offered to him after the protests to buy him off.</p> <p>The 40-year-old Amiel, spindly and debonair in a dark suit, grey hair threaded through his black curls, likes to present himself in the post-Blair progressive mould as the bright young reformer (though he has been recently stripped of his powers after announcing his intention to run for mayor next year.) On his Twitter account, he fanboyishly outs himself as \u201cthe only French politician supported by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/breteastonellis\">Bret Easton Ellis</a>\u201d. After visiting Detroit, another destitute city that tried to bounce back, he wrote a manifesto for \u201cpositive gentrification\u201d.</p> <p>Judging by a video he produced for the municipality, his vision of St Jacques reborn is the stuff of regeneration projects Europe-wide: lots of sanitised, glass-balconied, medium-density flats. When asked about the lack of reconstruction so far in St Jacques, Amiel says the demolitions must happen first. He claims that renovating the entire neighbourhood would be too expensive, citing an average price of \u20ac3,000 per square metre to overhaul the social housing, which would be too much for Gypsy tenants living in poverty to recoup in rent. Demolition and reconstruction would be half the cost, he insists.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The reality, which no one wants to recognise, is that no one wants to buy in St Jacques</p> <footer> <cite>Jean-Marc Pujol</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Besides, he says, beyond preventing other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/07/marseille-building-collapse-fifth-body-found-in-rubble\">Marseille-style house tragedies</a>, he sees regeneration as a broader social project: a way of ending the ghettoisation of St Jacques and the permissive misrule that he thinks has spread in the neighbourhood.</p> <p>Amiel proposes greater <em>mixit\u00e9</em> \u2013 mixing \u2013 as the solution. You wonder how feasible this is. The insularity of many Gypsies here, which is reinforced by the wider prejudice toward its population across southern Europe, has a powerful social gravity all of its own. Aspects of Gypsy culture don\u2019t mix easily with mainstream French culture. For example, girls are often pulled out of school early to ensure they don\u2019t mix with boys, preserving their virginity for marriage. Many of the St Jacques Gypsies say these practices are a part of a culture that nourishes them with an irreplaceable solidarity.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a way of life that, for us, is better than yours,\u201d Alain Gimenez tells me. \u201cI say this to French people: go to a retirement home and you\u2019ll see no Gypsy in there. We keep our old people with us.\u201d</p> <p>This insularity even manifests itself physically on the streets, in what David Cook calls the Gypsies\u2019 \u201cstrange relationship between inside and outside. The insides are spick and span. But all this rubbish must leave this clean space immediately \u2013 so out of the window!\u201d The Gypsy community has established safe boundaries in the neighbourhood, hence the acute suspicion about the town hall\u2019s intentions, particularly the idea of non-Gypsies moving into new apartments. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of critical mass of population that if they fall below it, if it becomes too diluted, their lifestyle is threatened,\u201d says Cook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"32aa8394f12d67ddb2156938c053fcadc685a6df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32aa8394f12d67ddb2156938c053fcadc685a6df/0_0_6656_4438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Youths gather in a car park behind the Caserne St Jacques on the Place du Puig.

That is where the town hall\u2019s communication strategy comes in. The official documents are opaque, full of complex figures and acronyms that are difficult to understand for anyone. Beyond the number of rooms, there is little functional detail about the new housing to excite any future inhabitants. Amiel mentions a series of public consultations, but they have been poorly attended.</p> <p>Word of mouth remains the key medium, via community figureheads such as Gimenez and local evangelical pastors. But that leaves plenty of scope for misinterpretation and manipulation.</p> <h2>\u2018Terrorised by demolition\u2019</h2> <p>Jean-Bernard Mathon, of the heritage brigade, is suspicious of Perpignan\u2019s master regeneration plan.</p> <p>He says there has been widespread use of \u201cinsalubrity orders\u201d, which force landlords to renovate a property but only subsidise 70% of it; if the repairs are not done, the municipality can buy up the property at market rates. He suspects the city wants to demolish as many properties as possible and hand rebuilding straight over to developers.</p> <p>Renovation, he insists, is not being properly explored. He believes it can be done cheaper than the town hall\u2019s estimates, and has asked for an independent evaluation. He also disputes the idea that his group is solely motivated by a middle-class preoccupation with preserving the past: \u201cBeyond the questions of demolition or renovation, you have to take into account the psychological aspect \u2013 people are terrorised by demolition.\u201d</p> <p>Pujol, the mayor, insists the city would prefer not to demolish, and instead to sell expropriated properties to people who would fix them up. \u201cBut there are no buyers,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reality, which no one wants to recognise, is that no one wants to buy in St Jacques.\u201d</p> <p>This may be changing. As Pujol admits, there is a small real-estate buzz at the neighbourhood\u2019s edge; a Paris property company is rumoured to be canvassing residents about selling their houses.</p> <p>What is more, nearly two-thirds of the 236 new buildings planned for St Jacques will be sold on the open market. The remaining 92 units are social housing, but many of the Gypsies believe that it in reality they are destined to be student accommodation: the University of Perpignan\u2019s huge new Campus Mailly development is bringing 1,350 law students right next door to St Jacques in 2020. Amiel denies this, saying the floorplan of the proposed social housing is too large for student use.</p> <p>Whatever the truth, Perpignan\u2019s stealth-gentrification conspiracy theory has taken hold: an insidious plan to raise property values in a dilapidated but historic section of Perpignan while slowly siphoning off its populace, with no one responsible but \u201cthe market\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019ve won\u2019</h2> <p>Abruptly, in April this year, a kind of murky light broke over the Ilot Puig. The Office Public de L\u2019Habitat Public (OPH), the French body responsible for social housing, announced that bids for Perpignan\u2019s redevelopment had gone out to tender \u2013 and also said the option of renovation is back on the table.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve won,\u201d says Alain Gimenez at an outdoor cafe table at Place Cassanyes, St Jacques\u2019 other major square. Nearby, Nasser, the main representative for the collective\u2019s north Africans, is simultaneously sorting out Gimenez\u2019s internet subscription on the phone and selling globe artichokes from a car boot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9fe14e1bfa0f180a6b8c37b6e82257463ddcc4e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe14e1bfa0f180a6b8c37b6e82257463ddcc4e6/0_0_5460_3640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The streets of St Jacques come alive in late afternoon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The streets of St Jacques, such as Rue d\u2019en Calce, pictured, come alive in late afternoon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesco Denzel/www.jescodenzel.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, it also turns out that Gimenez and Nasser have been offered jobs with the OPH \u2013 and both accepted. Gimenez previously insisted he had refused multiple job offers during the campaign. Does this mean he has now been bought?</p> <p>No, he says, slapping the table \u2013 those who\u2019ve suggested this have got it wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how we came to an agreement. We gave the town hall two conditions for the Ilot Puig: one, you renovate the houses there. And two, it\u2019s us who\u2019ll take care of the work and decide who gets to live there. I said to them: don\u2019t try greasing my palms, or I\u2019ll have the mayor for breakfast.\u201d He waves to his grandchildren, who are passing by in a car.</p> <p>The OPH declined to comment on the circumstances and conditions of Gimenez and Nasser\u2019s hiring. The town hall did not respond to questions on the matter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jun/08/corrupt-dangerous-brutal-poor-marseille-future-france\">Corrupt, dangerous and brutal to its poor \u2013 but is Marseille the future of France?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whatever deal they agreed, if any, the fate of Ilot Puig remains uncertain; the results of the tender will be announced in September. Gimenez never argued unequivocally for renovation: could he just be claiming it as a possibility now in order to declare a \u201cvictory\u201d and save face with the rest of the collective? And what of the future of the rest of St Jacques? Gimenez claims he will not stop fighting the demolitions \u2013 \u201cNo, never. The fight will carry on until Pujol has left, and maybe under the next mayor\u201d \u2013 but now that he\u2019s working for a government housing agency intrinsically involved in the redevelopment, it\u2019s hard to see how that would work.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope he means what he says. The Ilot Puig campaign looked like a shot at self-determination for the wider Gypsy community, not just those members who enjoy privileged access to power. If the leaders of the protest abandon it for preferential treatment, this brief window for civic engagement could quickly slam shut. Whether St Jacques is regenerated or renovated, the choice should be the Gypsies\u2019, free from manipulation by ambitious politicians or from the short-term demands of the daily grind.</p> <p>For now, the informal nightlife economy continues to thrive in full view of the old police station, the town hall is still claiming it wants to save the Gypsies, and the mantra of the TV show The Wire continues to apply in Perpignan as it does in cities across the world: it\u2019s all in the game.</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardiancities/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> to join the discussion, catch up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\">our best stories</a> or sign up for our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/03/sign-up-for-the-cityscape-the-best-of-guardian-cities-every-week\">weekly newsletter</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Never schedule a demolition in St Jacques for the afternoon. Nothing much stirs in the morning in this mainly Gypsy neighbourhood of Perpignan, south-west France, but by 4pm on 27 July last year, when the diggers turned up at Place du Puig, the locals were up \u2013 and full of fire. Sixty of them, furious at what they saw as mystifying recent demolitions in other parts of the neighbourhood, and worried about a conspiracy to force the Gypsy community out of the heart of Perpignan, refused to let the workman pull another lever. Their leader was Alain Gimenez, 54, a former St Jacques bad boy with two nicknames. The first, Nounours (\u201cTeddy Bear\u201d), nods to his cuddly frame, but his fierce and deep-tanned face exudes the charismatic vehemence that fits his second, harder moniker: Lino. \u201cWe\u2019ve told the supervisor that if they don\u2019t stop, things are going to get nasty,\u201d Gimenez said. The demolition plan was meant to be just one small piece in the wider regeneration of Perpignan, a city of 120,000 people about 20 miles (32 km) north of the border with Spain. In 2018, seeking to address decrepit living conditions in St Jacques \u2013 one of France\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods, where 60% of households live in poverty \u2013 and other areas of the city, the national government invested in a \u20ac100m (\u00a391m) project to renew the historic centre. Then, in November 2018, two buildings collapsed in the Noailles district of nearby Marseille, killing eight people and provoking international horror at poor housing conditions in major French cities. The Marseille disaster underlined the urgency in Perpignan, and the city pressed ahead with its plan to demolish 483 buildings in St Jacques by 2024, and build 240 new ones. It did not, it seems, reckon with the Gypsies. \u2018The soul of Perpignan\u2019 The assistant mayor Olivier Amiel, who until recently was in charge of the regeneration, calls them \u201cthe soul of Perpignan\u201d. The medieval street grid of St Jacques is the Gypsies\u2019 raucous enclave, where they make up roughly three-quarters of a population somewhere between 3,000 and 7,000, depending on who you ask: the census can\u2019t accurately assess the neighbourhood. It is not till late afternoon that the streets of St Jacques come to life, shuttered premises opening up to reveal bars and corner shops, overspilling with chatter in the local dialect of gitan (a form of Catalan mixed with the Romani language cal\u00f3). \u201cIt\u2019s another universe up there,\u201d a lifelong Perpignan resident tells me. \u201cYou have to switch off that western, individualistic, orderly part of your brain.\u201d Place du Puig, a lively square at the top of a hill, is the heart of the neighbourhood. The bulldozers were trained specifically on Ilot Puig (\u201cthe Puig block\u201d), a clump of nine buildings that was already earmarked for the wrecking ball after the collapse of a social centre here in 2006, in which one person died and 13 children barely escaped. The locals had other ideas. They didn\u2019t like the vagueness of the city\u2019s regeneration plans \u2013 the fuzzy timelines, the lack of information about prospective rents, and above all the total lack of construction to date on 50 other buildings in St Jacques that had already been bulldozed. Was all the urbanism talk emanating from city hall of greater mixit\u00e9 (social mix) and \u201cde-densification\u201d really just a euphemism for de-Gypsification? \u201cThey\u2019ve said it,\u201d says Gimenez. \u201c\u2018We have to make 20% of the Gypsy and north African population leave, minimum.\u2019 But they haven\u2019t said the maximum.\u201d It is unclear where he got the number from: the city\u2019s own figures state that 30 families will be rehoused outside the neighbourhood. Rooted in paranoia or not, the anger led to an unlikely coalition. Gypsy representatives teamed up with counterparts in the neighbourhood\u2019s north African population, with whom there had previously been little love lost after a violent confrontation between members of the two communities in 2005. They were also joined by an assortment of local middle-class groups who are keen to preserve St Jacques\u2019 ragtag architectural heritage and carnival atmosphere: the city is bidding for Unesco world heritage classification, a process that could not be seen to sideline the city\u2019s Gypsies. So when the protesters blocked the bulldozers and barricaded the building site, the wider coalition quickly rallied in support. Spooked by the growing numbers, and by the prospect of full-blown riots, the city\u2019s prefect froze demolition. Something significant had happened. For the first time, the normally apolitical, insular Gypsies had successfully campaigned and cooperated with outside groups. St Jacques was awake. \u2018A sense of history\u2019 The thing outsiders tend to focus on in St Jacques is the rubbish. It lines the gutters: broken bottles, ringpulls, chocolate-bar wrappers, plaster shards. But the neighbourhood overflows in other ways too. Laundry hangs off the balconies, rumba music courses out of the occasional top window. Names \u2013 Bombom, Peto, Elisabeth, Anais \u2013 are scrawled in permanent marker on doors and walls, giving them a veneer of love and friendship mementoes. Women pushing buggies look almost like orthodox Jews in full-length black shirts, except for the cardigans covered in sequinned slogans. Four-year-olds zip past on motorised minibikes. A cool-looking guy with a guitar says hello: a member of Perpignan Gypsy supergroup Tekameli. The area is incongruous, shambolic, exciting \u2013 and it is this unique ambiance that St Jacques\u2019 defenders want to preserve. From its vantage point on the hill, you can look down over the rather gloomy historic centre of Perpignan, a raffish and secretive city caught between republican France and Catalonia. Generally marginalised and free from most multinational chain stores, it is only Visa Pour l\u2019Image, the annual photojournalism festival, that puts the city on the international map. As well as the ambiance, the collective wants to preserve St Jacques\u2019 built environment: its tumbledown stacks of rough-hewn townhouses, which prop each other up on 14th-century earth foundations. \u201cWhat was built wasn\u2019t exceptional \u2013 it\u2019s not palaces or anything \u2013 but it has an overall sense of history, where every edifice has its own particularities,\u201d says Jean-Bernard Mathon, head of the Association for the Preservation of Roussillon Artistic and Historic Heritage. Mathon\u2019s group wants to see renovation, not demolition. It is aghast at the prospect of the brusque, Hausmannian overhaul proposed by the government, which is funding nearly half of the \u20ac100m, with the town hall and regional bodies providing much of the rest. The locals don\u2019t trust the authorities either. At the end of the gully of Rue de Quinze Degr\u00e9s, a series of concrete blocks shields a building site, with a matrix of wooden beams bracing the buildings on either side. An irate-looking pensioner on his porch shakes his walking stick at it: \u201cIt\u2019s been like that for a year, and they do nothing.\u201d Does he trust the municipality to renovate? \u201cThey\u2019re bastards!\u201d The problem for the heritage brigade is the Gypsy community\u2019s own lack of unequivocal support. Whereas the wider collective want to see the decrepit buildings renovated instead of demolished, many Gypsies\u2019 stance is less cut and dried. \u201cNick\u201d Gimenez (real name Jean-Fran\u00e7ois), the uncle of Alain Gimenez, is one of the community patriarchs. He says his community would be happy to accept demolition as long as new social housing replaces it as promised. \u201cWe\u2019re not bothered about heritage,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question for us if that, if they demolish, they rehouse us immediately.\u201d This bet-hedging gives the impression that the Gypsy community sees the heritage campaigners as useful allies in a bigger battle: to keep control of the neighbourhood. It is undeniable that St Jacques is a refuge for Gypsies. And it has always been a place for the excluded. A Middle Ages leper colony, it became the Jewish ghetto after the expulsion of Jews from Spanish Roussillon in 1492. Some current inhabitants claim Gypsies have been on the hill, cresting where the turreted 13th-century Catholic church stands, for centuries. Recorded history suggests most families arrived in the 1940s after the Vichy regime banned nomadism. \u2018It\u2019s not that joyful nomadic rootlessness\u2019 The community\u2019s isolation truly began in the 1960s and 1970s, as the historic Gypsy trades \u2013 horse-breeding, scrap-metal-collecting, knife-sharpening \u2013 fell out of favour. A kind of underclass alienation started to creep in, cutting them off from other nearby Gypsy enclaves, as well as their ethnic heritage. \u201cIt\u2019s not that joyful nomadic rootlessness,\u201d emphasises David Cook, a music producer who lives in St Jacques. \u201cWhere you\u2019re always free to move and discover something else.\u201d Deprivation has slowly and indelibly pockmarked St Jacques. The average life expectancy here is just 47. Diets dominated by processed food have resulted in widespread obesity and diabetes. Education might be one way out of this, but school enrolment rates are also feeble: only 25% of children attend regularly. A school, La Miranda, was created in 2007 to ease St Jacques youth into the education system, but some argue it has deepened the ghettoising effect of Gypsy-specific classes, which exist in many Perpignan schools. \u201cWhen I went to school, it was French kids, Gypsies and Arabs all mixed,\u201d Alain Gimenez says. \u201cNow they have classes just for Gypsies. And instead of teaching us to write, they teach us to make pancakes.\u201d Unemployment is endemic, too. Youth unemployment runs to 90%. By and large, people in the region will not hire Gypsies. Many receive state benefits. Keeping them further locked into this dependency is their dysfunctional relationship with Perpignan officialdom. There has been a longstanding practice of hiring influential community members for key town-hall roles: Nick Gimenez, for instance, organised St Jacques street-cleaning for several decades. Many believe this clientelism extended to buying votes en masse: the French news magazine L\u2019Express has reported how Paul Alduy, Perpignan\u2019s mayor for 34 years until 1993, electorally controlled St Jacques via a fixer named Jacques Farran: \u201cPractically in broad daylight, he bought the Gypsy vote by handing out fistfuls of banknotes.\u201d Le Monde, meanwhile, noted that the voting rate leaped from virtually nothing in St Jacques to 80% in the 1970s. People across Perpignan allege that this electoral malpractice continued in less blatant form under Alduy\u2019s son, Jean-Paul, mayor from 1993 to 2009. L\u2019Express also reported how, following the 1995 municipal elections, St Jacques was awash in brand-new scooters and fridges offered in exchange for the community vote. Jean-Paul Alduy today dismisses the idea as \u201ccompletely crazy\u201d; he says some Gypsies used their allocation de rentr\u00e9e scolaire, a state benefit for the September return to school, to purchase these goods. \u201cFor them, public money doesn\u2019t come from the state. It\u2019s always something that comes from the town hall,\u201d he says. That was, he says, the origin of the rumour it was the town hall who had bequeathed the new swag. \u201cOne has to admit that everybody has always practised clientelism here,\u201d says Amiel. Some of the St Jacques Gypsies, without true democratic representation through which to improve living conditions, have sometimes bridled at this deal: in the 2014 municipal elections, Nick Gimenez abruptly switched his political endorsement to the far-right Front National, a party not exactly known for its love of Gypsy culture, allegedly over a dispute with Jean-Marc Pujol, the current mayor, regarding Gimenez\u2019s annual party at the Visa Pour l\u2019Image festival. This toxic interdependency of Perpignan\u2019s political class and the Gypsy community has so far hindered true reform in the neighbourhood. Even over the Ilot Puig block, there were Machiavellian forces at play. The French alternative news site Mediapart reported that the local representative for the R\u00e9publique En Marche party, Romain Grau, who is the current frontrunner for the city\u2019s 2020 mayoral elections, had encouraged the St Jacques collective to protest. Grau claimed this was necessary to make the prefect intervene on their behalf; \u201cI don\u2019t want to incite [the Gypsies] to violence, but it\u2019s necessary to put [the prefecture] under pressure,\u201d he said. But the report implied he was also using the community to embarrass his political rivals. The Gypsies, it seems, were still a handy pawn in Perpignan\u2019s political game. \u2018Positive gentrification\u2019 Olivier Amiel, the assistant mayor, is adamant that the pas de deux between city and Gypsies must come to an end. \u201cIf the community continues to participate in clientelism, it\u2019s suicidal in view of the social and economic situation,\u201d he says in the Caf\u00e9 de la Loge, across the street from the 14th-century town hall. \u201cAnd if we do it, it\u2019s criminal: we\u2019d be guilty of killing a community.\u201d As head of urbanism, Amiel has been the figurehead of the regeneration plans. It has made him a pariah in St Jacques, but his determination is obvious. The protest \u201chas become something partisan, political, clan-based and even family-based\u201d, he says, sipping a caf\u00e9 noisette. He is not afraid to name names: he accuses Alain Gimenez of rousing the community in revenge for being refused a job with the municipality. Gimenez rejects the accusation: he insists that far from wanting a job, he turned down several job offers at town hall that he says were offered to him after the protests to buy him off. The 40-year-old Amiel, spindly and debonair in a dark suit, grey hair threaded through his black curls, likes to present himself in the post-Blair progressive mould as the bright young reformer (though he has been recently stripped of his powers after announcing his intention to run for mayor next year.) On his Twitter account, he fanboyishly outs himself as \u201cthe only French politician supported by Bret Easton Ellis\u201d. After visiting Detroit, another destitute city that tried to bounce back, he wrote a manifesto for \u201cpositive gentrification\u201d. Judging by a video he produced for the municipality, his vision of St Jacques reborn is the stuff of regeneration projects Europe-wide: lots of sanitised, glass-balconied, medium-density flats. When asked about the lack of reconstruction so far in St Jacques, Amiel says the demolitions must happen first. He claims that renovating the entire neighbourhood would be too expensive, citing an average price of \u20ac3,000 per square metre to overhaul the social housing, which would be too much for Gypsy tenants living in poverty to recoup in rent. Demolition and reconstruction would be half the cost, he insists. Besides, he says, beyond preventing other Marseille-style house tragedies, he sees regeneration as a broader social project: a way of ending the ghettoisation of St Jacques and the permissive misrule that he thinks has spread in the neighbourhood. Amiel proposes greater mixit\u00e9 \u2013 mixing \u2013 as the solution. You wonder how feasible this is. The insularity of many Gypsies here, which is reinforced by the wider prejudice toward its population across southern Europe, has a powerful social gravity all of its own. Aspects of Gypsy culture don\u2019t mix easily with mainstream French culture. For example, girls are often pulled out of school early to ensure they don\u2019t mix with boys, preserving their virginity for marriage. Many of the St Jacques Gypsies say these practices are a part of a culture that nourishes them with an irreplaceable solidarity. \u201cWe have a way of life that, for us, is better than yours,\u201d Alain Gimenez tells me. \u201cI say this to French people: go to a retirement home and you\u2019ll see no Gypsy in there. We keep our old people with us.\u201d This insularity even manifests itself physically on the streets, in what David Cook calls the Gypsies\u2019 \u201cstrange relationship between inside and outside. The insides are spick and span. But all this rubbish must leave this clean space immediately \u2013 so out of the window!\u201d The Gypsy community has established safe boundaries in the neighbourhood, hence the acute suspicion about the town hall\u2019s intentions, particularly the idea of non-Gypsies moving into new apartments. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of critical mass of population that if they fall below it, if it becomes too diluted, their lifestyle is threatened,\u201d says Cook. To break down this entrenchment, the Gypsy community will need to be convinced that the St Jacques plans will benefit them. That is where the town hall\u2019s communication strategy comes in. The official documents are opaque, full of complex figures and acronyms that are difficult to understand for anyone. Beyond the number of rooms, there is little functional detail about the new housing to excite any future inhabitants. Amiel mentions a series of public consultations, but they have been poorly attended. Word of mouth remains the key medium, via community figureheads such as Gimenez and local evangelical pastors. But that leaves plenty of scope for misinterpretation and manipulation. \u2018Terrorised by demolition\u2019 Jean-Bernard Mathon, of the heritage brigade, is suspicious of Perpignan\u2019s master regeneration plan. He says there has been widespread use of \u201cinsalubrity orders\u201d, which force landlords to renovate a property but only subsidise 70% of it; if the repairs are not done, the municipality can buy up the property at market rates. He suspects the city wants to demolish as many properties as possible and hand rebuilding straight over to developers. Renovation, he insists, is not being properly explored. He believes it can be done cheaper than the town hall\u2019s estimates, and has asked for an independent evaluation. He also disputes the idea that his group is solely motivated by a middle-class preoccupation with preserving the past: \u201cBeyond the questions of demolition or renovation, you have to take into account the psychological aspect \u2013 people are terrorised by demolition.\u201d Pujol, the mayor, insists the city would prefer not to demolish, and instead to sell expropriated properties to people who would fix them up. \u201cBut there are no buyers,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reality, which no one wants to recognise, is that no one wants to buy in St Jacques.\u201d This may be changing. As Pujol admits, there is a small real-estate buzz at the neighbourhood\u2019s edge; a Paris property company is rumoured to be canvassing residents about selling their houses. What is more, nearly two-thirds of the 236 new buildings planned for St Jacques will be sold on the open market. The remaining 92 units are social housing, but many of the Gypsies believe that it in reality they are destined to be student accommodation: the University of Perpignan\u2019s huge new Campus Mailly development is bringing 1,350 law students right next door to St Jacques in 2020. Amiel denies this, saying the floorplan of the proposed social housing is too large for student use. Whatever the truth, Perpignan\u2019s stealth-gentrification conspiracy theory has taken hold: an insidious plan to raise property values in a dilapidated but historic section of Perpignan while slowly siphoning off its populace, with no one responsible but \u201cthe market\u201d. \u2018We\u2019ve won\u2019 Abruptly, in April this year, a kind of murky light broke over the Ilot Puig. The Office Public de L\u2019Habitat Public (OPH), the French body responsible for social housing, announced that bids for Perpignan\u2019s redevelopment had gone out to tender \u2013 and also said the option of renovation is back on the table. \u201cWe\u2019ve won,\u201d says Alain Gimenez at an outdoor cafe table at Place Cassanyes, St Jacques\u2019 other major square. Nearby, Nasser, the main representative for the collective\u2019s north Africans, is simultaneously sorting out Gimenez\u2019s internet subscription on the phone and selling globe artichokes from a car boot. However, it also turns out that Gimenez and Nasser have been offered jobs with the OPH \u2013 and both accepted. Gimenez previously insisted he had refused multiple job offers during the campaign. Does this mean he has now been bought? No, he says, slapping the table \u2013 those who\u2019ve suggested this have got it wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how we came to an agreement. We gave the town hall two conditions for the Ilot Puig: one, you renovate the houses there. And two, it\u2019s us who\u2019ll take care of the work and decide who gets to live there. I said to them: don\u2019t try greasing my palms, or I\u2019ll have the mayor for breakfast.\u201d He waves to his grandchildren, who are passing by in a car. The OPH declined to comment on the circumstances and conditions of Gimenez and Nasser\u2019s hiring. The town hall did not respond to questions on the matter. Whatever deal they agreed, if any, the fate of Ilot Puig remains uncertain; the results of the tender will be announced in September. Gimenez never argued unequivocally for renovation: could he just be claiming it as a possibility now in order to declare a \u201cvictory\u201d and save face with the rest of the collective? And what of the future of the rest of St Jacques? Gimenez claims he will not stop fighting the demolitions \u2013 \u201cNo, never. The fight will carry on until Pujol has left, and maybe under the next mayor\u201d \u2013 but now that he\u2019s working for a government housing agency intrinsically involved in the redevelopment, it\u2019s hard to see how that would work. Let\u2019s hope he means what he says. The Ilot Puig campaign looked like a shot at self-determination for the wider Gypsy community, not just those members who enjoy privileged access to power. If the leaders of the protest abandon it for preferential treatment, this brief window for civic engagement could quickly slam shut. Whether St Jacques is regenerated or renovated, the choice should be the Gypsies\u2019, free from manipulation by ambitious politicians or from the short-term demands of the daily grind. For now, the informal nightlife economy continues to thrive in full view of the old police station, the town hall is still claiming it wants to save the Gypsies, and the mantra of the TV show The Wire continues to apply in Perpignan as it does in cities across the world: it\u2019s all in the game.

She\u2019s one of Nashville\u2019s most potent truth-tellers, and if she is less recognisable than fellow travellers Kacey Musgraves and Maren Morris, it is probably because she hasn\u2019t released new music since her 2015 major-label debut, Untamed, which yielded the hit Burning House. That will be rectified this autumn, she informs us, to which one can only respond: bring it on. California-born, she does a remarkable job of fusing west coast liberalism and traditional country tropes during the show. There is a banjo player on stage, and Ochs\u2019s clear, true voice twangs in the right aching places while wearing a silver dress that Dolly Parton would envy. Contrastingly, the warm, engaging set is underpinned by modern dictates: don\u2019t slut-shame, she tells us on the country-pop bop My Mistake, that hails a girl who enjoys every minute of a one-night stand. Introducing it, she says: \u201cI\u2019ve been called \u2018sex positive\u2019, but guys can sing about sex and nobody labels them.\u201d On the furiously percussive Diane, a married man\u2019s girlfriend apologises to his wife. \u201cSing this extra loud so those women get the apology they deserve,\u201d she directs the crowd.

David Luiz might not be performing heroics for Arsenal at the moment, but he has done for Brazil over the years. How did he get this over the bar? If it\u2019s athleticism you appreciate most in a last-ditch clearance, see Kyle Walker and Sven van Beek. Meanwhile, this defender put so much effort into his clearance that he broke the goal in Brazil. Oh, and brilliant goalline clearances are not always performed by humans, either, as this stray dog showed in a third-tier match in Argentina. 2) College football is properly back with a \u2026 well, just watch this. 3) Rafael Nadal couldn\u2019t get the ball over the net in his fourth-round match against Marin Cilic at the US Open \u2026 so he just went round it with an absurd winner. It was brilliant, and even had Tiger Woods fist-pumping in the crowd \u2026 but better than Novak Djokovic\u2019s in 2014? You decide. 4) Bone-crunching NRL tackle alert! Cameron Munster is monstered by Jorge Taufua. 5) Some goals of the week, featuring a couple of bangers here and here and a straight-from-kick-off beauty from Charlton Under-18s\u2019 Aaron Henry. 6) Don\u2019t grow marijuana on rooftops along the Vuelta route.

He quit the job after only eight months, describing Duncan Smith as incompetent.</p>\n    <p>Following the 2010 general election, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, appointed Cummings as his chief of staff. Many in Whitehall found Cummings as difficult as he found them. In 2013, civil servants in the Department for Education&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/dump-fing-everyone-the-inside-story-of-how-michael-gove-s-vicious-attack-dogs-are-terrorising-the-8497626.html\">complained to the Independent</a>&nbsp;of an \u201cus-and-them, aggressive, intimidating culture\u201d created by Cummings and Gove.</p>\n    <p>He never hid his disdain for the workings of Whitehall and has derided Westminster figures in eye-catching&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ally-of-michael-gove-savages-david-cameron-for-bumbling-cw9tqtgdbjt\">media interviews</a>&nbsp;and published&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/\">rambling blogposts</a>&nbsp;that are obsessed over by Westminster insiders.

But the cross-party plan has passed all stages in the Commons, and will now head to the Lords on Thursday. Boris Johnson has maintained his unenviable 100% vote loss record as prime minister, begun on Tuesday night when MPs voted to take control of the agenda and tackle the bill. It passed the second and third readings in a single afternoon, by 327 to 299 and 329 to 300.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/more-than-100000-people-apply-register-vote-youth-uk-general-election\">More than 100,000 apply to register to vote in UK in 48 hours</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Was it amended to bring back Theresa May\u2019s plan?</h2> \n<p>Yes \u2013 and in yet another curious and dramatic twist, this happened without most MPs immediately knowing how or why. An amendment led by Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock, which would resurrect May\u2019s three times-rejected Brexit plan as a possible focus for any extension, looked likely to be defeated in a vote. However, the government did not provide any \u201ctellers\u201d, the MPs who count votes, for their side, the noes. That meant it was passed by default. Whether that was an accident or planned was not clear. However, the amendment did not stop the bill passing the third reading, so MPs seemed unbothered.</p> \n<h2>Is the Lords ready?</h2> \n<p>Yes. After many hours of debate, more than 80 tabled amendments and other delaying tactics by opponents, peers agreed in cross-party talks to return the bill to the Commons by 5pm on Friday. The tortuous process \u2013 which did not end until 1.30am on Thursday \u2013 was not about the bill itself, just clearing the timetable for it to be heard. But with an in-built majority against no deal in the upper house, passing the bill was less of an obstacle.</p> \n<h2>Are we having a general election or not?</h2> \n<p>Johnson reacted to Tuesday night\u2019s defeat by promising to call a vote on having an election on 15 October via the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, allowing governments to break the standard five-year period between polls. But under the act, this requires two-thirds or more of MPs to support the measure. Labour and opposition parties mainly abstained.

      "bodyText": "Have MPs now blocked a no-deal Brexit? No \u2013 not least because the backbench-launched bill on no deal could only ever obstruct it as an option, not entirely remove it. But the cross-party plan has passed all stages in the Commons, and will now head to the Lords on Thursday. Boris Johnson has maintained his unenviable 100% vote loss record as prime minister, begun on Tuesday night when MPs voted to take control of the agenda and tackle the bill. It passed the second and third readings in a single afternoon, by 327 to 299 and 329 to 300. Was it amended to bring back Theresa May\u2019s plan? Yes \u2013 and in yet another curious and dramatic twist, this happened without most MPs immediately knowing how or why. An amendment led by Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock, which would resurrect May\u2019s three times-rejected Brexit plan as a possible focus for any extension, looked likely to be defeated in a vote. However, the government did not provide any \u201ctellers\u201d, the MPs who count votes, for their side, the noes. That meant it was passed by default. Whether that was an accident or planned was not clear. However, the amendment did not stop the bill passing the third reading, so MPs seemed unbothered. Is the Lords ready? Yes. After many hours of debate, more than 80 tabled amendments and other delaying tactics by opponents, peers agreed in cross-party talks to return the bill to the Commons by 5pm on Friday. The tortuous process \u2013 which did not end until 1.30am on Thursday \u2013 was not about the bill itself, just clearing the timetable for it to be heard. But with an in-built majority against no deal in the upper house, passing the bill was less of an obstacle. Are we having a general election or not? Johnson reacted to Tuesday night\u2019s defeat by promising to call a vote on having an election on 15 October via the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, allowing governments to break the standard five-year period between polls. But under the act, this requires two-thirds or more of MPs to support the measure. Labour and opposition parties mainly abstained. The motion won by 298 votes to 44, nowhere near the 430-plus threshold. Why doesn\u2019t Labour want an election now? This was a point made by Johnson at his inaugural prime minister\u2019s questions earlier in the day, calling Jeremy Corbyn \u201cfrightened\u201d. But Labour says it will only back an election when it can be completely sure that Johnson will be unable to force a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The party is consulting lawyers and other opposition parties, which they say is necessary because they do not trust the PM to keep his word or to follow constitutional norms. So when might an election happen? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. Labour is still examining the possible idea of backing Johnson\u2019s 15 October poll in a later vote once the backbench bill has become law, if it is reassured that it can avoid any government ruse to force no deal.

The prop has been a mainstay of the All Blacks\u2019 pack for most of this decade and started two of their three Rugby Championship matches this summer, but he lost out to two younger, far less experienced players with speed around the field cited as a reason. Franks issued a statement denying that he was slowing down while admitting the two tight-heads chosen were quicker than him.</p> <p>This is part of a trend. At 27 the Wales loosehead prop Rob Evans is not in the veteran category but after starting four of Wales\u2019s matches in their grand slam triumph this year he suffered injuries that disrupted his World Cup preparations. He was considered to be lacking the durability needed in Japan and Warren Gatland chose the 21-year-old Rhys Carr\u00e9, whose number of caps equals his number of starts in the Pro14, one, for the World Cup.</p> <p>The England head coach, Eddie Jones, did not have to make a decision over Dylan Hartley, who was not considered because of injury, but by making Owen Farrell co-captain last year and giving him the responsibility of overturning an interval deficit against Japan, he was already leaning that way.</p> <p>When Wales returned from their tour to New Zealand in 2016, the national management called a meeting with the four regional coaches and said they wanted tight five forwards to be far better equipped when it came to running, handling and passing. They recognised that the game was evolving and that set-pieces, while still important, were influencing fewer outcomes.</p> <p>The Bristol back-row Aly Muldowney, <a href=\"https://www.balls.ie/rugby/balls-ie-rugby-podcast-ireland-416700\">in an interview with </a><a href=\"https://www.balls.ie/rugby/balls-ie-rugby-podcast-ireland-416700\">the Irish website</a><a href=\"https://www.balls.ie/rugby/balls-ie-rugby-podcast-ireland-416700\"> Balls.ie</a>, reflected on Toner\u2019s omission. \u201cThe demands on second-rows are increasing and increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to be near level with back-rows who don\u2019t have to scrummage as hard.

      "bodyText": "Brian O\u2019Driscoll knew just how Devin Toner, the 33-year old second-row who had won more caps under the Ireland head coach, Joe Schmidt, than any other player, felt after he was left out of the World Cup squad this week. \u201cHe has been the go-to guy in big games,\u201d said O\u2019Driscoll, who at the age of 34 was dropped from the third Test between the Lions and Australia in Sydney, the first time he had suffered the indignity in his international career. \u201cIt was only 10 months ago that he dominated the lineout in the big victory over New Zealand. It\u2019s quite a fall from grace. If I was Devin I would be feeling very sorry for myself and wondering whether it was justified.\u201d Toner missed the final four rounds of this year\u2019s Six Nations after suffering an ankle injury in the opener and the player who was preferred to him, Jean Kleyn, qualified for Ireland on residency grounds only this summer. The South Africa-born player was part of the lineout that malfunctioned against England last month, but he is seen as offering more in the loose. Owen Franks, meanwhile, was looking forward to his third World Cup. The prop has been a mainstay of the All Blacks\u2019 pack for most of this decade and started two of their three Rugby Championship matches this summer, but he lost out to two younger, far less experienced players with speed around the field cited as a reason. Franks issued a statement denying that he was slowing down while admitting the two tight-heads chosen were quicker than him. This is part of a trend. At 27 the Wales loosehead prop Rob Evans is not in the veteran category but after starting four of Wales\u2019s matches in their grand slam triumph this year he suffered injuries that disrupted his World Cup preparations. He was considered to be lacking the durability needed in Japan and Warren Gatland chose the 21-year-old Rhys Carr\u00e9, whose number of caps equals his number of starts in the Pro14, one, for the World Cup. The England head coach, Eddie Jones, did not have to make a decision over Dylan Hartley, who was not considered because of injury, but by making Owen Farrell co-captain last year and giving him the responsibility of overturning an interval deficit against Japan, he was already leaning that way. When Wales returned from their tour to New Zealand in 2016, the national management called a meeting with the four regional coaches and said they wanted tight five forwards to be far better equipped when it came to running, handling and passing. They recognised that the game was evolving and that set-pieces, while still important, were influencing fewer outcomes. The Bristol back-row Aly Muldowney, in an interview with the Irish website Balls.ie, reflected on Toner\u2019s omission. \u201cThe demands on second-rows are increasing and increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to be near level with back-rows who don\u2019t have to scrummage as hard. Now you have to be way more involved in the game and the same goes for front-rows. Otherwise you just get found out these days when everyone else is so fit.\u201d A breakdown of the squads for the World Cup showed that the tier two and three nations had a greater number of 30-something players than the tier one sides, an average of 11 compared with 8.2. Of the leading sides Wales chose seven and England a mere four, including both their scrum-halves. It was not that long ago that Eddie Jones looked geared to take players such as Mike Brown, Ben Te\u2019o, Danny Care, Chris Robshaw and James Haskell to Japan. They all featured in England\u2019s final match of the 2018 Six Nations, a day when eight of the 23 had reached 30. Jones\u2019s training sessions are high on intensity, with players tracked. He never reveals why someone has been omitted, no matter his contribution in the past; like Gatland, he relies on evidence, of his own eyes and statistical. If age is a factor, it is not the only one. One of the difficulties of selecting a Lions squad is anticipating how players who start for their countries will cope with the disappointment of being on the bench for a Test or, worse, stuck in the stand wearing a shirt and tie. Would a player chosen for the World Cup who had been a first-choice for so long show as much enthusiasm and drive in training when he realised he was likely to start against only the lowest-ranked side in the group as a rookie whose surprise at being included in the squad was as great as his delight? Carr\u00e9 might not start a match in Japan but he will bring a desire and energy to training. Which is not to say Evans would have sulked but it is hard to mask frustration for nigh on two months.

      "body": "<p>If it is surprising that none of Donna Tartt\u2019s three novels has made it to the screen before now, it\u2019s perhaps more surprising that <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2019/may/30/the-goldfinch-watch-the-emotional-trailer-for-the-film-based-on-donna-tartts-novel-video\" title=\"\">The Goldfinch</a></em> will be the first. Warner Brothers bought the rights to her first, bestselling, novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/18/donna-tartt-secret-history-modern-classic\" title=\"\">The Secret History</a></em>, in 1992, the year of its publication. With its cast of beautiful young obsessives drawn to murderous violence it begged to be filmed. Yet it never happened; Alan Pakula, who was to have directed it, died in 1998. Later, Gwyneth Paltrow and her brother acquired the rights, but also failed to make the movie. (The rights have duly reverted to the novelist herself.)</p> <p>Now, however, Tartt\u2019s third novel, <em>The Goldfinch </em>(2013), has been made into a film. Directed by John Crowley, who was responsible for the adaptation of Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s dauntingly inward novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/05/brooklyn-review-saoirse-ronan-shines-in-nick-hornby-colm-toibin-drama\" title=\"\">Brooklyn</a></em>, it stars Oakes Fegley and Ansel Elgort as Tartt\u2019s protagonist and narrator, Theo Decker, at different stages of his life. (One big challenge to the film-maker is the eight-year jump halfway through the novel, which takes Theo from his early teens to his 20s.) Aged 13, the only child of a single mother, Theo is cast adrift when she is killed in a bomb explosion at a New York art gallery. He survives, and in the chaos purloins a painting that his mother loved and with which he becomes obsessed. Nicole Kidman features as Mrs Barbour, the mother of his schoolfriend Andy, who initially appears to adopt Theo. Luke Wilson plays his feckless, self-deluding father, who reappears to take him off to a strange new life in Las Vegas.</p> <p>While <em>The Goldfinch</em> was a bestseller and won the Pulitzer prize for fiction, it divided critics. One challenge to film-makers is its length (864 pages in the current paperback edition; well over 300,000 words). It was called \u201cDickensian\u201d by some admiring reviewers, but the largest Dickens novels rely on highly elaborate plotting and a large cast of characters. <em>The Goldfinch </em>offers neither of these.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Tartt\u2019s invents a narrator who is as obsessed with detail as she is. Never has there been a teenage boy with such an eye for furnishings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reason it is so long is that, like Tartt\u2019s two previous novels, it is thick with circumstantial detail. Tartt cannot narrate even the least significant episode without fully visualising it. Tartt\u2019s novelistic modus operandi is, indeed, cinematic. Often the density of detail is such that the sentences become verbless lists. Tartt\u2019s narrator catalogues the world\u2019s visual clutter as greedily as any unblinking movie camera. The descriptions of the Barbours\u2019 huge Park Avenue apartment, with all its dark wood and chinoiserie, or the new-build Las Vegas house at the edge of the desert, where Theo has to live with his father, are like instruction sheets for set builders. When Theo is taken to a violent criminal\u2019s New York lair, you might expect him to be nervous, but he is too busy noticing the pictures on the wall and the books (Nabokov\u2019s <em>Despair</em>, Heidegger\u2019s<em> Being and Time</em>) on the table.</p> <p>Tartt\u2019s invents a narrator who is as obsessed with detail as she is (never has there been a teenage boy with such an eye for furnishings). Theo becomes attached to Hobie, a furniture restorer, and learns his methods, which are duly taught to the reader. He becomes a lover of antique artifacts. And it is not just things. We spend some 150 pages in Las Vegas, where at his new high school Theo befriends Boris, the pithily cynical son of a very dodgy Ukrainian mining speculator, with whom he is soon taking implausibly huge amounts of drugs. The high-school subcultures are precisely specified. Every good and bad drug trip is described with excruciating exactitude.</p> <p>Boris is the novel\u2019s most vivid character. Tartt fashions an idiolect for him that is a gift to any writer of a screenplay. She has a gift for rendering the unspoken scorn of the teenager for adult self-delusions, audible in the voice of Theo\u2019s rich yet put-upon friend Andy. One of the best things in the book is the group portrait of Andy\u2019s family, the absurdly privileged Barbours, in their grand apartment on Park Avenue. The covertly manic Mr Barbour, a little too enthusiastic about anything nautical. The perfect-seeming Mrs Barbour, dedicated to decorous charity and unperturbing high culture. Their eldest son, the hilariously seedy and baleful Platt, home from his super-exclusive boarding school because of some always unspecified sin. Tartt loves her East Coast \u00e9lite types, here offering character actors some deliciously, maliciously observed variants. The Barbours\u2019 mannered, sardonic repartee is one of the pleasures of the book that should successfully transfer to film.</p> <p>Many of these characters take on the author\u2019s specifying habits. When the brutish Platt tells Theo about his father\u2019s tragic sailing accident, it is with a psychologically unlikely but narratively gripping precision. The gift for minutiae controls the novel\u2019s setpiece scenes, whose re-creation any director should relish. Each of Tartt\u2019s novels turns on an episode of shocking violence. Here we begin with the bomb explosion and its immediate aftermath, described with full, second-by-second immersion in the dizzying detail. Near the end of the novel, there is an entirely unexpected and chaotic shoot-out. This must, in fact, take only seconds, but is narrated in a characteristic Tartt slow motion that appears already cinematic. As Theo recounts sudden movements he talks of events \u201clike a skip in a DVD throwing me forward in time\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d4207dce97f438c94553069d4d9ff9cf0ec25cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d4207dce97f438c94553069d4d9ff9cf0ec25cf/544_252_3438_2063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius on display in the Mauritshuis in The Hague, Netherlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius on display in the Mauritshuis in The Hague, Netherlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michel Porro/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hard part will be the obsession that drives the plot. Theo steals <em>The Goldfinch</em>. It is a real painting: a small masterpiece of the Dutch golden age by Carel Fabritius, a brilliant pupil of Rembrandt. It hangs in the <a href=\"https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/the-collection/artworks/the-goldfinch-605/\" title=\"\">Mauritshuis</a> gallery in The Hague. Fabritius died young, killed when the gunpowder magazine in the town of Delft exploded, destroying his studio (and many of his paintings). He left a tantalisingly small oeuvre, including this small, gorgeous painting of a bird, which, on close observation, is tethered by a small chain to its perch. In the novel, it is possible for the author to make us share the narrator\u2019s passion for the modest work of art. The film will have to show the picture to us and make us understand its magnetism.</p> <p>The story of Fabritius\u2019s death must have been the germ for Tartt\u2019s novel. When Theo thinks of the artist he dwells on \u201cthe element of chance: random disasters, mine and his, converging on the same unseen point\u201d. Such chance leads him to fall for a red-headed girl whom he spots in the art gallery just before the explosion and then continues to encounter over the years that follow. She is his other obsession \u2013 but has almost nothing to say or do in the book. Here is the weakest aspect of the novel and the biggest test for the film-makers. They will surely want to fill out her character and Theo\u2019s devotion to her; will they be able to resist the sentimentality that Tartt resolutely avoids? I would bet not.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 September 2019 to correct some instances of misspellings of the characters of the Barbour family as Balfour.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Goldfinch is released on 27 September.</em></p>",

Madrid had been under pressure to found a women\u2019s team for some time and, while there were doubts about the best way to do so, Tac\u00f3n\u2019s promotion to the first division was an opportunity to finalise an agreement that they had been working on for some time.</p> <p>Tac\u00f3n\u2019s name comes from the words <em>trabajo</em> (work), <em>atrevimiento</em> (daring/bravery), <em>conocimiento</em> (knowledge), <em>organizaci\u00f3n</em> (organisation) and <em>notoriedad</em> (notoriety) and spells out high heel \u2013 the logo of the club until Real Madrid\u2019s replaces it. The club\u2019s president, Ana Rosell, is a former player at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid but was both a <em>socio</em> (member) and a <em>compromisario</em> at Real Madrid \u2013 one of those chosen members with a voice and vote at the club\u2019s assemblies. The vice-president is Sergio Ramos\u2019s brother, Ren\u00e9.</p> <p>Tac\u00f3n initially began with girls\u2019 youth teams in 2014 but merged with Canillas, a team from the north-east of the city, in 2016. That allowed for a senior team. Rossell had first proposed collaboration with Real Madrid three years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e24ae62bcd31c3889e53c5ebe1c547c1e8c6a078\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e24ae62bcd31c3889e53c5ebe1c547c1e8c6a078/0_0_7086_4725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Real Madrid player Roberto Carlos (bottom row, right) and current Real Madrid players and staff watch Tac\u00f3n\u2019s friendly against Sevilla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Real Madrid player Roberto Carlos (bottom row, right) and current Real Madrid players and staff watch Tac\u00f3n\u2019s friendly against Sevilla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cordon Press/Cordon Press/Alamy Live News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Madrid were also in discussions with Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol Femenina, founded by Alfredo Ulloa, who said he had set the club up because his daughter could not play at Madrid where there were no girls\u2019 teams. Ulloa said he was not sure about \u201cselling\u201d the club to Real Madrid; he would have preferred to collaborate with them.</p> <p>Rosell will continue to run Tac\u00f3n/Real Madrid following the \u20ac400,000 deal and the new team is expected to have a budget of around \u20ac2m \u2013 more than any side in Spain other than FC Barcelona. This summer they signed the US-English striker Chioma Ubogagu, Swedish internationals Kosovare Asllani and Sofia Jakobsson, and the Brazilian international Thaisa.</p> <p>Twenty-one per cent of Real Madrid\u2019s <em>socios</em> are women and demands for them to have a women\u2019s team go back five years. Barcelona\u2019s women\u2019s team was founded in 1998, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s in 2001 and Athletic Club Bilbao\u2019s in 2002. The club was unsure of the best way to found the side: president Florentino P\u00e9rez had said he favoured building a team from scratch, starting at youth level, yet he had also said on other occasions that there was little point in having a women\u2019s team unless it was built to \u201cwin\u201d. That idea has prevailed with the move to bring Tac\u00f3n on board following their promotion and the subsequent signings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2dcda13bb1a5674713d457a9e086642e39e57331\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dcda13bb1a5674713d457a9e086642e39e57331/0_0_7086_4725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kosovare Asllani, one of Tac\u00f3n\u2019s summer signings, in action.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kosovare Asllani, one of Tac\u00f3n\u2019s summer signings, in action.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cordon Press/Alamy Live News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If there could be some unease at the appropriation of a women\u2019s team, it is a process that has been followed before \u2013 Atl\u00e9tico and Barcelona built their own sides, but Betis, Sevilla, Deportivo and Valencia all merged with existing clubs \u2013 and these moves were widely welcomed as raising the profile of the women\u2019s game, which has grown enormously in recent years.</p> <p>On the day the deal was announced, the sports daily Marca led on a photoshopped image depicting Real Madrid women\u2019s players celebrating a goal in the club\u2019s kit. \u201cWomen\u2019s football goes into another dimension,\u201d the headline said.</p> <p>Some criticised that headline. After all, it had already come a long way and there had been other breakthroughs. Spain\u2019s women had only narrowly been knocked out by the world champions USA in the World Cup, which was a big TV success this summer; Barcelona, who had the England striker Toni Duggan among their ranks, had reached the Champions League final; and a match between Atl\u00e9tico and Barcelona had attracted 60,738 to the Wanda Metropolitano. And yet few doubted that it was true: this was a significant step.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b1bd13e66937c51acf2f6341030483b4a2748d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b1bd13e66937c51acf2f6341030483b4a2748d1/0_0_4915_2164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barcelona\u2019s players celebrate a goal during last season\u2019s match against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"440\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barcelona\u2019s players celebrate a goal during last season\u2019s match against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kiko Huesca/EPA-EFE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMadrid is a monster that we were missing in women\u2019s football, so we are all celebrating this,\u201d said Rafa de Amo, the president of the women\u2019s football committee at the Federation. </p> <p>\u201cWe all wanted this: it will be nice to see the battles between Barcelona, Atl\u00e9tico and Real Madrid.

The vice-president is Sergio Ramos\u2019s brother, Ren\u00e9. Tac\u00f3n initially began with girls\u2019 youth teams in 2014 but merged with Canillas, a team from the north-east of the city, in 2016. That allowed for a senior team. Rossell had first proposed collaboration with Real Madrid three years ago. Madrid were also in discussions with Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol Femenina, founded by Alfredo Ulloa, who said he had set the club up because his daughter could not play at Madrid where there were no girls\u2019 teams. Ulloa said he was not sure about \u201cselling\u201d the club to Real Madrid; he would have preferred to collaborate with them. Rosell will continue to run Tac\u00f3n/Real Madrid following the \u20ac400,000 deal and the new team is expected to have a budget of around \u20ac2m \u2013 more than any side in Spain other than FC Barcelona. This summer they signed the US-English striker Chioma Ubogagu, Swedish internationals Kosovare Asllani and Sofia Jakobsson, and the Brazilian international Thaisa. Twenty-one per cent of Real Madrid\u2019s socios are women and demands for them to have a women\u2019s team go back five years. Barcelona\u2019s women\u2019s team was founded in 1998, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s in 2001 and Athletic Club Bilbao\u2019s in 2002. The club was unsure of the best way to found the side: president Florentino P\u00e9rez had said he favoured building a team from scratch, starting at youth level, yet he had also said on other occasions that there was little point in having a women\u2019s team unless it was built to \u201cwin\u201d. That idea has prevailed with the move to bring Tac\u00f3n on board following their promotion and the subsequent signings. If there could be some unease at the appropriation of a women\u2019s team, it is a process that has been followed before \u2013 Atl\u00e9tico and Barcelona built their own sides, but Betis, Sevilla, Deportivo and Valencia all merged with existing clubs \u2013 and these moves were widely welcomed as raising the profile of the women\u2019s game, which has grown enormously in recent years. On the day the deal was announced, the sports daily Marca led on a photoshopped image depicting Real Madrid women\u2019s players celebrating a goal in the club\u2019s kit. \u201cWomen\u2019s football goes into another dimension,\u201d the headline said. Some criticised that headline. After all, it had already come a long way and there had been other breakthroughs. Spain\u2019s women had only narrowly been knocked out by the world champions USA in the World Cup, which was a big TV success this summer; Barcelona, who had the England striker Toni Duggan among their ranks, had reached the Champions League final; and a match between Atl\u00e9tico and Barcelona had attracted 60,738 to the Wanda Metropolitano. And yet few doubted that it was true: this was a significant step. \u201cMadrid is a monster that we were missing in women\u2019s football, so we are all celebrating this,\u201d said Rafa de Amo, the president of the women\u2019s football committee at the Federation. \u201cWe all wanted this: it will be nice to see the battles between Barcelona, Atl\u00e9tico and Real Madrid. It\u2019s a great club and they\u2019ll bet heavily on women\u2019s football,\u201d the Barcelona player Andrea Pereira said. Her teammate, the Spain international Mapi Le\u00f3n, insisted: \u201cIt is good for women\u2019s football to have Real Madrid there.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re a club with a lot of \u2018pull\u2019,\u201d the Atl\u00e9tico captain, Amanda Sampedro, joked. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have them but only if we can beat them; if not, don\u2019t come.\u201d",

In 1989, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/homeaffairs/page/0,11026,875944,00.html\" title=\"\">section 28</a> banned local authorities from \u201cpromoting homosexuality\u201d. Without any recognition or inclusion, and with teachers essentially banned from reprimanding those who used homophobic slurs, bullying flourished and scarred a generation of young people. Growing up as a gay boy in Kent was hard. Schools couldn\u2019t even acknowledge the existence of gay people, let alone talk about the challenges we faced \u2013 I felt totally isolated and afraid of being found out. All the while, the media wrote stories about lesbian, gay and bi people arguing that children would be \u201cturned\u201d gay if they were taught about same-sex relationships. I had few role models and was left feeling ashamed of who I was. During my entire school career I couldn\u2019t accept my sexuality, let alone be open about it.</p> <p>The struggle to repeal section 28 took years. It only left the statute books in 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Kent county council even voted to keep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/nov/17/uk.gayrights\" title=\"\">its own version</a> of section 28, and that was only quashed when the 2010 Equality Act came into force. The damaging impact of this legislation is still felt in school hallways and classrooms across Britain.

All schools need to have the resources and time to engage with parents and carers, and explain how they will teach these subjects in a way that benefits children from all backgrounds. To make this happen, we want people to write to their local authorities and be vocal in their support for inclusive education, so that every child can grow up and reach their full potential.</p> <p>We know that <a href=\"https://www.stonewall.org.uk/node/137316\" title=\"\">60% of the British public </a><a href=\"https://www.stonewall.org.uk/node/137316\" title=\"\">want primary school teachers to talk positively about different kinds of families</a>, including those who are LGBT, to their students.

      "bodyText": "Students across the country are heading back to school this week, and while this might not seem momentous, for Stonewall, this school year marks the beginning of the end of a decades-long campaign to get an inclusive education system in England. In September 2020, new regulations for teaching relationships and sex education (RSE) in English schools come into force. It will be a landmark moment \u2013 a whole generation will attend schools that not only accept LGBT people and same-sex relationships, but also celebrate and offer support on the issues that young LGBT people face. The guidance means that primary schools will teach about different families, which of course includes LGBT families. Contrary to what\u2019s been said by some online and in the media, this is just about showing kids that families can have two mums or two dads. Or to put another way: different families, same love. If you, like me, were at school in the 1980s and 90s you endured an education system that erased LGBT people and history. In 1989, section 28 banned local authorities from \u201cpromoting homosexuality\u201d. Without any recognition or inclusion, and with teachers essentially banned from reprimanding those who used homophobic slurs, bullying flourished and scarred a generation of young people. Growing up as a gay boy in Kent was hard. Schools couldn\u2019t even acknowledge the existence of gay people, let alone talk about the challenges we faced \u2013 I felt totally isolated and afraid of being found out. All the while, the media wrote stories about lesbian, gay and bi people arguing that children would be \u201cturned\u201d gay if they were taught about same-sex relationships. I had few role models and was left feeling ashamed of who I was. During my entire school career I couldn\u2019t accept my sexuality, let alone be open about it. The struggle to repeal section 28 took years. It only left the statute books in 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Kent county council even voted to keep its own version of section 28, and that was only quashed when the 2010 Equality Act came into force. The damaging impact of this legislation is still felt in school hallways and classrooms across Britain. Stonewall\u2019s 2017 research showed that 40% of LGBT students were never taught anything about LGBT issues. Teaching about LGBT families not only means children from these families see themselves reflected in what they learn, but also helps all young people understand that there\u2019s nothing wrong or unusual about being LGBT. However, if this is to be effective, the government (whoever that might be) has to invest in training to prepare teachers and schools. All schools need to have the resources and time to engage with parents and carers, and explain how they will teach these subjects in a way that benefits children from all backgrounds. To make this happen, we want people to write to their local authorities and be vocal in their support for inclusive education, so that every child can grow up and reach their full potential. We know that 60% of the British public want primary school teachers to talk positively about different kinds of families, including those who are LGBT, to their students. We work in many schools where young people are already embedding LGBT inclusion in their schools \u2013 because it\u2019s so important for them. They\u2019re setting up LGBT networks among peers and teachers, as well as putting on assemblies to celebrate LGBT History Month or Pride. Life for most children has changed beyond recognition, but they are eager for more progress, particularly when 45% of LGBT young people still face bullying at school because of who they are. We must support them. I would have given anything to have had LGBT-inclusive education that taught me it was OK to just be me. For so many young people, September 2020 can\u2019t come soon enough. Inclusive teaching is an affirmation that you exist, and your identity is valid. It\u2019s also not just about lesbian, gay, bi and trans people. It\u2019s crucial that people realise that there\u2019s no hierarchy in this teaching. It\u2019s about acceptance for people from all backgrounds \u2013 be that race, gender, sexual orientation, faith, class and/or disability.

Murray is a great player entering a horrendous situation.</p> <p><strong>OC</strong> The Raiders. OK, so in one building we have: Antonio Brown, Jon Gruden, Mike Mayock, Richie Incognito, Vontaze Burfict, Mark Davis and the looming specter of a move to Vegas. Woof! Not even Derek Carr\u2019s blandness can save this inevitable calamity.</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> The Miami Dolphins are desperately trying to tank, but what if starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, who has the tendency to play fantastic when nobody expects anything from him and incredibly badly when handed the keys, backfires and they win enough games to sink their draft position? </p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> Beware more bizarre antics from Antonio Brown, especially once the Raiders start racking up losses. Trash-talking teammates and coaches, running off to Botswana, worshipping the color blue. With AB expect abnormal to be the norm.</p> <h2>The NFL\u2019s partnership with Jay-Z is \u2026</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> \u2026 not going to make anyone forget how the league treated Colin Kaepernick.</p> <p><strong>GB</strong> \u2026 further proof that Jay-Z is not just a businessman, he\u2019s a business, man! Whatever his aims are, it\u2019s a staggering decision to align himself with NFL owners.</p> <p><strong>OC</strong> \u2026 a sham. Progress to profit, this was always going to be the way. Jay-Z sold out Colin Kaepernick and his fellow, peaceful protestors. The NFL got what it wanted: Kaepernick is out of the league, other players are now on notice, and they\u2019re able to make cash. It\u2019s disgusting.</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> \u2026 incredibly devious. It\u2019s a brilliant marketing move that papers over a lot of ugliness in the league and the more I think about it, the more depressed I get.</p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> \u2026 a strange branding move for Jay-Z that may help a few people but will never detract from the league\u2019s role in Colin Kaepernick\u2019s unemployment.</p> <h2>MVP</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. It\u2019s reasonable to expect some regression, but the conditions are all there for him to thrive again in Andy Reid\u2019s offense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/nfl/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;headline=2018%20season&amp;name=Patrick%20Mahomes&amp;team=Kansas%20City%20Chiefs&amp;position=Quarterback&amp;number=15&amp;touchdowns=50&amp;interceptions=12&amp;yards=5097&amp;rating=113.8\" data-alt=\"Mahomes\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/nfl/index.html?opinion-tint=false&headline=2018%20season&name=Patrick%20Mahomes&team=Kansas%20City%20Chiefs&position=Quarterback&number=15&touchdowns=50&interceptions=12&yards=5097&rating=113.8\">Mahomes</a> </figure>  <p><strong>GB</strong> Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. He\u2019ll become the first repeat winner of the league\u2019s highest individual honor since Peyton Manning in 2008 and 2009.</p> <p><strong>OC</strong> Aaron Rodgers, Packers. Either a new staff revitalizes the most talented player (second now?) at the most valuable position in sports, or he\u2019s become some kind of uncoachable individualist who cannot work within a team construct, regardless of its construct. I\u2019m betting on the former; he\u2019s going to wreck the league.</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. His biggest obstacles? Well, there\u2019s the looming presence of Drew Brees, particularly if the Chiefs end with a worse record than the Saints, and the general difficulty of remaining fully healthy year in and year out in the NFL. Still, I believe.</p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. As long as Mahomes is in the same stratosphere as last season\u2019s 50-touchdown extravaganza, this is his award to lose in 2019 and beyond.</p> <h2>Rookie of the year</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> Josh Allen, Jaguars. There are two Josh Allens to keep an eye on in the NFL this season, but only one of them is a rookie pass rusher who I\u2019m expecting to light things up on a Jacksonville defense that could bounce back strongly in 2019.</p> <p><strong>GB</strong> David Montgomery, Bears. The rookie running back from Iowa State will be thrust into head coach Matt Nagy\u2019s offense. He\u2019s a gifted pass-catching back and will be a necessary weapon for a quarterback as inconsistent as Trubisky.</p> <p><strong>OC</strong> Mecole Hardman, Chiefs. Hardman might be the springiest athlete in the league. He was drafted to replace Tyreek Hill. Now, he\u2019ll play alongside him. If Hardman has four \u201cWow\u201d highlights, he\u2019ll clinch the award.</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> Josh Jacobs, Raiders. No 1 overall pick Kyler Murray is probably the favorite to win this one, but there are always questions when it comes to a rookie quarterback. It\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see Jacobs put up some monster numbers with the Raiders while Murray takes his lumps. His new boss <a href=\"https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/07/29/josh-jacobs-jon-gruden-expects-me-to-win-rookie-of-the-year/\">seems to believe that will happen</a>.</p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> Kyler Murray, Cardinals. Murray\u2019s talent and Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s playbook should help the rookie compile an undeniable highlight reel, thus securing an award that almost always goes to an offensive player.</p> <h2>AFC East champion</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> The Patriots, because of course.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;number=.784&amp;title=New%20England%E2%80%99s%20win%20percentage%20against%20division%20opponents%20in%20the%20Brady-Belichick%20era\" data-alt=\"Patriots\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Sport&number=.784&title=New%20England%E2%80%99s%20win%20percentage%20against%20division%20opponents%20in%20the%20Brady-Belichick%20era\">Patriots</a> </figure>  <p><strong>GB</strong> The Patriots last finished a season with fewer than double-digit wins was in 2002. </p> <p><strong>OC</strong> The Patriots. Duh. Messrs Belichick, Brady, Scarnecchia and McDaniels are there. If those four are in or around the building, they win the AFC East. It\u2019s that simple.</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> With Brady on the decline, and Rob Gronkowski retired, expect New England to take a step backward yet still clinch the division with ease.</p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> The Patriots. The easiest division to call for a decade now. The Jets and Bills should improve but will be second-class citizens until Bill Belichick retires.</p> <h2>AFC North champion</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> The Browns. Ah, go on then, let\u2019s buy all the way into Cleveland hype. This is a fascinating division, though \u2013 I believe in John Harbaugh\u2019s ability to make the most of Lamar Jackson\u2019s skillset and Mark Ingram is an upgrade at running back, too. If the Steelers can stay competitive, as usual, it\u2019s going to be a close fight.</p> <p><strong>GB</strong> The Ravens. Second-year quarterback Lamar Jackson is ready for a star turn, and the Baltimore offense will wear down opposing defenses with exhausting drives while their defense will provide its trademark tenacity.</p> <p><strong>OC</strong> The Browns. If Cleveland wore different helmets, they would be co-favorites to win the Super Bowl alongside the defending champs.</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> The Browns. This is saying something, since the Browns haven\u2019t won a division title since 1989 and haven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2002. The Cavaliers won an NBA title and the Indians won the pennant back in 2016. It\u2019s the Browns\u2019 time. </p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> The Ravens. Cleveland are the sexy pick but Lamar Jackson\u2019s progression and an elite secondary will help Baltimore prevail in a tight division.</p> <h2>AFC South champion</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> The Jaguars. So many questions for all of these teams. Can DeShaun Watson survive without an offensive line in Houston? Will Marcus Mariota ever become the star he was billed to be? Is there any hope for the Colts without Luck? I\u2019m not convinced that Nick Foles is going to be brilliant in Jacksonville, but he will be better than Blake Bortles, and that might be enough to vault the Jags to the top of the pile.</p> <p><strong>GB</strong> The Colts. Even with Andrew Luck\u2019s shocking retirement, Indianapolis will start one of the league\u2019s more reliable backups in Jacoby Brissett while returning one of the game\u2019s best defensive players in Darius Leonard, a stacked offensive line and an extremely creative offensive mind in head coach Frank Reich. </p> <p><strong>OC</strong> The Titans. I don\u2019t feel good about it, but it feels like they\u2019ve leapfrogged the Colts and Texans in the last fortnight.</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> The Texans. With Luck out of the picture, Houston are going all-in, particularly with the trade for tackle Laremy Tunsil, although possibly sacrificing their long-term success in the process. Watch as the Texans win the division by default, potentially with a .500 record, lose in their first game of the playoffs and suffer buyer\u2019s remorse for the next few seasons.</p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> The Jaguars. Jacksonville retained most of their key defensive starters and should again be a top-five unit. Nick Foles is a major upgrade over Blake Bortles.</p> <h2>AFC West champion</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> The Chiefs. Did I mention how much I\u2019m looking forward to watching Mahomes again?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;number=565&amp;title=Points%20scored%20by%20the%20Chiefs%20last%20season%2C%20breaking%20the%20previous%20franchise%20record%20of%20484\" data-alt=\"Chiefs\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Sport&number=565&title=Points%20scored%20by%20the%20Chiefs%20last%20season%2C%20breaking%20the%20previous%20franchise%20record%20of%20484\">Chiefs</a> </figure>  <p><strong>GB</strong> The Chargers. A toothless Chiefs defense means Los Angeles will shock the NFL and win the division. The holdout of running back Melvin Gordon denies quarterback Philip Rivers of one of his better weapons, but backup Austin Ekeler is a versatile piece and complements a host of talented playmakers between receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams as well as tight end Hunter Henry. Defensive ends Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram, arguably the league\u2019s most underrated defender, will terrorize opposing quarterbacks.</p> <p><strong>OC</strong> The Chargers. They finished eighth in defensive DVOA last year and third in offensive DVOA. And they improved on both sides of the ball.</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> The Chiefs. Here\u2019s where my Most Valuable Player pick has essentially made my choice for me. If Mahomes ends up being the regular-season MVP for a second straight season, that would probably necessitate him leading the Chiefs to their second straight AFC West title. The Chargers are going to make things interesting though.</p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> The Chiefs. With Mahomes, Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, Kansas City have too much firepower. The Chargers are close but losing disruptive safety Derwin James really stings.</p> <h2>AFC wild card teams</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos</p> <p><strong>GB</strong> New York Jets, Kansas City Chiefs</p> <p><strong>OC</strong> Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> Pittsburgh Steelers, LA Chargers</p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> Indianapolis Colts, Cleveland Browns</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e75d83f1f3e4a7c0a727ceeaf8601fb80f75e46f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e75d83f1f3e4a7c0a727ceeaf8601fb80f75e46f/0_0_4578_3052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New England Patriots\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The AFC East is the Patriots\u2019 division to lose as long as the Brady-Belichick union remains intact.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirby Lee/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>NFC East champion</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> The Eagles. If Carson Wentz can stay healthy, Philadelphia are a Super Bowl contender. That\u2019s a big if. Wentz made changes to his diet and workout schedule this offseason but his offensive line has been missing its entire right side in preseason. I\u2019m still taking Philly, and have high hopes for rookie running back Miles Sanders, but so much rests on the quarterback\u2019s ability to stay on the field.</p> <p><strong>GB</strong> The Eagles. Philadelphia\u2019s offensive line has combined to start 378 games <em>as members of the Eagles</em>, an astonishing feat of consistency that should help protect oft-injured quarterback Carson Wentz. On defense, linebacker Zach Brown was one of the best under-the-radar signings of the offseason. </p> <p><strong>OC</strong> The Eagles. Pull up Philadelphia\u2019s roster and try to find a hole. They are pretty much two-deep with league average talent at every single position. </p> <p><strong>HF</strong> The Eagles. Bonus prediction: Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz will be the Comeback Player of the Year. </p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> The Cowboys. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/04/ezekiel-elliott-contract-dallas-cowboys\">Zeke back</a> and Kellen Moore calling plays, plus a fierce pair of inside linebackers, Dallas should hold off the feisty Eagles and claim the division.</p> <h2>NFC North champion</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> The Vikings. Are we really sure Mitch Trubisky is going to take that big step forward in Chicago? The Packers have made significant upgrades to their pass rush and still have Aaron Rodgers behind center. But I\u2019m taking Minnesota, who have an elite defense as well as brilliant offensive weapons in Dalvin Cook, Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs. Kirk Cousins has his limitations, but I trust him more than Trubisky.</p> <p><strong>GB</strong> The Vikings. Kirk Cousins disappointed during his first season in Minnesota, but another year with receivers Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs plus a reliable defense will help the Vikings outlast the Bears and Packers in one of the league\u2019s toughest divisions.</p> <p><strong>OC</strong> The Packers. I\u2019ve picked Aaron Rodgers to win the MVP, so I\u2019ll give the division nod to Green Bay. I still think the Lions go deeper in the playoffs, though.</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> The Packers. It will be up for Aaron Rodgers to prove that he\u2019s not done but a change in head coach might be just what he needs. The Bears\u2019 ravenous defense should be enough to push them into the postseason, however.</p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> The Bears. Chicago\u2019s ridiculously stacked defense should give all NFL offenses nightmares. Also, Mitchell Trubisky is not the liability many think.</p> <h2>NFC South champion</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> The Falcons. I\u2019m worried about Cam Newton\u2019s shoulder. I also think that we may see a little regression from Drew Brees at 40 years old. Atlanta drafted to strengthen their offensive line but should be better in any case simply by virtue of having Keanu Neal, Ricardo Allen and Deion Jones \u2013 three key starters \u2013 back on defense after losing all three to injury early last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;number=74.4&amp;title=New%20Orleans%20quarterback%20Drew%20Brees\u2019s%20pass%20completion%20percentage%20last%20season%2C%20an%20NFL%20single-season%20record\" data-alt=\"Drew Brees\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=Sport&number=74.4&title=New%20Orleans%20quarterback%20Drew%20Brees\u2019s%20pass%20completion%20percentage%20last%20season%2C%20an%20NFL%20single-season%20record\">Drew Brees</a> </figure>  <p><strong>GB</strong> The Saints. For years, New Orleans soared on offense while fielding some of the league\u2019s worst defenses. The presence of defensive lineman Cameron Jordan and one of the game\u2019s best secondaries has transformed the Saints into a complete unit that is equipped to make a deep playoff run.</p> <p><strong>OC</strong> The Panthers. If Cam Newton\u2019s shoulder holds up, Carolina are as gifted as any team in the division.</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> New Orleans were defeated in overtime by the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC championship game after the referees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/22/saints-unfairly-deprived-super-bowl-place-missed-call-owner-gayle-benson-rule-changes\">missed an easy pass interference call</a> that would have put them in position to win in regulation. This will be their revenge season.</p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> The Saints. New Orleans went 13-3 last season and probably should have been in the Super Bowl. They only got better in the offseason. No reason they shouldn\u2019t dominate the division again.</p> <h2>NFC West champion</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> The Rams have their problems, and it\u2019s possible that opponents have learned a thing or two about how to stop them from watching Super Bowl LIII. But this division is still theirs to lose.</p> <p><strong>GB</strong> The Rams. Sean McVay enamored the world with his high-flying offense that anchored an unlikely Super Bowl berth. It\u2019s improbable that quarterback Jared Goff will be quite as good in 2019, but the Rams remain the class of the division.</p> <p><strong>OC</strong> The Rams. We\u2019re at the start of a long Sean McVay-Jared Goff run in the West. Don\u2019t overthink it. Eric Weddle might be the most impactful pickup anywhere this offseason.</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> The Rams. They still should be favorites to win the division but watch out for the Seattle Seahawks, who should challenge them throughout the rest of the season.</p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> The Rams.

Brady, with nothing left to prove to anyone, confirms that he will be back to do it all again next year anyway.</p> <p><strong>GB</strong> Saints over Ravens. In a thrilling clash of high-flying offense against punishing defense, Drew Brees finally overcomes the brutal playoff defeats that have ended the last two seasons in New Orleans before announcing his retirement. Lamar Jackson\u2019s valiant comeback ends short of the go-ahead touchdown, but Jackson\u2019s future brightens while one of the game\u2019s most prolific passers retires on top.</p> <p><strong>OC</strong> Eagles over Patriots. When you have a top-five offensive line and top-five pass-rush, you should be winning Super Bowls.</p> <p><strong>HF</strong> Saints over Chiefs. I want to say Kansas City here, but the fact is the Chiefs defense continues to lag well behind their offense. That\u2019s going to be a problem against Drew Brees and the Saints. In fact, if you\u2019re a betting person, take the over on the points allowed by Kansas City in this prediction.</p> <p><strong>MJ</strong> Bears over Patriots. With incredible defensive line depth that gives defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano many personnel options, the Bears are built to withstand the Pats\u2019 various run schemes. Khalil Mack, Eddie Jackson and company will be able to disrupt Tom Brady just like the Rams did last season, Chicago will showcase their dynamic run attack and a signal-caller in Trubisky who people forget was a stud in the second half of the doink-y loss to Philly.</p>",

With Sean McVay friend and disciples Zac Taylor, Mike LaFleur and Kliff Kingsbury stampeding the head-coaching ranks, not to mention Kyle Shanahan with a healthy arsenal, creative scheming should be the norm. Best team that won\u2019t make the playoffs NB The LA Chargers. Melvin Gordon is still holding out, Russell Okung\u2019s return date is uncertain as he recovers from a pulmonary embolism and Derwin James is on injured reserve. Or, to put it another way, Los Angeles are down their starting running back, best offensive tackle and an All-Pro safety. GB The Chicago Bears may have the league\u2019s best defense, but their league-leading 27 interceptions were a statistical outlier that is unlikely to repeat. Not even an elite defense will overcome the inconsistency of quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and the team\u2019s woeful kicking situation. OC The Indianapolis Colts. Indy have everything \u2026 except for Andrew Luck. Jacoby Brissett will do enough to carry a loaded team close to the playoffs, but they\u2019ll just fall short. HF The Baltimore Ravens. The AFC North is going to be brutal. The Cleveland Browns have a genuine shot at winning the division (don\u2019t laugh) and the Pittsburgh Steelers are always in the playoff mix. This could leave the Ravens on the outside looking in, although none of that will be the fault of starting quarterback Lamar Jackson, who should improve as a passer in his sophomore campaign. MJ The San Francisco 49ers. Regular season Jimmy Garoppolo will look much better than preseason Jimmy G. Close but not quite playoff material yet. Non-playoff team from last year that will make the playoffs NB The Browns. Obvious, perhaps, but I\u2019ll back Cleveland to end their 16-year postseason drought. GB The Jets. There are legitimate concerns about a team with a new head coach (Adam Gase) and one that fired their general manager in May. Fortunately, New York have a budding star in second-year quarterback Sam Darnold. He will be a top-five QB by season\u2019s end with new weapons in running back Le\u2019Veon Bell and wide receiver Jamison Crowder. Add linebacker CJ Mosley to one of the league\u2019s top defenses and the Jets should nab one of the two AFC wild card spots. OC The Browns are the obvious answer. The talent on both sides of the ball, at all three levels, is ludicrous. One tidbit to monitor: Cleveland\u2019s line is below average, even in an era of stinky offensive line play. HF The Browns. After a standout season from Baker Mayfield, Cleveland made the decision to trade for wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr to boost their offense. MJ The Packers. Matt LaFleur should add enough spice to the playbook and the Aaron Rodgers-Davante Adams combo should be enough to return to the postseason. One bold prediction NB Baltimore\u2019s Lamar Jackson will lead the league in rushing touchdowns. GB The Dolphins won\u2019t be the league\u2019s worst team. The Cardinals, winners of three games in 2018, will regress in 2019 and win fewer games than rebuilding Miami. OC Ben Roethlisberger is benched. Look at the advanced analytics, and Big Ben was the league average in 2018. Any stat you want to go to, the Pittsburgh quarterback was between 15th and 18th in the league: accuracy, throwing under pressure, depth of target, on and on and on. He was fine, but not his usual self. The decline is already underway. The collapse will come sooner than most think. HF Given the myriad issues in the league (from non-guaranteed contracts to the long-term health impacts of the sport), it wouldn\u2019t be shocking if we hear rumbling about the first players\u2019 strike since 1987. MJ Tom Brady\u2019s physical tools will finally regress to the point of being a liability. The Pats will still be in the Super Bowl but Brady will have a difficult decision to make about his future. Johnny Manziel disaster waiting to happen department NB Helmet sagas, frostbitten feet, fish-head-in-the-fridge lawsuits \u2026 is Antonio Brown in Oakland a disaster waiting to happen or one that\u2019s already unfolding? GB Arizona\u2019s Kyler Murray is an extremely talented quarterback who would thrive with a few games of study under a seasoned NFL quarterback. Instead, he\u2019ll be the Week 1 starter under rookie head coach Kliff Kingsbury, who compiled a 35-40 record as a college head coach and whose defenses finished 105th or lower for five consecutive seasons before his dismissal. Murray is a great player entering a horrendous situation. OC The Raiders. OK, so in one building we have: Antonio Brown, Jon Gruden, Mike Mayock, Richie Incognito, Vontaze Burfict, Mark Davis and the looming specter of a move to Vegas. Woof! Not even Derek Carr\u2019s blandness can save this inevitable calamity. HF The Miami Dolphins are desperately trying to tank, but what if starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, who has the tendency to play fantastic when nobody expects anything from him and incredibly badly when handed the keys, backfires and they win enough games to sink their draft position? MJ Beware more bizarre antics from Antonio Brown, especially once the Raiders start racking up losses. Trash-talking teammates and coaches, running off to Botswana, worshipping the color blue. With AB expect abnormal to be the norm. The NFL\u2019s partnership with Jay-Z is \u2026 NB \u2026 not going to make anyone forget how the league treated Colin Kaepernick. GB \u2026 further proof that Jay-Z is not just a businessman, he\u2019s a business, man! Whatever his aims are, it\u2019s a staggering decision to align himself with NFL owners. OC \u2026 a sham. Progress to profit, this was always going to be the way. Jay-Z sold out Colin Kaepernick and his fellow, peaceful protestors. The NFL got what it wanted: Kaepernick is out of the league, other players are now on notice, and they\u2019re able to make cash. It\u2019s disgusting. HF \u2026 incredibly devious. It\u2019s a brilliant marketing move that papers over a lot of ugliness in the league and the more I think about it, the more depressed I get. MJ \u2026 a strange branding move for Jay-Z that may help a few people but will never detract from the league\u2019s role in Colin Kaepernick\u2019s unemployment. MVP NB Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. It\u2019s reasonable to expect some regression, but the conditions are all there for him to thrive again in Andy Reid\u2019s offense. GB Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. He\u2019ll become the first repeat winner of the league\u2019s highest individual honor since Peyton Manning in 2008 and 2009. OC Aaron Rodgers, Packers. Either a new staff revitalizes the most talented player (second now?) at the most valuable position in sports, or he\u2019s become some kind of uncoachable individualist who cannot work within a team construct, regardless of its construct. I\u2019m betting on the former; he\u2019s going to wreck the league. HF Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. His biggest obstacles? Well, there\u2019s the looming presence of Drew Brees, particularly if the Chiefs end with a worse record than the Saints, and the general difficulty of remaining fully healthy year in and year out in the NFL. Still, I believe. MJ Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. As long as Mahomes is in the same stratosphere as last season\u2019s 50-touchdown extravaganza, this is his award to lose in 2019 and beyond. Rookie of the year NB Josh Allen, Jaguars. There are two Josh Allens to keep an eye on in the NFL this season, but only one of them is a rookie pass rusher who I\u2019m expecting to light things up on a Jacksonville defense that could bounce back strongly in 2019. GB David Montgomery, Bears. The rookie running back from Iowa State will be thrust into head coach Matt Nagy\u2019s offense. He\u2019s a gifted pass-catching back and will be a necessary weapon for a quarterback as inconsistent as Trubisky. OC Mecole Hardman, Chiefs. Hardman might be the springiest athlete in the league. He was drafted to replace Tyreek Hill. Now, he\u2019ll play alongside him. If Hardman has four \u201cWow\u201d highlights, he\u2019ll clinch the award. HF Josh Jacobs, Raiders. No 1 overall pick Kyler Murray is probably the favorite to win this one, but there are always questions when it comes to a rookie quarterback. It\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see Jacobs put up some monster numbers with the Raiders while Murray takes his lumps. His new boss seems to believe that will happen. MJ Kyler Murray, Cardinals. Murray\u2019s talent and Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s playbook should help the rookie compile an undeniable highlight reel, thus securing an award that almost always goes to an offensive player. AFC East champion NB The Patriots, because of course. GB The Patriots last finished a season with fewer than double-digit wins was in 2002. OC The Patriots. Duh. Messrs Belichick, Brady, Scarnecchia and McDaniels are there. If those four are in or around the building, they win the AFC East. It\u2019s that simple. HF With Brady on the decline, and Rob Gronkowski retired, expect New England to take a step backward yet still clinch the division with ease. MJ The Patriots. The easiest division to call for a decade now. The Jets and Bills should improve but will be second-class citizens until Bill Belichick retires. AFC North champion NB The Browns. Ah, go on then, let\u2019s buy all the way into Cleveland hype. This is a fascinating division, though \u2013 I believe in John Harbaugh\u2019s ability to make the most of Lamar Jackson\u2019s skillset and Mark Ingram is an upgrade at running back, too. If the Steelers can stay competitive, as usual, it\u2019s going to be a close fight. GB The Ravens. Second-year quarterback Lamar Jackson is ready for a star turn, and the Baltimore offense will wear down opposing defenses with exhausting drives while their defense will provide its trademark tenacity. OC The Browns. If Cleveland wore different helmets, they would be co-favorites to win the Super Bowl alongside the defending champs. HF The Browns. This is saying something, since the Browns haven\u2019t won a division title since 1989 and haven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2002. The Cavaliers won an NBA title and the Indians won the pennant back in 2016. It\u2019s the Browns\u2019 time. MJ The Ravens. Cleveland are the sexy pick but Lamar Jackson\u2019s progression and an elite secondary will help Baltimore prevail in a tight division. AFC South champion NB The Jaguars. So many questions for all of these teams. Can DeShaun Watson survive without an offensive line in Houston? Will Marcus Mariota ever become the star he was billed to be? Is there any hope for the Colts without Luck? I\u2019m not convinced that Nick Foles is going to be brilliant in Jacksonville, but he will be better than Blake Bortles, and that might be enough to vault the Jags to the top of the pile. GB The Colts. Even with Andrew Luck\u2019s shocking retirement, Indianapolis will start one of the league\u2019s more reliable backups in Jacoby Brissett while returning one of the game\u2019s best defensive players in Darius Leonard, a stacked offensive line and an extremely creative offensive mind in head coach Frank Reich. OC The Titans. I don\u2019t feel good about it, but it feels like they\u2019ve leapfrogged the Colts and Texans in the last fortnight. HF The Texans. With Luck out of the picture, Houston are going all-in, particularly with the trade for tackle Laremy Tunsil, although possibly sacrificing their long-term success in the process. Watch as the Texans win the division by default, potentially with a .500 record, lose in their first game of the playoffs and suffer buyer\u2019s remorse for the next few seasons. MJ The Jaguars. Jacksonville retained most of their key defensive starters and should again be a top-five unit. Nick Foles is a major upgrade over Blake Bortles. AFC West champion NB The Chiefs. Did I mention how much I\u2019m looking forward to watching Mahomes again? GB The Chargers. A toothless Chiefs defense means Los Angeles will shock the NFL and win the division. The holdout of running back Melvin Gordon denies quarterback Philip Rivers of one of his better weapons, but backup Austin Ekeler is a versatile piece and complements a host of talented playmakers between receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams as well as tight end Hunter Henry. Defensive ends Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram, arguably the league\u2019s most underrated defender, will terrorize opposing quarterbacks. OC The Chargers. They finished eighth in defensive DVOA last year and third in offensive DVOA. And they improved on both sides of the ball. HF The Chiefs. Here\u2019s where my Most Valuable Player pick has essentially made my choice for me. If Mahomes ends up being the regular-season MVP for a second straight season, that would probably necessitate him leading the Chiefs to their second straight AFC West title. The Chargers are going to make things interesting though. MJ The Chiefs. With Mahomes, Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, Kansas City have too much firepower. The Chargers are close but losing disruptive safety Derwin James really stings. AFC wild card teams NB Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos GB New York Jets, Kansas City Chiefs OC Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens HF Pittsburgh Steelers, LA Chargers MJ Indianapolis Colts, Cleveland Browns NFC East champion NB The Eagles. If Carson Wentz can stay healthy, Philadelphia are a Super Bowl contender. That\u2019s a big if. Wentz made changes to his diet and workout schedule this offseason but his offensive line has been missing its entire right side in preseason. I\u2019m still taking Philly, and have high hopes for rookie running back Miles Sanders, but so much rests on the quarterback\u2019s ability to stay on the field. GB The Eagles. Philadelphia\u2019s offensive line has combined to start 378 games as members of the Eagles, an astonishing feat of consistency that should help protect oft-injured quarterback Carson Wentz. On defense, linebacker Zach Brown was one of the best under-the-radar signings of the offseason. OC The Eagles. Pull up Philadelphia\u2019s roster and try to find a hole. They are pretty much two-deep with league average talent at every single position. HF The Eagles. Bonus prediction: Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz will be the Comeback Player of the Year. MJ The Cowboys. With Zeke back and Kellen Moore calling plays, plus a fierce pair of inside linebackers, Dallas should hold off the feisty Eagles and claim the division. NFC North champion NB The Vikings. Are we really sure Mitch Trubisky is going to take that big step forward in Chicago? The Packers have made significant upgrades to their pass rush and still have Aaron Rodgers behind center. But I\u2019m taking Minnesota, who have an elite defense as well as brilliant offensive weapons in Dalvin Cook, Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs. Kirk Cousins has his limitations, but I trust him more than Trubisky. GB The Vikings. Kirk Cousins disappointed during his first season in Minnesota, but another year with receivers Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs plus a reliable defense will help the Vikings outlast the Bears and Packers in one of the league\u2019s toughest divisions. OC The Packers. I\u2019ve picked Aaron Rodgers to win the MVP, so I\u2019ll give the division nod to Green Bay. I still think the Lions go deeper in the playoffs, though. HF The Packers. It will be up for Aaron Rodgers to prove that he\u2019s not done but a change in head coach might be just what he needs. The Bears\u2019 ravenous defense should be enough to push them into the postseason, however. MJ The Bears. Chicago\u2019s ridiculously stacked defense should give all NFL offenses nightmares. Also, Mitchell Trubisky is not the liability many think. NFC South champion NB The Falcons. I\u2019m worried about Cam Newton\u2019s shoulder. I also think that we may see a little regression from Drew Brees at 40 years old. Atlanta drafted to strengthen their offensive line but should be better in any case simply by virtue of having Keanu Neal, Ricardo Allen and Deion Jones \u2013 three key starters \u2013 back on defense after losing all three to injury early last year. GB The Saints. For years, New Orleans soared on offense while fielding some of the league\u2019s worst defenses. The presence of defensive lineman Cameron Jordan and one of the game\u2019s best secondaries has transformed the Saints into a complete unit that is equipped to make a deep playoff run. OC The Panthers. If Cam Newton\u2019s shoulder holds up, Carolina are as gifted as any team in the division. HF New Orleans were defeated in overtime by the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC championship game after the referees missed an easy pass interference call that would have put them in position to win in regulation. This will be their revenge season. MJ The Saints. New Orleans went 13-3 last season and probably should have been in the Super Bowl. They only got better in the offseason. No reason they shouldn\u2019t dominate the division again. NFC West champion NB The Rams have their problems, and it\u2019s possible that opponents have learned a thing or two about how to stop them from watching Super Bowl LIII. But this division is still theirs to lose. GB The Rams. Sean McVay enamored the world with his high-flying offense that anchored an unlikely Super Bowl berth. It\u2019s improbable that quarterback Jared Goff will be quite as good in 2019, but the Rams remain the class of the division. OC The Rams. We\u2019re at the start of a long Sean McVay-Jared Goff run in the West. Don\u2019t overthink it. Eric Weddle might be the most impactful pickup anywhere this offseason. HF The Rams. They still should be favorites to win the division but watch out for the Seattle Seahawks, who should challenge them throughout the rest of the season. MJ The Rams. Forget the last Super Bowl. They still boast a super-team roster and a head coach who schemes in his sleep. NFC wild card teams NB Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers GB Atlanta Falcons, Seattle Seahawks OC Detroit Lions, New Orleans Saints HF Seattle Seahawks, Chicago Bears MJ Seattle Seahawks, Green Bay Packers AFC championship game prediction NB Patriots over Chiefs GB Ravens over Patriots OC Patriots over Browns HF Chiefs over Patriots MJ Patriots over Chiefs NFC championship game prediction NB Eagles over Rams GB Saints over Seahawks OC Eagles over Lions HF Saints over Rams MJ Bears over Saints Super Bowl LIV prediction NB Patriots over Eagles. Tom Brady continues to defy age and logic, exacting revenge on the Eagles team that defied him two years before. Brady, with nothing left to prove to anyone, confirms that he will be back to do it all again next year anyway. GB Saints over Ravens. In a thrilling clash of high-flying offense against punishing defense, Drew Brees finally overcomes the brutal playoff defeats that have ended the last two seasons in New Orleans before announcing his retirement. Lamar Jackson\u2019s valiant comeback ends short of the go-ahead touchdown, but Jackson\u2019s future brightens while one of the game\u2019s most prolific passers retires on top. OC Eagles over Patriots. When you have a top-five offensive line and top-five pass-rush, you should be winning Super Bowls. HF Saints over Chiefs. I want to say Kansas City here, but the fact is the Chiefs defense continues to lag well behind their offense. That\u2019s going to be a problem against Drew Brees and the Saints. In fact, if you\u2019re a betting person, take the over on the points allowed by Kansas City in this prediction. MJ Bears over Patriots. With incredible defensive line depth that gives defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano many personnel options, the Bears are built to withstand the Pats\u2019 various run schemes. Khalil Mack, Eddie Jackson and company will be able to disrupt Tom Brady just like the Rams did last season, Chicago will showcase their dynamic run attack and a signal-caller in Trubisky who people forget was a stud in the second half of the doink-y loss to Philly.",

To make enough money to fix it before his pursuers cut off his ears, he needs to catch fish. His temporary assistant, Hector, an adolescent who turns up in a sweater with a pirate logo and who has only ever fished the local lagoon, is failing to earn his respect. The South American beach where Bolivar keeps his boat is strewn with symbols of their coming voyage, among them an old man whose \u201csongs are sung to the bones of the dead\u201d. A storm is in the offing; Bolivar and Hector should be returning to port, not leaving it.</p> <p>If you have a feeling that the older man has underestimated more than one factor in this mix, that he is ignoring too many aspects of his own life, and that as a result both men are in danger from something yet to happen, you\u2019re right: but the scale of it, the extremity of it and the poetry of it are what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/29/black-snow-paul-lynch-ireland-emigration-review\" title=\"\">Paul Lynch</a> is going to show you. Since 2013, Lynch, who is most often compared to Cormac McCarthy, has caught a few fish of his own. His debut novel, <em>Red Sky in Morning</em>, was a finalist for the French Meilleur Livre \u00c9tranger prize and a nominee for the Premier Roman prize. <em>Grace</em>, his third, won the Kerry Group Irish novel of the year in 2018 and was shortlisted for the Walter Scott prize.</p> <p>At the outset, <em>Beyond the Sea</em> seems more like a film than a book: a black-and-white two-hander from the mid-1950s, perhaps, with a familiar existential set-up, in which two men, lost at sea in the Pacific, must learn to understand each other if they are to survive; neither of them is quite what he seems. Two hours out, with \u201ccaves of dying light in the sky\u201d, Bolivar and Hector bait their hooks. The fishing is good, but the storm is on them before they know it. The boat flounders. The engine expires, the GPS and radio follow it into silence. From now on, as their condition deteriorates and rescue seems less and less likely, Lynch will engage us by having the two men engage with one another on life, death, survival and what it means to be \u2013 or even to believe \u2013 in the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>As rescue seems less and less likely, Lynch will engage us by having the two men engage with one another</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Bolivar, exactly as you would expect, the world is \u201cwithout answer\u201d: you can\u2019t discuss things with it, only meet it hands on. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he repeats. By extension, you are what you are, and what you are is expressed as agency. By contrast, Hector seems pliable, anaemic; he\u2019s glued to, and then mourns the loss of, his cellphone. The self he is now \u2013 the part of him in the boat as opposed to the part he has left behind on the land \u2013 is not real. It\u2019s a temporary construct, he believes, assumed to deal with his immediate situation: \u201cNo matter what way I look at it, I am not here and I am not there. I am not nothing but I am not anything either.\u201d In a desperate attempt to site himself, he makes an effigy of the Virgin Mary out of floating odds and ends, and prays that things will be returned to the way they were; Bolivar, unimpressed, touches the idol\u2019s leg at night and tries to get an erection.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to tell whether their differences are temperamental, cultural or generational, because everything we see is such a highly compressed artefact of the way Lynch narrates. Time, subjective and objective, particularly interests him. It moves so slowly for the men in the boat, he assures us. But when we turn the page it\u2019s Christmas and they are still alive, still drifting slowly westwards through the foul floating rubbish dump of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/22/great-pacific-garbage-patch-sprawling-with-far-more-debris-than-thought\" title=\"\">Pacific gyre</a>, in a physical condition Lynch\u2019s lyrical, deceptively sympathetic prose softens for us but never evades, accompanied by omens of the final sickness, hallucinatory violence and terror of the journey: a \u201clightning flare so remote that it seems to belong to another age\u201d, \u201ca fleeting unintelligible feeling of some other world\u201d caught in the eyes of a shark.</p> <p>\u201cYou could not have predicted so many things would happen at once,\u201d muses Bolivar, of the speed and comprehensiveness of the disaster, the way reality can so suddenly cease to be what it was a minute ago and become something completely different. This could easily have been one of those novels about what it is to be a man, where men are defined as those whose comprehension of their own circumstances is limited by appetite, material need and a tendency not to talk much. Instead, it turns into something more lyrical but at the same time colder and more shocking, much more self-aware. Contemporary Irish fiction prizes delivery, daring and an implicit trust in the reader: Lynch demonstrates a control over his ideas that comes from a pure lyrical telling, a speech act that, if you let it, will take you anywhere. <em>Beyond the Sea</em> is frightening but beautiful.</p> <p>\u2022<em> M John Harrison\u2019s You Should Come With Me Now is published by Comma.

Grace, his third, won the Kerry Group Irish novel of the year in 2018 and was shortlisted for the Walter Scott prize. At the outset, Beyond the Sea seems more like a film than a book: a black-and-white two-hander from the mid-1950s, perhaps, with a familiar existential set-up, in which two men, lost at sea in the Pacific, must learn to understand each other if they are to survive; neither of them is quite what he seems. Two hours out, with \u201ccaves of dying light in the sky\u201d, Bolivar and Hector bait their hooks. The fishing is good, but the storm is on them before they know it. The boat flounders. The engine expires, the GPS and radio follow it into silence. From now on, as their condition deteriorates and rescue seems less and less likely, Lynch will engage us by having the two men engage with one another on life, death, survival and what it means to be \u2013 or even to believe \u2013 in the world. For Bolivar, exactly as you would expect, the world is \u201cwithout answer\u201d: you can\u2019t discuss things with it, only meet it hands on. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he repeats. By extension, you are what you are, and what you are is expressed as agency. By contrast, Hector seems pliable, anaemic; he\u2019s glued to, and then mourns the loss of, his cellphone. The self he is now \u2013 the part of him in the boat as opposed to the part he has left behind on the land \u2013 is not real. It\u2019s a temporary construct, he believes, assumed to deal with his immediate situation: \u201cNo matter what way I look at it, I am not here and I am not there. I am not nothing but I am not anything either.\u201d In a desperate attempt to site himself, he makes an effigy of the Virgin Mary out of floating odds and ends, and prays that things will be returned to the way they were; Bolivar, unimpressed, touches the idol\u2019s leg at night and tries to get an erection. It\u2019s hard to tell whether their differences are temperamental, cultural or generational, because everything we see is such a highly compressed artefact of the way Lynch narrates. Time, subjective and objective, particularly interests him. It moves so slowly for the men in the boat, he assures us. But when we turn the page it\u2019s Christmas and they are still alive, still drifting slowly westwards through the foul floating rubbish dump of the Pacific gyre, in a physical condition Lynch\u2019s lyrical, deceptively sympathetic prose softens for us but never evades, accompanied by omens of the final sickness, hallucinatory violence and terror of the journey: a \u201clightning flare so remote that it seems to belong to another age\u201d, \u201ca fleeting unintelligible feeling of some other world\u201d caught in the eyes of a shark. \u201cYou could not have predicted so many things would happen at once,\u201d muses Bolivar, of the speed and comprehensiveness of the disaster, the way reality can so suddenly cease to be what it was a minute ago and become something completely different. This could easily have been one of those novels about what it is to be a man, where men are defined as those whose comprehension of their own circumstances is limited by appetite, material need and a tendency not to talk much. Instead, it turns into something more lyrical but at the same time colder and more shocking, much more self-aware. Contemporary Irish fiction prizes delivery, daring and an implicit trust in the reader: Lynch demonstrates a control over his ideas that comes from a pure lyrical telling, a speech act that, if you let it, will take you anywhere.

(The March update, 1903, was actually released in May.)</p> <p>Thanks to WaaS, there are no more expensive \u201cbig bang\u201d updates, which used to cause large organisations enormous pain and left some of them clinging to obsolete versions of Windows for more than a decade. Smaller, more frequent updates are much easier to handle, especially using tools such as <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/get-started/windows-server-update-services-wsus\">WSUS</a> (Windows Server Update Services), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_System_Center_Configuration_Manager\">SCCM</a> (System Center Configuration Manager) and <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Blog-Archive/What-is-Windows-Update-for-Business/ba-p/167033\">WUfB</a> (Windows Update for Business). They are a bit of a pain for some home users, but Microsoft is trying to alleviate any problems.</p> <p>With WaaS, Microsoft also changed its support system. It now has a <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a> where basic versions of Windows 10 are only supported for 18 months. You have lost the 10 years of support, but your support now continues for ever, as long as you keep installing new versions of Windows 10. In reality, \u201cfor ever\u201d means for as long as your device can run them.</p> <p>The net result is that Microsoft is still supporting at least three versions of Windows, but the three will usually have been launched about six months apart, instead of three years apart.</p> <h2><strong>Where you are</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bfa27efad28d741ff94c9124800edfe5decb204\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bfa27efad28d741ff94c9124800edfe5decb204/589_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A laptop running Windows\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Microsoft\u2019s timeline system was introduced in the Windows 10 April 2018 update.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You are, I deduce, running Windows 10 version 1803: this was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/30/windows-10-april-2018-update-microsoft-task-management-cortana-edge-sharing\">released on 30 April 2018</a>, and reaches the end of its supported life on 12 November 2019. So Windows Update is telling you, correctly, that this version is up to date.</p> <p>However, you have failed to install either of the two latest milestone releases, 1809 and 1903. You therefore have an up-to-date version of an out-of-date version of Windows 10. Your current version does not need updating, it needs replacing. This is what you should do.</p> <p>You are in much the same position as someone who is still running an up-to-date version of Windows 7, having skipped later releases. The main differences are that the timescales are much shorter and the upgrades are now free.</p> <p>Microsoft would like everyone to be on the same version of Windows, and it would not be economic to support 10 or 20 different versions. It is therefore using the end of support \u2013 and the end of security fixes \u2013 to push users into updating their systems, even though the Windows 10 Enterprise version of 1803 will be supported for another year (until 10 November 2020).</p> <p>These PCs are less of a burden because large organisations use tools such as WSUS to update thousands of PCs, rather than each one downloading the code separately.

Instead, the task of updating more than 800m PCs is spread over many months.</p> <p>A few million people want the latest version, even if it isn\u2019t finished. They join the \u201c<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-insider/\">insider ring</a>\u201d of beta testers, who look for bugs before the operating system is released to a wider audience. Some are what Microsoft calls \u201cseekers\u201d: they check manually for updates and install them as soon as they become available. Most people just ignore new versions until they are reminded to install them, or \u2013 if they really are not paying attention \u2013 the installation is practically under way.</p> <p>In general, it\u2019s safer to install milestone updates later rather than sooner. If you upgrade to version 1903 now, you will get a version that has had months of testing, and that has already been installed on hundreds of millions of PCs. If you wait for the \u201cfall version\u201d, currently called 19H2, then you will get code that hasn\u2019t been as thoroughly debugged. Also, it will be a bigger leap from 1803, and big leaps are inherently riskier than small ones.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to be on the current version of Windows 10, where some new features may introduce a few new bugs.

      "body": "<p>The Indian ascetic tradition can add another name to its ranks: former Australian parliamentary secretary and ultra-marathon runner Pat Farmer, whose 4,600km \u201cSpirit of India\u201d run in 2016 from the subcontinent\u2019s southern tip to Kashmir is chronicled here. That\u2019s 80km \u2013 two marathons \u2013 a day, for 64 days. If that, often undertaken in 80% humidity, doesn\u2019t sound masochistic enough, Farmer\u2019s social schedule (the run is to promote girls\u2019 education) would finish any normal man off: he attends more than 750 \u201cevents\u201d, many on the hoof, during this time.</p> <p>India can\u2019t fail to provide colour en route, but director Anupam Sharma\u2019s nippy travelogue format is strictly passing through. Barely any Indians are interviewed about what Farmer\u2019s feat means to them, and the alternating asphalt-pounding and meet-and-greets eventually stretch the bounds of documentary patience. Farmer himself is so indomitable \u2013 even a bout of stomach flu barely causes him to break stride \u2013 that he isn\u2019t that compelling a subject.</p> <p>The closest The Run comes to an arresting subplot is with the team\u2019s greenhorn intern Kevin, fresh out of university, who finds himself under Farmer\u2019s cosh for failing to secure decent enough media coverage. At one point, he muses that the Aussie press would find the story more compelling if his boss died. Watching him shuffle his battered sinews across four lanes of Mumbai traffic, this seems a distinct possibility.</p> <p>An unfulfilled note hangs over the whole enterprise. A meeting with Modi doesn\u2019t come through. The postscript resentfully notes that Farmer has yet to be invited to participate in bilateral trade discussions. Kevin\u2019s insight lingers: you have to ask if Farmer found a sharp enough way to communicate the meaning of this journey. Not in this film, which doesn\u2019t go beyond platitudes about \u201cdreams\u201d and \u201cbringing the two countries closer together\u201d, or pry much into Farmer\u2019s seemingly bottomless obstinacy. The Spirit of India isn\u2019t even the most hardcore thing he\u2019s done \u2013 that would be <a href=\"https://www.patfarmer.com/pole-to-pole\">the Pole to Pole run in 2011</a>. Still, saying it merits A for effort feels like an understatement.</p> <p>\u2022 The Run is released in the UK on 6 September.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGhbm6uXewU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GGhbm6uXewU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "The Indian ascetic tradition can add another name to its ranks: former Australian parliamentary secretary and ultra-marathon runner Pat Farmer, whose 4,600km \u201cSpirit of India\u201d run in 2016 from the subcontinent\u2019s southern tip to Kashmir is chronicled here. That\u2019s 80km \u2013 two marathons \u2013 a day, for 64 days. If that, often undertaken in 80% humidity, doesn\u2019t sound masochistic enough, Farmer\u2019s social schedule (the run is to promote girls\u2019 education) would finish any normal man off: he attends more than 750 \u201cevents\u201d, many on the hoof, during this time. India can\u2019t fail to provide colour en route, but director Anupam Sharma\u2019s nippy travelogue format is strictly passing through. Barely any Indians are interviewed about what Farmer\u2019s feat means to them, and the alternating asphalt-pounding and meet-and-greets eventually stretch the bounds of documentary patience. Farmer himself is so indomitable \u2013 even a bout of stomach flu barely causes him to break stride \u2013 that he isn\u2019t that compelling a subject. The closest The Run comes to an arresting subplot is with the team\u2019s greenhorn intern Kevin, fresh out of university, who finds himself under Farmer\u2019s cosh for failing to secure decent enough media coverage. At one point, he muses that the Aussie press would find the story more compelling if his boss died. Watching him shuffle his battered sinews across four lanes of Mumbai traffic, this seems a distinct possibility. An unfulfilled note hangs over the whole enterprise. A meeting with Modi doesn\u2019t come through. The postscript resentfully notes that Farmer has yet to be invited to participate in bilateral trade discussions. Kevin\u2019s insight lingers: you have to ask if Farmer found a sharp enough way to communicate the meaning of this journey. Not in this film, which doesn\u2019t go beyond platitudes about \u201cdreams\u201d and \u201cbringing the two countries closer together\u201d, or pry much into Farmer\u2019s seemingly bottomless obstinacy. The Spirit of India isn\u2019t even the most hardcore thing he\u2019s done \u2013 that would be the Pole to Pole run in 2011. Still, saying it merits A for effort feels like an understatement. \u2022 The Run is released in the UK on 6 September.",

After Bolton avoided extinction they will mark the occasion by signing striker Joe Dodoo, who was recently released by Rangers.",

      "body": "<p>In November 1959 aged 26, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/29/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Susan Sontag</a> announced her rebirth as a writer and as a sexual being. She\u2019d been married for seven years to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/dec/05/highereducation.uk1\" title=\"\">Philip Rieff</a> and slept with 36 men and women. But it was only now, in bed with Cuban-American playwright Mar\u00eda Irene Forn\u00e9s, that she\u2019d had her first orgasm. It \u201chas changed my life\u201d, she declared proudly in her journal. \u201cThe orgasm focuses. I lust to write. The coming of the orgasm is not the salvation but, more, the birth of the ego \u2026 The only kind of writer [I] could be is the kind who exposes himself \u2026 To write is to spend oneself, to gamble oneself. But up to now I have not even liked the sound of my own name.\u201d</p> <p>The passage raises questions about Sontag\u2019s relationship with her body (what had gone wrong previously? What had changed?) but more importantly about her relationship with writing. She had known as a small child that she wanted to write. Aged six, she\u2019d planned to win the Nobel prize for literature. But until now, she had produced only college essays and the book \u2013 <em>Freud: The Mind of the Moralist</em> \u2013 that she had written for her husband, based on his research. It lacked the stridency, the aphoristic wit for which her writing would soon be known. So what convinced her that she had to be a writer \u201cwho exposes himself\u201d \u2013 and why that unnecessarily masculine \u201chimself\u201d? Her new model seemed to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/nov/13/farewelltonormanmailerase\" title=\"\">Norman Mailer</a>, whose 1957 essay \u201cThe White Negro\u201d had shocked the establishment with its proclamations about orgasms as the basis for creative identity, just as Sontag was dismissing her own voice as \u201cpuny, cautious, too sane\u201d.</p> <p>Sontag\u2019s relationship with Mailer is itself fascinating (and was immortalised in the documentary <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/31/the-town-hall-affair-wooster-group-norman-mailer-germaine-greer\" title=\"\">Town Bloody Hall,</a> </em>filmed in 1971, where Sontag chastised him for referring to \u201clady writers\u201d). But what her Mailer impersonation heralds here is a moment of wilful self-invention of the kind she performed throughout her life with extraordinary success. She often goaded herself to transform at the same time as castigating herself for her fakeness in doing so.</p> <p>Her capacity for self-invention is, rightly, a central theme in Benjamin Moser\u2019s authorised biography. In 1971 Sontag described herself as \u201conly interested in people engaged in a project of self-transformation\u201d, a phrase that fascinates Moser, who sees Sontag\u2019s life as a project first to open the gap between the woman writing and \u201cSusan Sontag\u201d, her famous, charismatic alter ego, and then to close it.</p> <p>The self-transformations began in childhood when, aged 11, the shy, sickly Sue Rosenblatt changed her name to Susan Sontag (after her mother\u2019s remarriage) and vowed \u201cI will be popular\u201d, altering her behaviour to fit in with her new schoolmates in Tuscon, Arizona. Aged 16, attending Berkeley for a year, she had her first lesbian affair and considered herself \u201creborn\u201d: \u201cto love one\u2019s body and use it well, that\u2019s primary \u2026 I can do that, I know, for I am freed now\u201d. But shortly afterwards a male friend advised her to master heterosexual sex, in order to flourish amid homophobia. Hence the 36 lovers: she was always methodical, after all. Then there was marriage and motherhood, where Sontag developed the persona of the diligent helpmate and academic in training. And then came her escape to Oxford and to Paris, and the affair with Forn\u00e9s, at just the moment when she\u2019d started to find marriage unbearable (\u201cIt is an institution committed to the dulling of the feelings,\u201d she complained) and to feel the urgency of a more radical writerly quest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We have Sontag as daughter, friend, lover, wife and mother, but Moser\u2019s writing is appropriately bold and anecdotal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI feel a vocation flowering within me,\u201d she wrote to her husband<strong> </strong>after discovering orgasms with Forn\u00e9s. \u201cI want to be free. I\u2019m prepared to pay the price \u2013 in terms of my own unhappiness \u2013 for being free.\u201d So at the end of 1959, Sontag invented herself as a free woman. What a complicated, exhilarating set of drives were at play, all of which contributed to what followed: the reinvention of the impersonal essay as a dazzling firework display and vehicle for fame.</p> <p>By the time that Sontag\u2019s first essay collection was published in 1966 she was already famous, hailed in the New York Times as \u201ceasily the most controversial critic writing in America today\u201d. There had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/16/against-interpretation-susan-sontag-100-best-nonfiction-books\" title=\"\">\u201cAgainst Interpretation\u201d</a>, with its call for \u201can erotics of art\u201d in place of interpretation; there had been essays redefining what the novel could be and how psychoanalysis should be understood. There had been her brilliant, career-defining \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/08/camp-goes-pop-why-susan-sontag-fans-are-having-a-ball\" title=\"\">Notes on \u2018Camp\u2019\u201d</a>, which delineated the characteristics of camp and made a case for \u201chomosexual aestheticism and irony\u201d as one of the two pioneering forces of modern sensibility, alongside \u201cJewish moral seriousness\u201d. The success of this self-transformation left her friends amazed. How could a critic be this famous? What had made Andy Warhol recognise a kindred spirit and decide in 1964 to immortalise her as the laconic star of his <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jan/24/andy-warhol-screen-tests-susan-sontag-lou-reed-salvador-dali\" title=\"\">Screen Tests</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jan/24/andy-warhol-screen-tests-susan-sontag-lou-reed-salvador-dali\" title=\"\">,</a> slouching elegantly in sunglasses? Here was all she had hoped for in that post-orgasmic diary entry, where she went on to say that her desire to write was \u201cconnected with my homosexuality. I need the identity as a weapon, to match the weapon that society has against me\u201d. Without coming out as a lesbian, she\u2019d succeeded in making homosexuality cool and in making herself famous at the same time.</p> <p>A life with so much posturing, so many surfaces layered obfuscatingly on top of each other, is hard to describe, but Moser does rather a brilliant job. Over the course of 700 pages, we have Sontag as daughter, friend, lover, wife and mother, but Moser\u2019s writing is appropriately bold and anecdotal, so there is less the feeling of years accrued than of selves tried out. He\u2019s an essayist, taking on an essayist, and his best passages are biographical readings of her writing. His assessment of her novels is punchy and insightful. Of her wilfully unreadable <em>The Benefactor</em> he writes: \u201cSontag\u2019s determination to create an unreliable narrator is so reliable that it becomes tedious: there is, after all, nothing here we relied on to begin with.\u201d</p> <p>He makes good use of the archives, quoting from a revealing selection of unpublished diary entries, letters and essays, including a 1973 draft essay on Sartre that he describes as an act of \u201cautofiction\u201d. Here she criticises the French writer for his Faustian pact with the drug speed and for his politics (\u201cphilistinism \u2013 in the familiar guise of moralism\u201d), seeing him as selling his soul for the sake of constant fame in terms that certainly make more sense when read alongside her own life.

      "bodyText": "In November 1959 aged 26, Susan Sontag announced her rebirth as a writer and as a sexual being. She\u2019d been married for seven years to Philip Rieff and slept with 36 men and women. But it was only now, in bed with Cuban-American playwright Mar\u00eda Irene Forn\u00e9s, that she\u2019d had her first orgasm. It \u201chas changed my life\u201d, she declared proudly in her journal. \u201cThe orgasm focuses. I lust to write. The coming of the orgasm is not the salvation but, more, the birth of the ego \u2026 The only kind of writer [I] could be is the kind who exposes himself \u2026 To write is to spend oneself, to gamble oneself. But up to now I have not even liked the sound of my own name.\u201d The passage raises questions about Sontag\u2019s relationship with her body (what had gone wrong previously? What had changed?) but more importantly about her relationship with writing. She had known as a small child that she wanted to write. Aged six, she\u2019d planned to win the Nobel prize for literature. But until now, she had produced only college essays and the book \u2013 Freud: The Mind of the Moralist \u2013 that she had written for her husband, based on his research. It lacked the stridency, the aphoristic wit for which her writing would soon be known. So what convinced her that she had to be a writer \u201cwho exposes himself\u201d \u2013 and why that unnecessarily masculine \u201chimself\u201d? Her new model seemed to be Norman Mailer, whose 1957 essay \u201cThe White Negro\u201d had shocked the establishment with its proclamations about orgasms as the basis for creative identity, just as Sontag was dismissing her own voice as \u201cpuny, cautious, too sane\u201d. Sontag\u2019s relationship with Mailer is itself fascinating (and was immortalised in the documentary Town Bloody Hall, filmed in 1971, where Sontag chastised him for referring to \u201clady writers\u201d). But what her Mailer impersonation heralds here is a moment of wilful self-invention of the kind she performed throughout her life with extraordinary success. She often goaded herself to transform at the same time as castigating herself for her fakeness in doing so. Her capacity for self-invention is, rightly, a central theme in Benjamin Moser\u2019s authorised biography. In 1971 Sontag described herself as \u201conly interested in people engaged in a project of self-transformation\u201d, a phrase that fascinates Moser, who sees Sontag\u2019s life as a project first to open the gap between the woman writing and \u201cSusan Sontag\u201d, her famous, charismatic alter ego, and then to close it. The self-transformations began in childhood when, aged 11, the shy, sickly Sue Rosenblatt changed her name to Susan Sontag (after her mother\u2019s remarriage) and vowed \u201cI will be popular\u201d, altering her behaviour to fit in with her new schoolmates in Tuscon, Arizona. Aged 16, attending Berkeley for a year, she had her first lesbian affair and considered herself \u201creborn\u201d: \u201cto love one\u2019s body and use it well, that\u2019s primary \u2026 I can do that, I know, for I am freed now\u201d. But shortly afterwards a male friend advised her to master heterosexual sex, in order to flourish amid homophobia. Hence the 36 lovers: she was always methodical, after all. Then there was marriage and motherhood, where Sontag developed the persona of the diligent helpmate and academic in training. And then came her escape to Oxford and to Paris, and the affair with Forn\u00e9s, at just the moment when she\u2019d started to find marriage unbearable (\u201cIt is an institution committed to the dulling of the feelings,\u201d she complained) and to feel the urgency of a more radical writerly quest. \u201cI feel a vocation flowering within me,\u201d she wrote to her husband after discovering orgasms with Forn\u00e9s. \u201cI want to be free. I\u2019m prepared to pay the price \u2013 in terms of my own unhappiness \u2013 for being free.\u201d So at the end of 1959, Sontag invented herself as a free woman. What a complicated, exhilarating set of drives were at play, all of which contributed to what followed: the reinvention of the impersonal essay as a dazzling firework display and vehicle for fame. By the time that Sontag\u2019s first essay collection was published in 1966 she was already famous, hailed in the New York Times as \u201ceasily the most controversial critic writing in America today\u201d. There had been \u201cAgainst Interpretation\u201d, with its call for \u201can erotics of art\u201d in place of interpretation; there had been essays redefining what the novel could be and how psychoanalysis should be understood. There had been her brilliant, career-defining \u201cNotes on \u2018Camp\u2019\u201d, which delineated the characteristics of camp and made a case for \u201chomosexual aestheticism and irony\u201d as one of the two pioneering forces of modern sensibility, alongside \u201cJewish moral seriousness\u201d. The success of this self-transformation left her friends amazed. How could a critic be this famous? What had made Andy Warhol recognise a kindred spirit and decide in 1964 to immortalise her as the laconic star of his Screen Tests, slouching elegantly in sunglasses? Here was all she had hoped for in that post-orgasmic diary entry, where she went on to say that her desire to write was \u201cconnected with my homosexuality. I need the identity as a weapon, to match the weapon that society has against me\u201d. Without coming out as a lesbian, she\u2019d succeeded in making homosexuality cool and in making herself famous at the same time. A life with so much posturing, so many surfaces layered obfuscatingly on top of each other, is hard to describe, but Moser does rather a brilliant job. Over the course of 700 pages, we have Sontag as daughter, friend, lover, wife and mother, but Moser\u2019s writing is appropriately bold and anecdotal, so there is less the feeling of years accrued than of selves tried out. He\u2019s an essayist, taking on an essayist, and his best passages are biographical readings of her writing. His assessment of her novels is punchy and insightful. Of her wilfully unreadable The Benefactor he writes: \u201cSontag\u2019s determination to create an unreliable narrator is so reliable that it becomes tedious: there is, after all, nothing here we relied on to begin with.\u201d He makes good use of the archives, quoting from a revealing selection of unpublished diary entries, letters and essays, including a 1973 draft essay on Sartre that he describes as an act of \u201cautofiction\u201d. Here she criticises the French writer for his Faustian pact with the drug speed and for his politics (\u201cphilistinism \u2013 in the familiar guise of moralism\u201d), seeing him as selling his soul for the sake of constant fame in terms that certainly make more sense when read alongside her own life. Moser also parses her political views compellingly and opinionatedly, criticising her for being too gullible on North Vietnam, applauding her decision to stage Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo, and lamenting her failure either to come out as gay or to risk personal statements during the Aids crisis (her 1989 essay \u201cAIDS and Its Metaphors\u201d came across as staid and cowardly at a time when she might have usefully gone further towards the self-exposure she goaded herself to in 1959). I found Moser less interesting on psychology, and this again may be appropriate, given that Sontag\u2019s friends repeatedly criticised her for her lack of psychological insight. It\u2019s not that Moser isn\u2019t insightful \u2013 his judgments usually ring true \u2013 more that he doesn\u2019t have the kind of novelistic curiosity some biographers have. Sontag\u2019s son David, and her husband, lovers and friends, don\u2019t emerge as real people. Sontag herself does, to an extent, but Moser has a tendency to diagnose her disorders with the language of a psychology manual. \u201cShe remained,\u201d he tells us, \u201calmost to the point of caricature, the adult child of an alcoholic, with all of their weaknesses\u201d; her use of speed apparently worsened the \u201cpersonality disorders grouped together in Cluster B\u201d (fear of abandonment, inconsolable loneliness, antisocial behaviour such as rudeness and volatility).

      "bodyText": "Human trials of new antimalarial drugs are in the pipeline after Kenyan scientists successfully used a derivative from bacteria to kill a parasite that causes the disease. The Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) and global health partners say the breakthrough could potentially lead to the development of a new way of tackling malaria in less than two years. The promise of a new treatment comes after trials in Burkina Faso found that Ivermectin, a conventional drug used for parasitic diseases including river blindness and elephantiasis, reduced transmission rates. The medication worked by making the blood of people who were repeatedly treated lethal to mosquitoes. The study also found that Ivermectin can kill plasmodium falciparum, a malaria parasite, in mosquitos that had fed on humans who had been administered the drug. The US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now perform human trials using new drugs derived from the bacteria after extensive lab research. The initiative was prompted by studies conducted by the World Health Organization and several international health agencies warning of resistance to existing antimalarial drugs. \u201cResistance is always a problem and the parasite always finds a way to get away with it. That is why a new line of treatment is a must. It has to be made available soon,\u201d said Dr Simon Kariuki, head of Kenya\u2019s malaria research programmes at Kemri. The research is being conducted in Kenya by local scientists in collaboration with international health experts. \u201cWe have discovered [that the derivative of the] bacterium is highly effective in killing plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria, but our research is more focused on pregnant women and children as they are more vulnerable. We are getting very motivating leads,\u201d Kariuki said. \u201cIn a few years, new malaria drugs could be in the market if the current research findings are to go by. The same bacteria known to kill dangerous pathogens in scabies, river blindness, can also be applied in malaria. \u201cThe motivating success of Ivermectin is leading us to venture into producing other drugs. That is very encouraging and it means more research, and that is what we are doing.\u201d Child malaria episodes could be reduced by up to 20% if populations living in high-risk areas are given Ivermectin, according to a study published by the Yale School of Public Health. Kenya\u2019s health ministry says malaria cases have gone up from 16,000 in 2016 to about 18,757 last year, and experts warn that the climate crisis could make matters worse. \u201cFuture drug trials of women and children are planned \u2026 and obviously with the highest safety standards. We need more answers on Ivermectin. We need new malaria drugs as soon as possible as drug resistance is not something to ignore and we have to treat the situation as urgent,\u201d said Kariuki. An expert, independent from the study, said reports of resistance to the current class of malaria drugs are on the rise. \u201cThere have been confirmed reports by the World Health Organization that there have been cases of resistance in Thailand and Cambodia, and closer to home in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\u201d said Dr Evans Murage, a pharmacist based in Nairobi, Kenya. \u201cThere are cases of the drugs being sold over the counter, leading to their resistance and overuse.

      "bodyText": "For many people, a vacation to the US means heading up New York\u2019s Empire State Building, descending into the Grand Canyon in Arizona or splashing about in the Pacific Ocean in California. Some, however, are choosing to whet their appetites differently, by instead traveling to Iowa, in the middle of the US, to witness the presidential primary elections in person. \u201cI\u2019m kind of too depressed by UK politics,\u201d said Edward Gray, a 21-year-old law student from Essex. \u201cSo I thought I might as well come and be depressed by US politics.\u201d To that end, Gray committed to spending a month in Iowa, along with 24 others. They had booked through Politrip, a bespoke travel company that charges $1,200 a person to ship them around Democratic campaign events. Iowa has an outsized importance in selecting a party\u2019s nominee for president. It is the first state to vote in the primary process, and a good \u2013 or bad \u2013 performance here can make or break presidential campaigns. This year, more than 20 presidential hopefuls are crisscrossing Iowa, kissing babies, eating bad food and sitting on tractors, all with the hope of winning the February 2020 caucus. \u201cI kind of just love the theatrics of a US election. I like my UK politics, but I just find elections fascinating and [in the UK] they only go on for like a month, whereas over here it\u2019s, like, nonstop,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI thought the opportunity to come out here and possibly meet a couple of candidates was an opportunity I didn\u2019t want to miss.\u201d Gray ended up seeing 23 out of 24 major candidates \u2013 many of those at the Iowa state fair, where the Guardian met some of the mostly British and Irish holidaymakers.

Many of the political vacationers end up volunteering for campaigns \u2013 they can express their preferred candidate in advance \u2013 with people knocking on doors in support of candidates such as the New Jersey senator Cory Booker and Warren. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple of people just working summer jobs trying to figure out their next steps, and a lot of people actually who want to do this to get campaign cycle experience on their CV,\u201d said Brown. One of the most intriguing aspects of the 2020 Democratic race is the number of candidates \u2013 many of whom have, to put it generously, little chance of winning. As Brown and the Guardian chatted, a slight man wearing black jeans took to the soapbox stage. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d said one woman. \u201cHis name is \u2026 Joe Sestak,\u201d her partner replied, reading haltingly from a pamphlet.

The Commissioner in charge of legal cannabis sales in Massachusetts has said Britain should follow her state\u2019s example of recruiting ex-drug dealers and people from communities involved in what was once the underground market for marijuana. Ahead of talks with parliamentarians at Westminster this week, Shaleen Title, along with two other US experts on drug liberalisation, revealed that a project is under way in their state \u2013 which legalised the drug in 2016 \u2013 to retrain former cannabis dealers to enter the now legal marijuana industry. Title\u2019s call echoes that of Michael Semple, the EU\u2019s one-time special representative to Afghanistan and negotiator with the Afghan Taliban, who said that a future British government would have to open \u201cpeace talks\u201d with drug gangs if the UK goes for legalisation. He told the Guardian he believes that government, police and other authorities must open dialogue with dealers who face going out of business.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: South Uist, Outer Hebrides For anyone wishing to experience truly wild, but not too remote or challenging, mountain landscapes, the hills on the east side of Uist in the Outer Hebrides provide plenty of opportunity. On South Uist, Beinn Mhor (620 metres), Beinn Corradale (527 metres) and Hecla (606 metres) give great 360-degree views from Skye to St Kilda, and together form an excellent 16-mile ridge walk along which you will be unlikely to meet anyone. They also appear larger than they are, with their bases being at sea level. Staying overnight at the Uisinis bothy will just add to the feeling of adventure. Further north, the lower hills of Eaval and North and South Lee on the east coast of North Uist have equal views and feel similarly remote, and North Lee has a waymarked footpath for the more cautious. \u2022 Walks on South Uist at visitouterhebrides.co.uk Dave Newman Ben Lawers, Highlands At 1,214 metres, Ben Lawers is the 10th-highest on the list of 282 Munros (peaks of over 3,000 feet). While many Munros have a formidable reputation Ben Lawers benefits from an excellent path for the most part and starts at the National Trust car park, already at 700 feet. The views from the summit itself are majestic but the base of this route is a real treat, passing through a national nature reserve abundant in alpine plants and native wildlife. Like all Munro walks, planning and preparation are paramount to enjoying the hills of Scotland. Robin Thomson Hare\u2019s Gap, County Down Northern Ireland\u2019s Mourne Mountains will always be a special place for me and my friends from university in Belfast: it\u2019s just unparalleled in being so close to the city and so rugged and beautiful. The best thing is how accessible the Mournes are to the everyday walker: most people head for the highest peaks in the range, Slieve Donard (853 metres) and Slieve Commedagh (765 metres), but the real gem is to park at the Ott or Trassey car parks and climb Hare\u2019s Gap for stunning views of both the reservoirs inland and back towards the coast. This route also takes you up to follow the famous Mourne Wall, which spans 15 summits, and makes for an iconic picture even if you don\u2019t. From Newcastle there\u2019s a shuttle bus into the Mournes. Rose Winter Dollywagon Pike and Helvellyn, Lake District Grasmere, Fairfield and Helvellyn form a cornerstone of Lake District hiking but the route north-east out of Grasmere, round the back of Stone Arthur and up Tongue Gill to Grisedale Tarn takes walkers through landscape that goes from prehistoric jungle to lakes in a lunar-like landscape in no time at all. From Grisedale Tarn, walkers can head up to Dollywagon Pike (858 metres) and from there take Helvellyn (950 metres) by a ridge walk very different from the usual approach, or enjoy a scramble up to Fairfield Horseshoe and then down to the The Badger Inn at Rydal, for much-deserved refreshment. Joe Irton Fell, Lake District The views around Wasdale in the Lake District are some of the finest in England but the popularity of the nearby hills (Scafell Pike, Great Gable and Pillar) means you have to get creative to avoid the crowds. Irton Fell (395 metres), at the south-eastern end of Wast Water, is less than half the height of the more famous peaks but provides a strenuous and rewarding day out, with a circular walk that takes you from wooded fields to blustery fell top to tranquil lakeside in a few hours. From Gosforth village on the A595, follow the signs to Nether Wasdale and the free walkers\u2019 car park near the bridge over the River Irt. Refuel at the Strands Inn in Nether Wasdale (microbrewery attached), or stop for dinner at the Wild Olive Italian restaurant in Gosforth. \u2022 See walklakes.co.uk Natalie Hogg Carneddau range, Snowdonia Avoid the queues up Snowdon by enjoying the views across to it from the nearby Carneddau range \u2013 that\u2019s what we did on a sunny Easter Sunday. Catch the Snowdon Sherpa bus to Capel Curig or park in the signposted free car park by the A5/A4086 junction. Then take the bridleway by the chapel, passing the head of the Llyn Crafnant reservoir before ascending through the trees to the ridge above Llyn Cowlyd and the peak of Pen Llithrig y Wrach (799 metres). You\u2019ll hardly see a soul as you follow this rocky ridge via Craig Wen (540 metres) and back down to Capel Curig. \u2022 Version of this walk at mudandroutes.com Alison Field Picws Du, Brecon Beacons On a pleasant day, southern Britain\u2019s highest mountain, Pen-y-Fan, can be extremely busy, with queues for summit selfies. To avoid the crowds, and for an even more dramatic walk, head west (around 20 miles from Pen-y-Fan) to Picws Du (749 metres) and Fan Foel (781 metres). This majestic ridge arcs around two inky-blue lakes and offers stunning views in all directions, particularly east, back towards the heart of the Brecon Beacons. A route over the two main summits and back will take around six strenuous hours. The YHA Llanddeusant hostel is a half-hour walk away, and there is parking at the foot of the ascent. \u2022 Similar walks at walkingclub.org.uk and mudandroutes.com Jamie Askew Yr Eifl, Ll\u0177n peninsula, Gwynedd About an hour\u2019s drive from Snowdon, a much less well-known (and far less challenging) walk awaits you in Yr Eifl (446 metres), a hill on the north coast of the Ll\u0177n peninsula. On your walk to the top, you will come across one of the most spectacular ancient monuments in Wales, Tre\u2019r Ceiri, an iron-age hillfort with largely intact stone walls.

O\u2019Grady warned of rising inequality and insecurity at work. The peak body of unions says in a report ahead of its annual conference next week that despite a recent pick-up in earnings, workers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/uk-faces-victorian-age-of-inequality-says-tuc-general-secretary\">still facing the longest pay squeeze for 200 years</a>. The share of economic output going to wages has declined from an average of 57% in the three decades after the second world war to 49% in 2018. The TUC is calling for greater rights to negotiate collective bargaining agreements, including agreements covering whole sectors like hospitality; a \u00a310-an-hour minimum wage; a ban on zero-hours contracts; and access for unions to promote membership to employees in all workplaces.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Fake news storm \u2013 </strong>Donald Trump has appeared in front of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hurricane-dorian-bahamas-death-toll-devastation\">Hurricane Dorian</a> map where Alabama appears to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/trump-hurricane-dorian-alabama-sharpie-map\">drawn into the storm front using a marker pen</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64e123f3f30dc067ba8fbe9bda875da8b8183962\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64e123f3f30dc067ba8fbe9bda875da8b8183962/0_0_3687_2212/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump holds a chart showing Hurricane Dorian\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump holds a chart showing Hurricane Dorian\u2019s course.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Benn bill back to Commons by Friday afternoon Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray here and don\u2019t worry, it will all become clearer in a moment or two. The House of Lords has agreed overnight to get the Benn bill ruling out a no-deal Brexit through all stages of parliament before it is suspended by Boris Johnson. Around 1.30 this morning, following late-night debate, peers were told a Conservative filibuster had been averted by a \u201cguillotine\u201d and the bill \u2013 passed on Wednesday by rebel Tories and the opposition in the Commons \u2013 could be returned to the lower house by 5pm tomorrow. We will be picking apart the implications in our politics live blog, which is up and running. Lord Ashton of Hyde told peers: \u201cWe have also received a commitment from the chief whip in the House of Commons that Commons consideration of any Lords amendments will take place on Monday and it is the government\u2019s intention that the bill be ready for royal assent.\u201d Peers are set to begin debating the bill and their own amendments today after a fresh business motion is put forward by Lady Smith of Basildon, the Labour leader in the Lords. As the Lords session drew to an end, Richard Newby, the leader of the Lib Dems in the Lords, joked to the chamber that he was pleased not to have to stay all night and use his duvet. The developments come after Johnson suffered three heavy commons defeats in his first legislative outings as prime minister. They included failing to secure a general election, with Jeremy Corbyn insisting that the Benn bill must be passed and receive royal assent first. The legal and political siege of the PM continues today as a court challenge is mounted to his plan to prorogue parliament. Lawyers for Gina Miller and her supporters will argue at the high court in London that Johnson asked the Queen to suspend parliament so he could prevent MPs scrutinising the government\u2019s Brexit plans and blocking a no-deal exit from the EU \u2013 an illegal breach of parliamentary sovereignty, it will be said. And, you wouldn\u2019t read about it \u2013 at least not normally \u2013 but now might be a good time to look at these books that seek to explain parliament. * * * Deadly fireworks blast \u2013 An explosion at a fireworks factory has killed at least 20 people in India. Police said 15 other people were injured in Wednesday\u2019s blast in Batala, a town in Punjab state about 460km (285 miles) north of New Delhi. A local politician said the factory was illegal and pictures showed it reduced to a pile of bricks. Fireworks manufacturing is a big business in India, with crackers often used in festivals and weddings. Many illegal factories produce firecrackers that are cheaper to buy. * * * \u2018Snack tax\u2019 \u2013 There\u2019s a bit of that old staple of public health news around today. A levy of 20% on biscuits, cakes and sweets could lead to the average Briton losing 1.3kg over the course of one year, obesity researchers have calculated. The effect would be greater among the lowest income families, where obesity levels are highest. In some countries sugar intake is mostly from drinks, but the UK is keener on sweets and cakes \u2013 a similar price increase on sugary drinks would result in a much lower average weight loss of 203g. Researchers writing in the British Medical Journal say the UK should consider a \u201csnack tax\u201d. A separate study in the BMJ suggests that vegetarians have a lower risk of heart attack, but may be in greater danger of a stroke. And the Royal College of GPs has criticised NHS England\u2019s proposal to let pharmacies diagnose high cholesterol and dispense statins without a doctor\u2019s involvement. * * * \u2018Bring back union power\u2019 \u2013 Britain risks turning the clock back to the Victorian age without a shift in the balance of power from employers to unions, Frances O\u2019Grady, the head of the TUC, has said. O\u2019Grady warned of rising inequality and insecurity at work. The peak body of unions says in a report ahead of its annual conference next week that despite a recent pick-up in earnings, workers are still facing the longest pay squeeze for 200 years. The share of economic output going to wages has declined from an average of 57% in the three decades after the second world war to 49% in 2018. The TUC is calling for greater rights to negotiate collective bargaining agreements, including agreements covering whole sectors like hospitality; a \u00a310-an-hour minimum wage; a ban on zero-hours contracts; and access for unions to promote membership to employees in all workplaces. * * * Fake news storm \u2013 Donald Trump has appeared in front of a Hurricane Dorian map where Alabama appears to have been drawn into the storm front using a marker pen. It was apparently a belated effort to justify Trump\u2019s previous baseless claims that the latter state could be affected, when forecasters say it is out of harm\u2019s way. * * * Plasticene era? \u2013 Plastic pollution is being deposited into the fossil record, research has found. Scientists suggest the plastic layers could be used to mark the start of the Anthropocene \u2013 the proposed geological epoch in which human activities have dominated the shaping of the planet. Analysis of sediment from off the coast of California dating back to 1834 showed layers mirroring the explosion in plastic production over the past 70 years \u2013 with the level doubling about every 15 years, researchers have said. \u201cPlastic was invented and pretty much immediately we can see it appear in the sedimentary record,\u201d said Jennifer Brandon, from the University of California San Diego.

Plus Lily Kuo on a huge moment in Hong Kong as protests force the withdrawal of the extradition bill. Lunchtime read: Johnson government\u2019s women problem With a resolutely male inner circle and the sacking of four female aides, it\u2019s no surprise that accusations of misogyny have been levelled by the opposition. The question is whether it makes a difference at the ballot box, writes Gaby Hinsliff. Sport Steve Smith was seeing it like a beachball once more as a day of excellence from Australia\u2019s premier batsman and strong winds scotched the notion of momentum, even if Stuart Broad proved to be David Warner\u2019s nemesis yet again, dismissing the opener for the fifth time this Ashes series.

The best lexicon is the very entertaining Would They Lie to You? by Robert Hutton, which will help you understand what politicians are actually saying, while also making you profoundly dispirited about the way politics is conducted. See also Peter Oborne\u2019s The Rise of Political Lying and The Triumph of the Political Class. A kindlier look at the psyche of MPs is The House of Commons: An Anthropology of MPs at Work by Emma Crewe. It\u2019s a little out of date, but some of the anecdotes are particularly useful. Crewe managed to spend a fair bit of time talking to an eccentric backbencher about how his whips often phoned to check he was definitely rebelling against the party. Most MPs would never give her such access today. Also from a previous political era but eEssential to understanding what goes on when MPs decide to vote against their party are two books by the witty politics professor Philip Cowley. The Rebels and Revolts and Rebellions cover the Blair era, but some of those mistakes are being repeated now, or were too risky to contemplate more than a decade ago. If he takes another look at this bunch, his books will run to several volumes. \u2022 Why We Get the Wrong Politicians by Isabel Hardman is published by Atlantic.",

      "bodyText": "Stay tuned for the full match report, which is coming shortly. But for now, it\u2019s goodbye. \u201cWhen he is under confidence he\u2019s very difficult to stop,\u201d says Nadal after reaching the semi-finals at the US Open for an eighth time and 33rd at a major tournament. \u201cOf course I made some mistake, but I\u2019m super happy the way I accepted the situation and I accepted the challenge. Here I am in the semi-finals. It\u2019s super important to me. It means everything.\u201d When asked about his fitness, Nadal insists he\u2019s OK despite those visits from the trainer in the final set. \u201cPhysically I cam fine,\u201d he says. \u201cToday was a very heavy day. Big humidity. I am this kind of player where I sweat a bit. Sometimes under these conditions it\u2019s tough, but honestly I am happy that I had some critical moments at the end of the second and the beginning of the third.\u201d Nadal is the final player through to the men\u2019s semi-finals, joining Grigor Dimitrov, Matteo Berrettini and Daniil Medvedev. Nadal breaks in eight game of third set! Nadal rips a forehand winner on Schwartzman\u2019s serve and he\u2019s three points from the finish line. Schwartzman wins the next points but Nadal outlasts him over a 14-stroke rally on the next point for 30-all. Nadal forces his opponent into a forehand error for match point ... then closes it out with a volley winner at the net! Third set: *Schwartzman 4-6, 5-7, 2-5 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal holds at love and Schwartzman will serve to stay in the tournament. Third set: Schwartzman 4-6, 5-7, 2-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server) The trainer is out again for Nadal during the changeover. It\u2019s 12.30am but the humidity has in fact gone up since the start of the match. Now he takes the baseline to return and Schwartzman quickly falls behind love-40 after a handful of scratchy points. It\u2019s triple break point for Nadal and he\u2019ll be within touching distance of the semi-finals if he can convert. Schwartzman saves the first, but sends a lob past the baseline on the second and Nadal has broken. The end is nigh. Third set: *Schwartzman 4-6, 5-7, 2-3 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal appears to be cramping slightly in the humid conditions, flexing his left and then his right arm while serving. But it didn\u2019t hamper him too much during that service game, where he\u2019s just held easily. Third set: Schwartzman 4-6, 5-7, 2-2 Nadal* (*denotes next server) A trainer was out for Nadal during the changeover and he was rubbing cream on Spaniard\u2019s forearm, but it wasn\u2019t a proper medical timeout. Schwartzman used the time for a bathroom break and to change rackets. When play resumes the Argentine wins four quick points from love-15 down for the comfortable hold. Third set: *Schwartzman 4-6, 5-7, 1-2 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal breezes to a comfortable hold and we\u2019re on serve going into the changeover. Schwartzman is not making it easy, but he\u2019s not making it too hard for the 2010, 2013 and 2017 US Open champion. Third set: Schwartzman 4-6, 5-7, 1-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Schwartzman is pushed to 30-all on his serve, but Nadal gifts the next point with his 34th unforced error before the Argentine crushes a 109mph ace out wide to hold. Third set: *Schwartzman 4-6, 5-7, 0-1 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal holds in the opening game of the third set but he\u2019s made to work for it in an eight-point service game as we cross into the other side of midnight here in Flushing Meadow. Nadal breaks in 12th game of second set! Second set: Schwartzman 4-6, 5-7 Nadal Nadal pounces on a 75mph second serve then rips a passing winner on the first point of the game. Then Schwartzman double-faults for love-30. Nadal then pounds a forehand winner for triple set point. Schwartzman saves the first, then outlasts Nadal over a 15-shot rally to erase the second. Now a third set point and this time Nadal converts when the Argentine sends it into the net. Second set: *Schwartzman 4-6, 5-6 Nadal (*denotes next server) The undersized Argentine is hanging in some grueling rallies, but Nadal is able to steady the ship despite the apparent disappearance of his forehand, punctuating an important hold with a 106mph ace out wide. Schwartzman will serve to force a tiebreaker after the change of ends. Second set: Schwartzman 4-6, 5-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Schwartzman holds at love and he\u2019s won eight straight points on his racket after that disastrous service game at 1-4. Second set: *Schwartzman 4-6, 4-5 Nadal (*denotes next server) Can you believe this? Schwartzman pushes Nadal to 30-all, then watches the Spaniard misfire on a forehand then at the net for a break of serve! He\u2019s back on even terms from two breaks down for the second set in a row. Can he back up the break? Second set: Schwartzman 4-6, 3-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Schwartzman races to four straight points for a hold at love, including a 98mph ace out wide. Now the Argentine will try to break Nadal yet again to overcome a double-break deficit for the second set in a row. Second set: *Schwartzman 4-6, 2-5 Nadal (*denotes next server) Schwartzman brings the crowd to its feet with a forehand passing winner on the second point of the game and pushes Nadal to 30-all, then 30-40 when Nadal makes his first double fault of the set. The Spaniard saves it when he rushes to the net and Schwartzman goes wide on the passing shot for deuce. The Argentine earns another break point with a forehand volley winner and then he converts with a forehand winner from the baseline! He\u2019s got one of the breaks back and now will serve to stay in the set. Nadal breaks in sixth game of second set! Second set: Schwartzman 4-6, 1-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Schwartzman\u2019s first serve is betraying him as he loses four straight points from 15-love and is broken. Nadal to serve for a two-sets-to-none lead with new balls. Second set: *Schwartzman 4-6, 1-4 Nadal (*denotes next server) Schwartzman is showing good fight, winning an 18-stroke rally with a backhand winner from the baseline for a love-15 lead on Nadal\u2019s serve. Now the crowd is abuzz as Nadal falls behind love-30. He wins a pair of quick points, appears to go ahead 40-30 on an ace that\u2019s ruled a let and taken off the board, then goes behind 30-40 after another wayward forehand. But Nadal saves the break point with a 119mph ace down the middle and follows with a forehand winner then a 126mph down the pipe for the hold. Some response, that. Nadal breaks in fourth game of second set! Second set: Schwartzman 4-6, 1-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server) A chance here for Nadal as Schwartzman falls behind love-30 after an unforced error off the forehand and a double fault. The Argentine rattles off three quick points from there, but Schwartman then misfires with a forehand for deuce. A tense back-and-forth ensues until Nadal rips a backhand passing winner down the line for a break point, then converts with an overhand winner to cap a 14-shot baseline rally. Second set: *Schwartzman 4-6, 1-2 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal holds at love and we\u2019re breezing right along on serve in the second. Second set: Schwartzman 4-6, 1-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Schwartzman answers Nadal\u2019s comfortable service game with a stress-free hold of his own. Second set: *Schwartzman 4-6, 0-1 Nadal (*denotes next server) A complete gear change for Nadal during the setbreak. A bit of a longer delay than there should have been, really. But we\u2019re back up and running and Nadal holds easily to open the second. Nadal breaks in 10th game of first set! First set: Schwartzman 4-6 Nadal All that hard work by Schwartzman to fight back to level terms and Nadal brushes it all aside, breaking the Argentine to take the opening set after 57 minutes! First set: *Schwartzman 4-5 Nadal (*denotes next server) A few more loose points by Nadal on his serve and he\u2019s fallen behind 15-40, giving Schwartzman a couple more break-point opportunities. He saves the first with a 99mph second serve that Schwartzman can\u2019t return, then the second when the Argentine is a split-second short chasing down a drop shot after a big serve out wide. Nadal follows with an overhand winner punctuated by a fist pump for game point, but he misses another forehand wide for deuce. We\u2019re still in the first set and the No 2 seed has made 10 of his 12 unforced errors off the forehand side. Nadal wins the next point with another big second serve, but Schwartzman pushes it back to deuce with a lob winner capping a 16-stroke rally. From there Nadal is able to hold with a pair of quick points and Schwartzman will serve to stay in the first set. First set: Schwartzman 4-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Schwartzman holds comfortably and he\u2019s won 13 of the last 15 points. Nadal beginning to mix in more errors but the Argentine is swinging freely and playing lights out. Schwartzman breaks in seventh game of first set! First set: *Schwartzman 3-4 Nadal (*denotes next server) Well now! Schwartzman rips a pair of forehand baseline winners on Nadal\u2019s serve, sending the crowd into a Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9 chant between points. He then hits his sixth winner of the night to give himself three break-point chances. What a turnaround! Nadal saves the first when the Argentine makes an unforced error from the baseline, but Schwartzman gets the best of the Spaniard over a 22-shot exchange on the next point and they\u2019re back on level turns in the opening set! First set: Schwartzman 2-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Schwartzman races ahead to 40-love after Nadal misses and overhead smash, then holds at love as the crowd rallies behind him. Schwartzman breaks in fifth game of first set! First set: *Schwartzman 1-4 Nadal (*denotes next server) Schwartzman scratches his way into Nadal\u2019s serve at love-30, even if it may be for naught down a double break. The Spaniard answers with a sharply angled cross-court backhand winner that paints the line, but he then puts a forehand into the net for 15-40 and Schwartzman has a pair of break-point chances. Nadal saves the first with a 121mph ace down the middle (which his opponent challenges unsuccessfully), then sprays a forehand wide and Schwartzman is back within a break. Nadal breaks in fourth game of first set! First set: Schwartzman 0-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server) An uphill climb for Schwartzman just got a little bit harder as he falls behind love-30 and then 30-40 before Nadal breaks him again with a sizzling inside-out forehand into the corner which the Argentine dumps into the net. First set: *Schwartzman 0-3 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal consolidates the break with another easy service game. He\u2019s won eight of nine points on his racket and is averaging more than 120mph on his first serve. Looking sharp early on is the second-seeded Spaniard. Nadal breaks in second game of first set! First set: Schwartzman 0-2 Nadal* (*denotes next server) Well if this is a sign of things to come, it could be an even more difficult night for Schwartzman than we thought. Not only does Nadal break the Argentine on his first offering, but pressures him throughout a 16-point service game where Schwartzman is made to save three break points before succumbing on the fourth after a grueling 16-shot rally from the baseline. You\u2019re gonna need a bigger boat. First set: *Schwartzman 0-1 Nadal (*denotes next server) Nadal breezes through his opening game with a hold at love. Schwartzman and Nadal are making their way onto the court for tonight\u2019s nightcap. Here\u2019s a look at how they match up. \u201cThis is honestly so crazy,\u201d Andreescu says during her on-court interview. \u201cA year ago I was in the (US Open) qualifying round. I remember I was suffering from a back injury. Now what I\u2019ve accomplished this year, I\u2019m honestly speechless. I need someone to pinch me right now. Is this real life?\u201d When asked where her composure comes from, the 19-year-old says: \u201cI think it\u2019s just the experience from playing these huge tournaments in the past year. I played in front of a huge crowd at Australia and Indian Wells and Toronto and I think all that experience is catching up.\u201d Third set: Andreescu 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 Mertens Andreescu wins a point at the net and she\u2019s three points from the semi-finals. She follows with an unforced error but then hits a 103mph ace out wide to move even closer. Another big serve that Mertens can\u2019t return gives Andreescu a match point ... and she closes the show with a backhand winner down the line to book a place in the last four! Andreescu breaks Mertens in eighth game of third set! Third set: *Andreescu 3-6, 6-2, 5-3 Mertens (*denotes next server) Andreescu takes control of the first point on Mertens\u2019 service game, winning it when the Belgian sends a backhand flying past the baseline. Mertens then hit\u2019s an ace but it\u2019s taken off the board after a challenge \u2013 followed promptly by a double fault for love-30. Another error gives Andreescu three break points. Mertens saves the first when the Canadian sends a backhand into the alleyway, then another when a forehand sails past the baseline. But the third time is the charm for Andreescu and she rips a punishing backhand return winner down the line for the break! The highest-ranked teenager on the tour will serve for the match! Third set: Andreescu 3-6, 6-2, 4-3 Mertens* (*denotes next server) Andreescu showing the slightest signs of fatigue in these muggy conditions, making an effort to shorten the points with more of a quick-strike game. But she holds at love and it\u2019s Mertens\u2019 turn to keep pace after the changeover. Third set: *Andreescu 3-6, 6-2, 3-3 Mertens (*denotes next server) A chance for Andreescu now as Mertens falls behind 15-30 on her serve. She then rips a forehand winner down the line for double break point. Big moment. Mertens saves the first by winning a baseline rally when Andreescu sends a forehand into the net, then another with a beautifully constructed point ending with an overhand winner. Andreescu misfires on another attempted return winner, then hits an unreturnable serve for the crucial hold from 15-40 down. Third set: Andreescu 3-6, 6-2, 3-2 Mertens* (*denotes next server) Mertens pounces on a 92mph first serve out wide for a return winner, but Andreescu answers with a point at the net for 15-all. Andreescu then mixes in her third double fault of the match for 15-30 (which she challenges unsuccessfully), then rips a cross-court winner into the corner that Mertens can barely get a racket on for 30-all. Andreescu then crushes a 111mph service winner \u2013 her fastest serve of the night so far \u2013 and follows with another point at the net to hold. Mertens to serve at 2-3 coming out of the changeover. Third set: *Andreescu 3-6, 6-2, 2-2 Mertens (*denotes next server) Mertens, who\u2019s been made to labor in her previous two service games, gets a much-needed easy love hold. Third set: Andreescu 3-6, 6-2, 2-1 Mertens* (*denotes next server) Andreescu finds herself in a spot of trouble down 15-30 after her 26th and 27th unforced errors of the night (compared to 32 winners). But she follows with three quick points to hold and the players will change ends. Third set: *Andreescu 3-6, 6-2, 1-1 Mertens (*denotes next server) Andreescu sets up another point on Mertens\u2019 serve with a drop shot, then misses a volley at the net for 15-all. The Canadian then rips a winner early in the point to apply more pressure at 15-30, but Mertens is able to fight back for deuce. A crucial moment early in the third. Mertens follows by returning an Andreescu overhead with a backhand winner down the line, but Andreescu answers with a backhand winner from the baseline for a second deuce. Mertens then blinks first in a 10-shot baseline rally, but saves the break point with a 106mph ace out wide for deuce once more. Mertens hits a 116mph ace down the middle for an apparent game point, but Andreescu successfully challenges it and it\u2019s off the board. Deuce. An unforced error by Mertens off the backhand gives Andreescu another break-point chance and the Belgian saves that one, too. Deuce number four. Andreescu then loads up on an attempted return winner off a 77mph second serve by Mertens, but sends it into the tramlines ... and Mertens follows with a backhand winner on the 14th point of the game to hold. On serve early in the decider. Third set: Andreescu 3-6, 6-2, 1-0 Mertens* (*denotes next server) Andreescu holds comfortably to open the third set, capping it off with a backhand volley winner set up with a lovely drop shot. Both players have left the court for a gear change ahead of the third set. Here\u2019s a promising stat for Andreescu supporters. The Canadian has played 42 tour-level matches in her career to date. Nineteen of those went the full three-set distance. Andreescu won 13 of those 19, including nine coming from a set down. Second set: Andreescu 3-6, 6-2 Mertens Mertens double-faults and watches Andreescu rip a forehand winner for 30-love. The Belgian then falls behind 15-40, but saves a pair of break points (and set points) with a couple of big serves for deuce. An unforced error by Mertens off the backhand gives Andreescu a third set point and this time she converts with a picture-perfect forehand into the corner. We\u2019re heading to a decider! Second set: Andreescu 3-6, 5-2 Mertens* (*denotes next server) Two quick points for Andreescu including a forehand winner at the net, where she\u2019s 15 of 19 on the night. Mertens pulls one back on a forced error, but Andreescu rips her 22nd winner followed by a service winner to consolidate the break. She\u2019s won 10 of the last 11 points and Mertens will now serve to stay in the second set. Andreescu breaks in sixth game of second set! Second set: *Andreescu 3-6, 4-2 Mertens (*denotes next server) A golden chance for Andreescu as Mertens plays a few loose points to fall behind love-40. And the Canadian breaks at love with a blistering cross-court forehand that her opponent can barely stab at. Second set: Andreescu 3-6, 3-2 Mertens* (*denotes next server) Andreescu makes her second double fault of the night then falls behind love-30 with another unforced error. Danger zone. But the Canadian digs in and wins four straight points, including a crushing forehand winner to hold. Second set: *Andreescu 3-6, 2-2 Mertens (*denotes next server) Andreescu showing a bit of fire as Mertens falls behind 15-40 on her serve, but the Belgian coolly saves both. Mertens then holds with a winner up the line after Andreescu overhits a forehand at deuce. Mertens breaks in third game of second set! Second set: Andreescu 3-6, 2-1 Mertens* (*denotes next server) Andreescu opens with an overhand winner and she\u2019s won the last six points. But Mertens takes the next three in a row on a forehand winner and a pair of Andreescu unforced errors and the Belgian will have two changes to get the break right back. Another botched sliced backhand by the Canadian on the next point and we\u2019re back on level terms in the second. Andreescu breaks in second game of second set! Second set: *Andreescu 3-6, 2-0 Mertens (*denotes next server) A chance here for Andreescu as Mertens goes love-30 down. Then a first double fault of the night for Belgian and Andreescu will have three break-point opportunities. She needs only the first as Mertens dumps a forehand into the net from the middle of the court and Andreescu is out in front in the secon. Second set: Andreescu 3-6, 1-0 Mertens* (*denotes next server) Andreescu opens the second set with her first double fault of the night, then wins three straight points and seems on her way to a stress-free hold. But Mertens follows with a backhand winner to win a 12-stroke exchage, then Andreescu makes another miscue at the net for deuce. Before it can get too hairy, the Canadian hits her 13th and 14th winners of the night to hold. First set: Andreescu 3-6 Mertens Mertens holds at love and she\u2019s halfway home after 38 minutes. The No 25 seed won 21 of 27 points (77.7%) on her serve in the opener, including nine of 11 (81.8%) on her second serve. Her nine sets at this year\u2019s US Open: 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1, 6-1, 6-3. First set: Andreescu 3-5 Mertens* (*denotes next server) An easy service game for Andreescu, who holds at love and hits three forehand winners on the way. Mertens to serve for the opener. First set: *Andreescu 2-5 Mertens (*denotes next server) It\u2019s another easy hold for Mertens, who\u2019s won 12 of 15 points on her serve after getting pushed in her opening service game. Andreescu will serve to stay in the first set after the changeover. First set: Andreescu 2-4 Mertens* (*denotes next server) Mertens, returning with aggression and accuracy, wins a pair of quick points including a second return winner and Andreescu is love-30 down. The Belgian has won 14 of the last 17 points and is playing far more solid tennis in the early going. She makes an unforced error on the next point but then hits a highlight-reel backhand pass winner after chasing down an Andreescu drop shot for 15-40 and a pair of break points. Andreescu saves the first with a 93mph second serve to Mertens\u2019 forehand, then another with a 101mph service winner down the winner for deuce punctuated with a enthusaistic \u201cCome on!\u201d The Canadian follows with an overhand winner at the net, but Mertens gets it back to deuce when Andreescu overcooks a backhand again. Mertens then rips a forehand winner from the baseline for a third break-point chance in this game, but she mishits a volley on the next point and we\u2019re back to deuce. Andreescu saves a fourth break point moments later with a 97mph ace out wide, her first of the night. Then wins two quick points to escape with the hold after a 14-point game. It\u2019s been a battle for the Canadian early on as Mertens has been completely dialed in, but she\u2019s only a break down. First set: *Andreescu 1-4 Mertens (*denotes next server) Mertens falls behind 15-30 after three quick points and Andreescu may have a chance to break right back. But the Belgians rattles off three in a row, including an 11th unforced error by the Canadian on game point, to consolidate the break as the players change ends. Andreescu\u2019s timing on the return seems off in the early going, but there\u2019s time still to right the ship. Mertens breaks in fourth game of first set! First set: Andreescu 1-3 Mertens* (*denotes next server) Mertens continues to take the return early Andreescu makes her sixth and seventh unforced errors on the night, both off the backhand side, to fall behind 15-30. The Belgian then gets the best of a 10-stroke rally and she will have a pair of break points on Andreescu\u2019s serve. She only needs one as Andreescu dumps a volley into the net on the approach to draw first blood in the opener. First set: *Andreescu 1-2 Mertens (*denotes next server) It\u2019s an easy love hold for Mertens, who\u2019s gotten four of her last six first serves in after only one of her first six. First set: Andreescu 1-1 Mertens* (*denotes next server) Andreescu hits a pair of forehand winners, but Mertens steps in and takes the ball early on the next point and hits a forehand winner for 30-15. Andreescu follows with a forehand winner from the baseline, then a service winner for a comfortable first hold. First set: *Andreescu 0-1 Mertens (*denotes next server) Andreescu has an immediate opportunity as Mertens quickly loses the first two points to fall behind love-30 on her serve, the second on an 18-stroke rally capped by a forehand winner by the Canadian. Mertens then goes down 15-40 and Andreescu has a couple of break points. The Belgian saves the first when Andreescu tries and fails for a big return winner, then another when the Canadian makes an unforced error with the forehand. Mertens than rattles off two points in fast order to hold in her opening service game. The players have made their way from the tunnel onto the court as Ashe continues to fill. It\u2019s another muggy night on the grounds: 82F (28C) with 64% humidity as the sun descends over the Manhattan skyline. The quarter-finalists now come together at the net for the coin toss. Mertens calls heads, it comes up tails and Andreescu elects to receive. We should be under way shortly from the world\u2019s largest tennis stadium. Here\u2019s a look at how Andreescu and Mertens match up ahead of tonight\u2019s first quarter-final. They\u2019ve combined to drop only one set at this year\u2019s US Open, though Mertens has spent 20 minutes less time on court per match against a far better class of opponent based on their WTA rankings. Tonight\u2019s winner advances a semi-final clash in Thursday\u2019s nightcap on Ashe against 13th-seeded Belinda Bencic, who came through earlier today with a straight-sets win over Donna Veki\u0107. A quick scheduling note as we wait for Ashe to open for the night session. Thursday\u2019s preliminary order of play is out and the times for the women\u2019s semi-final double-header have been set. No 5 Elina Svitolina will meet No 8 Serena Williams at 7pm local time on Ashe, followed by No 13 Belinda Bencic and either Andreescu or Mertens. Hello and welcome to Arthur Ashe Stadium for tonight\u2019s US Open quarter-final doubleheader. We\u2019ve got a pair of delicious matches in store with Canada\u2019s Bianca Andreescu facing Belgium\u2019s Elise Mertens and Spain\u2019s Rafael Nadal meeting Argentina\u2019s Diego Schwartzman, both for places in the semi-finals later this week. We may have a bit of a delayed start for tonight\u2019s women\u2019s opener as the third men\u2019s quarter-final between Mattero Berrettini and Gael Monfils has only just ended on Ashe with the 24th-seeded Berrettini winning 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (5) in a thriller that lasted nearly four hours. The day session crowd will need to exit the main show court before the night session mass is admitted and the players are called on court. Plenty to come between now and then. Thanks for following along with us. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s column off Roger Federer\u2019s shock defeat to Grigor Dimitrov last night.",

      "body": "<p>We learn to lie as children, between the ages of two and five. By adulthood, we are prolific. We lie to our employers, our partners and, most of all, one study has found, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8689010.stm\" title=\"\">to our mothers</a>. The average person hears up to 200 lies a day, according to research by Jerry Jellison, a psychologist at the University of Southern California. The majority of the lies we tell are \u201cwhite\u201d, the inconsequential niceties \u2013 \u201cI love your dress!\u201d \u2013 that grease the wheels of human interaction. But most people tell one or two \u201cbig\u201d lies a day, says Richard Wiseman, a psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire. We lie to promote ourselves, protect ourselves and to hurt or avoid hurting others.</p> <p>The mystery is how we keep getting away with it. Our bodies expose us in every way. Hearts race, sweat drips and micro-expressions leak from small muscles in the face. We stutter, stall and make Freudian slips. \u201cNo mortal can keep a secret,\u201d wrote the psychoanalyst in 1905. \u201cIf his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips. Betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, we are hopeless at spotting deception. On average, across 206 scientific studies, people can separate truth from lies just 54% of the time \u2013 only marginally better than tossing a coin. \u201cPeople are bad at it because the differences between truth-tellers and liars are typically small and unreliable,\u201d said Aldert Vrij, a psychologist at the University of Portsmouth who has spent years studying ways to detect deception. Some people stiffen and freeze when put on the spot, others become more animated. Liars can spin yarns packed with colour and detail, and truth-tellers can seem vague and evasive.</p> <p>Humans have been trying to overcome this problem for millennia. The search for a perfect lie detector has involved torture, trials by ordeal and, in ancient India, <a href=\"https://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/truth-about-lie-detection-ancient-and-modern-times-002125\" title=\"\">an encounter with a donkey</a> in a dark room. Three thousand years ago in China, the accused were forced to chew and spit out rice; the grains were thought to stick in the dry, nervous mouths of the guilty. In 1730, the English writer Daniel Defoe suggested taking the pulse of suspected pickpockets. \u201cGuilt carries fear always about with it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is a tremor in the blood of a thief.\u201d More recently, lie detection has largely been equated with the juddering styluses of the polygraph machine \u2013 the quintessential lie detector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/21/reality-tv-lie-detectors-may-face-ban-after-deaths-of-participants\" title=\"\">beloved by</a> daytime television hosts and police procedurals. But none of these methods has yielded a reliable way to separate fiction from fact.</p> <p>That could soon change. In the past couple of decades, the rise of cheap computing power, brain-scanning technologies and artificial intelligence has given birth to what many claim is a powerful new generation of lie-detection tools. Startups, racing to commercialise these developments, want us to believe that a virtually infallible lie detector is just around the corner.</p> <p>Their inventions are being snapped up by police forces, state agencies and nations desperate to secure themselves against foreign threats. They are also being used by employers, insurance companies and welfare officers. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in interest from both the private sector and within government,\u201d said Todd Mickelsen, the CEO of Converus, which makes a lie detector based on eye movements and subtle changes in pupil size.</p> <p>Converus\u2019s technology, EyeDetect, has been used by FedEx in Panama and Uber in Mexico to screen out drivers with criminal histories, and by the credit ratings agency Experian, which tests its staff in Colombia to make sure they aren\u2019t manipulating the company\u2019s database to secure loans for family members. In the UK, Northumbria police are carrying out a pilot scheme that uses EyeDetect to measure the rehabilitation of sex offenders. Other EyeDetect customers include the government of Afghanistan, McDonald\u2019s and dozens of local police departments in the US. Soon, large-scale lie-detection programmes could be coming to the borders of the US and the European Union, where they would flag potentially deceptive travellers for further questioning.</p> <p>But as tools such as EyeDetect infiltrate more and more areas of public and private life, there are urgent questions to be answered about their scientific validity and ethical use. In our age of high surveillance and anxieties about all-powerful AIs, the idea that a machine could read our most personal thoughts feels more plausible than ever to us as individuals, and to the governments and corporations funding the new wave of lie-detection research. But what if states and employers come to believe in the power of a lie-detection technology that proves to be deeply biased \u2013 or that doesn\u2019t actually work?</p> <p>And what do we do with these technologies if they do succeed? A machine that reliably sorts truth from falsehood could have profound implications for human conduct. The creators of these tools argue that by weeding out deception they can create a fairer, safer world. But the ways lie detectors have been used in the past suggests such claims may be far too optimistic.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For most of us, most of the time, lying is more taxing and more stressful than honesty. To calculate another person\u2019s view, suppress emotions and hold back from blurting out the truth requires more thought and more energy than simply being honest. It demands that we bear what psychologists call a cognitive load. Carrying that burden, most lie-detection theories assume, leaves evidence in our bodies and actions.</p> <p>Lie-detection technologies tend to examine five different types of evidence. The first two are verbal: the things we say and the way we say them. Jeff Hancock, an expert on digital communication at Stanford, has found that people who are lying in their online dating profiles tend to use the words \u201cI\u201d, \u201cme\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d more often, for instance. Voice-stress analysis, which aims to detect deception based on changes in tone of voice, was used during the interrogation of George Zimmerman, who shot the teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, and by UK councils between 2007 and 2010 in a pilot scheme that tried to catch benefit cheats over the phone. Only five of the 23 local authorities where voice analysis was trialled judged it a success, but in 2014, it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/10/councils-use-lie-detector-tests-benefits-fraudsters\" title=\"\">still in use in 20 councils</a>, according to freedom of information requests by the campaign group False Economy.</p> <p>The third source of evidence \u2013 body language \u2013 can also reveal hidden feelings. Some liars display so-called \u201cduper\u2019s delight\u201d, a fleeting expression of glee that crosses the face when they think they have got away with it. Cognitive load makes people move differently, and liars trying to \u201cact natural\u201d can end up doing the opposite. In an experiment in 2015, researchers at the University of Cambridge were able to detect deception more than 70% of the time by using a skintight suit to measure how much subjects fidgeted and froze under questioning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fourth type of evidence is physiological. The polygraph measures blood pressure, breathing rate and sweat. Penile plethysmography tests arousal levels in sex offenders by measuring the engorgement of the penis using a special cuff. Infrared cameras analyse facial temperature. Unlike Pinocchio, our noses may actually shrink slightly when we lie as warm blood flows towards the brain.</p> <p>In the 1990s, new technologies opened up a fifth, ostensibly more direct avenue of investigation: the brain. In the second season of the Netflix documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/making-a-murderer\" title=\"\">Making a Murderer</a>, Steven Avery, who is serving a life sentence for a brutal killing he says he did not commit, undergoes a \u201cbrain fingerprinting\u201d exam, which uses an electrode-studded headset called an electroencephalogram, or EEG, to read his neural activity and translate it into waves rising and falling on a graph. The test\u2019s inventor, Dr Larry Farwell, claims it can detect knowledge of a crime hidden in a suspect\u2019s brain by picking up a neural response to phrases or pictures relating to the crime that only the perpetrator and investigators would recognise. Another EEG-based test was used in 2008 to convict a 24-year-old Indian woman named Aditi Sharma of murdering her fiance by lacing his food with arsenic, but Sharma\u2019s sentence was eventually overturned on appeal when the Indian supreme court held that the test could violate the subject\u2019s rights against self-incrimination.</p> <p>After 9/11, the US government \u2013 long an enthusiastic sponsor of deception science \u2013 started funding other kinds of brain-based lie-detection work through Darpa, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency. By 2006, two companies \u2013 Cephos and No Lie MRI \u2013 were offering lie detection based on functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. Using powerful magnets, these tools track the flow of blood to areas of the brain involved in social calculation, memory recall and impulse control.</p> <p>But just because a lie-detection tool seems technologically sophisticated doesn\u2019t mean it works. \u201cIt\u2019s quite simple to beat these tests in ways that are very difficult to detect by a potential investigator,\u201d said Dr Giorgio Ganis, who studies EEG and fMRI-based lie detection at the University of Plymouth. In 2007, a research group set up by the MacArthur Foundation examined fMRI-based deception tests. \u201cAfter looking at the literature, we concluded that we have no idea whether fMRI can or cannot detect lies,\u201d said Anthony Wagner, a Stanford psychologist and a member of the MacArthur group, who has testified against the admissibility of fMRI lie detection in court.</p> <p>A new frontier in lie detection is now emerging. An increasing number of projects are using AI to combine multiple sources of evidence into a single measure for deception. Machine learning is accelerating deception research by spotting previously unseen patterns in reams of data. Scientists at the University of Maryland, for example, have developed software that they claim can detect deception from courtroom footage with 88% accuracy.</p> <p>The algorithms behind such tools are designed to improve continuously over time, and may ultimately end up basing their determinations of guilt and innocence on factors that even the humans who have programmed them don\u2019t understand. These tests are being trialled in job interviews, at border crossings and in police interviews, but as they become increasingly widespread, civil rights groups and scientists are growing more and more concerned about the dangers they could unleash on society.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Nothing provides a clearer warning about the threats of the new generation of lie-detection than the history of the polygraph, the world\u2019s best-known and most widely used deception test. Although almost a century old, the machine still dominates both the public perception of lie detection and the testing market, with millions of polygraph tests conducted every year. Ever since its creation, it has been attacked for its questionable accuracy, and for the way it has been used as a tool of coercion. But the polygraph\u2019s flawed science continues to cast a shadow over lie detection technologies today.</p> <p>Even John Larson, the inventor of the polygraph, came to hate his creation. In 1921, Larson was a 29-year-old rookie police officer working the downtown beat in Berkeley, California. But he had also studied physiology and criminology and, when not on patrol, he was in a lab at the University of California, developing ways to bring science to bear in the fight against crime.</p> <p>In the spring of 1921, Larson built an ugly device that took continuous measurements of blood pressure and breathing rate, and scratched the results on to a rolling paper cylinder. He then devised an interview-based exam that compared a subject\u2019s physiological response when answering yes or no questions relating to a crime with the subject\u2019s answers to control questions such as \u201cIs your name Jane Doe?\u201d As a proof of concept, he used the test to solve a theft at a women\u2019s dormitory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c3d4d8541d47ce54a742d5919b0bbf8fbf49fa3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c3d4d8541d47ce54a742d5919b0bbf8fbf49fa3/0_118_4000_3101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Larson (right), the inventor of the polygraph lie detector.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"775\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Larson (right), the inventor of the polygraph lie detector.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Parade/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Larson refined his invention over several years with the help of an enterprising young man named Leonarde Keeler, who envisioned applications for the polygraph well beyond law enforcement. After the Wall Street crash of 1929, Keeler offered a version of the machine that was concealed inside an elegant walnut box to large organisations so they could screen employees suspected of theft.</p> <p>Not long after, the US government became the world\u2019s largest user of the exam. During the \u201cred scare\u201d of the 1950s, thousands of federal employees were subjected to polygraphs designed to root out communists. The US Army, which set up its first polygraph school in 1951, still trains examiners for all the intelligence agencies at the National Center for Credibility Assessment at Fort Jackson in South Carolina.</p> <p>Companies also embraced the technology. Throughout much of the last century, about a quarter of US corporations ran polygraph exams on employees to test for issues including histories of drug use and theft. McDonald\u2019s used to use the machine on its workers. By the 1980s, there were up to 10,000 trained polygraph examiners in the US, conducting 2m tests a year.</p> <p>The only problem was that the polygraph did not work. In 2003, the US National Academy of Sciences published a damning report that found evidence on the polygraph\u2019s accuracy across 57 studies was \u201cfar from satisfactory\u201d. History is littered with examples of known criminals who evaded detection by cheating the test. Aldrich Ames, a KGB double agent, passed two polygraphs while working for the CIA in the late 1980s and early 90s. With a little training, it is relatively easy to beat the machine. Floyd \u201cBuzz\u201d Fay, who was falsely convicted of murder in 1979 after a failed polygraph exam, became an expert in the test during his two-and-a-half-years in prison, and started coaching other inmates on how to defeat it. After 15 minutes of instruction, 23 of 27 were able to pass. Common \u201ccountermeasures\u201d, which work by exaggerating the body\u2019s response to control questions, include thinking about a frightening experience, stepping on a pin hidden in the shoe, or simply clenching the anus.</p> <p>The upshot is that the polygraph is not and never was an effective lie detector. There is no way for an examiner to know whether a rise in blood pressure is due to fear of getting caught in a lie, or anxiety about being wrongly accused. Different examiners rating the same charts can get contradictory results and there are huge discrepancies in outcome depending on location, race and gender. In one extreme example, an examiner in Washington state failed one in 20 law enforcement job applicants for having sex with animals; he \u201cuncovered\u201d 10 times more bestiality than his colleagues, and twice as much child pornography.</p> <p>As long ago as 1965, the year Larson died, the US Committee on Government Operations issued a damning verdict on the polygraph. \u201cPeople have been deceived by a myth that a metal box in the hands of an investigator can detect truth or falsehood,\u201d it concluded. By then, civil rights groups were arguing that the polygraph violated constitutional protections against self-incrimination. In fact, despite the polygraph\u2019s cultural status, in the US, its results are inadmissible in most courts. And in 1988, citing concerns that the polygraph was open to \u201cmisuse and abuse\u201d, the US Congress banned its use by employers. Other lie-detectors from the second half of the 20th century fared no better: abandoned Department of Defense projects included the \u201cwiggle chair\u201d, which covertly tracked movement and body temperature during interrogation, and an elaborate system for measuring breathing rate by aiming an infrared laser at the lip through a hole in the wall.</p> <p>The polygraph remained popular though \u2013 not because it was effective, but because people thought it was. \u201cThe people who developed the polygraph machine knew that the real power of it was in convincing people that it works,\u201d said Dr Andy Balmer, a sociologist at the University of Manchester who wrote a book called Lie Detection and the Law.</p> <p>The threat of being outed by the machine was enough to coerce some people into confessions. One examiner in Cincinnati in 1975 left the interrogation room and reportedly watched, bemused, through a two-way mirror as the accused tore 1.8 metres of paper charts off the machine and ate them. (You didn\u2019t even have to have the right machine: in the 1980s, police officers in Detroit extracted confessions by placing a suspect\u2019s hand on a photocopier that spat out sheets of paper with the phrase \u201cHe\u2019s Lying!\u201d pre-printed on them.) This was particularly attractive to law enforcement in the US, where it is vastly cheaper to use a machine to get a confession out of someone than it is to take them to trial.</p> <p>But other people were pushed to admit to crimes they did not commit after the machine wrongly labelled them as lying. The polygraph became a form of psychological torture that wrung false confessions from the vulnerable. Many of these people were then charged, prosecuted and sent to jail \u2013 whether by unscrupulous police and prosecutors, or by those who wrongly believed in the polygraph\u2019s power.</p> <p>Perhaps no one came to understand the coercive potential of his machine better than Larson. Shortly before his death in 1965, he wrote: \u201cBeyond my expectation, through uncontrollable factors, this scientific investigation became for practical purposes a Frankenstein\u2019s monster.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The search for a truly effective lie detector gained new urgency after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Several of the hijackers had managed to enter the US after successfully <a href=\"http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/staff_statement_1.pdf\" title=\"\">deceiving border agents</a>. Suddenly, intelligence and border services wanted tools that actually worked. A flood of new government funding made lie detection big business again. \u201cEverything changed after 9/11,\u201d writes psychologist Paul Ekman in Telling Lies.</p> <p>Ekman was one of the beneficiaries of this surge. In the 1970s, he had been filming interviews with psychiatric patients when he noticed a brief flash of despair cross the features of Mary, a 42-year-old suicidal woman, when she lied about feeling better. He spent the next few decades cataloguing how these tiny movements of the face, which he termed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/may/12/psychology-lying-microexpressions-paul-ekman\" title=\"\">micro-expressions</a>\u201d, can reveal hidden truths.</p> <p>Ekman\u2019s work was hugely influential with psychologists, and even served as the basis for Lie to Me, a primetime television show that debuted in 2009 with an Ekman-inspired lead played by Tim Roth. But it got its first real-world test in 2006, as part of a raft of new security measures introduced to combat terrorism. That year, Ekman spent a month teaching US immigration officers how to detect deception at passport control by looking for certain micro-expressions. The results are instructive: at least 16 terrorists were permitted to enter the US in the following six years.</p> <p>Investment in lie-detection technology \u201cgoes in waves\u201d, said Dr John Kircher, a University of Utah psychologist who developed a digital scoring system for the polygraph. There were spikes in the early 1980s, the mid-90s and the early 2000s, neatly tracking with Republican administrations and foreign wars. In 2008, under President George W Bush, the US Army spent $700,000 on 94 <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24015982/ns/world_news-terrorism/t/what-pcass-how-does-it-work/#.XW_GrW9Kj5U\" title=\"\">hand</a><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24015982/ns/world_news-terrorism/t/what-pcass-how-does-it-work/#.XW_GrW9Kj5U\" title=\"\">held lie detectors</a> for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Preliminary Credibility Assessment Screening System had three sensors that attached to the hand, connected to an off-the-shelf pager which flashed green for truth, red for lies and yellow if it couldn\u2019t decide. It was about as good as a photocopier at detecting deception \u2013 and at eliciting the truth.</p> <p>Some people believe an accurate lie detector would have allowed border patrol to stop the 9/11 hijackers. \u201cThese people were already on watch lists,\u201d Larry Farwell, the inventor of brain fingerprinting, told me. \u201cBrain fingerprinting could have provided the evidence we needed to bring the perpetrators to justice before they actually committed the crime.\u201d A similar logic has been applied in the case of European terrorists who returned from receiving training abroad.</p> <p>As a result, the frontline for much of the new government-funded lie detection technology has been the borders of the US and Europe. In 2014, travellers flying into Bucharest were interrogated by a <a href=\"https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/ua-developed-avatar-is-helping-to-screen-new-arrivals-at-bucharest-airport\" title=\"\">virtual border agent</a> called Avatar, an on-screen figure in a white shirt with blue eyes, which introduced itself as \u201cthe future of passport control\u201d. As well as an e-passport scanner and fingerprint reader, the Avatar unit has a microphone, an infra-red eye-tracking camera and an Xbox Kinect sensor to measure body movement. It is one of the first \u201cmulti-modal\u201d lie detectors \u2013 one that incorporates a number of different sources of evidence \u2013 since the polygraph.</p> <p>But the \u201csecret sauce\u201d, according to David Mackstaller, who is taking the technology in Avatar to market via a company called Discern Science, is in the software, which uses an algorithm to combine all of these types of data. The machine aims to send a verdict to a human border guard within 45 seconds, who can either wave the traveller through or pull them aside for additional screening. Mackstaller said he is in talks with governments \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t say which ones \u2013 about installing Avatar permanently after further tests at Nogales in Arizona on the US-Mexico border, and with federal employees at Reagan Airport near Washington DC. Discern Science claims accuracy rates in their preliminary studies \u2013 including the one in Bucharest \u2013 have been between 83% and 85%.</p> <p>The Bucharest trials were supported by Frontex, the EU border agency, which is now funding a competing system called iBorderCtrl, with its own virtual border guard. One aspect of iBorderCtrl is based on Silent Talker, a technology that has been in development at Manchester Metropolitan University since the early 2000s. Silent Talker uses an AI model to analyse more than 40 types of microgestures in the face and head; it only needs a camera and an internet connection to function. On a recent visit to the company\u2019s office in central Manchester, I watched video footage of a young man lying about taking money from a box during a mock crime experiment, while in the corner of the screen a dial swung from green, to yellow, to red. In theory, it could be run on a smartphone or used on live television footage, perhaps even during political debates, although co-founder James O\u2019Shea said the company doesn\u2019t want to go down that route \u2013 it is targeting law enforcement and insurance.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea and his colleague Zuhair Bandar claim Silent Talker has an accuracy rate of 75% in studies so far. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how it works,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. They stressed the importance of keeping a \u201chuman in the loop\u201d when it comes to making decisions based on Silent Talker\u2019s results.</p> <p>Mackstaller said Avatar\u2019s results will improve as its algorithm learns. He also expects it to perform better in the real world because the penalties for getting caught are much higher, so liars are under more stress. But research shows that the opposite may be true: lab studies tend to overestimate real-world success. </p> <p>Before these tools are rolled out at scale, clearer evidence is required that they work across different cultures, or with groups of people such as psychopaths, whose non-verbal behaviour may differ from the norm. Much of the research so far has been conducted on white Europeans and Americans. Evidence from other domains, including bail and prison sentencing, suggests that algorithms tend to encode the biases of the societies in which they are created. These effects could be heightened at the border, where some of society\u2019s greatest fears and prejudices play out. What\u2019s more, the black box of an AI model is not conducive to transparent decision making since it cannot explain its reasoning. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how it works,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cThe AI system learned how to do it by itself.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Balmer, the University of Manchester sociologist, fears that technology will be used to reinforce existing biases with a veneer of questionable science \u2013 making it harder for individuals from vulnerable groups to challenge decisions. \u201cMost reputable science is clear that lie detection doesn\u2019t work, and yet it persists as a field of study where other things probably would have been abandoned by now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat tells us something about what we want from it.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The truth has only one face, wrote the 16th-century French philosopher Michel de Montaigne, but a lie \u201chas a hundred thousand shapes and no defined limits\u201d. Deception is not a singular phenomenon and, as of yet, we know of no telltale sign of deception that holds true for everyone, in every situation. There is no Pinocchio\u2019s nose. \u201cThat\u2019s seen as the holy grail of lie detection,\u201d said Dr Sophie van der Zee, a legal psychologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. \u201cSo far no one has found it.\u201d</p> <p>The accuracy rates of 80-90% claimed by the likes of EyeDetect and Avatar sound impressive, but applied at the scale of a border crossing, they would lead to thousands of innocent people being wrongly flagged for every genuine threat it identified. It might also mean that two out of every 10 terrorists easily slips through.</p> <p>History suggests that such shortcomings will not stop these new tools from being used. After all, the polygraph has been widely debunked, but an estimated 2.5m polygraph exams are still conducted in the US every year. It is a $2.5bn industry. In the UK, the polygraph has been <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/compulsary-lie-detector-tests-for-serious-sex-offenders\" title=\"\">used on sex offenders</a> since 2014, and in January 2019, the government announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/21/domestic-abusers-may-face-lie-detector-tests-on-release-from-prison\" title=\"\">plans</a> to use it on domestic abusers on parole. The test \u201ccannot be killed by science because it was not born of science\u201d, writes the historian Ken Alder in his book The Lie Detectors.</p> <p>New technologies may be harder than the polygraph for unscrupulous examiners to deliberately manipulate, but that does not mean they will be fair. AI-powered lie detectors prey on the tendency of both individuals and governments to put faith in science\u2019s supposedly all-seeing eye. And the closer they get to perfect reliability, or at least the closer they appear to get, the more dangerous they will become, because lie detectors often get aimed at society\u2019s most vulnerable: women in the 1920s, suspected dissidents and homosexuals in the 60s, benefit claimants in the 2000s, asylum seekers and migrants today. \u201cScientists don\u2019t think much about who is going to use these methods,\u201d said Giorgio Ganis. \u201cI always feel that people should be aware of the implications.\u201d</p> <p>In an era of fake news and falsehoods, it can be tempting to look for certainty in science. But lie detectors tend to surface at \u201cpressure-cooker points\u201d in politics, when governments lower their requirements for scientific rigour, said Balmer. In this environment, dubious new techniques could \u201cslip neatly into the role the polygraph once played\u201d, Alder predicts.</p> <p>One day, improvements in artificial intelligence could find a reliable pattern for deception by scouring multiple sources of evidence, or more detailed scanning technologies could discover an unambiguous sign lurking in the brain. In the real world, however, practised falsehoods \u2013 the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, the lies that form the core of our identity \u2013 complicate matters. \u201cWe have this tremendous capacity to believe our own lies,\u201d Dan Ariely, a renowned behavioural psychologist at Duke University, said. \u201cAnd once we believe our own lies, of course we don\u2019t provide any signal of wrongdoing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/05/how-science-found-a-way-to-help-coma-patients-communicate\">How science found a way to help coma patients communicate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his 1995 science-fiction novel The Truth Machine, James Halperin imagined a world in which someone succeeds in building a perfect lie detector. The invention helps unite the warring nations of the globe into a world government, and accelerates the search for a cancer cure. But evidence from the last hundred years suggests that it probably wouldn\u2019t play out like that in real life. Politicians are hardly queueing up to use new technology on themselves. Terry Mullins, a long-time private polygraph examiner \u2013 one of about 30 in the UK \u2013 has been trying in vain to get police forces and government departments interested in the EyeDetect technology. \u201cYou can\u2019t get the government on board,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re all terrified.\u201d</p> <p>Daniel Langleben, the scientist behind No Lie MRI, told me one of the government agencies he was approached by was not really interested in the accuracy rates of his brain-based lie detector. An fMRI machine cannot be packed into a suitcase or brought into a police interrogation room. The investigator cannot manipulate the test results to apply pressure to an uncooperative suspect. The agency just wanted to know whether it could be used to train agents to beat the polygraph.</p> <p>\u201cTruth is not really a commodity,\u201d Langleben reflected. \u201cNobody wants it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We learn to lie as children, between the ages of two and five. By adulthood, we are prolific. We lie to our employers, our partners and, most of all, one study has found, to our mothers. The average person hears up to 200 lies a day, according to research by Jerry Jellison, a psychologist at the University of Southern California. The majority of the lies we tell are \u201cwhite\u201d, the inconsequential niceties \u2013 \u201cI love your dress!\u201d \u2013 that grease the wheels of human interaction. But most people tell one or two \u201cbig\u201d lies a day, says Richard Wiseman, a psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire. We lie to promote ourselves, protect ourselves and to hurt or avoid hurting others. The mystery is how we keep getting away with it. Our bodies expose us in every way. Hearts race, sweat drips and micro-expressions leak from small muscles in the face. We stutter, stall and make Freudian slips. \u201cNo mortal can keep a secret,\u201d wrote the psychoanalyst in 1905. \u201cIf his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips. Betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.\u201d Even so, we are hopeless at spotting deception. On average, across 206 scientific studies, people can separate truth from lies just 54% of the time \u2013 only marginally better than tossing a coin. \u201cPeople are bad at it because the differences between truth-tellers and liars are typically small and unreliable,\u201d said Aldert Vrij, a psychologist at the University of Portsmouth who has spent years studying ways to detect deception. Some people stiffen and freeze when put on the spot, others become more animated. Liars can spin yarns packed with colour and detail, and truth-tellers can seem vague and evasive. Humans have been trying to overcome this problem for millennia. The search for a perfect lie detector has involved torture, trials by ordeal and, in ancient India, an encounter with a donkey in a dark room. Three thousand years ago in China, the accused were forced to chew and spit out rice; the grains were thought to stick in the dry, nervous mouths of the guilty. In 1730, the English writer Daniel Defoe suggested taking the pulse of suspected pickpockets. \u201cGuilt carries fear always about with it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is a tremor in the blood of a thief.\u201d More recently, lie detection has largely been equated with the juddering styluses of the polygraph machine \u2013 the quintessential lie detector beloved by daytime television hosts and police procedurals. But none of these methods has yielded a reliable way to separate fiction from fact. That could soon change. In the past couple of decades, the rise of cheap computing power, brain-scanning technologies and artificial intelligence has given birth to what many claim is a powerful new generation of lie-detection tools. Startups, racing to commercialise these developments, want us to believe that a virtually infallible lie detector is just around the corner. Their inventions are being snapped up by police forces, state agencies and nations desperate to secure themselves against foreign threats. They are also being used by employers, insurance companies and welfare officers. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in interest from both the private sector and within government,\u201d said Todd Mickelsen, the CEO of Converus, which makes a lie detector based on eye movements and subtle changes in pupil size. Converus\u2019s technology, EyeDetect, has been used by FedEx in Panama and Uber in Mexico to screen out drivers with criminal histories, and by the credit ratings agency Experian, which tests its staff in Colombia to make sure they aren\u2019t manipulating the company\u2019s database to secure loans for family members. In the UK, Northumbria police are carrying out a pilot scheme that uses EyeDetect to measure the rehabilitation of sex offenders. Other EyeDetect customers include the government of Afghanistan, McDonald\u2019s and dozens of local police departments in the US. Soon, large-scale lie-detection programmes could be coming to the borders of the US and the European Union, where they would flag potentially deceptive travellers for further questioning. But as tools such as EyeDetect infiltrate more and more areas of public and private life, there are urgent questions to be answered about their scientific validity and ethical use. In our age of high surveillance and anxieties about all-powerful AIs, the idea that a machine could read our most personal thoughts feels more plausible than ever to us as individuals, and to the governments and corporations funding the new wave of lie-detection research. But what if states and employers come to believe in the power of a lie-detection technology that proves to be deeply biased \u2013 or that doesn\u2019t actually work? And what do we do with these technologies if they do succeed? A machine that reliably sorts truth from falsehood could have profound implications for human conduct. The creators of these tools argue that by weeding out deception they can create a fairer, safer world. But the ways lie detectors have been used in the past suggests such claims may be far too optimistic. * * * For most of us, most of the time, lying is more taxing and more stressful than honesty. To calculate another person\u2019s view, suppress emotions and hold back from blurting out the truth requires more thought and more energy than simply being honest. It demands that we bear what psychologists call a cognitive load. Carrying that burden, most lie-detection theories assume, leaves evidence in our bodies and actions. Lie-detection technologies tend to examine five different types of evidence. The first two are verbal: the things we say and the way we say them. Jeff Hancock, an expert on digital communication at Stanford, has found that people who are lying in their online dating profiles tend to use the words \u201cI\u201d, \u201cme\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d more often, for instance. Voice-stress analysis, which aims to detect deception based on changes in tone of voice, was used during the interrogation of George Zimmerman, who shot the teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, and by UK councils between 2007 and 2010 in a pilot scheme that tried to catch benefit cheats over the phone. Only five of the 23 local authorities where voice analysis was trialled judged it a success, but in 2014, it was still in use in 20 councils, according to freedom of information requests by the campaign group False Economy. The third source of evidence \u2013 body language \u2013 can also reveal hidden feelings. Some liars display so-called \u201cduper\u2019s delight\u201d, a fleeting expression of glee that crosses the face when they think they have got away with it. Cognitive load makes people move differently, and liars trying to \u201cact natural\u201d can end up doing the opposite. In an experiment in 2015, researchers at the University of Cambridge were able to detect deception more than 70% of the time by using a skintight suit to measure how much subjects fidgeted and froze under questioning. The fourth type of evidence is physiological. The polygraph measures blood pressure, breathing rate and sweat. Penile plethysmography tests arousal levels in sex offenders by measuring the engorgement of the penis using a special cuff. Infrared cameras analyse facial temperature. Unlike Pinocchio, our noses may actually shrink slightly when we lie as warm blood flows towards the brain. In the 1990s, new technologies opened up a fifth, ostensibly more direct avenue of investigation: the brain. In the second season of the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer, Steven Avery, who is serving a life sentence for a brutal killing he says he did not commit, undergoes a \u201cbrain fingerprinting\u201d exam, which uses an electrode-studded headset called an electroencephalogram, or EEG, to read his neural activity and translate it into waves rising and falling on a graph. The test\u2019s inventor, Dr Larry Farwell, claims it can detect knowledge of a crime hidden in a suspect\u2019s brain by picking up a neural response to phrases or pictures relating to the crime that only the perpetrator and investigators would recognise. Another EEG-based test was used in 2008 to convict a 24-year-old Indian woman named Aditi Sharma of murdering her fiance by lacing his food with arsenic, but Sharma\u2019s sentence was eventually overturned on appeal when the Indian supreme court held that the test could violate the subject\u2019s rights against self-incrimination. After 9/11, the US government \u2013 long an enthusiastic sponsor of deception science \u2013 started funding other kinds of brain-based lie-detection work through Darpa, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency. By 2006, two companies \u2013 Cephos and No Lie MRI \u2013 were offering lie detection based on functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. Using powerful magnets, these tools track the flow of blood to areas of the brain involved in social calculation, memory recall and impulse control. But just because a lie-detection tool seems technologically sophisticated doesn\u2019t mean it works. \u201cIt\u2019s quite simple to beat these tests in ways that are very difficult to detect by a potential investigator,\u201d said Dr Giorgio Ganis, who studies EEG and fMRI-based lie detection at the University of Plymouth. In 2007, a research group set up by the MacArthur Foundation examined fMRI-based deception tests. \u201cAfter looking at the literature, we concluded that we have no idea whether fMRI can or cannot detect lies,\u201d said Anthony Wagner, a Stanford psychologist and a member of the MacArthur group, who has testified against the admissibility of fMRI lie detection in court. A new frontier in lie detection is now emerging. An increasing number of projects are using AI to combine multiple sources of evidence into a single measure for deception. Machine learning is accelerating deception research by spotting previously unseen patterns in reams of data. Scientists at the University of Maryland, for example, have developed software that they claim can detect deception from courtroom footage with 88% accuracy. The algorithms behind such tools are designed to improve continuously over time, and may ultimately end up basing their determinations of guilt and innocence on factors that even the humans who have programmed them don\u2019t understand. These tests are being trialled in job interviews, at border crossings and in police interviews, but as they become increasingly widespread, civil rights groups and scientists are growing more and more concerned about the dangers they could unleash on society. * * * Nothing provides a clearer warning about the threats of the new generation of lie-detection than the history of the polygraph, the world\u2019s best-known and most widely used deception test. Although almost a century old, the machine still dominates both the public perception of lie detection and the testing market, with millions of polygraph tests conducted every year. Ever since its creation, it has been attacked for its questionable accuracy, and for the way it has been used as a tool of coercion. But the polygraph\u2019s flawed science continues to cast a shadow over lie detection technologies today. Even John Larson, the inventor of the polygraph, came to hate his creation. In 1921, Larson was a 29-year-old rookie police officer working the downtown beat in Berkeley, California. But he had also studied physiology and criminology and, when not on patrol, he was in a lab at the University of California, developing ways to bring science to bear in the fight against crime. In the spring of 1921, Larson built an ugly device that took continuous measurements of blood pressure and breathing rate, and scratched the results on to a rolling paper cylinder. He then devised an interview-based exam that compared a subject\u2019s physiological response when answering yes or no questions relating to a crime with the subject\u2019s answers to control questions such as \u201cIs your name Jane Doe?\u201d As a proof of concept, he used the test to solve a theft at a women\u2019s dormitory. Larson refined his invention over several years with the help of an enterprising young man named Leonarde Keeler, who envisioned applications for the polygraph well beyond law enforcement. After the Wall Street crash of 1929, Keeler offered a version of the machine that was concealed inside an elegant walnut box to large organisations so they could screen employees suspected of theft. Not long after, the US government became the world\u2019s largest user of the exam. During the \u201cred scare\u201d of the 1950s, thousands of federal employees were subjected to polygraphs designed to root out communists. The US Army, which set up its first polygraph school in 1951, still trains examiners for all the intelligence agencies at the National Center for Credibility Assessment at Fort Jackson in South Carolina. Companies also embraced the technology. Throughout much of the last century, about a quarter of US corporations ran polygraph exams on employees to test for issues including histories of drug use and theft. McDonald\u2019s used to use the machine on its workers. By the 1980s, there were up to 10,000 trained polygraph examiners in the US, conducting 2m tests a year. The only problem was that the polygraph did not work. In 2003, the US National Academy of Sciences published a damning report that found evidence on the polygraph\u2019s accuracy across 57 studies was \u201cfar from satisfactory\u201d. History is littered with examples of known criminals who evaded detection by cheating the test. Aldrich Ames, a KGB double agent, passed two polygraphs while working for the CIA in the late 1980s and early 90s. With a little training, it is relatively easy to beat the machine. Floyd \u201cBuzz\u201d Fay, who was falsely convicted of murder in 1979 after a failed polygraph exam, became an expert in the test during his two-and-a-half-years in prison, and started coaching other inmates on how to defeat it. After 15 minutes of instruction, 23 of 27 were able to pass. Common \u201ccountermeasures\u201d, which work by exaggerating the body\u2019s response to control questions, include thinking about a frightening experience, stepping on a pin hidden in the shoe, or simply clenching the anus. The upshot is that the polygraph is not and never was an effective lie detector. There is no way for an examiner to know whether a rise in blood pressure is due to fear of getting caught in a lie, or anxiety about being wrongly accused. Different examiners rating the same charts can get contradictory results and there are huge discrepancies in outcome depending on location, race and gender. In one extreme example, an examiner in Washington state failed one in 20 law enforcement job applicants for having sex with animals; he \u201cuncovered\u201d 10 times more bestiality than his colleagues, and twice as much child pornography. As long ago as 1965, the year Larson died, the US Committee on Government Operations issued a damning verdict on the polygraph. \u201cPeople have been deceived by a myth that a metal box in the hands of an investigator can detect truth or falsehood,\u201d it concluded. By then, civil rights groups were arguing that the polygraph violated constitutional protections against self-incrimination. In fact, despite the polygraph\u2019s cultural status, in the US, its results are inadmissible in most courts. And in 1988, citing concerns that the polygraph was open to \u201cmisuse and abuse\u201d, the US Congress banned its use by employers. Other lie-detectors from the second half of the 20th century fared no better: abandoned Department of Defense projects included the \u201cwiggle chair\u201d, which covertly tracked movement and body temperature during interrogation, and an elaborate system for measuring breathing rate by aiming an infrared laser at the lip through a hole in the wall. The polygraph remained popular though \u2013 not because it was effective, but because people thought it was. \u201cThe people who developed the polygraph machine knew that the real power of it was in convincing people that it works,\u201d said Dr Andy Balmer, a sociologist at the University of Manchester who wrote a book called Lie Detection and the Law. The threat of being outed by the machine was enough to coerce some people into confessions. One examiner in Cincinnati in 1975 left the interrogation room and reportedly watched, bemused, through a two-way mirror as the accused tore 1.8 metres of paper charts off the machine and ate them. (You didn\u2019t even have to have the right machine: in the 1980s, police officers in Detroit extracted confessions by placing a suspect\u2019s hand on a photocopier that spat out sheets of paper with the phrase \u201cHe\u2019s Lying!\u201d pre-printed on them.) This was particularly attractive to law enforcement in the US, where it is vastly cheaper to use a machine to get a confession out of someone than it is to take them to trial. But other people were pushed to admit to crimes they did not commit after the machine wrongly labelled them as lying. The polygraph became a form of psychological torture that wrung false confessions from the vulnerable. Many of these people were then charged, prosecuted and sent to jail \u2013 whether by unscrupulous police and prosecutors, or by those who wrongly believed in the polygraph\u2019s power. Perhaps no one came to understand the coercive potential of his machine better than Larson. Shortly before his death in 1965, he wrote: \u201cBeyond my expectation, through uncontrollable factors, this scientific investigation became for practical purposes a Frankenstein\u2019s monster.\u201d * * * The search for a truly effective lie detector gained new urgency after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Several of the hijackers had managed to enter the US after successfully deceiving border agents. Suddenly, intelligence and border services wanted tools that actually worked. A flood of new government funding made lie detection big business again. \u201cEverything changed after 9/11,\u201d writes psychologist Paul Ekman in Telling Lies. Ekman was one of the beneficiaries of this surge. In the 1970s, he had been filming interviews with psychiatric patients when he noticed a brief flash of despair cross the features of Mary, a 42-year-old suicidal woman, when she lied about feeling better. He spent the next few decades cataloguing how these tiny movements of the face, which he termed \u201cmicro-expressions\u201d, can reveal hidden truths. Ekman\u2019s work was hugely influential with psychologists, and even served as the basis for Lie to Me, a primetime television show that debuted in 2009 with an Ekman-inspired lead played by Tim Roth. But it got its first real-world test in 2006, as part of a raft of new security measures introduced to combat terrorism. That year, Ekman spent a month teaching US immigration officers how to detect deception at passport control by looking for certain micro-expressions. The results are instructive: at least 16 terrorists were permitted to enter the US in the following six years. Investment in lie-detection technology \u201cgoes in waves\u201d, said Dr John Kircher, a University of Utah psychologist who developed a digital scoring system for the polygraph. There were spikes in the early 1980s, the mid-90s and the early 2000s, neatly tracking with Republican administrations and foreign wars. In 2008, under President George W Bush, the US Army spent $700,000 on 94 handheld lie detectors for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Preliminary Credibility Assessment Screening System had three sensors that attached to the hand, connected to an off-the-shelf pager which flashed green for truth, red for lies and yellow if it couldn\u2019t decide. It was about as good as a photocopier at detecting deception \u2013 and at eliciting the truth. Some people believe an accurate lie detector would have allowed border patrol to stop the 9/11 hijackers. \u201cThese people were already on watch lists,\u201d Larry Farwell, the inventor of brain fingerprinting, told me. \u201cBrain fingerprinting could have provided the evidence we needed to bring the perpetrators to justice before they actually committed the crime.\u201d A similar logic has been applied in the case of European terrorists who returned from receiving training abroad. As a result, the frontline for much of the new government-funded lie detection technology has been the borders of the US and Europe. In 2014, travellers flying into Bucharest were interrogated by a virtual border agent called Avatar, an on-screen figure in a white shirt with blue eyes, which introduced itself as \u201cthe future of passport control\u201d. As well as an e-passport scanner and fingerprint reader, the Avatar unit has a microphone, an infra-red eye-tracking camera and an Xbox Kinect sensor to measure body movement. It is one of the first \u201cmulti-modal\u201d lie detectors \u2013 one that incorporates a number of different sources of evidence \u2013 since the polygraph. But the \u201csecret sauce\u201d, according to David Mackstaller, who is taking the technology in Avatar to market via a company called Discern Science, is in the software, which uses an algorithm to combine all of these types of data. The machine aims to send a verdict to a human border guard within 45 seconds, who can either wave the traveller through or pull them aside for additional screening. Mackstaller said he is in talks with governments \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t say which ones \u2013 about installing Avatar permanently after further tests at Nogales in Arizona on the US-Mexico border, and with federal employees at Reagan Airport near Washington DC. Discern Science claims accuracy rates in their preliminary studies \u2013 including the one in Bucharest \u2013 have been between 83% and 85%. The Bucharest trials were supported by Frontex, the EU border agency, which is now funding a competing system called iBorderCtrl, with its own virtual border guard. One aspect of iBorderCtrl is based on Silent Talker, a technology that has been in development at Manchester Metropolitan University since the early 2000s. Silent Talker uses an AI model to analyse more than 40 types of microgestures in the face and head; it only needs a camera and an internet connection to function. On a recent visit to the company\u2019s office in central Manchester, I watched video footage of a young man lying about taking money from a box during a mock crime experiment, while in the corner of the screen a dial swung from green, to yellow, to red. In theory, it could be run on a smartphone or used on live television footage, perhaps even during political debates, although co-founder James O\u2019Shea said the company doesn\u2019t want to go down that route \u2013 it is targeting law enforcement and insurance. O\u2019Shea and his colleague Zuhair Bandar claim Silent Talker has an accuracy rate of 75% in studies so far. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how it works,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. They stressed the importance of keeping a \u201chuman in the loop\u201d when it comes to making decisions based on Silent Talker\u2019s results. Mackstaller said Avatar\u2019s results will improve as its algorithm learns. He also expects it to perform better in the real world because the penalties for getting caught are much higher, so liars are under more stress. But research shows that the opposite may be true: lab studies tend to overestimate real-world success. Before these tools are rolled out at scale, clearer evidence is required that they work across different cultures, or with groups of people such as psychopaths, whose non-verbal behaviour may differ from the norm. Much of the research so far has been conducted on white Europeans and Americans. Evidence from other domains, including bail and prison sentencing, suggests that algorithms tend to encode the biases of the societies in which they are created. These effects could be heightened at the border, where some of society\u2019s greatest fears and prejudices play out. What\u2019s more, the black box of an AI model is not conducive to transparent decision making since it cannot explain its reasoning. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how it works,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cThe AI system learned how to do it by itself.\u201d Andy Balmer, the University of Manchester sociologist, fears that technology will be used to reinforce existing biases with a veneer of questionable science \u2013 making it harder for individuals from vulnerable groups to challenge decisions. \u201cMost reputable science is clear that lie detection doesn\u2019t work, and yet it persists as a field of study where other things probably would have been abandoned by now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat tells us something about what we want from it.\u201d * * * The truth has only one face, wrote the 16th-century French philosopher Michel de Montaigne, but a lie \u201chas a hundred thousand shapes and no defined limits\u201d. Deception is not a singular phenomenon and, as of yet, we know of no telltale sign of deception that holds true for everyone, in every situation. There is no Pinocchio\u2019s nose. \u201cThat\u2019s seen as the holy grail of lie detection,\u201d said Dr Sophie van der Zee, a legal psychologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. \u201cSo far no one has found it.\u201d The accuracy rates of 80-90% claimed by the likes of EyeDetect and Avatar sound impressive, but applied at the scale of a border crossing, they would lead to thousands of innocent people being wrongly flagged for every genuine threat it identified. It might also mean that two out of every 10 terrorists easily slips through. History suggests that such shortcomings will not stop these new tools from being used. After all, the polygraph has been widely debunked, but an estimated 2.5m polygraph exams are still conducted in the US every year. It is a $2.5bn industry. In the UK, the polygraph has been used on sex offenders since 2014, and in January 2019, the government announced plans to use it on domestic abusers on parole. The test \u201ccannot be killed by science because it was not born of science\u201d, writes the historian Ken Alder in his book The Lie Detectors. New technologies may be harder than the polygraph for unscrupulous examiners to deliberately manipulate, but that does not mean they will be fair. AI-powered lie detectors prey on the tendency of both individuals and governments to put faith in science\u2019s supposedly all-seeing eye. And the closer they get to perfect reliability, or at least the closer they appear to get, the more dangerous they will become, because lie detectors often get aimed at society\u2019s most vulnerable: women in the 1920s, suspected dissidents and homosexuals in the 60s, benefit claimants in the 2000s, asylum seekers and migrants today. \u201cScientists don\u2019t think much about who is going to use these methods,\u201d said Giorgio Ganis. \u201cI always feel that people should be aware of the implications.\u201d In an era of fake news and falsehoods, it can be tempting to look for certainty in science. But lie detectors tend to surface at \u201cpressure-cooker points\u201d in politics, when governments lower their requirements for scientific rigour, said Balmer. In this environment, dubious new techniques could \u201cslip neatly into the role the polygraph once played\u201d, Alder predicts. One day, improvements in artificial intelligence could find a reliable pattern for deception by scouring multiple sources of evidence, or more detailed scanning technologies could discover an unambiguous sign lurking in the brain. In the real world, however, practised falsehoods \u2013 the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, the lies that form the core of our identity \u2013 complicate matters. \u201cWe have this tremendous capacity to believe our own lies,\u201d Dan Ariely, a renowned behavioural psychologist at Duke University, said. \u201cAnd once we believe our own lies, of course we don\u2019t provide any signal of wrongdoing.\u201d In his 1995 science-fiction novel The Truth Machine, James Halperin imagined a world in which someone succeeds in building a perfect lie detector. The invention helps unite the warring nations of the globe into a world government, and accelerates the search for a cancer cure. But evidence from the last hundred years suggests that it probably wouldn\u2019t play out like that in real life. Politicians are hardly queueing up to use new technology on themselves. Terry Mullins, a long-time private polygraph examiner \u2013 one of about 30 in the UK \u2013 has been trying in vain to get police forces and government departments interested in the EyeDetect technology. \u201cYou can\u2019t get the government on board,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re all terrified.\u201d Daniel Langleben, the scientist behind No Lie MRI, told me one of the government agencies he was approached by was not really interested in the accuracy rates of his brain-based lie detector. An fMRI machine cannot be packed into a suitcase or brought into a police interrogation room. The investigator cannot manipulate the test results to apply pressure to an uncooperative suspect. The agency just wanted to know whether it could be used to train agents to beat the polygraph. \u201cTruth is not really a commodity,\u201d Langleben reflected. \u201cNobody wants it.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

Ali Catterall Billy Connolly\u2019s Great American Trail 9pm, ITV You always instantly forgive the Big Yin every time he comes up with yet another spurious excuse for a TV jaunt across the US. Why? He\u2019s such good company. This three-part travelogue follows him on the 3,000-mile trail of early Scottish migrants from Massachusetts to Tennessee. MB Lost Films of WW2 9pm, BBC Four A history doc with a singularly intimate perspective, this two-parter views events of the second world war through home movie footage, much of it in colour, captured on early cine cameras. It\u2019s full of astonishing scenes, from Home Guard training sessions to film of the twisted ruins of Sheffield city centre. MB Film choice Men in Black (Barry Sonnenfeld, 1997), 8pm, E4 The first, very funny chapter of the sci-fi spoof in which the world is full of aliens living incognito and interstellar government agents are keeping an eye on them. It\u2019s the reactions to the array of space beasts that give the film its comic buzz: Tommy Lee Jones maintains a seen-it-all-before expression; Will Smith is all wide-eyed incredulity.

      "body": "<p>It is 14 July 2017. Donald Trump is guest of honour at the annual Bastille Day celebrations in Paris \u2013 a double whammy that year, marking the centenary of America\u2019s entry into the first world war. Emmanuel Macron and the French <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/14/macron-pulls-out-all-stops-bastille-day-parade-trump-france\">weren\u2019t stinting</a> \u2013 there was pomp, ceremony and lavish military displays, not to mention handshakes between the two new presidents. Handshakes that went on and on \u2026 and on, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/28/emmanuel-macron-my-handshake-with-trump-was-a-moment-of-truth\">like some bizarre courtship ritual</a>, simultaneously friendly and mildly aggressive.</p> <p>But as they primped and preened and smirked and backslapped, my eyes were drawn not to the men but to the two women standing, somewhat awkwardly, either side of them trying to smile. The wives. Brigitte Macron, the former schoolteacher who, it was noted relentlessly at the time, is 25 years older than her husband, and Melania Trump, the ex-model from Slovenia who, it is much less noted, is 24 years younger than her<em> </em>husband. Brigitte, it was widely reported, was the rock of strength with whose support, encouragement and, indeed, rumoured coaching, Macron had built his movement La R\u00e9publique en Marche, beating the far right Marine Le Pen. Melania, it was generally gossiped, just wanted to run for the hills.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61f5a4ccc8b21c7e7ac1718a8ea00e448283d5ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61f5a4ccc8b21c7e7ac1718a8ea00e448283d5ca/0_0_3729_2486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Embarrassed or exhilarated?

Were they embarrassed? Exhilarated? Bored? These silent women, whose only means of communicating at such events is generally what or who they\u2019re wearing \u2013 what do they say to one another when the doors close and the cameras depart? And what\u2019s it like to be in such close proximity to power but not \u2013 in the direct sense at least \u2013 to have power yourself?</p> <p>These questions were the seeds of my play Two Ladies, soon to open at the Bridge theatre in London, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/zoe-wanamaker\">Zo\u00eb Wanamaker</a> and Zrinka Cvite\u0161i\u0107 and directed by Nicholas Hytner. The play presents an alternative reality involving a heightened global crisis. The two ladies in question are fictional characters, but admittedly share similarities with certain real-life ones. Wanamaker plays the English wife of a fictional French president, while Cvite\u0161i\u0107 plays the Croatian wife of a fictional American one. Both bring their considerable theatrical abilities and cultural backgrounds to roles that present two first ladies in a high-stakes situation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a805b4e9f14d69a5bcc5f59729ce0cbb169bba6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a805b4e9f14d69a5bcc5f59729ce0cbb169bba6e/0_0_5407_3605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zrinka Cvite\u0161i\u0107 and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker in Two Ladies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">High-stakes situation \u2026 Zrinka Cvite\u0161i\u0107 and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker in Two Ladies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Maybanks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Playwrights tend to look for gaps. The best stories are often found in that space where the real world meets the unruly underworld of our imaginations. Watching Brigitte and Melania that day, I began thinking of the women of Greek mythology: Helen of Troy, whose famed beauty supposedly sparked the Trojan war; and Iphigenia, sacrificed at the hands of her father so the winds could change and the Greeks could sail for Troy. These mythic women were so often the catalysts for the action of Homeric epic poetry, but banished to the sidelines of the action itself. (Except for Penelope in The Odyssey who, thrillingly, gets to wait.)</p> <p>Had you asked me three years ago if I had a particularly avid interest in writing about first ladies, I might have laughed. In this era of third-wave feminism and #MeToo, when Angela Merkel and Jacinda Ardern and, yes, alright, Theresa May have proven that women can and do make it to the top jobs in politics, why should any of us care about the wives? What even is the point of a presidential spouse, other than to be married to the president? And anyway, hasn\u2019t the role changed with the times? In Ireland, where I\u2019m from, our Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has a boyfriend, Matthew Barrett. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/01/why-carrie-symonds-is-the-embodiment-of-the-boris-johnson-brand\">Carrie Symonds</a> has become Downing Street\u2019s \u201cfirst girlfriend\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0bbadcab75cf3454ae6486605101a5ebb52fba1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bbadcab75cf3454ae6486605101a5ebb52fba1a/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel amidst a throng of male world leaders at the G7 summit in Biarritz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Balance of power \u2026 Angela Merkel amid a throng of male world leaders at the G7 summit in Biarritz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Langsdon/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roles are evolving, things are moving on \u2026 but then up pop photographs like those from the G7 summit in August, where Angela Merkel is the only woman amid a throng of male world leaders. Or last June\u2019s G20, where presidential spouses are lined up like expensively dressed schoolchildren and Philip May is the only man. And we realise that actually, shockingly, not much has changed at all. The role of presidential partner is still primarily a female one, and the balance of world power is overwhelmingly in the hands of men.</p> <p>But what of the role itself? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/12/ladybirdjohnsonslegacy\">Lady Bird Johnson</a> famously described the first lady as \u201can unpaid public servant elected by one person, her husband\u201d. In the US, where her popularity plays a role in his, the president\u2019s spouse tends to serve as part of the administration, with her own offices and her own staff. She hosts state dinners and has official duties. But in other countries, the position is far less well defined. In France, for instance, Macron introduced a \u201ctransparency charter\u201d to clarify the role of presidential spouse \u2013 and the amount of public money being spent on her. But his reported intention to give his wife a budget, salary and official title was met with derision, outrage and a petition of protest signed by almost 300,000 people. He backed away. The French were adamant they did not want an official <em>premi\u00e8re dame.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd796aea58f01814ab9c300909d905f4a2b377c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd796aea58f01814ab9c300909d905f4a2b377c3/0_325_2398_2675/896.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Bird and Lyndon Johnson in 1955.\" width=\"896\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady Bird and Lyndon Johnson in 1955.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This reveals a larger issue: the suspicion with which we treat a presidential spouse if they appear to be angling for more power than deemed appropriate. Having access to those in power means being able to exert influence. Exerting influence when you haven\u2019t been elected is dangerous to a democracy. And who is better placed to wield undue influence than the person sharing the president\u2019s bed?</p> <p>But is proximity to power a red herring? What about the cost? Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton gave up highly accomplished, professional careers to take on the unpaid role of first lady, with all the scrutiny it entails. Each has talked about the \u201cprivilege\u201d and \u201chonour\u201d of serving their country. But wasn\u2019t it also a sacrifice? And a painful one at that? Would they tell us if it was? And once their husbands were elected, what choice did they really have? How can we ever know the true personal cost to these women of supporting their husbands politically, when all we ever really see is what their spin doctors, speech writers and carefully crafted memoirs want us to?</p> <p>Which brings us back to mythology. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s a stretch to compare Melania Trump to Helen of Troy or Cherie Blair to Iphigenia, but in a general sense, I feel there is some truth in it. It took the tragedians of fifth-century BC Athens to give voice to the women of Greek mythology.

      "bodyText": "It is 14 July 2017. Donald Trump is guest of honour at the annual Bastille Day celebrations in Paris \u2013 a double whammy that year, marking the centenary of America\u2019s entry into the first world war. Emmanuel Macron and the French weren\u2019t stinting \u2013 there was pomp, ceremony and lavish military displays, not to mention handshakes between the two new presidents. Handshakes that went on and on \u2026 and on, like some bizarre courtship ritual, simultaneously friendly and mildly aggressive. But as they primped and preened and smirked and backslapped, my eyes were drawn not to the men but to the two women standing, somewhat awkwardly, either side of them trying to smile. The wives. Brigitte Macron, the former schoolteacher who, it was noted relentlessly at the time, is 25 years older than her husband, and Melania Trump, the ex-model from Slovenia who, it is much less noted, is 24 years younger than her husband. Brigitte, it was widely reported, was the rock of strength with whose support, encouragement and, indeed, rumoured coaching, Macron had built his movement La R\u00e9publique en Marche, beating the far right Marine Le Pen. Melania, it was generally gossiped, just wanted to run for the hills. \u201cWhat do they make of all this, really?\u201d I wondered, as I watched the women glance and smile at one another, something polite but strained in their interactions. Were they embarrassed? Exhilarated? Bored? These silent women, whose only means of communicating at such events is generally what or who they\u2019re wearing \u2013 what do they say to one another when the doors close and the cameras depart? And what\u2019s it like to be in such close proximity to power but not \u2013 in the direct sense at least \u2013 to have power yourself? These questions were the seeds of my play Two Ladies, soon to open at the Bridge theatre in London, starring Zo\u00eb Wanamaker and Zrinka Cvite\u0161i\u0107 and directed by Nicholas Hytner. The play presents an alternative reality involving a heightened global crisis. The two ladies in question are fictional characters, but admittedly share similarities with certain real-life ones. Wanamaker plays the English wife of a fictional French president, while Cvite\u0161i\u0107 plays the Croatian wife of a fictional American one. Both bring their considerable theatrical abilities and cultural backgrounds to roles that present two first ladies in a high-stakes situation. Playwrights tend to look for gaps. The best stories are often found in that space where the real world meets the unruly underworld of our imaginations. Watching Brigitte and Melania that day, I began thinking of the women of Greek mythology: Helen of Troy, whose famed beauty supposedly sparked the Trojan war; and Iphigenia, sacrificed at the hands of her father so the winds could change and the Greeks could sail for Troy. These mythic women were so often the catalysts for the action of Homeric epic poetry, but banished to the sidelines of the action itself. (Except for Penelope in The Odyssey who, thrillingly, gets to wait.) Had you asked me three years ago if I had a particularly avid interest in writing about first ladies, I might have laughed. In this era of third-wave feminism and #MeToo, when Angela Merkel and Jacinda Ardern and, yes, alright, Theresa May have proven that women can and do make it to the top jobs in politics, why should any of us care about the wives? What even is the point of a presidential spouse, other than to be married to the president? And anyway, hasn\u2019t the role changed with the times? In Ireland, where I\u2019m from, our Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has a boyfriend, Matthew Barrett. In the UK, Carrie Symonds has become Downing Street\u2019s \u201cfirst girlfriend\u201d. Roles are evolving, things are moving on \u2026 but then up pop photographs like those from the G7 summit in August, where Angela Merkel is the only woman amid a throng of male world leaders. Or last June\u2019s G20, where presidential spouses are lined up like expensively dressed schoolchildren and Philip May is the only man. And we realise that actually, shockingly, not much has changed at all. The role of presidential partner is still primarily a female one, and the balance of world power is overwhelmingly in the hands of men. But what of the role itself? Lady Bird Johnson famously described the first lady as \u201can unpaid public servant elected by one person, her husband\u201d. In the US, where her popularity plays a role in his, the president\u2019s spouse tends to serve as part of the administration, with her own offices and her own staff. She hosts state dinners and has official duties. But in other countries, the position is far less well defined. In France, for instance, Macron introduced a \u201ctransparency charter\u201d to clarify the role of presidential spouse \u2013 and the amount of public money being spent on her. But his reported intention to give his wife a budget, salary and official title was met with derision, outrage and a petition of protest signed by almost 300,000 people. He backed away. The French were adamant they did not want an official premi\u00e8re dame. This reveals a larger issue: the suspicion with which we treat a presidential spouse if they appear to be angling for more power than deemed appropriate. Having access to those in power means being able to exert influence. Exerting influence when you haven\u2019t been elected is dangerous to a democracy. And who is better placed to wield undue influence than the person sharing the president\u2019s bed? But is proximity to power a red herring? What about the cost? Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton gave up highly accomplished, professional careers to take on the unpaid role of first lady, with all the scrutiny it entails. Each has talked about the \u201cprivilege\u201d and \u201chonour\u201d of serving their country. But wasn\u2019t it also a sacrifice? And a painful one at that? Would they tell us if it was? And once their husbands were elected, what choice did they really have? How can we ever know the true personal cost to these women of supporting their husbands politically, when all we ever really see is what their spin doctors, speech writers and carefully crafted memoirs want us to? Which brings us back to mythology. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s a stretch to compare Melania Trump to Helen of Troy or Cherie Blair to Iphigenia, but in a general sense, I feel there is some truth in it. It took the tragedians of fifth-century BC Athens to give voice to the women of Greek mythology. Without sounding grandiose, or worse absurd, I wondered if it was worth exploring something similar with first ladies. After all, is there not something mythic about these women whom we watch on the world stage but never truly know? And if they did get to speak, might they be able to bring us a new kind of political \u2013 and personal \u2013 story, that resonates with our times? Two Ladies is at the Bridge theatre, London, from 14 September until 26 October.",

But Cummings was close to like-minded female members of the Gove set, including the free schools champion Rachel Wolf (married to his old friend, the lobbyist James Frayne) and the adviser Elena Narozanski, now back in No 10 advising on education; he also rated civil servant Victoria Woodcock highly enough to recruit her as Vote Leave\u2019s director of operations, arguing subsequently that, without her, they might not have won.</p> <p>\u201cOf all the accusations you could hurl at him, being a sexist is actually the least of it,\u201d says Gisela Stuart, the former Labour MP who chaired Vote Leave. \u201cWith Dom, you deliver or you don\u2019t deliver; things are good if you do, and not good if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Nor has there ever been a whiff of personal sleaze around Cummings, by all accounts happily married to the journalist Mary Wakefield.

      "bodyText": "Sonia Khan seemed exactly the kind of young woman likely to prosper under Boris Johnson. A passionate Brexiter who cut her political teeth campaigning for lower taxes, at 27 she was already a veteran of several Whitehall departments, including the Treasury. When he became chancellor, Sajid Javid snapped her up. Then, last week, her career ended in the most brutal of ways; escorted out of No 10 by the police, after being summarily sacked by prime ministerial adviser Dominic Cummings in a manner that her former boss Philip Hammond suggested could win her an employment tribunal case should she choose to bring one. Worse still, Khan, whose loyalties were seemingly questioned because of her contacts with old friends in the rebellious Hammond\u2019s camp, was the fourth female aide forced out by the new regime. \u201cHow someone could think that escorting a young Asian woman out with an armed police officer was good optics beggars belief,\u201d says a female former Tory staffer. She points out that the idea of what one anonymous Tory source called \u201cbig thuggy bald blokes picking on girls\u201d is a gift to opposition MPs busy painting Johnson\u2019s wider regime as aggressive, unreconstructed and full of dubious attitudes to women. Johnson appearing to call the leader of the opposition a \u201cbig girl\u2019s blouse\u201d in his first Prime Minister\u2019s Questions on Wednesday does nothing to improve this image \u2013 nor did Cummings\u2019 behaviour on Tuesday night, after a vote to wrest control of parliamentary proceedings \u2013 widely seen as a humiliating defeat for his strategy \u2013 ended with a reportedly boisterous chance encounter between him and Jeremy Corbyn as the latter left for the night. The Labour frontbencher Cat Smith, who was with Corbyn, tweeted that at first she just thought there was \u201csome loud bloke who stunk of booze yelling at us\u201d. But in an era where behavioural norms and political conventions are being rewritten overnight, the question is whether the charge \u2013 fair or unfair \u2013 of having a \u201cwoman problem\u201d still carries an electoral price for Tory leaders. Will it matter at the ballot boxes that Johnson scrapped an inquiry ordered by Theresa May into Mark Field, the Tory MP filmed manhandling a female protester out of a smart City dinner? Do potential Tory voters care that he compared women wearing burqas to letterboxes, or once suggested the best way to deal with a female colleague\u2019s advice was to \u201cpat her on the bottom and send her on her way\u201d? When David Cameron told the Labour MP Angela Eagle to \u201cCalm down, dear\u201d in the Commons, the accusations of sexism lasted for days. But have the goalposts changed, in an era now so polarised that Donald Trump can seemingly dismiss an allegation of rape \u2013 levelled in the journalist E Jean Carroll\u2019s memoirs \u2013 and watch the news cycle move on? He may now be cast as the cartoon villain of this administration, but when Cummings began work in 2002 for the then Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, fear was arguably the last thing he inspired in female colleagues. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t even manage his own life,\u201d says one. \u201cHe used to wash his shirts in the office and hang them up in front of his desk, so you\u2019d have to come through a line of dripping wet shirts to speak to him.\u201d It didn\u2019t last: Cummings left within months, frustrated that shadow cabinet ministers wouldn\u2019t adopt his radical ideas. It was a different story when Michael Gove, then shadow education secretary, hired him as an adviser in 2007. After Gove moved from opposition to head up the Department for Education in 2010, Cummings was initially kept at arm\u2019s length, but shortly after he formally joined the department in 2011, allegations of him intimidating civil servants began to emerge. They were denied, but it is a pattern some see repeated now in his treatment of Khan and his reported response to fellow special advisers that if they didn\u2019t like his methods they could \u201cfuck off\u201d. Yet the idea that he picks on women is, say those who have worked with him, untrue. \u201cIf he likes you and thinks you\u2019re on side, he\u2019ll work very effectively with you; if he thinks you\u2019re disloyal or useless, he can be extremely unpleasant, but he did that to men and women,\u201d says a longstanding former colleague. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a woman problem, I think it\u2019s a \u2018people he doesn\u2019t like\u2019 problem.\u201d His pet hates include perceived stupidity, laziness, or ideas being blocked for seemingly vague reasons, which may explain No 10\u2019s sudden appetite for ripping up unwritten rules and conventions.

The same, however, cannot be said for his boss. The plot of Who\u2019s the Daddy?, a bedhopping farce that made its London theatrical debut in 2005, would have been so preposterous as to be incredible had it not been based on a series of real-life scandals that beset the Spectator magazine during a single year of Johnson\u2019s editorship. Co-written by the magazine\u2019s theatre critic Toby Young, it featured not only Johnson\u2019s affair with the columnist Petronella Wyatt \u2013 which ended in him being fired from the Tory frontbench for lying about it \u2013 but the Spectator publisher Kimberly Quinn\u2019s affair with the cabinet minister David Blunkett and the then deputy editor Rod Liddle\u2019s extramarital affair with a 22-year-old receptionist. Liddle\u2019s now ex-wife, the broadcaster Rachel Royce, subsequently attacked what she called an \u201call lads together\u201d culture at the magazine; in Sonia Purnell\u2019s biography Just Boris, she describes famously riotous champagne-fuelled parties \u201cfull of young things in short dresses, high heels and lipstick and the men flirting with them and ignoring their wives. I just felt that Boris was running the whole place like a knocking shop.\u201d None of this stopped Johnson being elected mayor in 2008. His move to London City Hall initially heralded a more statesmanlike phase (although within a year he was to begin an relationship with unpaid arts adviser Helen Macintyre). While most of his senior appointments were male, a recurring theme in his career, he did hire the highly regarded transport expert Isabel Dedring, plus a bright young Oxford graduate named Munira Mirza to cover culture (Mirza now runs his policy unit at No 10). \u201cI look at him now and he\u2019s got a bunch of lads around him,\u201d says a colleague from that era. \u201cBut it was much more balanced in those days. They weren\u2019t the kind of women who would put up with any mischief.\u201d Yet Jennette Arnold, leader of the London Assembly Labour group, publicly complained of his \u201cdisrespectful, patronising way at meetings\u201d with female assembly members, while some City Hall staff recall a boys\u2019 school culture of risque jokes and Oxbridge ties. Throughout his career, Johnson has tended to get on with a certain type of woman; robust, not overly politically correct, dismissive of liberal shibboleths. Mirza famously criticised May\u2019s audit of racial disparities in public services as self-flagellatory, and the new Downing Street recruit Chloe Westley, now heading Johnson\u2019s social media team, argued in a recent article defending the academic Jordan Peterson against charges of misogyny that young women had been \u201cmisled by feminists\u201d into thinking they faced discrimination over pay. His inner circle in Downing Street, meanwhile, remains resolutely male compared with Cameron\u2019s or May\u2019s: this week\u2019s spending review was presented, unusually, by an all-male Treasury ministerial lineup despite concerns about the impact of excluding women from economic policy-making.

Brown laid out the brutal reality of Haze\u2019s 24 years on this earth: the neglect, the homelessness, the abuse, the mental illness. He was \u201cdeprived of everything a child needs\u201d, Brown said, dosed with LSD as a toddler, shooting up drugs by the age of eleven. A psychiatrist once described him as a \u201cferal child\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHaze would have fared no worse or no better if he had been dropped off on a street corner after he was born,\u201d Brown said.</p> <p>Then he turned to the front row of the gallery, where the victims\u2019 families sat.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not offered as an excuse,\u201d Brown said to them, \u201cbut as an attempt to understand why we\u2019re all here.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>What \u201chere\u201d meant differed for each person in the courtroom that day. For the family members of Steve Carter, a respected tantra instructor who had moved back to California to support his wife through chemotherapy, and Audrey Carey, a free-spirited young girl with a bright future, \u201chere\u201d was a hell created by three monsters \u2013Haze Lampley; his 19-year-old girlfriend, Lila Scott Alligood; and Sean Angold, their 25-year-old friend \u2013 for whom no amount of prison time could make up for the lives they stole.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like those people just killed Steve,\u201d said Lokita Carter, Steve\u2019s widow. \u201cThey killed a huge chunk of me. They killed a whole other part of another human being.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement read at the sentencing by a prosecutor, Audrey\u2019s mother, Isabelle Tremblay, denounced all three as \u201cproof that evil exists\u201d. \u201cYou are not human beings,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>Her statement was an emotional, stinging barb, pulled from a deep place of grief to pierce into the hearts of the ones to whom it was directed. Lila sobbed through the reading, her attorney patting her on the back, while Sean kept his head down, his eyes damp. But months later, Haze shrugged at the vitriol directed at him and his two co-defendants that day. \u201cUnspeakable monsters\u201d, Isabelle Tremblay had called them. It wasn\u2019t the first time, Haze said, that he\u2019d been called a monster.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t even the first time he had been called such as it pertained to this case. Throughout the proceedings, observers and those with knowledge of the case dismissed Haze as a \u201cpsychopath\u201d, an amoral creature sowing chaos everywhere he turned. They remarked on his \u201cdead\u201d eyes, his blank stare, the way he never reacted to anything in court.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a5589e7d907c6ac0fef4f70e5be7a7ec1e9314a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5589e7d907c6ac0fef4f70e5be7a7ec1e9314a/0_249_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morrison Haze Lampley at a hearing in September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morrison Haze Lampley at a hearing in September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Tong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Authorities were quick to paint him as the ringleader, the one who called the shots, the one who pulled the trigger in both the killings. In the realm of culpability, he had the most blood on his hands, they said, and that was reflected in the charges and sentencing. Sean was sentenced to 15 years to life for the murder of solely Steve Carter, as part of the plea deal for his testimony. Lila was sentenced to 50 years to life, while Haze received a 100-year sentence.</p> <p>A \u201cmonster\u201d, they called him, but before his attorney\u2019s statement at the sentencing, few had stopped to consider what had made him this way. Few had stopped to consider what sort of life he had lived that had allowed him to deem it acceptable to rob two strangers at gunpoint, knowing full well that any misstep could end in bloodshed. Few had stopped to consider the sort of misfortunes that had shaped him into the type of young man who could witness up close the gore from one murder and still feel unaffected enough to pull the trigger on a second human being just days later. And even fewer had stopped to consider that the misfortunes that had made Haze who he is today are the same ones that have driven countless kids to a life of aimless homelessness \u2013 that the demons that haunt Haze, Lila and Sean are the same that haunt the youth we pass on the streets every day, squatting along city sidewalks amid a cloud of body odor and marijuana smoke.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/05/california-housing-homeless-rv-cars-bay-area\">The Californians forced to live in cars and RVs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because for Haze, Lila and Sean, \u201chere\u201d was the abrupt end of a complicated and treacherous journey through their youth, one riddled with violence, drug use, terror, and crime. \u201cHere\u201d was the last stop of an unforgiving path on which millions of kids, teenagers and young adults find themselves traveling each day, wandering across the country with little more than the packs on their back and nowhere to call home.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The tearful sentencing unfolded in the same courthouse that had been made famous by Angela Davis and the Black Panthers in the 1970s. Located in the heart of Marin county, the Civic Center is an architectural marvel designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, all chic curves and sleek glass atria. As the crime reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, I had spent a chunk of the 18 months it took to reach this point in the case crammed shoulder-to-shoulder with other local journalists in a modish wood-paneled courtroom, scribbling down every gruesome, bloody detail of the killings under a bizarre spherical light fixture that reminded me of a cartoon spaceship. At times, being in that stylized courtroom felt like stepping into a topsy-turvy alternate reality \u2013 at the center of which sat Haze, Lila and Sean. Eighteen months prior, deputies had marched them into the courtroom, all in their jail-issued striped jumpsuits and with their heads shaved \u2013 authorities had said they had bugs living in their tangled, matted hair when they arrived in Marin county. For a short time, their bald heads added another surreal layer to an already surreal situation.</p> <p>We at the Chronicle began referring to Haze, Lila and Sean as \u201cthe drifters\u201d pretty much from the start, and the term caught on with other news outlets as well. All the media coverage made a point to reference their youth \u2013 at the time of their arrest in October 2015, Lila had just turned 23, while Haze and Sean were 23 and 24, respectively. At 26, I was just a few years older than they were when this all began, yet as I sat there in that courtroom, 18 months later, I felt as if there were decades between us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a59783d29b264a15b99a5e760c69d8774f5e5f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a59783d29b264a15b99a5e760c69d8774f5e5f8/0_741_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lila Alligood listens to a detective testify in September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lila Alligood listens to a detective testify in September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Tong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The defendants\u2019 youth contributed to the media frenzy around the trial, but that was just one of several elements of this case that captured the attention of the Bay Area. There was a senselessness to these crimes that nobody could comprehend, a disruption to the regularly scheduled programming of our prescribed acceptable behavior in society. The fact that the three killed two strangers was especially chilling \u2013 according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s uniform crime reporting program, only about 10% of all homicides nationwide involve strangers \u2013 and the fact that they committed these murders within days of each other led many to wonder whether there had been, or could have been, more had the police not arrested them when they did.</p> <p>But most of all, what terrified Bay Area residents was the fact that Haze, Lila and Sean could have been any one of the hundreds of kids, teens and young adults we pass on the streets every day. The transient youth population is especially vibrant in California, to the point that they have their own categorization within the realm of homelessness \u2013 street kids. Mention the term \u201cstreet kid\u201d to anyone on the west coast and they will know exactly of whom you speak \u2013 the tough and, at times, confrontational kids with dreadlocked hair who spend all day lounging around in the parks or on the sidewalks. Yes, they\u2019re homeless, but somehow they\u2019re different from the downtrodden folks who line up with carts outside of soup kitchens. They have neither money nor steady employment, but they\u2019re not destitute. They\u2019re not all kids in the sense that they\u2019re under the age of 18, yet they all somehow have both a youthfulness and an aged presence about them.</p> <p>These kids were the backbone of the vagabond counterculture that became a part of San Francisco\u2019s identity, but following the slayings of Audrey Carey and Steve Carter, they became scapegoats for law-abiding citizens to fear the most. Complaints that supposedly progressive Bay Area residents had never felt acceptable to voice before spilled over in a frenzied witch-hunt, as they struggled to make peace with the dichotomy of their free-spirited history that accepted and celebrated these wanderers, and their current, unpredictable reality of street kids setting up tents anywhere they pleased, using hard drugs, urinating wherever, and holding loud all-night parties outside people\u2019s homes. At best, these kids blocked sidewalks and lived on handouts. At worst, they were a violent, threatening presence who fought among themselves and scared away customers from local businesses.</p> <p>For these Bay Area residents, \u201chere\u201d was the possibility that these kids who had long been part of the fabric of San Francisco life now had the potential to be the monsters, to be the evil that tore through Audrey Carey\u2019s and Steve Carter\u2019s families. \u201cHere\u201d was the chance that you or someone you love could be the next Audrey or Steve.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Even before the killings, street kids were regarded, in San Francisco and beyond, with a level of disdain reserved specifically for this particular subset of the homeless population \u2013 and this disdain has only continued. What little compassion we have for the homeless is saved for those who fit our ideal version of homelessness: those down on their luck, struggling to make their way off the street. On the flip side, there are the street kids. The vagabonds. The drifters. The free spirits, taking advantage of our goodwill to neglect the responsibilities set by a social contract by which we all must abide. A common narrative pushed about these kids is that they are homeless by choice. They could easily not be homeless, so the narrative goes, if they would just get a job. If they would stop being lazy. If only they didn\u2019t want this free-living life.</p> <p>To street kids and those who work with them, this narrative is not only inaccurate, but also damaging. Because for the majority of these kids, the choice is between homelessness and, for example, \u201cDo I want to stay at home and get raped every night by my uncle?\u201d, in the words of Christian Garmisa-Calinsky, who ran a nonprofit that found housing for street kids in San Francisco. \u201cOr like it was for me: do I want to stay home and get my bones continually broken by my mother?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5190131dccd0f4b9270e0faa59f43afa257b35ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5190131dccd0f4b9270e0faa59f43afa257b35ca/0_171_2801_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The public defenders David Brown, left, and Pedro Oliveros, right, speak with reporters in October 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The public defenders David Brown, left, and Pedro Oliveros, right, representing Morrison Haze Lampley, speak with reporters in October 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I had met Christian just days after the three were arrested in Portland, Oregon, at a heated Haight Street community meeting in which he acted as the voice of reason, reminding the angry masses that it\u2019d be unfair to paint all street kids with the same brush and assume all have the potential for murder. After all, just a decade ago, Christian had been part of this population, sleeping in parks with his pack underneath him and his legs tangled over his bicycle to prevent theft.</p> <p>In his time on the streets and in the work he does now, he\u2019s come across countless kids with the same sort of background as Haze, Lila and Sean. They run away to escape a life in which it was beaten into them that they were nothing, less than nothing, and then they are taken in by the streets, where the last of their humanity is ripped from them.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>\u201cThis is not offered as an excuse, but as an attempt to understand why we\u2019re all here.\u201d I had been having conversations with Christian about this very point for weeks before David Brown made this statement in court. Christian had needled me for wondering about what forced these kids into the streets, into a life of violence, drug abuse, instability and \u2013 in the case of Haze, Lila and Sean \u2013 murder. \u201cYou should focus on the solution, on how to get them off the streets,\u201d he said. Because for those who work with this population, they already know all too well that \u201chere\u201d is what happens when our children are failed, time and time again, by the systems in place. \u201cHere\u201d is the end result of instability, neglect, abuse, drug addiction, mental illness and violence that is only perpetuated the more time these hurt kids are forced to live as homeless transients, in a community of other hurt kids just as unpredictable and in need of help as they are. \u201cHere\u201d began for generations of youth before Haze, Lila or Sean were even born.</p> <p>This means little to the families of Audrey Carey and Steve Carter. They have had to endure an unspeakable loss because of these circumstances \u2013 circumstances beyond their control \u2013 a loss for which there is no excuse. But these circumstances are not being offered as an excuse. They are being offered as a way to understand this generation of lost youth, a generation of hurt kids just like Haze, Lila and Sean, many of whom find themselves every day teetering at the same precipice of no return where those three stood in October 2015. \u201cHere\u201d is not Americana folklore, Jack Kerouac and the Summer of Love coming home to roost. \u201cHere\u201d is a crisis, decades in the making. \u201cHere\u201d is millions of hurt kids, abandoned on the streets, knowing little more than doing whatever it takes to survive.</p> <p>The question, now, is where we go from \u201chere\u201d.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "In October 2015, three young drifters robbed and fatally shot Audrey Carey in the bushes of San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park and went on to kill Steve Carter for his car keys on a popular hiking trail, just over the Golden Gate Bridge. At their sentencing, 18 months later, Chief Deputy Public Defender David Brown stood to address the packed courtroom; his client, Morrison Haze Lampley, remained seated, his unruly mop of sandy-brown hair pulled back into a neat knot. Though the emotional statements from the victims\u2019 families had drawn tears from many in the gallery, as well as from his two co-defendants, Lampley \u2013 who goes by Haze \u2013 kept his expressionless stare focused on the table in front of him, just as he had for the majority of the legal proceedings. David Brown had worn a similar mask over the past year and a half, one of practiced stoicism shaped from years of courtroom experience. But on the day Haze Lampley, his teenage girlfriend and his longtime acquaintance were to be sentenced for the murders of 23-year-old Audrey Carey and 67-year-old Steve Carter, Brown spoke to the court with the candor of an attorney who knew that his client was about to spend the rest of his life in prison. Brown laid out the brutal reality of Haze\u2019s 24 years on this earth: the neglect, the homelessness, the abuse, the mental illness. He was \u201cdeprived of everything a child needs\u201d, Brown said, dosed with LSD as a toddler, shooting up drugs by the age of eleven.

Then he turned to the front row of the gallery, where the victims\u2019 families sat. \u201cThis is not offered as an excuse,\u201d Brown said to them, \u201cbut as an attempt to understand why we\u2019re all here.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 What \u201chere\u201d meant differed for each person in the courtroom that day.

They killed a whole other part of another human being.\u201d In a statement read at the sentencing by a prosecutor, Audrey\u2019s mother, Isabelle Tremblay, denounced all three as \u201cproof that evil exists\u201d. \u201cYou are not human beings,\u201d she wrote.

But most of all, what terrified Bay Area residents was the fact that Haze, Lila and Sean could have been any one of the hundreds of kids, teens and young adults we pass on the streets every day. The transient youth population is especially vibrant in California, to the point that they have their own categorization within the realm of homelessness \u2013 street kids. Mention the term \u201cstreet kid\u201d to anyone on the west coast and they will know exactly of whom you speak \u2013 the tough and, at times, confrontational kids with dreadlocked hair who spend all day lounging around in the parks or on the sidewalks. Yes, they\u2019re homeless, but somehow they\u2019re different from the downtrodden folks who line up with carts outside of soup kitchens. They have neither money nor steady employment, but they\u2019re not destitute. They\u2019re not all kids in the sense that they\u2019re under the age of 18, yet they all somehow have both a youthfulness and an aged presence about them. These kids were the backbone of the vagabond counterculture that became a part of San Francisco\u2019s identity, but following the slayings of Audrey Carey and Steve Carter, they became scapegoats for law-abiding citizens to fear the most. Complaints that supposedly progressive Bay Area residents had never felt acceptable to voice before spilled over in a frenzied witch-hunt, as they struggled to make peace with the dichotomy of their free-spirited history that accepted and celebrated these wanderers, and their current, unpredictable reality of street kids setting up tents anywhere they pleased, using hard drugs, urinating wherever, and holding loud all-night parties outside people\u2019s homes. At best, these kids blocked sidewalks and lived on handouts. At worst, they were a violent, threatening presence who fought among themselves and scared away customers from local businesses. For these Bay Area residents, \u201chere\u201d was the possibility that these kids who had long been part of the fabric of San Francisco life now had the potential to be the monsters, to be the evil that tore through Audrey Carey\u2019s and Steve Carter\u2019s families. \u201cHere\u201d was the chance that you or someone you love could be the next Audrey or Steve. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Even before the killings, street kids were regarded, in San Francisco and beyond, with a level of disdain reserved specifically for this particular subset of the homeless population \u2013 and this disdain has only continued. What little compassion we have for the homeless is saved for those who fit our ideal version of homelessness: those down on their luck, struggling to make their way off the street. On the flip side, there are the street kids. The vagabonds. The drifters. The free spirits, taking advantage of our goodwill to neglect the responsibilities set by a social contract by which we all must abide. A common narrative pushed about these kids is that they are homeless by choice. They could easily not be homeless, so the narrative goes, if they would just get a job. If they would stop being lazy. If only they didn\u2019t want this free-living life. To street kids and those who work with them, this narrative is not only inaccurate, but also damaging. Because for the majority of these kids, the choice is between homelessness and, for example, \u201cDo I want to stay at home and get raped every night by my uncle?\u201d, in the words of Christian Garmisa-Calinsky, who ran a nonprofit that found housing for street kids in San Francisco. \u201cOr like it was for me: do I want to stay home and get my bones continually broken by my mother?\u201d I had met Christian just days after the three were arrested in Portland, Oregon, at a heated Haight Street community meeting in which he acted as the voice of reason, reminding the angry masses that it\u2019d be unfair to paint all street kids with the same brush and assume all have the potential for murder. After all, just a decade ago, Christian had been part of this population, sleeping in parks with his pack underneath him and his legs tangled over his bicycle to prevent theft. In his time on the streets and in the work he does now, he\u2019s come across countless kids with the same sort of background as Haze, Lila and Sean. They run away to escape a life in which it was beaten into them that they were nothing, less than nothing, and then they are taken in by the streets, where the last of their humanity is ripped from them. \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u201cThis is not offered as an excuse, but as an attempt to understand why we\u2019re all here.\u201d I had been having conversations with Christian about this very point for weeks before David Brown made this statement in court. Christian had needled me for wondering about what forced these kids into the streets, into a life of violence, drug abuse, instability and \u2013 in the case of Haze, Lila and Sean \u2013 murder. \u201cYou should focus on the solution, on how to get them off the streets,\u201d he said. Because for those who work with this population, they already know all too well that \u201chere\u201d is what happens when our children are failed, time and time again, by the systems in place. \u201cHere\u201d is the end result of instability, neglect, abuse, drug addiction, mental illness and violence that is only perpetuated the more time these hurt kids are forced to live as homeless transients, in a community of other hurt kids just as unpredictable and in need of help as they are. \u201cHere\u201d began for generations of youth before Haze, Lila or Sean were even born. This means little to the families of Audrey Carey and Steve Carter. They have had to endure an unspeakable loss because of these circumstances \u2013 circumstances beyond their control \u2013 a loss for which there is no excuse. But these circumstances are not being offered as an excuse. They are being offered as a way to understand this generation of lost youth, a generation of hurt kids just like Haze, Lila and Sean, many of whom find themselves every day teetering at the same precipice of no return where those three stood in October 2015. \u201cHere\u201d is not Americana folklore, Jack Kerouac and the Summer of Love coming home to roost. \u201cHere\u201d is a crisis, decades in the making. \u201cHere\u201d is millions of hurt kids, abandoned on the streets, knowing little more than doing whatever it takes to survive. The question, now, is where we go from \u201chere\u201d.",

Now they increasingly come from the right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/25/dominic-cummings-role-provokes-alarm-inside-civil-service\">Dominic Cummings role provokes alarm inside civil service</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During the long, often politically placid interlude between Thatcherism\u2019s triumph in the 1980s and its undoing by the financial crisis 25 years later, rightwing British newspapers sometimes seemed to be almost willing a national emergency into being. Awful but only temporarily disruptive events, such as the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001, were often reported in apocalyptic terms. The <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1337144/How-the-foot-and-mouth-disaster-of-2001-began.html\" title=\"\">Daily Telegraph described this</a> as \u201cone of the worst social and financial catastrophes to befall peacetime Britain\u201d. With Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government in office, that assessment by the voice of the Tory shires had a whiff of wishful thinking about it.</p> <p>For the British state, national crises are both a curse and an opportunity. Many civil servants want to be consistent administrators or incremental social reformers, not crisis managers, and Whitehall\u2019s routines are disturbed by emergencies. During the three-day week, power cuts meant that staff at the Department of the Environment \u2013 then an ambitious new ministry housed in a glassy, hard-to-heat complex with bare floors \u2013 had to be issued with small squares of carpet to place under their desks to keep their feet warm. More recently, at the Department for Exiting the European Union, so many extra staff have been hastily recruited, a civil servant told me over the summer, that there are not enough toilets. The Brexit metaphor almost writes itself.</p> <p>Yet national emergencies also enable the state to increase its power. In the early 1970s, Edward Heath\u2019s Conservative government secretly established the civil contingencies unit (CCU) \u2013 a typically sly Whitehall euphemism \u2013 to maintain essential amenities and supplies across the country whenever the next big crisis occurred. The CCU combined national and local politicians, civil servants, the military and the police into something approaching a shadow government. Sometimes it seemed to have its own agenda, beyond party politics. During the winter of discontent, when strikes overwhelmed Jim Callaghan\u2019s Labour administration, the CCU\u2019s chairman, an urbane civil servant called Clive Rose, told the transport minister, Bill Rodgers, that its job was not to \u201ckeep the government in office\u201d but \u201cto see the country isn\u2019t destabilised\u201d. A version of the CCU still exists, now known as the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/preparation-and-planning-for-emergencies-the-capabilities-programme\" title=\"\">civil contingencies secretariat</a>. If a chaotic no-deal Brexit comes, it is not hard to imagine it giving Boris Johnson\u2019s administration similar warnings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1f30d850879e6965367a04a153877909562d9f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1f30d850879e6965367a04a153877909562d9f3/0_174_3014_1808/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bread queue in London in 1974\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bread queue in London in 1974: \u2018Edward Heath\u2019s Conservative government secretly established the civil contingencies unit to maintain essential amenities and supplies.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor is it hard to imagine his government ignoring them. Much is currently being said about how the confrontations and disorder around Brexit fit into a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-general-election-a9091416.html\" title=\"\">clever plan</a> devised by Dominic Cummings. That may even be the case \u2013 as much as one adviser can influence events. Yet Johnson\u2019s enormously confident, faintly otherworldly strategist could also reflect on the damage done by even fleeting national crises to previous British governments \u2013 even to governments much more competent and popular than his one.</p> <p>In 2000, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/sep/11/oil1\" title=\"\">protests against rising fuel duties</a> blockaded British oil refineries, and petrol stations across the country began to run out of fuel within days, the Blair government \u201cseemed curiously paralysed\u201d, Blair admits in his memoirs. \u201cImages of queues of cars, petrol forecourts crowded or closed, and general chaos\u201d proved \u201cirresistible\u201d to the media. In less than a month, a long-standing Labour\u2019s poll lead over the Tories of about 20% turned into a deficit of almost 10%. Modern voters quickly abandon governments that fail to protect the flow of daily essentials.</p> <p>Blair swiftly ended the crisis, partly by backing down to the protesters and freezing fuel duties. But the government was sufficiently spooked by the whole experience to pass the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/09/sweeping-powers-civil-contingencies-act\" title=\"\">Civil Contingencies Act</a> in 2004, an update and expansion of Heath\u2019s emergency powers.

      "bodyText": "Genuine national crises, where everyday life is disrupted and the status quo buckles or crumbles, don\u2019t come along often in a usually stable, sometimes boring country like Britain. Over the last half century, there have arguably been less than half a dozen: the three-day week in 1974, the winter of discontent of 1978-9, the riots and recession of 1981, the financial crisis of 2007-8, and the current, accelerating meltdown \u2013 constitutional, economic, and cultural \u2013 around Brexit. Such episodes are a nightmare for many people, but others yearn for them. Once, these catastrophists were mostly found on the revolutionary left. Now they increasingly come from the right. During the long, often politically placid interlude between Thatcherism\u2019s triumph in the 1980s and its undoing by the financial crisis 25 years later, rightwing British newspapers sometimes seemed to be almost willing a national emergency into being. Awful but only temporarily disruptive events, such as the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001, were often reported in apocalyptic terms. The Daily Telegraph described this as \u201cone of the worst social and financial catastrophes to befall peacetime Britain\u201d. With Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government in office, that assessment by the voice of the Tory shires had a whiff of wishful thinking about it. For the British state, national crises are both a curse and an opportunity. Many civil servants want to be consistent administrators or incremental social reformers, not crisis managers, and Whitehall\u2019s routines are disturbed by emergencies. During the three-day week, power cuts meant that staff at the Department of the Environment \u2013 then an ambitious new ministry housed in a glassy, hard-to-heat complex with bare floors \u2013 had to be issued with small squares of carpet to place under their desks to keep their feet warm. More recently, at the Department for Exiting the European Union, so many extra staff have been hastily recruited, a civil servant told me over the summer, that there are not enough toilets. The Brexit metaphor almost writes itself. Yet national emergencies also enable the state to increase its power. In the early 1970s, Edward Heath\u2019s Conservative government secretly established the civil contingencies unit (CCU) \u2013 a typically sly Whitehall euphemism \u2013 to maintain essential amenities and supplies across the country whenever the next big crisis occurred. The CCU combined national and local politicians, civil servants, the military and the police into something approaching a shadow government. Sometimes it seemed to have its own agenda, beyond party politics. During the winter of discontent, when strikes overwhelmed Jim Callaghan\u2019s Labour administration, the CCU\u2019s chairman, an urbane civil servant called Clive Rose, told the transport minister, Bill Rodgers, that its job was not to \u201ckeep the government in office\u201d but \u201cto see the country isn\u2019t destabilised\u201d. A version of the CCU still exists, now known as the civil contingencies secretariat. If a chaotic no-deal Brexit comes, it is not hard to imagine it giving Boris Johnson\u2019s administration similar warnings. Nor is it hard to imagine his government ignoring them. Much is currently being said about how the confrontations and disorder around Brexit fit into a clever plan devised by Dominic Cummings. That may even be the case \u2013 as much as one adviser can influence events. Yet Johnson\u2019s enormously confident, faintly otherworldly strategist could also reflect on the damage done by even fleeting national crises to previous British governments \u2013 even to governments much more competent and popular than his one. In 2000, when protests against rising fuel duties blockaded British oil refineries, and petrol stations across the country began to run out of fuel within days, the Blair government \u201cseemed curiously paralysed\u201d, Blair admits in his memoirs. \u201cImages of queues of cars, petrol forecourts crowded or closed, and general chaos\u201d proved \u201cirresistible\u201d to the media. In less than a month, a long-standing Labour\u2019s poll lead over the Tories of about 20% turned into a deficit of almost 10%. Modern voters quickly abandon governments that fail to protect the flow of daily essentials. Blair swiftly ended the crisis, partly by backing down to the protesters and freezing fuel duties. But the government was sufficiently spooked by the whole experience to pass the Civil Contingencies Act in 2004, an update and expansion of Heath\u2019s emergency powers. The act defined a national crisis in strikingly broad terms, as, among other things, \u201can event or situation which threatens serious damage to human welfare \u2026 the security of the United Kingdom \u2026 [or] disruption of [its] supply of money, food, water, energy or fuel\u201d. Over recent months, both Theresa May\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s governments have discussed how this Blair-era act could be used to respond to Brexit unrest. In January, the Sunday Times reported that Whitehall was considering \u201ccurfews, bans on travel, confiscation of property\u201d and even \u201cthe introduction of martial law\u201d. Johnson has already announced his intention to shut parliament in the run-up to Brexit, without any apparent qualms or collapse in Conservative support. The prospect of Britain\u2019s first openly authoritarian Tory election campaign \u2013 one that would be anti-parliamentary, while promising to end the Brexit crisis \u201cby any means necessary\u201d, as Cummings likes to put it \u2013 is no longer just a possibility being considered by paranoid leftists. But would such a campaign actually work? In 1974, amid the blackouts of the three-day week and a disruptive strike by the then mighty National Union of Mineworkers, Heath called a snap election in order to transform his previously conciliatory premiership into a dominant one. \u201cDo you want a strong government?\u201d he asked in a party political broadcast.

About 50 minutes into her stay she fell and hit her forehead on the cell wall, causing a brain haemorrhage that ended her life 17 days later. Leading senior constable Danny Wolters, the watch house keeper that afternoon, told an inquest he did not see the fatal fall, and rejected a suggestion his care of her had been \u201ccriminally negligent\u201d. He was shown footage of a welfare check he conducted at 5.35pm that showed him walking down to the cells and standing for three seconds at the door before leaving. He rejected a suggestion that it was a \u201cthoroughly inadequate\u201d check. He told the court on Tuesday that he said, \u201cAre you OK, Tanya?\u201d and received a \u201cyes\u201d in response.

According to the environment ministry, two-thirds of all rivers are unswimmable and three-quarters of New Zealand\u2019s native freshwater fish species are threatened with extinction. Currently New Zealanders are encouraged to check their local council websites for public health warnings before heading out for a day on the water. Contaminated drinking water is not uncommon, with 5,000 people falling ill and four dying in 2016 after sheep faeces contaminated the Havelock North\u2019s water supply 430km southeast of Auckland. Under the new plans the government is aiming to \u201cachieve a noticeable improvement in five years and restore our waterways within a generation\u201d. Immediate interim controls will be introduced on land intensification until councils around the country have freshwater protection plans in place by 2025. Higher water quality standards will be introduced for swimming spots, and farmers will be required to cease \u201crisky farm practices\u201d that pollute waterways, such as letting cows stray into waterways. From mid next year changes such as new irrigation or conversion to dairying will only happen where there is evidence it will not increase pollution, and in catchments with high nitrate levels farmers would be required to take immediate action to reduce excessive leaching. The government has set aside NZ$229m (US$145m) to help farmers transition to more environmentally friendly farming practices, but the measures have been met with uproar by the farming community, who say the Labour Coalition government has thrown the sector \u201cunder a tractor\u201d. Declining water quality has coincided with a boom in New Zealand\u2019s dairy industry, the biggest exporter in the world. Cow effluent and fertiliser run-off are significant polluters of inland waterways, as are beef, sheep and deer farming.

According to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Science (Niwa), there is no doubt that the growth in pastoral farming, particularly dairy, is the main culprit for declining river water quality over the last 20 years. But farmers say they\u2019re being pushed out and their livelihoods overlooked. \u201cIt becomes very hard to continue economically farming animals or growing vegetables under a regime like this,\u201d Federated Farmers environment and water spokesperson, Chris Allen, said. According to a recent poll, water pollution is now New Zealanders\u2019 number one concern: with 82% of respondents saying they wanted tougher protections for waterways, ranking it as a priority above the housing crisis, the rising cost of living and child poverty.",

      "bodyText": "Emily Holden\u2019s wrap of the main developments at the town hall is now live here Thanks, everyone, for tuning in to our live coverage of the 2020 presidential candidate town hall on climate change. The Guardian\u2019s Emily Holden will have a story coming shortly analyzing the major candidate\u2019s performance and summarizing their views and policies. In other US politics news: The Carolinas are bracing for intense flooding as Hurricane Dorian slowly makes its way up the east coast. A watchdog report confirmed widely held suspicions that migrant children who were separated from their parents as part of Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy faced severe psychological repercussions. Trump is facing questions over whether he used a Sharpie to alter a map of Dorian\u2019s projected path to include Alabama after the president falsely claimed the state would be \u201chit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d in a Sunday tweet. House speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement asserting that \u201cTrump properties are a cesspool of corruption\u201d and accusing the president of profiting off the presidency. Aaaaaand, that\u2019s a wrap! Some memorable moments: Joe Biden, confronted about his plans to attend a fundraiser hosted by the founder of a natural gas company, argued the host is \u201cnot a fossil fuel executive.\u201d Bernie Sanders, asked about his tweet calling Trump an idiot, said his wife disapproved but defended his words. He said Trump\u2019s stance is \u201cidiotic\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d. Asked if he would reinstate light bulb standards Trump is scrapping, Sanders responded with: \u201cDUUUHHHH\u201d. Elizabeth Warren, who was also asked about whether the government should decide what light bulbs people use, exclaimed, \u201cOh come on, give me a break!\u201d She said industries are more responsible for climate change than individuals and that systemic change is needed. Kamala Harris, asked about reducing meat consumption, professed her love: To be perfectly honest with you, I love cheeseburgers from time to time. I do. In contrast to fellow senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker supported the use of nuclear power. But he said, \u201cabsolutely, yes\u201d, he would ban offshore drilling. \u201cWhen they drill, they spill.\u201d He also said he\u2019d ban fracking on public lands, and, goaded on by a viewer shouting, \u201cDo it, do it!\u201d Booker said he\u2019d phase out the export of fossil fuels. Here are all the 2020 democratic candidates who\u2019ve participated in the town hall, once again: New Jersey senator Cory Booker Former Vice President Joe Biden South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar Former Texas representative Beto O\u2019Rourke Vermont senator Bernie Sanders Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren Businessman Andrew Yang California senator Kamala Harris Former Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro And Cory Booker is the 10th, and final, candidate to take the CNN town halls stage tonight! It\u2019s all about \u201cresiliency, resiliency, resiliency,\u201d he said. Of course, Booker, who is vegan was asked about burgers. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d he said. \u201cI hear about this all the time -- \u2018Booker wants to take away your hamburger.\u2019\u201d He transitioned to talking about industrial farms, and practices that harm animals and people. He pointed to the example of farms that spray hog refuse over fields as fertilizer. \u201cI watched how the stuff fell on the fields and then misted into the black communities\u201d that live nearby, he said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about healthy food systems and the toxins that are in our community... we need to especially be looking at communities that are low income and vulnerable\u201d Like many of the candidates before him, O\u2019Rourke was asked about meat consumption. Which means the debate questions can, more or less, be summed up as such: Oh my! It\u2019s Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s time to shine. Asked about the hurricane in Puerto Rico, and the Trump administration\u2019s response, he said: \u201cIt makes me angry... Fellow Americans were left in harm\u2019s way.\u201d He criticized Trump\u2019s attempts to redirect money from FEMA to building a border wall. His plan would be to fund disaster mitigation grants, and \u201cmake sure that the people of Puerto Rico can determine their future\u201d, he said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s independence, whether they want to remain a territory, or whether that is statehood.\u201d He also addressed the issue retreat and rebuilding in areas \u2014 including in his state, Texas \u2014 that are prone to flooding. Americans should \u201crebuild where we can\u201d, and \u201cmove where we must\u201d, with government support, he said. O\u2019Rourke also said he supports taking in more climate refugees from the Bahamas, Guatemala and elsewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he said. Bernie Sanders\u2019 response to a question about curbing population growth has raised eyebrows. Sanders was asked if he would be \u201ccourageous enough to discuss curbing population growth\u201d as a feature of his climate plan. He responded \u201cYes\u201d, before quickly pivoting to women\u2019s rights and access to birth control. \u201cEspecially in poor countries around the world where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies\u201d, he said, he supports access to family planning services. But Sanders stopped short of discouraging people to have babies if they want children. Buttigieg also addressed the issue of his own air travel and use of private planes. \u201cI took the subway today,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I fly, because this is a very big country and I\u2019m running to be president of the whole country.\u201d Air travel will always be necessary, he noted, but a solution might be to improve train systems. \u201cI\u2019m not even asking for Japanese level trains. I\u2019m happy with Italian level trains,\u201d he said, drawing a chuckle from the audience. And Pete Buttigieg has taken the stage. He said that tackling climate change \u201cis the hardest thing we will have done in my life time as a country... on par with winning World War II.\u201d \u201cWe have to unify the country,\u201d around the issue, he said. \u201cThis is going to require action at every level of government and beyond government.\u201d Fielding a question about environmental injustice, he brought up his Douglass plan for dealing with systemic racism. And asked what question he might pose to Donald Trump about climate change, Buttigieg initially responded, \u201cWow.\u201d Trump is \u201ccompletely in a different reality,\u201d Buttigieg said, coming out strongly against climate change denial. But he added that to convince conservatives and Republicans to get on board, he\u2019d use faith to frame the issue. \u201cIf you believe that God is watching as poison is being belched into the air,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you think God thinks of that. I bet he thinks, that\u2019s messed up.\u201d Back to the lightbulb question. \u201cDo you think the government should be in the business of telling you what kind of lightbulb you can have,\u201d asked CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, noting that the less-efficient \u201ccandle-shaped\u201d bulbs are a popular favorite. Warren\u2019s response: \u201cOh come on, give me a break!\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of ways that we try to change our energy consumption and our pollution,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of it is with lightbulbs, some of it is on straws, some of it -- dang -- is on cheeseburgers.\u201d She pointed out that individual decisions to forgo incandescent lightbulbs or straws have a limited impact because industries, not individuals, are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global heating. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 asked what she would say if Trump called the Green New Deal a \u201cdream\u201d \u2014 quipped that what the president is doing now \u201cis a nightmare.\u201d In a high-energy interview, she questioned how the crisis has escalated for this long despite repeated warning from scientists, blaming government corruption. \u201cWe have a Washington that works great for the wealthy and well connected,\u201d she said. \u201cA Washington that is working great for giant oil companies who want to drill everywhere.\u201d Washington is not working, however, for Americans, she said. Sanders reiterated climate change would be one of his first priorities. \u201cI don\u2019t know how any sane person cannot put it at the very top of the list,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are fighting for the survival of planet earth.\u201d He slammed Donald Trump, calling it \u201cidiotic\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d for Trump to deny climate change and refuse to act. He said his recent tweets called Trump an idiot were \u201cmaybe harsh,\u201d but said, \u201che\u2019s called me worse.\u201d Hitting the third rail of climate policy, Sanders said he would make population growth \u2014and a woman\u2019s access to birth control \u2014 a key part of his climate plan. He also wants to spend tens of billions of dollars helping workers in the transition away from fossil fuels. He would guarantee them an income for five years, as well as job training. In a rather muscular opening salvo, Bernie Sanders has raised the specter of an uninhabitable planet if the US doesn\u2019t move rapidly to address the climate crisis. \u201cThe damage to the world will be irreparable,\u201d the Vermont senator said, adding that he was proposing \u201cthe largest, most comprehensive climate plan presented by any presidential candidate in the history of the United States.\u201d Preempting questions on how he would pay for his $16 trillion climate plan, Sanders said he\u2019d scrap tax breaks for fossil fuel companies and slash military spending. \u201cAm I going to guarantee Jeff Bezos will pay no more in taxes?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d Sanders said his plan, to radically ramp up renewable energy, would create 20 million jobs over a 15-year period. \u201cWe are dealing with an existential threat to this planet, we must respond aggressively,\u201d he said. Bernie Sanders is now in the hot seat. When asked by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper whether he\u2019d reinstate the energy-saving lightbulb requirements that the Trump administration is rolling back, Sanders responded, \u201cDuuuuhhhh.\u201d Joe Biden said he\u2019ll reconsider his fundraiser scheduled for tomorrow after being confronted with its host\u2019s ties to the fossil fuel industry during the CNN town hall. Andrew Goldman is a co-founder of a natural gas company and has worked as an adviser for Biden in the past. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize he does that,\u201d Biden said during the town hall. \u201cI\u2019m going to look at what you just told me and find out if that\u2019s accurate.\u201d Biden senior advisor Symone Sanders disputed Goldman\u2019s characterization as a fossil fuel executive, tweeting: \u201cAndrew Goldman isn\u2019t a fossil fuel executive. He\u2019s not involved in the day to day operation. He\u2019s not on the board of the company, nor the board of the portfolio company.\u201d Susan Davis will be stepping down from Congress after nearly two decades. Davis is the fourth democratic member of congress who has decided to either resign or run for a different office, joining 15 republican members who are leaving. In a letter to constituents, she wrote: \u201cMy decision today represents a desire to live and work \u201cat home\u201d in San Diego. I will continue to give my all for the next sixteen months and will work as earnestly and as enthusiastically as I have always tried to do.\u201d Davis\u2019 departure is unlikely to affect the balance of congress, even as the party scrambles to find a candidate to fill her seat. Her district leans heavily democratic. At the CNN climate change town hall, Joe Biden\u2019s pitch appears to be that he\u2019s got the experience to haul other countries into line on climate change \u2014 notably Brazil \u2014 while reestablishing US leadership in climate negotiations. \u201cWe should be organizing the world, demanding change, we need a diplomat-in-chief,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cLook what\u2019s happening now in the Amazon, what\u2019s going on? Nothing.\u201d Asked about the Green New Deal, the goal set out by progressive Democrats to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, Biden hedged slightly. The Green New Deal deserves \u201can enormous amount of credit\u201d in bringing urgency to the climate crisis but lacks specifics, Biden said. \u201cMy plan brings more detail, it\u2019s based on the science,\u201d he said. Biden then reiterates his determination to prod other countries to do more. Meanwhile, #Sharpie is still trending: Biden was also asked about his plans tomorrow to attend a fundraiser hosted by a founder of a fossil fuel company. The Intercept has more background on Andrew Goldman and his natural gas production company Western LNG: Western\u2019s major project is a floating production facility off the northern coast of British Columbia designed to provide Canadian gas to markets in northeast Asia. Goldman and Biden have deep ties: Goldman served as an adviser to Biden while he was in the Senate and was the northeast director of finance for Biden\u2019s 2008 campaign. He\u2019s also an executive at the investment banking firm Hildred Capital Partners. He and his partner at the firm, David Solomon, along with their wives Renee and Sarah, will host a private fundraiser for Biden at the Solomon house, CNBC reported. Goldman also co-founded De Cordova Goldman Capital Management, which invested in \u201cnatural resources and energy.\u201d Back to the CNN town tall, where Joe Biden has taken the stage. Biden introduced the first Senate bill on climate change. But now, he\u2019s facing tough questions about his policies. The first question for Biden centered on whether his plan is aggressive enough. He aims for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and spending of $1.7 trillion. Bernie Sanders, by comparison, would eliminate carbon emissions by 2050 and spend $16.3 trillion. Elizabeth Warren aims for a faster timeline and $10 trillion. Biden defended his proposal, saying it has received good marks from environmental organizations. (He has a B+ from Greenpeace.) But he said he would love to move faster if possible. He reminded that the US produces 15% of global emissions and that the rest of the world would need to follow suit, and he said he would push other nations to act. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019d do as president of the United States is call a meeting of all the nations that signed onto the [Paris] accord in Washington, DC, to up the ante,\u201d he said. House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office has released a statement alleging that Trump is violating the constitution by using his position to promote resorts and properties. The president is violating the emoluments clause of the constitution by encouraging foreign officials to stay at his properties, the statement says. And Trump is lining his own pockets with taxpayer money by insisting that he and other US officials stay at Trump properties, calling out Mike Pence\u2019s choice to stay at Trump\u2019s Irish golf club, despite the property being an hour-long flight to and from the vice president\u2019s meetings in Dublin. Pelosi has so far resisted impeaching Trump despite mounting pressure from her fellow democrats. But her assertion that \u201cTrump is violating the Constitution by making money off of his lavish, ritzy resort properties\u201d is one of her strongest condemnations of the president yet. Klobuchar defended taking the gray wolf off the endangered species list, arguing that once a species\u2019 numbers bounce back, \u201cthen you should allow them to be delisted. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d In this thinking, she sides with Republicans who have been advocating for the gray wolf to be delisted. Populations dwindled to about 1,000 in the lower 48 states before receiving protection under the Endangered Species Act in 1975. Since then, wolves have rebounded to more than 5,000. The Obama administration also proposed removing the wolves\u2019 endangered status, but federal courts blocked the move. The wolves have drawn ire from ranchers concerned with protecting their cattle and sheep, and from hunters who say the wolves have decimated game. But conservationists say the wolves are still vulnerable and serve an important purpose in keeping elk and other populations in check. \u201cLet me get very clear, I am strongly in favor of the Endangered Species Act,\u201d Klobuchar said \u2014 separating herself from Trump and other republicans who want to dismantle it altogether. Amy Klobuchar got questions on some of her controversial and less progressive climate proposals: allowing fracking for natural gas, supporting \u201csafe\u201d nuclear power and backing \u201ccleaner\u201d coal technology. The senator has doubted the feasibility of quickly phasing fossil fuels out of the economy. Tonight, she again avoided committing to a timeline for the US to function without them. In her written climate plan says she would aim for carbon-neutrality by 2050, but it\u2019s unclear how she would get there based on her answers. Next up, we head into primetime interviews with Joe Biden at 8 EST, Bernie Sanders at 8:40 and Elizabeth Warren at 9:20. The Trump campaign is already using clips of Kamala Harris saying that plastic straws should be banned to promote their candidate... and to sell branded straws. More analysis from the CNN town hall, from The Guardian\u2019s Emily Holden: Kamala Harris insisted the US can tackle climate change without forcing Americans to make major sacrifices \u2014 a claim likely to come under attack from conservatives. \u201cJust to be perfectly honest with you, I love cheeseburgers from time to time. I do,\u201d she said. She did, however, agree that nutritional guidelines for meat should consider impacts on the environment. Harris leaned on her record as a prosecutor, noting that she has sued ExxonMobil as the former attorney general of California. She also told a victim of the wildfire in Paradise, California \u2014 which destroyed his home \u2014 that he is a \u201creal, living testament\u201d of the devastation reaped by climate change. Harris would spend $10 trillion ongoing carbon neutral by 2045, putting her plan among the most aggressive. But Harris dodged a question about whether she agreed with Bernie Sanders that nuclear power--which is about half of carbon-free electricity in the US--should be phased out. Interviewer Erin Burnett, asked much broader questions than the first host, Wolf Blitzer. She also did not interrupt Harris\u2019 answers or ask as many detailed follow-up questions. Candidate Andrew Yang, one of the few in politics who has discussed the idea of managed retreat defended his plan to move Americans living in low lying areas to higher ground during the CNN town hall. \u201cThere are already climate refugees in the United States of America, people that we relocated from an island that was essentially becoming uninhabitable in Louisiana and we moved those people,\u201d he said. Yang drew criticism previously for talking about retreat in the context of humans being \u201ctoo late\u201d to stop climate change. Yang is perhaps the only candidate to include managed retreat, which experts say might be a necessary part of adapting to global heating, as part of his official policy. The Trump administration has announced new rules to roll back Bush-era requirements for energy-saving lightbulbs. From the New York Times: The Energy Department\u2019s filing in the Federal Register will prevent new efficiency standards from going into effect on Jan. 1 under a law passed in 2007. The changes are likely to be challenged in court. \u201cWe will explore all options, including litigation, to stop this completely misguided and unlawful action,\u201d said Noah Horowitz, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency Standards at the Natural Resources Defense Council, last week in anticipation of the move. The gradual shift toward more efficient light bulbs is one of the largely unsung success stories in the fight to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cU.S. household energy consumption is down 6 percent since 2010, and this is due in part to the increase in the use of energy-efficient lighting,\u201d said Lucas Davis, a professor in the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. ... Congress passed legislation to phase out inefficient incandescent and halogen bulbs in 2007, during the administration of President George W. Bush. The subpoena is related to Trump\u2019s attempts to pardon officials at the border that violate the law in order to enforce his immigration policies. Trump denies that he\u2019s made any such offer, but the House judiciary committee cites news reports, including one from the New York Times that Trump urged the current acting DHS secretary, Kevin McAleenan, to close the US-Mexico border regardless of legal challenges, and one from the Washington Post that Trump offered to pardon officials who disregarded environmental rules and laws against seizing private property to construct a border fence. \u201cThe dangling of pardons by the president to encourage government officials to violate federal law would constitute another reported example of the president\u2019s disregard for the rule of law,\u201d said the House judiciary committee leader, Jerrod Nadler, in a statement. The Democratic town hall on the climate crisis is off to a strong start, with questions from voters for Julian Castro on flooding risks, threats to the next generation and commitments to phase out fossil fuels. Castro received applause for his pitch for new civil rights legislation to address environmental injustice. Interviewer Wolf Blitzer has been pushing Castro to expand on his answers, a tactic that will be key to an engaging and probing discussion in the absence of an official debate. The Democratic National Committee has refused to allow that kind of single-issue debate. Here\u2019s the full schedule: Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2013 5pm, interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer Andrew Yang \u2013 5:40pm, interview with Blitzer Kamala Harris \u2013 6:20pm, interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett Amy Klobuchar \u2013 7pm, interview with Burnett Joe Biden \u2013 8pm, interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper Bernie Sanders \u2013 8:40pm, interview with Cooper Elizabeth Warren \u2013 9:20pm, interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo Pete Buttigieg \u2013 10pm, interview with Cuomo Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 10:40pm, interview with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon Cory Booker \u2013 11:20pm, interview with Lemon. The marathon, seven-hour CNN climate town hall has begun. First up, Julian Castro, who started with a shout out to the former candidate Jay Inslee \u201cwho did a fantastic job of bringing this issue to the forefront of this campaign\u201d, Castro said. Stay tuned for updates and analysis from the town hall throughout the afternoon and evening. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The Carolinas are bracing for intense flooding as Hurricane Dorian slowly makes its way up the east coast. Follow our live coverage of the storm\u2019s progress. Trump is facing questions over whether he used a Sharpie to alter a map of Dorian\u2019s projected path to include Alabama after the president falsely claimed the state would be \u201chit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d in a Sunday tweet. Britain\u2019s Parliament passed a bill meant to avoid a no-deal Brexit, marking another significant loss for Boris Johnson. The prime minister also seems to have failed in his effort to call snap elections, as our UK politics live blog reports. A watchdog report confirmed widely held suspicions that migrant children who were separated from their parents as part of Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy faced severe psychological repercussions. More Democratic presidential candidates released their plans to confront the climate crisis in advance of tonight\u2019s climate-focused town hall, which is starting now on CNN. The Guardian will be covering the climate town hall, and Maanvi will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is redirecting questions about the altered Hurricane Dorian map to the White House. But the White House seems to be avoiding the issue. The map, which appeared to be altered with a Sharpie to include Alabama in Dorian\u2019s projected path, was shown by Trump during a hurricane briefing in the Oval Office. When asked later whether the map had been altered, Trump deflected the question and insisted that Alabama was a part of the forecast when he first tweeted his concern for the state on Sunday. As many fact checks have confirmed, that is not true. The AP reports: In fact, forecasts from overnight last Friday showed a small sliver of Alabama at the edge of the five-day cone of uncertainty. But by Saturday morning \u2014 more than 24 hours before Trump\u2019s warning about Alabama \u2014 the storm was predicted to pose no threat to the state. Trump was getting multiple daily briefings about the storm. A list has emerged of the military construction projects that will be defunded to pay for Trump\u2019s border wall. The list includes planned projects in 23 states and three territories. The defense secretary, Mark Esper, said in a letter to Congress that the $3.6 billion in diverted funding would be used to build 11 wall projects along the US-Mexico border. Justifying the funding change, Esper cited the national emergency Trump declared at the border in February. Democrats have unsurprisingly slammed the move as Trump\u2019s blatantly political attempt to fulfill a key campaign promise at the cost of US service members. But more surprisingly, some Republican lawmakers have also voiced criticism of the plan, complaining that the diversion of funds would prevent their states from pursuing vitally important projects. Trump once again appeared noncommittal about tackling gun violence when lawmakers return to Capitol Hill next week. During a White House event on the opioid crisis, Trump said he was considering \u201cmany different concepts and many different things including mental health\u201d to reduce gun violence. He went on to specifically voice support for building more mental institutions to \u201cget these people off the streets.\u201d But the American Psychological Statement said after last month\u2019s shootings in Dayton and El Paso that blaming the mentally ill for gun violence is \u201cunfounded and stigmatizing.\u201d Mitch McConnell told radio host Hugh Hewitt yesterday that he would not take up any gun bill in the Senate without Trump\u2019s explicit endorsement. With the president being so vague on his opinion, that seems unlikely. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign said the Democratic presidential candidate fully supports a national fracking ban, even though her newly released climate plan did not specify that. The comments from the Warren campaign came after Bernie Sanders issued a statement challenging all of his fellow presidential contenders to back a ban. All of the participants in tonight\u2019s climate-focused CNN town hall will likely be asked about a potential fracking ban. The town hall begins in just under an hour, at 5 p.m. E.T., and the blog will be covering the event. Trump said he did not know if a Hurricane Dorian map he showed in the Oval Office had been altered with a Sharpie. While receiving a hurricane briefing this afternoon, Trump presented a map of the storm\u2019s projected path, but the map appeared to be edited with a Sharpie to include Alabama. Trump falsely claimed this weekend that Alabama was at risk of being hit by Dorian, and he repeated the assertion even after it was refuted by the National Weather Service. But the president seems unwilling to let go of the false information. Greg Craig, a former White House counsel to Barack Obama, was acquitted on a felony false-statement charge in a case that grew out of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. The Wall Street Journal has more: The jury acquitted Mr. Craig, who served as a top counselor to two Democratic presidents and a secretary of state, after a day of closed-door deliberations at a courthouse in downtown Washington, D.C. The acquittal lifts a pall over Mr. Craig\u2019s otherwise distinguished career at the upper echelons of law and politics, and represents a major setback for the Justice Department, which sought to make an example of Mr. Craig as it ramped up its enforcement of the laws governing work on behalf of foreign governments. The charge against Mr. Craig stemmed from legal work Mr. Craig performed for the government of Ukraine in 2012. He and his then-law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP were hired to write an independent report for the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice evaluating the fairness of the trial of an opposition politician. ... The investigation into Mr. Craig grew out of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and was referred to federal prosecutors in Washington. Trump claimed he had \u201cno involvement\u201d with Mike Pence choosing to stay at his Irish golf club, despite the property being an hour-long flight to and from the vice president\u2019s meetings in Dublin. \u201cWell, I had no involvement other than it\u2019s a great place,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPeople like my product. What can I tell you?\u201d But Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, previously said that president had made a \u201csuggestion\u201d that the vice president stay at the Doonbeg club. The comment immediately sparked concerns that the president was trying to profit off the official trip. The British House of Commons has passed a bill meant to prevent a no-deal Brexit, marking another significant loss for Boris Johnson. But Johnson reiterated his commitment to leaving the European Union by Oct. 31, calling for elections to be held on Oct. 15. \u201cI think it\u2019s very sad that MPs have voted like this,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great dereliction of their duty.\u201d For the latest on the debate, follow the Guardian\u2019s UK politics live blog. A new Wisconsin poll found that Trump was either trailing or tied with all of the Democratic front-runners in hypothetical match-ups. According to the well-respected Marquette Law School poll, Joe Biden leads Trump by nine points in the crucial battleground state. Bernie Sanders bests Trump by four points, while Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris are tied with the president. The poll could ring alarm bells in Trump\u2019s camp. The president\u2019s 2016 victory was charged by his strength in the Midwest and he is counting on a repeat showing to secure re-election. Given that Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by just one point in 2016, it would only take a sliver of his supporters defecting to make Wisconsin blue again. Ahead of tonight\u2019s climate-focused CNN town hall, Bernie Sanders has put out a statement calling on his fellow Democratic presidential candidates to commit to a fracking ban. \u201cAny proposal to avert the climate crisis must include a full fracking ban on public and private lands,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cFracking is a danger to our water supply. It\u2019s a danger to the air we breathe. \u201cIt causes earthquakes. It\u2019s highly explosive. Safe fracking is, like clean coal, pure fiction. But, most importantly, methane from natural gas contributes to climate change and is setting us on a path to disaster. When we are in the White House, we will end the era of fossil fuels, and that includes fracking.\u201d Sanders has previously gone after his opponents, namely Joe Biden, for not proposing more sweeping plans to combat the climate crisis. The Vermont senator has called for spending $16 trillion to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050. Mike Pence is also still facing questions about his decision to stay at the president\u2019s golf course in Ireland, despite the property requiring an hour-long flight to and from the vice president\u2019s meetings in Dublin. Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, initially said Trump had made a \u201csuggestion\u201d that the vice president stay at his golf club, which immediately sparked concerns that the president was trying to profit off the official government trip. Pence tried to clear that up by claiming that the property was best suited for his large security detail, given that Trump has stayed there before. But the White House denied Trump had made the suggestion at all, leading Short to blame the incident on \u201cmisreporting.\u201d Reminder: the reporting was based on his comments to journalists. Now CNN is reporting that Trump was irritated that he was ensnared in the ethical quagmire: Trump had been irked that he was being blamed for the fallout for Pence\u2019s accommodations, sources told CNN, and Pence -- who keeps a close eye on his media coverage -- was also exasperated by the negative attention. Trump has suggested before that Cabinet officials and advisers stay at his properties while they are traveling. ... In the past, however, aides have typically ignored the recommendations, knowing it would result in a firestorm of ethics questions. On Tuesday and Wednesday, multiple White House officials expressed disbelief that Pence\u2019s office thought spending two nights at the Trump International Golf Links &amp; Hotel was good idea. The president and the vice president appear to be on very different pages when it comes to Brexit. Mike Pence, who is traveling to London this week and plans to meet with Boris Johnson, emphasized the complexity of the issue, while Trump stressed his personal rapport with the prime minister. During his visit to Ireland yesterday, Pence ruffled some feathers by urging the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, to work toward a deal that \u201crespects the United Kingdom\u2019s sovereignty and minimises the disruption to commerce.\u201d While speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump also expressed confidence in Britain\u2019s embattled prime minister, Boris Johnson. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine, and he\u2019s going at it, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBoris knows how to win. Don\u2019t worry about him.\u201d But the prime minister is facing a crucial test of his government less than two months into his tenure. After losing his first key Brexit vote in Parliament, Johnson is now calling for snap elections. (Follow Andrew Sparrow\u2019s live blog to get the latest from London.) Trump was briefed by the acting DHS secretary, Kevin McAleenan, and FEMA\u2019s acting administrator, Peter Gaynor, on the progress of Hurricane Dorian. The president said Florida was in \u201cfantastic shape,\u201d despite initial concerns that the state would suffer a \u201cdirect hit\u201d from Dorian, and he reassured Americans that the government was \u201cvery well-prepared\u201d for the storm. Still, McAleenan warned that the storm could still cause major damage along the east coast. \u201cThe hurricane remains a category 2 \u2014 a very powerful, very large storm. We are worried about significant impacts to South Carolina,\u201d McAleenan said. Trump added that the US government would assist with the recovery efforts in the Bahamas, but he somewhat oddly compared the devastation there to other past major storms that have struck the US. \u201cI must tell you, over the years there have been some hurricanes that were bigger and stronger and more powerful that hit us very hard also,\u201d Trump said. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: A government watchdog report confirmed long-held suspicions that the migrant children who were separated from their families due to Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy experienced \u201cheightened feelings of anxiety and loss.\u201d More Democratic presidential candidates, including Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris, have released their climate plans in advance of tonight\u2019s CNN town hall. Another House Republican, Bill Flores of Texas, announced he would not seek re-election next year, continuing a trend of GOP retirements in recent weeks. Hurricane Dorian is moving northward toward Georgia and the Carolinas, where it could unleash intense rainfall and flooding. The blog is still covering storm preparations and the lead-up to tonight\u2019s town hall, so stay tuned. Bernie Sanders dismissed concerns that there was not enough room in the Democratic presidential primary for both him and Elizabeth Warren, given that the two progressive senators espouse similar ideals. \u201cElizabeth is a friend of mine. She and I have known each other well over 20 years. She\u2019s going to run her campaign and I will run my campaign,\u201d Sanders told ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\u201d Despite common assumptions that Warren and Sanders\u2019 supporters are quite similar, data indicates the two groups are actually rather distinct. Our colleague David Smith reported last week: Imagined as a Venn diagram, there is common ground between Warren and Sanders voters but each has their own distinct base. A survey by the Pew Research Center this month found that about seven in 10 of Warren\u2019s supporters are white, compared to about half of Sanders\u2019 backers. Warren\u2019s supporters are substantially more likely to have a college degree compared with supporters of [Joe] Biden and Sanders. John Zogby, a pollster and author, said: \u2018Because of progressive ideology there is some sort of overlap, but they are different. Warren picks up support among women that ordinarily Sanders would not get, including former Clinton supporters who regard her as the bearer of the torch to get a woman elected.\u2019 Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson sent (and deleted) a tweet implying that the path of Hurricane Dorian could be altered with \u201cthe power of the mind.\u201d The self-help author has attracted fascination with her campaign promises to \u201charness love for political purposes\u201d and spark a \u201cmoral and spiritual awakening\u201d in the country. But the idea that those in Hurricane Dorian\u2019s path can think away the storm\u2019s effects might be a step too far for most people \u2060\u2014 particularly given the devastation Dorian unleashed in the Bahamas. Williamson later appeared to replace the original tweet with one simply offering prayers to those affected by the hurricane. House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm took a victory lap after representative Bill Flores, a Republican of Texas, announced he would not seek re-election next year. \u201cCongressman Flores is now the fifth Texas Republican to retire as the DCCC\u2019s early and aggressive investment in Texas\u2019s swing districts lays the groundwork for victory in 2020,\u201d DCCC Chair Cheri Bustos said in a statement. She added: \u201cAs more and more of their colleagues consider leaving Washington early, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that the Texodus will continue.\u201d Democrats are unlikely to flip Flores\u2019 seat, given that he won re-election by 16 points last year. But the growing trend of Republican departures could signal trouble for the GOP \u2060\u2014 which is perhaps why Republican strategists expressed surprise at Flores\u2019 announcement, as a Texas Tribune reporter noted. Beto O\u2019Rourke said the report on separated migrant children confirmed the expected psychological toll from their experiences. The Democratic presidential candidate, who previously represented El Paso in the House, has repeatedly drawn upon his exposure to the southern border to bolster his credibility. O\u2019Rourke has also said that, if Trump manages to get his border wall constructed, he would take it down as president. A separate report released today by the Health and Human Services inspector general found that migrant detention facilities were woefully substandard. Specifically, many case managers did not meet the minimum education requirements for the Office of Refugee Resettlement. \u201cSpecifically, of the 194 case managers included in our review, 67 individuals across 31 facilities did not meet the education requirement,\u201d the report reads. \u201cMost of these case managers did have a bachelor\u2019s degree, but in a field of study other than those specified by ORR.\u201d The facilities also had difficulties training and retaining employees. The report said, \u201cAt the time of our visits in August and September 2018, 28 of the 45 facilities reported current staffing shortages for mental health clinicians or case managers.\u201d The Health and Human Services inspector general also noted in its report on separated migrant children how the emotional toll of the experience triggered health complaints. \u201cPhysical symptoms felt by separated children are manifestations of their psychological pain,\u201d one doctor said. \u201cYou get a lot of \u2018my chest hurts,\u2019 even though everything is fine [medically]. Children describe symptoms, \u2018Every heartbeat hurts,\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t feel my heart,\u2019 of emotional pain.\u201d Children also feared for the well-being of their parents after they were separated from each other at the US-Mexico border. \u201cA 7- or 8-year-old boy was separated from his father, without any explanation as to why the separation occurred,\u201d one program director is quoted in the report as saying. \u201cThe child was under the delusion that his father had been killed and believed that he would also be killed. This child ultimately required emergency psychiatric care to address his mental health distress.\u201d The Youth Climate Strike Coalition, a group of youth organizations, released a set of policy demands in advance of tonight\u2019s climate-focused CNN town hall. The demands include implementing a Green New Deal, respecting indigenous lands and investing in sustainable agriculture. The groups are also planning a week of climate action, beginning with a strike on September 20th. \u201cCNN\u2019s town hall is not just a conversation about the future of America, it is a conversation about the future of our planet,\u201d Nadia Nazar, of the climate group Zero Hour, said in a statement. \u201cIn the Climate Strike policy demands, we chart out a future for elected leaders to choose children rather than profit.\u201d Our climate correspondent, Emily Holden, has also written this helpful piece on comparing the 2020 Democrats\u2019 climate plans. In preparation for tonight\u2019s climate-focused CNN town hall, more Democratic presidential candidates are releasing their plans on confronting the climate crisis. Elizabeth Warren has embraced the ideas of her former opponent, Jay Inslee, and proposed spending $3tn to transition to a clean, green economy. (Inslee dropped out of the race last month but has also aided at least one other presidential candidate, Juli\u00e1n Castro, in crafting his climate plan.) Pete Buttigieg has similarly committed to a 2050 timeline for the economy becoming carbon neutral and called for spending billions to develop greener technology and aid farmers impacted by the meteorological effects of the climate crisis. Under Kamala Harris\u2019 plan, half of all new cars sold would be zero-emission by 2030, with a push to reach 100% by 2035. She also envisioned a \u201cnew and improved \u2018cash for clunkers\u2019 program\u201d to incentivize that shift. All three of these candidates, along with seven others, will get the chance to discuss their plans tonight during the seven-hour (yes, seven-hour) CNN town hall, which begins at 5pm ET. A report from the Health and Human Services inspector general concluded that children affected by the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy experienced \u201cheightened feelings of anxiety and loss.\u201d \u201cAccording to program directors and mental health clinicians, separated children exhibited more fear, feelings of abandonment, and post-traumatic stress than did children who were not separated,\u201d the report reads. It adds: \u201cFor example, one program director noted that separated children could not distinguish facility staff from the immigration agents who separated them from their parents: \u2018Every single separated kid has been terrified. We\u2019re [seen as] the enemy.\u2019\u201d The practice of separating families who attempted to cross the US-Mexico border was part of Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy. But the practice was quickly abandoned last June amid outcry over devastating reports of migrant children begging for their parents. Another House Republican, Bill Flores of Texas, has announced he will not run for re-election next year, the latest in a string of GOP departures. Flores said in a statement that he was leaving office to spend \u201cmuch more time with my family\u201d and \u201cresume business activities in the private sector.\u201d Given that he won re-election by 16 points last year, the seat is likely to remain in Republican hands. All of that makes his announcement seemingly unremarkable. But it does underscore a widening trend of exits among the House GOP caucus. Flores is the fifth Texas Republican and fifteenth House Republican overall to announce he would retire or seek higher office. Having been first elected during the Tea Party wave of 2010, Flores has never experienced life in the House minority \u2014 until this session. His decision to leave, along with about a dozen of his colleagues\u2019 similar moves, could indicate that they don\u2019t expect the House to swing back to Republican control next year. And they\u2019d rather not spend another two years under Democrats\u2019 thumb.",

      "bodyText": "Peter Dutton has rejected any suggestion the latest Australian federal police raid on an intelligence officer was an attempt at \u201cintimidation\u201d, while maintaining the government is not seeking to extend the remit of the nation\u2019s domestic spy agencies. On Wednesday AFP officers raided the home of intelligence officer Cameron Gill, leaving with several bin bags of seized items. The AFP has not linked the raid to any ongoing investigation. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the raid was the \u201cAFP doing their job\u201d, and cautioned against what he said was \u201cspeculation\u201d regarding it\u2019s reason. \u201cThe details of this investigation would be known to the AFP and to draw links to other things I think is just mis-speculation,\u201d he said. The News Corp Australia executive Campbell Reid had labelled the latest raid as an attempt at intimidation. \u201cWe have always said the AFP raids on journalists were not intended to intimidate journalists but the people who have the courage to talk to journalists,\u201d he said in a statement. The home affairs minister rejected that suggestion. \u201cI think people who try to portray the Australian federal police other than a professional organisation of men and women led by Andrew Colvin, one of the most successful commissioners of the Australian federal police, I think they\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said from Brisbane. \u201cThey have a job to do under the law and they do it and they should be allowed to conduct their investigations, and I don\u2019t have any comment to make in relation to this particular matter, as I said before.\u201d Dutton, who is the minister responsible for the AFP, said he was not told of the raid ahead of time. The Gill raid came just months after AFP officers searched News Corp political editor Annika Smethurst\u2019s home, more than a year after she published a story suggesting the Australia Signals Directorate was seeking to broaden its powers to spy on Australian citizens without their knowledge. The government has continued to deny it was seeking any such changes, but the investigations into Smethurst\u2019s story continues. Dutton was asked again on Thursday whether there were plans to extend domestic spy powers and whether the public had a right to know about that. \u201cWhat are you referring to? What does your text from Canberra say? What are they referring to? Ask for background next time. I think you\u2019ve been set up on that question,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such proposal.\u201d Morrison was asked separately about the public\u2019s right to know about any proposal to extend spy powers and also rejected it. \u201cThe government has no such plans. Never did and so it is a hypothetical,\u201d he said. AFP officers also raided ABC\u2019s Sydney headquarters in June over a series of stories into the clandestine operations of Australian special forces in Afghanistan. The media raids have sparked two parliamentary inquiries into press freedom in Australia, which are due to report on their findings later in the year. Dutton\u2019s departmental head, Mike Pezzullo, told one of those inquiries last month that he believed the individual who leaked sensitive documents to Smethurst should, following proper judicial processes, be imprisoned, and said then police were close to identifying the source. The Labor leader Anthony Albanese said he was \u201cnot comfortable\u201d with the government\u2019s attitude towards press freedom. \u201cFreedom of the press is an essential component of our democratic system and the fact is that in terms of the basis of these raids that have occurred, whether it\u2019s the issues published by Annika Smethurst or the revelations broadcast by the ABC, they met the public interest test,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThe public did have a right to know on those things. And the truth is that journalism is not a crime.\u201d Albanese said protections for any potential whistleblowers also needed to be heavily considered. \u201cWhen whistleblowers give information that the public have a right to know, such as in the case concerned, it was about a debate taking place between government departments about surveillance, increased spying, if you like, on Australians going about their day-to-day business,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, there were privacy concerns with that. Australians had a right to know that that discussion was taking place.\u201d Morrison said there was \u201cabsolutely no question\u201d his government was \u201ccommitted to press freedom\u201d, but said again no one was above the law. \u201cAnd the law will apply. And the wonderful part about our democracy is press freedom and that is not under threat in this country, from my government or anyone else.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Myer says it will continue to cut floors and stores from its network amid falling sales at the retail empire. Sales at Myer fell 3.5% over the past year to less than $3bn, amid what has been described as a retail recession driven by stagnant wages growth and high levels of household debt. Myer\u2019s sales figures were also hurt by its decision in March to stop selling \u201cunprofitable\u201d Apple products. It said between 5% and 10% of its total floor area was under review, with areas to be given up including a level of its Melbourne store that currently sells toys and menswear. But the chief executive, John King, said he did not expect the store closures to further reduce Myer\u2019s sales. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for flat sales, if not improved sales,\u201d he told investors and analysts on Thursday. He played down concerns Australia\u2019s economy was going to fall into recession following the release of GDP figures on Wednesday that were the worst in a decade. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t use the R-word in terms of what we think of the economy,\u201d he said. Despite the fall in sales the company swung back into the black in the year to the end of July, declaring a profit after tax of $24.5m. In the previous year, it declared a loss of $486m after taking a $540m hit from slashing store numbers and sacking staff. The company is pinning its hopes on an influx of new brands after ditching Apple and losing fashion label Country Road, and has hired the Gold Logie-winning actor Asher Keddie as its new face. Myer\u2019s poor performance has been heavily criticised by its biggest individual shareholder, retail mogul Solomon Lew, who has previously blasted the company\u2019s board as \u201cclueless\u201d. Shareholder unhappiness has boiled over into a class action lawsuit over its 2014 results, which is awaiting judgment in the federal court. The company is also under pressure from its bankers to further reduce a debt pile left behind by an ill-fated stint in the hands of private equity group TPG that ended a decade ago. When TPG sold Myer to stock market investors in 2009, collecting about $1.4bn, it left the company about $420m in debt. The company reduced this to $150m in 2018 and to $86m last year and plans to reduce this further under a new deal with its bankers that will reduce the maximum amount it can borrow over coming years. The TPG era also left Myer paying large rent bills to its landlords after the private equity sold off its property portfolio and leased back the stores. \u201cWe are in deep discussions with many of our landlords about changes to our lease arrangements,\u201d Myer chief financial officer Nigel Chadwick said. Myer said it had reduced executive pay after a shareholder rebellion at last year\u2019s annual meeting delivered a second \u201cstrike\u201d against its remuneration report. But the company defended King\u2019s $1.8m pay packet, saying it was the same as that of the previous chief executive, Richard Umbers, and the company was \u201ccompeting for talent in a very small pool of international candidates\u201d. News of the profit turnaround drove Myer shares up almost 11% on Thursday morning. But at 63.2c, the price is still well short of the $4.10 paid by any investor who bought in at the 2009 IPO.",

But she has won 31 of 35 matches this season including 13 of 16 three-setters, roaring to the prestigious Indian Wells title in March, becoming the first Canadian in 50 years to win the Rogers Cup last month in Toronto and climbing to No 15 in the rankings.</p> <p>Now she is the first teen to play this far into the US Open since Caroline Wozniacki\u2019s run to the 2009 final and only the third Canadian woman in the tournament\u2019s 139-year history to reach the semi-finals after Lois Moyes in 1909 and Carling Bassett in 1984. Not even this precocious only child of Romanian immigrants, it seems, could have visualized that.</p> <p>\u201cIs this real life?\u201d the 15th-seeded Andreescu said after her tour-high 29th win on hard courts this season. \u201cA year ago I was in the [US Open] qualifying round. I remember I was suffering from a back injury. Now what I\u2019ve accomplished this year, I\u2019m honestly speechless. I need someone to pinch me right now.\u201d</p> <p>The 25th-seeded Mertens, who had cruised into the quarter-finals without allowing more than three games in a set, was locked in from the jump and broke Andreescu in the fourth game of the opener before serving out the set in drama-free fashion as the Canadian struggled to suss out her timing.</p> <p>But Andreescu, the first Canadian man or woman to play a US Open quarter-final since Patricia Hy-Boulais in 1992, showed the steely composure and taste for the fight that\u2019s buoyed her through so many marathon matches all season, finding her range with the forehand, pinning the Belgian counter-puncher back with powerful groundstrokes belying her 5ft 7in frame and mixing in drop shots to keep her off balance. She broke Mertens twice in the second to force a third, then improved her first-serve percentage to 73% in the decider right when it seemed the conditions were wearing her down.</p> <p>\u201cShe never gives up,\u201d Mertens said. \u201cHer serve was coming more in the second and the third set. She\u2019s a good runner, gets the ball back, not a lot of mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>The players exchanged holds deep into the third before Andreescu finally broke in the eighth game with a crisp backhand winner down the line. When she finally closed the show with another clean backhand on match point after just over two hours for her 12th consecutive three-set win, the highest ranked teenager on the tour was overcome by disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cElise, she played really, really well so I just tried to stay as calm as possible,\u201d said Andreescu, who finished with 40 winners against 33 unforced errors. \u201cI just told myself to stay calm and stick to the tactics, which I think really helped in the second and third set.\u201d</p> <p>Andreescu, who will crack the top 10 for the first time in next week\u2019s rankings after finishing last year at No 178, advances to a Thursday showdown with 13th-seeded Belinda Bencic, another first-time major semi-finalist who came through earlier Wednesday with a straight-sets win over Donna Veki\u0107.</p> <p>\u201cI think we are professional enough to be friends off the court but do our work on the court and stay focused,\u201d Andreescu said of her forthcoming opponent. \u201cI\u2019m sure off the court we are still friends. I really like the challenge. Some players are maybe afraid of the big courts but for me it is more motivation. I am really enjoying my tennis.\u201d</p>",

Not even this precocious only child of Romanian immigrants, it seems, could have visualized that. \u201cIs this real life?\u201d the 15th-seeded Andreescu said after her tour-high 29th win on hard courts this season. \u201cA year ago I was in the [US Open] qualifying round. I remember I was suffering from a back injury. Now what I\u2019ve accomplished this year, I\u2019m honestly speechless. I need someone to pinch me right now.\u201d The 25th-seeded Mertens, who had cruised into the quarter-finals without allowing more than three games in a set, was locked in from the jump and broke Andreescu in the fourth game of the opener before serving out the set in drama-free fashion as the Canadian struggled to suss out her timing. But Andreescu, the first Canadian man or woman to play a US Open quarter-final since Patricia Hy-Boulais in 1992, showed the steely composure and taste for the fight that\u2019s buoyed her through so many marathon matches all season, finding her range with the forehand, pinning the Belgian counter-puncher back with powerful groundstrokes belying her 5ft 7in frame and mixing in drop shots to keep her off balance. She broke Mertens twice in the second to force a third, then improved her first-serve percentage to 73% in the decider right when it seemed the conditions were wearing her down. \u201cShe never gives up,\u201d Mertens said. \u201cHer serve was coming more in the second and the third set. She\u2019s a good runner, gets the ball back, not a lot of mistakes.\u201d The players exchanged holds deep into the third before Andreescu finally broke in the eighth game with a crisp backhand winner down the line. When she finally closed the show with another clean backhand on match point after just over two hours for her 12th consecutive three-set win, the highest ranked teenager on the tour was overcome by disbelief. \u201cElise, she played really, really well so I just tried to stay as calm as possible,\u201d said Andreescu, who finished with 40 winners against 33 unforced errors. \u201cI just told myself to stay calm and stick to the tactics, which I think really helped in the second and third set.\u201d Andreescu, who will crack the top 10 for the first time in next week\u2019s rankings after finishing last year at No 178, advances to a Thursday showdown with 13th-seeded Belinda Bencic, another first-time major semi-finalist who came through earlier Wednesday with a straight-sets win over Donna Veki\u0107. \u201cI think we are professional enough to be friends off the court but do our work on the court and stay focused,\u201d Andreescu said of her forthcoming opponent. \u201cI\u2019m sure off the court we are still friends. I really like the challenge. Some players are maybe afraid of the big courts but for me it is more motivation. I am really enjoying my tennis.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of millions of Facebook users\u2019 phone numbers were exposed in an open online database, the company confirmed Wednesday, in the latest example of Facebook\u2019s past privacy lapses coming back to haunt its users. More than 419m Facebook IDs and phone numbers were stored in an online server that was not password protected, the technology website TechCrunch reported. The dataset included about 133m records for users in the US, 18m records for users in the UK and 50m records for users in Vietnam. The database was taken offline after TechCrunch contacted the web host. Facebook confirmed the report and said it was investigating when and by whom the database was compiled. A spokeswoman for the company also claimed that the actual number of users whose information was exposed was approximately 210m, because the 419m records contained duplicates. The records were likely amassed using a tool that Facebook disabled in April 2018 in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. The revelations showed how Facebook\u2019s lax approach to privacy had allowed a political consultancy to obtain personal information from tens of millions of profiles. Until then, Facebook allowed anyone to search for users by their phone number, a seemingly benign tool for finding an individual with a common name that was also readily hijacked by data scrapers. \u201cMalicious actors have also abused these features to scrape public profile information by submitting phone numbers or email addresses they already have through search,\u201d chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer wrote at the time. \u201cGiven the scale and sophistication of the activity we\u2019ve seen, we believe most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way.\u201d Facebook emphasized that the exposed data was \u201cold\u201d and would have been scraped prior to the April 2018 policy change. \u201cThis dataset is old and appears to have information obtained before we made changes last year to remove people\u2019s ability to find others using their phone numbers,\u201d a spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cThe dataset has been taken down and we have seen no evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised.\u201d The spokeswoman did not respond to questions about whether Facebook would inform users whose information was exposed or offer any mitigation to those affected, saying only that the company was still investigating. Facebook\u2019s characterization of the data as \u201cold\u201d notwithstanding, phone numbers are an increasingly important key to people\u2019s identities \u2013 and a potential vulnerability. While not as sensitive as a social security number, they are important identifiers that can be used to easily obtain significant amounts of personal information about an individual and their family from online data brokers, as the New York Times reported in August. Skilled attackers can often leverage a mobile phone number and information gained through data brokers or social media sites (such as home address, previous addresses, family members, etc) to persuade mobile phone carriers to transfer a target\u2019s phone number to a different phone. The latest high-profile victim of this type of attack, which is known as Sim swapping, was Twitter chief executive officer Jack Dorsey, whose Twitter account was hijacked on Friday by a hacking group that appears to have gained control of his mobile phone number. On Wednesday, Twitter announced that it was temporarily disabling the ability for users to send tweets through SMS, or text messages, due to \u201cvulnerabilities that need to be addressed by mobile carriers\u201d.",
