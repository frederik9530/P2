Among the moves were creating 10,000 more prison places and scrapping the automatic release of some violent and sex offenders at the midway point of their jail term.</p> <p>Albutt, who was elected last year as the head of the trade union, will say: \u201cDo not put more offenders in prison for longer, it will not reduce crime and the risk and cost to society.</p> <p>\u201cInstead, invest that money in creating real rehabilitative environments both inside prisons and in the community that can be accessed by all. This policy will have a far better chance of reducing crime and reoffending and will also help stabilise our prisons and make them effective once again.\u201d</p> <p>She will add: \u201cStop playing politics with our prisons. Constant changing policy on prisons dictated by whoever holds the office of prime minister and justice secretary has without a doubt contributed to the myriad of complex issues we face. Policy should always be based on the evidence of what works and should be funded appropriately.\u201d</p> <p>Albutt praised the former justice secretary David Gauke for his \u201csensible approach\u201d, since shelved under his Johnson-appointed successor, Robert Buckland.</p> <p>Gauke was pushing for an evidence-based approach to justice and was reportedly moving towards introducing an assumption against short jail sentences of six months or less, but Buckland and Johnson have said this will not happen on their watch.</p> <p>In the last five years there have been more than 250,000 custodial sentences of six months or less, and more than 300,000 of 12 months or less. Nearly two-thirds of those offenders go on to commit a further crime within a year of being released.</p> <p>Albutt will say: \u201cEngland and Wales already has the highest prison population in western Europe, with little impact on reducing crime in our communities. Britain seems to enjoy locking too many people up for too long in too small a space and with too little training and rehabilitation.</p> <p>\u201cLike many other public services, the years of austerity in prisons has left a legacy which, in a nutshell, has made a significant number of our prisons universities of crime, places of despair, fear, violence and control. They do not provide the rehabilitative environment to make people better citizens and reduce the burden on society.</p> <p>\u201cWe know intuitively and research shows that prison and longer sentences do not work for most. It does keep people off our streets for the period they are incarcerated, but almost all offenders will be released at some point.\u201d</p> <p>Albutt will say levels of poor physical and mental health, substance addiction and learning difficulties in prisons are high among those in custody, and to rehabilitate such criminals requires a multi-disciplinary approach.</p> <p>She will say: \u201cA key emotion in getting offenders to engage in any rehabilitation is hope for the future. For many years now we have had the ability to release prisoners at the halfway point of the custodial element of their sentence. This motivational policy helps the individual, but also helps with stability of prisons because of the element of hope it brings.</p> <p>\u201cIncreasing the custodial element to two-thirds in prison will certainly punish the individual for longer, but it will not improve the level of risk the individual may pose and will certainly not reduce the level of crime in society. Potentially a shorter time on licence in the community could increase risk.\u201d</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \u201cThis government is investing \u00a32.5bn in 10,000 new, modern prison places and will also spend an extra \u00a3156m next year on maintaining our existing jails. This will help us respond to any rise in prison population created by the increase in police officers on our streets, along with tougher sentencing for the most serious offenders.</p> <p>\u201cWe will of course make sure that all new prisons are sufficiently staffed and our officers will be better protected thanks to the \u00a3100m we are spending on new security measures across the estate.\u201d</p>",

This policy will have a far better chance of reducing crime and reoffending and will also help stabilise our prisons and make them effective once again.\u201d She will add: \u201cStop playing politics with our prisons. Constant changing policy on prisons dictated by whoever holds the office of prime minister and justice secretary has without a doubt contributed to the myriad of complex issues we face. Policy should always be based on the evidence of what works and should be funded appropriately.\u201d Albutt praised the former justice secretary David Gauke for his \u201csensible approach\u201d, since shelved under his Johnson-appointed successor, Robert Buckland. Gauke was pushing for an evidence-based approach to justice and was reportedly moving towards introducing an assumption against short jail sentences of six months or less, but Buckland and Johnson have said this will not happen on their watch. In the last five years there have been more than 250,000 custodial sentences of six months or less, and more than 300,000 of 12 months or less. Nearly two-thirds of those offenders go on to commit a further crime within a year of being released. Albutt will say: \u201cEngland and Wales already has the highest prison population in western Europe, with little impact on reducing crime in our communities. Britain seems to enjoy locking too many people up for too long in too small a space and with too little training and rehabilitation. \u201cLike many other public services, the years of austerity in prisons has left a legacy which, in a nutshell, has made a significant number of our prisons universities of crime, places of despair, fear, violence and control. They do not provide the rehabilitative environment to make people better citizens and reduce the burden on society. \u201cWe know intuitively and research shows that prison and longer sentences do not work for most. It does keep people off our streets for the period they are incarcerated, but almost all offenders will be released at some point.\u201d Albutt will say levels of poor physical and mental health, substance addiction and learning difficulties in prisons are high among those in custody, and to rehabilitate such criminals requires a multi-disciplinary approach. She will say: \u201cA key emotion in getting offenders to engage in any rehabilitation is hope for the future. For many years now we have had the ability to release prisoners at the halfway point of the custodial element of their sentence. This motivational policy helps the individual, but also helps with stability of prisons because of the element of hope it brings. \u201cIncreasing the custodial element to two-thirds in prison will certainly punish the individual for longer, but it will not improve the level of risk the individual may pose and will certainly not reduce the level of crime in society. Potentially a shorter time on licence in the community could increase risk.\u201d A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \u201cThis government is investing \u00a32.5bn in 10,000 new, modern prison places and will also spend an extra \u00a3156m next year on maintaining our existing jails. This will help us respond to any rise in prison population created by the increase in police officers on our streets, along with tougher sentencing for the most serious offenders. \u201cWe will of course make sure that all new prisons are sufficiently staffed and our officers will be better protected thanks to the \u00a3100m we are spending on new security measures across the estate.\u201d",

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the scale of the government response required to firefight a flatlining economy in the event of a disorderly departure from the EU would come with a hefty price tag for the public purse. In a warning to Boris Johnson as his Brexit plan risked unravelling in the face of stiff opposition at home and abroad, the thinktank said government borrowing was already set to more than double next year regardless of the outcome of negotiations with Brussels. It also said the national debt \u2013 the sum total of all borrowing accumulated by the British state \u2013 would hit almost 90% of GDP if Britain crashed out of the EU without a deal, its highest level since the mid-1960s.

However, it said no-deal Brexit could cause economic growth to flatline in 2020-21, even if the Bank of England cut interest rates and the government stepped in with emergency tax cuts and higher spending. Describing the scenario emerging from a \u201crelatively benign\u201d no-deal Brexit, the IFS said the budget deficit would rise to almost \u00a3100bn or 4% of GDP by 2021-22, reversing the progress over the past decade of producing gradually smaller deficits. The budget deficit peaked in 2009-10 after the banking crisis at almost \u00a3160bn, before gradually falling as David Cameron and George Osborne cut spending using a policy of austerity to reduce it.

It said the plans for day-to-day spending next year had taken Conservative policy close to offering the same level of funding for public services implied by Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto. The IFS said the government had in effect abandoned the former chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s borrowing rules, including a Conservative manifesto pledge to eliminate the deficit entirely by the mid-2020s.

      "bodyText": "Should Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r need cheering up at any point in the next few days he can at least reflect that Manchester United are still the club everyone is talking about. In terms of the title race Manchester City\u2019s defeat by Wolves was the shock of the weekend, the result absolutely no one was expecting, yet it was United\u2019s altogether more predictable failure at Newcastle that has dominated the news agendas. United are in the bottom half of the table, having made their worst start to a season for 30 years. Solskj\u00e6r has still not won away from home since being appointed permanent manager and in their past three away games United have failed to score, not even registering a shot on target in their Europa League match against AZ Alkmaar last week. It seems a long time now since the euphoria that followed March\u2019s stirring win at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, when Solskj\u00e6r was pictured celebrating with Sir Alex Ferguson and Eric Cantona and quoted as saying : \u201cWe are Man United: this is what we do.\u201d That result more than anything persuaded Ed Woodward and the United board to call off their search for an experienced manager and promote the caretaker, yet no sooner was the decision implemented than results began to fall off a cliff. Since the beginning of April United have picked up 14 points from 15 games. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool, for purposes of comparison, have taken 42 points from 14 in the same period. Liverpool happen to be United\u2019s next Premier League opponents, and Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side are not in good shape going into the big north-west derby. Alan Shearer believes it is the worst United side he has seen in years, David de Gea admits everything is going wrong and Gary Neville has suggested the fault lies at boardroom level. Everyone, it seems, has an opinion on Manchester United, because after years of lording it at the top of the table the club now serves up crises as regularly as it used to claim trophies. How serious is this one and how long will it continue? It depends how quickly the club can come up with answers to the following questions. Could United be relegated? Unlikely, though nothing is impossible and anyone with memories of 1974 will doubtless see certain similarities with the present situation. United bought three good players in the summer and will spend again in January if they have to, though if results have not improved by that stage the bigger question mark will be hanging over the manager. Solskj\u00e6r has suggested a goalscorer will be the priority, and United could certainly use a reliable one along with a regular centre-back partner for Harry Maguire, yet as a succession of managers have noticed since Ferguson stepped down the days when the club could merely click their fingers and expect the latest hot young prospect to join are long gone. Most capable players would want to sign for a club in the Champions League bracket, for a start, not one operating in the wrong half of the domestic table and struggling to convince in the Europa League. No one is ever too good to go down, and United at the moment are not striking many observers as good in any way, yet it would still be a surprise to find players of the quality of Paul Pogba, De Gea and Maguire embroiled in a relegation battle. Why are they in this mess? The Neville theory is that United have hired and fired too many managers post-Ferguson, all with contrasting styles and philosophies, and because they have backed each with fairly generous amounts of money they have ended up with the footballing equivalent of Frankenstein\u2019s monster, something that from a distance resembles a team but on closer inspection turns out to be a collection of ill\u2011fitting parts rather clumsily bolted together. This is a valid criticism, as is the failing to recruit a director of football or its equivalent despite identifying the need more than a year ago, though in terms of what is happening right now many supporters would simply point at the decision to over-promote Solskj\u00e6r. He remains an inexperienced manager, and there was simply no need to appoint him before the end of last season. Had United stuck to their original plan Solskj\u00e6r might be back in Norway by now with a fat cheque in his pocket and his reputation as a United hero forever enhanced. Instead he is having his limitations exposed on a weekly basis and even the goodwill carried over from his days as a popular, likable player will soon be in short supply. What can they do to fix it? They could try sacking the manager and bringing someone else in, maybe even acting quickly enough to make the adjustment in the present international break, though if they do pursue that course of action, the executive vice-chairman Woodward would be duty bound to tender his resignation too as an admission of joint culpability. The chances of that happening are vanishingly small, so Solskj\u00e6r will probably get to stay a little longer in the hope he can dig himself out of a hole. The manager has pleaded for patience from the board and patience was what Ferguson was granted in his early years when the board could see he was doing something right, even if results were not immediately forthcoming.

Diego Fernandez Castro\u2019s model of the Alhambra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: British Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Castro\u2019s model transfixes you in this exhibition. Delicate patterns of filigree stucco hang in space over slender columns in a theatrical layering of white arches. Brightly coloured tiles are laid out in intricate tessellations within the lighter-than-air galleries. Where the Sistine ceiling depicts creation as a story, the Alhambra expresses the glory of the cosmos in crystalline patterns and systems inspired by the Arab scientific revolution that started in the 8th century \u2013 and that also, Boris, provided European artists such as Michelangelo with the optics of perspective.</p> <p>The Alhambra was the last flowering of Islamic art in Spain before it finally fell to the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492. Its beauty has seduced westerners ever since \u2013 as have the Koutoubia mosque in Marrakech, the Red Gate of Rabat and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, of which admiring depictions by Europeans are in this perspective-shifting exhibition.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson should visit this exhibition that reveals Europe\u2019s artistic debt to Islam. The prime minister claims the Muslim world has produced \u201cnothing like\u201d the Sistine Chapel, a wonder \u201cbeyond the technical accomplishment of Islamic art\u201d. Tell that to Diego Fernandez Castro. In the late 19th century, this Spanish artist created a loving model of the Alhambra palace in Granada that expresses the exact opposite: this glorious medieval Andalusian palace is indeed an Islamic equal of the Sistine Chapel. Castro\u2019s model transfixes you in this exhibition. Delicate patterns of filigree stucco hang in space over slender columns in a theatrical layering of white arches. Brightly coloured tiles are laid out in intricate tessellations within the lighter-than-air galleries. Where the Sistine ceiling depicts creation as a story, the Alhambra expresses the glory of the cosmos in crystalline patterns and systems inspired by the Arab scientific revolution that started in the 8th century \u2013 and that also, Boris, provided European artists such as Michelangelo with the optics of perspective. The Alhambra was the last flowering of Islamic art in Spain before it finally fell to the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492. Its beauty has seduced westerners ever since \u2013 as have the Koutoubia mosque in Marrakech, the Red Gate of Rabat and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, of which admiring depictions by Europeans are in this perspective-shifting exhibition. The image here of the Dome of the Rock was drawn in 1486 in a Renaissance map of the Holy Land. There\u2019s a drawing nearby by Peter Paul Rubens of Ottoman costumes, probably copied from a Turkish album to supply exotic ideas for his sensational paintings of lion hunts and battles.

The veterans charity Help for Heroes said the experiences of those seriously wounded, with mental health problems or otherwise unable to serve could be vastly improved with the introduction of some basic medical practices. At the launch of a campaign, Mel Waters, the Help for Heroes chief executive, said forces personnel should be given a proper medical assessment before being discharged and a full diagnosis should be shared with the NHS to ensure continuity of care. \u201cThe medical discharge process is seriously failing those who are let down by major inconsistencies in support, so we\u2019re calling on the government to commission an independent review,\u201d Waters said. A total of 36,696 people have been medically discharged over the past 20 years, according to the Ministry of Defence (MoD), including 1,869 in 2018-19, mostly from musculoskeletal injuries and mental and behavioural disorders. Seven out of 10 veterans surveyed by Help for Heroes said they had had a negative or very negative experience of their transition out of the armed forces, with some reporting feeling abandoned almost overnight once their health deteriorated. Tommy Lowther, from Darlington, was abruptly discharged from the army in 2001 while he was on compassionate leave, after having been raped by three men, who were not soldiers, while he was in Gibraltar on military exercises. \u201cI went from being a confident young man bursting with pride to be in the armed forces to feeling broken,\u201d Lowther said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t believe me at first, and I had to undergo a medical examination.

Actually, it kind of suits her. Combined with the right amount of \u201csod the patriarchy\u201d swagger, dirty joggers, purple furry coat and unbrushed hair can be a certified look. Don\u2019t expect everyone to get it, though. \u201cYou all right?\u201d asks Liz (Diane Morgan) as Julia slumps down at their usual cafe table. \u201cYou look like a mental patient.\u201d</p> <p>Ah, Liz. For all that Motherland innovates in the field of onscreen mum representation, Liz hails from that older sitcom tradition of take-no-crap heroes, stretching back to Roseanne via Lois from Malcolm in the Middle and the gone-too-soon Della in Raised By Wolves. Liz\u2019s one-liners should be compiled into a how-to manual and handed out to all new parents. Wisdom such as: \u201cLife\u2019s too short to dick about with aubergines\u201d and: \u201cYou wait till he gets on Tinder; see how much of a co-parent he is then\u201d cannot be allowed to pass us by in a flurry of farce.</p> <p>Yet it\u2019s Julia, not Liz, who gets the most screen time and is presumably intended as the most relatable. In the American high-school cafeteria that is the mums\u2019 favourite local cafe, Julia is huddled at a too-small, toilet-adjacent table with her fellow misfits, while Amanda (Lucy Punch) heads up the Mean Girls in a superior spot. Into that finely balanced hierarchy, series two introduces a new character, Meg (played by Tanya Moodie), a high-flying business exec with five kids who still finds time to party hearty (\u201cThat one has a fridge full of Yops and Red Bulls,\u201d observes Liz sagely. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic 90s comedown concoction.\u201d)</p> <p>Meg is the manifestation of Julia\u2019s \u201chaving it all\u201d anxiety and therefore less a fully rounded character, more an awestruck Forbes magazine profile. Hopefully, we will get to know Meg better in the already-commissioned third series, just as this series has gifted soggy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/12/motherland-paul-ready-interview-macbeth-michelle-terry-shakespeare-globe\" title=\"\">stay-at-home dad Kevin (Paul Ready)</a> with a believable backbone. For now, though, her introduction could read like a panicked attempt to pre-empt criticism \u2013 the Motherland version of Donald Glover\u2019s season-two Girls cameo. And to what end? This is still a sitcom by white middle-class mums, about white middle-class mums.</p> <p>Let other sitcoms skewer other postcodes. Motherland doesn\u2019t realistically reflect the diversity of a typical London state primary, but it does do a terrific job at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/07/motherland-review-a-terrifying-no-holds-barred-glimpse-into-parenthood\" title=\"\">satirising one specific stratum of school-gate society</a>. It\u2019s a world in which allegiances are fast-shifting. The misfit mums\u2019 camaraderie often tips far enough towards smug to make you side with their enemies, and Julia\u2019s gobsmacking selfishness and capacity to exploit others can make Amanda\u2019s villainy seem redundant. All of which is true to the general fallibility of humans who happen to have children, not to mention hilarious.</p> <p>It\u2019s common sense, really, the observation that stress doesn\u2019t typically transform people into selfless saints. But the show\u2019s insight goes deeper and darker still. Are these people all really friends? Or are they, as Kevin worries, \u201cjust friendly\u201d? Are the other mothers just life rafts Julia will cling to until she reaches the safe shore of her youngest child\u2019s 18th birthday, when they will be hastily discarded?</p> <p>Motherland probably won\u2019t still be on air then, but it could be. From Kevin\u2019s Brexit picture book to the yummy-mummification of the high street and dick pic etiquette for single parents, there\u2019s an abundance of storylines here, enough to fill 20 series. High school has given us great television as varied as The Inbetweeners and Buffy the Vampire Slayer; why should this equally intense life stage be any less of an inspiration?</p>",

For all that Motherland innovates in the field of onscreen mum representation, Liz hails from that older sitcom tradition of take-no-crap heroes, stretching back to Roseanne via Lois from Malcolm in the Middle and the gone-too-soon Della in Raised By Wolves. Liz\u2019s one-liners should be compiled into a how-to manual and handed out to all new parents. Wisdom such as: \u201cLife\u2019s too short to dick about with aubergines\u201d and: \u201cYou wait till he gets on Tinder; see how much of a co-parent he is then\u201d cannot be allowed to pass us by in a flurry of farce. Yet it\u2019s Julia, not Liz, who gets the most screen time and is presumably intended as the most relatable. In the American high-school cafeteria that is the mums\u2019 favourite local cafe, Julia is huddled at a too-small, toilet-adjacent table with her fellow misfits, while Amanda (Lucy Punch) heads up the Mean Girls in a superior spot. Into that finely balanced hierarchy, series two introduces a new character, Meg (played by Tanya Moodie), a high-flying business exec with five kids who still finds time to party hearty (\u201cThat one has a fridge full of Yops and Red Bulls,\u201d observes Liz sagely. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic 90s comedown concoction.\u201d) Meg is the manifestation of Julia\u2019s \u201chaving it all\u201d anxiety and therefore less a fully rounded character, more an awestruck Forbes magazine profile. Hopefully, we will get to know Meg better in the already-commissioned third series, just as this series has gifted soggy stay-at-home dad Kevin (Paul Ready) with a believable backbone. For now, though, her introduction could read like a panicked attempt to pre-empt criticism \u2013 the Motherland version of Donald Glover\u2019s season-two Girls cameo. And to what end? This is still a sitcom by white middle-class mums, about white middle-class mums. Let other sitcoms skewer other postcodes. Motherland doesn\u2019t realistically reflect the diversity of a typical London state primary, but it does do a terrific job at satirising one specific stratum of school-gate society. It\u2019s a world in which allegiances are fast-shifting. The misfit mums\u2019 camaraderie often tips far enough towards smug to make you side with their enemies, and Julia\u2019s gobsmacking selfishness and capacity to exploit others can make Amanda\u2019s villainy seem redundant. All of which is true to the general fallibility of humans who happen to have children, not to mention hilarious. It\u2019s common sense, really, the observation that stress doesn\u2019t typically transform people into selfless saints. But the show\u2019s insight goes deeper and darker still. Are these people all really friends? Or are they, as Kevin worries, \u201cjust friendly\u201d? Are the other mothers just life rafts Julia will cling to until she reaches the safe shore of her youngest child\u2019s 18th birthday, when they will be hastily discarded? Motherland probably won\u2019t still be on air then, but it could be. From Kevin\u2019s Brexit picture book to the yummy-mummification of the high street and dick pic etiquette for single parents, there\u2019s an abundance of storylines here, enough to fill 20 series. High school has given us great television as varied as The Inbetweeners and Buffy the Vampire Slayer; why should this equally intense life stage be any less of an inspiration?",

He has undergone a scan and while there is a degree of optimism in the camp, with the No 8 not required to wear a protective boot or use crutches, England were not due to learn the full extent of his injury until Tuesday. The 26-year-old suffered the injury in the first half of England\u2019s 39-10 victory but played on until half-time with his left ankle heavily strapped. He was then replaced by Lewis Ludlam and was notable by his absence during the post-match celebrations on the pitch. With qualification for the quarter-finals already secured, Eddie Jones is expected to make a number of changes to his side but Vunipola is the only player to start all 12 of England\u2019s Tests this year. Jones dismissed the suggestion that he was taking a risk by not resting Vunipola for England\u2019s second pool match against the USA given his recent injury history but will anxiously await the bulletin from his medical staff. \u201cHe has had a scan and that is ongoing, and we will have a clearer picture tomorrow,\u201d said the England assistant coach, Neal Hatley. \u201cHe has another 24 hours and then we will make a firm diagnosis.\u201d If Vunipola is sidelined it leaves England light on experience in the back row. He is the only specialist No 8 in the 31-man squad and the other four loose forwards \u2013 Ludlam, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill and Mark Wilson \u2013 have a combined total of 49 caps, only one more than Vunipola alone. When Ludlam came on against the Pumas, Curry \u2013 who is still adjusting to his new role of blindside flanker \u2013 moved to No 8 while Wilson started there for three of England\u2019s autumn internationals last year. Hatley revealed both have been training in the position as a contingency plan. \u201cWe have done sessions where we have varied who plays at eight,\u201d said Hatley. \u201cWe knew coming into the tournament how we would have to move people around so we have trained accordingly with the different back-rows in those positions.\u201d While England may lack experience in the back row they do have considerable depth in terms of ball-carriers with Mako Vunipola back to full fitness and Kyle Sinckler, Manu Tuilagi and Maro Itoje all fit and available. \u201cEddie made us aware of it when Billy came off at half-time,\u201d said the England hooker Jamie George. \u201cHe said there will be potentially be a little more responsibility for the other guys to step up and want the ball now. You work towards the ball all the time anyway. If [Billy] does or he doesn\u2019t play then we\u2019re all aware that we need to get our hands on the ball and impose ourselves physically.\u201d Meanwhile, Hatley delivered a more bullish update on Joe Marler, who was able to train on Monday despite a back problem. Marler has started all three of England\u2019s matches to date so may well make way for Mako Vunipola against France. \u201cHe has done training this morning and he has played a lot of rugby for us and it\u2019s a position we have good strength in, and we will see how he pulls up to make sure we put out the strongest team possible,\u201d said Hatley. \u201cThere is a little bit of referral in his back and we will see how he is tomorrow.\u201d",

If France opt to field an under-strength team, for example, might it not make some sense strategically to rest a couple of key men themselves?</p> \n<p>Jones has already indicated he is contemplating a few changes and it is not hard to see why. Stick with the same starting XV having already qualified and he may have some cause for regret should injury subsequently strike and force him to pick a rusty replacement for a big knockout game. \u201cWe recognise we\u2019re not going to play the same 23 from start to finish,\u201d the scrum coach, Neal Hatley, said. \u201cIf someone hasn\u2019t played for five weeks, you can\u2019t just throw him in and say: \u2018Right, off you go.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Among the fringe candidates who might benefit from a run-out are Mako Vunipola, Jack Nowell and Henry Slade, with Ellis Genge, Joe Launchbury, Mark Wilson and Joe Cokanasiga other possible candidates off the bench.

With the greater good in mind, might it be worth easing George Ford, perhaps England\u2019s best player in their opening three games, on to the bench for this encounter, starting Farrell at 10 and pairing Slade and Manu Tuilagi in midfield? With Jonny May and Nowell on the wings, Anthony Watson at full-back and Cokanasiga on the bench, that would also keep Elliot Daly fresh for the bigger climbs ahead.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b77f5e479be0d55871b9c81da8123dc40d389d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b77f5e479be0d55871b9c81da8123dc40d389d0/17_60_2856_1713/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Eddie Jones risk George Ford against France?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Eddie Jones risk George Ford against France?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Or, alternatively, does the head coach simply say: \u201cPlay it again, Sam,\u201d to the increasingly influential Sam Underhill and his back-row sidekick Tom Curry on the basis that if you want a job done well it pays to employ a busy man? England\u2019s management were encouraged by the tireless Curry\u2019s efforts as a stand-in No 8 in the second half against Argentina and continue to appreciate the enthusiasm Lewis Ludlam brings to the party.</p> \n<p>Even more crucial, though, is that everyone keeps sight of this squad\u2019s primary aim in Japan.

      "bodyText": "Rarely, if ever, have England been involved in a World Cup fixture which their opponents would secretly prefer to lose. France\u2019s players and coaches will not shout it from the Imperial Palace rooftops but they know an English win in the Pool C contest on Saturday will offer Les Bleus a slightly enhanced chance of success in the knockout stages. Not so much Le Crunch, then, and more L\u2019\u00c9nigme. Finish second in Pool C and France will potentially be in line to face the familiar threat of Wales in the quarter-finals and avoid the half of the draw occupied by New Zealand. Beat England and, conversely, they may well have to defeat the Wallabies and the All Blacks on consecutive weekends merely to reach the final. It all makes life slightly less straightforward than it would otherwise be for Eddie Jones\u2019s squad. If France opt to field an under-strength team, for example, might it not make some sense strategically to rest a couple of key men themselves? Jones has already indicated he is contemplating a few changes and it is not hard to see why. Stick with the same starting XV having already qualified and he may have some cause for regret should injury subsequently strike and force him to pick a rusty replacement for a big knockout game. \u201cWe recognise we\u2019re not going to play the same 23 from start to finish,\u201d the scrum coach, Neal Hatley, said. \u201cIf someone hasn\u2019t played for five weeks, you can\u2019t just throw him in and say: \u2018Right, off you go.\u2019\u201d Among the fringe candidates who might benefit from a run-out are Mako Vunipola, Jack Nowell and Henry Slade, with Ellis Genge, Joe Launchbury, Mark Wilson and Joe Cokanasiga other possible candidates off the bench. Jones clearly needs to find an alternative to Billy Vunipola, who twisted an ankle in the 39-10 win against Argentina on Saturday, but there is a wider juggling act to consider as well. In a perfect world, for example, Jones would prefer to be seeing more from two of his key playmakers, Owen Farrell and Ben Youngs. With the greater good in mind, might it be worth easing George Ford, perhaps England\u2019s best player in their opening three games, on to the bench for this encounter, starting Farrell at 10 and pairing Slade and Manu Tuilagi in midfield? With Jonny May and Nowell on the wings, Anthony Watson at full-back and Cokanasiga on the bench, that would also keep Elliot Daly fresh for the bigger climbs ahead. Or, alternatively, does the head coach simply say: \u201cPlay it again, Sam,\u201d to the increasingly influential Sam Underhill and his back-row sidekick Tom Curry on the basis that if you want a job done well it pays to employ a busy man? England\u2019s management were encouraged by the tireless Curry\u2019s efforts as a stand-in No 8 in the second half against Argentina and continue to appreciate the enthusiasm Lewis Ludlam brings to the party. Even more crucial, though, is that everyone keeps sight of this squad\u2019s primary aim in Japan. Just four more wins and they will be hoisting the Webb Ellis Cup; now is not the time for unnecessary distractions. \u201cYou get momentum from winning and we want to win all the games,\u201d said Hatley, making clear the squad would much prefer to qualify first rather than second. \u201cEngland are playing France, I can\u2019t imagine anyone not taking that full out, 100mph seriously. We want to top the pool. There\u2019s been no team who have ever won a World Cup having lost a pool game and that for us sets a precedent. France is a traditional enemy and we want to beat them.\u201d The players have a similar mindset; at this stage of a World Cup no one wants to risk someone else coming in and taking their shirt.

It\u2019s another opportunity to represent your country in a World Cup, which as we all know is very rare.\u201d May, scorer of 19 tries in 30 Tests in the three years since he first played for England under Jones, is equally keen to be involved, having already scored three tries against France in the Six Nations this year. \u201cYou feel it building all week,\u201d the Leicester winger said. \u201cWe have done so much training that you feel ready to go off like a rocket at the weekend.\u201d From England\u2019s perspective, beating France is never a mixed blessing.",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Stephen Smiley bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 8 October.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Victorian Labor has used a tightly held submission to a review of the May election result to argue for states to have more input into the national campaign</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/08/secret-victorian-alp-report-says-one-size-fits-all-campaign-may-have-cost-it-2019-election\">arguing a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach was a key reason for the party\u2019s bruising loss</a>. While not explicitly mentioned in the document, which was prepared by the Victorian branch for the review being conducted by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson, Labor sources familiar with it say it is understood to be in reference to the difficulty the party had over the Adani coalmine. Guardian Australia understands that the submission suggests that individual branches should have more input into the party\u2019s policy development, with one source suggesting that had this been in place before the May election, the Queensland branch may have ensured climate change action was framed as a driver of jobs growth, rather than as a moral issue.</p> <p><strong>The New South Wales opposition has warned of a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d in the state\u2019s planning system</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/08/nsw-hidden-donations-opposition-declares-crisis-of-confidence-in-planning-system\">following revelations that 13 corporations hid their donations from the state\u2019s planning authorities</a>. A Guardian investigation on Monday found some of Australia\u2019s biggest companies \u2013 including Woolworths, Caltex, Origin Energy and AMP \u2013 had failed to declare sizeable donations to planning authorities while seeking to develop or approve property in the state, which is typically considered a criminal offence. NSW Labor\u2019s Adam Searle said the current planning system remained \u201copaque\u201d despite reforms, and allowed \u201cdevelopers and other special interests\u201d to get favourable outcomes by influencing government behind closed doors.</p> <p><strong>Challenges against the election of Josh Frydenberg and Gladys Liu must fail because they do not prove that voters changed their vote after reading controversial Chinese-language signs, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/08/josh-frydenberg-and-gladys-liu-election-challenges-should-be-thrown-out-aec-says\">the Australian Electoral Commission has said</a>. The AEC has asked the federal court to throw out both cases, arguing the petitions do not contain enough detail to overturn the election of the treasurer and deputy Liberal leader in Kooyong, and the Liberal MP in Chisholm. The petitions from the unsuccessful independent candidate for Kooyong, Oliver Yates, and Chisholm constituents Naomi Leslie Hall and Vanessa Claire Garbett complain that Chinese-language signs were likely to mislead voters because they used the AEC\u2019s purple colours and instructed voters that the \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cright\u201d way to vote was to put a 1 next to the Liberal party candidate.</p> <p><strong>Manchester Museum is returning a number of sacred artefacts to Indigenous Australians,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/07/manchester-museum-to-return-artefacts-to-indigenous-australians\">nearly a century after the items came into its possession</a>. The repatriation of 43 ceremonial objects is the first of its kind from the UK under a project to mark the 250th anniversary next year of Captain James Cook\u2019s first voyage to Australia.

In a heroic display of honour, I later offered to apologise to a victim of my idiocy, and then offered my resignation. Now compare my teenage magnanimity with British leader Boris Johnson, who in just two months has lost every vote he\u2019s initiated in the House of Commons, unlawfully suspended parliament and mislead his Queen. Boris is not mortified or ashamed.

It\u2019s contemptible and, coupled with Turkey\u2019s illegal land-grab, it represents the final, miserable collapse of western policy in Syria. It marks the abandonment of any remaining pretence that the US and Europe have the will, the commitment and the humanity to rescue the Syrian people from a murderous regime, make good on the reform promises of the Arab spring, and create a viable path to democratic self-governance.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Stephen Smiley bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 8 October. Top stories Victorian Labor has used a tightly held submission to a review of the May election result to argue for states to have more input into the national campaign, arguing a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach was a key reason for the party\u2019s bruising loss. While not explicitly mentioned in the document, which was prepared by the Victorian branch for the review being conducted by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson, Labor sources familiar with it say it is understood to be in reference to the difficulty the party had over the Adani coalmine. Guardian Australia understands that the submission suggests that individual branches should have more input into the party\u2019s policy development, with one source suggesting that had this been in place before the May election, the Queensland branch may have ensured climate change action was framed as a driver of jobs growth, rather than as a moral issue. The New South Wales opposition has warned of a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d in the state\u2019s planning system following revelations that 13 corporations hid their donations from the state\u2019s planning authorities. A Guardian investigation on Monday found some of Australia\u2019s biggest companies \u2013 including Woolworths, Caltex, Origin Energy and AMP \u2013 had failed to declare sizeable donations to planning authorities while seeking to develop or approve property in the state, which is typically considered a criminal offence. NSW Labor\u2019s Adam Searle said the current planning system remained \u201copaque\u201d despite reforms, and allowed \u201cdevelopers and other special interests\u201d to get favourable outcomes by influencing government behind closed doors. Challenges against the election of Josh Frydenberg and Gladys Liu must fail because they do not prove that voters changed their vote after reading controversial Chinese-language signs, the Australian Electoral Commission has said. The AEC has asked the federal court to throw out both cases, arguing the petitions do not contain enough detail to overturn the election of the treasurer and deputy Liberal leader in Kooyong, and the Liberal MP in Chisholm. The petitions from the unsuccessful independent candidate for Kooyong, Oliver Yates, and Chisholm constituents Naomi Leslie Hall and Vanessa Claire Garbett complain that Chinese-language signs were likely to mislead voters because they used the AEC\u2019s purple colours and instructed voters that the \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cright\u201d way to vote was to put a 1 next to the Liberal party candidate. Manchester Museum is returning a number of sacred artefacts to Indigenous Australians, nearly a century after the items came into its possession. The repatriation of 43 ceremonial objects is the first of its kind from the UK under a project to mark the 250th anniversary next year of Captain James Cook\u2019s first voyage to Australia. The first artefacts will be repatriated in a formal ceremony in November. Mangubadijarri Yanner, a spokesman for the Gangalidda Garawa Native Title Aboriginal Corporation, said the handover was a \u201cfundamental part of the healing and reconciliation process\u201d. World Across the Kurdish-held territories of north-eastern Syria, people are steeling themselves for a long-threatened assault by Turkish forces \u2013 which now seems imminent after Donald Trump withdrew US forces from the area. Meanwhile, Australia has been urged to act quickly to get families out of Syrian refugee camps. The European Union\u2019s devastating point-by-point rejection of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposals has been revealed in documents obtained by the Guardian. The leaked documents lay bare the scale of multiple faults highlighted by the Europeans during recent talks. A federal judge in New York has dismissed Donald Trump\u2019s challenge to a subpoena, and ordered the release of eight years of the president\u2019s tax returns. But Trump\u2019s lawyers immediately appealed, with the second US circuit court of appeals awarding a temporary stay. Indigenous protesters have paralysed roads around Ecuador and blocked a main highway into the capital in a fifth day of action against government austerity measures that have sparked the worst unrest in years, resulting in 477 arrests. Lab-grown meat has been successfully cultured in space for the first time, with an Israeli food technology startup announcing it has grown meat on the International Space Station. Opinion and analysis Unlike the McDonald\u2019s kitchen, democracy is not idiot-proof. But great comedy, and fatigue, follows from the refusal to admit it, writes Martin McKenzie-Murray: \u201cThe McDonald\u2019s kitchen is designed by geniuses to be mastered by children. It\u2019s meant to be idiot-proof. But two months into a job there, I disproved its invulnerability to fools: unsupervised, I threw two frozen meat-cakes on a decommissioned press, shut the lid and prepared the buns. In a heroic display of honour, I later offered to apologise to a victim of my idiocy, and then offered my resignation.

Boris is not mortified or ashamed. He\u2019s not even chastened.\u201d The US withdrawal from northern Syria creates the perfect climate for war crimes, writes Simon Tisdall: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s rash and foolish decision to pull the remaining US ground troops out of north-east Syria is a shocking betrayal of the Kurdish forces that were instrumental in destroying the Islamic State \u2018caliphate\u2019.

However, motions requesting that she stand down were banned by Labour\u2019s regional office on Monday after it emerged the debate on her future was tabled for the start of Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year in Judaism.</p> <p>Lewell-Buck, who has represented South Shields since 2013 when she took over the seat from David Miliband in a byelection, said she has suffered long-standing and well-publicised issues with some members of her CLP.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve an angry cohort of men in the constituency and there\u2019s ongoing complaints in the Labour party about it. It goes back to my selection as MP in the first place \u2013 that I wasn\u2019t the chosen man,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWomen in politics always have a tough job but I think there\u2019s particular areas where there\u2019s been a longstanding culture of misogyny and something the Labour party centrally has been unable to get to the bottom of in South Shields.\u201d</p> <p>The CLP was temporarily suspended three years ago while an investigation was carried out into an alleged culture of bullying.</p> <p>A Labour source said: \u201cAn investigation took place which didn\u2019t find evidence to back up such claims about South Shields, and a wide range of measures have been put in place to support Emma Lewell-Buck and the CLP.\u201d</p> <p>Labour said wider concerns about women MPs facing the trigger process were \u201cbaseless\u201d.</p> <p>About 50 Labour MPs have gone through the selection process so far ahead of an expected general election. About 15 are expected to stand down and those wanting to run again are either being automatically reselected by party members or local party branches have voted to trigger an open selection process.</p> <p>Under rule changes made by the party in 2018 the threshold for open selection battles was cut from 50% to 33% of local branches or affiliated unions within a CLP.</p> <p>Roger Godsiff, MP for Birmingham Hall Green, is the only man to face deselection so far. A Labour source said that suggestions women had been unfairly targeted were without foundation. \u201cThis is baseless. Of the three MPs who have been triggered, one is a man who has been widely condemned for opposing the party\u2019s position on LGBT+ education,\u201d said the source.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing new about trigger ballots. They\u2019ve happened before every general election since 2001. We\u2019re a democratic party and members have the right to have a say in who represents them.\u201d</p> <p>Helen Jones, MP for Warrington North, spoke recently of a \u201cculture of contempt for women\u201d within Labour and that it was \u201cno surprise to anyone\u201d that the first two Labour MPs facing full reselection ballots were female. Labour said her claims about an anti-woman bias were also baseless.</p> <p>Johnson, who has held her Hull North seat since 2005, has complained to the party about how she was deselected and that a local councillor prematurely set up a campaign to take her seat, which is against party rules.</p> <p>She said: \u201cI think at this moment with a national crisis over Brexit and the possibility of a general election shortly it\u2019s a very challenging time to be going through a full open reselection but if that\u2019s what the local party has decided I will get on with it.</p> <p>\u201cI am sure there are a few reasons why this has happened to me but I will now be putting all my energies into campaigning hard to be the Labour candidate at the next general election in Hull North.\u201d</p> <p>Other MPs have said they are far more fearful of reselection after seeing what has happened to colleagues and that the main group under threat appear to be the soft left and those who typically \u201ckeep their heads down\u201d.</p> <p>One admitted missing the party\u2019s conference in Brighton to campaign in the constituency to be reselected as Labour\u2019s candidate instead. Some MPs are still concerned Ellman will face an official trigger ballot at a later date.</p> <p>It emerged on Sunday that the Labour North-West office, which covers Ellman\u2019s seat, wrote to local branches to advise that no confidence motions submitted in the MP should not be discussed because they could prejudice the outcome of a forthcoming trigger ballot. There have been at least two no confidence motions proposed against her.</p> <p>A meeting of the executives of the Riverside CLP has been arranged for Monday night to discuss the regional office\u2019s advice.</p>",

There was confusion on Monday night as to whether South Shields MP Emma Lewell-Buck will have to face an open selection against other candidates to keep her seat after a tied vote at her constituency Labour party (CLP). A fourth woman, Louise Ellman, who is Jewish and the MP for Liverpool Riverside, has been called on by her local party to resign. However, motions requesting that she stand down were banned by Labour\u2019s regional office on Monday after it emerged the debate on her future was tabled for the start of Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year in Judaism. Lewell-Buck, who has represented South Shields since 2013 when she took over the seat from David Miliband in a byelection, said she has suffered long-standing and well-publicised issues with some members of her CLP. \u201cI\u2019ve an angry cohort of men in the constituency and there\u2019s ongoing complaints in the Labour party about it. It goes back to my selection as MP in the first place \u2013 that I wasn\u2019t the chosen man,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen in politics always have a tough job but I think there\u2019s particular areas where there\u2019s been a longstanding culture of misogyny and something the Labour party centrally has been unable to get to the bottom of in South Shields.\u201d The CLP was temporarily suspended three years ago while an investigation was carried out into an alleged culture of bullying. A Labour source said: \u201cAn investigation took place which didn\u2019t find evidence to back up such claims about South Shields, and a wide range of measures have been put in place to support Emma Lewell-Buck and the CLP.\u201d Labour said wider concerns about women MPs facing the trigger process were \u201cbaseless\u201d. About 50 Labour MPs have gone through the selection process so far ahead of an expected general election. About 15 are expected to stand down and those wanting to run again are either being automatically reselected by party members or local party branches have voted to trigger an open selection process. Under rule changes made by the party in 2018 the threshold for open selection battles was cut from 50% to 33% of local branches or affiliated unions within a CLP. Roger Godsiff, MP for Birmingham Hall Green, is the only man to face deselection so far. A Labour source said that suggestions women had been unfairly targeted were without foundation. \u201cThis is baseless. Of the three MPs who have been triggered, one is a man who has been widely condemned for opposing the party\u2019s position on LGBT+ education,\u201d said the source. \u201cThere is nothing new about trigger ballots. They\u2019ve happened before every general election since 2001. We\u2019re a democratic party and members have the right to have a say in who represents them.\u201d Helen Jones, MP for Warrington North, spoke recently of a \u201cculture of contempt for women\u201d within Labour and that it was \u201cno surprise to anyone\u201d that the first two Labour MPs facing full reselection ballots were female. Labour said her claims about an anti-woman bias were also baseless. Johnson, who has held her Hull North seat since 2005, has complained to the party about how she was deselected and that a local councillor prematurely set up a campaign to take her seat, which is against party rules. She said: \u201cI think at this moment with a national crisis over Brexit and the possibility of a general election shortly it\u2019s a very challenging time to be going through a full open reselection but if that\u2019s what the local party has decided I will get on with it. \u201cI am sure there are a few reasons why this has happened to me but I will now be putting all my energies into campaigning hard to be the Labour candidate at the next general election in Hull North.\u201d Other MPs have said they are far more fearful of reselection after seeing what has happened to colleagues and that the main group under threat appear to be the soft left and those who typically \u201ckeep their heads down\u201d. One admitted missing the party\u2019s conference in Brighton to campaign in the constituency to be reselected as Labour\u2019s candidate instead. Some MPs are still concerned Ellman will face an official trigger ballot at a later date. It emerged on Sunday that the Labour North-West office, which covers Ellman\u2019s seat, wrote to local branches to advise that no confidence motions submitted in the MP should not be discussed because they could prejudice the outcome of a forthcoming trigger ballot. There have been at least two no confidence motions proposed against her. A meeting of the executives of the Riverside CLP has been arranged for Monday night to discuss the regional office\u2019s advice.",

      "bodyText": "MPs are calling on Boris Johnson to intervene directly with Donald Trump to prevent the US imposing punitive tariffs of 25% on imported scotch whisky later this month. The US announced last week that scotch would be among a range of European goods subject to hefty import taxes from 18 October, as it hits back against the EU in the long-running trade dispute over subsidies for Airbus. Conor Burns, an international trade minister, responding to an urgent question on the issue from the former Scottish secretary David Mundell, called on the prime minister to tackle Trump about it personally. \u201cI\u2019m sure if the PM was able to convey directly to President Trump the damage that these proposals will do to Scotland, particularly to rural Scotland, that would have an impact,\u201d he said, warning up to 3,000 jobs could be at risk, many of them in rural Scotland. He added: \u201cI want to urge the government to show even more urgency than they have to date.\u201d The World Trade Organization (WTO) has ruled that EU support for Airbus, dating back decades, broke international rules. It announced last week that it would allow the US to impose $7.5bn (\u00a36.1bn) of tariffs in retaliation. Scotch whisky is among the products set to be targeted, along with French wine, Italian and Dutch cheese and Spanish ham. Several Scottish MPs have challenged Burns about what the government was doing to avert the tariffs. Burns, a longtime ally of Johnson\u2019s, said he had not yet spoken directly to the US government, as he had only recently returned from a trade mission to Vietnam, but said he would telephone Washington on Tuesday. At one point he urged MPs to contact the US ambassador themselves. Asked why the UK had not sought an exemption for scotch, Burns said: \u201cWe want to deal with the macro on this. These are very bad tariffs that we believe have no foundation. We believe they are wrong. We believe they are profoundly unhelpful, and we believe they undermine the whole concept of free trade, and will damage people who are producing and employing. \u201cSo I would rather go down the route of trying to persuade our American friends to abandon this entire series of tariff attacks, and look at the issue calmly and reasonably, based on the current facts, not ancient dispute.\u201d He said the the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, had raised the issue with the US vice-president, Mike Pence, and the chancellor, Sajid Javid, had challenged the US treasury secretary about it. He said Johnson was likely to raise it next time he spoke with Trump. Johnson has seemingly struck up a close personal rapport with the US president, who has referred to him as \u201cBritain Trump\u201d, but it has so far yielded few tangible results. All of the governments affected by the ruling, including the UK but also France, Spain, Italy and Germany, have changed the way they support Airbus, but the WTO has yet to confirm whether they were now compliant with the rules. The EU has requested the right to impose tariffs on the US, in a parallel dispute about Washington\u2019s backing for the US aircraft maker Boeing \u2013 with no ruling expected until 2020. Mundell suggested it might help if the UK would commit not to impose import tariffs on American bourbon, in the event of a no-deal Brexit. More details of the government\u2019s planned no-deal tariffs are expected to be published in the coming days. The whisky row came as official government figures revealed that customs declarations after Brexit will cost British businesses \u00a37.5bn a year, \u00a31bn more than previously estimated. In an update to its Brexit impact assessment, HMRC has said the administrative burden on combined UK-EU trade will be double that, at \u00a315bn a year. It also revealed that businesses would effectively be paying \u00a346 and \u00a356 in labour costs per customs declaration because of the detail required. HMRC estimates businesses involved in high volumes of cross-border trade, such as car manufacturers, will spend about one hour and 45 minutes filling out customs declarations forms, at a cost of between \u00a317 for exports and \u00a328 for imports. If companies use specialist freight forward companies the costs rise to between \u00a346 per export to \u00a356 per import.",

      "body": "<p>A star is born. For a couple of months now, the government has been sending emails to casting agents, begging them to find a replacement for Chris Grayling. A minister so useless, so hapless that every appearance in the Commons is guaranteed to be a box office disaster. Many have been called, yet no one has quite come up to scratch. Not even Priti Patel or Liz Truss. Or James Cleverly with his definitive decisiveness graph. AKA My Graph by J Cleverly (aged 11 \u00be). Stupidly on the x-axis and Cleverly on the y-axis \u2013 with next to nothing registering on the y.</p> <p>But James Duddridge, a junior minister in the Brexit department, looks as if he might be the real deal. In this, his second audition standing in for Steve Barclay inside a week, he revealed his true potential. A man for whom practice makes progressively less perfect.</p> <p>The incompetence could be taken as a given \u2013 that\u2019s standard government issue. But what Duddridge brought to his role this time was pure method Grayling. The sense of peevishness that only comes from someone too stupid to realise just how out of their depth they are. The sweaty shiftiness of a man who is dimly aware he is crashing and burning but can\u2019t put his finger on why. It can\u2019t be long before he goes full Grayling and develops a nervous tic. The wobbling cheek was one of the few signs of intelligent life in the former transport secretary.</p> <p>Quite what Duddridge has done to have been thrown under a bus twice in such quick succession is as yet unclear.

      "bodyText": "A star is born. For a couple of months now, the government has been sending emails to casting agents, begging them to find a replacement for Chris Grayling. A minister so useless, so hapless that every appearance in the Commons is guaranteed to be a box office disaster. Many have been called, yet no one has quite come up to scratch. Not even Priti Patel or Liz Truss. Or James Cleverly with his definitive decisiveness graph. AKA My Graph by J Cleverly (aged 11 \u00be). Stupidly on the x-axis and Cleverly on the y-axis \u2013 with next to nothing registering on the y. But James Duddridge, a junior minister in the Brexit department, looks as if he might be the real deal. In this, his second audition standing in for Steve Barclay inside a week, he revealed his true potential. A man for whom practice makes progressively less perfect. The incompetence could be taken as a given \u2013 that\u2019s standard government issue. But what Duddridge brought to his role this time was pure method Grayling. The sense of peevishness that only comes from someone too stupid to realise just how out of their depth they are. The sweaty shiftiness of a man who is dimly aware he is crashing and burning but can\u2019t put his finger on why. It can\u2019t be long before he goes full Grayling and develops a nervous tic. The wobbling cheek was one of the few signs of intelligent life in the former transport secretary. Quite what Duddridge has done to have been thrown under a bus twice in such quick succession is as yet unclear. The chief whip must have some devastating kompromat on him. But at least he\u2019s providing some entertainment at a time of national crisis. He was in the Commons to answer an urgent question from Keir Starmer, requesting the government allow parliament to see the full 44-page legal text of the new withdrawal agreement the EU was in the process of rejecting, rather than just the seven-page summary it had so far been shown.

The watchdog said during its inquiry the detectives could not remember why certain decisions were made and it was not clear whether those in command knew of an earlier complaint from Beech, made to Wiltshire police, which contained inconsistencies compared with what he told the Met two years later.

The Pool of Death. Actually, there were clues this might be an interesting group. If a pool can be known by the strength of its third seed, Japan began as the highest ranked of these. Still, beating the No 1 team in the world was really not supposed to happen. All those beyond Ireland will rejoice that it did. Results such as this, like the one Japan achieved by beating South Africa in 2015, are the clearest indication that rugby\u2019s status quo might be changing.</p> \n<p><strong>What\u2019s still at stake? </strong>So beating the No 9 team in the world ought to be easy. If Japan win the pool stage\u2019s grand finale against Scotland on Sunday, they will top the group, earning them the juicy prospect of a Tokyo quarter-final against South Africa (see Brighton 2015). Assuming Scotland take maximum points against Russia on Wednesday, they must beat Japan to qualify and match Japan for any bonus points.

      "bodyText": "Pool A Story so far Who would have thought it? The Pool of Death. Actually, there were clues this might be an interesting group. If a pool can be known by the strength of its third seed, Japan began as the highest ranked of these. Still, beating the No 1 team in the world was really not supposed to happen. All those beyond Ireland will rejoice that it did. Results such as this, like the one Japan achieved by beating South Africa in 2015, are the clearest indication that rugby\u2019s status quo might be changing. What\u2019s still at stake? So beating the No 9 team in the world ought to be easy. If Japan win the pool stage\u2019s grand finale against Scotland on Sunday, they will top the group, earning them the juicy prospect of a Tokyo quarter-final against South Africa (see Brighton 2015). Assuming Scotland take maximum points against Russia on Wednesday, they must beat Japan to qualify and match Japan for any bonus points. If Japan lose with two bonus points the hosts will still top the group. Meanwhile, Ireland need to beat Samoa. The equally juicy prospect of the All Blacks would await if they qualify behind Japan but they could win the pool if Scotland beat Japan. All three could end level on 15 points, in which case points difference will decide top spot, and the head-to-head between second and third then deciding the runner-up.

Chanting about the climate emergency, frankly, they seemed a bit sheepish, not used to it. Their ordinariness makes Extinction Rebellion, or XR, especially effective: farmers, scientists, doctors, Cumbrians and other local platoons stand at the 12 key roadblocks.</p> \n<p>After their successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/15/thousands-expected-in-london-for-extinction-rebellion-protest\" title=\"\">capture of central London in April</a>, local cells or \u201caffinity groups\u201d all over the country have trained and planned for this protest. Deciding who would be \u201carrestable\u201d for highway obstruction \u2013 and who wouldn\u2019t be, because of jobs or young families \u2013 they were primed to expect a tougher police response after rightwing press complaints against the friendly policing last April, when <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/london/extinction-rebellion-share-video-of-dancing-police/\" title=\"\">officers were caught dancing</a> at a blocked Oxford Circus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/07/extinction-rebellion-new-protests-politicians\">Extinction Rebellion has won the first battle \u2013 now it must win the war | Leo Barasi</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI do wonder if protest makes a difference,\u201d an office manager in her 40s from Hertfordshire said to me. \u201cBut what else can you do? My children really made me feel I must.\u201d A steward in a pink gilet, a mother from south London, said the same: \u201cIt was my children who got me into this.\u201d Thousands more are expected to join.</p> \n<p>For those who doubt the effect of last April\u2019s XR protests, Ben Page of Ipsos Mori says: \u201cIn our polls in 2013, 59% said the planet was \u2018heading for disaster\u2019. This year it\u2019s gone up to 78%.\u201d He reckons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/05/greta-thunberg-developing-world-activists\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a>, the school strikes and XR action played their part. What packs an extra punch is that London is just one of 60 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/07/four-teenage-girls-among-30-arrested-in-sydney-climate-protests\" title=\"\">global cities</a> engaged in \u201cuprising\u201d at the same time. To those who say why bother, when the UK is too small for our carbon emissions to matter, this synchronised global action reaches all those leaders who attended last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/sep/23/greta-thunberg-to-world-leaders-how-dare-you-you-have-stolen-my-dreams-and-my-childhood-video\" title=\"\">UN climate change summit</a> \u2013 where the UN general secretary warned: \u201cWe face a direct existential threat.\u201d </p> \n<p>I think few of these protesters read the rightwing press to know what they\u2019re up against. In a double-page spread in the Mail on Sunday, Douglas Murray, Spectator associate editor and author of Neoconservatism: Why We Need it, launched a blistering attack on climate protesters and soft policing tactics. <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-7541965/DOUGLAS-MURRAY-listen-bunch-anarchists-work-fire-hose.html\" title=\"\">He writes</a>: \u201cTheir refusal to acknowledge any view but their own deranged belief and their defiance of democratic norms is authoritarian, even fascistic \u2026 Despite the childish certainty these extremists promote, the science of climate change is deeply contested.

Never mind the science: what free-market obsessives like Murray can\u2019t bear is that solving the climate crisis requires state and international action. He would rather boil to oblivion, faithful to his free-market creed, than see the planet saved by means he regards as statist or even socialist. \u201cAnarchists\u201d and \u201cwarmed-over communists\u201d demanding \u201cdraconian solutions\u201d, he calls the protesters. His disgust spews out at Thunberg, \u201cthis privileged young girl \u2026 hectoring others on things she barely understands \u2026 delivering unhinged sermons to the credulous global elites\u201d. Among the deadly weapons used against activists is that too many are middle class, and they are all climate hypocrites. Progressives are prone to self-flagellation, but being climate-pure is impossible. Do what you can, cast off the guilt. Murray\u2019s is the blind rage of the losing side. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2019/jul/09/we-cannot-be-radical-enough-david-attenborough-climate-emergency-video\" title=\"\">David Attenborough is believed</a>, not the Mail on Sunday. Even delivery drivers angry at the roadblocks weren\u2019t denying the gravity of the cause. Weekly the news tells of sea ice and glaciers melting, species vanishing, the emergency evident: pollsters find people well understand it and trust the scientists who say humans are the cause.</p> \n<p>Murray accuses XR of wanting to \u201cengineer the complete destruction of the global economic system\u201d. But this highly democratic group is carefully nonprescriptive. All they ask is for politicians to accept the emergency, for a much tighter target than 2050 for net-zero carbon (the UK is already <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/economy/uk-carbon-emissions-targets/\" title=\"\">badly behind</a>, our statutory Committee on Climate Change says) \u2013 and for a citizens assembly, such as President Macron has just set up with a sample group of 150 citizens to advise on how France can cut carbon emissions. That\u2019s the task: finding solutions people will vote for.</p> \n<p>At the party conferences, the Tories barely mentioned climate, while Boris Johnson talks of fuel tax cuts. But Labour puts a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/labour-set-to-commit-to-net-zero-emissions-by-2030\" title=\"\">green industrial strategy</a> at the heart of its spending plans, building renewables in wind and solar, solar panels and insulation for a million social homes, \u00a33.6bn on charging points and free loans for electric cars, nationalising the grid for a vast expansion of 37 offshore wind farms, tidal energy from Swansea Bay and no fracking.</p> \n<p>The UK may be entering a climate culture change that Page compares to the shift in our lifetimes from locking up gay people to a recent poll that found <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/most-britons-would-have-no-concerns-about-royal-same-sex-marriage\" title=\"\">66% would have no concerns</a> about a same-sex marriage in the royal family.

      "bodyText": "In the Mall, up Whitehall, or crossing Trafalgar Square early this morning, the climate activists looked like rush-hour office workers and civil servants \u2013 mainly 30 to 50-year-olds, with no dreadlocked tree-huggers, SWP banners or black-masked anarchists looking for a punch-up. Chanting about the climate emergency, frankly, they seemed a bit sheepish, not used to it. Their ordinariness makes Extinction Rebellion, or XR, especially effective: farmers, scientists, doctors, Cumbrians and other local platoons stand at the 12 key roadblocks. After their successful capture of central London in April, local cells or \u201caffinity groups\u201d all over the country have trained and planned for this protest. Deciding who would be \u201carrestable\u201d for highway obstruction \u2013 and who wouldn\u2019t be, because of jobs or young families \u2013 they were primed to expect a tougher police response after rightwing press complaints against the friendly policing last April, when officers were caught dancing at a blocked Oxford Circus. \u201cI do wonder if protest makes a difference,\u201d an office manager in her 40s from Hertfordshire said to me. \u201cBut what else can you do? My children really made me feel I must.\u201d A steward in a pink gilet, a mother from south London, said the same: \u201cIt was my children who got me into this.\u201d Thousands more are expected to join. For those who doubt the effect of last April\u2019s XR protests, Ben Page of Ipsos Mori says: \u201cIn our polls in 2013, 59% said the planet was \u2018heading for disaster\u2019. This year it\u2019s gone up to 78%.\u201d He reckons Greta Thunberg, the school strikes and XR action played their part. What packs an extra punch is that London is just one of 60 global cities engaged in \u201cuprising\u201d at the same time. To those who say why bother, when the UK is too small for our carbon emissions to matter, this synchronised global action reaches all those leaders who attended last month\u2019s UN climate change summit \u2013 where the UN general secretary warned: \u201cWe face a direct existential threat.\u201d I think few of these protesters read the rightwing press to know what they\u2019re up against. In a double-page spread in the Mail on Sunday, Douglas Murray, Spectator associate editor and author of Neoconservatism: Why We Need it, launched a blistering attack on climate protesters and soft policing tactics. He writes: \u201cTheir refusal to acknowledge any view but their own deranged belief and their defiance of democratic norms is authoritarian, even fascistic \u2026 Despite the childish certainty these extremists promote, the science of climate change is deeply contested. Most scientists agree there are variations going on but they disagree on exactly what causes it.\u201d So that\u2019s where the climate deniers are now, ignoring Nasa\u2019s survey showing 97% of global climate scientists agree that the five warmest years have been the past five, \u201cextremely likely due to human activities\u201d. Never mind the science: what free-market obsessives like Murray can\u2019t bear is that solving the climate crisis requires state and international action. He would rather boil to oblivion, faithful to his free-market creed, than see the planet saved by means he regards as statist or even socialist. \u201cAnarchists\u201d and \u201cwarmed-over communists\u201d demanding \u201cdraconian solutions\u201d, he calls the protesters. His disgust spews out at Thunberg, \u201cthis privileged young girl \u2026 hectoring others on things she barely understands \u2026 delivering unhinged sermons to the credulous global elites\u201d. Among the deadly weapons used against activists is that too many are middle class, and they are all climate hypocrites. Progressives are prone to self-flagellation, but being climate-pure is impossible. Do what you can, cast off the guilt. Murray\u2019s is the blind rage of the losing side. David Attenborough is believed, not the Mail on Sunday. Even delivery drivers angry at the roadblocks weren\u2019t denying the gravity of the cause. Weekly the news tells of sea ice and glaciers melting, species vanishing, the emergency evident: pollsters find people well understand it and trust the scientists who say humans are the cause. Murray accuses XR of wanting to \u201cengineer the complete destruction of the global economic system\u201d. But this highly democratic group is carefully nonprescriptive. All they ask is for politicians to accept the emergency, for a much tighter target than 2050 for net-zero carbon (the UK is already badly behind, our statutory Committee on Climate Change says) \u2013 and for a citizens assembly, such as President Macron has just set up with a sample group of 150 citizens to advise on how France can cut carbon emissions. That\u2019s the task: finding solutions people will vote for. At the party conferences, the Tories barely mentioned climate, while Boris Johnson talks of fuel tax cuts. But Labour puts a green industrial strategy at the heart of its spending plans, building renewables in wind and solar, solar panels and insulation for a million social homes, \u00a33.6bn on charging points and free loans for electric cars, nationalising the grid for a vast expansion of 37 offshore wind farms, tidal energy from Swansea Bay and no fracking. The UK may be entering a climate culture change that Page compares to the shift in our lifetimes from locking up gay people to a recent poll that found 66% would have no concerns about a same-sex marriage in the royal family. Flying, driving, eating beef may go the way of smoking \u2013 but only if the heavy lifting is done by the state. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Visiting Watford, Boris Johnson made it commendably clear on Monday that he opposes the self-interested abuse of a process laid down by treaty and law. Asked about an American spy\u2019s wife who has claimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/07/harry-dunn-crash-pm-to-raise-anne-sacoolas-case-with-white-house\" title=\"\">diplomatic immunity</a> after being involved in the death of a British motorcyclist, Mr Johnson could not, for once, have spoken more plainly. \u201cI must answer you directly,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-49961679\" title=\"\">he said</a>. \u201cI do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.\u201d</p> <p>The remarks were welcome and to the point. But such rigour is rare coming from this prime minister\u2019s mouth. The problem with Mr Johnson\u2019s brief tenure of 10 Downing Street is the exact opposite of the point he made on Monday. He is not a consistent upholder of proper process at all. On the contrary, he is a shameless and serial abuser of it. This week, the damage being done to this country by this most untrustworthy of prime ministers is scattered as far as the eye can see.</p> <p>Only two weeks ago, do not forget, Mr Johnson suffered probably the most humiliating constitutional reprimand ever inflicted on a British prime minister, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/24/supreme-court-judgment-sounds-trumpet-failed-prime-minister\" title=\"\">supreme court</a> unanimously dismissed his five-week prorogation of parliament as unlawful. The judges found that his move breached the principle that a government must be held to account by a sovereign parliament. The embarrassing implication was that Mr Johnson misled the Queen.</p> <p>It is a mark of the unprecedented lack of trust which this prime minister now inspires that a Scottish court was asked on Monday to issue an order requiring him to uphold the law. In Edinburgh the court of session <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/07/court-rejects-latest-request-to-force-pm-to-ask-for-brexit-extension\" title=\"\">declined to issue</a> such an order, which would have ensured compliance with the Benn act\u2019s requirement for a Brexit extension if there is no new deal with the EU on 19 October. But it only did so on the basis that Mr Johnson\u2019s lawyers had pledged in court that he would comply. Not to accept that pledge, the court said, \u201cwould be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown\u201d.</p> <p>On his visit to Watford, the Conservative leader insisted again that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October. This will not be possible, under the Benn act, unless there is a deal in Brussels in under two weeks. That looks unlikely. Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals for a deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/07/no-10-blames-eu-johnson-brexit-plan-fails-to-make-progress\" title=\"\">fall well short</a> of EU positions on multiple counts. President Macron wants everything sorted by Friday. Without an agreement, the Benn act comes into force, compelling Mr Johnson to do what he has always said he will not do. We shall see all too soon if the Scottish court was right to trust Mr Johnson.</p> <p>The signs are not good.

      "bodyText": "Visiting Watford, Boris Johnson made it commendably clear on Monday that he opposes the self-interested abuse of a process laid down by treaty and law. Asked about an American spy\u2019s wife who has claimed diplomatic immunity after being involved in the death of a British motorcyclist, Mr Johnson could not, for once, have spoken more plainly. \u201cI must answer you directly,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.\u201d The remarks were welcome and to the point. But such rigour is rare coming from this prime minister\u2019s mouth. The problem with Mr Johnson\u2019s brief tenure of 10 Downing Street is the exact opposite of the point he made on Monday. He is not a consistent upholder of proper process at all. On the contrary, he is a shameless and serial abuser of it. This week, the damage being done to this country by this most untrustworthy of prime ministers is scattered as far as the eye can see. Only two weeks ago, do not forget, Mr Johnson suffered probably the most humiliating constitutional reprimand ever inflicted on a British prime minister, when the supreme court unanimously dismissed his five-week prorogation of parliament as unlawful. The judges found that his move breached the principle that a government must be held to account by a sovereign parliament. The embarrassing implication was that Mr Johnson misled the Queen. It is a mark of the unprecedented lack of trust which this prime minister now inspires that a Scottish court was asked on Monday to issue an order requiring him to uphold the law. In Edinburgh the court of session declined to issue such an order, which would have ensured compliance with the Benn act\u2019s requirement for a Brexit extension if there is no new deal with the EU on 19 October. But it only did so on the basis that Mr Johnson\u2019s lawyers had pledged in court that he would comply. Not to accept that pledge, the court said, \u201cwould be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown\u201d. On his visit to Watford, the Conservative leader insisted again that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October. This will not be possible, under the Benn act, unless there is a deal in Brussels in under two weeks. That looks unlikely. Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals for a deal fall well short of EU positions on multiple counts. President Macron wants everything sorted by Friday. Without an agreement, the Benn act comes into force, compelling Mr Johnson to do what he has always said he will not do. We shall see all too soon if the Scottish court was right to trust Mr Johnson. The signs are not good. On Tuesday, the government plans to prorogue parliament until a Queen\u2019s speech next Monday. It is true that the 2017-19 session is now the longest since the Long Parliament. But a Queen\u2019s speech normally either follows an election or portends a new legislative programme. This one is the opposite. It coincides with Mr Johnson\u2019s plan to call an election and will thus contain nothing that will reach the statute book before the poll. In effect, as Professor Robert Hazell of the UCL Constitution Unit has argued powerfully, the speech is thus not a legislative programme but an election manifesto. \u201cThe Queen will have been used,\u201d the professor says, \u201cto make a Conservative party political broadcast.\u201d All this is entirely of a piece. Mr Johnson took office in July as head of a Tory faction. He has bulldozed precedent, propriety, parliament, his opponents and the country\u2019s allies with Trumpian disdain. Most have fought back.

A judge ruled that the president\u2019s claim to immunity while in office was \u201crepugnant\u201d and said Manhattan\u2019s district attorney could subpoena eight years of Trump\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns from his accountants, Mazars USA. An appeals court blocked any immediate handover of the records but the escalating court battle leaves Trump with less room for manoeuvre and adds to woes that include a fast-moving impeachment inquiry, which on Monday saw House Democrats issue subpoenas for documents from the Pentagon and the White House budget office. Trump is the first US president in nearly 40 years not to release his tax information, despite having promised to do so during the 2016 campaign. Last month the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, investigating hush money payments to women including the pornographic actor Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election, subpoenaed eight years of Trump\u2019s tax returns. A federal investigation into the hush money led to Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen pleading guilty to campaign finance violations. Trump, who denies Daniels\u2019 claim of a sexual relationship, has claimed any payments were a personal matter, not a campaign expense. The federal investigation wound up in July. Vance, a Democrat, launched a fresh investigation into whether the Trump Organization falsely listed its reimbursement of Cohen for the $130,000 (then \u00a393,000) payment to Daniels as a legal expense.

Trump\u2019s lawyers argue the president is immune from such an investigation while in office and the US constitution requires Vance to wait until after Trump has left the White House. On Monday, the US district judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan described the immunity argument as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and as \u201can overreach of executive power [that was] repugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values\u201d. In a 75-page decision, the judge added: \u201cThe court cannot square a vision of presidential immunity that would place the president above the law.\u201d Despite the impeachment inquiry and a fresh political crisis over Syria, Trump still found time to address the decision on Twitter. \u201cThe Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!\u201d The president\u2019s lawyers immediately appealed to the second US circuit court of appeals, which granted a temporary stay of the ruling \u201cpending expedited review\u201d. Separately, Trump is trying to block Deutsche Bank from handing over financial records, which the bank has said include tax returns and which are sought by multiple House committees. The criminal investigation in New York is unfolding with Trump already under siege from an impeachment inquiry touched off by his efforts to get Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate the former vice-president Joe Biden, a potential opponent at the polls next year. Trump has accused the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, of handing out subpoenas \u201clike cookies\u201d. There was no let up on Monday as Democrats subpoenaed the heads of the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget for documents related to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to freeze aid to Ukraine. Democrats said in a statement: \u201cThe enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the committees to examine this sequence of these events and the reasons behind the White House\u2019s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression.\u201d The deadline to comply is 15 October. Trump has continued to unleash a volley of impetuous tweets, suggesting Pelosi could be guilty of treason. \u201cNancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people,\u201d Trump wrote on Sunday evening, referring to the chairman of the House intelligence committee, whom he has accused of treason. Congress is in recess but the House intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees will continue to hear from witnesses this week. Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, will give his deposition on Tuesday. Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled early, is due to appear on Friday. A lawyer representing the original intelligence community whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment inquiry said on Sunday that a second whistleblower had come forward and spoken to the intelligence community\u2019s internal watchdog, further complicating the president\u2019s case.",

Speaking after Pentland\u2019s ruling, Maugham said the appeal was based on one key question: \u201cWhether the court is right to expect the prime minister to comply with the law.\u201d</p> <p>They will reinforce that argument by also asking the judges to consider taking control of the process by using unique powers available to the inner house, known as<em> nobile officium, </em>which empowers judges to take action in a situation where a remedy is needed.</p> <p>In an unprecedented move, Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the campaigners\u2019 advocate, will ask the court to use their <em>nobile officium</em> powers to write the letter required under the Benn act on Johnson\u2019s behalf if he fails to do so in time.</p> <p>Last Friday, lawyers for the advocate general, the UK government\u2019s Scottish law officer, failed to get that application thrown out.</p> <p>Drummond-Young said the case was unique but it had to be heard soon to ensure it could be properly dealt with, since it was likely to be appealed at the UK supreme court by whichever side loses. The courts had very little time to deal with this, given Brexit day was due on 31 October, he said.</p> <p>To the campaigners\u2019 surprise, Pentland ruled that statements by the prime minister and Downing Street officials that the UK would still leave the EU on 31 October regardless of the Benn act were political statements. Pentland also said the applicants had not proven that Johnson would breach the act by subverting it.</p> <p>At a key point in Friday\u2019s hearing, O\u2019Neill told Pentland that the BBC had just quoted a Downing Street source arguing the Benn act\u2019s \u201cvery specific narrow duty\u201d did not prevent the government from \u201cother communications, private and public\u201d arguing against any delay.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill told the court this was evidence of the government\u2019s \u201cspin, misunderstanding and misinterpretation\u201d of the act. It was proof, he said, that No 10 could not be trusted to honour the promises that government lawyers had given the court.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 October 2019 to correct the names of two of the judges. An earlier version mistakenly said lords Menzies and Turnbull would hear the appeal, rather than lords Carloway and Brodie.</p>",

Pentland refused to grant the three applicants an interdict, or injunction that would force Johnson to obey the act, after the government told the court in writing Johnson accepted \u201che cannot act so as to prevent the letter requesting the specified extension in the act from being sent.\u201d The judge said his decision was reached \u201con the basis that it would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do.\u201d On Tuesday the campaigners\u2019 lawyers will appeal against Pentland\u2019s decision to three judges \u2013 the lord president Lord Carloway, Lord Brodie and Lord Drummond Young \u2013 sitting in the senior inner house of the court of session. The lawyers are expected to argue Pentland was wrong to set aside substantial evidence the government was actively planning to thwart the Benn act. Speaking after Pentland\u2019s ruling, Maugham said the appeal was based on one key question: \u201cWhether the court is right to expect the prime minister to comply with the law.\u201d They will reinforce that argument by also asking the judges to consider taking control of the process by using unique powers available to the inner house, known as nobile officium, which empowers judges to take action in a situation where a remedy is needed. In an unprecedented move, Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the campaigners\u2019 advocate, will ask the court to use their nobile officium powers to write the letter required under the Benn act on Johnson\u2019s behalf if he fails to do so in time. Last Friday, lawyers for the advocate general, the UK government\u2019s Scottish law officer, failed to get that application thrown out. Drummond-Young said the case was unique but it had to be heard soon to ensure it could be properly dealt with, since it was likely to be appealed at the UK supreme court by whichever side loses. The courts had very little time to deal with this, given Brexit day was due on 31 October, he said. To the campaigners\u2019 surprise, Pentland ruled that statements by the prime minister and Downing Street officials that the UK would still leave the EU on 31 October regardless of the Benn act were political statements. Pentland also said the applicants had not proven that Johnson would breach the act by subverting it. At a key point in Friday\u2019s hearing, O\u2019Neill told Pentland that the BBC had just quoted a Downing Street source arguing the Benn act\u2019s \u201cvery specific narrow duty\u201d did not prevent the government from \u201cother communications, private and public\u201d arguing against any delay. O\u2019Neill told the court this was evidence of the government\u2019s \u201cspin, misunderstanding and misinterpretation\u201d of the act. It was proof, he said, that No 10 could not be trusted to honour the promises that government lawyers had given the court. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 October 2019 to correct the names of two of the judges. An earlier version mistakenly said lords Menzies and Turnbull would hear the appeal, rather than lords Carloway and Brodie.",

Dexter Bristol, 58, died in March 2018 after collapsing in the street. Heart problems were found to be the medical cause of his death. The coroner, Mary Hassell, considered at a hearing at St Pancras coroner\u2019s court on Monday whether the problems Bristol had had with the Home Office in the final year of his life trying to prove his right to live in the UK contributed to his death. His mother, Sentina D\u2019Artagnan Bristol, said in that year he was under enormous stress from the Home Office caused by having to try to prove he was British. Bristol\u2019s case emerged as part of the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the Windrush scandal, which highlighted the damaging impact of the Home Office\u2019s hostile environment policy on many individuals. Bristol, who moved from Grenada to the UK in 1968 when he was eight, was sacked from his cleaning job in 2017 because he had no passport. He was denied benefits because officials did not believe he was in the country legally. Until he was sacked, he had no idea there was any problem with his immigration status. He feared being deported after he was told he had no right to live and work in the UK. Two medical experts differed on the role the stress he was under may have played in his death. Prof Jaswinder Singh Gill, a consultant cardiologist, told the inquest \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure stress was a factor\u201d contributing to Bristol\u2019s death. However, the pathologist Dr Alan Bates, told the court he did not believe that stress was a causative factor in the death. Mark Pembroke, from the employment agency Maximus, said in a statement read out in court that Bristol had problems with obtaining the evidence the Home Office required to prove he had a right to live in the UK. \u201cNothing appeared to be moving quickly enough to allow him to gain employment,\u201d he said. \u201cHe felt he was going round in circles. It made him feel like a criminal but he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. I could see Dexter was unravelling. It was a slow, gradual decline.\u201d His immigration lawyer, Jacqueline McKenzie, of McKenzie, Beute and Pope, had worked with him in the 10 months before his death to help him try to regularise his status. She told the court she saw him decline in the months before his death. \u201cHe kept saying \u2018I\u2019m British\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cDexter said that in May 2017 he had spoken to the Home Office and they had said to him that he was not British and had no right to be in the UK.\u201d She said his biggest anxiety was that he might lose his benefits including housing benefit, which would result in him losing his home. \u201cHe was always very sad,\u201d she told the court. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t believe this was going to be resolved.\u201d Najmin Syed, a senior policy adviser in the Home Office\u2019s nationality and settlement casework team, said the Windrush scandal had led to the Home Office adopting a more \u201ccommonsense\u201d approach in cases like Bristol\u2019s. When the coroner asked her what had changed in terms of the requirements for Windrush generation people applying to regularise their status she said that the key requirements of proving identity and residence in the UK since 1 January 1973 remained but the Home Office was adopting a \u201cmore customer proactive approach\u201d. The coroner said Bristol had died of natural causes although he was suffering from various stresses before his death. She did not find that the Home Office\u2019s hostile environment was a contributory factor in his death. Speaking after the inquest his mother condemned the coroner\u2019s conclusions. \u201cJustice has not been done,\u201d she said. \u201cDexter was going through a lot of stress because of the Home Office and I believe it was those stresses that brought on his collapse and death.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For anybody who has their home on the market, the news from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/07/uk-house-price-growth-halifax-brexit\">Halifax</a> that property prices fell in September would not have come as an earth-shattering surprise. Perhaps more of a shock is that the UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lender is still reporting that prices are up on the year, albeit modestly. It certainly doesn\u2019t feel that way.</p> <p>The last time house-price inflation was as low as 1.1% was in 2013 and back then the government took swift action. Lenders received incentives to lend to those buying a home, while the help-to-buy scheme from the Treasury boosted demand by helping potential buyers get on the housing ladder.</p> <p>When combined with ultra-low interest rates and the money-creation scheme known as quantitative easing, Whitehall subsidies were enough to turbo charge the market. Activity and prices both rose sharply. There are reports that the chancellor, Sajid Javid, is looking at new ways to revive a flat market, with a cut in stamp duty seen as the likeliest option.</p> <p>Politically, this looks smart but it would actually be a big mistake. Objectively, the conditions are in place for a booming housing market. Unemployment is low, official interest rates are at 0.75% and lenders are offering all sorts of juicy deals to secure market share. The fact that this is still a buyers\u2019 market means that prices are too high and need to come down. That, rather than the Brexit deadline, is why activity continues to be weak.</p> <p>For twenty- and thirtysomethings still living at home with their parents, a prolonged period when wages are rising faster than house prices is entirely welcome because it makes property more affordable. If the government insists on intervening in the property market it should do so by increasing the supply of homes rather than by artificially boosting demand.</p> <h2>Much ado about pizza</h2> <p>To misquote Harold Wilson, a weekend is a long time in business. On Friday, reports surfaced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/07/pizza-express-lining-up-for-painful-debt-restructuring\">Pizza Express </a>was in the early stages of talks to refinance its debts. By Monday, there were rumours that the company was fighting for its survival and customers were taking to Twitter expressing their horror at the notion that it might be going the way of Jamie Oliver\u2019s Jamie\u2019s Italian.</p> <p>Hang on a minute, though. Yes, it\u2019s true that business could be better for Pizza Express. Along with the rest of the casual dining sector, it is operating at a time when consumers are reluctant to flash the cash. Yes, it\u2019s also true that it paid out the thick end of \u00a3100m in interest payments last year and has big debt repayments due in 2021 and 2022.</p> <p>But debt piles and hefty interest payments are not exactly rare these days. Pizza Express was subject to a private equity buy out by a Chinese company Hony Capital in 2014, and the private equity model involves loading companies up with debt.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say Pizza Express is trouble free. Its bonds would not be trading at below their issue price if everything was going swimmingly. Firms don\u2019t hire expensive financial advisers just for the fun of it.</p> <p>But Pizza Express has a solid business model that has lasted the test of time. That makes it different from Jamie\u2019s Italian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>It\u2019s politics before economics for Merkel</h2> <p>Do you really want to risk a no-deal Brexit at a time when your economy is in such poor shape? That, no doubt, would have been the message from Boris Johnson to Angela Merkel had the German chancellor been able to find a slot in her diary for a face-to-face meeting with the prime minister this week.</p> <p>Recent data from Europe\u2019s biggest economy has indeed been dire. The latest dollop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/oct/07/slowdown-fears-german-factory-orders-stock-markets-investors-eurozone-business-live?page=with:block-5d9ad5778f084ab841733f60#block-5d9ad5778f084ab841733f60\">bad news </a>\u2013 a 6.7% fall in factory orders \u2013 leaves Germany teetering on the brink of recession. This is not a good time for BMW, Siemens or Bosch and a no-deal Brexit will make matters worse.</p> <p>Yet while Merkel is rightly worried about the economy, she is not worried enough to put pressure on fellow EU leaders to accept Johnson\u2019s proposals as the basis of a deal. For now, politics matters more than economics.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For anybody who has their home on the market, the news from the Halifax that property prices fell in September would not have come as an earth-shattering surprise. Perhaps more of a shock is that the UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lender is still reporting that prices are up on the year, albeit modestly. It certainly doesn\u2019t feel that way. The last time house-price inflation was as low as 1.1% was in 2013 and back then the government took swift action. Lenders received incentives to lend to those buying a home, while the help-to-buy scheme from the Treasury boosted demand by helping potential buyers get on the housing ladder. When combined with ultra-low interest rates and the money-creation scheme known as quantitative easing, Whitehall subsidies were enough to turbo charge the market. Activity and prices both rose sharply. There are reports that the chancellor, Sajid Javid, is looking at new ways to revive a flat market, with a cut in stamp duty seen as the likeliest option. Politically, this looks smart but it would actually be a big mistake. Objectively, the conditions are in place for a booming housing market. Unemployment is low, official interest rates are at 0.75% and lenders are offering all sorts of juicy deals to secure market share. The fact that this is still a buyers\u2019 market means that prices are too high and need to come down. That, rather than the Brexit deadline, is why activity continues to be weak. For twenty- and thirtysomethings still living at home with their parents, a prolonged period when wages are rising faster than house prices is entirely welcome because it makes property more affordable. If the government insists on intervening in the property market it should do so by increasing the supply of homes rather than by artificially boosting demand. Much ado about pizza To misquote Harold Wilson, a weekend is a long time in business. On Friday, reports surfaced that Pizza Express was in the early stages of talks to refinance its debts. By Monday, there were rumours that the company was fighting for its survival and customers were taking to Twitter expressing their horror at the notion that it might be going the way of Jamie Oliver\u2019s Jamie\u2019s Italian. Hang on a minute, though. Yes, it\u2019s true that business could be better for Pizza Express. Along with the rest of the casual dining sector, it is operating at a time when consumers are reluctant to flash the cash. Yes, it\u2019s also true that it paid out the thick end of \u00a3100m in interest payments last year and has big debt repayments due in 2021 and 2022. But debt piles and hefty interest payments are not exactly rare these days. Pizza Express was subject to a private equity buy out by a Chinese company Hony Capital in 2014, and the private equity model involves loading companies up with debt. That\u2019s not to say Pizza Express is trouble free. Its bonds would not be trading at below their issue price if everything was going swimmingly. Firms don\u2019t hire expensive financial advisers just for the fun of it. But Pizza Express has a solid business model that has lasted the test of time. That makes it different from Jamie\u2019s Italian. It\u2019s politics before economics for Merkel Do you really want to risk a no-deal Brexit at a time when your economy is in such poor shape? That, no doubt, would have been the message from Boris Johnson to Angela Merkel had the German chancellor been able to find a slot in her diary for a face-to-face meeting with the prime minister this week. Recent data from Europe\u2019s biggest economy has indeed been dire. The latest dollop of bad news \u2013 a 6.7% fall in factory orders \u2013 leaves Germany teetering on the brink of recession. This is not a good time for BMW, Siemens or Bosch and a no-deal Brexit will make matters worse. Yet while Merkel is rightly worried about the economy, she is not worried enough to put pressure on fellow EU leaders to accept Johnson\u2019s proposals as the basis of a deal. For now, politics matters more than economics.",

Aidan O\u2019Neill was the diamond in Central Coast\u2019s 2019-20 roughery, Brad Inman and George Mells could prove handy, while after an injury-ravaged last season Stefan Mauk is as good as a new signing.</p> <p>The massive variable is Fowler\u2019s foreign legion.

      "bodyText": "After a period of stagnation, the A-League has set rancorous in-fighting over governance behind it and welcomed a first new club to the mix since 2012-13. A lack of marketing fanfare may have engendered a \u201csoft launch\u201d feel but with the winter codes finished things should quickly heat up. Western United will energise Melbourne fans, while the arrival of Robbie Fowler in Queensland could be the biggest thing to unite Brisbane since the Story Bridge.

Verbeek has the firm foundations laid by Marco Kurz to build on during his first taste of the A-League. Under their former boss United were solid defensively and hardworking around the ground, but they lacked a cutting edge up front. That problem does not appear to have been rectified conclusively in the transfer window, and not helped by the departure of Craig Goodwin, last season\u2019s top scorer. Even more significantly the Reds have lost their on-field talisman Isaias, one of the most influential leaders in the league during his six-year stint in South Australia. The list of recruits is short with Micha\u00ebl Maria and Kristian Opseth headlining the international signings, while Riley McGree\u2019s return ensures the Reds boast one of the country\u2019s brightest midfield prospects. In the short-term, a home FFA Cup final could provide an early season boost. Looking further down the track, the decision to bring former stars Bruce Djite, Carl Veart and Eugene Galekovic into the fold suggests the club\u2019s football department is in safe hands.

After an utterly abject 2018-19 the club has undergone wholesale change \u2013 a clean broom through the dressing room and the backroom too, with the well-known but simultaneously unknown \u201cmarquee manager\u201d Robbie Fowler taking the reins. It could go spectacularly right. It could also go incredibly wrong. In the positives column they have snaffled a proven A-League goalscorer. With 39 goals in 78 A-League starts, Roy O\u2019Donovan is your literal one-in-two striker every team craves. Moreover, he could prove the perfect foil for rising star Dylan Wenzel-Halls, the unequivocal bright light amid last season\u2019s drudgery. In midfield especially, Roar look solid. Aidan O\u2019Neill was the diamond in Central Coast\u2019s 2019-20 roughery, Brad Inman and George Mells could prove handy, while after an injury-ravaged last season Stefan Mauk is as good as a new signing. The massive variable is Fowler\u2019s foreign legion. Centre-back Tom Aldred has been handed the armband so should be sound, and if Aaron Amadi-Holloway, Macauley Gillesphey and Jay O\u2019Shea fire, this team could be very competitive. If they flop though, it could be one of the worst collective use of visa spots the league has seen. On top of all this, the Bakries remain.

Coach Alen Stajcic put aside his own tumultuous year to steady the ship; now we find out whether his off-season recruitment and pre-season planning have been up to scratch to make the Mariners competitive once again. Mark Birighitti is a massive in. They either do keepers brilliantly or awfully in Gosford, and the one-time Premier League signing could prove to be worth at least five to 10 points. The prodigiously talented Danny De Silva needs to stamp his mark on the A-League. This is the season to do it. While Giancarlo Gallifuoco, Dylan Fox and Sam Silvera are talented locals who could blossom with regular football. Ziggy Gordon, Milan Duric and Kim Eun-sun bring much-needed experience, but there\u2019s still the feeling this squad is desperately short up-front.

(JP) Newcastle Jets Ins: Abdiel Arroyo (Arabe Unido \u2013 loan), Bobby Burns (Hearts \u2013 loan), Nick Fitzgerald (Western Sydney Wanderers), Wes Hoolahan (West Bromwich Albion), Matthew Millar (Central Coast Mariners) Outs: Jake Adelson, Kwabena Appiah-Kubi, Joey Champness (hip-hop), Nick Cowburn, Daniel Georgievski (Western Sydney Wanderers), Jair, Roy O\u2019Donovan (Brisbane), Ronald Vargas, Ivan Vujica (Western United) There is reason to be worried about Newcastle Jets this season. Roy O\u2019Donovan has flown the coop, Daniel Georgievski and Ronnie Vargas are massive outs, and even rising talent Joey Champness reckons his future is on the mic. Dimi Petratos could cut an increasingly forlorn attacking presence upfront \u2013 especially with the news that star recruit Wes Hoolahan could be out for the best part of half a season due to injury. The ever-wily Merrick may have a late transfer up his sleeve, but there\u2019s a lurking suspicion with a few loan deals and free transfers the only business done so far that owner Martin Lee\u2019s precarious financial situation might limit the veteran coach\u2019s options. The back seven will remain relatively solid, but the front four remain a huge concern. Let\u2019s hope Abdiel Arroyo can bring Pana-mania to the A-League, not seen since his similarly alliterative countryman Yairo Yau. Otherwise beating the Mariners might be the only joy for the faithful this campaign. (RP) Perth Glory Ins: Nicholas D\u2019Agostino (Brisbane Roar), Bruno Fornaroli (Melbourne City), Dane Ingham (Brisbane Roar), Kim Soo-beom (Jeju United), Osama Malik (Al-Batin), James Meredith (Millwall), Jacob Tratt (Sydney FC), Riley Warland (Fulham), Gregory W\u00fcthrich (Young Boys) Outs: Jason Davidson (Ulsan Hyundai), Fabio Ferreira (Adelaide City), Jacob Italiano (Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach), Andy Keogh (Al-Qadsia), Shane Lowry (Al Ahli), Scott Neville (Brisbane Roar), Brendon Santalab (retired), Walter Scott (Wellington Phoenix) Last season\u2019s premiers boast a squad full of depth and character, a first XI to rival anybody\u2019s, and a coach with a proven winning formula. Perth Glory will be near the top again in 2019-20. It\u2019s a testament to the Glory administration that departures as potentially painful as Andy Keogh and Jason Davidson have been salved by the recruitment of Bruno Fornaroli and James Meredith, while the loss of Shane Lowry simply means more minutes for Tomi Mrcela. The Asian Champions League campaign could throw a spanner in the works after Christmas, especially with a squad containing so many players nearer the end of their careers than the start, but that\u2019s nit-picking for a side that displays no obvious weak links, be it in personnel or tactics. (JP) Sydney FC Ins: Kosta Barbarouses (Melbourne Victory), Alexander Baumjohann (Western Sydney Wanderers), Luke Brattan (Melbourne City), Patrick Flottmann (Air Force United), Ryan McGowan (Bradford City) Outs: Mitch Austin, Josh Brillante (Melbourne City), Alex Brosque (retired), Aaron Calver (Western United), Alex Cisak, Siem De Jong (Ajax \u2013 loan return), Daniel De Silva (Central Coast Mariners \u2013 loan return), Cameron Devlin (Wellington Phoenix), Reza Ghoochanneljhad (APOEL), Jacob Tratt (Perth Glory), Jop van der Linden (retired) A picture of quiet rejuvenation the last three seasons, Sydney FC have been the most consistent in their recruitment, and despite a few big name outs, the business they\u2019ve done has not only improved the squad, but been a finger in the eye to several of their rivals. Retiring skipper Alex Brosque was always going to leave a hole, but with the signings of Kosta Barbarouses and Alexander Baumjohann they\u2019ve more than able replaced the 35-year-old, as well as the injured-plagued Siem De Jong. Moreover, they\u2019ve also already lit the sky blue touchpaper on the Sydney derby and the Big Blue \u2013 look forward to those. Josh Brillante for Luke Brattan is a high pedigree trade, while the return to Australia of Ryan McGowan is more than a handy replacement for last season\u2019s rare flop, Dutchman Jop van der Linden. With the back office stable and the academy starting to produce consistent young talent, it bodes as another good season for Sydney. And that\u2019s before you even mention Milo\u0161 Ninkovi\u0107 and Adam Le Fondre. (RP) Wellington Phoenix Ins: David Ball (Rotherham United), Ulises Davila (Delhi Dynamos), Luke DeVere (Brisbane Roar), Cameron Devlin (Sydney FC), Te Atawhai Hudson-Wihongi (Auckland City), Stefan Marinovic (Bristol City), Callum McCowatt (Eastern Suburbs), Liam McGing (Sutherland Sharks), Tim Payne (Eastern Suburbs), Reno Piscopo (Renate), Walter Scott (Perth Glory), Jaushua Sotirio (Western Sydney Wanderers), Matti Steinmann (Hamburg SV) Outs: Max Burgess (Western United), Nathan Burns, Tom Doyle, Andrew Durante (Western United), Anthony Golec, Justin Gulley, Michal Kopczynski, Roy Krishna (ATK), Filip Kurto (Western United), Ryan Lowry, Mandi, Cillian Sheridan, Sarpreet Singh (Bayern Munich II), Gianni Stensness (Central Coast Mariners), David Williams (ATK) Nobody gave Mark Rudan\u2019s rag-tag gang much of a chance last season; nobody will fancy his good friend Ufuk Talay\u2019s mob this season either. And yet across the ditch there\u2019s a quiet confidence to Phoenix\u2019s off-season recruitment. Matti Steinmann and Ulises Davila come with a pedigree that could take the league by storm, while David Ball is the kind of hardworking striker that thrives in the A-League. And yet. There\u2019s one cavern-sized hole the Phoenix haven\u2019t \u2013 and in truth \u2013 might never replace: Roy Krishna. A genuine x-factor, the Johnny Warren medallist could single-handedly turn a contest. Take out David Williams, the mercurial Sarpreet Singh, Max Burgess and the best keeper in the league, Filip Kurto, and last season\u2019s heroics may be hard to repeat. Australian fans may not be familiar with Stefan Marinovic, but the All Whites keeper is the real deal. If fit, Luke DeVere could form a tough-as-teak centre pairing with new skipper Steven Taylor, while Callum McCowatt and Reno Piscopo are genuine talents. A marquee striker is allegedly on his way: fingers crossed for that. They\u2019re down 35 goals from Krishna, Williams and Singh \u2013 they\u2019ll have to come from somewhere. (RP) Western Sydney Wanderers Ins: Daniel Georgievski (Newcastle Jets), Matthew Jurman (Al-Ittihad), Daniel Lopar (St. Gallen), Rados\u0142aw Majewski (Pogo\u0144 Szczecin), Dylan McGowan (Vendsyssel), Alexander Meier (FC St. Pauli), Pirmin Schwegler (Hannover 96), Nick Sullivan (Cova da Piedade) Outs: Alexander Baumjohann (Sydney FC), Roly Bonevacia (Al-Faisaly FC), Mark Bridge (retired), Nick Fitzgerald (Newcastle Jets), Giancarlo Gallifuoco (Central Coast Mariners), Brendan Hamill (Western United), Raul Llorente (released), Rashid Mahazi (Incheon United), Abraham Majok (Central Coast Mariners), Oriol Riera (CF Fuenlabrada), Josh Risdon (Western United), Jaushua Sotirio (Wellington Phoenix), Marc Tokich (released) Markus Babbel has overhauled the squad that so disappointed during his debut season as coach ahead of a decisive campaign for Western Sydney Wanderers. After three years without a home the Wanderers can finally enjoy the spectacular Bankwest Arena and with it the raucous home support that provided the soundtrack to the club\u2019s early successes \u2013 that is if Babbel can entice fans back after poor form and unsatisfactory temporary homes drove plenty away. Recruitment had to focus on defence and in Daniel Lopar, Daniel Georgievski, Matt Jurman and Dylan McGowan dramatic improvements have been made, while Pirmin Schwegler offers the experienced foil the promising Keanu Baccus requires to flourish in the centre of midfield. In contrast to last season, Babbel\u2019s headaches may now come in the final third following the departure of Alex Baumjohann and the long-term injury to his replacement Rados\u0142aw Majewski robbing him of an obvious playmaker. Nonetheless, a much stronger Wanderers \u2013 and a push for the finals \u2013 must be expected. (JP) Western United Ins: Filip Kurto (Wellington Phoenix), Aaron Calver (Sydney FC), Brendan Hamill (Western Sydney Wanderers), Andrew Durante (Wellington Phoenix), Dylan Pierias (Melbourne City), Connor Chapman (Pohang Steelers), Valentino Yuel (Bentleigh Greens), Panagiotis Kone (Udinese), Apostolos Stamatelopoulos (Adelaide United), Scott McDonald (Partick Thistle), Connor Pain (Central Coast Mariners), Dario Jertec (Vara\u017edin), Ivan Vujica (Newcastle Jets), Max Burgess (Wellington Phoenix), Jonathan Aspropotamitis (Central Coast Mariners), Joshua Cavallo (Melbourne City), Josh Risdon (Western Sydney Wanderers), James Delianov (Melbourne City), Sebastian Pasquali (Ajax), Ersan G\u00fcl\u00fcm (Whittlesea United), Alessandro Diamanti (Livorno), Besart Berisha (Sanfrecce Hiroshima) The A-League\u2019s newest club have nothing to lose in their opening campaign, and their mere presence has put a spring in the step of the football community. Their true potential will not be realised until their standalone stadium has been built, but there are grounds for optimism before then. Under the direction of Steve Horvat and Lou Sticca, Western United have snapped up the most impressive young Australian manager going around and handed him a squad with the building blocks for immediate results. There\u2019s experience and character in the likes of Andrew Durante, Ersan G\u00fcl\u00fcm and Scott McDonald, international class in the shape of Alessandro Diamanti and Panagiotis Kone, proven A-League quality in Filip Kurto, Josh Risdon and Besart Berisha, and a sprinkling of exciting youngsters with Seb Pasquali, Dylan Pierias and Apostolos Stamatelopoulos all stars in the making. Ups and downs are inevitable in a debut season, but on paper at least Western United have the raw materials to hold their own from the get-go. (JP)",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales opposition has warned of a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d in the state\u2019s planning system following revelations that 13 corporations hid their donations from the state\u2019s planning authorities. A Guardian investigation on Monday found some of Australia\u2019s biggest companies \u2013 including Woolworths, Caltex, Origin Energy and AMP \u2013 had failed to declare sizeable donations to planning authorities while seeking to develop or approve property in the state. Failing to declare such donations is typically considered a criminal offence, and companies like Optus and AGL have previously been prosecuted, convicted and fined for small, inadvertent disclosure failures. The shadow planning minister, Adam Searle, said the current planning system remained \u201copaque\u201d despite reforms, and allowed \u201cdevelopers and other special interests\u201d to get favourable outcomes by influencing government behind closed doors. \u201cIs it any wonder there is a crisis of confidence in the NSW planning system?\u201d Searle said. \u201cAll corporate donations to political parties should be transparent and declared in accordance with the law. Labor has gone further by proposing a ban on property developers being allowed to sit in cabinet and we know there is a need to work with the parliament on more reforms.\u201d \u201cAll donations to political parties made by corporations should be disclosed specifically to planning authorities when planning approvals are sought.\u201d The planning minister, Rob Stokes, was approached for comment. The NSW government has taken steps to improve donation transparency in the planning system. The planning department now conducts annual audits of donation disclosures, and has improved the process used by applicants to disclose political donations to prevent inadvertent failings. The government has also introduced an ethics unit to improve confidence in the planning system, and reformed the composition of planning panels to reduce corruption risks. The donations in question were declared to electoral authorities, as required. But NSW law requires they also be declared to the planning department, so that it can be fully aware of attempts at political influence by an applicant. Former anti-corruption commissioner and NSW judge Anthony Whealy QC said the law was important because it \u201ccreates a heightened transparency around the entire planning process\u201d. \u201cIt identifies potential conflicts of interest for those involved in the approval process and provides a public check on the undue influence of money in relation to planning decisions,\u201d Whealy said in a piece for the Guardian. \u201cBut in numerous instances these important laws appear to have been ignored. The number and extent of the transgressions uncovered by the Guardian is alarming.\u201d Whealy said he suspected the laws were often being ignored and questioned whether the department was \u201cfalling down on its task of catching out corporations and individuals who have failed to make timely and accurate disclosure\u201d. Property developer donations have caused huge difficulty for both sides of politics in NSW, but particularly Labor. NSW Labor is currently mired in an Independent Commission Against Corruption hearing into its acceptance of $100,000 in cash from property developer and Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo. The undeclared donations were found by cross-checking planning records against donations. Woolworths appeared to have made the most omissions. It failed to declare more than $100,000 in donations to the NSW Liberals and Nationals while seeking to secure minor approvals for a supermarket at Mullumbimby, near Byron Bay. The company has since referred itself to the planning department. \u201cWhile we fully disclosed historical political donations to the NSW Electoral Commission as required, it would appear that parts of our business which manage planning applications were regrettably not aware of these disclosures,\u201d the company said. The planning department said it would investigate the findings shared by the Guardian, and take action where warranted.",

      "bodyText": "Challenges against the election of Josh Frydenberg and Gladys Liu must fail because they do not prove that voters changed their vote after reading controversial Chinese-language signs, the Australian Electoral Commission has said. The AEC has asked the federal court to throw out both cases, arguing the petitions do not contain enough detail to overturn the election of the treasurer and deputy Liberal leader in Kooyong and the Liberal MP in Chisholm. The petitions to the court from the unsuccessful independent candidate for Kooyong, Oliver Yates, and Chisholm constituents Naomi Leslie Hall and Vanessa Claire Garbett complain that Chinese-language signs were likely to mislead voters because they used the AEC\u2019s purple colours and instructed voters the \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cright\u201d way to vote was to put a 1 next to the Liberal party candidate. Frydenberg and Liu have claimed the Liberal party\u2019s acting Victorian director, Simon Frost, \u201cintended\u201d the signs to say \u201cto make your vote count put a 1 next to the Liberal candidate\u201d but admit the translation meant \u201ccorrect way to vote\u201d, \u201ccorrect voting method\u201d or \u201cthe right way to vote\u201d. In near-identical responses to both cases, the AEC told the court that the \u201cpetition fails to set out at all, let alone with sufficient particularity, any facts or matters on the basis of which it might be concluded that it was likely that on polling day, electors able to read Chinese characters, upon seeing and reading the corflute, cast their vote in a manner different from what they had previously intended\u201d. The AEC admitted that \u201cit is possible\u201d that votes in Chisholm and Kooyong were cast by electors who read the Chinese signs or were told about them by someone who had read the signs. But it said the petitions failed to set out \u201cthe facts or matters on the basis of which the petitioner alleges that it is likely\u201d that people then voted number 1 for or gave their preference to Liu or Frydenberg \u201cnotwithstanding that such was not the vote that they otherwise intended to cast\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It submitted the petitions failed to comply with section 355 of the Electoral Act \u2013 which requires facts to be detailed with \u201csufficient particularity\u201d \u2013 and that as a result the cases should not be heard, citing section 358 which allows a court to throw a case out for technical failures or allow it to be heard despite some missing detail. The AEC raised the same technical objection in relation to paragraphs of the petitions claiming that the two candidates\u2019 preferred results were \u201clikely to have been affected\u201d by the signs. The AEC responses admit that on election day, 18 May, it formed the view the Chinese-language signs did not breach the provision banning publications which are \u201clikely to mislead an elector in relation to the casting of a vote\u201d and so did not order them to be taken down. It explained that the provision bans misleading voters with respect to \u201cthe act of recording or expressing the political judgment which an elector has made rather than the formation of that judgment\u201d. Yates, Hall and Garbett argue that by instructing voters on the \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cright\u201d way to vote, the signs implied that a vote for anyone other than the Liberal candidate would be invalid and they therefore did meet this higher threshold.

      "bodyText": "Victorian Labor has used a tightly held submission to a review of the May election result to argue for states to have more input into the national campaign, arguing a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach was a key reason for the party\u2019s bruising election loss. Labor sources familiar with a submission prepared by the Victorian branch for the review being conducted by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson say it is understood to focus on the national campaign\u2019s failure to broach the differences between the states as part of its overall messaging. The branch is advocating for each state to have more say in the strategies and policies that are developed and taken to an election, rather than having policies developed in Canberra and \u201cfarmed out\u201d to the states to sell in a campaign. While not explicitly mentioned in the submission, the complaint is understood to be in reference to the difficulty the party had over the Adani coalmine as it sought to balance the concerns of blue-collar workers, particularly in the mining industry, and progressive voters in inner-city areas. Guardian Australia understands that the submission suggests individual branches have more input into the party\u2019s policy development to ensure no state is \u201cexposed\u201d by a particular policy as a result. One source suggested that had this been in place before the May election, the Queensland branch may have enforced a different policy on the Adani coalmine and ensured climate change action was framed as a driver of jobs growth rather than a moral issue. Another suggested that because of the desire to minimise the risk of leaks, the state branches were largely kept in the dark about policies until they were announced nationally. Details of the submission come after the former leader Bill Shorten took responsibility for the election loss, saying he acknowledged the party\u2019s tax policies, particularly on franking credits, had allowed for an effective scare campaign against a change of government. He also expressed regret that federal Labor was not seen as fighting for working people. \u201cIt pains me to realise after the election that I\u2019d misread some of the mood in Queensland and Western Australia. There they saw some of our policies as being green-left, not for the worker, not for working people,\u201d Shorten said on Sunday. \u201cThat pains me because I\u2019ve spent my adult life standing up for working-class people, standing up for workers, standing up for a better deal for them. I was at Beaconsfield (mine) but it pains me to realise at the last election our presentation meant that some people felt we weren\u2019t putting jobs first and foremost in everything we did.\u201d The May election saw Labor\u2019s primary vote slump to 26.68% in Queensland and 29.8% in WA, with the party bleeding support to One Nation and Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia Party in traditional working-class areas. Nationally, the primary vote of 33.3% was Labor\u2019s worst result in 85 years. In Victoria, Labor secured 36.86% of the primary vote and won the seats of Corangamite and Dunkley, which had been made notionally Labor by a redistribution. Ahead of the election, party strategists had been confident that Labor could pick up a handful of additional seats in Victoria that would make up for the lack of any gains in Queensland. The party was also hopeful of winning up to three seats from the Coalition in WA, but swings did not eventuate. On Monday the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said he believed the mea culpa from Shorten was \u201cappropriate\u201d, but said he also accepted \u201ccollective responsibility\u201d for the result. He said that the party was listening to the concerns of Queenslanders, and pledged to do \u201cmuch better\u201d at the next election. \u201cWe have to start right here in Queensland, we need to do better in Western Australia, we need to do better in our outer suburbs and in our regions, and I am determined to put forward a positive agenda for Labor.\u201d Albanese said that Labor recognised the \u201cscale of the defeat\u201d suffered at the 18 May poll, and the review would look at the policies developed over the past six years. \u201cBetween 2013 and 2019 we almost treated it like one term.

The review by Weatherill and Emerson is expected to be delivered to the party\u2019s national executive next month, with parts of it to be made public. Albanese will then release a series of \u201cvision statements\u201d that will underpin the policies he will take to the next election.",

I am a fit, single 85-year-old with a penchant for international travel. Fifteen years ago I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis and very satisfactorily treated with the antibiotic trimethoprim.</p> <p>My GP retired and another GP set about reviewing this drug, saying that it could no longer be effective. I suffered infections, confirmed by dipstick tests and lab reports, at times being seriously mentally affected, and had difficulty getting appointments to facilitate the planned three-monthly drug rotation, a particular worry for my travel plans. I could so easily have also ended up in hospital.</p> <p>Miracle of miracles, this week the trimethoprim has been reinstated. What a relief.<br><strong>Audrey Gray</strong><br><em>Pulborough, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Proven urinary tract infections (UTIs) must be treated with the relevant antibiotic as reported by the lab microscopy, or the infection will rise to the kidneys. This can be life-threatening. The rise in numbers of UTIs is due to poor hygiene in the increasing numbers of older people, often chair-bound and with very limited mobility, preventing efficient washing to limit bacterial travel.</p> <p>In younger women where today\u2019s sexual climate is much less inhibited, little effort is made to prevent bacterial travel before intercourse. My books and 40 years of teaching show how the presence of simple daily prevention can stop a lifetime of suffering.</p> <p>But prevention is neither taught at home, in school hygiene classes, in nurses\u2019 training courses nor in medical schools.<br>The Qur\u2019an is helpful to men and women in the regular practising of hygiene, but the Bible isn\u2019t. Neither Muslims nor Hindus experience the same levels of infection as western women do. The million-dollar question \u201cwhy do some women get this infection often and some do not?\u201d is down to the different lengths of perianal female geography.<br><strong>Angela Kilmartin</strong><br><em>Author, The Patient\u2019s Encyclopaedia of Urinary Tract Infection, Sexual Cystitis and Interstitial Cystitis</em></p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>How frustrating to read this article, with contributions from medics who have failed to highlight the need for accurate midstream urine collection. Every guideline in the world specifies midstream as the most reliable sample for accurate analysis, diagnosis and treatment of UTI. Yet the matter is persistently overlooked because changing this means changing hearts, minds, attitudes and the relevant patient pathway. What a faff for established systems. My company has data from an FOI request to all NHS trusts in 2016; this revealed national urine contamination rates that varied from below 1% to over 70%, with an average 23.5%; that\u2019s over 16m patients a year who will not be properly diagnosed and treated from their urine sample.

      "bodyText": "I read your article (Antibiotic crackdown linked to big rise in women ending up in hospital with cystitis, 5 October) with great interest. I am a fit, single 85-year-old with a penchant for international travel. Fifteen years ago I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis and very satisfactorily treated with the antibiotic trimethoprim. My GP retired and another GP set about reviewing this drug, saying that it could no longer be effective. I suffered infections, confirmed by dipstick tests and lab reports, at times being seriously mentally affected, and had difficulty getting appointments to facilitate the planned three-monthly drug rotation, a particular worry for my travel plans. I could so easily have also ended up in hospital. Miracle of miracles, this week the trimethoprim has been reinstated. What a relief. Audrey Gray Pulborough, West Sussex \u2022 Proven urinary tract infections (UTIs) must be treated with the relevant antibiotic as reported by the lab microscopy, or the infection will rise to the kidneys. This can be life-threatening. The rise in numbers of UTIs is due to poor hygiene in the increasing numbers of older people, often chair-bound and with very limited mobility, preventing efficient washing to limit bacterial travel. In younger women where today\u2019s sexual climate is much less inhibited, little effort is made to prevent bacterial travel before intercourse. My books and 40 years of teaching show how the presence of simple daily prevention can stop a lifetime of suffering. But prevention is neither taught at home, in school hygiene classes, in nurses\u2019 training courses nor in medical schools. The Qur\u2019an is helpful to men and women in the regular practising of hygiene, but the Bible isn\u2019t. Neither Muslims nor Hindus experience the same levels of infection as western women do. The million-dollar question \u201cwhy do some women get this infection often and some do not?\u201d is down to the different lengths of perianal female geography. Angela Kilmartin Author, The Patient\u2019s Encyclopaedia of Urinary Tract Infection, Sexual Cystitis and Interstitial Cystitis \u2022 How frustrating to read this article, with contributions from medics who have failed to highlight the need for accurate midstream urine collection. Every guideline in the world specifies midstream as the most reliable sample for accurate analysis, diagnosis and treatment of UTI. Yet the matter is persistently overlooked because changing this means changing hearts, minds, attitudes and the relevant patient pathway. What a faff for established systems. My company has data from an FOI request to all NHS trusts in 2016; this revealed national urine contamination rates that varied from below 1% to over 70%, with an average 23.5%; that\u2019s over 16m patients a year who will not be properly diagnosed and treated from their urine sample. If this lack of accuracy was endemic in blood analysis there would rightly be a national outcry. Urine, as a waste product, is not given the same respect, despite being a window to our health. Thanks to a now retired NHS GP, there is a way to get this right: in 2001 Dr Vincent Forte invented an NHS award-winning midstream urine device that now costs the NHS less than 90p; growing evidence confirms that his invention reduces contamination to 1.5% and false positives by up to 70%. These benefits lead to reduced unnecessary prescribing because patients can be treated with targeted antibiotics for the appropriate duration, not the broad spectrum variety believed to encourage antimicrobial resistance (AMR). What does this mean? It means properly treated conditions, healthy patients and huge savings on retests, repeat appointments and more for the NHS itself. Women must not feel that reduced prescribing due to AMR is preventing their treatment, but understand that until the medical profession gets the basics right, treatment itself will remain unreliable. Fifteen years after Dr Forte invented the British-made Peezy Midstream, after much development, trials and investment it is now being used in some NHS antenatal clinics. But much like the variation in contamination data mentioned above, until it is adopted for all urine collection, successful urine screening will remain a national lottery. Meanwhile, the only beneficiaries of failed UTI treatment are the pharmaceutical industry and the labs that are compensated (by the NHS) per sample; right-first-time, prompt, targeted treatment is of no interest to either party. Unfortunately their voices are louder than those of patients in pain.

One is to force the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprise about 60,000 fighters, away from Turkey\u2019s southern border.

      "body": "<p>Giya Kancheli, who has died aged 84 of complications from a heart condition, became Georgia\u2019s leading composer and one of the most distinguished in the Soviet Union in the late 20th century. His fellow Soviet colleague Rodion Shchedrin assessed him as \u201can ascetic with the temperament of a maximalist \u2013 a restrained Vesuvius\u201d. Much of Kancheli\u2019s music combines stillness and beauty with latent violence that occasionally erupts to devastating expressive effect.</p> <p>Audiences in the west came to his music largely through recordings, especially from the Munich based CD label ECM New Series, which began in 1992 with the issue of his grippingly elegiac <a href=\"https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/kancheli-mourned-by-the-wind-light-sorrow\" title=\"\">Vom Winde Beweint</a> (Mourned by the Wind, 1989), a liturgy for viola and orchestra, performed by Kim Kashkashian and conducted by Dennis Russell Davies. Both became longstanding advocates of Kancheli\u2019s music; others for whom he wrote works included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/apr/28/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Mstislav Rostropovich</a>, the violinist <a href=\"https://www.gidonkremer.net/\" title=\"\">Gidon Kremer</a>, the violist <a href=\"http://www.bashmet-festival.com/eng/festival_info/bashmet\" title=\"\">Yuri Bashmet</a>, the conductor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/20/kurt-masur\" title=\"\">Kurt Masur</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kronos-quartet\" title=\"\">Kronos Quartet</a>.</p> <p>Kancheli was a relatively late starter. He was born in Tbilisi, the son of Alexander and Agnessa, and had originally intended to study geology at university after leaving school. But, inspired by hearing Stravinsky\u2019s The Rite of Spring, he went on to study piano and, with Iona Tuskiya, composition at the Tbilisi conservatoire for four years from 1959, at the age of 24.</p> <p>He joined the staff of the conservatoire in 1970 (the same year as he composed his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTaOOcxqX6I\" title=\"\">Symphony No 2 \u201cSongs\u201d</a>) and began a 20-year stint as director of the Rustaveli theatre in Tbilisi the following year. This fostered a long-lasting interest in music for the stage, and also cinema: he composed more than 40 film scores, starting in 1964, the best known of which were for the comedy Mimino (1977) and Kin-dza-dza! (1986), a parodistic, dystopian science fiction film directed by Georgiy Daneliya. His final film score was in 2013 for Daneliya\u2019s lighter, animated remake Ku! Kin-dza-dza.</p> <p>Kancheli\u2019s earliest acknowledged compositions date from his student period, including a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI6N_yFrSI0\" title=\"\">wind quintet </a>and a concerto for orchestra both written in 1961. The latter drew criticism because of the composer\u2019s keen interest in jazz, then regarded still as a dangerous and degenerate western art form by the Soviet cultural authorities. Nonetheless, Kancheli would later be honoured as a People\u2019s Artist of the USSR.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJQ750WlHkc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wJQ750WlHkc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Kancheli\u2019s Styx, for viola, chorus and orchestra, 1999</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He composed seven symphonies between 1967 and 1986, the last bearing the valedictory title \u201cEpilogue\u201d. These works constitute milestones through his earlier career as a composer, moving from the influence of Stravinsky (not least the Symphony of Psalms) to a freer expression, which began to take on more socially aware subjects. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GNTb8qq60\" title=\"\">Symphony No 4, In Memoria di Michelangelo</a> (1974), won a Soviet state prize in 1976, and two years later was premiered in the US by <a href=\"https://imgartists.com/roster/yuri-temirkanov/\" title=\"\">Yuri Temirkanov</a>, shortly before cultural sanctions put his music, and that of many of his compatriots, out of circulation for a time.</p> <p>Its theme of youthful idealism and ardour subverted by adult cynicism was taken further in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9TjZV7DEkY\" title=\"\">Symphony No 5</a> (1977), dedicated to the memory of his parents, while No 6 (1980) is an \u201coutcry against the repression of the human spirit by tyranny\u201d. Its spare textures are unconventional, at times beguiling, at others bleak, the whole representing the peak of his symphonic output and a success that No 7 (1986) failed to replicate.</p> <p>The thaw that came in the wake of glasnost and perestroika brought his music increasingly before an international audience, magnified by Kancheli\u2019s emigration from civil-war torn Georgia to western Europe by 1992, where he lived in Germany and Belgium. High-profile commissions and premieres followed in Europe and North America throughout the next two decades, though his sense of exile and guilt was recorded in the confessional viola concerto <a href=\"https://ecmreviews.com/2010/09/30/abii-ne-viderem/\" title=\"\">Abii Ne Viderem</a> (I turned away so as not to see, 1992-94).</p> <p>The move away from larger forms such as the full-orchestral symphony towards simpler, less complex forms and instrumental textures was acknowledged in a 1997 interview with the critic and broadcaster Rob Cowan: \u201cWhen you are 60, you are less attracted to the huge, mounting layers of sonority that you favoured in your 40s; you become interested in a different scale of sound.\u201d This ties in with another remark of his: \u201cWhen I compose music, I don\u2019t focus on the everyday collisions of life. I want to see it as a bird in flight, from a height, from an angle.\u201d</p> <p>This may explain why Kancheli\u2019s music adopted freer forms with representational titles, eschewing abstract terms such as symphony, concerto, string quartet. Although he only composed one opera, the two-act Music for the Living (1982-84), Kancheli liked to combine voices and solo instruments, as in the series of concerto-like works of the 1990s, Diplipito (cello, countertenor and orchestra, 1997), And Farewell Goes Out Sighing (violin, countertenor and orchestra, 1997) and Styx (viola, chorus and orchestra, 1999).</p> <p>Between 1990 and 1995 he wrote a major sequence of devotional works in different forms with \u2013 mostly \u2013 chamber orchestral accompaniment, collectively entitled Life Without Christmas, starting with Morning Prayers (with taped boy\u2019s voice, 1990), the cantatas Midday Prayers (with soprano and clarinet, 1990) and Evening Prayers (featuring eight alto singers, 1991) and the string quartet Night Prayers (1992-95). In 2010 ECM released the album <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/arts/music/20song.html\" title=\"\">Themes from the Songbook</a>, featuring 20 arrangements of Kancheli\u2019s incidental music for film and theatre.</p> <p>His production slowed down in later years; his final works included another string quartet, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/giya-kancheli-chiaroscuro-album-review-a6724081.html\" title=\"\">Chiaroscuro</a> (2011), another wind quintet (2013) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEiZs_Q-EsI\" title=\"\">Nu.Mu.Zu</a> (I don\u2019t know, 2015), premiered by the National Orchestra of Belgium.</p> <p>Kancheli is survived by his wife, Liulia, and their son and daughter.</p> <p>\u2022 Giya Alexandrovich Kancheli, composer, born 10 August 1935; died 2 October 2019</p>",

These works constitute milestones through his earlier career as a composer, moving from the influence of Stravinsky (not least the Symphony of Psalms) to a freer expression, which began to take on more socially aware subjects. Symphony No 4, In Memoria di Michelangelo (1974), won a Soviet state prize in 1976, and two years later was premiered in the US by Yuri Temirkanov, shortly before cultural sanctions put his music, and that of many of his compatriots, out of circulation for a time. Its theme of youthful idealism and ardour subverted by adult cynicism was taken further in Symphony No 5 (1977), dedicated to the memory of his parents, while No 6 (1980) is an \u201coutcry against the repression of the human spirit by tyranny\u201d. Its spare textures are unconventional, at times beguiling, at others bleak, the whole representing the peak of his symphonic output and a success that No 7 (1986) failed to replicate. The thaw that came in the wake of glasnost and perestroika brought his music increasingly before an international audience, magnified by Kancheli\u2019s emigration from civil-war torn Georgia to western Europe by 1992, where he lived in Germany and Belgium. High-profile commissions and premieres followed in Europe and North America throughout the next two decades, though his sense of exile and guilt was recorded in the confessional viola concerto Abii Ne Viderem (I turned away so as not to see, 1992-94). The move away from larger forms such as the full-orchestral symphony towards simpler, less complex forms and instrumental textures was acknowledged in a 1997 interview with the critic and broadcaster Rob Cowan: \u201cWhen you are 60, you are less attracted to the huge, mounting layers of sonority that you favoured in your 40s; you become interested in a different scale of sound.\u201d This ties in with another remark of his: \u201cWhen I compose music, I don\u2019t focus on the everyday collisions of life. I want to see it as a bird in flight, from a height, from an angle.\u201d This may explain why Kancheli\u2019s music adopted freer forms with representational titles, eschewing abstract terms such as symphony, concerto, string quartet. Although he only composed one opera, the two-act Music for the Living (1982-84), Kancheli liked to combine voices and solo instruments, as in the series of concerto-like works of the 1990s, Diplipito (cello, countertenor and orchestra, 1997), And Farewell Goes Out Sighing (violin, countertenor and orchestra, 1997) and Styx (viola, chorus and orchestra, 1999). Between 1990 and 1995 he wrote a major sequence of devotional works in different forms with \u2013 mostly \u2013 chamber orchestral accompaniment, collectively entitled Life Without Christmas, starting with Morning Prayers (with taped boy\u2019s voice, 1990), the cantatas Midday Prayers (with soprano and clarinet, 1990) and Evening Prayers (featuring eight alto singers, 1991) and the string quartet Night Prayers (1992-95). In 2010 ECM released the album Themes from the Songbook, featuring 20 arrangements of Kancheli\u2019s incidental music for film and theatre. His production slowed down in later years; his final works included another string quartet, Chiaroscuro (2011), another wind quintet (2013) and Nu.Mu.Zu (I don\u2019t know, 2015), premiered by the National Orchestra of Belgium. Kancheli is survived by his wife, Liulia, and their son and daughter. \u2022 Giya Alexandrovich Kancheli, composer, born 10 August 1935; died 2 October 2019",

      "bodyText": "The European Union\u2019s full devastating point-by-point rejection of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposals for the Irish border has been revealed in documents obtained by the Guardian. Leaked papers lay bare the scale of the multiple faults highlighted to David Frost, the prime minister\u2019s chief negotiator, during the most recent talks. The disclosure follows the prime minister\u2019s claim on Monday that he had not yet heard the EU\u2019s thoughts on the legal text tabled by Downing Street, under which a customs border would be reimposed on the island of Ireland. Under the draft text, which the UK has not published in full, Northern Ireland would stay in the EU\u2019s single market for goods and electricity if Stormont consents, giving the DUP a veto before the arrangement comes into force and then every four years. The confidential report chronicling the latest negotiations reveals: The British have been warned that the proposed Stormont veto provides the DUP with an opportunity to block the all-Ireland regulatory zone from ever materialising. The proposals for a customs border were said to risk a major disruption of the all-Ireland economy. EU negotiators have pointed out that it has been rejected by groups representing Northern Irish business. The UK is seeking a fallback of no controls, checks and border infrastructure, even if the DUP vetoes Northern Ireland\u2019s alignment with the single market. The bloc\u2019s internal market would be left wide open for abuse, the European commission has said in its rejection of the proposal. The UK\u2019s proposal leaves it up to a joint EU-UK committee to work out how to avoid customs checks and infrastructure near the Irish border once there are two customs territories and sets of rules on the island of Ireland, without offering a plan B if no such solution is agreed. The UK has called for an overhaul of the common transit convention so as to avoid the need for new infrastructure in the shape of transit offices on either side of the border for the scanning of goods that have passed through multiple territories. Brussels has refused as it would lead other non-EU countries to seek similar exemptions, endangering the internal market. The text affords what is seen as an unacceptable wholesale exemption for small and medium-sized businesses from customs duties and processes, but it fails to provide details on how to then combat smuggling. On VAT, the British negotiators were told that the proposals fail to offer any solutions as to how to avoid payments and checks at the border. Under the UK\u2019s proposals all the state aid and level-playing-field conditions Theresa May agreed to in order to reassure the EU that Northern Ireland businesses would not enjoy a competitive advantage have been deleted. But Northern Irish firms would still be able to compete in the single market for electricity. The UK would have access to an unlisted number of EU databases to allow it to police the customs border on the island of Ireland and the regulatory border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Whitehall would maintain such access even if the DUP vetoed alignment with the single market. The EU\u2019s hard-hitting rebuff was delivered to Frost on Friday and Monday, according to the leaked report, which was compiled after a briefing of EU diplomats by the commission. The message had been passed on to Johnson in a series of phone calls with EU leaders over the weekend, during which Downing Street was left clear that the legal text did not form the basis for serious negotiation. Following Monday\u2019s discussions between Frost and the commission\u2019s negotiating team, a UK government spokesman said it had offered the clarity that had been sought on the proposals. Frost is understood to be staying in Brussels on Monday night but the EU has not yet agreed to negotiate on the detail, given what sources described as the \u201cfundamental flaws\u201d. The British government spokesman said: \u201cFollowing hours of discussions last week, the UK provided additional legal text today. This provided further technical detail on customs and goods regulations to further clarify how the UK\u2019s proposals would operate.\u201d Senior EU sources do not think Frost has any room for manoeuvre to change Johnson\u2019s proposals. The European commission briefed member state diplomats that the UK had outlined \u201cno new concepts\u201d in a slightly revised legal text Frost offered on Monday. EU sources scoffed at claims coming out of Downing Street that a \u201ccounter-offer\u201d could be expected from Brussels in the coming days. \u201cIt is the UK that wants to replace the backstop \u2013 and that is our solution,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat. On Monday, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, met with the Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, who tweeted: \u201cFrank &amp; honest discussion today with Steve Barclay. As good neighbours do. \u201cImportant questions still remain on UK Brexit proposals and more realism and clarity necessary this week. Full support for Michel Barnier.\u201d An EU commission spokeswoman said the EU27 remained of the opinion that the UK had failed to offer an alternative to the Irish backstop, which would avoid a hard border by keeping Northern Ireland in the single market and the EU\u2019s customs territory. She said: \u201cWe all agree that we need a workable solution now and not something based on untried and revokable arrangements that would be left to negotiation during the transition period. \u201cThe UK\u2019s proposals do not meet at present the objectives of the protocol on Northern Ireland/Ireland and this is the shared view of the EU parliament but also all member states.\u201d The British government\u2019s refusal to share the detailed legal text beyond the small circle of EU negotiators has infuriated diplomats and sowed confusion about the UK\u2019s intentions on key points, such as the transition extension. Under the current agreement the UK could extend the transition until the end of 2022, if both sides agree, but the UK is seeking to drop a reference in the Irish protocol to such an extension. Some EU diplomats suspect the change is presentational, to match the government\u2019s insistence it can get a speedy agreement on a future trade deal. The Guardian understands that the UK does not intend to drop the transition extension from the withdrawal agreement.",

Chris Skidmore is to meet representatives from private developers providing student accommodation as well as universities after it emerged that freshers have had to be rehoused \u2013 some up to 30 miles away \u2013 because their promised accommodation was not ready. The minister said the situation was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d, particularly because of the potential impact on student welfare, and warned that accommodation providers who fall short on their commitments would be held accountable.

What part, after all, could this 24-year-old female furniture designer possibly play in Le Corbusier\u2019s high-minded plan to revolutionise the modern world?</p> <p>Yet one month later, at the annual Salon d\u2019Automne, the grandmaster found himself at Perriand\u2019s Bar Sous le Toit, or Bar Under the Roof, which re-created a section of her own apartment. Le Corbusier was spellbound; this was the intoxicating hymn to the machine age he had been dreaming of. Nickel-plated copper stools were clustered around an anodised aluminium cocktail bar, while a chrome-plated table nestled beside a leather banquette and a built-in gramophone cabinet.</p> <p>Such riches \u2013 yet all cleverly designed to fit into Perriand\u2019s small attic. It caused a sensation. As Perriand later recalled: \u201cThe upright Salon hadn\u2019t expected its galleries to bubble with such brazen youth.\u201d Corbusier hired her on the spot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9ab4489d03ba0b296b645bbe3334fb6aaa0d5cbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ab4489d03ba0b296b645bbe3334fb6aaa0d5cbe/0_269_4527_3263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A model poses with a hinoki wood table and wool rug, circa 1955, by Charlotte Perriand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"721\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japanophile \u2026 a model poses with a wool rug and hinoki cypress wood coffee table made by Perriand in the 50s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 ADAGP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Twenty years after her death, Perriand\u2019s brazen, maverick, youthful spirit is once again thrilling Paris, as an <a href=\"https://www.fondationlouisvuitton.fr/en/exhibitions/exhibition/charlotte-perriand.html\">epic </a><a href=\"https://www.fondationlouisvuitton.fr/en/exhibitions/exhibition/charlotte-perriand.html\">exhibition of her life and work opens at the Fondation Louis Vuitton</a>.

However, the new creation was credited to the studio of Le Corbusier. It was produced to spearhead the arrival of his \u201cEquipment for Living\u201d, which was intended to replace all traditional home furnishings from then on.

I was familiar with current technology, I knew how to use it and, what is more, I had ideas about the uses it could be put to.\u201d The new exhibition shines a welcome spotlight on the woman who devised the furniture and much more, bringing her out from behind the plumped pillows to show her as a pioneering creator of the modern world in her own right.</p> <p>An athletic figure with a close-cropped bob and a penchant for doing calisthenics outdoors, Perriand embodied<em> l\u2019esprit nouveau</em>.

It is a taste of the mischievous spirit that runs through all four floors of the exhibition, charting her seven decades at the forefront of furniture, photography and architecture \u2013 from her 1920s interiors to her vast ski resort masterplans, as well as a tea house she built for Unesco in 1993 at the age of 90.</p> <p>Enjoying the ample budget the LVMH coffers provided, the show features a number of precisely reconstructed interiors, inviting visitors to loll on loungers and swivel in replica chairs, immersing themselves in Perriand\u2019s materially rich universe.

Twenty years after her death, Perriand\u2019s brazen, maverick, youthful spirit is once again thrilling Paris, as an epic exhibition of her life and work opens at the Fondation Louis Vuitton.

We think of 1920s modernism as a sober, static black-and-white affair, depicted in grainy archive photographs. But this shows Perriand\u2019s world to be as bright as a rainbow and alive with ideas. In one room, a glossy-brown PVC curtain hangs in a cool, blue-tiled bathroom, its slinky folds dangling next to a futuristic aluminium shower capsule that looks as if it could transport bathers to another dimension. Across a chrome-trimmed cabinet is the living area, where a rippling-green glass dining table is surrounded by chairs in mustard yellow and cobalt-blue leather.

In his judgment <strong>Lord Pentland </strong>effectively said he would take the government at its word and that, if Johnson broke his promise to the court, that would be \u201cdestructive\u201d to the constitution. Pentland said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If I may put the point another way, the government accepts that in executing its political policy it must comply with the 2019 Act. That being the government\u2019s clearly stated position before the court, there is no need for coercive orders against it or against the prime minister to be pronounced. The court should not pronounce coercive orders (or decree for interdict) unless it has been established on the basis of cogent evidence that it is truly necessary for such orders to be granted. In my opinion, that has not been done in the present case.</p> \n   <p>I would add only this. I approach matters on the basis that it would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>James Duddridge, a Brexit minister, has dismissed as \u201crubbish\u201d and \u201cnot true\u201d a claim that the government plans to lower employment and environmental standards after Brexit.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/07/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-court-to-decide-if-boris-johnson-can-be-forced-to-sign-extension-letter-live-news?page=with:block-5d9b542a8f08fbb0c17228e3#block-5d9b542a8f08fbb0c17228e3\">4.12pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/07/jennifer-arcuri-refuses-to-rule-out-claims-of-affair-with-boris-johnson\">Jennifer Arcuri, the American businesswoman at the centre of a conflict of interest row involving the prime minister confirmed she had a \u201cvery close bond\u201d with Boris Johnson and refused to rule out claims they had an affair.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/far-right-swooping-on-towns-to-exploit-tensions-report-says\">Far-right activists are exploiting community tensions by swooping into towns and cities and distorting the truth in an effort to turn residents against minorities, particularly Muslims, the government\u2019s chief adviser on extremism has found.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/07/mp-stephen-hepburn-suspended-over-sexual-harassment-allegation\">The Labour MP Stephen Hepburn has been suspended from the party while officials investigate a complaint that he sexually harassed a female party member.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/07/families-lose-high-court-challenge-over-special-needs-funding\">Families who launched a landmark legal challenge to the government\u2019s funding </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/07/families-lose-high-court-challenge-over-special-needs-funding\">of services for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) have lost their high court case.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> \n  <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9b61758f081108db9c3e4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-07T16:04:46.023Z\">5.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cUlster says No,\u201d is one of the historic cries of unionism.

It\u2019s an issue that affects everyone in society in one way or another.</p> \n   <p>Particularly in south America, where cocaine originates from, you have murder and disappearances on a mass scale, massive environmental destruction and visible corruption of government. Rather than having short term solution to problems we face, the Greens are taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture.</p> \n   <p>All of this death, harm and destruction stems from the fact that drug use is illegal and unregulated. The only way to regulate drug use is to create a legal system.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Under the proposals, closely regulated specialist pharmacies would be permitted to sell recreational drugs to adults at fixed doses and prices over the counter after a safety consultation. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cPeople would know exactly what they were taking,\u201d Armitage said. \u201cIt solves the problem of drug dealers cutting drugs with unknown substances.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p><em>UPDATE: </em>We have amended the copy above to remove a reference to two class A drugs.

Rahman says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The election could turn on this question: how damaging will an extension be for Boris? His strategy is to make enough gains in Labour-held leave areas in the North and Midlands to offset likely losses to the SNP in Scotland and the pro-Remain Lib Dems in the South. This gamble would be compounded by an extension, which would likely play into the hands of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, who would cry betrayal. To win a majority, the Tories need to further squeeze the Brexit party\u2019s vote.</p> \n   <p>Initially, Boris allies were nervous about the impact of an extension. But during last week\u2019s Tory conference they became confident that the \u201cFarage factor\u201d would not scupper Johnson\u2019s chances of victory. They were cheered by opinion poll and focus group findings that the PM would not be blamed for the latest delay to Brexit. As one aide said: \u201cThe public see him as Mr. Brexit and the only one who can deliver it. They know who is responsible [for delay] and we will keep reminding them of it.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Team Boris is confident of success in what is a \u201cblame game\u201d at three levels\u2014pinning responsibility for the coming extension on the EU, Parliament and the judiciary. It could be called the ABB strategy\u2014anyone but Boris.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But in <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/delivery-rather-than-detail-gives-johnson-the-brexit-edge-over-may-htc8lm9f2\">an article in the Times (paywall)</a> the leading psephologist <strong>Prof Sir John Curtice</strong> is not convinced that Johnson will be able to escape the blame so easily.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So far, confidence in Mr Johnson\u2019s handling of Brexit \u2014 and indeed his party\u2019s standing in the polls which, according to Opinium\u2019s latest poll, is, at 38 per cent, higher than at any time since last February, before Mrs May failed to deliver Brexit \u2014 has not suffered in the wake of what are already diminishing expectations among voters that Brexit will be delivered at the end of the month.</p> \n   <p>According to YouGov, at the beginning of September, three in five (60 per cent) Leave voters thought it likely that Brexit would have happened by October 31, while only about one in four (27 per cent) thought it unlikely. Now only about a half of them (49 per cent) expect Mr Johnson to meet the deadline.</p> \n   <p>Still, that potentially leaves a lot of voters whose hopes and expectations will be dashed if Brexit is not delivered at the end of the month. Of course, they may decide that some combination of the EU, the judges, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson are responsible for any failure to deliver Brexit. But expect Nigel Farage to point the finger of blame at Mr Johnson and his Conservative Party.

If Johnson won back half of the Brexit party vote then he might win a comfortable majority, with 348 seats to Labour\u2019s 201. If he goes further and wins back three-quarters of Farage\u2019s Brexiteers then the number of Conservative seats increased at around 370 to Labour\u2019s 185 - a commanding majority.</p> \n   <p>Might this actually happen? We do think that the Brexit party vote is softer than some think, for a couple of reasons. First, when these voters are asked who would make the best prime minister - Johnson or Corbyn- <a href=\"https://matthewjgoodwin.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=622abafa668ae542eeba8dd1f&amp;id=d23ab49459&amp;e=bec083766b\">they break 84% to 1%</a> for Johnson. Lord Ashcroft asked a slightly different question, whether they would want to see a Conservative government led by Johnson or a Labour government led by Corbyn. <a href=\"https://matthewjgoodwin.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=622abafa668ae542eeba8dd1f&amp;id=91c7bbe7ca&amp;e=bec083766b\">94% opted for a Johnson government</a>. A campaign that inevitably presents voters with this simple binary choice would likely see many Brexit party voters conclude \u201cJohnson\u201d.</p> \n   <p>Even this week, as the pressure on Johnson became clear, large majorities of Brexit party voters still felt that <a href=\"https://matthewjgoodwin.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=622abafa668ae542eeba8dd1f&amp;id=6af18f56ff&amp;e=bec083766b\">he is competent, decisive, strong, likeable, authentic and \u2018in touch with ordinary people\u2019</a>. In fact, 91% of Brexit party voters openly reject the idea that Johnson should resign and want him to remain as prime minister. Put simply, these do not look like people who are about to revolt <em>en masse</em>. It was also telling that when Nigel Farage called on Johnson to resign he was widely criticised by his own voters on social media. Furthermore, so long as Johnson appears sincere in his support for a \u2018meaningful\u2019, \u2018clean\u2019 or \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit then these Brexit party voters are instinctively on side. As <a href=\"https://matthewjgoodwin.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=622abafa668ae542eeba8dd1f&amp;id=12f22e5e24&amp;e=bec083766b\">polling made clear</a> this week, 81% want Britain to leave with no deal while 91% would \u2018not be worried\u2019 if Britain left without a deal. <br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Five years ago Ford and Goodwin co-wrote an acclaimed book on Ukip, Revolt on the Right.

He says he thinks the chances of the UK and the EU agreeing a deal this week are now \u201cclose to zero\u201d, and that the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening on 31 October are also \u201cextremely small\u201d. We\u2019re heading for an election, he assumes.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>UK ministers admit privately there is little prospect of agreement. As one put it: \u201cIf the consent mechanism [on regulation] were the only problem, then a deal would be doable. But if we say Northern Ireland must be in the UK customs territory and the EU says it must be in the [EU] customs union, the problems are insurmountable. That\u2019s where we are.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Downing Street\u2019s official line remains that the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal. At the same time, it insists the government \u201cwill obey\u201d the Benn Act approved by parliament, forcing Johnson to seek an extension to UK membership if a deal has not been approved by parliament by 19 October. Ministers refuse to say how these contradictory positions will be reconciled. Some admit privately they do not know.</p> \n   <p>We think Johnson will pursue a strategy some aides describe as \u201cbeing dragged, kicking and screaming\u201d into an extension, so Leave voters know he is doing it against his will. This is why he still promises \u201cno delay\u201d even though he knows the prospects of a deal are remote.</p> \n   <p>He may play for time on 19 October, so the Benn Act is tested in the courts (Johnson would swiftly be taken to court if he did not comply immediately). The courts could send a letter on the government\u2019s behalf, or order a civil servant or another minister to do so. Outright refusal to obey the law is a non-starter; it could provoke several resignations including those of Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, and Robert Buckland, the justice secretary.</p> \n   <p>So we think that, sooner or later, Johnson will send the letter required by the act, but that too could be tested in the courts. It will likely describe the proposed delay as \u201cparliament\u2019s extension\u201d, not one sought by the government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9af96a8f081108db9c399e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-07T08:38:17.877Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from my colleague <strong>Severin Carrell.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1181125933643771904\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Seems <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaleVince?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DaleVince</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JolyonMaugham</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joannaccherry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@joannaccherry</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BennAct?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BennAct</a> decision won\u2019t be published until noon, in writing.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street has sought to deflect the blame for the Brexit impasse on to Britain\u2019s EU counterparts, as Boris Johnson\u2019s plans continue to meet a frosty reception. Johnson himself has claimed that the EU has not yet explained in detail what its objections to his plan are. (See 12.32pm.) Anti-Brexit campaigners have failed in a legal bid to get a Scottish court to issue an order saying Johnson must seek a Brexit extension if he does not agree a deal with the EU, as the Benn Act requires. But they claimed that that case served a valuable function because, in evidence to the court, the government committed itself to complying with this legislation. In his judgment Lord Pentland effectively said he would take the government at its word and that, if Johnson broke his promise to the court, that would be \u201cdestructive\u201d to the constitution. Pentland said: If I may put the point another way, the government accepts that in executing its political policy it must comply with the 2019 Act. That being the government\u2019s clearly stated position before the court, there is no need for coercive orders against it or against the prime minister to be pronounced. The court should not pronounce coercive orders (or decree for interdict) unless it has been established on the basis of cogent evidence that it is truly necessary for such orders to be granted. In my opinion, that has not been done in the present case. I would add only this. I approach matters on the basis that it would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do. James Duddridge, a Brexit minister, has dismissed as \u201crubbish\u201d and \u201cnot true\u201d a claim that the government plans to lower employment and environmental standards after Brexit. (See 4.12pm.) Jennifer Arcuri, the American businesswoman at the centre of a conflict of interest row involving the prime minister confirmed she had a \u201cvery close bond\u201d with Boris Johnson and refused to rule out claims they had an affair. Far-right activists are exploiting community tensions by swooping into towns and cities and distorting the truth in an effort to turn residents against minorities, particularly Muslims, the government\u2019s chief adviser on extremism has found. The Labour MP Stephen Hepburn has been suspended from the party while officials investigate a complaint that he sexually harassed a female party member. Families who launched a landmark legal challenge to the government\u2019s funding of services for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) have lost their high court case. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. \u201cUlster says No,\u201d is one of the historic cries of unionism. The DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson has inverted that in a statement - one of several we\u2019ve had from the party recently - strongly criticising the Irish government for its stance on Brexit. Wilson said: It seems the \u2018not an inch\u2019 approach in Dublin will lead to no deal. How times have changed. Its now a case of \u2018Dublin Says No\u2019. The DUP has worked with the prime minister to place a reasonable proposal on the table. It may not be perfect but it\u2019s a fair deal. It recognises our unique situation and respects the referendum result ... In every negotiation there must be give and take. The Irish prime minister must realise that we will not support Northern Ireland being held to ransom by either Dublin or Brussels. In response to another urgent question Conor Burns, an international trade minister, has told MPs that the government will publish its plans for the tariffs that would apply in the event of a no-deal Brexit \u201cshortly\u201d. That may mean tomorrow. Theresa May\u2019s government published its own tariff schedule for no deal, but the new government will take a different approach. In the Commons James Duddridge, the Brexit minister, has just said that his boss, the Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, is going around Europe \u201cwhipping up support and enthusiasm\u201d for the PM\u2019s Brexit deal. (If Barclay is supposed to be whipping up enthusiasm for the deal, there is precious little evidence so far that his mission is having any success.) These are from Dale Vince, the businessman who took the case to the Scottish court of session calling for a ruling saying Boris Johnson would have to obey the Benn Act, along with Joanna Cherry and Jolyon Maugham. In her question a few minutes ago Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said the government\u2019s refusal to publish the legal text would prompt fears that the government was prepared to lower standards. Surely the public had a right to know if the PM was prepared to sacrifice the quality of food on supermarket shelves, the rights of workers to take holiday and the rights of children to breath clean air? James Duddridge, the Brext minister, replied: Quite frankly, that\u2019s a load of rubbish. That is not our intention. And our constituents, if they are worried and scared as a result of what the Liberal Democrats say, that is a terrible thing. It just simply is not true. The Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi asked if the DUP had seen the full legal text. Why would it be right for them to see it, but not the other opposition parties. Duddridge said he would not comment. He said MPs who had been ministers would know that, in a negotiation, different people see different bits of text. In the Commons Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, said something did not add up in relation to what James Duddridge said about there being no need for new infrastructure in Ireland. He said Boris Johnson told the BBC last week there would be a system of customs checks away from the border. But the plan published last week said customs checks would be carried out at traders\u2019 premises, or other designated locations. And it said goods would be under customs supervision as they crossed the border. So how can you have customs checks with no customs infrastructure? Duddridge replied: The government are looking for a tailored solution. He said the sort of procedures mentioned in the plan were already being used in some places. Duddridge is responding to Starmer. He says what the PM said in the Commons on Thursday last week about there being no need for any new infrastructure anywhere was correct. And he says the government is committed to upholding rights. That will become clear when the text is published, he says. Starmer is responding. He says MPs have not seen the 44-page legal text. That means they have to guess, or, even worse, take the PM\u2019s word for it. He says the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says there is a contradiction between the plan and what Boris Johnson told MPs last week about there being no need for any new infrastructure in Northern Ireland. He says Duddridge should clear this up. Both Varadkar and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, have called for the text to be published, he says. What is the government hiding? He says, if it is true that workers\u2019 and environmental rights will be protected, the full legal text should be published so people can be reassured. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has just asked his urgent question on when the government the legal text of its new Brexit plan James Duddridge, the Brexit minister, is replying. He says the government is \u201cunconditionally committed\u201d to finding a solution to the Irish border issue. It is committed to avoiding \u201cinfrastructure, checks or controls\u201d at the border in Ireland. He says the government published details of its new plan last week. At the same time it also shared a legal text of the proposed changed to the withdrawal agreement with the European commission, but on a confidential basis. He says the government will only publish this at a time when doing so would help it get a deal. The SNP has today announced it is setting up a social justice and fairness commission, which it says will show how Scotland could use independence to create a fairer society. It is intended to complement the work of the SNP\u2019s sustainable growth commission, which reported last year. Shona Robison, the former Scottish government\u2019s health secretary who will convene the commission, said: Independence is fundamentally about creating a better Scotland. The social justice and fairness commission will explore in detail how we can use the powers of independence to end poverty, tackle inequality and improve the lives of families across Scotland. That\u2019s a crucial task \u2013 both for persuading people of the case for independence, and for building a better country once we achieve it. Here is the full list of commission members. Plaid Cymru has confirmed that it would support Jeremy Corbyn as leader of an interim administration to prevent a no-deal Brexit. A Plaid Cymru source said: It\u2019s not about who, but about how we stop a disastrous crash-out Brexit. This is about policies not personalities. The focus now must be on ensuring that the anti-no deal legislation is enacted. We cannot afford to do anything to jeopardise that \u2013 that includes playing party political games over who should lead a caretaker administration. Plaid Cymru has said we will work with anyone who can command a majority if a caretaker administration is needed to block a no-deal, secure an extension and deliver a referendum. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. This is from the SNP MP Joanna Cherry, one of the people who brought the case to the Scottish court of session in an attempt to get a ruling that Boris Johnson must comply with the Benn Act. She said: As a result of this important court action, we have forced the Tory government to concede that the prime minister will comply with the law, and promise to send a letter requesting a Brexit extension and not frustrate the purpose of the Benn Act. However, given Boris Johnson\u2019s slippery track record of acting unlawfully, and the contradictory statements issued by the UK government - we do not trust the Tory leader or believe he can be taken at his word to obey the letter and spirit of the law. As such, we will appeal the decision, and expect that appeal to be heard tomorrow. A senior member of the Home Office\u2019s drugs advisory panel has quit, claiming political interference is undermining its independence. Prof Alex Stevens, who worked on the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), has posted a thread on Twitter explaining his decision, which was revealed by the Guardian. Here is a Guardian video of the Extinction Rebellion protests around Westminster. This is from Neale Richmond, an Irish senator and Fine Gael Europe spokesperson, explaining for the benefit of Boris Johnson (see 12.32pm) what the EU thinks the problems are with the UK\u2019s Brexit plan. Bruno Bonnell, a French MP for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s En Marche! party, told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live this morning that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan was \u201calmost like a joke\u201d. He explained: It\u2019s not a final version - it\u2019s almost like a joke. We don\u2019t even understand it ... This is not a genuine offer. This is clearly a political manipulation to put the responsibility of a no-deal Brexit on the EU\u2019s side. Explaining his objection to the proposal, he said: First of all, what he is suggesting right now is a very complex process, and even more complicated than what is proposed by the backstop. Secondly, it\u2019s again a last-minute proposal, as if he wanted to force the issue and put the responsibility of a no-deal Brexit onto the EU\u2019s shoulders. I mean we don\u2019t want to pick and choose here. He is the one who refused the deal that was in place, that was proposed, that was negotiated. The European commission said it plans to \u201ctake stock\u201d later this week in terms of making an assessment of the UK\u2019s Brexit plan. At its regular, daily briefing, the commission\u2019s chief spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said: Talks will continue today and this week in order to give the UK the opportunity to present their proposals in more detail and then we will take stock with member states and the European parliament throughout the week. And, as we have said before, everyday counts in these talks. I think we have said many times that we are available 24/7. Labour MP Stephen Hepburn has been suspended from the party following a complaint of sexual harassment, the Press Association reports. It is understood his case has been referred to the national constitutional committee and he has been suspended pending that process. Ian Jones from the Press Association has filed this, looking at four potential dates for the general election. Time is running out for a general election to take place before the Christmas season. The earliest date for polling day is probably Thursday November 28. By law, parliament has to be dissolved 25 working days before a general election. For an election on November 28, dissolution would need to take place on October 24. This would give MPs time to debate and vote on the Queen\u2019s Speech, which is taking place on October 14. It also avoids a clash with the EU summit of October 17/18. But MPs may want to wait until after October 31, the day on which the government says the UK will leave the EU, with or without a deal, before triggering an election. Under this scenario, MPs could hold the trigger-vote on November 4 or 5, parliament would be dissolved on November 7, with polling day falling on December 12. A dissolution any later than November 7 would push the election very close to Christmas. A third scenario could see MPs try to fix polling day for as early as possible in the new year, probably on January 9. This would mean dissolution on December 2, however, and it seems unlikely politicians would wish to spend the festive period campaigning. MPs may therefore decide to sit tight and wait until Christmas is out of the way before triggering an election, with dissolution potentially on January 9 followed by polling day on February 13. The Green party has proposed the legalisation of drug use in the UK and the establishment of a regulated market with tightly-controlled specialist pharmacies selling currently illegal substances. It appears to be the first time a UK political party has gone so far as to call for the radical change in drug policy, and it comes amid heightened concern over the exploitation of teenagers by county lines drug gangs and record drug-related deaths. Dr Alex Armitage, the Green party candidate for Hackney North and Stoke Newington who is leading on the policy told the Guardian: Our policy stems from the fact that we\u2019re recognising more and more that the prohibition of drugs is a complete and utter failure, particularly for people marginalised in society. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re dealer recruited into organised crime group after being excluded from school, or a person who was abused as a child who uses heroin to numb the pain or whether you live in an affluent area and worry about your home being burgled by people who need to steal to enable their drug use. It\u2019s an issue that affects everyone in society in one way or another. Particularly in south America, where cocaine originates from, you have murder and disappearances on a mass scale, massive environmental destruction and visible corruption of government. Rather than having short term solution to problems we face, the Greens are taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture. All of this death, harm and destruction stems from the fact that drug use is illegal and unregulated. The only way to regulate drug use is to create a legal system. Under the proposals, closely regulated specialist pharmacies would be permitted to sell recreational drugs to adults at fixed doses and prices over the counter after a safety consultation. \u201cPeople would know exactly what they were taking,\u201d Armitage said. \u201cIt solves the problem of drug dealers cutting drugs with unknown substances.\u201d UPDATE: We have amended the copy above to remove a reference to two class A drugs. The party has now clarified its position and it says its policy to regulate the supply of drugs, including fuller details of the drugs covered, will be released in due course. Here is some Twitter comment on the Scottish court judgment. From the law lecturer and Times journalist Raphael Hogarth From my colleague Severin Carrell From David Anderson, the QC, crossbench peer and former independent reviewer of terror legislation From the FT\u2019s legal commentator David Allen Green Here is a link to the full text of the Scottish court\u2019s judgment. These are from Jolyon Maugham, the lawyer who has lost the case in Scotland intended to get the court to issue an order compelling Boris Johnson to comply with the Benn Act. Here is James Cleverly, the Conservative party chairman\u2019s, take on the Brexit crisis. There are five urgent questions in the Commons today. During his interviews at Watford hospital Boris Johnson also said he was willing to speak to President Trump about the American diplomat\u2019s wife who is using diplomatic immunity to escape criminal proceedings in relation to a car crash that killed Harry Dunn, 19, in Northamptonshire. Johnson said: I think everybody\u2019s sympathies are very much with the family of Harry Dunn and our condolences to them for their tragic loss. I must answer you directly, I do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose. And I hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country. That\u2019s a point that we\u2019ve raised or are raising today with the american ambassador here in the UK and I hope it will be resolved very shortly. And to anticipate a question you might want to raise, if we can\u2019t resolve it then of course I will be raising it myself personally with the White House. Anti-Brexit campaigners have failed in an attempt to force Boris Johnson to ask for an extension to article 50 if he is unable to get a Brexit deal through parliament, my colleague Severin Carrell reports. His story goes on: Lord Pentland, sitting in the court of session in Edinburgh, rejected their request for a court order instructing the prime minister to seek an extension if he cannot get a deal passed by the Commons this month. Here is the full story. Boris Johnson has also restated his claim that the UK will definitely leave the EU on 31 October - even though MPs have passed the Benn Act, which is intended to stop that happening. Asked about the Scottish court case about whether he must send a letter requesting an extension in the event of there being no deal, Johnson said: We will study any judgments, of course, very closely, as we always do. We will respect the law. And we will leave the European Union on October 31. Clearly, that\u2019s what the people of this country voted for. I think most people just want just to get Brexit done. The court of sessions judgement on Brexit will be out at 12.45pm, the lawyer Jolyon Maugham says. This is what Boris Johnson said at Watford hospital when a reporter asked him if his Brexit plan was \u201cdead in the water\u201d. He replied: Our proposal is very fair, very reasonable. What it does is respect the Good Friday agreement, the peace process in Northern Ireland. It makes sure there\u2019s no hard border, no checks at all at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. It also goes further in allowing Northern Ireland and Ireland in alignment, both for agrifoods, for cattle and so on, but also for industrial goods as well. That\u2019s a big step forward, big advance, big compromise by the UK government. What we are saying to our friends is, this is a very generous, fair and reasonable offer that we have made. What we would like to hear from you now is what your thoughts are. And if you have issues with any of the proposals that we\u2019ve come up with, then let\u2019s get into the detail and discuss them. It was then put to Johnson that his Finnish opposite number, Antti Rinne, had said Johnson was only just now realising what a \u201cbig mess\u201d Brexit is and that Emmanuel Macron, the French president, was saying a deal would have to be agreed by Friday. Johnson replied: Well, I spoke to both Antti Rinne, the Finnish prime minster, and to Emmanuel Macron yesterday. And I think they can see that there is an argument now for pushing on and getting on with some substantive talks on the detail of what we are proposing ... The issue is, what is the EU\u2019s objection [to the UK plan]. We haven\u2019t really heard the detail from them about what they think the problems are. It is time for use to get together and really thrash this thing out. Johnson\u2019s claim not to know why the EU is objecting to his plan is surprising. Everyone else seems to know, and Johnson himself has spoken to a series of EU leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, Donald Tusk, the European council president, and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM). There is a good summary of EU objections here, in the statement from the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group. Johnson also refused to answer questions about the Jennifer Arcuri interview on Good Morning Britain this morning (see 9.17am), saying he had already said all he wanted to on this matter. Boris Johnson has been visiting Watford general hospital this morning. Looking at the photographs from the visit, it seems that for the second time in a week he\u2019s been engaging in mug politics - getting your chinaware to do your political messaging. Here is last week\u2019s example. Johnson has also been giving interviews. I will post the highlights shortly. The lawyer Jolyon Maugham has a useful Twitter thread on what to expect from today\u2019s court of session Brexit judgment. It starts here. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing, and nothing was said by the prime minister\u2019s spokesman to suggest that Boris Johnson thinks there is much chance of the UK reaching a Brexit agreement with the EU this week. Johnson is due to hold telephone calls today with the prime ministers of Sweden, Denmark and Poland, but the spokesman did not announce any plans for Johnson to hold face-to-face meetings with his EU counterparts and he would not deny a report saying a meeting with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has not taken place because Merkel\u2019s office could not find a slot for him in the diary. There was a stage when Johnson was claiming that the UK was making significant progress in its talks with the EU. But the spokesman was not using language like that this morning, although when pressed he said that the EU did view the publication of the UK plans last week as a \u201cstep forward\u201d. The spokesman also kept stressing that it was now up to the EU to compromise. Asked about Stef Blok, the Dutch foreign minister, saying this morning that the EU wanted \u201cmore realism and clarity\u201d from the UK on Brexit, the spokesman replied: We are ready to talk with the EU at a pace to secure a deal so that we can move on and build a new partnership between the UK and the EU, but if this is to be possible the EU must match the compromises that the UK has made. Blok made his comment after a meeting with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing. I will post again after 11.30am. On the BBC\u2019s Westminster Hour last night Lee Rowley, a Tory Brexiter who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal three times, said he did not think leave voters would blame Boris Johnson if Brexit were delayed. He explained: I think the British people have more or less clocked what\u2019s going on here. And I was out in my constituency, North East Derbyshire - 60% leave seat, formerly Labour-held for 80 years \u2013 this weekend. I lost track of the number of people who said to me on the doorstep \u2013we know what\u2019s going on, Boris is trying to get a deal and he is also trying to get us out. And if he doesn\u2019t achieve that, and Boris is clear that he is going to do that, but if he doesn\u2019t, we know where the problem will be. Because it\u2019s the same problem that\u2019s been there\u2019s been for the last two years. Parliament doesn\u2019t want to leave. One of the key questions in British politics at the moment is whether pro-leave voters will blame Boris Johnson if Brexit has to be extended, and line up behind Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party at the general election, or whether they will give Johnson the benefit on the grounds that at least he tried. As Mujtaba Rahman says in his Eurasia briefing (see 9.57am), No 10 used to think a Brexit delay would be disastrous for the Tories electorally, but now they have changed their mind. Rahman says: The election could turn on this question: how damaging will an extension be for Boris? His strategy is to make enough gains in Labour-held leave areas in the North and Midlands to offset likely losses to the SNP in Scotland and the pro-Remain Lib Dems in the South. This gamble would be compounded by an extension, which would likely play into the hands of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, who would cry betrayal. To win a majority, the Tories need to further squeeze the Brexit party\u2019s vote. Initially, Boris allies were nervous about the impact of an extension. But during last week\u2019s Tory conference they became confident that the \u201cFarage factor\u201d would not scupper Johnson\u2019s chances of victory. They were cheered by opinion poll and focus group findings that the PM would not be blamed for the latest delay to Brexit. As one aide said: \u201cThe public see him as Mr. Brexit and the only one who can deliver it. They know who is responsible [for delay] and we will keep reminding them of it.\u201d Team Boris is confident of success in what is a \u201cblame game\u201d at three levels\u2014pinning responsibility for the coming extension on the EU, Parliament and the judiciary. It could be called the ABB strategy\u2014anyone but Boris. But in an article in the Times (paywall) the leading psephologist Prof Sir John Curtice is not convinced that Johnson will be able to escape the blame so easily. So far, confidence in Mr Johnson\u2019s handling of Brexit \u2014 and indeed his party\u2019s standing in the polls which, according to Opinium\u2019s latest poll, is, at 38 per cent, higher than at any time since last February, before Mrs May failed to deliver Brexit \u2014 has not suffered in the wake of what are already diminishing expectations among voters that Brexit will be delivered at the end of the month. According to YouGov, at the beginning of September, three in five (60 per cent) Leave voters thought it likely that Brexit would have happened by October 31, while only about one in four (27 per cent) thought it unlikely. Now only about a half of them (49 per cent) expect Mr Johnson to meet the deadline. Still, that potentially leaves a lot of voters whose hopes and expectations will be dashed if Brexit is not delivered at the end of the month. Of course, they may decide that some combination of the EU, the judges, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson are responsible for any failure to deliver Brexit. But expect Nigel Farage to point the finger of blame at Mr Johnson and his Conservative Party. Much could yet depend on who wins and loses the blame game. Rob Ford, a politics professor, thinks leave voters will turn on Johnson if there is an extension. (BXP is the Brexit party.) But Matthew Goodwin, another academic, takes an alternative view. In a briefing he sent out at the end of last week Goodwin explained in more detail why he thinks, in an election, Johnson could win the support of people currently saying they would vote for the Brexit party. Were Johnson and his team to successfully recruit Brexit party voters [at the general election] then they would likely win sizeable majorities. If Johnson won back half of the Brexit party vote then he might win a comfortable majority, with 348 seats to Labour\u2019s 201. If he goes further and wins back three-quarters of Farage\u2019s Brexiteers then the number of Conservative seats increased at around 370 to Labour\u2019s 185 - a commanding majority. Might this actually happen? We do think that the Brexit party vote is softer than some think, for a couple of reasons. First, when these voters are asked who would make the best prime minister - Johnson or Corbyn- they break 84% to 1% for Johnson. Lord Ashcroft asked a slightly different question, whether they would want to see a Conservative government led by Johnson or a Labour government led by Corbyn. 94% opted for a Johnson government. A campaign that inevitably presents voters with this simple binary choice would likely see many Brexit party voters conclude \u201cJohnson\u201d. Even this week, as the pressure on Johnson became clear, large majorities of Brexit party voters still felt that he is competent, decisive, strong, likeable, authentic and \u2018in touch with ordinary people\u2019. In fact, 91% of Brexit party voters openly reject the idea that Johnson should resign and want him to remain as prime minister. Put simply, these do not look like people who are about to revolt en masse. It was also telling that when Nigel Farage called on Johnson to resign he was widely criticised by his own voters on social media. Furthermore, so long as Johnson appears sincere in his support for a \u2018meaningful\u2019, \u2018clean\u2019 or \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit then these Brexit party voters are instinctively on side. As polling made clear this week, 81% want Britain to leave with no deal while 91% would \u2018not be worried\u2019 if Britain left without a deal. Five years ago Ford and Goodwin co-wrote an acclaimed book on Ukip, Revolt on the Right. Since then some of their views have diverged. Mujtaba Rahman, the Brexit specialist at the Eurasia consultancy who produces regular briefing notes based on what he\u2019s been told by insiders in London and Brussels, has issued an update on the state of play this morning. He says he thinks the chances of the UK and the EU agreeing a deal this week are now \u201cclose to zero\u201d, and that the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening on 31 October are also \u201cextremely small\u201d. We\u2019re heading for an election, he assumes. Here\u2019s an extract. UK ministers admit privately there is little prospect of agreement. As one put it: \u201cIf the consent mechanism [on regulation] were the only problem, then a deal would be doable. But if we say Northern Ireland must be in the UK customs territory and the EU says it must be in the [EU] customs union, the problems are insurmountable. That\u2019s where we are.\u201d Downing Street\u2019s official line remains that the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal. At the same time, it insists the government \u201cwill obey\u201d the Benn Act approved by parliament, forcing Johnson to seek an extension to UK membership if a deal has not been approved by parliament by 19 October. Ministers refuse to say how these contradictory positions will be reconciled. Some admit privately they do not know. We think Johnson will pursue a strategy some aides describe as \u201cbeing dragged, kicking and screaming\u201d into an extension, so Leave voters know he is doing it against his will. This is why he still promises \u201cno delay\u201d even though he knows the prospects of a deal are remote. He may play for time on 19 October, so the Benn Act is tested in the courts (Johnson would swiftly be taken to court if he did not comply immediately). The courts could send a letter on the government\u2019s behalf, or order a civil servant or another minister to do so. Outright refusal to obey the law is a non-starter; it could provoke several resignations including those of Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, and Robert Buckland, the justice secretary. So we think that, sooner or later, Johnson will send the letter required by the act, but that too could be tested in the courts. It will likely describe the proposed delay as \u201cparliament\u2019s extension\u201d, not one sought by the government. This is from my colleague Severin Carrell. The lawyer Jolyon Maugham says he does not know what time the Scottish court judgment will be issued. I had been told 10am, but that may have been duff information. Politicians spend a lot of time in interviews dodging questions, but mostly they are not very good at it. They could all learn by watching Jennifer Arcuri, the American businesswoman at the centre of the scandal over claims that Boris Johnson improperly helped her company with grants and trade mission access when he was mayor of London because they had a very close friendship. She has given an interview to Good Morning Britain this morning, and she managed to give a non-answer that made her look strong and assertive, not weak and evasive. This is what she said when Piers Morgan asked her if she had ever had an intimate relationship with Johnson. She said: Because the press have made me this objectified ex-model pole dancer, I am really not going to answer that question ... I\u2019m sorry, I am not going to be putting myself in a position for you to weaponise my answer. I\u2019m being used as a pawn. This entire thing is a crazy charade. Arcuri also insisted that her firm had not received favours from Johnson. My colleague Matthew Weaver has written the whole interview up here. In normal circumstances this might be the story of the day, but the UK is only 24 days from a deadline that could pitch the country into a potentially crippling no-deal Brexit and Johnson has much more pressing things on his minds. His options might be affected by a decision in a Scottish court that could determine the extent to which he is constrained by the Benn Act. Here is the Press Association\u2019s preview story. A decision is expected to be made on whether the prime minister can be forced by the courts to send a letter requesting an article 50 extension. Documents submitted to the court of session on behalf of Boris Johnson were read out on Friday, in which he makes it clear he will not attempt to frustrate the so-called Benn Act. However, the petitioners believe No 10 cannot be trusted to abide by the law, so have launched legal action. The legislation, passed by Westminster last month, requires the prime minister to ask the EU for a Brexit extension to January 31 if parliament does not agree to any withdrawal deal Number 10 may come back with by October 19. Legal action - led by businessman Vince Dale, SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and Jolyon Maugham QC - was launched at the outer house of the court. It seeks to create an order which would force Johnson to send the letter and prohibits him from frustrating the Act\u2019s purpose. This includes banning him from asking EU member states to deny the letter\u2019s request or by sending an additional letter which contradicts it. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, representing the campaigners behind the legal action, claimed Johnson\u2019s previous statements go against what he has said to the court through the documents. He referred to promises made by the prime minister that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than send a letter requesting an extension, and that the UK will leave on October 31 \u201cdo or die\u201d. Judge Lord Pentland is expected to announce his decision on the case on Monday. And here is a blog from the Good Law Project, run by Maugham, explaining his case in more detail. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson visits a hospital in Watford. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 12pm: The court of session in Edinburgh is due to deliver its ruling in the legal challenge intended to ensure the PM complies with the Benn Act. 2.30pm: Therese Coffey takes work and pensions questions in the Commons. At some point Jeremy Corbyn is chairing another meeting of the opposition parties in Westminster, to discuss joint efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit. And opposition MPs may press for an emergency debate on a more to force the government to publish the full legal text of its Brexit plan. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

But the outgoing top police officer has launched an extraordinary critique of Sark, claiming it is \u201cawash\u201d with people who have criminal convictions and calling for his successors to be armed with batons and pepper spray. Mike Fawson, who has just completed a year as the elected conn\u00e9table (constable) on Sark, said the lack of a customs post meant there was no way of stopping drugs or other illegal goods being smuggled on to the tiny island. Though there are no cars on Sark and the population of a few hundred souls get around on horse-drawn carts, bicycles and tractors, Fawson called for the laws on driving under the influence to be tightened and for police to be kitted out with drink and drug driving testing kits and speed guns. Fawson said CCTV cameras should be set up at strategic locations, suggested underage drinking was widespread and claimed that a \u201ccode of silence\u201d made it very hard for people up to no good to be brought to justice. Day-to-day policing on Sark is done by the constable, a deputy (the vingtenier) and a small team of special constables, though if things get heated the island can ask nearby Guernsey for help. Fawson\u2019s warning to his fellow islanders was not universally popular.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/07/can-you-solve-it-getting-coins-out-of-the-bank\">Earlier today</a> I set you the following problem. It was a tricky one, and judging from the BTL comments the solution is eagerly awaited. Let me restate the problem before we get there. It concerns a game on a grid with an infinite<em> </em>number of rows and columns, and starts with three coins in the top left corner of the grid, as illustrated here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69f6b3dc1e0642d2ecbe6ad682c3fe2bd7e97ab6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69f6b3dc1e0642d2ecbe6ad682c3fe2bd7e97ab6/0_132_1888_1133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A snapshot of the top left of the grid, which has an infinite number of columns to the right, and an infinite number of rows below.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A snapshot of the top left of the grid, which has an infinite number of columns to the right, and an infinite number of rows below.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: alex bellos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The game has one move. At any moment you can remove any coin, and replace it with two coins, one in the cell immediately below the removed coin, and one in the cell immediately to the right of the removed coin. For example, just say we remove the coin two along on the top row, the grid will now look like this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7907ea2deb57f9f6d1aaf9bd77be7fac1824ea2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7907ea2deb57f9f6d1aaf9bd77be7fac1824ea2/0_27_744_543/500.jpg\" alt=\"x\" width=\"500\" height=\"365\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s one more thing. You are only allowed to remove a coin, in the way described above, if the cell below that coin and the cell to the right of that coin are empty. In other words, if a coin has an empty cell below it and an empty cell to its right, then you can remove that coin and replace it with two coins, one immediately below and one immediately to the right of the cell of the removed coin. That\u2019s it. There are no more rules. Let\u2019s redraw the initial grid with a red line separating the four cells in the upper left corner. These four cells are called the \u2018bank\u2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fb849cd56faeee6688506b612c769556ff47d6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fb849cd56faeee6688506b612c769556ff47d6e/0_60_1888_1133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>The challenge: design a strategy that gets all the coins out the bank. If you can\u2019t, prove that it is impossible.</em></p> <p><strong>Solution </strong></p> <p>If you tried playing around with coins on your desk, <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/334378520\">or on this interactive version</a>, you will have begun to suspect that moving all the coins from the bank is <em>not </em>possible. The coins quickly get gridlocked. </p> <p>In fact, these suspicions are correct: <strong>it is impossible to get all the coins out of the grid</strong>. How do we prove it? In other words, how to we show that whatever strategy we use to get the coins out the bank we are doomed to failure. </p> <p>Here\u2019s one way. (There may be others \u2013 and if you find one please describe it below the line). The proof I\u2019m going to describe here is beautiful and ingenious.

      "bodyText": "Earlier today I set you the following problem. It was a tricky one, and judging from the BTL comments the solution is eagerly awaited. Let me restate the problem before we get there. It concerns a game on a grid with an infinite number of rows and columns, and starts with three coins in the top left corner of the grid, as illustrated here. The game has one move. At any moment you can remove any coin, and replace it with two coins, one in the cell immediately below the removed coin, and one in the cell immediately to the right of the removed coin. For example, just say we remove the coin two along on the top row, the grid will now look like this: There\u2019s one more thing. You are only allowed to remove a coin, in the way described above, if the cell below that coin and the cell to the right of that coin are empty. In other words, if a coin has an empty cell below it and an empty cell to its right, then you can remove that coin and replace it with two coins, one immediately below and one immediately to the right of the cell of the removed coin. That\u2019s it. There are no more rules. Let\u2019s redraw the initial grid with a red line separating the four cells in the upper left corner. These four cells are called the \u2018bank\u2019. The challenge: design a strategy that gets all the coins out the bank. If you can\u2019t, prove that it is impossible. Solution If you tried playing around with coins on your desk, or on this interactive version, you will have begun to suspect that moving all the coins from the bank is not possible. The coins quickly get gridlocked. In fact, these suspicions are correct: it is impossible to get all the coins out of the grid. How do we prove it? In other words, how to we show that whatever strategy we use to get the coins out the bank we are doomed to failure. Here\u2019s one way. (There may be others \u2013 and if you find one please describe it below the line). The proof I\u2019m going to describe here is beautiful and ingenious. It relies on the concept of an \u2018invariant\u2019, a property that stays the same when certain other things change. Bear with me while we mark up the grid, as below. You will find out why we are doing this very shortly. Put the number 1 in the top left cell, as illustrated below. Let\u2019s call the number in any cell the weight of the cell. Let the cells below and to the right of the top left cell have a weight of 1/2. Fill in the rest of the grid by halving the weight each cell you go down, and halving the weight each cell you go across. Now we are ready for the great reveal! Our invariant is simply the weight of the cells with coins. I\u2019ll explain. Imagine a grid with a single coin in it, positioned in the top left cell. This cell has a weight of 1. When we remove it and replace it with a coin immediately below and immediately to the right, the grid now contains two coins, each on a (1/2)-cell. In other words, the weight of the cells with coins is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, by removing the coin and replacing it with two coins, as per the rules, the total weight of the occupied cells remains the same. In fact, whichever position a coin is in, replacing it with a coin below and a coin to the right makes no difference to the weight, because the labelling of the grid was deliberately done to make that the case. Take any cell, the weight of the cell below it, and of the cell to its right, is exactly half the weight of the original cell. So the sum of the weights of these two cells is equal to the weight of the original cell. We\u2019re almost there. Just a few things more to sort out. Let\u2019s calculate the weight of the entire grid. The first row is the infinite sum: 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + \u2026 = 2 The second row is 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + \u2026 = 1 The third row is 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + \u2026 = 1/2 Carrying on like this we see that when we count up the rows, the weight of the whole grid is: 2 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + \u2026 = 4 Even though the grid has an infinite number of cells, the total weight is finite. (I am assuming here that you know that the sum of 1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8\u2026 adds up to 1. An intuitive way to see this is to consider a whole cake. Eat half, and then half of what\u2019s left, and then half of what\u2019s left\u2026you will be eating 1/2, then 1/4, then 1/8, and so on, and in the limit you will have eaten the whole cake.) Now let\u2019s consider the weight of the bank: it is 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 9/4. This means that the weight of the grid outside the bank is 4 \u2013 9/4 = 7/4. Back to the question. We start with coins on three cells. These cells have a combined weight of 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 2. If there was a strategy to get all the coins out of the bank, this would mean it would be possible for there to be a placement of coins on cells outside the bank whose combined weight is 2. But this is is impossible, because the highest possible weight outside the bank is 7/4, which is less than 2, and you only get this high when every single cell outside the bank is occupied. In other words, there is no strategy to get all the coins out the bank. It does not exist! I hope you enjoyed today\u2019s puzzle. I\u2019ll be back in two weeks.

It\u2019s easy to imagine them dissecting the game, trying to work out what happened, although, let\u2019s face it, they probably had better things to talk about. If they were, they weren\u2019t the <br>only ones.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe result doesn\u2019t reflect the way the game was,\u201d said Sergio Reguil\u00f3n. \u201cThe punishment was too great: we had chances then Luis Su\u00e1rez scores an incredible goal and it ends,\u201d said Tomas Vaclik. \u201cI don\u2019t like using the word unfair, but we didn\u2019t deserve that,\u201d said Lopetegui. \u201cAlthough it was 4-0, I don\u2019t think we played badly,\u201d Nolito said. \u201cYou have so many chances and don\u2019t score, then they get three in 10 minutes.

Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde agreed. \u201cIn the first half, the score is pretty big for the way the game was,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had quite a lot of chances and they let us off. We were clinical, more than them.\u201d Sevilla\u2019s sporting director Monchi said he was heading home \u201cangry, sad\u201d, but insisted: \u201cI\u2019ve been here 20 or 25 times as a player and rarely had the feeling that we did as much as we did in the opening 25 minutes tonight.\u201d</p> \n<p>They were right, and maybe it was hard to explain. But it was also easy, maybe too easy, to explain. \u201cBarcelona have gunpowder,\u201d Sport said. And Sevilla don\u2019t. There was an inescapable truth to this result, a logic, familiarity. It was that kind of weekend, a <em>stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before</em>. Messi scored a free-kick, his <em>43rd</em> for Barcelona, his 15th in the last two years alone. He scored against Sevilla, making it 37 in 38 games against them. Su\u00e1rez smashed in an overhead kick, yet another volley to add to a collection that may have no equal anywhere, ever: that\u2019s his 21st since heading to Spain. Barcelona racked up the goals at the Camp Nou: five against Valencia, five against Betis, four against Sevilla. And, eight games in, the top three are <em>those three</em>, if not in the normal order.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1181180591078825984\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udc10 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Messi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Messi</a> career record vs Sevilla:<br><br>\ud83c\udfdf 38 games<br>\u26bd\ufe0f 37 goals<br>\ud83c\udfaf 5 Free-Kicks<br><br>Outrageous \ud83d\udd25<br>Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SquawkaFootball?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@squawkafootball</a> <br> <a href=\"https://t.co/xfy4y92AM3\">pic.twitter.com/xfy4y92AM3</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1181180591078825984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 7, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>There are doubts still, concerns about their continued inability to control games, but there is also comfort in that familiarity; in Messi completing 90 minutes and getting his first goal of the season; in Su\u00e1rez scoring out of nowhere again; in the way they ended the game, if not the way they started it. Comfort too in the success of the changes, the decisions that would have bitten Valverde if they hadn\u2019t worked: Frenkie De Jong in central midfield in place of Sergio Busquets; Vidal, always more than a mohican and tattoos that so few people can see beyond; Nelson Semedo at left back, and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, making his first start since the opening day, instead of Antoine Griezmann. All of the front three scored. More importantly, they combined. A more natural fit for the left wing, scorer of a lovely goal, the cut-back and finish, two-footed, very much his move, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is erratic but he\u2019s electric too. <br><br>He is also out again, and that too is familiar for a player for whom continuity and consistency remain elusive: come back in, immediately go back out again. Usually it\u2019s due to injury, this time he added insult, getting sent off in the last minute thanks to a second yellow for protesting against a red card handed to debutant Ronald Araujo by the referee Mateu Lahoz. Asked afterwards what Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 had said, Valverde replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery. You\u2019re doing well to get any phrase out of him in Spanish. It won\u2019t have been anything very long, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d <br><br>As it turned out, what he said was \u201c<em>muy malo\u2019\u2019</em>, very bad, which the consequences might well be: it\u2019s the <em>cl\u00e1sico</em> in two weeks.</p> \n<p>For Sevilla, there are doubts too, fears about the familiarity of all this. If the way it happened was different, the way it ended wasn\u2019t. As Estadio Deportivo put it, they had \u201cplayed like never before, and lost like normal\u201d. They have been beaten nine times in a row at the Camp Nou and haven\u2019t won there for 18 years. \u201cNo goals, but honour,\u201d the headline ran.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e42d882a3e98bd7c9b6de477b045fc7e5d401de8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e42d882a3e98bd7c9b6de477b045fc7e5d401de8/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luuk De Jong, Daniel Carrico and Diego Carlos left to rue their missed opportunities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luuk De Jong, Daniel Carrico and Diego Carlos left to rue their missed opportunities.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bagu Blanco/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The problem is, that no goals may not just be down to bad luck \u2013 although there was plenty of it. This is a new Sevilla, the first of the second coming of Monchi, a team containing 13 new players after 15 departed, and it is early to judge them. There is much that is good, they were superb <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/30/sevilla-and-sociedads-%20special-show-puts-madrid-derby-in-shade\">against Real Sociedad last week</a>, and Monchi was entitled to insist that he could see a team that \u201cknows what it wants\u201d at the Camp Nou. Joan Jordan has impressed, Banega has found his place, freed up by Fernando, and although they let in four, Diego Carlos has had a good start. Lucas Ocampos tore into Barcelona, as he has done to others. And the full-backs, Jes\u00fas Navas and Reguil\u00f3n, are flying. But up front it\u2019s not happening. \u201cDe Jong had four chances and didn\u2019t score, Su\u00e1rez had none and did,\u201d Marca said, saying it all. Swap the strikers round and you might have swapped the scoreline around. <br><br>This is a recurring issue, so much so that it hints at a systemic one, or the kind of serendipity that can sink you. Lopetegui has been to the Camp Nou twice as a manager now, a year apart \u2013 first with Madrid and then with Sevilla. The stats show that his teams have fired off 31 shots, and faced 28. They have lost 5-1 and 4-0. None of Sevilla\u2019s centre forwards have scored in the league this season: Munir Haddadi, Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and De Jong have no league goals; Munas Dabbur, signed for \u20ac15m, has no league minutes.</p> \n<p>They got 60 league goals between them last season, and De Jong scored over 100 at PSV, but it\u2019s different now. No one has taken more shots without scoring than De Jong, likened in El Mundo to the tortured protagonist of a Dostoyevsky novel. Even at 3-0, there was no consolation, no light. Clean through, having robbed the ball and made the opportunity himself, he took aim for the 18th time of the season, the fourth of the night.</p> \n<p>The ball bounced back off the post and away.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Villarreal led Osasuna 1-0 but didn\u2019t win, losing 2-1 with the winner scored by the brilliant Chimy Avila, with his short shorts, big heart, black boots, endless tattoos and oversized lungs.

To still get it wrong. In the worst, but not the only case, at Butarque, where Legan\u00e9s have demanded their defeat by Levante get replayed after a penalty was given for a foul that, if it happened at all, happened outside the area. They claim the system failed; the Federation claims it didn\u2019t. And so the war rumbles on, this time with referees and their videos in the middle, weaponised again.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Iago Aspas is back. He scored his first of the season to beat Athletic and rescued Fran Escrib\u00e1\u2019s job. But it\u2019s hard to see Espanyol manager David Gallego making it to the next match day.</p> \n<p>\u2022 There were more protests at Mestalla, despite attempts to hide them. President Anil Murthy responded to chants for Peter Lim to leave and for him to \u201cget out\u201d \u2013 chants that called him \u201cscum\u201d \u2013 by signalling for them to fall silent and pointing at the pitch, telling them to support the team.

Which is why he departed the Camp Nou \u201cdestroyed\u201d despite his team having not been destroyed at all, and that might just have hurt even more. Some days your Luuk\u2019s just not in, and Sunday was one of those days: the worrying thing is that it wasn\u2019t the only one of them. Thirty-five minutes into the weekend\u2019s biggest match, the one that had seemed set to decide just how good Sevilla were, how good manager Julen Lopetegui and his new project is too, striker Luuk de Jong alone had enjoyed more chances than the entire Barcelona team. He was also losing 3-0. By the end, it was 4-0. \u201cWe\u2019re pissed off but football\u2019s like that,\u201d Nolito said. Sunday\u2019s match had gone Sevilla, Sevilla, Sevilla, Sevilla, oh look Barcelona are 3-0 up, the rough notes genuinely reading: \u201c10. De Jong, good save Ter Stegen / 17. Great chance De Jong / 25. What a miss! De Jong.\u201d And then: \u201c27. Great goal Su\u00e1rez.\u201d Quickly followed by a second from Arturo Vidal and a lovely finish from Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 that ended it. Sevilla had taken the game to Barcelona and Barcelona had taken it from Sevilla: seven minutes, 54 seconds \u2013 celebrations, VAR checks and sundry faffing all included \u2013 and it was as over, three shots enough. A story in short scribbles continued \u201c58. 6-13 shots Sevilla / Chances: 3-4 / 59. Messi madness / Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 playing well / De Jong off,\u201d before ending on: \u201c4-0 Messi, he\u2019s back.\u201d There\u2019s a nice photo from after the match in which \u00c9ver Banega and Lionel Messi sit together on the stairs in the tunnel at the Camp Nou near where the chapel is, just the two of them, shirts off and handed over to each other, chatting. It\u2019s easy to imagine them dissecting the game, trying to work out what happened, although, let\u2019s face it, they probably had better things to talk about. If they were, they weren\u2019t the only ones. \u201cThe result doesn\u2019t reflect the way the game was,\u201d said Sergio Reguil\u00f3n. \u201cThe punishment was too great: we had chances then Luis Su\u00e1rez scores an incredible goal and it ends,\u201d said Tomas Vaclik. \u201cI don\u2019t like using the word unfair, but we didn\u2019t deserve that,\u201d said Lopetegui. \u201cAlthough it was 4-0, I don\u2019t think we played badly,\u201d Nolito said. \u201cYou have so many chances and don\u2019t score, then they get three in 10 minutes. They put their first chance away and then we were going against the tide.\u201d It just wasn\u2019t their night. Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde agreed. \u201cIn the first half, the score is pretty big for the way the game was,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had quite a lot of chances and they let us off. We were clinical, more than them.\u201d Sevilla\u2019s sporting director Monchi said he was heading home \u201cangry, sad\u201d, but insisted: \u201cI\u2019ve been here 20 or 25 times as a player and rarely had the feeling that we did as much as we did in the opening 25 minutes tonight.\u201d They were right, and maybe it was hard to explain. But it was also easy, maybe too easy, to explain. \u201cBarcelona have gunpowder,\u201d Sport said. And Sevilla don\u2019t. There was an inescapable truth to this result, a logic, familiarity. It was that kind of weekend, a stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before. Messi scored a free-kick, his 43rd for Barcelona, his 15th in the last two years alone. He scored against Sevilla, making it 37 in 38 games against them. Su\u00e1rez smashed in an overhead kick, yet another volley to add to a collection that may have no equal anywhere, ever: that\u2019s his 21st since heading to Spain. Barcelona racked up the goals at the Camp Nou: five against Valencia, five against Betis, four against Sevilla. And, eight games in, the top three are those three, if not in the normal order. There are doubts still, concerns about their continued inability to control games, but there is also comfort in that familiarity; in Messi completing 90 minutes and getting his first goal of the season; in Su\u00e1rez scoring out of nowhere again; in the way they ended the game, if not the way they started it. Comfort too in the success of the changes, the decisions that would have bitten Valverde if they hadn\u2019t worked: Frenkie De Jong in central midfield in place of Sergio Busquets; Vidal, always more than a mohican and tattoos that so few people can see beyond; Nelson Semedo at left back, and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, making his first start since the opening day, instead of Antoine Griezmann. All of the front three scored. More importantly, they combined. A more natural fit for the left wing, scorer of a lovely goal, the cut-back and finish, two-footed, very much his move, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is erratic but he\u2019s electric too. He is also out again, and that too is familiar for a player for whom continuity and consistency remain elusive: come back in, immediately go back out again. Usually it\u2019s due to injury, this time he added insult, getting sent off in the last minute thanks to a second yellow for protesting against a red card handed to debutant Ronald Araujo by the referee Mateu Lahoz. Asked afterwards what Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 had said, Valverde replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery. You\u2019re doing well to get any phrase out of him in Spanish. It won\u2019t have been anything very long, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d As it turned out, what he said was \u201cmuy malo\u2019\u2019, very bad, which the consequences might well be: it\u2019s the cl\u00e1sico in two weeks. For Sevilla, there are doubts too, fears about the familiarity of all this. If the way it happened was different, the way it ended wasn\u2019t. As Estadio Deportivo put it, they had \u201cplayed like never before, and lost like normal\u201d. They have been beaten nine times in a row at the Camp Nou and haven\u2019t won there for 18 years. \u201cNo goals, but honour,\u201d the headline ran. The problem is, that no goals may not just be down to bad luck \u2013 although there was plenty of it. This is a new Sevilla, the first of the second coming of Monchi, a team containing 13 new players after 15 departed, and it is early to judge them. There is much that is good, they were superb against Real Sociedad last week, and Monchi was entitled to insist that he could see a team that \u201cknows what it wants\u201d at the Camp Nou. Joan Jordan has impressed, Banega has found his place, freed up by Fernando, and although they let in four, Diego Carlos has had a good start. Lucas Ocampos tore into Barcelona, as he has done to others. And the full-backs, Jes\u00fas Navas and Reguil\u00f3n, are flying. But up front it\u2019s not happening. \u201cDe Jong had four chances and didn\u2019t score, Su\u00e1rez had none and did,\u201d Marca said, saying it all. Swap the strikers round and you might have swapped the scoreline around. This is a recurring issue, so much so that it hints at a systemic one, or the kind of serendipity that can sink you. Lopetegui has been to the Camp Nou twice as a manager now, a year apart \u2013 first with Madrid and then with Sevilla. The stats show that his teams have fired off 31 shots, and faced 28. They have lost 5-1 and 4-0. None of Sevilla\u2019s centre forwards have scored in the league this season: Munir Haddadi, Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and De Jong have no league goals; Munas Dabbur, signed for \u20ac15m, has no league minutes. They got 60 league goals between them last season, and De Jong scored over 100 at PSV, but it\u2019s different now. No one has taken more shots without scoring than De Jong, likened in El Mundo to the tortured protagonist of a Dostoyevsky novel. Even at 3-0, there was no consolation, no light. Clean through, having robbed the ball and made the opportunity himself, he took aim for the 18th time of the season, the fourth of the night. The ball bounced back off the post and away. Talking points \u2022 Villarreal led Osasuna 1-0 but didn\u2019t win, losing 2-1 with the winner scored by the brilliant Chimy Avila, with his short shorts, big heart, black boots, endless tattoos and oversized lungs. Villarreal, who have more players in the Spanish squad than Barcelona, Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico combined, have now led in seven of their eight games and won only three. Meanwhile, Osasuna won again at El Sadar, the stadium where they haven\u2019t lost in 29 matches. \u2022 Real Madrid led 3-2, but like the day against Levante, almost got caught, hanging on to beat Granada 4-2. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d Dani Carvajal said, drawing the parallel to Levante without prompting. \u2022 Atl\u00e9tico didn\u2019t concede for the fourth game running. But they didn\u2019t score either. Eight games in, it\u2019s their worst goalscoring start in the Diego Simeone era, hardly known for its all-out attacking anyway. \u2022 And VAR took ages. To still get it wrong. In the worst, but not the only case, at Butarque, where Legan\u00e9s have demanded their defeat by Levante get replayed after a penalty was given for a foul that, if it happened at all, happened outside the area. They claim the system failed; the Federation claims it didn\u2019t. And so the war rumbles on, this time with referees and their videos in the middle, weaponised again. \u2022 Iago Aspas is back. He scored his first of the season to beat Athletic and rescued Fran Escrib\u00e1\u2019s job. But it\u2019s hard to see Espanyol manager David Gallego making it to the next match day. \u2022 There were more protests at Mestalla, despite attempts to hide them. President Anil Murthy responded to chants for Peter Lim to leave and for him to \u201cget out\u201d \u2013 chants that called him \u201cscum\u201d \u2013 by signalling for them to fall silent and pointing at the pitch, telling them to support the team. Valencia weren\u2019t great but did win 2-1 against Alav\u00e9s.",

He was described by Crewe in a statement announcing his retirement as \u201cthe club\u2019s most successful manager having won four promotions, most notably guiding the club into the second tier of English football in 1997 and again in 2003\u201d.</p> <p>Gradi was awarded an OBE for services to football in 1998 and, making no mention of his suspension in their statement, the club added: \u201cCrewe Alexandra would like to thank Dario for his outstanding 36 years of service to the football club and are pleased to know that he would be happy to continue to assist the club\u2019s senior coaching staff with his invaluable experience in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Officially, however, Gradi\u2019s suspension means he is not allowed to take part in any football-related activities and his position has appeared untenable since Charles Geekie, the QC who was appointed to oversee the Chelsea inquiry, delivered his report.</p> <p>Geekie led a 17-strong legal team that dealt with eight police forces and conducted 139 interviews before reaching his findings. Gradi, Geekie wrote, had given \u201csomewhat unlikely and unconvincing\u201d evidence.</p> <p>\u201cMr Gradi is the single example of a clear account of an adult in a position of responsibility being informed about an allegation in relation to Mr Heath. The complaint \u2026 was not referred to more senior members of the club and an opportunity to prevent Mr Heath from going on to abuse others was lost.</p> <p>\u201cThe very purpose of this review is to shine a light on matters such as this. The events involving Mr Gradi are central to the purpose of this review. There is, I consider, a significant public interest in matters such as this being brought fully and openly into view. I consider it absolutely necessary \u2026 to name Mr Gradi.\u201d</p> <p>Bennell, who was appointed by Gradi as Crewe\u2019s youth-team coach, was described by the prosecution as an \u201cindustrial-scale child molester\u201d and a \u201cpredatory and determined paedophile\u201d during a trial in early 2018 that concluded with him being found guilty of 50 specimen charges of raping and molesting 12 junior footballers, aged eight to 14, from 1979 to 1990. It is his fourth prison sentence, three in England and one in the US, and he is now facing the possibility of more charges.</p> <p>Greg Clarke, the chairman of the Football Association, described the \u201ctidal wave\u201d of other reports of sexual abuse as the biggest crisis he could remember in the sport and another QC, Clive Sheldon, has been putting together a full report which is also likely to look at Gradi\u2019s association with Bennell.

      "bodyText": "Dario Gradi has officially ended his long and chequered career in football after nearly three years of being suspended from his role at Crewe Alexandra, amid continuing questions about his conduct as a work colleague of two of the sport\u2019s worst paedophiles. Gradi, 78, was suspended by the Football Association in December 2016 after the Guardian\u2019s interview with a former Crewe player, Andy Woodward, enveloped the fourth-tier club in scandal and led to Barry Bennell, one of their former coaches, being jailed for 31 years. Gradi had always denied any wrongdoing but has faced calls from Bennell\u2019s victims, all former junior players at Crewe and Manchester City, for his resignation, having raised serious questions about what he knew and what he did about it. In August, an independent inquiry into a separate abuse scandal concluded that Gradi had information that might have stopped another serial abuser who was feared to have preyed on more than 25 victims. According to the findings of a two-and-a-half-year investigation, Gradi failed to report one of Chelsea\u2019s scouts, Eddie Heath, when they worked together in the early 1970s, despite receiving a complaint that his colleague had indecently assaulted one boy in the showers. Instead Gradi, then Chelsea\u2019s assistant manager, visited the boy\u2019s parents and admitted in his own evidence to the inquiry that he did not want the matter to go any further. \u201cI\u2019d got no intention of getting Eddie Heath into trouble,\u201d he said. Gradi joined Crewe in 1983 and had 24 years and more than 1,000 first-team games as manager, as well as having a spell as managing director and, latterly, director of football. He was described by Crewe in a statement announcing his retirement as \u201cthe club\u2019s most successful manager having won four promotions, most notably guiding the club into the second tier of English football in 1997 and again in 2003\u201d. Gradi was awarded an OBE for services to football in 1998 and, making no mention of his suspension in their statement, the club added: \u201cCrewe Alexandra would like to thank Dario for his outstanding 36 years of service to the football club and are pleased to know that he would be happy to continue to assist the club\u2019s senior coaching staff with his invaluable experience in the future.\u201d Officially, however, Gradi\u2019s suspension means he is not allowed to take part in any football-related activities and his position has appeared untenable since Charles Geekie, the QC who was appointed to oversee the Chelsea inquiry, delivered his report. Geekie led a 17-strong legal team that dealt with eight police forces and conducted 139 interviews before reaching his findings. Gradi, Geekie wrote, had given \u201csomewhat unlikely and unconvincing\u201d evidence. \u201cMr Gradi is the single example of a clear account of an adult in a position of responsibility being informed about an allegation in relation to Mr Heath. The complaint \u2026 was not referred to more senior members of the club and an opportunity to prevent Mr Heath from going on to abuse others was lost. \u201cThe very purpose of this review is to shine a light on matters such as this. The events involving Mr Gradi are central to the purpose of this review. There is, I consider, a significant public interest in matters such as this being brought fully and openly into view. I consider it absolutely necessary \u2026 to name Mr Gradi.\u201d Bennell, who was appointed by Gradi as Crewe\u2019s youth-team coach, was described by the prosecution as an \u201cindustrial-scale child molester\u201d and a \u201cpredatory and determined paedophile\u201d during a trial in early 2018 that concluded with him being found guilty of 50 specimen charges of raping and molesting 12 junior footballers, aged eight to 14, from 1979 to 1990. It is his fourth prison sentence, three in England and one in the US, and he is now facing the possibility of more charges. Greg Clarke, the chairman of the Football Association, described the \u201ctidal wave\u201d of other reports of sexual abuse as the biggest crisis he could remember in the sport and another QC, Clive Sheldon, has been putting together a full report which is also likely to look at Gradi\u2019s association with Bennell. That is expected to be released next year.",

The commissioners countered that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had on occasion been deemed to be at risk of self harm so could not be given medication. The account of her hearing came from British sources, and cannot be independently verified. It also came as two Australians were released from jail in Tehran in a prisoner swap, and the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, claimed two detained Iranians were being released by the US. She disputed the commissioners\u2019 explanation for the deprivation of medicines, saying some of the prescribed medicines had never been provided and if she wanted to self-harm she could have used other means. In a letter smuggled out of her prison cell last week, Zaghari-Ratcliffe also wrote of her desperation at being separated from her five-year-old daughter, Gabriella, who is due to return to London thisautumn to start school and be cared for by her husband.

After returning to her cell she was reportedly in tears for an hour. She has been given no indication of when the Iranian judiciary will decide on her appeal. The Tehran hearing came as Iran failed to win the UK high court\u2019s permission to appeal against a judgment debarring it from claiming up to \u00a320m interest from the UK government over an unpaid \u00a3400m debt. The debt, or court award, originated from the non-delivery of contracts to the Iranian ministry of defence (Modsaf) of Chieftain tanks dating back to before 1979. The UK refused to complete the contract after the Shah was deposed, even though Iran had paid the money. Phillips ruled Iran had no serious chance of succeeding at appeal on the question of a right to interest on the debt since the body to which the award is payable has been a EU-sanctioned entity since 2008. The ruling is a reverse for Iran in its marathon court battle to enforce an international court order dating back to 2012 awarding Iran \u00a3400m over the UK\u2019s government\u2019s non-completion of the contract to provide Iran with Chieftain tanks. The UK has put nearly \u00a3500m into court as a surety for the award, but insists it cannot make the payment, let alone pay any interest accrued since 2008, on the grounds that Modsaf is a sanctioned entity. The case affects UK bilateral relations, and despite denials by both the British and Iranian governments is seen as a possible barrier to the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Her plight was not mentioned in Sunday\u2019s hearing seeking permission to appeal. Iran has two major routes left to unlock the cash put into court by the UK.

The Central Bank is not an EU-sanctioned entity. Iran lodged its appeal in writing two years ago, but no ruling has emerged from the OFSI. In addition, Iran is due to seek a UK court judgment in a case set for March directing the UK to pay the \u00a3400m award into the coffers of the Central Bank. Lawyers for the UK government in court made clear to Justice Phillips that they will resist any requirement to pay the money to the Central Bank either in cash or kind since the ultimate beneficiary will in effect be Modsaf. In theory, the UK would be free after Brexit to change the list of bodies it sanctions, rather than simply duplicate EU decisions, but there is no sign that ministers will make any change to the Iranian sanctions regime.

Your first thoughts might be: this seems like a niche interest. But it\u2019s the spark for a piece of theatre that speaks to something universal and pressing, about the rights of women over their own bodies, the ramifications of digital life, and that knotty old question: can it ever be empowering for a woman to take her clothes off in public?</p> <p>Shasha plays Miranda, a woman appalled to discover her artist daughter Olivia (Taylor) has been posting semi-naked pictures of herself online. Their ensuing standoff is a primer on contemporary feminism and navigating sexuality in the internet age. That the pair have done their homework is evident (thinkers from Andrea Dworkin to Beyonc\u00e9 are namechecked) and the occasionally heavy-handed script can be self-consciously learned, but the fact is it\u2019s fascinating territory, constantly evolving and full of complexity.</p> <p>The pair act out an unusually frank but believable mother-daughter bond, the calm self-possession of Taylor, 25, versus the fraught energy of Shasha, 53. The aerialism is contemplative and illustrative, the umbilical attachment of mother and daughter stretching as the girl grows up, or Miranda tying herself in literal as well as figurative knots with the argument at hand.

      "body": "<h2><strong>THE FLOP FOUR</strong></h2> <p>The Fiver hasn\u2019t had a wink of sleep, reader \u2013 and not for the usual reason involving our weird uncle inviting the degenerates back from the drinker for an impromptu Zumba session in the spare room at 1am. No, the Premier League crisis-club klaxon has been sounding loudly all weekend and we\u2019re more frazzled than a corn-based snack we\u2019re not sure even exists any more. With Tottenham having been ravaged by Bayern last week, Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side needed to soothe the wounds with a restorative trip to the seaside on Saturday. Instead, it was the worst trip to Brighton by a Londoner since Phil Daniels went looking for his idol Sting only to suffer the dream-crushing horror of finding him dressed as a strait-laced bellboy in the latter scenes of Quadrophenia.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/06/mauricio-pochettino-brojken-spurs-tottenham-lowest-ebb\">A thorough pecking by the Seagulls</a> leaves sorry Spurs marooned in mid-table behind West Ham, Burnley and sixth-placed Crystal Palace. \u201cIn the last five days we were really punched by football, 7-2 and 3-0. You don\u2019t feel good in those moments,\u201d shrugged Pochettino, who has had the look of a demoralised mod heading for the rocks on a stolen scooter himself for most of the season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/07/premier-league-10-talking-points-manchester-city-aaron-connolly-marco-silva\">Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another manager who appeared to be having a Fiver-style existential crisis at the weekend was Toffees boss Magic Marco. No club does full-on emergency in October quite like Everton and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/burnley-everton-premier-league-match-report\">their 1-0 defeat at Burnley</a> on Saturday saw the sorry Blues sink into the relegation zone. With his expensively-assembled team having shuffled off to the Turf Moor changing rooms quick-sharp to avoid a barracking by incensed travelling Evertonians at full-time, it was left to poor Marco to face them on his own. A vision of 2,300 V for victory signs greeted him. Was he worried about his losing streak? \u201cNever, never, never!\u201d roared Marco. \u201cI never lose my desire, and I never lose what is important in my job.\u201d If he still has a job after the international break, he might want to put that \u201cimportant\u2019 thing to better use against West Ham.</p> <p>On Sunday, the klaxon blared louder still, with Manchester City\u2019s 2-0 loss at home to Wolves meaning they\u2019re only one bad result away from falling behind Arsenal in the league. Yes, Arsenal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/06/manchester-city-not-out-of-title-race-despite-nervous-defeat-says-guardiola\">Oh Pep</a>!

With Bernard Cribbins having spent most of last week trying to avoid his players after the 5-0 defeat at Leicester, surely Newcastle were there for the taking? Nope, Manchester United were outthought and outfought by a side powered by the busiest Geordie duo since Ant and Dec. Matty and Sean Longstaff bossed the game, though who exactly was playing in Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s midfield is still a mystery given they spent most of the game hiding behind Scott McTominay. Next up for Manchester United are Liverpool, pretty much the only Premier League team that hasn\u2019t had a crisis yet. But will Ole <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1104018088050208768\">still be at the wheel</a>?</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cIt would be easy for me to blame the goalkeeper in the last however many games, I\u2019m not that type of person, I\u2019m not that type of coach.

      "bodyText": "THE FLOP FOUR The Fiver hasn\u2019t had a wink of sleep, reader \u2013 and not for the usual reason involving our weird uncle inviting the degenerates back from the drinker for an impromptu Zumba session in the spare room at 1am. No, the Premier League crisis-club klaxon has been sounding loudly all weekend and we\u2019re more frazzled than a corn-based snack we\u2019re not sure even exists any more. With Tottenham having been ravaged by Bayern last week, Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side needed to soothe the wounds with a restorative trip to the seaside on Saturday. Instead, it was the worst trip to Brighton by a Londoner since Phil Daniels went looking for his idol Sting only to suffer the dream-crushing horror of finding him dressed as a strait-laced bellboy in the latter scenes of Quadrophenia. A thorough pecking by the Seagulls leaves sorry Spurs marooned in mid-table behind West Ham, Burnley and sixth-placed Crystal Palace. \u201cIn the last five days we were really punched by football, 7-2 and 3-0. You don\u2019t feel good in those moments,\u201d shrugged Pochettino, who has had the look of a demoralised mod heading for the rocks on a stolen scooter himself for most of the season. Another manager who appeared to be having a Fiver-style existential crisis at the weekend was Toffees boss Magic Marco. No club does full-on emergency in October quite like Everton and their 1-0 defeat at Burnley on Saturday saw the sorry Blues sink into the relegation zone. With his expensively-assembled team having shuffled off to the Turf Moor changing rooms quick-sharp to avoid a barracking by incensed travelling Evertonians at full-time, it was left to poor Marco to face them on his own. A vision of 2,300 V for victory signs greeted him. Was he worried about his losing streak? \u201cNever, never, never!\u201d roared Marco. \u201cI never lose my desire, and I never lose what is important in my job.\u201d If he still has a job after the international break, he might want to put that \u201cimportant\u2019 thing to better use against West Ham. On Sunday, the klaxon blared louder still, with Manchester City\u2019s 2-0 loss at home to Wolves meaning they\u2019re only one bad result away from falling behind Arsenal in the league. Yes, Arsenal. Oh Pep! But trust Manchester United to hog the headlines again by suffering defeat at a club like no other \u2013 Newcastle United. With Bernard Cribbins having spent most of last week trying to avoid his players after the 5-0 defeat at Leicester, surely Newcastle were there for the taking? Nope, Manchester United were outthought and outfought by a side powered by the busiest Geordie duo since Ant and Dec. Matty and Sean Longstaff bossed the game, though who exactly was playing in Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s midfield is still a mystery given they spent most of the game hiding behind Scott McTominay. Next up for Manchester United are Liverpool, pretty much the only Premier League team that hasn\u2019t had a crisis yet. But will Ole still be at the wheel? QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt would be easy for me to blame the goalkeeper in the last however many games, I\u2019m not that type of person, I\u2019m not that type of coach. Today, I can\u2019t defend him, it\u2019s two goalkeeping errors, that\u2019s the truth, we got beat 2-0 because of two goalkeeping errors, that are basics of the game \u2026 I\u2019ve never seen two goals like that in my life. Simon goes away with the Croatian national team, it might do him the world of good to get a break from everybody\u201d \u2013 Luton boss Graeme Jones isn\u2019t the type of coach to give it out to Simon Sluga after the 2-0 defeat at Derby, including this belter. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Football Weekly will be around this way. FIVER LETTERS \u201cAs a culturally deficient American, I could hardly understand any of Jesse Marsch\u2019s half-time Anfield team talk (Friday\u2019s Fiver) and was about to label him a treasonous globalist before he sprinkled in a few f-bombs and platitudes about trying harder. It may have been articulated in a few different languages, but the sentiment was very much American indeed. What an effing patriot!\u201d \u2013 Jeff Thomas. \u201cOK yes, I did Google \u2018totes stegosaurus\u2019 to see if it\u2019s a thing (Friday\u2019s Fiver), and no, it isn\u2019t. Damn you. Although I did find a natty line of stegosaurus totes\u201d \u2013 Matt Hockey. \u201cAfter enduring Newcastle United v Manchester United on Sunday, my irritation levels only rose further after hearing Bernard Cribbins attain Alanis Morrisette levels of incomprehension of the English language with: \u2018It\u2019s quite ironic Matty Longstaff\u2019s beat Manchester United in his first game, I\u2019ve been trying for 20-odd years.\u2019 As an acclaimed writer, Cribbins should know better\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Dario Gradi has retired from working at Crewe Alexandra. Aston Villa are \u201cdisgusted and appalled\u201d by footage which appears to show fans chanting a racist song about two of their own players. Big Phil Neville is feeling some heat after England Women\u2019s latest setback, a 2-1 home doing by Brazil. \u201cI think I\u2019m being judged on it now,\u201d he parped. \u201cWe have to win games. It\u2019s not just a \u2018let\u2019s just keep everybody happy\u2019 type role. The FA wants me to win matches, so I want to be judged like any other manager.\u201d Everton midfielder Fabian Delph is out of the England squad after suffering hamstring-twang and will miss the Euro 2020 qualifier dates with the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. Meanwhile, the national police lead officer for football has revealed he urged Uefa not to stage Friday night\u2019s game in Prague, amid fears the timing would increase the extent of drunken and antisocial behaviour. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate because you can foresee the risk,\u201d sighed Mark Roberts. Hugo Lloris will spend at least two months engaged in small-talk with Spurs physios after suffering elbow-yikes at Brighton.

This is Fanny Tilson, the wife of Henry Austen\u2019s business partner, James Tilson, who had given birth to at least 11 children by that point. Austen finds her \u201cas affectionate &amp; pleasing as ever\u201d, but notes to her sister that \u201cfrom her appearance I suspect her to be in the family way. Poor Woman!\u201d</p> <p>With just a few words, the novelist conjures up for her sister an image of her situation: \u201cWe are now all four of us young Ladies sitting round the Circular Table in the inner room writing our Letters, while the two Brothers are having a comfortable coze in the room adjoining.\u201d This use of \u201ccoze\u201d predates the word\u2019s first recorded appearance in print \u2013 in Austen\u2019s own novel Mansfield Park, in 1814.</p> <p>Austen also takes a deep dive into the world of headgear. \u201cMy cap is come home, and I like it very much,\u201d she informs Cassandra. \u201cFanny has one also; hers is white sarsenet and lace, of a different shape from mine, more fit for morning carriage wear, which is what it is intended for, and is in shape exceedingly like our own satin and lace of last winter; shaped around the face exactly like it, with pipes and more fulness, and a round crown inserted behind. My cap has a peak in front. Large full bows of very narrow ribbon (old twopenny) are the thing. One over the right temple, perhaps, and another at the left ear.\u201d</p> <p>Bonhams believes the<a href=\"https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/25263/lot/5/\"> letter, which has been in a private collection since 1909, will fetch between \u00a365,000 to \u00a397,000 at auction</a>. Sutherland said that \u201cbecause of specific domestic details within it, it would have by far the greatest resonance inside the collection held by Jane Austen\u2019s House Museum in the cottage where Austen lived and wrote\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the museum launched a crowdfunding campaign to help it raise the \u00a335,000 it needed to buy a snippet of a letter written by Austen in 1814. More than 250 donors <a href=\"https://www.jane-austens-house-museum.org.uk/single-post/2019/08/20/Jane-Austens-House-Museum-saves-precious-Austen-letter-after-fundraising-appeal-hits-target\">raised \u00a310,000 in a public campaign in </a><a href=\"https://www.jane-austens-house-museum.org.uk/single-post/2019/08/20/Jane-Austens-House-Museum-saves-precious-Austen-letter-after-fundraising-appeal-hits-target\">six weeks</a> and it is on display at the museum.</p> <p>Sutherland said it was particularly sad that publicly funded organisations like Jane Austen\u2019s House Museum were unable to compete with international commercial buyers, \u201cbecause so few Austen letters are retained for public benefit in British institutions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf the present owners had consulted privately with us of course we would have been happy to try to reach a mutually fair accommodation, but auction house prices do not sit well with what public institutions can in most cases afford to offer,\u201d she said.</p>",

One over the right temple, perhaps, and another at the left ear.\u201d Bonhams believes the letter, which has been in a private collection since 1909, will fetch between \u00a365,000 to \u00a397,000 at auction. Sutherland said that \u201cbecause of specific domestic details within it, it would have by far the greatest resonance inside the collection held by Jane Austen\u2019s House Museum in the cottage where Austen lived and wrote\u201d. Earlier this year, the museum launched a crowdfunding campaign to help it raise the \u00a335,000 it needed to buy a snippet of a letter written by Austen in 1814. More than 250 donors raised \u00a310,000 in a public campaign in six weeks and it is on display at the museum. Sutherland said it was particularly sad that publicly funded organisations like Jane Austen\u2019s House Museum were unable to compete with international commercial buyers, \u201cbecause so few Austen letters are retained for public benefit in British institutions\u201d. \u201cIf the present owners had consulted privately with us of course we would have been happy to try to reach a mutually fair accommodation, but auction house prices do not sit well with what public institutions can in most cases afford to offer,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>Transplanting vaginal fluids from one woman to another could help tackle severe cases of a common bacterial condition, a study has suggested.</p> <p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is thought to affect up to a third of women of reproductive age. It is caused when the balance of microbes in the vagina \u2013 known as the vaginal microbiome \u2013 becomes disturbed, with a drop in lactobacilli while other bacteria take over.</p> <p>The condition is not generally serious, but it can increase the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, and of complications for pregnant women. It can also affect self-esteem; some women develop symptoms such as fishy-smelling discharge.</p> <p>While BV can often be treated with antibiotics, in some women it recurs just weeks or months later meaning a steady dose of antibiotics might be necessary.</p> <p>Now a small study has suggested severe BV could be treated by transplanting vaginal fluids from women containing a \u201chealthy\u201d collection of microbes.</p> <p>Prof Eran Elinav, co-author of the study from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, said the procedure could help address a large unmet need.</p> <p>\u201cBy introducing this new treatment approach, we hope that we may come a step closer to providing an affordable solution for the very many millions of women across the world that suffer with this disorder,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0600-6\">Writing in the journal Nature Medicine</a>, Elinav and colleagues report how they carried out the procedure on five women aged between 27 and 47, all of whom had recurring BV and took regular antibiotics for the condition \u2013 drugs they stopped taking during the study.</p> <p>A week before the procedure, each woman was given antibiotic creams to at least partially clear existing bacteria in the vagina.</p> <p>The team then collected vaginal fluids from three donor women and transferred a sample to each recipient . All participants had been carefully screened for infections.</p> <p>The recipients were then examined in a series of subsequent appointments to see if their condition improved and whether BV recurred. If it did, the women were given a further transplant.</p> <p>The results reveal four of the recipients showed long-term improvements, with two requiring just one transplant and the others having three transplants each. After their last transplant, none of the four had a recurrence of BV for the remainder of the study \u2013 a period of between five months and 21 months depending on the recipient. Further analysis showed a dramatic and sustained change in the recipients\u2019 vaginal microbiome after successful transplant, with it becoming very similar to that of their donor\u2019s vaginal fluids and rich in lactobacilli. None of the women suffered any adverse effects.</p> <p>\u201cWith this friendly microbiome takeover, symptoms and complications associated with BV rapidly subside,\u201d said Elinav.</p> <p>The remaining recipient showed partial improvement after two transplants.. </p> <p>The team say the approach now needs to be explored in much larger clinical trials and compared with a placebo, while potential long-term consequences and risks must also be explored.</p> <p>Among them, the team warn that sperm could be transferred from a donor to a recipient, if they had recently had sex.</p> <p>While donors in the current study abstained from sex for a week and recipients were advised on contraception, the team say it might be necessary to make contraception a mandatory requirement for recipients. They also suggest the development of a vaginal fluid bank, allowing samples to repeatedly be screened.</p> <p>Elinav said the team is also exploring whether severe BV can be treated by administering a cocktail of \u201cgood\u201d microbes alone \u2013 an approach that might be simpler, cheaper and more reproducible than transplanting vaginal fluids.</p> <p>Phil Bennett, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Imperial College London who was not involved in the study, said it was now important to explore how best to match donors and recipients, understand links between vaginal microbiome and ethnicity, and determine which patients will benefit from the procedure.</p> <p>The new study is the latest to explore the potential of transplanting microbes from one human to another. Faecal transplantsbetween humans have proved successful in treating infections of the superbug <em>Clostridium difficile,</em> while efforts are afoot to explore whether they could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/23/bowel-cancer-trial-aims-to-reset-gut-bacteria\">used as a treatment for bowel cancer</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Transplanting vaginal fluids from one woman to another could help tackle severe cases of a common bacterial condition, a study has suggested. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is thought to affect up to a third of women of reproductive age. It is caused when the balance of microbes in the vagina \u2013 known as the vaginal microbiome \u2013 becomes disturbed, with a drop in lactobacilli while other bacteria take over. The condition is not generally serious, but it can increase the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, and of complications for pregnant women. It can also affect self-esteem; some women develop symptoms such as fishy-smelling discharge. While BV can often be treated with antibiotics, in some women it recurs just weeks or months later meaning a steady dose of antibiotics might be necessary. Now a small study has suggested severe BV could be treated by transplanting vaginal fluids from women containing a \u201chealthy\u201d collection of microbes. Prof Eran Elinav, co-author of the study from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, said the procedure could help address a large unmet need. \u201cBy introducing this new treatment approach, we hope that we may come a step closer to providing an affordable solution for the very many millions of women across the world that suffer with this disorder,\u201d he said. Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, Elinav and colleagues report how they carried out the procedure on five women aged between 27 and 47, all of whom had recurring BV and took regular antibiotics for the condition \u2013 drugs they stopped taking during the study. A week before the procedure, each woman was given antibiotic creams to at least partially clear existing bacteria in the vagina. The team then collected vaginal fluids from three donor women and transferred a sample to each recipient . All participants had been carefully screened for infections. The recipients were then examined in a series of subsequent appointments to see if their condition improved and whether BV recurred. If it did, the women were given a further transplant. The results reveal four of the recipients showed long-term improvements, with two requiring just one transplant and the others having three transplants each. After their last transplant, none of the four had a recurrence of BV for the remainder of the study \u2013 a period of between five months and 21 months depending on the recipient. Further analysis showed a dramatic and sustained change in the recipients\u2019 vaginal microbiome after successful transplant, with it becoming very similar to that of their donor\u2019s vaginal fluids and rich in lactobacilli. None of the women suffered any adverse effects. \u201cWith this friendly microbiome takeover, symptoms and complications associated with BV rapidly subside,\u201d said Elinav. The remaining recipient showed partial improvement after two transplants.. The team say the approach now needs to be explored in much larger clinical trials and compared with a placebo, while potential long-term consequences and risks must also be explored. Among them, the team warn that sperm could be transferred from a donor to a recipient, if they had recently had sex. While donors in the current study abstained from sex for a week and recipients were advised on contraception, the team say it might be necessary to make contraception a mandatory requirement for recipients. They also suggest the development of a vaginal fluid bank, allowing samples to repeatedly be screened. Elinav said the team is also exploring whether severe BV can be treated by administering a cocktail of \u201cgood\u201d microbes alone \u2013 an approach that might be simpler, cheaper and more reproducible than transplanting vaginal fluids. Phil Bennett, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Imperial College London who was not involved in the study, said it was now important to explore how best to match donors and recipients, understand links between vaginal microbiome and ethnicity, and determine which patients will benefit from the procedure. The new study is the latest to explore the potential of transplanting microbes from one human to another. Faecal transplantsbetween humans have proved successful in treating infections of the superbug Clostridium difficile, while efforts are afoot to explore whether they could be used as a treatment for bowel cancer.",

The pizza chain is reportedly in early talks to refinance two tranches of borrowing worth a combined \u00a3665m, part of a debt pile that had reached \u00a31.1bn by the end of December 2018. Pizza Express, which has not been immune to the deepening malaise in the casual dining sector, paid out \u00a393m in interest payments in 2018, a year in which it reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a355m loss, on sales of \u00a3543m. About half of the interest payments are made to its Chinese parent company, Hony Capital. Founded in 1965, Pizza Express has 470 outlets in the UK, with a further 150 internationally and employs 14,000 people. According to Bloomberg, the group has hired advisers ahead of talks with creditors who hold \u00a3465m of debt due for repayment in 2021 and \u00a3200m due the following year. Bondholders have also reportedly hired advisers to assist them in the discussions. Both sets of bonds are trading at below the value at which they were issued, indicating doubts in the market that those who have lent to the company will get all of their money back. The company\u2019s performance has also deteriorated in line with the broader casual dining sector.

The chain opened only two new branches over the period and said the focus would be on improving existing sites and revamping its menu. A spokesperson for Pizza Express declined to comment on debt talks. But as reports of the discussions emerged, speculation mounted that the company could go the way of restaurant chains such as Jamie\u2019s Italian, founded by the TV chef Jamie Oliver, which folded earlier this year. A source familiar with Pizza Express\u2019s finances said it was not in danger of collapse and was also unlikely to pursue a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) like those agreed by rival Italian chains such as Prezzo and Carluccio\u2019s. The controversial form of financial restructuring typically involves store closures, job cuts and landlords having to agree to lower rents.

      "body": "<p>In becoming only the second Englishman in two decades to be appointed as the national head coach, Chris Silverwood represents less of a risk than the man to precede him, Peter Moores.</p> <p>Moores, who was \u2013 bizarrely \u2013 given the post twice in 2007 and 2014, was first handed the job with undue haste after the departure of Duncan Fletcher at the end of the World Cup in the Caribbean; seven years later he was chosen to replace Andy Flower.</p> <p>The first time around he got the job on the back of his achievements in county cricket, where he oversaw Sussex winning the championship for the first time, and his work at the national academy. In 2014 he was the \u201coutstanding candidate\u201d according to the new cricket director, Paul Downton, but a disastrous World Cup campaign in Australasia led to his dismissal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/07/chris-silverwood-confirmed-as-england-new-head-coach-cricket\">Chris Silverwood confirmed as England\u2019s new head coach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Silverwood has also experienced success at county level, with Essex. But where he differs from Moores is in his experience of working with the current England team before being offered the top job \u2013 he has been England\u2019s bowling coach since 2018. The captain, Joe Root, knows what to expect; so do his fellow coaches and so does Ashley Giles, Downton\u2019s latest successor. This knowledge is far more important than being wooed by an impressive interviewee.</p> <p>Even so it is something of a surprise that Silverwood has got the job so rapidly. Last week the news that Gary Kirsten, a former coach of both India and South Africa, was meeting Giles, hinted that England would be opting for another experienced coach from overseas.

      "bodyText": "In becoming only the second Englishman in two decades to be appointed as the national head coach, Chris Silverwood represents less of a risk than the man to precede him, Peter Moores. Moores, who was \u2013 bizarrely \u2013 given the post twice in 2007 and 2014, was first handed the job with undue haste after the departure of Duncan Fletcher at the end of the World Cup in the Caribbean; seven years later he was chosen to replace Andy Flower. The first time around he got the job on the back of his achievements in county cricket, where he oversaw Sussex winning the championship for the first time, and his work at the national academy. In 2014 he was the \u201coutstanding candidate\u201d according to the new cricket director, Paul Downton, but a disastrous World Cup campaign in Australasia led to his dismissal. Silverwood has also experienced success at county level, with Essex. But where he differs from Moores is in his experience of working with the current England team before being offered the top job \u2013 he has been England\u2019s bowling coach since 2018. The captain, Joe Root, knows what to expect; so do his fellow coaches and so does Ashley Giles, Downton\u2019s latest successor. This knowledge is far more important than being wooed by an impressive interviewee. Even so it is something of a surprise that Silverwood has got the job so rapidly. Last week the news that Gary Kirsten, a former coach of both India and South Africa, was meeting Giles, hinted that England would be opting for another experienced coach from overseas. Kirsten\u2019s CV overpowers that of Silverwood. However, the South African may well have expressed understandable misgivings about the unrelenting demands of the England job. He has already spent a large chunk of his life on the road, staring at yet another hotel ceiling. Coaching Welsh Fire in the Hundred may not be quite such an exciting job for Kirsten \u2013 whatever the England and Wales Cricket Board handouts say \u2013 as overseeing an international side, but it is a far more comfortable and lucrative one when measured by hours spent in the nets or the dressing room. The sad truth is that the most exalted coaches in the world are not that interested in overseeing national sides once the franchises come calling.

When a celebrated painter of abstract canvases, Beiv (Jane Brennan), moves to her late husband\u2019s cottage on a West Cork island, she immediately knocks down the outer walls and replaces them with glass. To her son Colm (Marty Rea), who is visiting from the US with his new wife, this seems to be a statement to the local community that she has nothing to hide \u2013 which he suspects is not true. Whether Beiv owes him an explanation for anything in her life or her art is a problem that hangs over them.</p> <p>Colm\u2019s return to the island where he spent teenage summers reunites him with his old friend and former lover, Donal (Ian-Lloyd Anderson). Using elements of a murder mystery, Harris probes into secrets and lies, making acute observations about complex relationships. Delving into the past doesn\u2019t always help to change the present, as one painful, compelling scene between Donal and Colm shows: some things just can not be made right, especially unrequited love. Tightly wound by director Garry Hynes and superbly performed this play\u2019s strength is its insight into motivation and self-reflection, with designer <a href=\"http://stageandscreendesignireland.ie/designers/francis-oconnor/\">Francis O\u2019Connor</a>\u2019s limpid seascape adding Bergmanesque intensity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c3e42e0accdaba8afe0cd337b03a17163089c59b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3e42e0accdaba8afe0cd337b03a17163089c59b/0_181_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Brennan and Rae Gray in The Beacon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teasingly clever ...

In Lynne Parker\u2019s strikingly stark production for <a href=\"https://www.roughmagic.ie/\">Rough Magic</a>, the audience sits in the round, watching the tension coiling from up close. Enslaved Hecuba (Aisl\u00edn McGuckin) is pushed from imperious control to desperation as her children are killed one by one. Her final moments with her daughter Polyxena (Zara Devlin), as she prepares to watch her be sacrificed by Agamemnon, are particularly moving.</p> <p>McGuckin and Doherty are riveting. What doesn\u2019t convince is that Hecuba would share Agamemnon\u2019s bed, especially since, in Carr\u2019s adaptation, she does not take violent revenge for her suffering. Instead, she is portrayed as the grieving victim, the moral and cultural superior of the \u201cbarbarian\u201d Greeks, which reduces the complexity of the relationship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e969e864fc12aff67c11b64d86693bc59b12721\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e969e864fc12aff67c11b64d86693bc59b12721/426_756_2664_1598/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aisl\u00edn McGuckin and Zara Devlin in Hecuba.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coiling tension ...

In a labyrinthine building on Parnell Square, their latest immersive show, <a href=\"https://dublintheatrefestival.ie/programme/event/faultline\">Faultline</a>, recreates Dublin\u2019s underground LGBT+ scene of the early 1980s with painstaking period detail. Through frenetic dance and minimal dialogue, the cast of five moves from a nightclub to a helpline call centre to a men\u2019s toilet, as small audience groups squeeze into the background. The shifting scenes recreate a period of violent threat to gay men, including intrusive police investigation and harassment, at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Ireland.</p> <p>Eloquently directed and choreographed by Louise Lowe and performed with total commitment, the cast\u2019s proximity is designed to challenge to the audience. As a gay rights campaigner (Matthew Malone) struggles to cope with the misery of one caller to the helpline, he asks the audience: \u201cWhat would you have said to him?\u201d More contained and specific than some of the company\u2019s previous work, this production is a powerful spur to empathy, and a reminder of just how recently the victories for social justice and sexual equality in Ireland have been won.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://dublintheatrefestival.ie/\">Dublin </a><a href=\"https://dublintheatrefestival.ie/\">theatre </a><a href=\"https://dublintheatrefestival.ie/\">festival</a> runs until 13 October.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Questions of interpretation drive Nancy Harris\u2019s teasingly clever new play, The Beacon, for Druid Theatre and Dublin\u2019s Gate theatre. When a celebrated painter of abstract canvases, Beiv (Jane Brennan), moves to her late husband\u2019s cottage on a West Cork island, she immediately knocks down the outer walls and replaces them with glass. To her son Colm (Marty Rea), who is visiting from the US with his new wife, this seems to be a statement to the local community that she has nothing to hide \u2013 which he suspects is not true. Whether Beiv owes him an explanation for anything in her life or her art is a problem that hangs over them. Colm\u2019s return to the island where he spent teenage summers reunites him with his old friend and former lover, Donal (Ian-Lloyd Anderson). Using elements of a murder mystery, Harris probes into secrets and lies, making acute observations about complex relationships. Delving into the past doesn\u2019t always help to change the present, as one painful, compelling scene between Donal and Colm shows: some things just can not be made right, especially unrequited love. Tightly wound by director Garry Hynes and superbly performed this play\u2019s strength is its insight into motivation and self-reflection, with designer Francis O\u2019Connor\u2019s limpid seascape adding Bergmanesque intensity. The Trojan war has long been emblematic of all wars, and in Marina Carr\u2019s version of Hecuba, the defeated Trojan queen makes her point clearly. \u201cThis is genocide,\u201d she protests to the victorious Greek leader, Agamemnon (Brian Doherty). In Lynne Parker\u2019s strikingly stark production for Rough Magic, the audience sits in the round, watching the tension coiling from up close. Enslaved Hecuba (Aisl\u00edn McGuckin) is pushed from imperious control to desperation as her children are killed one by one. Her final moments with her daughter Polyxena (Zara Devlin), as she prepares to watch her be sacrificed by Agamemnon, are particularly moving. McGuckin and Doherty are riveting. What doesn\u2019t convince is that Hecuba would share Agamemnon\u2019s bed, especially since, in Carr\u2019s adaptation, she does not take violent revenge for her suffering. Instead, she is portrayed as the grieving victim, the moral and cultural superior of the \u201cbarbarian\u201d Greeks, which reduces the complexity of the relationship. Uncovering hidden social and political histories in site-specific spaces is Anu Productions\u2019 specialism. In a labyrinthine building on Parnell Square, their latest immersive show, Faultline, recreates Dublin\u2019s underground LGBT+ scene of the early 1980s with painstaking period detail. Through frenetic dance and minimal dialogue, the cast of five moves from a nightclub to a helpline call centre to a men\u2019s toilet, as small audience groups squeeze into the background. The shifting scenes recreate a period of violent threat to gay men, including intrusive police investigation and harassment, at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Ireland. Eloquently directed and choreographed by Louise Lowe and performed with total commitment, the cast\u2019s proximity is designed to challenge to the audience. As a gay rights campaigner (Matthew Malone) struggles to cope with the misery of one caller to the helpline, he asks the audience: \u201cWhat would you have said to him?\u201d More contained and specific than some of the company\u2019s previous work, this production is a powerful spur to empathy, and a reminder of just how recently the victories for social justice and sexual equality in Ireland have been won. Dublin theatre festival runs until 13 October.",

Areas such as Notting Hill and St John\u2019s Wood are popular, particularly with Americans. \u201cDemand in both areas is driven by the quality of the schools and they have been particularly popular among US tenants,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe weakening pound means overseas tenants have been able to increase their budgets.\u201d The near-17% drop in the pound against the dollar since the Brexit vote in 2016 has benefited tenants with dollar-denominated wealth \u2013 a budget of \u00a35,000 a week has been boosted to more than \u00a36,000 by currency movements since the referendum, Knight Frank noted. Mayfair, another affluent neighbourhood, has also attracted more super-rich tenants, after more luxury apartment blocks such as 20 Grosvenor Square and Clarges Mayfair were built, the report said. An apartment in the recently completed Clarges Mayfair building has just come on the market and is renting for \u00a330,000 a month, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a marble bathroom in the master bedroom suite. The nine-storey Portland stone block overlooking Green Park houses 33 other apartments, a swimming pool, spa and cinema. Meanwhile, a semi-detached four-bedroom house at 14 Upper Phillimore Gardens in Kensington costs \u00a325,000 a week to rent, while a four-bed detached house at 80 Elm Park Road in Chelsea is let at \u00a310,000 a week. Overall, there is a shortage of luxury new-build properties, which has driven rents higher. The number of new super-prime lettings listings declined to 209 in the second quarter of this year compared with 284 a year ago, according to Knight Frank. \u201cThe shortage of supply, particularly for the most in-demand new-build developments, means there can be a premium for the rental values paid,\u201d Smith said. Brexit-related uncertainty has put the super-rich off buying at the top end of the market, according to a separate Knight Frank report. In the year to January, 109 properties above \u00a310m changed hands, down 19% from 134 in the previous 12 months.",

      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/sep/30/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos</a> from last week.</p> <p>To begin, let\u2019s go to the end of Anthony Trollope\u2019s The Prime Minister, the final book in the Palliser series, as reviewed by <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18433622\">capedoctor</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With a central theme of 19th century British political life and intrigue, the resonance with current political chaos is astonishing. Although there is no resemblance whatsoever between the eponymous prime minister and Mr Johnson, the smooth journey of landed gentry into political office, the transience and superficiality of political alliances and the jealous protection of self-interest and patronage seems not to have changed much in 150 years. Added to this are Trollope\u2019s eloquence as a writer, his power of understatement on crucial social and political issues and so many other reasons why I personally keep going back to the great Victorian novels.</p> </blockquote> <p>Two views on The Dutch House by Ann Patchett. <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18298856\">LLCoolJ</a> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a nutshell: it\u2019s not her best, but it was still supremely satisfying to read, and I find myself still thinking it about it a week after finishing, which doesn\u2019t always happen with any author.</p> <p>But even a less-than-perfect Patchett is better than lots of stuff, and I\u2019m very glad I read it.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101279736\">Cardellina </a>has also been enjoying it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I haven\u2019t read a Patchett novel before (although \u201cBel Canto\u201d has lingered on my informal \u201cto read\u201d list for a while), and I bought it purely on the strength of its ludicrously gorgeous cover (always a risky move - I\u2019ve been burned before). So far it has been the perfect book for being curled up under a blanket with a gross cold.</p> </blockquote> <p>Country by Michael Hughes has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3690773\">fingerlakeswanderer</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A retelling of the Iliad but set in 1996 Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Achill is a sniper with the IRA who chooses to sit out his cohort\u2019s raid on a local army base. He\u2019s furious because he has been personally betrayed over a relationship, and he refuses all entreaties to change his mind, especially those from his friend, Pat. Henry is a British soldier who first fought in the Falklands, and now he\u2019s been sent to Northern Ireland. Everything leads to the consequences of Pat\u2019s refusal to fight.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019m currently reading and enjoying (if that\u2019s the word) Julian Barnes\u2019s The Only Story,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10022450\">scarletnoir</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Barnes is on top form here, telling a tale where the protagonist is roughly the same age as himself, and starting when the young man (19) falls in love with Susan (48). Every word is chosen with care, and the writing is top class.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI am re-reading Alan Booth\u2019s Looking For The Lost in advance of a hiking trip to Japan starting next week,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17381240\">greenmill</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although I won\u2019t see the Japan that Booth travelled through or have the level of engagement with local people in remote rural areas that he did (he was a fluent Japanese speaker whereas I have got to the heady heights of evening college level 2), Booth\u2019s beautiful prose which is alternately elegiac and comedic, remains an inspiration for my coming travels. His early death robbed us of a gifted travel writer whose love for his subject is burned into every page.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10493280\">rgilyead </a>has found plenty to recommend The Testaments by Margaret Atwood:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Atwood\u2019s ideas about Gilead have obviously been maturing for many years, helped, as she acknowledges, by feedback from readers and the opportunity to work on the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. This book is so rich in subtle details. I felt that the TV series, by making her horrific vision visible, actually diminished the impact of the story. She has an incredible, almost offhand, way of suggesting the horrors that have taken place. This book explores how Gilead came to exist and the insidious way in which precious freedoms were lost. The testaments of the three principal characters interleave to build up the picture of the rise of the theocracy and the bravery of the women who fought it.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. To begin, let\u2019s go to the end of Anthony Trollope\u2019s The Prime Minister, the final book in the Palliser series, as reviewed by capedoctor: With a central theme of 19th century British political life and intrigue, the resonance with current political chaos is astonishing. Although there is no resemblance whatsoever between the eponymous prime minister and Mr Johnson, the smooth journey of landed gentry into political office, the transience and superficiality of political alliances and the jealous protection of self-interest and patronage seems not to have changed much in 150 years. Added to this are Trollope\u2019s eloquence as a writer, his power of understatement on crucial social and political issues and so many other reasons why I personally keep going back to the great Victorian novels. Two views on The Dutch House by Ann Patchett. LLCoolJ writes: In a nutshell: it\u2019s not her best, but it was still supremely satisfying to read, and I find myself still thinking it about it a week after finishing, which doesn\u2019t always happen with any author. But even a less-than-perfect Patchett is better than lots of stuff, and I\u2019m very glad I read it. And Cardellina has also been enjoying it: I haven\u2019t read a Patchett novel before (although \u201cBel Canto\u201d has lingered on my informal \u201cto read\u201d list for a while), and I bought it purely on the strength of its ludicrously gorgeous cover (always a risky move - I\u2019ve been burned before). So far it has been the perfect book for being curled up under a blanket with a gross cold. Country by Michael Hughes has impressed fingerlakeswanderer: A retelling of the Iliad but set in 1996 Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Achill is a sniper with the IRA who chooses to sit out his cohort\u2019s raid on a local army base. He\u2019s furious because he has been personally betrayed over a relationship, and he refuses all entreaties to change his mind, especially those from his friend, Pat. Henry is a British soldier who first fought in the Falklands, and now he\u2019s been sent to Northern Ireland. Everything leads to the consequences of Pat\u2019s refusal to fight. \u201cI\u2019m currently reading and enjoying (if that\u2019s the word) Julian Barnes\u2019s The Only Story,\u201d says scarletnoir: Barnes is on top form here, telling a tale where the protagonist is roughly the same age as himself, and starting when the young man (19) falls in love with Susan (48). Every word is chosen with care, and the writing is top class. \u201cI am re-reading Alan Booth\u2019s Looking For The Lost in advance of a hiking trip to Japan starting next week,\u201d says greenmill: Although I won\u2019t see the Japan that Booth travelled through or have the level of engagement with local people in remote rural areas that he did (he was a fluent Japanese speaker whereas I have got to the heady heights of evening college level 2), Booth\u2019s beautiful prose which is alternately elegiac and comedic, remains an inspiration for my coming travels. His early death robbed us of a gifted travel writer whose love for his subject is burned into every page. Finally, rgilyead has found plenty to recommend The Testaments by Margaret Atwood: Atwood\u2019s ideas about Gilead have obviously been maturing for many years, helped, as she acknowledges, by feedback from readers and the opportunity to work on the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. This book is so rich in subtle details. I felt that the TV series, by making her horrific vision visible, actually diminished the impact of the story. She has an incredible, almost offhand, way of suggesting the horrors that have taken place. This book explores how Gilead came to exist and the insidious way in which precious freedoms were lost. The testaments of the three principal characters interleave to build up the picture of the rise of the theocracy and the bravery of the women who fought it. I think the book is a stunning achievement. Margaret for the Nobel, I say! Sounds like a plan. (The Nobel winners will be announced on Thursday.) Interesting links about books and reading Jim Carrey has written a novel about the inner darkness of a Hollywood actor. This actor is fictional. This piece on the collected words of Auberon Waugh has an excellent headline. \u201cThe Cockroach is so toothless and wan that it may drive his readers away in long apocalyptic caravans.\u201d Something tells me the New York Times reviewer didn\u2019t enjoy Ian McEwan\u2019s latest. UN report on magical realism warns of increased incidences of women\u2019s tears flooding the entire world. (Hat tip to Swelter.) The books of Susan Sontag ranked. Good news! Nothing is real.

We campaigned for months on this issue and still believe that not only our children, but thousands of other children across the country are being failed by the current system.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlthough the ruling may not have found in our favour we will not stop campaigning for change. We are not asking for preferential treatment, we just want children to have the best education they deserve.\u201d</p> \n<p>The case was brought against the former chancellor Philip Hammond and the former education secretary Damian Hinds over what the families claimed was the government\u2019s ongoing failure to allocate sufficient resources to support specialist provision for children with Send.</p> \n<p>Lawyers brought the action on four grounds, which were all dismissed in the judgment. They claimed the government was in breach of equality duties under the Equality Act 2010 as well as its duty to promote the wellbeing of children under the Children and Younger Persons Act 2008.</p> \n<p>They further claimed the government\u2019s decisions were \u201cirrational\u201d and in breach of the European convention on human rights, because their budget decisions resulted in differential treatment for children with Send.</p> \n<p>Jenni Richards QC, for the families, told the hearing in June the former chancellor had acted unlawfully in setting the national budget in October 2018, as had Hinds with additional but \u201cmanifestly insufficient\u201d Send funding in December.</p> \n<p>She said Department for Education (DfE) statistics showed rising demand for Send funding, which had \u201cnot been matched by anything like a commensurate increase in funding\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"194c2312-9b8c-4964-8649-c2115a20d956\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is austerity?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Austerity is how governments across Europe \u2013 from the UK to Greece \u2013 tried to clear the overdrafts, or deficits, they racked up in the wake of the great financial crisis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did governments try to achieve this?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Their strategy was two-fold. First, cut spending on the public sector, on wages, for instance, or on social security. Second, raise revenue through higher taxes and selling state assets. Greece, for instance, has sold its airports in Corfu and Santorini, among others, to a German company.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was their reasoning?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Proponents made a variety of arguments for this strategy. It was said that governments had spent too much money, that everyone needed to tighten their belts. The UK\u2019s then-chancellor, George Osborne, claimed that the public sector was \"crowding out\" the private sector, taking resources and workers away from businesses. Particularly influential was a paper by two US-based economists, Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart, arguing that once a country\u2019s total public borrowing rose above 90% of its national income, or GDP, growth would slow sharply.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Did austerity get unanimous backing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics argued that austerity would stop economies recovering from the shock of the banking meltdown and would make teachers and nurses and people with disabilities pay for the excesses of bankers and chief executives. In his book Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea, political economist Mark Blyth showed that austerity had been tried before in the 20th&nbsp;century \u2013 everywhere from Weimar Germany to 1930s America \u2013 and failed, often with politically disastrous consequences.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Government lawyers, opposing the legal action, argued the increase in demand was recognised by ministers who had \u201cmade it clear\u201d that high needs would be a priority ahead of the 2019 spending review.</p> \n<p>Since the hearing the government has announced an additional \u00a3700m over the next year for pupils with the most complex needs as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/06/gavin-williamson-review-special-needs-education-england\">a review</a> to examine how the Send system is working.

      "bodyText": "Families who launched a landmark legal challenge to the government\u2019s funding of services for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) have lost their high court case. Three families, representing thousands of others across England, brought the action claiming that government budget decisions had left local authorities unable to fulfil their legal obligation to provide education to children with Send. A two-day hearing in June heard from lawyers representing the families that there was a substantial national shortfall in Send funding for children and young people, the consequences of which could \u201cblight their lives forever\u201d. In a judgment handed down on Monday, however, Mr Justice Lewis ruled there was \u201cno unlawful discrimination\u201d in the way the government made provision for Send funding and dismissed the families\u2019 claim for judicial review. The legal action was brought by three children, who acted through their mothers: Nico Heugh Simone, 16, from Robertsbridge, East Sussex, nine-year-old Dakota Riddell, of Birmingham, and 14-year-old Benedict McFinnigan, from Scarborough. Nico\u2019s mother, Lorraine Heugh, said afterwards: \u201cWe are understandably disappointed by the ruling. We campaigned for months on this issue and still believe that not only our children, but thousands of other children across the country are being failed by the current system. \u201cAlthough the ruling may not have found in our favour we will not stop campaigning for change. We are not asking for preferential treatment, we just want children to have the best education they deserve.\u201d The case was brought against the former chancellor Philip Hammond and the former education secretary Damian Hinds over what the families claimed was the government\u2019s ongoing failure to allocate sufficient resources to support specialist provision for children with Send. Lawyers brought the action on four grounds, which were all dismissed in the judgment. They claimed the government was in breach of equality duties under the Equality Act 2010 as well as its duty to promote the wellbeing of children under the Children and Younger Persons Act 2008. They further claimed the government\u2019s decisions were \u201cirrational\u201d and in breach of the European convention on human rights, because their budget decisions resulted in differential treatment for children with Send. Jenni Richards QC, for the families, told the hearing in June the former chancellor had acted unlawfully in setting the national budget in October 2018, as had Hinds with additional but \u201cmanifestly insufficient\u201d Send funding in December. She said Department for Education (DfE) statistics showed rising demand for Send funding, which had \u201cnot been matched by anything like a commensurate increase in funding\u201d. Government lawyers, opposing the legal action, argued the increase in demand was recognised by ministers who had \u201cmade it clear\u201d that high needs would be a priority ahead of the 2019 spending review. Since the hearing the government has announced an additional \u00a3700m over the next year for pupils with the most complex needs as well as a review to examine how the Send system is working. Campaigners say, however, there is still a \u00a31bn shortfall that the government needs to address. Anne-Marie Irwin, of Irwin Mitchell solicitors, who represented the families, said: \u201cThe decision to take this case to the high court was not taken lightly. We believe that it was the first time that the high court has granted permission for a legal challenge against a government budget decision. \u201cWe and the families are disappointed by today\u2019s decision but thank the court for hearing the case. How Send services are funded is still an incredibly important issue, affecting tens of thousands of families, and one that needs addressing.\u201d Responding to the ruling, Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cToday\u2019s verdict is a huge blow to the families and children involved in this case, and allows the government to once again shirk its responsibility for these young people by fobbing them off to severely underfunded local authorities, who do not have the financial capacity to provide the specialist care and provision these families need and deserve.\u201d A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cNo child should be held back from reaching their potential, which is why we recently announced major new high needs funding worth well over \u00a3700m in 2020-21 \u2013 an increase of more than 11% on the amount available this year, bringing the total spent on supporting those with the most complex needs to over \u00a37bn. \u201cWe have also launched a review of the system to see how it can make further improvements to make sure every child gets the education that is right for them.\u201d",

Voters returned the third left-leaning government in a year to the Nordic region as Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats claimed victory in parliamentary elections in June, while in Italy the Democratic party finds itself unexpectedly back in government after a strategic blunder by the leader of the far-right League, Matteo Salvini. European Socialists were quick to celebrate. \u201cPortuguese society again chooses stability, equality and social justice,\u201d said Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the Spanish prime minister. \u201cWith the victory of the Socialist party, they are betting on a project of the left, progressives and modernisers. Let\u2019s continue working together for a fairer Europe.\u201d Celebrations were tempered, however, by the election in a country long thought immune to the rise of Europe\u2019s far right of an MP from a new nationalist formation, Chega! or Enough! \u2013 the first time a far-right party has won a seat in Portugal\u2019s parliament since the end of the Salazar dictatorship in 1974. After finishing second in the 2015 election and cobbling together his geringon\u00e7a, Costa reversed unpopular austerity measures, including cuts to public sector wages and pensions, introduced by the previous PSD-led government while still managing to bring Portugal\u2019s budget deficit down to nearly zero. He has won praise at home and in Brussels for combining fiscal discipline with successful measures to stimulate the economy, which is growing faster than the EU average helped by rising exports and a booming tourism industry that attracted more tourists to Portugal last year than it has inhabitants. Polls had suggested Costa might win an absolute majority, allowing the Socialists to govern alone, but his lead was eroded by a series of scandals, including the former Socialist defence minister, Jos\u00e9 Azeredo Lopes, being charged with abuse of power and denial of justice over his role in the alleged cover-up of a 2017 arms theft.",

      "bodyText": "The White House has given the green light to a Turkish offensive into northern Syria, moving US forces out of the area in an abrupt foreign policy change that will in effect abandon the Kurds, Washington\u2019s longtime military partner. Kurdish forces have spearheaded the campaign against Islamic State in the region, but the policy swerve, after a phone conversation between Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Sunday, means Turkey would take custody of captured Isis fighters, the White House said. It has also raised fears of fresh fighting between Turkey and Kurdish forces in Syria\u2019s complex war now the US no longer acts as a buffer between the two sides. Trump defended his decision, saying the Kurds were \u201cpaid massive amounts of money and equipment\u201d to fight and that he was leaving the fight against Isis to others for the time being. \u201cWe are 7,000 miles away,\u201d he tweeted, while vowing to crush the extremist movement \u201cif they come anywhere near us\u201d. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Monday its US partners had already begun withdrawing troops from areas along Turkey\u2019s border. Footage aired on Kurdish news agency Hawar purportedly showed US armoured vehicles evacuating key positions near the towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad in the border region. Erdo\u011fan also confirmed the development in remarks to reporters in Ankara. The SDF spokesman, Mustafa Bali, accused the US of leaving the area to \u201cturn into a war zone\u201d, adding that the SDF would \u201cdefend north-east Syria at all costs\u201d. A statement from the Turkish foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, said Ankara had \u201csupported the territorial integrity of Syria since the beginning of the crisis and will continue to do so \u2026 [We are] determined to ensure survivability and security of Turkey by clearing the region from terrorists.\u201d The decision represents the latest in a series of erratic moves by Trump, who is fighting impeachment at home, apparently taken without consultation with, or knowledge of, US diplomats dealing with Syria, or the UK and France, the US\u2019s main international partners in the country. Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump loyalist on most issues, told Fox News the move represented \u201ca big win for Iran and Assad [and] a big win for Isis\u201d. He vowed that Congress would pass a resolution reversing the decision. \u201cIsis is not defeated. This is the biggest lie being told by this administration,\u201d Graham said. Brett McGurk, a former US special envoy for the fight against Isis, said the White House statement demonstrated \u201ca complete lack of understanding of anything happening on the ground\u201d. McGurk pointed out that the US was not holding any Isis detainees. They are being held by the SDF, \u201cwhich Trump just served up to Turkey\u201d. \u201cTurkey has neither the intent, desire, nor capacity to manage 60,000 detainees, which State and [Pentagon inspectors general] warn is the nucleus for a resurgent Isis. Believing otherwise is a reckless gamble with our national security,\u201d McGurk said on Twitter. The US and Turkey came to an agreement in August to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northern Syria, by which the US-backed Kurdish-led SDF would pull back from the border. The safe zone deal was due to forestall a Turkish military offensive that has been threatened since Trump announced last December the 2,000 US special forces stationed in Syria would leave. Ankara sees the SDF as indistinguishable from Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey and views it as a serious security threat. In the White House statement issued just before 11pm on Sunday, however, that agreement was not mentioned. \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe United States armed forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the Isis territorial \u2018caliphate\u2019, will no longer be in the immediate area.\u201d The statement suggested that in return for US acquiescence in a Turkish offensive, Erdo\u011fan had assured Trump that Turkey would take over the detention of Isis militants captured by the SDF, on the battlefield. The custody of Europeans and other foreign fighters has long been one of Trump\u2019s preoccupations, and he has lambasted European governments for not taking responsibility for their own nationals in Isis\u2019 ranks. Syria experts have warned that the US abandonment of the SDF would lead to another new front in the eight-year Syrian conflict, and could push the Kurds into seeking an arrangement with the Assad regime in Damascus. The Kurdish leadership has long been in talks with Damascus to ensure a level of Kurdish autonomy in north eastern Syria in the event of a US pullout.

      "body": "<p>If there was ever a doubt that a racing driver\u2019s first priority is to beat his teammate, it was dispelled one March afternoon at Melbourne\u2019s Albert Park. The 1996 Australian Grand Prix was half done when Jacques Villeneuve came out of the pits just behind the race leader, Damon Hill.</p> <p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d said the voice on Villeneuve\u2019s radio. \u201cGo and get him!\u201d</p> <p>It was the first race of the season, and two sons of great drivers had been paired in the Williams team, whose cars were reckoned to be a shoo-in for the championship. Hill had missed chances to win the title in the two previous years and the abrasive Canadian newcomer was widely expected to outshine him. In this, his first grand prix, Villeneuve had started from pole position and led the first half of the race. The message from the pit wall left no doubt of the intention to beat Hill and lay down a marker for the rest of the season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/03/charles-leclerc-ferrari-russian-grand-prix-sochi-knocks-learning\">The knocks keep coming at Ferrari but Charles Leclerc is learning fast | Giles Richards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not quite how it turned out. Villeneuve took only a handful of corners to overtake his teammate, putting himself in position to become only the second man in history to win on his grand prix debut. But a leak from his engine was soon covering the other Williams with oil, and he was told to slow down and let Hill past. It took him several laps to comply, allowing Hill to take the first of the eight victories that would give him the title.</p> <p>The initial radio instruction to attack Hill had come from Jock Clear, the Canadian\u2019s young race engineer, whose aggressive approach was a match for Villeneuve\u2019s own. Their championship victory would come the following season, after Hill had left the team.</p> <p>Twenty-three years on, Clear is now the race engineer of Charles Leclerc, the young star of the Ferrari team, whose brilliant wins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/01/charles-leclerc-first-grand-prix-win-belgium\" title=\"\">from pole position at Spa</a> and Monza last month reversed the tide of the first half of the season, in which the Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas had won 10 of the 12 races. Suddenly Formula One had a 21-year-old who appeared to be giving the sport\u2019s most famous team a realistic hope of their first world title in a dozen years \u2013 if not this season, then certainly in 2020. Full of talent, charm, and promise, Leclerc looked capable of succeeding where Fernando Alonso, who joined the Scuderia in 2010 after winning two world championships with Renault, and Sebastian Vettel, previously a four-times champion with Red Bull, had failed.</p> <p>Leclerc was on pole for the next race, too, in Singapore, and was leading when a strategy call and a couple of safety-car periods handed Vettel an unexpected victory ahead of the other Ferrari, taken with an alacrity that stifled the team\u2019s thoughts of ordering a reversal of the finishing order. \u201cFloodlight robbery!\u201d was the headline on the cover of that week\u2019s Autosport magazine.</p> <p>In Sochi a week later the internecine warfare intensified when Ferrari\u2019s management again out-thought themselves, this time with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/29/lewis-hamilton-wins-russian-grand-prix-formula-one-f1\" title=\"\">more comprehensively disastrous outcome</a>. With Leclerc again on pole, alongside Hamilton and ahead of Vettel, the team cooked up a scheme for Vettel to slipstream Leclerc off the line, using the extra speed to hold off any challenge from the Mercedes. In the event Vettel took advantage of the tow to grab the lead at the first corner, resisting radio entreaties to let Leclerc regain the position with the claim that he had earned the right to maintain his lead by being faster on the track.

      "bodyText": "If there was ever a doubt that a racing driver\u2019s first priority is to beat his teammate, it was dispelled one March afternoon at Melbourne\u2019s Albert Park. The 1996 Australian Grand Prix was half done when Jacques Villeneuve came out of the pits just behind the race leader, Damon Hill. \u201cThere he is,\u201d said the voice on Villeneuve\u2019s radio. \u201cGo and get him!\u201d It was the first race of the season, and two sons of great drivers had been paired in the Williams team, whose cars were reckoned to be a shoo-in for the championship. Hill had missed chances to win the title in the two previous years and the abrasive Canadian newcomer was widely expected to outshine him. In this, his first grand prix, Villeneuve had started from pole position and led the first half of the race. The message from the pit wall left no doubt of the intention to beat Hill and lay down a marker for the rest of the season. That\u2019s not quite how it turned out. Villeneuve took only a handful of corners to overtake his teammate, putting himself in position to become only the second man in history to win on his grand prix debut. But a leak from his engine was soon covering the other Williams with oil, and he was told to slow down and let Hill past. It took him several laps to comply, allowing Hill to take the first of the eight victories that would give him the title. The initial radio instruction to attack Hill had come from Jock Clear, the Canadian\u2019s young race engineer, whose aggressive approach was a match for Villeneuve\u2019s own. Their championship victory would come the following season, after Hill had left the team. Twenty-three years on, Clear is now the race engineer of Charles Leclerc, the young star of the Ferrari team, whose brilliant wins from pole position at Spa and Monza last month reversed the tide of the first half of the season, in which the Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas had won 10 of the 12 races. Suddenly Formula One had a 21-year-old who appeared to be giving the sport\u2019s most famous team a realistic hope of their first world title in a dozen years \u2013 if not this season, then certainly in 2020. Full of talent, charm, and promise, Leclerc looked capable of succeeding where Fernando Alonso, who joined the Scuderia in 2010 after winning two world championships with Renault, and Sebastian Vettel, previously a four-times champion with Red Bull, had failed. Leclerc was on pole for the next race, too, in Singapore, and was leading when a strategy call and a couple of safety-car periods handed Vettel an unexpected victory ahead of the other Ferrari, taken with an alacrity that stifled the team\u2019s thoughts of ordering a reversal of the finishing order. \u201cFloodlight robbery!\u201d was the headline on the cover of that week\u2019s Autosport magazine. In Sochi a week later the internecine warfare intensified when Ferrari\u2019s management again out-thought themselves, this time with a more comprehensively disastrous outcome. With Leclerc again on pole, alongside Hamilton and ahead of Vettel, the team cooked up a scheme for Vettel to slipstream Leclerc off the line, using the extra speed to hold off any challenge from the Mercedes. In the event Vettel took advantage of the tow to grab the lead at the first corner, resisting radio entreaties to let Leclerc regain the position with the claim that he had earned the right to maintain his lead by being faster on the track. The argument ended when further confusion in Ferrari\u2019s pit\u2011stop strategy preceded Vettel\u2019s retirement with power-unit failure, a disappointing third place for Leclerc behind the two Mercedes, and a post-race atmosphere of mutual distrust. Bad feeling between teammates is an occasional feature of grand prix racing going back to the late 1930s, when the two senior drivers of the dominant Mercedes team, Rudolf Caracciola and Manfred von Brauchitsch, tried using sulks, tantrums and internal machinations to thwart the challenge from their younger and faster teammates, the former mechanic Hermann Lang and the British ace Richard Seaman. More recently, outright dislike between Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet at Williams in 1986 enabled Alain Prost to squeeze his McLaren between the two favourites and snatch the title. By contrast, the lurid incidents provoked by Prost\u2019s bitter rivalry with Ayrton Senna at McLaren in 1988 and 1989 helped to raise the sport\u2019s profile. In the present decade, Vettel\u2019s falling-out with Mark Webber at Red Bull and Hamilton\u2019s altercations with Nico Rosberg and Bottas at Mercedes have provided headlines that should have been generated by actual racing. Vettel\u2019s refusal to yield the lead to the younger man in Sochi seems to have its origin in an incident last month at Monza, an ultra-fast track where teammates are expected to assist each other during qualifying by providing an aerodynamic tow. During a chaotic final session Leclerc was unable to put himself in a position to give Vettel the expected assistance to set a fast time. Or perhaps he was unwilling. Such things are not forgotten and tend to fester. Just as George Bernard Shaw is supposed to have said that the English and the Americans are two nations divided by a common language, so Leclerc and Vettel are two racing drivers divided by a common machine: the Ferrari SF90, now the fastest in the field. With the 2019 drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 titles virtually settled in favour of Hamilton and Mercedes, many eyes at Suzuka this weekend will be on the struggle for supremacy in the Scuderia\u2019s garage, with all its implications for campaigns to come.",

Scorsese provoked uproar by telling Empire magazine he had tried and failed to get interested in Marvel films, and said they were \u201cnot cinema\u201d. Jackson\u2019s response came as he was speaking to Variety at the much-hyped launch of Tyler Perry\u2019s studio facility in Atlanta, Georgia. Jackson, who has appeared as SHIELD head Nick Fury in 10 Marvel films, including The Avengers series, the Iron Man and the Captain America films, said \u201cthat\u2019s kind of like saying Bugs Bunny ain\u2019t funny\u201d. \u201cFilms are films. You know, everybody doesn\u2019t like his stuff either. I mean, we happen to, but everybody doesn\u2019t. \u201cThere are a lot of Italian-Americans that don\u2019t think he should be making films about them like that.

The first article to describe these risks was published in 1979; further research since has detailed the occupational risks of working with these drugs, and the health conditions that can ensue. The introduction of closed-system drug transfer devices (CSTD) has, however, made chemotherapy much safer for those who administer it. The CSTDs prevent any drug, vapour, or aerosols escaping because there is no more spiking and unspiking. As the drugs are administered within a closed device (which lets nothing in or out), it is mechanically impossible for vapour to escape. Clare Norris is ward manager at Castle Hill hospital, Hull University teaching trust. She has been instrumental in driving forward the use of closed systems within oncology at her hospital. \u201cPrior to implementing the closed system, we were at risk of exposure to chemotherapy. We mitigated this by using best practice,\u201d she says. \u201c[Implementation] started in the day unit \u2013 in a busy week, there could be 80-90 patients a day,\u201d she says. This was a change in practice but trainers from BD were there to help. Subsequently, two inpatient wards started to use closed systems, too. A nurse\u2019s mindset is focused on helping others. However, nobody wants to go to work thinking they may be at risk. \u201cNurses are a scarce resource for hospitals so they have more power than they might think,\u201d says Rogers. \u201cI know of one nurse who took a job in an oncology unit which implemented closed systems, because she was allergic to the medications being administered. Using closed systems protects her, and others, from exposure and gives them confidence that their employer is taking their occupational health and safety seriously.\u201d",

Her husband, Paul Kenward, is the company\u2019s managing director. Atkins was accused of \u201chypocrisy on a grand scale\u201d after speaking out against the class B drug. \u201cGiven how compromised his predecessor was, we welcome the new minister\u2019s appointment,\u201d said Martin Powell from the Transform Drug Policy Foundation. \u201cWe remain concerned at the lack of engagement from the Home Office with the drugs sector, but this move presents a genuine opportunity for the department to operate an evidence-based approach that will protect some of the most vulnerable people in our society. \u201cThousands of lives are being lost needlessly every year because of the continued criminalisation of people who use drugs, when a health-led approach is required.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>They are one of the most crucial parts of modern healthcare, allowing us to treat infections that might otherwise be deadly and making life-saving surgery and treatments such as organ transplants and chemotherapy possible. But the effectiveness of antibiotics is so threatened by the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that Dame Sally Davies, England\u2019s chief medical officer, has warned that without action now, even <a href=\"http://bsac.org.uk/antimicrobial-resistance-poses-catastrophic-threat-says-chief-medical-officer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">minor surgery</a> could lead to routine deaths within the next 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Health Organization</a> (WHO), AMR is one of the top challenges to continued way of life on Earth, alongside climate change,\u201d says Greg Quinn, director of public policy and advocacy at healthcare company BD. And although the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics was predictable \u2013 it was foreseen by Alexander Fleming in his Nobel prize acceptance speech back in the 1940s \u2013 today it\u2019s a far more worrying prospect for two reasons, says Dr Nicholas Brown, a consultant microbiologist at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge and director of the public and professional engagement for the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC), one of the UK\u2019s leading antibiotics charities.</p> <p>\u201cWhereas in the past, when resistance developed, we could simply turn to an alternative antibiotic, now we don\u2019t have the ready supply of new agents to take over,\u201d Brown says. \u201cAt the same time, the rate of emergence of resistance appears to be accelerating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e24d29e8e6a210d438e5cefff290786b17b2a51e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e24d29e8e6a210d438e5cefff290786b17b2a51e/0_135_7787_4674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pharmacist holding medicine box and capsule pack in pharmacy drugstore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broad-spectrum antibiotics are routinely given to patients with infection-related problems in A&amp;E.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MJ_Prototype/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s encouraging, says Quinn, to see consensus and coalitions at country, regional and global levels \u2013 including the UK\u2019s own 20-year vision and five-year <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/antimicrobial-resistance-uk-launches-5-year-action-plan-and-20-year-vision\" rel=\"nofollow\">national action plan</a> for how the UK will help contain and control AMR \u2013 but it\u2019s now time for action. \u201cNobody argues with the strategy, but everybody has a part to play to mobilise much smarter implementation,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For him, the role of rapid diagnostics and point-of-care diagnostics is key \u2013 and underdeveloped. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are routinely given to patients coming to emergency departments with infection-related problems from chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes complications, he explains, and it can take two or three days to get a more targeted drug. But it\u2019s the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics that\u2019s one of the major causes of AMR, and meanwhile the patient is taking a drug that may not be effective.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"28903ccabbf86237595879f16f4af24e29c9a729\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28903ccabbf86237595879f16f4af24e29c9a729/0_473_3425_4282/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pills in a pill box.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antibiotics are currently one of the most crucial parts of modern healthcare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cristina Pedrazzini/Getty Images/Science Photo Library RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPoint-of-care and rapid diagnostics enable you to drastically reduce not only the timeline but also the broad-spectrum treatment, which is such a big driver of AMR,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cDiagnostics are critical to ensure that the right treatment is used at the right time.\u201d</p> <p>The integrated approach taken by BD Life Sciences is essential, says Dr Tracy Ellison, director of medical affairs for Europe at the company\u2019s pre-analytical systems division. \u201cIf someone shows up at a hospital emergency department with an infection, think about the journey they go on: it has many, many touchpoints,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re poorly, you\u2019re going to have some blood taken.

      "bodyText": "They are one of the most crucial parts of modern healthcare, allowing us to treat infections that might otherwise be deadly and making life-saving surgery and treatments such as organ transplants and chemotherapy possible. But the effectiveness of antibiotics is so threatened by the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that Dame Sally Davies, England\u2019s chief medical officer, has warned that without action now, even minor surgery could lead to routine deaths within the next 20 years. \u201cAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), AMR is one of the top challenges to continued way of life on Earth, alongside climate change,\u201d says Greg Quinn, director of public policy and advocacy at healthcare company BD. And although the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics was predictable \u2013 it was foreseen by Alexander Fleming in his Nobel prize acceptance speech back in the 1940s \u2013 today it\u2019s a far more worrying prospect for two reasons, says Dr Nicholas Brown, a consultant microbiologist at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge and director of the public and professional engagement for the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC), one of the UK\u2019s leading antibiotics charities. \u201cWhereas in the past, when resistance developed, we could simply turn to an alternative antibiotic, now we don\u2019t have the ready supply of new agents to take over,\u201d Brown says. \u201cAt the same time, the rate of emergence of resistance appears to be accelerating.\u201d It\u2019s encouraging, says Quinn, to see consensus and coalitions at country, regional and global levels \u2013 including the UK\u2019s own 20-year vision and five-year national action plan for how the UK will help contain and control AMR \u2013 but it\u2019s now time for action. \u201cNobody argues with the strategy, but everybody has a part to play to mobilise much smarter implementation,\u201d he says. For him, the role of rapid diagnostics and point-of-care diagnostics is key \u2013 and underdeveloped. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are routinely given to patients coming to emergency departments with infection-related problems from chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes complications, he explains, and it can take two or three days to get a more targeted drug. But it\u2019s the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics that\u2019s one of the major causes of AMR, and meanwhile the patient is taking a drug that may not be effective. \u201cPoint-of-care and rapid diagnostics enable you to drastically reduce not only the timeline but also the broad-spectrum treatment, which is such a big driver of AMR,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cDiagnostics are critical to ensure that the right treatment is used at the right time.\u201d The integrated approach taken by BD Life Sciences is essential, says Dr Tracy Ellison, director of medical affairs for Europe at the company\u2019s pre-analytical systems division. \u201cIf someone shows up at a hospital emergency department with an infection, think about the journey they go on: it has many, many touchpoints,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re poorly, you\u2019re going to have some blood taken. You need to make sure that your arm\u2019s cleaned properly before they stick a needle in, because you can get false positives from the bacteria on your skin. \u201cYou could also have false negatives if you don\u2019t have enough blood in the bottle. The pre-analytical elements associated with how we collect samples are so important. Then there\u2019s the transport, which needs to be done swiftly, keeping samples at the right temperature, and testing at a laboratory with an efficient processing environment \u2013 all with the aim of getting an actionable result, and getting the patient the right antibiotics as quickly as possible.\u201d But while diagnostics are important, so is the stewardship of existing antibiotics. Last year a government-funded study found that GPs were wrongly giving antibiotics to one in five patients who had a cough or sore throat. However, in the past there have been improvements when goals have been set to reduce prescribing antibiotics. Quinn, however, thinks health professionals may be mistaken in assuming patients won\u2019t be satisfied unless they get antibiotics: \u201cA lot of research shows that what they actually want is an acknowledgement there is a problem and a plan to address it. It could be antibiotics, but it could also be a supportive: \u2018Buy an over-the-counter remedy, go to bed for two days, then go back to work.\u2019\u201d And it\u2019s not enough simply to protect existing antibiotics. \u201cThe other side is around the stimulation of the drug development market to encourage the discovery, development, licensing and marketing of new agents,\u201d says Brown. \u201cThis is really a multifaceted response.\u201d In face of the grave threat posed by AMR, partnerships between all stakeholders, including industry competitors, are vital, says Quinn. \u201cWith AMR the answer isn\u2019t with one person or group, so we strive to facilitate collaboration between people and organisations who can combine to drive the solution,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to our mission that we do everything we can.\u201d",

Betrayal has been an enduring theme whenever the US and the Kurds have partnered, but never before as nakedly as this.</p> <p>As US armour and troops started to leave the region on Monday, a frantic Kurdish leadership was demanding explanations and readying for an invasion that could change the map of the region and prove hugely consequential in other ways too, including undermining the security gains achieved in the war on Isis. </p> <p>Since the battlefield victory, Syrian Kurds have swapped roles from fighters to jailers, detaining 90,000 suspected Isis supporters in four camps across the province. Guards remained loyal to the cause on the promise of ongoing patronage from Washington. They have far less incentive to do so now.</p> <p>European states, deeply invested in what happens to the Isis camps, were blindsided by Trump\u2019s announcement that Turkey would take control of them and sceptical that Ankara has either the will or capacity to do such a thing.</p> <p>For its part, Ankara also appears to be surprised. The site of one camp, al-Hol, is not on maps it has prepared for its operation. Inheriting a headache on this scale seems to be part of a quid pro quo imposed on Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. A state dinner at the White House may well hinge on him agreeing.</p> <p>Among the camp detainees are hard-wired ideologues who would be central to an Isis resurgence if given the chance. The spectre of a jihadist juggernaut once again roaming the plains of Iraq and Syria after using captivity to regroup \u2013 think the US-run detention centres in Iraq writ large \u2013 now hangs heavy over a region still grappling with the seismic regional power shifts that have defined Trump\u2019s three turbulent years in office.</p> <p>The abandonment of the Kurds is perhaps the most impactful of all. The debt owed to Kurdish forces is acknowledged by western security partners who realise Isis remains unfinished business. Trump\u2019s US had found itself atop a world order it no longer wanted to lead and, more consequentially, no longer seemed to believe in. In the eyes of some bewildered regional allies, Iraq and Saudi Arabia in particular, the US has nothing left to offer but a chequebook. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s transactional worldview offers no place for history or morality. His ruthless short-term realism ignores the fact that the regional interests he does want to secure \u2013 containing Iran and securing Israel \u2013 are jeopardised by such a blatant betrayal.</p> <p>For all the US president\u2019s talk of taking on Iran, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/18/saudi-oil-attack-rouhani-dismisses-us-claims-of-iran-role-as-slander\">Iranian attack </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/18/saudi-oil-attack-rouhani-dismisses-us-claims-of-iran-role-as-slander\">on </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/18/saudi-oil-attack-rouhani-dismisses-us-claims-of-iran-role-as-slander\">Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil supply</a> last month received no response from the US and has instead sparked a detente between Riyadh and Tehran that will inevitably lead to new trade openings and puncture US efforts to crush Iran\u2019s economy.</p> <p>When Trump first flagged a withdrawal from north-east Syria last December, his advisers were able to turn him around, partly by explaining that it would give Iran unfettered access in the province and make a coveted pathway to the Mediterranean Sea an easier bet. That logic stands 10 months on and has been reaffirmed by Iran\u2019s activities near the Syrian border and in the Syrian port of Latakia.</p> <p>Serving US interests is hardly a Kurdish priority now. Instead, allying with the Syrian regime in Damascus to ward off the Turks seems to be one of the few ploys open to Kurdish leaders, who would struggle to combat a full-scale Turkish invasion.</p> <p>The prize for Turkey is significant: moving Kurds away from nearly the full length of the border and scaling back the gains made over the last six years by its arch-foe, the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which dominates administrative positions in the region.</p> <p>This would be a triumph for Erdo\u011fan, who throughout the war against Isis prioritised Ankara\u2019s enmity with the PKK over that with the jihadists \u2013 a stance that drew US distrust. In Turkey\u2019s eyes, the US had partnered with its worst enemy, claiming a false distinction between local Kurds and the PKK itself, forcing it to look elsewhere for friends.</p> <p>Whether Turkey has a new friend in Trump will remain an open question. Whether the Kurds can trust the US has already been answered. Vanquished yet again, the Kurds must be wondering what they need to do to secure any sort of loyalty.</p>",

European states, deeply invested in what happens to the Isis camps, were blindsided by Trump\u2019s announcement that Turkey would take control of them and sceptical that Ankara has either the will or capacity to do such a thing. For its part, Ankara also appears to be surprised. The site of one camp, al-Hol, is not on maps it has prepared for its operation. Inheriting a headache on this scale seems to be part of a quid pro quo imposed on Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. A state dinner at the White House may well hinge on him agreeing. Among the camp detainees are hard-wired ideologues who would be central to an Isis resurgence if given the chance. The spectre of a jihadist juggernaut once again roaming the plains of Iraq and Syria after using captivity to regroup \u2013 think the US-run detention centres in Iraq writ large \u2013 now hangs heavy over a region still grappling with the seismic regional power shifts that have defined Trump\u2019s three turbulent years in office. The abandonment of the Kurds is perhaps the most impactful of all. The debt owed to Kurdish forces is acknowledged by western security partners who realise Isis remains unfinished business. Trump\u2019s US had found itself atop a world order it no longer wanted to lead and, more consequentially, no longer seemed to believe in. In the eyes of some bewildered regional allies, Iraq and Saudi Arabia in particular, the US has nothing left to offer but a chequebook. Trump\u2019s transactional worldview offers no place for history or morality. His ruthless short-term realism ignores the fact that the regional interests he does want to secure \u2013 containing Iran and securing Israel \u2013 are jeopardised by such a blatant betrayal. For all the US president\u2019s talk of taking on Iran, the Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil supply last month received no response from the US and has instead sparked a detente between Riyadh and Tehran that will inevitably lead to new trade openings and puncture US efforts to crush Iran\u2019s economy. When Trump first flagged a withdrawal from north-east Syria last December, his advisers were able to turn him around, partly by explaining that it would give Iran unfettered access in the province and make a coveted pathway to the Mediterranean Sea an easier bet. That logic stands 10 months on and has been reaffirmed by Iran\u2019s activities near the Syrian border and in the Syrian port of Latakia. Serving US interests is hardly a Kurdish priority now. Instead, allying with the Syrian regime in Damascus to ward off the Turks seems to be one of the few ploys open to Kurdish leaders, who would struggle to combat a full-scale Turkish invasion. The prize for Turkey is significant: moving Kurds away from nearly the full length of the border and scaling back the gains made over the last six years by its arch-foe, the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which dominates administrative positions in the region. This would be a triumph for Erdo\u011fan, who throughout the war against Isis prioritised Ankara\u2019s enmity with the PKK over that with the jihadists \u2013 a stance that drew US distrust. In Turkey\u2019s eyes, the US had partnered with its worst enemy, claiming a false distinction between local Kurds and the PKK itself, forcing it to look elsewhere for friends. Whether Turkey has a new friend in Trump will remain an open question. Whether the Kurds can trust the US has already been answered. Vanquished yet again, the Kurds must be wondering what they need to do to secure any sort of loyalty.",

This could lead to victims not accessing existing qualified support. Two men were later convicted of the rape of a woman in their asylum seeker hostel in an unrelated attack. Councillors told the commission that, rather than draw attention to injustice, from the outset the protests whipped up anti-minority feeling. The protesters also intimidated those who opposed them. One Muslim resident had his personal details publicised as punishment for organising a counterprotest. Photographs of him at the march and his personal information appeared on social media alongside unfounded allegations that he was a \u201cpaedo\u201d and a \u201crape enabler\u201d. He received numerous threats and his business was boycotted. The report said: \u201cMany protesters were not motivated by hate; they had concerns about their safety and the safety of those in the community. \u201cHowever, far-right agitators exploited these local grievances. Members of the movement had links to banned group National Action. The shared belief of these figures and groups was their antipathy towards minorities, immigrants and particularly Muslims. Most of those involved share a pronounced prejudice against Muslims. \u201cWe were told that sections of the local white community which would not normally support the far right were \u2018stirred up by activists\u2019. \u201cBy co-opting people in this way and promoting their narrative, those activists aggravated social division.\u201d In her report, Khan said victims needed to be better protected, and those working to tackle extremism needed more support. She said the home secretary should lead a new taskforce, involving the government and public bodies, in an effort to address the problem. The review called on the government to focus on what the commission calls \u201chateful extremism\u201d, which stands apart from terrorism and violent extremism. Hateful extremism could be behaviour that could \u201cincite and amplify hate\u201d or make the \u201cmoral case for violence\u201d and could put people at risk of harm, the report said. Such behaviour might direct \u201chateful, hostile or supremacist beliefs\u201d to groups perceived to be a threat to \u201cwellbeing, survival or success\u201d. Last month in an interview with the Guardian, Khan called language used by Boris Johnson to describe Muslim women demeaning and dehumanising and warned that politicians and the media risked provoking violence through their rhetoric. She criticised the use of inflammatory phrases and terms such as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d and \u201csaboteurs\u201d \u2013 both of which featured in Daily Mail headlines \u2013 in political discourse. The debate over the use of inflammatory language in public erupted when the House of Commons returned after the unlawful prorogation of parliament and Johnson refused to acknowledge his words had consequences as he was confronted by MPs.",

He said the government had made a significant compromise in agreeing that Northern Ireland should remain aligned to EU rules for goods and agriculture \u2013 subject to agreement by Stormont \u2013 and called for the EU to make clear its objections to his plans. \u201cWhat we are saying to our friends is, this is a very generous, fair and reasonable offer that we have made. What we would like to hear from you now is what your thoughts are. And if you have issues with any of the proposals that we\u2019ve come up with, then let\u2019s get into the detail and discuss them,\u201d he said. After declining to meet with the prime minister in person, Macron insisted during a phone call on Sunday that the talks would only be advanced through Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator. \u201cBoris Johnson presented his latest proposals,\u201d an official at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said of the conversation. \u201cThe president told him that the negotiations should continue swiftly with Michel Barnier\u2019s team in coming days, in order to evaluate at the end of the week whether a deal is possible that respects European Union principles.\u201d Barnier has already said he does not have a mandate from the EU27 to agree a deal on the terms so far presented by Downing Street. The prime minister\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost, has also been repeatedly told there will no last-minute negotiations with leaders at the summit on 17 October. Before Johnson set out his Brexit proposals in his party conference speech, No 10 suggested that if the EU27 declined to engage, the government would press ahead towards a no-deal departure. \u201cThe government is either going to be negotiating a new deal or working on no deal \u2013 nobody will work on delay. We will keep fighting to respect the biggest democratic vote in British history,\u201d a senior official said at the time. Downing Street continues to insist that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, despite government lawyers having conceded last week in the Scottish courts that Johnson would have to comply with the Benn act. That legislation, drawn up by a cross-party group of backbenchers, obliges the government to write a letter to the EU27, requesting an extension to article 50 \u2013 and to accept that extension \u2013 if parliament has not agreed to a Brexit deal before 19 October. \u201cWe want to secure a deal, because it\u2019s in the best interests of the UK and the EU to work together to reach that agreement \u2013 but without one, we will be leaving on October 31,\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesman insisted. Asked how that could be the case, given the requirements set out in the Benn law, he added, \u201cthe manner in which this policy is lawfully achieved is a matter for the government\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Over the past 30 years Hungarian fiction has firmly established itself on the map of modern European literature, with writers such as P\u00e9ter N\u00e1das, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/07/31/pter-esterhzy-hungarian-novelist--obituary/\" title=\"\">P\u00e9ter Esterh\u00e1zy</a> and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai widely known across the world. However, the renaissance of fictional writing in Hungary had already begun in 1969 with Gy\u00f6rgy Konr\u00e1d\u2019s short debut novel, A L\u00e1togat\u00f3, which was translated into English in 1975 under the title The Case Worker. </p> <p>Konr\u00e1d, who has died aged 86, used the book to subtly critique Hungary\u2019s communist regime. But it was also an exceptional stylistic achievement, with sparse dialogue and long streams of consciousness. While the authorities disapproved of its themes \u2013 based around the life of a soul-searching social worker dealing with people with mental health problems \u2013 the Hungarian public responded much more positively, and the first pressing of A L\u00e1togat\u00f3 sold out in a few days.</p> <p>Later, in the mid-1970s, after being arrested and harassed because of his writing, Konr\u00e1d agreed a compromise with the government under which he went unpublished in Hungary, but was allowed to travel and publish abroad. After communism fell in the late 80s he received his full due as a writer, and was acknowledged as one of the groundbreakers for the likes of N\u00e1das, Esterh\u00e1zy and Krasznahorkai.</p> <p>Konr\u00e1d was born into a Jewish merchant family in Debrecen and grew up in Beretty\u00f3\u00fajfalu, close to the Romanian border; his father, J\u00f3zsef, and his mother, R\u00f3za (nee Klein), owned a hardware shop in the small town. In 1944, when the German army occupied Hungary, days before the ghettoisation and deportation of the Jewish population from the countryside began, Gy\u00f6rgy and his sister, \u00c9va, were sent to relatives in Budapest \u2013 a decision that almost certainly saved their lives.</p> <p>After the second world war he went to school first in Debrecen and then in Budapest, and in 1951 was accepted at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest to study Russian and literature. He was briefly expelled from the university by the authorities, who deemed him a \u201cclass alien\u201d due to his bourgeois background, but was readmitted in 1953 during the reformist prime ministership of Imre Nagy, switching to study Hungarian literature and graduating in 1956 shortly before the Hungarian revolution erupted.</p> <p>Konr\u00e1d fully supported the revolutionary call for independence and a multiparty system, and joined the pro-revolutionary National Guard. But when the Soviets crushed the revolution, he abandoned his tommy-gun in a dark alleyway.</p> <p>Just before the revolution Konr\u00e1d had had his first piece published in the periodical \u00daj Hang (New Voice). </p> <p>He joined a group of young aspiring writers and artists who met regularly in a Budapest coffee house, and, after an unsettled period working in various temporary jobs, found a permanent position as a social worker in the city.</p> <p>His six years of experience in that job were used in his first novel and his next job, as a sociologist at the Institute of Urban Planning, gave him material for his following novel, A V\u00e1rosalap\u00edt\u00f3, which was published in censored form in Hungary in 1977 and translated in the same year into English under the title The City Builder.</p> <p>By this time Konr\u00e1d had become a political player due to the clandestine publication of a study translated into English as The Intellectuals on the Road to Class Power that he had written with the sociologist Iv\u00e1n Szel\u00e9nyi. Copies of the publication, which argued against the Marxist view that the communist system is a dictatorship of the proletariat, were confiscated by the Hungarian security police and he and Szel\u00e9nyi were arrested \u2013 although as a result of international protests they were soon released.</p> <p>Szel\u00e9nyi subsequently emigrated, but Konr\u00e1d chose to stay in Hungary on condition that he received a permanent exit visa enabling him to publish and teach in Germany and the US. It was in New York that he wrote his third, most Hungarian, novel, A Cinkos (The Loser, published in English in 1983) with a brilliant chapter, The Feast Day, about the beginnings of the 1956 revolution, which Konr\u00e1d said was \u201cthe only event of world historical significance that we Hungarians accomplished in this [the 20th] century\u201d.</p> <p>Since he was on the list of Hungary\u2019s forbidden authors from 1977 until 1988, Konr\u00e1d\u2019s two political studies: Az Auton\u00f3mia Kis\u00e9rt\u00e9se (The Temptation of Autonomy, 1980) and the excellent Anti-politica (1986) were only published abroad.

      "bodyText": "This year has been a bumper one for anniversaries: Queen Victoria\u2019s 200th, Proms founder Sir Henry Wood\u2019s 150th and half-centuries apiece for the moon landings, Stonewall riots and Woodstock. You could be forgiven for not having also clocked the 50th anniversary of HarrisonParrott, one of the biggest names in classical music you\u2019ve probably never heard of. But if it doesn\u2019t ring any bells, the formidable roster of artists this agency manages certainly will: from pianist and conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy, represented by HP since 1969, to more recent headline-grabbers such as mezzo Jamie Barton, who triumphed at Last Night of the Proms this year, and award-winning Icelandic pianist V\u00edkingur \u00d3lafsson. No wonder HarrisonParrott\u2019s birthday bash (three concerts across a single day) was a starry affair, celebrating what co-founder Jasper Parrott called our \u201cgolden age of music\u201d. There was new talent \u2013 saxophonist Jess Gillam kicked off the opening event one with an explosion of tone colours in Piazzolla\u2019s unaccompanied Tango-Etude No 3; trumpeter Lucienne Renaudin Vary opened the second concert with a hazy, mellow performance of Duke Ellington\u2019s In a Sentimental Mood. There was established talent, from J\u00f6rg Widmann\u2019s breathtaking account of his own brilliantly irreverent Fantasie for solo clarinet to soprano Barbara Hannigan\u2019s selection from Wolf\u2019s Goethe Lieder, a masterclass in how to create musical drama with vowels and consonants, minutely supported by pianist Tamara Stefanovich. And there were offerings from the old guard: the London premiere, with the composer in attendance, of Harrison Birtwistle\u2019s Keyboard Engine for two pianos \u2013 all hard edges and sharp jabs ricocheting between Stefanovich and Pierre-Laurent Aimard. There was also a messy if impassioned performance of Elgar\u2019s Enigma Variations by the Philharmonia Orchestra under Ashkenazy. If you\u2019re wondering how this could fit together into three conventional 21st-century programmes, rest assured that it didn\u2019t. These were concerts on an older model \u2013 a 19th-century one \u2013 in which celebrity musicians would contribute their current party piece, generating marathon pick\u2019n\u2019mix concerts. Programming has since become a more sober, less flexible affair.

The orchestra\u2019s principal conductor designate Santtu-Matias Rouvali \u2013 expressive to his fingertips \u2013 produced an even bigger-boned Rosenkavalier Suite (albeit deliciously flexible with tempi), and Elim Chan delivered an extravagantly Romantic reading of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Romeo and Juliet overture before Ashkenazy\u2019s Elgar.

      "body": "<p>This Sunday was the Bayern Munich squad\u2019s traditional drop-in to Oktoberfest. It\u2019s an iconic scene with the players and their families, who dress up in traditional Bavarian outfits of lederhosen and toast the moment. The atmosphere is often heady. On one occasion, the story goes, Pep Guardiola spontaneously decided that he and his charges should commandeer a private jet to fly off and watch Juventus take on Roma in a Serie A top-of-the-table clash in Turin.</p> \n<p>This time, the mood was slightly different. Manuel Neuer \u201ccould be happy\u201d, wrote S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u2019s Lisa Sonnabend. \u201cHe can have a drink on Sunday at the Oktoberfest, because in Wednesday\u2019s friendly against Argentina Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen will be in the Germany goal.\u201d The question of who should be between the sticks for the national team might still be a prickly one but normally we might have privately suggested that Neuer could get a start on the festivities on the Saturday, given Hoffenheim were the visitors to Allianz Arena.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"534cc244662762d393e1c12fde9b1d0df02391c9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/534cc244662762d393e1c12fde9b1d0df02391c9/0_176_3456_3178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas M\u00fcller at the Kaeferschaenke beer tent on Sunday for Oktoberfest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"920\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas M\u00fcller at the Kaeferschaenke beer tent on Sunday for Oktoberfest.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gisela Schober/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Alfred Schreuder\u2019s side arrived from Sinsheim having won just one of their opening six fixtures (and Werder Bremen are still trying to figure how they lost that one), having scored a measly four goals. They hardly had a record in Munich to inspire, having not won in their previous 12 visits under, in most cases, more lauded coaches that Schreuder, including Ralf Rangnick and Julian Nagelsmann. Since the Dutchman took over from Nagelsmann, critics have suggested he was really a No 2, floundering and out of his depth.</p> \n<p>As Hoffenheim arrived to face a Bayern that were still emitting smoke after their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/02/bayern-munich-spurs-german-media-react-reminiscent-germany-7-brazil-1\">flaming of Tottenham</a>, it was hard to see shock potential. The champions were unbeaten this season, unbeaten in 20 league games at home and Niko Kovac made just one change from the Spurs demolition, with Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara coming in for the injured David Alaba.</p> \n<p>Schreuder had given a bold press conference on Thursday. \u201cTo sit back and wait just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe have a plan and we\u2019ll get our chances.\u201d Even if that was the case, the question remained of who would be able to take them. Hoffenheim\u2019s best attacking player, Andrej Kramari\u0107, has been injured and badly missed, while there was no Ishak Belfoldil either.</p> \n<p>Enter Sargis Adamyan, a German-born Armenian international centre-forward signed on the back of 15 Bundesliga 2 goals for Jahn Regensburg last season and who, at 26, had never played a top-flight game before this term. He had never started one before Saturday.

      "bodyText": "This Sunday was the Bayern Munich squad\u2019s traditional drop-in to Oktoberfest. It\u2019s an iconic scene with the players and their families, who dress up in traditional Bavarian outfits of lederhosen and toast the moment. The atmosphere is often heady. On one occasion, the story goes, Pep Guardiola spontaneously decided that he and his charges should commandeer a private jet to fly off and watch Juventus take on Roma in a Serie A top-of-the-table clash in Turin. This time, the mood was slightly different. Manuel Neuer \u201ccould be happy\u201d, wrote S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u2019s Lisa Sonnabend. \u201cHe can have a drink on Sunday at the Oktoberfest, because in Wednesday\u2019s friendly against Argentina Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen will be in the Germany goal.\u201d The question of who should be between the sticks for the national team might still be a prickly one but normally we might have privately suggested that Neuer could get a start on the festivities on the Saturday, given Hoffenheim were the visitors to Allianz Arena. Alfred Schreuder\u2019s side arrived from Sinsheim having won just one of their opening six fixtures (and Werder Bremen are still trying to figure how they lost that one), having scored a measly four goals. They hardly had a record in Munich to inspire, having not won in their previous 12 visits under, in most cases, more lauded coaches that Schreuder, including Ralf Rangnick and Julian Nagelsmann. Since the Dutchman took over from Nagelsmann, critics have suggested he was really a No 2, floundering and out of his depth. As Hoffenheim arrived to face a Bayern that were still emitting smoke after their flaming of Tottenham, it was hard to see shock potential. The champions were unbeaten this season, unbeaten in 20 league games at home and Niko Kovac made just one change from the Spurs demolition, with Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara coming in for the injured David Alaba. Schreuder had given a bold press conference on Thursday. \u201cTo sit back and wait just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe have a plan and we\u2019ll get our chances.\u201d Even if that was the case, the question remained of who would be able to take them. Hoffenheim\u2019s best attacking player, Andrej Kramari\u0107, has been injured and badly missed, while there was no Ishak Belfoldil either. Enter Sargis Adamyan, a German-born Armenian international centre-forward signed on the back of 15 Bundesliga 2 goals for Jahn Regensburg last season and who, at 26, had never played a top-flight game before this term. He had never started one before Saturday. Yet by 5.20pm in Munich he was the unlikely hero of the unlikeliest of wins, as Schreuder looked every bit the seasoned head coach as he maniacally pumped both fists in front of the main stand. Adamyan had an early chance to spring a shock, charging through and leaving J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng in his wake, only to lose his duel with Neuer. It was the first and last time his play hinted at any sort of greenness. Adamyan led the line admirably and after his first strike was cancelled out by the rather more familiar sight of Robert Lewandowski filling the net, he was on the end of an even more improbable twist, again giving Boateng and Niklas S\u00fcle the slip on the edge of the Bayern penalty area to guide in a crafted finish. \u201cI still can\u2019t quite believe it,\u201d Adamyan sighed. \u201cThis is a huge dream for me. I was still playing in the Regionalliga (fourth tier) two years ago,\u201d he told Sky. \u201cI scored a hat-trick in Hamburg last season. But I think this is a bit bigger.\u201d You can say that again. The last time Bayern lost a Bundesliga game at home had been almost a year to the day, when they were humbled 3-0 by Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in the midst of the last Oktoberfest. Hoffenheim\u2019s victory may not have been quite as comprehensive, but it was not a smash-and-grab, and it stung Bayern. It was a result that was, in the words of Kovac, \u201cnot undeserved\u201d. Despite ending a considerable run of invincibility, it underlined how the perception of Bayern has changed under Kovac. Teams come to Munich not as cannon fodder, but in the hope of pulling off a shock. They dare to dream big. There was very little dreamy about Bayern\u2019s display, as flat as their second half at Spurs had been scintillating.

Hoffenheim\u2019s \u2013 and Schreuder\u2019s \u2013 plan had been more failsafe than Kovac\u2019s.

Pentland said those assurances were unequivocal.</p> <p>\u201cI approach matters on the basis that it would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do,\u201d the judge ruled. </p> <p>As a result he stated: \u201cI am not persuaded that it is necessary for the court to grant the orders sought or any variant of them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/06/how-far-away-uk-eu-from-reaching-brexit-deal\">How far away are UK and EU from reaching a Brexit deal?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act, known as the Benn act, states that if Westminster does not agree to a Brexit deal by 19 October, the prime minister has to write to the EU seeking an extension to article 50 until 31 January.</p> <p>Pentland dismissed arguments by Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the lawyer for the anti-Brexit campaigners, that Johnson and officials at No 10 were already plotting to thwart the act\u2019s provisions, and had said so repeatedly.</p> <p>\u201cI am not satisfied that the petitioners have made out their case based on reasonable apprehension of breach of statutory duty on the part of the prime minister,\u201d the judge said.</p> <p>Their request to him for an interdict blocking the prime minister from frustrating the Benn act, say by appealing in secret for an EU member state to reject the UK\u2019s request for an extension, was not specific enough. \u201cThe terms of the interdict are not sufficiently precise and clear,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIn my view, this language is too broad.\u201d<br><br>The UK government\u2019s lawyers told the court on Friday Johnson would write that letter if required and argued that a legally binding order was therefore not needed.</p> <p>The government also promised not to thwart the act\u2019s provisions by lobbying EU member states to reject calls for an extension to article 50.<br><br>Anti-Brexit campaigners are expected to appeal against the decision on Tuesday, when they will ask another Scottish court to write the article 50 extension letter if Johnson fails to do so.</p> <p>The campaigners \u2013 Dale Vince, a green energy entrepreneur, Jolyon Maugham QC, an anti-Brexit campaigner, and Joanna Cherry QC, a Scottish National party MP \u2013 want the inner house of the court of session to use its unique <em>nobile officium</em> powers to act on Johnson\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>Those powers allow the court of session to take action in a situation where a remedy is needed, but this case is seen as highly unusual.</p> <p>Maugham said he was disappointed by the ruling but said the case had nonetheless extracted a promise from the UK government to honour the Benn act. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/1181175169437622279?s=20\">He tweeted</a>: \u201cAs we have extracted promises from the government, the question whether this loss matters depends on whether you think I am right or the court is right. But, on any view, there are now risks of an unlawful Brexit that would not, had the decision gone the other way, have existed.\u201d</p> <p>The applicants had hoped Pentland would rule in their favour after the government\u2019s promise appeared to have been contradicted as Friday\u2019s hearing was taking place, when an unnamed Downing Street source told the BBC the government was already planning to sidestep the Benn act.</p> <p>Soon after the court heard Johnson was promising to send the extension letter, the BBC\u2019s source appeared to downplay the significance of that pledge. He said the Benn act\u2019s provisions imposed \u201ca very specific narrow duty [which] can be interpreted in different ways.</p> <p>\u201cBut the government is not prevented by the act from doing other things that cause no delay, including other communications, private and public. People will have to wait to see how this is reconciled. The government is making its true position on delay known privately in Europe and this will become public soon.\u201d</p> <p>Those quotes were read to Pentland by O\u2019Neill, the lawyer for Vince, Maugham and Cherry, just after the government\u2019s promises had been set out to the court by Andrew Webster QC. O\u2019Neill said the remarks to the BBC proved that the government could not be trusted. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Anti-Brexit campaigners have failed in an attempt to force Boris Johnson to ask for an extension to article 50 if he is unable to get a Brexit deal through parliament. Lord Pentland, sitting in the court of session in Edinburgh, rejected their request for a court order instructing the prime minister to seek an extension if he cannot get a deal passed by the Commons this month. Pentland said he had to take at face value pledges made by the UK government on Friday that Johnson would write the letter seeking an extension on 19 October as required under the so-called Benn act. Pentland said those assurances were unequivocal. \u201cI approach matters on the basis that it would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do,\u201d the judge ruled. As a result he stated: \u201cI am not persuaded that it is necessary for the court to grant the orders sought or any variant of them.\u201d The European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act, known as the Benn act, states that if Westminster does not agree to a Brexit deal by 19 October, the prime minister has to write to the EU seeking an extension to article 50 until 31 January. Pentland dismissed arguments by Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the lawyer for the anti-Brexit campaigners, that Johnson and officials at No 10 were already plotting to thwart the act\u2019s provisions, and had said so repeatedly. \u201cI am not satisfied that the petitioners have made out their case based on reasonable apprehension of breach of statutory duty on the part of the prime minister,\u201d the judge said. Their request to him for an interdict blocking the prime minister from frustrating the Benn act, say by appealing in secret for an EU member state to reject the UK\u2019s request for an extension, was not specific enough. \u201cThe terms of the interdict are not sufficiently precise and clear,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIn my view, this language is too broad.\u201d The UK government\u2019s lawyers told the court on Friday Johnson would write that letter if required and argued that a legally binding order was therefore not needed. The government also promised not to thwart the act\u2019s provisions by lobbying EU member states to reject calls for an extension to article 50. Anti-Brexit campaigners are expected to appeal against the decision on Tuesday, when they will ask another Scottish court to write the article 50 extension letter if Johnson fails to do so. The campaigners \u2013 Dale Vince, a green energy entrepreneur, Jolyon Maugham QC, an anti-Brexit campaigner, and Joanna Cherry QC, a Scottish National party MP \u2013 want the inner house of the court of session to use its unique nobile officium powers to act on Johnson\u2019s behalf. Those powers allow the court of session to take action in a situation where a remedy is needed, but this case is seen as highly unusual. Maugham said he was disappointed by the ruling but said the case had nonetheless extracted a promise from the UK government to honour the Benn act. He tweeted: \u201cAs we have extracted promises from the government, the question whether this loss matters depends on whether you think I am right or the court is right. But, on any view, there are now risks of an unlawful Brexit that would not, had the decision gone the other way, have existed.\u201d The applicants had hoped Pentland would rule in their favour after the government\u2019s promise appeared to have been contradicted as Friday\u2019s hearing was taking place, when an unnamed Downing Street source told the BBC the government was already planning to sidestep the Benn act. Soon after the court heard Johnson was promising to send the extension letter, the BBC\u2019s source appeared to downplay the significance of that pledge. He said the Benn act\u2019s provisions imposed \u201ca very specific narrow duty [which] can be interpreted in different ways. \u201cBut the government is not prevented by the act from doing other things that cause no delay, including other communications, private and public. People will have to wait to see how this is reconciled. The government is making its true position on delay known privately in Europe and this will become public soon.\u201d Those quotes were read to Pentland by O\u2019Neill, the lawyer for Vince, Maugham and Cherry, just after the government\u2019s promises had been set out to the court by Andrew Webster QC. O\u2019Neill said the remarks to the BBC proved that the government could not be trusted.",

      "body": "<p>Jennifer Arcuri, the woman whose friendship with Boris Johnson has placed her at the centre of a growing political storm, gave her first live broadcast interview on Monday, speaking to ITV\u2019s Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid for almost an hour. Despite the length of the exchange, though, significant questions remained for the prime minister.</p> \n<h2><strong>1. Why did </strong><strong> Johnson fail to declare an interest over </strong><strong> Arcuri and her companies when he was mayor of London?</strong></h2> \n<p>During her interview, Arcuri refused nine times to answer direct questions about whether she had an intimate relationship with Johnson. But she also made it clear that she shared a \u201cvery close bond\u201d with the then mayor of London. Johnson told The Andrew Marr Show last week that he had no interest to declare over Arcuri. But her comments on Monday suggest otherwise. She confirmed he visited her flat (where she said her office was also based) a \u201chandful\u201d of times, that they joked about pole dancing, talked about Shakespeare and technology, and that he spoke for free at four of her events. Despite the closeness of the relationship, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/mayoral/boris-johnson-mp-past-staff/register-of-interests\">Johnson\u2019s register of interests as mayor</a> makes no mention of Arcuri or her companies.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/07/jennifer-arcuri-refuses-to-rule-out-claims-of-affair-with-boris-johnson\">Jennifer Arcuri refuses to rule out claims of affair with Boris Johnson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>2. Why did Johnson\u2019s office intervene to give Arcuri a place on trade missions</strong><strong> to Tel Aviv and New York after she was initially told she did not meet the criteria</strong><strong>?</strong></h2> \n<p>Arcuri suggested the initial decision to refuse her place was due to an overly restrictive interpretation of the criteria. She was initially refused a place on a technology trade trade trip to Singapore and Malaysia in 2014 because her company, Innotech, was an events company not a technology company. To get round this requirement she was allowed on the trip as representative of her new video technology company, Playbox, even though it had been trading less than the required 12 months necessary to qualify for a place.</p> \n<p>London and Partners [L&amp;P], the mayor\u2019s promotion agency, which ran the trip, said it was not unusual for the rules to be waived in this way. But this exception made for Arcuri on the Singapore trip does not explain why she was subsequently allowed on trade missions to Tel Aviv and New York. Despite not qualifying for these events, L&amp;P said one of the mayor\u2019s advisers said she should be allowed a place.</p> \n<p>Arcuri on Monday insisted she was vetted by an \u201cextremely fierce\u201d woman in charge of the trips. \u201cShe didn\u2019t let me pass because I was Boris\u2019s friend. She wanted to know that I was actually doing real business there and spent time learning about me.\u201d Her answer still does not explain why one of Johnson\u2019s advisers intervened on Arcuri\u2019s behalf for the trade trips to New York and Tel Aviv.</p> \n<h2><strong>3. Why did the </strong><strong>Department </strong><strong>for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport</strong><strong> (DCMS) approach Arcuri\u2019s company before awarding her new company, Hacker House, \u00a3100,000 earlier this year?</strong></h2> \n<p>Lots of questions have already been asked about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/01/former-tory-minister-appalled-over-jennifer-arcuri-allegations\">how much the DCMS did to verify whether Hacker House</a> was genuinely a UK company before awarding it \u00a3100,000 from a scheme aimed at fostering digital skills in this country. Arcuri insisted the company was based in the UK and had eight UK staff when the money was awarded. But she also claimed the DCMS suggested she should apply for the funds in the first place.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cThey came to us and said, \u2018Hey, we have this pot of money.\u2019 And I said: \u2018Wow, you have a pot of money to do exactly as we are doing with the technology we were building.\u2019 Why wouldn\u2019t you fund us?\u201d She insisted Johnson had \u201cabsolutely nothing to do with my grant\u201d. She was not asked why the DCMS approached her to apply, but she suggested officials were worried that not enough companies were applying for the funds.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cMy company has developed an extremely effective hands on hacking course, that allows people to enter industry based on the skills they achieve in my course. This is a massive problem across the UK and the United States. DCMS were far more concerned with fulfilling that quota and that need, so they came to us.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>4. Why did Arcuri claim that</strong><strong> Johnson wrote her a letter of recommendation to run a tech quango?</strong></h2> \n<p>Arcuri told ITV that her then friend Milo Yiannopoulos, the rightwing commentator, suggested she apply for the job of chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/27/tech-city-digital-startups-shoreditch\">Tech City</a>, an organisation set up by Downing Street to champion technology companies in London. She suggested to ITV that she went along with the idea to humour Yiannopoulos.</p> \n<p>But the Sunday Times reported that Arcuri boasted of still having a letter of recommendation from Johnson. It quoted an email from her as saying \u201cI still have the letter of rec from Boris. Hahaha. To think that we asked him to write us a recommendation for the CEO of Tech City is just hysterical.\u201d On Monday she said: \u201cThat letter doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Asked to explain the email, she said she was \u201cjust playing along\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. Why did Johnson speak at four Innotech events for free when he rarely spoke at other tech events?</strong></h2> \n<p>Other companies organising tech conferences in London at the time were puzzled by why Johnson only seemed to talk at Arcuri\u2019s event. She claimed he chose to attend her events on merit, saying: \u201cIt made him look like a rock star within the tech community \u2026 I produce really good, very sexy, chic, on-point, thought-leading events. There was no other events series like Innotech, none.\u201d</p> \n<p>She continued: \u201cI always made sure that Boris got a win out of my events \u2026 Every event that he came to had a strategic advantage for him.\u201d But it is still unclear what strategic advantage Johnson gained. When he spoke at the launch event of Innotech in 2012, Arcuri admitted \u201cjaws hit the floor when he showed up\u201d. She suggested Johnson was doing it to secure her participation in his 2012 reelection campaign as mayor, saying: \u201cWhen he left, he said, \u2018Jenn, see you on the Boris bus,\u2019because I told him if you come to this, I\u2019ll help with your campaign.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"74a50521-4ea8-4665-a6b7-e83487d5d6b1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/td-QUwD8VlQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Jennifer Arcuri, the woman whose friendship with Boris Johnson has placed her at the centre of a growing political storm, gave her first live broadcast interview on Monday, speaking to ITV\u2019s Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid for almost an hour. Despite the length of the exchange, though, significant questions remained for the prime minister. 1. Why did Johnson fail to declare an interest over Arcuri and her companies when he was mayor of London? During her interview, Arcuri refused nine times to answer direct questions about whether she had an intimate relationship with Johnson. But she also made it clear that she shared a \u201cvery close bond\u201d with the then mayor of London. Johnson told The Andrew Marr Show last week that he had no interest to declare over Arcuri. But her comments on Monday suggest otherwise. She confirmed he visited her flat (where she said her office was also based) a \u201chandful\u201d of times, that they joked about pole dancing, talked about Shakespeare and technology, and that he spoke for free at four of her events. Despite the closeness of the relationship, Johnson\u2019s register of interests as mayor makes no mention of Arcuri or her companies. 2. Why did Johnson\u2019s office intervene to give Arcuri a place on trade missions to Tel Aviv and New York after she was initially told she did not meet the criteria? Arcuri suggested the initial decision to refuse her place was due to an overly restrictive interpretation of the criteria. She was initially refused a place on a technology trade trade trip to Singapore and Malaysia in 2014 because her company, Innotech, was an events company not a technology company. To get round this requirement she was allowed on the trip as representative of her new video technology company, Playbox, even though it had been trading less than the required 12 months necessary to qualify for a place. London and Partners [L&amp;P], the mayor\u2019s promotion agency, which ran the trip, said it was not unusual for the rules to be waived in this way. But this exception made for Arcuri on the Singapore trip does not explain why she was subsequently allowed on trade missions to Tel Aviv and New York. Despite not qualifying for these events, L&amp;P said one of the mayor\u2019s advisers said she should be allowed a place. Arcuri on Monday insisted she was vetted by an \u201cextremely fierce\u201d woman in charge of the trips. \u201cShe didn\u2019t let me pass because I was Boris\u2019s friend. She wanted to know that I was actually doing real business there and spent time learning about me.\u201d Her answer still does not explain why one of Johnson\u2019s advisers intervened on Arcuri\u2019s behalf for the trade trips to New York and Tel Aviv. 3. Why did the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) approach Arcuri\u2019s company before awarding her new company, Hacker House, \u00a3100,000 earlier this year? Lots of questions have already been asked about how much the DCMS did to verify whether Hacker House was genuinely a UK company before awarding it \u00a3100,000 from a scheme aimed at fostering digital skills in this country. Arcuri insisted the company was based in the UK and had eight UK staff when the money was awarded. But she also claimed the DCMS suggested she should apply for the funds in the first place. She said: \u201cThey came to us and said, \u2018Hey, we have this pot of money.\u2019 And I said: \u2018Wow, you have a pot of money to do exactly as we are doing with the technology we were building.\u2019 Why wouldn\u2019t you fund us?\u201d She insisted Johnson had \u201cabsolutely nothing to do with my grant\u201d. She was not asked why the DCMS approached her to apply, but she suggested officials were worried that not enough companies were applying for the funds. She said: \u201cMy company has developed an extremely effective hands on hacking course, that allows people to enter industry based on the skills they achieve in my course. This is a massive problem across the UK and the United States. DCMS were far more concerned with fulfilling that quota and that need, so they came to us.\u201d 4. Why did Arcuri claim that Johnson wrote her a letter of recommendation to run a tech quango? Arcuri told ITV that her then friend Milo Yiannopoulos, the rightwing commentator, suggested she apply for the job of chief executive of Tech City, an organisation set up by Downing Street to champion technology companies in London. She suggested to ITV that she went along with the idea to humour Yiannopoulos. But the Sunday Times reported that Arcuri boasted of still having a letter of recommendation from Johnson. It quoted an email from her as saying \u201cI still have the letter of rec from Boris. Hahaha. To think that we asked him to write us a recommendation for the CEO of Tech City is just hysterical.\u201d On Monday she said: \u201cThat letter doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Asked to explain the email, she said she was \u201cjust playing along\u201d. 5. Why did Johnson speak at four Innotech events for free when he rarely spoke at other tech events? Other companies organising tech conferences in London at the time were puzzled by why Johnson only seemed to talk at Arcuri\u2019s event. She claimed he chose to attend her events on merit, saying: \u201cIt made him look like a rock star within the tech community \u2026 I produce really good, very sexy, chic, on-point, thought-leading events. There was no other events series like Innotech, none.\u201d She continued: \u201cI always made sure that Boris got a win out of my events \u2026 Every event that he came to had a strategic advantage for him.\u201d But it is still unclear what strategic advantage Johnson gained. When he spoke at the launch event of Innotech in 2012, Arcuri admitted \u201cjaws hit the floor when he showed up\u201d. She suggested Johnson was doing it to secure her participation in his 2012 reelection campaign as mayor, saying: \u201cWhen he left, he said, \u2018Jenn, see you on the Boris bus,\u2019because I told him if you come to this, I\u2019ll help with your campaign.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "So there we have it, this year\u2019s Nobel prize in physiology or medicine goes to a trio of scientists for their work in unpicking how cells sense and respond to changes in oxygen levels. Check out Ian Sample\u2019s news story here: (he\u2019s just been on the phone to the newly minted laureate Sir Peter Ratcliffe). And don\u2019t forget to join us tomorrow for the Nobel prize in physics from 10:15am! Prof Bridget Lumb, president of the Physiological Society, has released her thoughts \u2013 again stressing how this year\u2019s prize is really a celebration of a fundamental biological mechanism. \u201cThis year\u2019s Nobel prize puts physiology front and centre. It shines a light on the vital research carried out by physiologists,\u201d she said.\u201cCutting edge physiological research such as this is improving our understanding of how our bodies work and thereby helping keep us healthy. \u201cThanks to this research we know much more about how different levels of oxygen impact on physiological processes in our bodies. This has huge implications for everything from recovery from injury and protection from disease, through to improving exercise performance.\u201d Kaelin\u2019s thoughts on receiving the call have come out \u2013 apparently he was speaking to AP. \u201cI was aware as a scientist that if you get a phone call at 5am with too many digits, it\u2019s sometimes very good news, and my heart started racing. It was all a bit surreal,\u201d he said. Hellmut Augustin, director of the European Centre for Angioscience, is very excited about today\u2019s prize, saying it has been awarded for the discovery of a very fundamental mechanism of life. \u201cThe hypoxia program controls the expression of hundreds of molecules. Among the more prominently oxygen regulated molecules are the master switch of blood vessel growth VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and the key regulator of erythrocyte [red blood cell] production, erythropoietin,\u201d he said. \u201cHypoxia regulation of gene expression governs all kind of biological processes and diseases ranging from the retinopathy of prematurity in newborns, to the growth of blood vessels in tumours to high altitude training of athletes,\u201d he added. Nobel selfies seem to be a new thing. More reaction \u2013 this time from Dr Alex Greenhough at the University of the West of England who works on cancer biology. \u201cThe work by Ratcliffe, Kaelin and Semenza has been crucial to our understanding of how cells sense and respond to changes in oxygen levels,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir work is of huge significance to diseases that feature an impaired blood supply, which includes important solid tumours such as breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Their outstanding work on the fundamental mechanisms of oxygen sensing will pave the way for future therapies that will be able to exploit the disease-specific nature of hypoxia for clinical benefit\u201d Just in case you feel that Gregg Semenza has been left out of the proceedings on the blog, here is a picture of him post-win. https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/1181159403409612801 Ian Sample has a news story up already on this year\u2019s prize \u2013 take a look here. We will be adding further details and reaction to the award as it comes in. Reaction to this year\u2019s award is coming in. Dr Andrew Murray from the department of physiology, development and neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, said the award was richly deserved and offered the trio his congratulations. \u201cOxygen is fundamental to animal life, allowing our mitochondria to extract energy from the food we eat. The work of Kaelin, Ratcliffe and Semenza revealed the elegant mechanisms by which our cells sense oxygen levels and respond to fluctuations, enhancing the delivery of oxygen to the tissues of the body and altering our metabolism,\u201d he said. \u201cSince the first reports of the hypoxia inducible factors appeared in the early 1990s, we have come to realise the vital role they play in our everyday physiology, in allowing humans to live at high altitude and in countless biomedical scenarios. Hypoxia (a low tissue oxygen content) is a feature of many diseases including heart failure, chronic lung disease and many cancers. The work of these three scientists and their teams has paved the way to a greater understanding of these common, life-threatening conditions and new strategies to treat them.\u201d Some have noted that, once again, all the winners are male. Only 12 women have been awarded the prize since the awards began. The last woman to win the award was Tu Youyou in 2015. Sir Peter Ratcliffe appears to be taking the win in his stride. My colleague Ian Sample previously covered the 2016 Lasker prize: here is his piece on Ratcliffe\u2019s work on how cells adapt to changes in oxygen levels. As Ian notes \u201cThe discovery has already led to a raft of experimental anaemia drugs that trick the body into thinking it is at high altitude, causing it to churn out more red blood cells.\u201d The Crick is rather happy... On winning the Lasker award for his work that has today been celebrated with a Nobel prize, William Kaelin noted the papers behind the discovery were published more than a decade ago. \u201cMost would be considered quaint, preliminary and barely publishable today,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOne \u2014 showing that a tumour-suppressor protein was required for oxygen signalling \u2014 would today be criticized for failing to include a clear mechanism and animal experiments.\u201d Today\u2019s win was perhaps not such a huge surprise \u2013 in 2016 the trio won the Albert Lasker award for basic medical research. The Lasker awards are sometimes referred to as America\u2019s Nobels, and previous winners often go on to win the Nobel itself. The impact of the discovery celebrated by this year\u2019s award is wide-ranging, with the body\u2019s response to changing oxygen levels implicated in everything from exercise to foetal development. It\u2019s also involved in a number of diseases \u2013 patients with chronic renal failure produce less EPO, and as a result often suffer from severe anaemia. In cancer, tumours use the oxygen-regulated system to trigger the development of new blood vessels \u2013 an area that is being investigated for new ways to tackle the disease. This year\u2019s prize is a true physiology award. At its heart is the body\u2019s response to low oxygen conditions. When the body is deprived of oxygen, there is a rise in the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) \u2013 this then boosts the production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. But how does a drop in oxygen trigger this response? This year\u2019s laureates found the answer. They found that when oxygen levels drop, levels of a protein complex (dubbed HIF) increase. Under normal oxygen conditions, HIF is rapidly broken down - but under low oxygen conditions it builds up. Crucially this complex binds to segments of DNA near the gene for EPO, regulating the expression of the gene and hence levels of EPO. The researchers also unpicked how HIF is modified under normal conditions so that it is rapidly broken down inside cells, revealing the key role of oxygen-sensitive enzymes. Want to know how to win a Nobel prize? Here is a top tip from the lab of William Kaelin, one of this year\u2019s laureates According to the committee, the mechanism by which cells adapt to oxygen levels is a key reason animals have managed to colonise so many habitats, as it means they can cope with living at different altitudes. The committee are now taking questions. Apparently all three laureates were contacted by phone, but they didn\u2019t have a phone number for Kaelin so they had to wake up his sister by phone to get hold of it. The impact of work on how cells adapt to oxygen levels is relevant to everything from pregnancy to altitude sickness to cancer and wound healing. The committee say that while it has long been known that oxygen is essential to sustain life, the molecular mechanisms that underpin how exactly cells adapt when oxygen supply drops or rises was something of a mystery. Until this year\u2019s laureates set to work. They have unpicked how the activity of genes is regulated in response to varying levels of oxygen. There we have it: this year\u2019s award is split three ways between researchers who have delved into how cells sense oxygen availability and adapt in response to that. Sir Peter Ratcliffe is based at the Francis Crick Institute in London. Kaelin and Semenza are based at Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University respectively. And here they are, the committee members have arrived \u2026 I\u2019m really regretting having a huge mug of coffee this morning. This is not the moment for a break... The fog lifts. Journalists are rustling papers. Hush descends... Any minute now the committee members will walk in and spill the beans on this year\u2019s winners. As usual the committee has shared an awkward photograph of an official grinning happily while dialling the winners. But if past calls are anything to go by they are more likely to be met \u2013 at least at first \u2013 with doubt and suspicion than gasps of joy from the unsuspecting recipient. After a few moments of confusion, the Swedish accent and repeated assurances presumably turns the dream into a reality. However, not all calls go smoothly. Physiology or medicine laureate May-Britt Moser said she initially didn\u2019t want to take the call when she was phoned in 2014, as she didn\u2019t recognise the number and was busy. Meanwhile the 2013 literature laureate, Alice Munro, didn\u2019t pick up \u2013 and the committee were left talking to her voicemail, and 2010 chemistry laureate Martin Chalfie slept on as his phone rang, missing the call. For those who like to see the glint of excitement in the committee members\u2019 eyes, you can follow the live video feed of the event here. At the moment it has a foggy filter, presumably to evoke the idea that the winners are currently shrouded in mystery. What\u2019s the point of the Nobel prizes? Good question. Fortunately my colleagues Ian Sample and Hannah Devlin have delved into the issue for you, looking at cases of misjudged awards, what actually happens at the ceremony, and whether the awards have a diversity problem: as the team point out, more men called John have won Nobels than have Africans. Why not take a look while we are waiting for today\u2019s event to kick off. Each Nobel prize is set at nine million Swedish kronor \u2013 that\u2019s about \u00a3750,000. If there\u2019s more than one winner, they have to split the cash. But the prestige is priceless. And that\u2019s to say nothing of other perks: at the University of California, Berkeley, laureates get their own reserved car parking spaces. My colleague Ian Sample hit a home run last year with his prediction that Allison would be a winner, which more or less exhausts our team\u2019s luck for backing the right horse for the rest of the century. But there are no shortage of contenders for this year\u2019s prize. Among them are the scientists behind the gene-editing technique known as Crispr \u2013 although this has also been tipped for the chemistry prize. If Crispr does win, it is a knotty issue as to which of the four key scientists involved in its development would be honoured. Even if the maximum number of awards were given, one of Emmanuelle Charpentier, Jennifer Doudna, George Church and Fang Zheng will be left empty handed. Another multi-player possibility is optogenetics \u2013 a technique which, among other applications, allows researchers to turn neurons on or off using light. Again, it is not obvious who would receive the award as so many have been instrumental in its development. There is also the possibility this could win the chemistry prize. And what about research into the microbiome \u2013 that collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi and more that live on and in our bodies, and have been found to play an important role in our health? Among pioneering the researchers in this area is Jeffrey Gordon at Washington University in St Louis. Other possibilities include the researchers behind the discovery that particular genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of breast cancer \u2013 a finding that became headline news when Angelina Jolie revealed she underwent a double mastectomy after genetic testing showed that she carried the BRCA1 gene. Mary-Claire King at the University of Washington and Mark Skolnick at the University of Utah are among the researchers who pioneered this work. But it seems less likely that the prize would go to cancer research two years in a row. What is becoming increasingly clear is the clear-cut divisions of chemistry, physics and physiology or medicine, have become blurred as techniques and understandings from one discipline are harnessed for another and new approaches and fields of research blossom. Since it was first established in 1901, the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine has been awarded 109 times to 216 scientists. Last year\u2019s winners were James P Allison and Tasuku Honjo, who shared the prize for their work on cancer treatments which involve harnessing the body\u2019s immune system. You can read more about their work in this piece by my colleague Hannah Devlin: Another October, another collection of Nobel prizes. And as always, first up is the award in physiology or medicine. Somewhere around the world a phone is about the ring to tell a researcher that they have scooped the ultimate gong \u2013 and within the hour they will be headline news, fielding calls from journalists. The event today is being live-streamed from the Nobel assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, and I\u2019ll be here to share the build-up, winners and reaction with you.

Through the car window, my brother, sister and I, sticky and argumentative, would often see the backs of two of the Sansom brothers as they picked watercress from emerald-green waterbeds that had been cultivated for more than 200 years.

The repatriation of 43 ceremonial objects is the first of its kind from the UK under a project to mark the 250th anniversary next year of Captain James Cook\u2019s first voyage to Australia. The artefacts range from traditional body ornaments and slippers to a churinga, a wood or stone item believed to embody the spiritual double of a relative or ancestor, and clapsticks, a musical instrument used in Aboriginal ceremonies. The first artefacts will be repatriated in a formal ceremony in November to communities including the Aranda people and the Gangalidda Garawa, whose cultural heritage is said to date back more than 70,000 years. Mangubadijarri Yanner, a spokesman for the Gangalidda Garawa Native Title Aboriginal Corporation, said the handover was a \u201cfundamental part of the healing and reconciliation process\u201d. He said: \u201cBringing these sacred cultural heritage items back to the country is important and necessary for the purpose of cultural revitalisation, because locked deep within these items is our lore \u2013 our histories, our traditions and our stories.\u201d Manchester Museum, which is part of Manchester University, is the first UK institution to return sacred artefacts under an Australian government-funded project to repatriate items of cultural heritage to mark 250 years since Cook\u2019s voyage in 2020. The anniversary of his expedition has divided opinion in both Australia and New Zealand, where government-funded celebrations have been met with protests from indigenous communities. Last week the British high commissioner to New Zealand, Laura Clarke, expressed \u201cregret\u201d to local Iwi groups over the deaths of nine indigenous people in the initial meetings between Cook and M\u0101ori, but stopped short of an apology. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), which runs the repatriation project, said Cook\u2019s arrival marked the beginning of Aboriginals\u2019 \u201ccultural heritage being removed overseas\u201d. Esme Ward, the director of Manchester Museum, said: \u201cBy taking this action Manchester Museum will become more inclusive, caring and relevant to the communities it serves both locally and globally. \u201cOur work with AIATSIS to promote understanding between cultures, learn together and build new relationships for the future has never been more important or timely.

Premier League title 17 points clear of Rangers., 2:D - Sixteen wins in a row is a La Liga record they share with Real Madrid (2016). Despite this incredible run, Pep Guardiola's side only finished four points clear of Real Madrid that season., 3:B - Pep Guardiola's side drew at home against Everton and then did not drop a point until the last day of 2017, when they were held to a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace. They finished 19 points clear of Manchester United to win the Premier League, having collected 100 points and scored 106 goals., 4:D - Yes, It's Pep Guardiola again. Bayern cruised to the Bundesliga title but failed to win the Champions League as they suffered a humiliating 5-0 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in the semi-finals., 5:B - The Gunners finished seven points clear of Liverpool to win the title in 2001-02 and won their opening game of the next campaign before drawing 2-2 at West Ham., 6:B - It's a European record. Benfica went more than 11 months without dropping a point as won back-to-back titles. They didn't lose a game in the 1972-73 season but their run of victories came to an end with a 2-2 draw at Porto., 7:C - Ferguson\u2019s side stormed to the title in 1999-2000, winning their final 11 games of the season. They won their opening game of the next campaign before drawing 1-1 at Ipswich., 8:B - Sandwiched between two draws with Udinese, Roberto Mancini\u2019s side won 17 consecutive games in Serie A.

The abrupt change happened on Sunday, after a call between Donald Trump and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.

Flailing Trump losing control of impeachment narrative An increasingly erratic Trump is battling the building threat of impeachment, after a second whistleblower came forward to describe the president\u2019s scheme to leverage dirt on his political rival, Joe Biden, from the Ukrainian leadership.

Philippines president says he has autoimmune disease Rodrigo Duterte, the controversial president of the Philippines, has revealed he is suffering from the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, a condition that could cause serious health complications for the 74-year-old leader. Duterte\u2019s health has been subject to speculation ever since he became the country\u2019s oldest elected leader in 2016. \u201cOne of my eyes is smaller. It roams on its own,\u201d he said during a visit to Russia this weekend. \u201cThat\u2019s myasthenia gravis. It\u2019s a nerve malfunction. I got it from my grandfather.\u201d Prison deaths. A Filipino prison hospital chief has claimed that 20% of the inmates at the national Bilibid prison near Manila, a total of more than 5,000, die each year due to infectious diseases and prison violence. Drummer Ginger Baker, master and monster, dies at 80 Ginger Baker, the drummer whose private life was as turbulent as the sound he pioneered, has died aged 80. A jazz-trained drummer, his work with the band Cream helped build the foundations of modern rock, while he was also one of the first western musicians to embrace Afrobeat, establishing his own recording studio in Lagos, Nigeria. Yet Baker\u2019s relationships with his family were strained, and even his close friend and former bandmate Eric Clapton described him as \u201cscary, threatening\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u201d. Musical tributes. Among those who paid tribute to Baker after his death at the weekend were the two surviving Beatles, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys and Sir Mick Jagger, who called Baker \u201cfiery but extremely talented and innovative\u201d.

Must-reads How Sony censored Michael Winterbottom\u2019s Greed The prolific British film-maker Michael Winterbottom\u2019s new movie, Greed, is a satire of the fashion industry, starring Steve Coogan as a fictional tycoon in the mould of Sir Philip Green. But when Winterbottom wanted to add some real and shocking facts to the end credits, the studio pushed back, as he tells Catherine Shoard. Which way will Obama-Trump voters swing in 2020? For the first in the Guardian\u2019s new series about swing voters, Chris McGreal travels to white, working-class Monroe County, Michigan, to find out whether the former Obama voters who swung behind Trump in 2016 intend to stay loyal to the president in 2020. And the winners are \u2026 For some they are the pinnacle of recognition, for others they reek of western bias and sexism. Ian Sample and Hannah Devlin examine the history of the Nobel prizes and how they may change in future. Early on Monday morning the Nobel prize for medicine was split three ways between researchers who have delved into how cells sense oxygen availability and adapt in response to that. Life as a Latino in Trump\u2019s America Hate crimes have risen steadily since Trump\u2019s election in 2016, but the mass shootings in Gilroy, California, and El Paso, Texas, in August marked a shocking escalation in violence against Latinos \u2013 one that left families across the US living in fear, as Dani Anguiano discovers. Opinion A recent New York Times report found Americans are not nearly so polarised as they appear on Twitter, Fox News or MSNBC. John Harris finds the same is true of Brexit Britain, where towns such as Milton Keynes show few symptoms of the culture war. We are in danger of making the classic postmodern mistake of taking spectacle and skewed representation for reality. Sport The Miami Dolphins have already suffered a string of embarrassing losses in this young season. And yet, writes Melissa Jacobs, they\u2019re not the most dismal team in the NFL. Unlike the Jets, Washington, Bengals and Falcons, at least the Dolphins have a plan for the future. Several Premier League giants struggled this weekend, with Manchester City, United and Tottenham all going down to theoretically weaker teams. Liverpool were disappointing, too, but managed to scrape out a win against Leicester that puts them eight points clear at the top.

From the moment Antonio Conte agreed to replace Luciano Spalletti at Inter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/06/san-siro-showdown-conte-takes-on-sarri-in-battle-for-serie-a-supremacy\">anticipation had been building</a> for his first encounter with Juventus: the club with which he made his name as both a player and manager. The club he restored to glory after taking charge there in 2011. The club that has dominated Italian football ever since.</p> \n<p>Inter approached Conte this spring in the hope he could help them to tear down the juggernaut he built. After consecutive Champions League qualifications under Spalletti, it was time to take another step forward, to compete for the title instead of just a place in the top four.</p> \n<p>Conte could hardly have started any better. Inter won their first six games of the new Serie A season, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/16/after-552-days-juventus-finally-knocked-off-their-serie-a-perch\">breaking Juventus\u2019s run</a> of 552 consecutive days atop the division. They arrived for Sunday\u2019s <em>Derby d\u2019Italia</em> with a two-point advantage over the <em>Bianconeri</em>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/06/internazionale-juventus-serie-a-match-report\">Juventus return to the top after Gonzalo Higua\u00edn seals win over Inter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Maurizio Sarri wanted us to believe that such details did not matter. The Juventus manager was still getting settled himself, after replacing Massimiliano Allegri in the summer. Asked how damaging it would be to fall further behind Inter so early in the season, he replied: \u201cA number close to zero.\u201d</p> \n<p>The contrast between the two managers\u2019 demeanour was striking. Where Sarri sought to defuse tension, Conte appeared at risk of being consumed by it. He ended his pre-match press conference with a threat to quit football altogether, after losing patience with questions about a group of Juventus fans \u2013 not truly fans, but \u201cignorants\u201d, in Conte\u2019s view \u2013 who have campaigned to remove his star from the Walk of Fame outside Allianz Stadium. \u201cI would not be a great loss for football,\u201d Conte said, \u201cBut football will not be a great loss for me, either.\u201d</p> \n<p>It would certainly be a blow to Inter, thriving so far under his leadership. Even their midweek defeat by Barcelona offered grounds for encouragement, the <em>Nerazzurri</em> taking an early lead and threatening to build on it before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/02/barcelona-internazionale-champions-league-match-report\">eventually getting pegged back</a> at the Camp Nou. They were unable to repeat that fast start, however, in front of a sold-out San Siro on Sunday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Instead, Juventus struck first: Paulo Dybala surprising Stefan De Vrij and Samir Handanovic with his short backlift in the fourth minute. It was just one of a number of ways in which Juventus caught their opponents cold. Dybala\u2019s presence up front was a surprise in itself, as was that of Federico Bernardeschi in the No 10 role. The expectation had been that Gonzalo Higua\u00edn would start alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, with Aaron Ramsey playing behind them.</p> \n<p>Yet Sarri, decried for being too rigid in his team selections at Napoli and Chelsea, has shown in these first few weeks of the season that an old dog can learn new tricks. He abandoned his hallmark 4-3-3 in favour of a 4-3-1-2 to accommodate Ramsey, and now seems to be pressing ahead with the new formation even when the Welshman is absent.</p> \n<p>Juventus attacked Inter with long, direct passes during Sunday\u2019s opening exchanges \u2013 another surprise, given Sarri\u2019s usual preference for quick interchanges. Miralem Pjanic set up Dybala\u2019s goal with a ball over the top from his own half. Moments after the restart, Matthijs De Ligt launched a clearance to Ronaldo from the edge of the Juventus box. The Portuguese cut inside and hit the bar.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1180919363626573824\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udca5 WHAT A FINISH FROM DYBALA!<br><br>\u26ab\u26aa Juve strike first at the Giuseppe Meazza! <a href=\"https://t.co/q4zCuNvmCx\">pic.twitter.com/q4zCuNvmCx</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1180919363626573824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>For a moment it looked as though Inter might be swept away. Instead they drew level, Lautaro Mart\u00ednez converting from the penalty spot after a De Ligt handball. The score was 1-1 at half-time. Inter, though, had suffered a major blow, Stefano Sensi exiting with a thigh injury. Signed from Sassuolo in the summer, the midfielder has been the standout performer through this first part of the season: a 5ft 6in dynamo who can do everything: from shielding the defence and sitting in as a regista to breaking the lines and scoring critical goals.</p> \n<p>His replacement, Mat\u00edas Vecino, could not offer the same energy, and was sloppy in possession besides. A further setback arrived after the interval, when Diego God\u00edn exited with a knee complaint. Conte sent on Alessandro Bastoni, a 20-year-old who made his debut last month. The latter was at fault for Juventus\u2019s winning goal, ball-watching as Rodrigo Bentancur slid a pass behind him to Higua\u00edn, who buried his finish from close range. Those two players had come off the bench for Juventus: a vivid reminder of the contrasting depth of the teams\u2019 squads.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1180944146875518976\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u26bd HIGUAIN PUTS JUVE BACK IN FRONT!<br><br>\u26ab\u26aa Great build-up play from the Bianconeri and the substitute puts Sarri's team 2-1 up! <a href=\"https://t.co/BFLMCrsCrw\">pic.twitter.com/BFLMCrsCrw</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1180944146875518976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/06/internazionale-juventus-serie-a-match-report\">A 2-1 final scoreline</a> was a fair reflection of the game, and perhaps of the talent gap that still exists between the champions and their aspiring challengers. Conte lamented afterwards that Sarri could have put a hand over his eyes while picking his substitutes and still been guaranteed a good return. His own team, he insisted, were still a work in progress. What was striking, however, was how both teams already seemed to reflect their new managers\u2019 personalities. Conte\u2019s Inter battled furiously even when being outplayed, and had chances to add to their goal. Sarri\u2019s Juventus eased off the long balls after that initial barrage, and started to construct the familiar little triangles. Higua\u00edn\u2019s goal arrived at the end of a sequence of 24 passes.</p> \n<p>\u201cQuality players can produce a beautiful symphony,\u201d said Sarri at full-time, and he certainly has an abundance of those. Some were supposed to depart during the transfer window, and it was tempting to wonder how differently this game might have looked if Higua\u00edn had been sold or Dybala swapped with Romelu Lukaku.</p> \n<p>Juventus\u2019s failure to sell may yet have negative consequences. Certainly, it will be hard work to balance the books. The manager\u2019s job, however, is simply to use the tools at his disposal. Sarri did that to great effect. \u201cAt times,\u201d he reflected afterwards, \u201cI even enjoyed myself.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e15b25c75fb3e721d588663cde85e0062bc574c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e15b25c75fb3e721d588663cde85e0062bc574c/0_0_3072_1965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maurizio Sarri and Antonio Conte.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maurizio Sarri and Antonio Conte.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matteo Bazzi/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Napoli missed their chance to close the gap to Inter, drawing 0-0 at Torino.

      "bodyText": "After four-and-a-half months, the wait was finally over. From the moment Antonio Conte agreed to replace Luciano Spalletti at Inter, anticipation had been building for his first encounter with Juventus: the club with which he made his name as both a player and manager. The club he restored to glory after taking charge there in 2011. The club that has dominated Italian football ever since. Inter approached Conte this spring in the hope he could help them to tear down the juggernaut he built. After consecutive Champions League qualifications under Spalletti, it was time to take another step forward, to compete for the title instead of just a place in the top four. Conte could hardly have started any better. Inter won their first six games of the new Serie A season, breaking Juventus\u2019s run of 552 consecutive days atop the division. They arrived for Sunday\u2019s Derby d\u2019Italia with a two-point advantage over the Bianconeri. Maurizio Sarri wanted us to believe that such details did not matter. The Juventus manager was still getting settled himself, after replacing Massimiliano Allegri in the summer. Asked how damaging it would be to fall further behind Inter so early in the season, he replied: \u201cA number close to zero.\u201d The contrast between the two managers\u2019 demeanour was striking. Where Sarri sought to defuse tension, Conte appeared at risk of being consumed by it. He ended his pre-match press conference with a threat to quit football altogether, after losing patience with questions about a group of Juventus fans \u2013 not truly fans, but \u201cignorants\u201d, in Conte\u2019s view \u2013 who have campaigned to remove his star from the Walk of Fame outside Allianz Stadium. \u201cI would not be a great loss for football,\u201d Conte said, \u201cBut football will not be a great loss for me, either.\u201d It would certainly be a blow to Inter, thriving so far under his leadership. Even their midweek defeat by Barcelona offered grounds for encouragement, the Nerazzurri taking an early lead and threatening to build on it before eventually getting pegged back at the Camp Nou. They were unable to repeat that fast start, however, in front of a sold-out San Siro on Sunday. Instead, Juventus struck first: Paulo Dybala surprising Stefan De Vrij and Samir Handanovic with his short backlift in the fourth minute. It was just one of a number of ways in which Juventus caught their opponents cold. Dybala\u2019s presence up front was a surprise in itself, as was that of Federico Bernardeschi in the No 10 role. The expectation had been that Gonzalo Higua\u00edn would start alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, with Aaron Ramsey playing behind them. Yet Sarri, decried for being too rigid in his team selections at Napoli and Chelsea, has shown in these first few weeks of the season that an old dog can learn new tricks. He abandoned his hallmark 4-3-3 in favour of a 4-3-1-2 to accommodate Ramsey, and now seems to be pressing ahead with the new formation even when the Welshman is absent. Juventus attacked Inter with long, direct passes during Sunday\u2019s opening exchanges \u2013 another surprise, given Sarri\u2019s usual preference for quick interchanges. Miralem Pjanic set up Dybala\u2019s goal with a ball over the top from his own half. Moments after the restart, Matthijs De Ligt launched a clearance to Ronaldo from the edge of the Juventus box. The Portuguese cut inside and hit the bar. For a moment it looked as though Inter might be swept away. Instead they drew level, Lautaro Mart\u00ednez converting from the penalty spot after a De Ligt handball. The score was 1-1 at half-time. Inter, though, had suffered a major blow, Stefano Sensi exiting with a thigh injury. Signed from Sassuolo in the summer, the midfielder has been the standout performer through this first part of the season: a 5ft 6in dynamo who can do everything: from shielding the defence and sitting in as a regista to breaking the lines and scoring critical goals. His replacement, Mat\u00edas Vecino, could not offer the same energy, and was sloppy in possession besides. A further setback arrived after the interval, when Diego God\u00edn exited with a knee complaint. Conte sent on Alessandro Bastoni, a 20-year-old who made his debut last month. The latter was at fault for Juventus\u2019s winning goal, ball-watching as Rodrigo Bentancur slid a pass behind him to Higua\u00edn, who buried his finish from close range. Those two players had come off the bench for Juventus: a vivid reminder of the contrasting depth of the teams\u2019 squads. A 2-1 final scoreline was a fair reflection of the game, and perhaps of the talent gap that still exists between the champions and their aspiring challengers. Conte lamented afterwards that Sarri could have put a hand over his eyes while picking his substitutes and still been guaranteed a good return. His own team, he insisted, were still a work in progress. What was striking, however, was how both teams already seemed to reflect their new managers\u2019 personalities. Conte\u2019s Inter battled furiously even when being outplayed, and had chances to add to their goal. Sarri\u2019s Juventus eased off the long balls after that initial barrage, and started to construct the familiar little triangles. Higua\u00edn\u2019s goal arrived at the end of a sequence of 24 passes. \u201cQuality players can produce a beautiful symphony,\u201d said Sarri at full-time, and he certainly has an abundance of those. Some were supposed to depart during the transfer window, and it was tempting to wonder how differently this game might have looked if Higua\u00edn had been sold or Dybala swapped with Romelu Lukaku. Juventus\u2019s failure to sell may yet have negative consequences. Certainly, it will be hard work to balance the books. The manager\u2019s job, however, is simply to use the tools at his disposal. Sarri did that to great effect. \u201cAt times,\u201d he reflected afterwards, \u201cI even enjoyed myself.\u201d Talking points \u2022 Napoli missed their chance to close the gap to Inter, drawing 0-0 at Torino. And they owed a good chunk of the point to the goalkeeping of Alex Meret. \u2022 Marco Giampaolo\u2019s tenure as Milan manager is already at an end, a scruffy 2-1 win over Genoa \u2013 both teams ended with nine men \u2013 insufficient to persuade the club\u2019s directors that he deserved more time. This season has been a mess, and Giampaolo certainly did not seem to have matters in hand when he changed his formation, suggesting it was fundamentally not a good one for Krzysztof Piatek, after a single game (if true, how was that not picked up in pre-season?) But Milan have now been through seven managers in the past six seasons. The problems start higher up. \u2022 Ugly stuff at the end of Roma\u2019s draw at home to Cagliari. The Giallorossi thought they had grabbed a late winner through Nikola Kalinic, but the goal was disallowed for a push by the striker on Fabio Pisacane. Roma protested furiously as the defender lay prostate on the floor, having collided as a result with goalkeeper Robin Olsen. Pisacane subsequently left the pitch in a neck brace.",

The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the \u00a3 symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is Facebook launching a cryptocurrency?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who is in charge of Libra?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the 'Libra Association'. It functions as what is known as a 'stablecoin', pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.</p>\n    <p>The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions.</p>\n    <p>Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(\u00a38m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>However in October 2019 several of the companies that had been backing the initiative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/11/payment-firms-back-out-in-painful-blow-to-facebooks-cryptocurrency-libra\">announced that they were pulling out</a>, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Stripe.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How and when can I use it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With regulators asking questions and backing companies dropping out, it is unclear now if Libra is still viable. Facebook's original plans were that users could download Calibra, a digital wallet, that would allow them to send the currency to anyone with a smartphone. It is no longer clear which countries the coin will launch in first, if at all, though Facebook had said 'almost anybody' in the world with a smartphone would be able to download the app.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kari-paul\"><b>Kari Paul</b></a>&nbsp;in <i>San Francisco</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe remain supportive of Libra\u2019s aspirations and look forward to continued dialogue on ways to work together in the future.

If Philippe Chauvin\u2019s middle son, Nicolas, had still been alive they felt he would have loved it, too. </p> <p>It is almost 10 months now since Nicolas, aged 18, died while playing for Stade Fran\u00e7ais Espoirs against their counterparts from Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles. Rugby was his passion from the moment he first picked up a ball at his local club just east of Paris in 2005. Tragically, the young flanker\u2019s choice of sport cost him his life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/dec/18/france-rugby-union-deaths\">France facing up to clamour for rugby to change after spate of tragedies | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A double tackle fractured a cervical vertebra and he subsequently suffered a heart attack and brain damage. He underwent emergency surgery but died three days later.</p> <p>Not everyone, in the wake of such a grievous loss, would have the emotional resilience to tune into this World Cup. Philippe Chauvin, however, is a remarkable \u2013 and increasingly driven \u2013 man. Having played rugby himself for 25 years, he wants Nicolas\u2019s death <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/dec/18/france-rugby-union-deaths\" title=\"\">to galvanise the game\u2019s authorities</a>, in France and worldwide. At the end of last month he announced his intention to launch a manslaughter lawsuit aimed at uncovering the full facts behind his son\u2019s death.</p> <p>Chauvin, who works for the French national rail company SNCF, feels he owes it to Nicolas to check out every available avenue. Under French law, with the police investigation now closed, he is not allowed access to the file relating to his son\u2019s death unless he goes down the legal route. \u201cLosing a child is terrible, even more so because of a problem that could have been avoided. I\u2019m going ahead with this complaint because I do not want it to happen to others.</p> <p>\u201cI feel it is also my duty to Nicolas to do everything so that the facts and responsibilities are established.

There may be things that I do not know or positions that are not the ones I was told.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76cf927b1f5247bd961293ddb6119c966e45de2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76cf927b1f5247bd961293ddb6119c966e45de2f/0_0_2318_1391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philippe Chauvin speaks at the Paris Descartes University.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philippe Chauvin speaks at the Paris Descartes University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: D Opoczynski/D Opoczynski/Maxppp/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He would like to establish whether the French Rugby Federation or anyone else involved on the day was negligent in any way. \u201cA federation has an obligation to ensure the safety of its practitioners. I do not believe that a shoulder shot to the head launched at 20 km/h preserves safety. I just want someone to explain to me why the security of a player could not be assured and if and where mistakes were made.\u201d</p> <p>Calm and measured, Chauvin could just be the catalyst for significant change, with four young players having died in French rugby between May 2018 and January this year. The upper age limit for players representing the Espoirs has already been reduced by a year to 22, aiming to reduce the \u2018men against boys\u2019 element when young junior-club hopefuls like Nicolas start colliding with intensively conditioned professionals. Below-the-waist-only tackles and a ban on double tackles are being tried out at junior level, albeit with mixed initial results.</p> <p>The Chauvin family, though, believe it is people\u2019s attitudes that most need recalibrating. \u201cRugby is not a game of destruction, we must not play to wipe out an opponent. The spirit of the game is to keep the ball alive, not to kill your opposite number.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/21/rugby-union-french-lower-tackle-height-players-deaths\">French rugby authorities call for lower tackle height after players\u2019 deaths</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Philippe instinctively remains a rugby man \u2013 \u201cI used to watch the games with Nicolas. It\u2019s part of our life. I do not wish to attack rugby\u201d \u2013 he does not want other parents to suffer as he and his wife have done.</p> <p>In particular, he argues the sport cannot continue to permit the type of fierce upper-body shot that fractured Nicolas\u2019s second vertebra \u2013 an injury more consistent with car crash victims. \u201cWe must stop looking for excuses when an offence is committed. Rugby is a beautiful sport in terms of its values and shared commitment but if the game is not controlled and safety is not assured, young people will go to another sport. It should not be a sport for bullies or brutes but a sport of possibilities, in which teams have to combine strength, speed, agility, intelligence and will.\u201d</p> <p>The past 10 months have also shown him and his two other rugby-playing sons \u2013 the eldest is 20 \u2013 that not everyone takes full responsibility for their actions. \u201cI have discovered that some within the sport are not prepared to face the reality of fatal accidents.

      "bodyText": "At first glance they could be any French family: a father and his 17-year-old son sitting together in their living room watching the Rugby World Cup on television. So far their favourite match has been Japan\u2019s gripping win over Ireland, not least for the Brave Blossoms\u2019 esprit de corps and positivity. If Philippe Chauvin\u2019s middle son, Nicolas, had still been alive they felt he would have loved it, too. It is almost 10 months now since Nicolas, aged 18, died while playing for Stade Fran\u00e7ais Espoirs against their counterparts from Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles. Rugby was his passion from the moment he first picked up a ball at his local club just east of Paris in 2005. Tragically, the young flanker\u2019s choice of sport cost him his life. A double tackle fractured a cervical vertebra and he subsequently suffered a heart attack and brain damage. He underwent emergency surgery but died three days later. Not everyone, in the wake of such a grievous loss, would have the emotional resilience to tune into this World Cup. Philippe Chauvin, however, is a remarkable \u2013 and increasingly driven \u2013 man. Having played rugby himself for 25 years, he wants Nicolas\u2019s death to galvanise the game\u2019s authorities, in France and worldwide. At the end of last month he announced his intention to launch a manslaughter lawsuit aimed at uncovering the full facts behind his son\u2019s death. Chauvin, who works for the French national rail company SNCF, feels he owes it to Nicolas to check out every available avenue. Under French law, with the police investigation now closed, he is not allowed access to the file relating to his son\u2019s death unless he goes down the legal route. \u201cLosing a child is terrible, even more so because of a problem that could have been avoided. I\u2019m going ahead with this complaint because I do not want it to happen to others. \u201cI feel it is also my duty to Nicolas to do everything so that the facts and responsibilities are established. By filing a complaint, I will have access to the file. There may be things that I do not know or positions that are not the ones I was told.\u201d He would like to establish whether the French Rugby Federation or anyone else involved on the day was negligent in any way. \u201cA federation has an obligation to ensure the safety of its practitioners. I do not believe that a shoulder shot to the head launched at 20 km/h preserves safety. I just want someone to explain to me why the security of a player could not be assured and if and where mistakes were made.\u201d Calm and measured, Chauvin could just be the catalyst for significant change, with four young players having died in French rugby between May 2018 and January this year. The upper age limit for players representing the Espoirs has already been reduced by a year to 22, aiming to reduce the \u2018men against boys\u2019 element when young junior-club hopefuls like Nicolas start colliding with intensively conditioned professionals. Below-the-waist-only tackles and a ban on double tackles are being tried out at junior level, albeit with mixed initial results. The Chauvin family, though, believe it is people\u2019s attitudes that most need recalibrating. \u201cRugby is not a game of destruction, we must not play to wipe out an opponent. The spirit of the game is to keep the ball alive, not to kill your opposite number.\u201d While Philippe instinctively remains a rugby man \u2013 \u201cI used to watch the games with Nicolas. It\u2019s part of our life. I do not wish to attack rugby\u201d \u2013 he does not want other parents to suffer as he and his wife have done. In particular, he argues the sport cannot continue to permit the type of fierce upper-body shot that fractured Nicolas\u2019s second vertebra \u2013 an injury more consistent with car crash victims. \u201cWe must stop looking for excuses when an offence is committed. Rugby is a beautiful sport in terms of its values and shared commitment but if the game is not controlled and safety is not assured, young people will go to another sport. It should not be a sport for bullies or brutes but a sport of possibilities, in which teams have to combine strength, speed, agility, intelligence and will.\u201d The past 10 months have also shown him and his two other rugby-playing sons \u2013 the eldest is 20 \u2013 that not everyone takes full responsibility for their actions. \u201cI have discovered that some within the sport are not prepared to face the reality of fatal accidents. I was very surprised given it is a professional sport. In business a fatal accident is the responsibility of the employer and investigations are conducted to establish the circumstances. The facts are examined against clear safety rules. I feel more apprehension for the players now and am much less tolerant of reckless play. I now know it can be fatal, that there is no second chance if the limits are crossed.\u201d There are few things more affecting than a grieving parent\u2019s cry from the heart. Philippe Chauvin is looking forward to France\u2019s game against England on Saturday but his dearest wish is that Nicolas\u2019s story resonates far beyond this World Cup. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to leave a legacy, he just deserves the people of rugby to be aware of the truth.\u201d The entire rugby world should heed his powerful message.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian man Jock Palfreeman could face another two months behind bars before he finds out if he will be freed, after Bulgaria\u2019s highest court adjourned a hearing about whether to overturn his parole. The 32-year-old Sydney man was found guilty of murder over the 2007 stabbing death of a 23-year-old student, Andrei Monov, in Sofia. Two weeks ago, Palfreeman was granted parole on appeal, a decision that sparked outrage from some in Bulgaria, including the dead man\u2019s father and rightwing nationalist political parties. Palfreeman couldn\u2019t be removed from the country immediately because he didn\u2019t have a passport. The furore over his parole prompted Bulgaria\u2019s prosecutor general to make an extraordinary petition to the court to revoke Palfreeman\u2019s release. On Monday, the supreme court of cassation heard from the prosecution and from Palfreeman\u2019s lawyer. Palfreeman did not appear, according to local media reports. The three-judge bench has two months to hand down its decision on Palfreeman\u2019s liberty. He is being held in an immigration detention centre near Sofia while he awaits the outcome.

Do they try and win back voters who swung from Obama to Trump by opting for a \u201csafe\u201d candidate in Joe Biden? Or do they look for another path to victory by mobilising those who stayed away in 2016, by giving them something to vote for with a candidate pushing more radical policies?</p> \n<p>\u201cSome think that the party needs to move more to the left. I\u2019m not so sure that works around here,\u201d said LeVoy. \u201cI\u2019m a moderate and I\u2019m actually the last Democrat to win around here for the state house. I lean more towards Joe Biden.\u201d</p> \n<p>A party activist, Christopher Slat, interrupted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56105dd86ba5c5c96366cae29e4519ae7521d20a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56105dd86ba5c5c96366cae29e4519ae7521d20a/517_583_2507_3449/727.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Slat, a Democratic party activist in Monroe county, Michigan, backs Bernie Sanders.\" width=\"727\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Slat, a Democratic party activist in Monroe county, Michigan, backs Bernie Sanders.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGrath</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to not run to the left and that hasn\u2019t worked, so why don\u2019t we try something different?\u201d said Slat, a 30-year-old who makes videos for the local school district.</p> \n<p>Slat suspects Trump voters aren\u2019t coming back no matter who the Democratic candidate is. \u201cWe ran Anybody But Trump last time and she didn\u2019t win. We might run Biden and he\u2019s the same thing,\u201d said Slat.</p> \n<p>Nothing stays still with Trump for long, and impeachment has now swung into view. It\u2019s a seismic political drama in Washington and dominates the analysis and argument of cable news. But it has yet to have the same impact in America\u2019s heartland. Perhaps it will in time if the revelations are shocking enough or Trump\u2019s political allies begin to turn on him. For now, Trump\u2019s core voters mostly seem to chalking the investigation up to another Russia-style \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d.</p> \n<p>Slat, who backs Sanders over Biden, said the real impact may not be on Trump at all. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change people\u2019s minds that much, especially if they\u2019re already loyal to Trump. People are going to be more concerned with \u2018what are the candidates going to do for me?\u2019 instead of worrying about this drama stuff. I think there\u2019s a sentiment even among some progressives that all presidents do this kind of stuff. This is a hit job, just another Russia investigation,\u201d he said at the weekend.</p> \n<p>\u201cI do think it\u2019s bad news for Joe Biden. I think it\u2019s going to be a really hard sell if the impeachment is going on through the election cycle for Joe Biden to make the case if his son was taking $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian gas company while he was vice-president, and he\u2019s saying there\u2019s nothing illegal about that. Even if that\u2019s true, it\u2019s going to put him in the same bucket as Hillary where people say they\u2019re all crooks so I\u2019m going to stay home.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Job market shifts</h2> \n<p>Monroe county, like Detroit, was once strong union territory. In 2008, the Ford car plant closed with the loss of 3,200 jobs just as the recession hit.</p> \n<p>\u201cThink about 3,200 people,\u201d said Michael Keck, who worked at the Ford factory for 33 years and is a United Auto Workers (UAW) official. \u201cProbably 2,000 or more of them living in this community, spending money in this community. Gone. Some of them may still live here but they work in Dearborn or Flat Rock. So that\u2019s where they spend their money. The impact was huge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Industries have come and gone from Monroe before. More than a dozen paper mills that once employed thousands making corrugated cardboard boxes were mostly closed by the 1970s. Some of the workers found jobs at the new Ford plant, which became Monroe\u2019s largest employer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f451b39b9d6b7f8289cfdf666ec6eb2c781b2b2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f451b39b9d6b7f8289cfdf666ec6eb2c781b2b2/0_348_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Keck, who worked at the Ford factory, where 3,200 jobs were lost when the factory closed in 2008, for 33 years and is a United Auto Workers (UAW) official.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Keck, who worked at the Ford factory, where 3,200 jobs were lost when the factory closed in 2008, for 33 years and is a United Auto Workers (UAW) official.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGreal/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When that went too, just as the national recession hit, home foreclosures surged. Some people walked away from their houses. Others were locked out by the banks.</p> \n<p>Monroe struggled as shops went to the wall. The local mall is a shell of its once bustling self after major stores such as Sears and Target abandoned it.</p> \n<p>Some industrial jobs remain in steel and at a nuclear power plant. But those forced to find work elsewhere in the county frequently took cuts in pay as they shifted to non-unionised jobs in healthcare, which, like many other struggling parts of the midwest, provides an increasing proportion of employment.</p> \n<p>With the national economic shock of the recession and the local impact of the Ford closure, the majority white county began its shift away from longstanding support for the Democrats by electing Republicans to local and state offices even if voters also backed Obama. In those circumstances, the move from Obama to Trump does not look quite so jarring.</p> \n<p>Keck, who worked in the Ford factory, thinks it was at least in part an act of desperation by those disappointed that Obama did not make the dramatic changes his historic election promised.</p> \n<p>To some, Obama seemed more interested in looking after the banks more than unemployed workers struggling to pay their mortgages. Clinton represented more of the same in 2016.</p> \n<p>The UAW ordered Keck to campaign for her even though he was at heart a Bernie Sanders supporter. Three years later he remains bitter at what he regards as Clinton\u2019s out-of-touch campaign.</p> \n<p>Against that, Trump appeared to be listening to people in Monroe county.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dfba7c9118d94526c59ee8a8c3c343412278c12b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfba7c9118d94526c59ee8a8c3c343412278c12b/186_0_2492_3024/824.jpg\" alt=\"Construction boss Misty Kendall.\" width=\"824\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Construction boss Misty Kendall.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGrath</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The anger that burst out at the ballot box in 2016 has only escalated.

      "bodyText": "Misty Kendall stopped by the Democratic party\u2019s tent at the Monroe county fair in southern Michigan to let them know she wouldn\u2019t be back. The construction company owner voted for Barack Obama twice. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t perfect but I liked his healthcare policy at the time. That was very important to me and I thought it would be good,\u201d she said. But Kendall was deeply disappointed by Obama\u2019s healthcare reforms, blaming them for a surge in her insurance premiums. Even so, she voted for him again when he ran for reelection. \u201cI liked his foreign policies. The way that he was dealing with Al-Qaeda. I thought he was doing a really good job of dealing with terrorism, keeping the country safe,\u201d she said. Then came 2016. Kendall said her vote for Donald Trump was more a rejection of Hillary Clinton, who she regards as dishonest. Now she is a fan of the president and deeply defensive of her vote for him. \u201cPeople say Trump is horrible. He probably is a horrible person. \u201cBut right now I am about the economy. It\u2019s helping me and my family. I\u2019ll be voting for Trump again,\u201d she told incredulous Democratic activists at the county fair. Her company employs 12 people renovating buildings in Detroit, about 25 miles north of Monroe county, which is a 90% white and mostly working-class county of about 150,000 people. Its main city, also called Monroe, has a population of around 20,000 and much of the county\u2019s industry. Kendall\u2019s vote contributed to one of the largest swings across the US from Obama to Trump. America\u2019s first black president won Monroe county, twice, albeit by a slim margin in 2012. Four years later, Trump trounced Clinton in the county, winning 58% of the vote, the largest proportion there since Ronald Reagan in 1984. That delivered Trump\u2019s slim victory in Michigan, which was crucial to putting him in the White House. Trump won the state by just 10,704 votes, the narrowest margin of victory in the history of presidential elections in Michigan. The flipping of counties from Obama to Trump in the Midwest \u2013 and the apparent paradox of Americans shifting from Obama to a man denounced as a misogynist, racist and bully \u2013 was instrumental in the president\u2019s victory. On the other side of Lake Michigan, the shift was decisive in squeezing out a victory for Trump in Wisconsin by less than 23,000 votes or 0.77% of the ballot \u2013 overturning a 213,000 vote victory for Obama in the state four years earlier. Winning a clutch of swing counties turned Iowa and Ohio too. This week, and at various stages in the run up to the 2020 presidential election, the Guardian is reporting from three midwest counties that swung from Obama to Trump in crucial states. On the face of it, Trump\u2019s slim margins of victory in 2016 key states are good reason for the Democrats to believe they can snatch them back from a president perpetually mired in controversy from his incessant tweeting and lashing out at even the mildest criticism to the launch of impeachment hearings. And yet the Democrats would be wise not to count on Monroe county \u2013 which almost always votes for the ultimate presidential winner \u2013 to deliver victory for them, and local party activists know it. The Trump tide \u201cThe Trump tide came in and still hasn\u2019t receded yet,\u201d said Bill LaVoy, who lost his seat as a Democratic state representative for the county in the Trump surge of 2016. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if these are permanent Republican voters now or it\u2019s just temporary,\u201d said LaVoy, also speaking at the Monroe county fair, which dates back to the 19th century. Democrats in Monroe county face the same dilemma as their party nationally. Do they try and win back voters who swung from Obama to Trump by opting for a \u201csafe\u201d candidate in Joe Biden? Or do they look for another path to victory by mobilising those who stayed away in 2016, by giving them something to vote for with a candidate pushing more radical policies? \u201cSome think that the party needs to move more to the left. I\u2019m not so sure that works around here,\u201d said LeVoy. \u201cI\u2019m a moderate and I\u2019m actually the last Democrat to win around here for the state house. I lean more towards Joe Biden.\u201d A party activist, Christopher Slat, interrupted. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to not run to the left and that hasn\u2019t worked, so why don\u2019t we try something different?\u201d said Slat, a 30-year-old who makes videos for the local school district. Slat suspects Trump voters aren\u2019t coming back no matter who the Democratic candidate is. \u201cWe ran Anybody But Trump last time and she didn\u2019t win. We might run Biden and he\u2019s the same thing,\u201d said Slat. Nothing stays still with Trump for long, and impeachment has now swung into view. It\u2019s a seismic political drama in Washington and dominates the analysis and argument of cable news. But it has yet to have the same impact in America\u2019s heartland. Perhaps it will in time if the revelations are shocking enough or Trump\u2019s political allies begin to turn on him. For now, Trump\u2019s core voters mostly seem to chalking the investigation up to another Russia-style \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. Slat, who backs Sanders over Biden, said the real impact may not be on Trump at all. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change people\u2019s minds that much, especially if they\u2019re already loyal to Trump. People are going to be more concerned with \u2018what are the candidates going to do for me?\u2019 instead of worrying about this drama stuff. I think there\u2019s a sentiment even among some progressives that all presidents do this kind of stuff. This is a hit job, just another Russia investigation,\u201d he said at the weekend. \u201cI do think it\u2019s bad news for Joe Biden. I think it\u2019s going to be a really hard sell if the impeachment is going on through the election cycle for Joe Biden to make the case if his son was taking $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian gas company while he was vice-president, and he\u2019s saying there\u2019s nothing illegal about that. Even if that\u2019s true, it\u2019s going to put him in the same bucket as Hillary where people say they\u2019re all crooks so I\u2019m going to stay home.\u201d Job market shifts Monroe county, like Detroit, was once strong union territory. In 2008, the Ford car plant closed with the loss of 3,200 jobs just as the recession hit. \u201cThink about 3,200 people,\u201d said Michael Keck, who worked at the Ford factory for 33 years and is a United Auto Workers (UAW) official. \u201cProbably 2,000 or more of them living in this community, spending money in this community. Gone. Some of them may still live here but they work in Dearborn or Flat Rock. So that\u2019s where they spend their money. The impact was huge.\u201d Industries have come and gone from Monroe before. More than a dozen paper mills that once employed thousands making corrugated cardboard boxes were mostly closed by the 1970s. Some of the workers found jobs at the new Ford plant, which became Monroe\u2019s largest employer. When that went too, just as the national recession hit, home foreclosures surged. Some people walked away from their houses. Others were locked out by the banks. Monroe struggled as shops went to the wall. The local mall is a shell of its once bustling self after major stores such as Sears and Target abandoned it. Some industrial jobs remain in steel and at a nuclear power plant. But those forced to find work elsewhere in the county frequently took cuts in pay as they shifted to non-unionised jobs in healthcare, which, like many other struggling parts of the midwest, provides an increasing proportion of employment. With the national economic shock of the recession and the local impact of the Ford closure, the majority white county began its shift away from longstanding support for the Democrats by electing Republicans to local and state offices even if voters also backed Obama. In those circumstances, the move from Obama to Trump does not look quite so jarring. Keck, who worked in the Ford factory, thinks it was at least in part an act of desperation by those disappointed that Obama did not make the dramatic changes his historic election promised. To some, Obama seemed more interested in looking after the banks more than unemployed workers struggling to pay their mortgages. Clinton represented more of the same in 2016. The UAW ordered Keck to campaign for her even though he was at heart a Bernie Sanders supporter. Three years later he remains bitter at what he regards as Clinton\u2019s out-of-touch campaign. Against that, Trump appeared to be listening to people in Monroe county. The anger that burst out at the ballot box in 2016 has only escalated. Some of it comes from Trump supporters horrified at what he has become. Then there are those such as construction boss Misty Kendall, who voted for Trump less as a statement of support than in opposition to Clinton and who now regard criticism of the president as a personal attack on them. That has helped solidify support for the president among those prepared to set aside his sins, personal and political. A few will defend his tweets and diminishing the dignity of his office as evidence that he is standing up to the elites and telling it like it is. Kendall is prepared to acknowledge criticism of Trump\u2019s language, calling him \u201ckind of crass\u201d. But she regards much of what exercises the president\u2019s critics, from migrant detentions to his climate policies, as faux concerns fabricated as a means to attack him. \u201cEverybody gets so offended if you\u2019re a Trump supporter,\u201d said Kendall. \u201cI just wish that everybody had a more open mind about the situation. We don\u2019t all have to agree. I think he\u2019s a great president. He\u2019s my president. If a Democrat gets elected, guess what? It\u2019s still my president. I might not like it but I have to abide by it because I\u2019m an American.\u201d Healthcare: a huge issue On the other side, anger at Clinton on the Democratic party\u2019s left in 2016, which led some voters to stay away, has turned on Trump and fuelled a surge in activism and engagement with the primaries. The challenge for the party in places such as Monroe county is to find the crossover issues to lure at least some Trump voters back and get wavering voters to the polls. For some, the best issue may be the one which proved most damaging to Obama among many voters \u2013 healthcare reform. \u201cPeople were not happy with Obamacare around here when it raised the cost. This isn\u2019t a wealthy area,\u201d said LaVoy, the former Democratic state representative. \u201cBut health care needs to be fixed. That\u2019s something Trump ran on and he didn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s an opportunity.\u201d Jeff Morris, the president of the local UAW branch, who has worked for 29 years at the Gerdau steel mill in Monroe, said it is the primary political issue for most of his members. \u201cHealthcare for my 500 members is huge. They ask if a candidate is gonna fix healthcare. That\u2019s the whole nine yards,\u201d he said. The challenge for the Democratic party in counties such as Monroe is to present a policy such as healthcare reform that can win back some working class voters and mobilise the young without scaring off other voters with charges of socialism or government overreach. \u2018Now we\u2019re scared\u2019 Part of the challenge is to keep the political debate focused on policies such as healthcare as the president works to get Americans to look elsewhere. \u201cIn the 80s, when I was growing up, it was always abortion and guns,\u201d said Morris. \u201cThere\u2019s a version of that going on right now with immigration.

      "bodyText": "Only one of the officers referred to the police watchdog for questioning over Scotland Yard\u2019s disastrous investigation of a bogus establishment paedophile ring was interviewed face-to-face, the Guardian has learned. The controversial report from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) into Operation Midland, the \u00a32.5m Metropolitan police inquiry that fell for the false claims of the fantasist Carl Beech, is being released on Monday. It will detail why no officer should face any action, saying officers acted \u201cconscientiously\u201d and honestly even when they blundered, the Guardian understands. Falsely accused victims of the 2014-16 investigation are expected to condemn the report. A report by retired judge Sir Richard Henriques called for the officers to face investigation because a district judge was misled by police seeking warrants to raid and search the homes of suspects. After Henriques made his findings in October 2016, five officers were referred to the IOPC for possible investigation. Two were exonerated by the IOPC at the first stage, including the former deputy assistant commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who oversaw the latter stages of Operation Midland. Three detectives faced investigations, of whom two declined to answer oral questions and attend face-to-face interviews with IOPC investigators. The watchdog said it did not have the power to compel them to do so because they were retired at that point, so it accepted written answers. The third detective was interviewed face to face. Beech was jailed for 18 years in July for fabricating allegations about a murderous VIP paedophile ring in Westminster. Those whose homes were searched by police on the basis of his lies included the former military chief Lord Bramall, former home secretary Leon Brittan and former Tory MP Harvey Proctor. Mark Stephens, a solicitor acting for Proctor, said: \u201cIt is fundamentally misleading for the police to say they cooperated when only one officer cooperated by answering questions. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental flaw in the IOPC inquiry for officers to decide they won\u2019t answer questions.\u201d The Henriques report was initially only released heavily redacted. A fuller version of it released on Friday said the issue of police allegedly misleading a judge to gain search warrants as they investigated prominent figures was the most serious police error of the 43 he identified during his inquiry. Police omitted to tell the court of inconsistencies in the account of the sole witness they were basing their investigation on. Henriques, who produced his own damning report into Operation Midland, chose not to wait for the IOPC report to be made public and condemned the police watchdog\u2019s findings. Writing in the Daily Mail, Henriques claimed the IOPC investigator who conducted the case lacked legal training: \u201cShe informed me she had no legal training, was not fully aware of the process for obtaining warrants.\u201d The retired judge added: \u201cThe investigative process itself was minimal, unprofessional and the decision-making was flawed.\u201d The IOPC hit back at Henriques on Monday. A spokesperson said: \u201cAs Sir Richard writes \u2018no subject should be tried without proper investigation\u2019. And, as he acknowledges in his own review, the IOPC is the right and correct authority to do this. Our investigation was both independent and impartial. \u201c The IOPC investigation is understood to conclude that errors made were not deliberate and that it would need evidence that officers had \u201cwilfully\u201d misled a district judge to get search warrants to support criminal prosecutions or disciplinary action. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has met the IOPC director general to discuss how and why the police watchdog reached its finding that no officer should face disciplinary action, let alone criminal action. In a statement the IOPC said: \u201cOf the three subject officers concerned two provided written statements, while the third was interviewed. The two who provided written statements had retired prior to our investigation beginning and under the relevant legislation could not be compelled to attend an interview.\u201d",

Signed for \u00a310m from Porto, Boly would go for at least double that amount, although his current employers might not be inclined to sell as a like-for-like replacement would be extremely unlikely to come as cheap.",

And a departure from the jinking winger he was in Europe, as liable to frustrate as to thrill, where his side hustle was a <a href=\"http://thediamondstudio.blogspot.com/2010/11/damarcus-beasley-launches-jewellery.html\">diamond jewellery collection.</a></p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve talked about with my business partner. Seriously, it has been. Make a few new pieces, kind of reinvent the line,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I want to stay in football.\u201d</p> <p>That could mean following his passion for youth development by opening a training centre in Houston, perhaps similar to the Beasley National Soccer School in his native Fort Wayne, Indiana. Or an as-yet-undefined role with the Dynamo: \u201cWe have reached out to each other to see if there\u2019s any possibility that we can work together in the future at some point,\u201d he hedged.</p> <p>His lack of interest in the limelight, as well as his career trajectory, may also explain why he has not transcended his sport into household name status. Beasley never measured his worth in newsprint or television appearances and never cared about outside praise or criticism.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone has their own opinion. There\u2019s people in the world that think Messi\u2019s not a good player. How in the hell is that possible? But there are people like that. Huh? He\u2019s the best player on the planet. So that stuff does not bother me at all,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cEven when I was in Germany, I didn\u2019t play [but] I was on the national team, I always had confidence in myself. I never let that go. People said \u2018oh, he\u2019s done, what\u2019s he going to do, blah blah blah\u2019. I didn\u2019t go to the media, I didn\u2019t say anything, I didn\u2019t care what people said about me.\u201d</p> <p>Turns out, pace took him to the top but stamina kept him there. And Beasley proved exceptional not only in his durability, but his resilience. \u201cIf they say that I\u2019ve done this or done that\u2026 it doesn\u2019t bother me either way,\u201d he said. \u201cMe, I play for the people that\u2019s in [the locker room], I play for my family, the fans, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019ll have to get used to describing his playing career in the past tense. But it\u2019s easy to believe he is smart and adaptable enough to make a success of life off the pitch. \u201cI\u2019m excited for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m intrigued about what the next chapter is for me.\u201d</p>",

He was still capable of conjuring the unexpected \u2013 this goal from February, say, or a prank on his teammates last week that involved a truck, an image from an infamous New York Times 2002 World Cup \u201cfashion\u201d photoshoot and 110 bags of styrofoam peanuts. But longevity and consistency made him appear predictable and safe \u2260 a stark contrast from his early years as a kid dubbed \u201cJitterbug\u201d for his kinetic attacking. And a departure from the jinking winger he was in Europe, as liable to frustrate as to thrill, where his side hustle was a diamond jewellery collection. \u201cThat\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve talked about with my business partner. Seriously, it has been. Make a few new pieces, kind of reinvent the line,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I want to stay in football.\u201d That could mean following his passion for youth development by opening a training centre in Houston, perhaps similar to the Beasley National Soccer School in his native Fort Wayne, Indiana. Or an as-yet-undefined role with the Dynamo: \u201cWe have reached out to each other to see if there\u2019s any possibility that we can work together in the future at some point,\u201d he hedged. His lack of interest in the limelight, as well as his career trajectory, may also explain why he has not transcended his sport into household name status. Beasley never measured his worth in newsprint or television appearances and never cared about outside praise or criticism. \u201cEveryone has their own opinion. There\u2019s people in the world that think Messi\u2019s not a good player. How in the hell is that possible? But there are people like that. Huh? He\u2019s the best player on the planet. So that stuff does not bother me at all,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when I was in Germany, I didn\u2019t play [but] I was on the national team, I always had confidence in myself. I never let that go. People said \u2018oh, he\u2019s done, what\u2019s he going to do, blah blah blah\u2019. I didn\u2019t go to the media, I didn\u2019t say anything, I didn\u2019t care what people said about me.\u201d Turns out, pace took him to the top but stamina kept him there. And Beasley proved exceptional not only in his durability, but his resilience. \u201cIf they say that I\u2019ve done this or done that\u2026 it doesn\u2019t bother me either way,\u201d he said. \u201cMe, I play for the people that\u2019s in [the locker room], I play for my family, the fans, that\u2019s it.\u201d He\u2019ll have to get used to describing his playing career in the past tense. But it\u2019s easy to believe he is smart and adaptable enough to make a success of life off the pitch. \u201cI\u2019m excited for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m intrigued about what the next chapter is for me.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>At the beginning of <em>Afternoons With </em><em>the </em><em>Blinds Drawn</em>, his second memoir, Brett Anderson admits that it is \u201cthe book I said I wouldn\u2019t write\u2026 about the things I said I didn\u2019t want to talk about\u201d. His plan had been to write just one book, about growing up in Haywards Heath, and to end it at the point that his band, Suede, were poised to become successful. That one book was last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/25/brett-anderson-suede-coal-black-mornings-extract\" title=\"\"><em>Coal Black Mornings</em></a>, an honest and lyrical account that brilliantly described his eccentric, thwarted parents as well as his young self and bandmates. At the time, Anderson told me in an <em>Observer</em> interview that he wrote that story partly for his son, partly for his (now deceased) mum and dad, and partly because he was the only one who could tell it. <em>Coal Black Mornings</em> was personal.</p> <p>But it was also successful, and success means a follow-up. Yet Anderson had decided that he didn\u2019t want to write the story of his time in Suede. His reasoning? Others had already told it, in the music press and through several books and films. (There was a fabulous documentary about the band on Sky last year.)</p> <p>Suede were the starting pistols of Britpop \u2013 though the band hated everything about that particular musical \u201cmovement\u201d and kept themselves apart \u2013 and they burned bright for several years and five albums before splitting up in 2003. They reformed in 2010 and have brought out a few <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/24/night-thoughts-kitty-empire-vulnerable-grand\" title=\"\">excellent LPs since</a>, but that\u2019s not the era anyone wants to hear about (yet). What we want to read is, as Anderson puts it, the story of the \u201cjourney from struggle to success and to self-destruction and back again\u201d. (He also says, correctly, that the story of a band is \u201cas preordained as the life cycle of the frog\u201d.) So the singer, a clever, self-conscious and cussed character, has agreed to write about that journey \u2013 but in his own way. In <em>Afternoons</em>\u2026 he\u2019s aiming for a different kind of rock history: one that digs beneath the usual tales of excess, success and eventual split to reveal something more interesting. He wants \u201cto uncover some sort of truth about the machinery that whirs away, often unseen\u2026\u201d.</p> <p>So what\u2019s whirring away in <em>Afternoons</em>? Well, partly the cogs and chains of the 1990s music industry. But we are in the UK, not the US: the industry is small and personal and everyone knows one another. You can tell the people Anderson doesn\u2019t like or forgive: he refuses to use their names. The group\u2019s PRs, who get the band on 19 front covers before their debut album is released, are never discussed other than in an aside about how Suede \u201cweren\u2019t advised well\u201d; and Anderson manages to be withering about Blur without mentioning the name of a single member of the band. \u201cGroups of witless, opportunistic mockneys \u2013 middle-class media \u2018geezers\u2019 who had learned to drop their aitches and flatten their vowels \u2026 British life, which I saw as more akin to a Mike Leigh film, was being twisted into a <em>Carry On</em> film.\u201d Ouch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/25/brett-anderson-interview-suede-coal-black-mornings\">Brett Anderson Q&amp;A: \u2018I always wanted to make my own tribe\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More of the whirring is provided by the dynamics of Suede, and Anderson is devastatingly accurate about this.

Butler, the guitar star who provided much of the band\u2019s early drive, was as emotionally tricksy as Anderson (young musicians are rarely easy), and the singer is insightful enough to realise that his gradual pulling away from Butler is perhaps partly because their relationship, towards the end, reminds him subconsciously of his relationship with his father; how Anderson felt \u201clike I had to tiptoe around him very carefully, fearful of reawakening a simmering, bilious persona and plunging us all back into a strange, dark theatre of tension\u201d.</p> <p>Anderson is good at pen portraits: his description of graphic designer and bon vivant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2011/may/29/joydivision-neworder\" title=\"\">Peter Saville</a> made me roar with its accuracy. He\u2019s not quite so precise when it comes to his own addictions (we get no details of which drugs he was taking \u2013 though he lists the paraphernalia and we can guess \u2013 nor how he got himself clean), but his descriptions of lost days and nights are grimly perfect. Anderson, in his lyrics, has always been fantastic at capturing the sleaze of underground city living and he does the same here. There\u2019s a scene where his then girlfriend has a seizure and almost overdoses. He has to revive her and I found myself holding my breath.</p> <p>Anderson likes adjectives and detailed scene-setting; he rarely reports direct speech and doesn\u2019t shy away from emotion. Sometimes, he can be a bit pompous, but this is undercut by his honesty when it comes to his own failings (\u201cI oscillated between morbid self-reflection and vainglorious narcissism\u201d), and he starts many chapters with an anecdote revealing how much Suede were disliked. There\u2019s a really funny part where he decides to experiment with electronic music and dye his hair blond.</p> <p><em>Afternoons</em>, in the end, is just as personal as <em>Coal Black Mornings</em>. Anderson\u2019s writing is as he is in real life: sharp, unsparing and sensitive. He understands, fully, from his own experience, how being in a rock band comes down to relationships \u2013 with the media, with fans, with drugs, success, music and, especially, with other members. This is his particular story about his particular band, but it\u2019s not a solo project. It\u2019s about how he felt about and dealt with everyone else around him, and how the consequences changed his life.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Afternoons With the Blinds Drawn </em>by Brett Anderson is published by Little, Brown (\u00a318.99).

Any transition from Kurdish to Turkish control is unlikely to be smooth.</p> <p>\u201cPeople in the camps fear there will be another war, there will be resistance [to a Turkish invasion] and more conflict. They are sitting behind fences \u2026 caught in a very unstable region. People are concerned about the transition to power.\u201d</p> <p>Dabboussy said other countries with citizens caught in the post-war camps had successfully repatriated their citizens.</p> <p>\u201cThe Middle East is a very unstable place, and when you have a window of stability you need to use it. The status quo was stable, and it was not difficult to foresee a destabilising impact of some sort. I would suggest it\u2019s a lost opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>Child rights and welfare NGO Save the Children is operating in the Syrian camps.</p> <p>\u201cThere was always a limited window of opportunity for the Australian government to accept assistance from the United States in order to repatriate the Australian children and women languishing in camps in northeast Syria,\u201d Save the Children Australia chief executive Paul Ronalds said.</p> <p>\u201cWith the news that the US will withdraw its forces that window is rapidly closing. We urge the Australian government to urgently move the Australian children and women in the camps to safety, with a view to repatriating them.\u201d</p> <p>Ronalds said the movement of women and children from the camps to safety must be \u201can immediate priority\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere are more than 40 Australian children in the camps \u2013 most under the age of five \u2013 who have lived through conflict, bombardment and acute deprivation.

      "bodyText": "Family members of Australians held in detention camps in northern Syria have begged the Australian government to \u201cact urgently\u201d to bring their relatives to safety, as a US withdrawal from the region overtly greenlights a Turkish military offensive. Kamalle Dabboussy, whose daughter Mariam and three grandchildren are in Al-Hawl camp in north-east Syria, told the Guardian \u201cthe window is rapidly closing\u201d to bring women and children caught in the camps to safety. \u201cWe\u2019ve been warning the government for months that the window to act is closing. There is still a chance to move these women and children to safety, but the future is uncertain. The window will close quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ve already told the government they need to enact their plan for these Australians, and they need to act with a sense of urgency.\u201d But foreign affairs minister Marise Payne said while the Australian government remains concerned for the welfare of Australians held in the Syrian camps, \u201cas we have made clear, we will not put Australian officials, forces or our public in danger so any repatriation will occur only if safe to do so\u201d. Late Sunday night US time, Donald Trump announced the US was moving its forces out of the area, effectively greenlighting a Turkish offensive into northern Syria, and abandoning long-time allies, the Kurds. Turkey will now take custody of captured Isis fighters, their wives and children, the White House said. Dabboussy, whose daughter Mariam was reportedly coerced by a relative into going to Syria, said the feeling on the ground was one of apprehension, not of Turkish control itself, but of a resistance to any Turkish offensive plunging the volatile region back into war. Any transition from Kurdish to Turkish control is unlikely to be smooth. \u201cPeople in the camps fear there will be another war, there will be resistance [to a Turkish invasion] and more conflict. They are sitting behind fences \u2026 caught in a very unstable region. People are concerned about the transition to power.\u201d Dabboussy said other countries with citizens caught in the post-war camps had successfully repatriated their citizens. \u201cThe Middle East is a very unstable place, and when you have a window of stability you need to use it. The status quo was stable, and it was not difficult to foresee a destabilising impact of some sort. I would suggest it\u2019s a lost opportunity.\u201d Child rights and welfare NGO Save the Children is operating in the Syrian camps. \u201cThere was always a limited window of opportunity for the Australian government to accept assistance from the United States in order to repatriate the Australian children and women languishing in camps in northeast Syria,\u201d Save the Children Australia chief executive Paul Ronalds said. \u201cWith the news that the US will withdraw its forces that window is rapidly closing. We urge the Australian government to urgently move the Australian children and women in the camps to safety, with a view to repatriating them.\u201d Ronalds said the movement of women and children from the camps to safety must be \u201can immediate priority\u201d. \u201cThere are more than 40 Australian children in the camps \u2013 most under the age of five \u2013 who have lived through conflict, bombardment and acute deprivation. These children are innocent victims of the conflict and must be treated as such.\u201d Kurdish forces, supported by the US, have spearheaded the campaign against terror group Isis in the region, but Trump\u2019s dramatically altered policy after a phone conversation with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has left the region deeply uncertain over its future. \u201cThe Kurds have sacrificed an enormous amount in this conflict,\u201d Dabboussy told the Guardian. \u201cTo lose the Kurds as an ally, to betray the Kurds in this way, they may be forced to look for other allies in the region, for instance Iran and Russia. It\u2019s hugely disappointing.\u201d For months Erdo\u011fan has been threatening to launch a military assault on the Kurdish forces in northern Syria. In August, the US and Turkey came to an agreement to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d in the region, by which US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would pull back from the border. Ankara regards the SDF as essentially indistinguishable from Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey and views the organisation as a terrorist front and a serious internal security threat. The safe zone deal was due to forestall a Turkish military offensive. In his White House statement, Trump said he had spoken to Erdo\u011fan by phone, and Turkey would \u201csoon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria\u201d. US forces would not support or be involved in the operation, he said. Bob Carr, a former Labor foreign affairs minister, said Trump\u2019s decision was \u201ca devastating blow to US credibility\u201d not just in the region but across the world, and Australia \u201cought to be a bit more realistic and down to earth\u201d. Speaking on Sky News on Tuesday, Carr predicted Australian defence leaders would be seeking urgent clarification, given Australia\u2019s assistance with advice, training and aerial oversight in the region. There had been a lot of \u201cheady romanticism\u201d about the US alliance but it was clear the US would put its own interests above those of its allies, Carr added. He said other countries that had allied with the US would be wondering \u201cif a US president can make a decision like this and give effect to it within hours \u2026 then how can you count on American guarantees anywhere?\u201d Trump\u2019s statement specifically condemned \u201cFrance, Germany and other European nations\u201d for refusing to take back captured fighters, and said Turkey would now be responsible for those captured foreign fighters and their family members held in camps. \u201cThe United States will not hold them for what could be many years and at great cost to the United States taxpayer,\u201d he said. Payne said the Australian government was in close consultation with allies about Trump\u2019s unilateral decision. \u201cThe Australian government urges restraint by all parties to the conflict in Syria, and calls for all to avoid escalatory actions that cause further instability and added risks of humanitarian suffering.\u201d While not named in the statement, Australia also has more than 60 citizens in the camps, where around 70,000 family members of fighters are being held. During the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s recent US visit, Trump had threatened to leave foreign fighters at the borders of their home countries, but Morrison said the question of Australia\u2019s citizens did not form part of the bilateral talks. While some children of Australian foreign fighters have been brought back to Australia, 66 women and children remain. Morrison maintains the government will not risk any Australian life to bring back adults. \u201cThere are some quite hideous things that are occurring in these camps and there are some pretty hideous people in them who don\u2019t want to do Australia any favours,\u201d he told Sky News last week. \u201cLet\u2019s not assume that the individuals, particularly the adults, who are involved here don\u2019t present any potential threat to Australia. \u201cThat would be a big mistake to make.\u201d On social media, the SDF\u2019s coordination and military operations centre said following the agreement struck with the US, the SDF withdrew military fortifications, combat forces and heavy weapons from the border area. Now the unilateral US withdrawal risked creating a \u201czone of conflict and permanent war\u201d. The SDF said any Turkish attack would reverse the successful effort to defeat Isis, \u201cwhere the SDF sacrificed 11,000 martyrs of our sons and daughters over five years\u201d, draw Isis leaders in hiding back into conflict in north-eastern Syria and create a long-term war in the region, \u201cmaking Syria a permanent conflict area\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>A few weeks ago after watching the Dolphins and then the Jets suffer their latest embarrassing, soulless losses, I posed a question on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thefootballgirl/status/1175849629981691904?s=20\">Twitter</a>: Is it better to be a Dolphins or Jets fan? For a fleeting moment all the misery felt equal, after all, losing is losing, right? But after some thought, some enlightened responses and a little more perspective, it turns out Dolphins fans are living the dream compared to Jets fans and a number of other fanbases that again had to suffer through their team\u2019s hell in Week 5. Most of this year\u2019s crop of bad teams \u2013 including the Jets, Washington, Bengals, Falcons and to an extent the Cardinals and Steelers \u2013 look <em>especially </em>egregious this season. In large part that\u2019s because, unlike the Dolphins, they are losing without purpose or any semblance of remedy.</p> <p>Miami, to their credit have been honest about this lost season. GM Chris Grier already said this year\u2019s Dolphins weren\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.wftv.com/news/florida/dolphins-gm-chris-grier-says-turnaround-can-come-quickly/987387002\">\u201cbuilt to win a Super Bowl.\u201d</a> They gutted their franchise, all while getting to examine whether Josh Rosen is a viable option under center. Next April they will undergo a major rebuild with three first-round draft picks, possibly two in the top 10, and a decent amount of cash to spend in free agency. While that\u2019s not ideal for current veterans at the tail end of their careers, the Dolphins are at least dripping in hope. Just look at the Raiders, who were mocked after undergoing a similar strategy last season. Now they\u2019re 3-2 with a young, exciting team only poised to get better.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/06/nfl-mason-rudolph-knocked-out-steelers-ravens\">NFL wrap: Rudolph knocked out in Steelers loss; Chiefs lose unbeaten record</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile the Jets now sit at 0-4. Sunday\u2019s 31-6 loss to the Eagles was the latest low point under Adam Gase. While Gase cannot be blamed for the absence of their starting quarterback Sam Darnold through illness, he can be blamed for how he has reacted to that loss. On Sunday, the offense was woefully unprepared, including starting quarterback Luke Falk, who Gase oddly decided <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/adam-gase-waited-until-the-last-day-of-practice-to-give-1838824664\">not to have practice with the first team at all last week</a>. The Jets\u2019 offensive line played as if still on a bye, allowing Falk to get sacked NINE times.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll break the huddle and guys were not getting lined up,\u201d running back Le\u2019Veon Bell <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/ny-adam-gase-eagles-20191006-iueyxcxctzeijnwzuf5y3jdm7u-story.html\">told reporters.</a> That\u2019s on Gase.</p> <p>The Bengals, meanwhile, fell to 0-5, losing to the previously winless Cardinals 26-23 in a game that was far more lopsided than the box score suggests. They\u2019ve lost close games like Week 1\u2019s one point loss to the Seahawks and they\u2019ve been blown out. But they lose with a vanilla offense and largely the same cast of characters that Marvin Lewis also lost with before being replaced by Sean McVay\u2019s buddy Zac Taylor. Taylor was flatly outcoached Sunday by the offseason\u2019s most questionable coaching hire, Kliff Kingsbury. It\u2019s strange to group the Falcons with some of these teams given their roster talent, but heck, they\u2019re 1-4 and Dan Quinn is spinning his wheels. Atlanta need a spark and the status quo isn\u2019t it.</p> <p>Then there are the talented players wasting their primes in the directionless pit that is Washington. Head coach (<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27790170/winless-redskins-fire-coach-jay-gruden\">at the time of writing</a>) Jay Gruden has been unable to concoct a viable winning blueprint and, like Gase, seems to be throwing darts when it comes to quarterback. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoraPrinciotti/status/1179426723110281216\">Asked Wednesday</a> about the team\u2019s plans at quarterback for the game against New England, Gruden said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have one right now.\u201d At least he\u2019s honest.</p> <p>Each of these franchises has its own recipe for failure but aside from Arizona none have an acceptable \u201cright now\u201d plan. While temporarily painful, Dolphins fans can stand pat with this season\u2019s crew, perhaps dissecting who will be part of the new and improved 2020 Dolphins. You can\u2019t fairly examine Brian Flores\u2019s worth as a coach this season or grade Grier on his hire and draftees until the process plays out. But there is a process.</p> <p>For the Bengals, Washington, Jets and to an extent the Falcons this season already feels numb, like a strange nothingness that just needs to end. It\u2019s torturous to watch Washington and Falcons collect penalties each week like there\u2019s a prize at the end. It\u2019s infuriating to observe certain QB-starved teams not smart enough to consider checking in with Colin Kaepernick to see if he\u2019s in football-ready shape.</p> <p>Maybe AJ Green will get traded for a first-round pick and somehow it will alter the Bengals\u2019 season or a new coach will light a fire under Washington. But for now, far too many are teams are vying for the NFL\u2019s most hopeless award, and it\u2019s torture to watch. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for the fans.</p> <h2><strong>Stat of the week</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/06/oakland-raiders-chicago-bears-nfl-josh-jacobs-london\">Oakland\u2019s early arrival pays off against Bears and Jacobs profits</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>169 rushing yards for the Oakland Raiders</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/06/oakland-raiders-chicago-bears-nfl-josh-jacobs-london\">Oakland\u2019s stunning 24-21 defeat of the Chicago Bears</a> in London came on the legs of Josh Jacobs and an effective rushing attack unlike any the Bears have seen in some time. Sunday\u2019s contest was billed as showcasing the dominant Bears defensive line and why the Raiders royally mucked up when they traded away Khalil Mack last year. Chicago\u2019s run defense had been immense, allowing 61.5 rushing yards per game and only one rushing touchdown. The Raiders changed that narrative with Jacobs fighting for extra yards and finding open lanes on his way to 123 yards and two scores. DeAndre Washington added another score on the ground. The Raiders are now an impressive 3-2. Given the Bears\u2019 recent history and defensive line depth, Sunday will likely be chalked up an anomaly. Still, it was stunning to see any team have an effective rushing attack against this group.</p> <h2><strong>Co-MVPs of the week</strong></h2> <p><strong>Christian McCaffrey and Deshaun Watson</strong>. McCaffrey continues to be to rushing what Patrick Mahomes is to quarterbacking: a generational talent who is delightful to watch. In a tight game against the feisty Jacksonville Jaguars, McCaffrey was again the difference maker for Carolina, accounting for 237 yards of offense and three touchdowns (including an 84-yard burner). Since Cam Newton was injured three weeks ago, McCaffrey has racked up 604 yards and five touchdowns. The Panthers are 3-0 in that span.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Panthers/status/1180922038506180608\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IT&#39;S A C-MAC ATTACK!!!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/run__cmc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@run__cmc</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/KeepPounding?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#KeepPounding</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ZS5yqksJor\">pic.twitter.com/ZS5yqksJor</a></p>&mdash; Carolina Panthers (@Panthers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Panthers/status/1180922038506180608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Watson absolutely annihilated the Falcons defense in a 53-32 win for the Texans. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFL_quarterbacks_who_have_posted_a_perfect_passer_rating\">Watson\u2019s stat line was literally perfect</a>: 426 passing yards, five touchdowns, no picks and a 158.3 passer rating. One of the only troublesome spots for Watson came on in the first-quarter when the scrambling QB fumbled, then picked up the ball and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNNFL/status/1180898906827350016?s=20\">ran for the first down</a>. It was that kind of day for Watson who is quickly becoming one of the NFL\u2019s great quarterbacks. Atlanta have a confoundingly bad secondary and Watson knew how to take advantage of every opportunity, of which there were many.</p> <h2><strong>Quote of the week</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIf the key works Monday, I\u2019ll keep on working\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1180946751626338304?s=20\">Washington head coach Jay Gruden</a>.</p> <p>Gruden was the preseason favorite to be the first coach shown the door this season. An 0-5 start later, including Sunday\u2019s lopsided 33-7 loss to the Patriots, and Gruden\u2019s days may be numbered. Washington actually jumped to an early 7-0 lead and stymied the Patriots\u2019 offense for much of the first half. The second half was a different as Washington were plagued by miscues, any lack of offensive wizardry and the Patriots waking up. Gruden sounds like he understands his fate after a dismal 21-26-1 record and wouldn\u2019t mind if his key stopped working sooner rather than later.</p> <p>[EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27790170/winless-redskins-fire-coach-jay-gruden\">Gruden was fired on Monday morning</a>]</p> <h2><strong>Video of the week</strong></h2> <p>Unfortunately, this week\u2019s video isn\u2019t a thrilling play.

Meanwhile, a reportedly disenfranchised Stefon Diggs racked up $200,000 in fines for unexcused absences from practices and meetings while teams started inquiring about a trade. Well, Cousins responded with his best performance this season, executing his part in a 28-10 thumping of the New York Giants. Cousins hit Thielen seven times for 130 yards and two scores. Diggs was targeted less often and only caught three passes for 33 yards. Still, he seemed pretty jazzed to participate in one of the NFL\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thefootballgirl/status/1180900228083249152?s=20\">best touchdown celebrations</a> this year. The Giants have a dismal secondary and Diggs winked when declaring he wanted to stay in Minnesota in the postgame so the positivity could be temporary.

But since we have a few months before they hoist the Lombardi Trophy again, there are a few glaring weaknesses exposed for the first half Sunday, namely the offensive line and lack of a physical tight end. Rob Gronkowski was a generational tight end and any team would be lucky to find a player with half of his impact. Many teams are fine without their tight end being an offensive weapon or even a decoy like Gronk was in recent years. But Brady, in particular, needs more security blanket given his notorious inability to scramble. There was a third and goal Sunday and a lane opened wide enough to entice many quarterbacks to scramble. Brady just threw the ball away after seeing his receivers couldn\u2019t break away on their routes. Of course the Patriots have a top-flight defense and running game and the greatest coach in NFL history so a weakness here and there doesn\u2019t quite have the same impact as in other franchises. But any dent in the armor provides some sense of hope to the other 31 fanbases, even if they know that hope is false.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A few weeks ago after watching the Dolphins and then the Jets suffer their latest embarrassing, soulless losses, I posed a question on Twitter: Is it better to be a Dolphins or Jets fan? For a fleeting moment all the misery felt equal, after all, losing is losing, right? But after some thought, some enlightened responses and a little more perspective, it turns out Dolphins fans are living the dream compared to Jets fans and a number of other fanbases that again had to suffer through their team\u2019s hell in Week 5. Most of this year\u2019s crop of bad teams \u2013 including the Jets, Washington, Bengals, Falcons and to an extent the Cardinals and Steelers \u2013 look especially egregious this season. In large part that\u2019s because, unlike the Dolphins, they are losing without purpose or any semblance of remedy. Miami, to their credit have been honest about this lost season. GM Chris Grier already said this year\u2019s Dolphins weren\u2019t \u201cbuilt to win a Super Bowl.\u201d They gutted their franchise, all while getting to examine whether Josh Rosen is a viable option under center. Next April they will undergo a major rebuild with three first-round draft picks, possibly two in the top 10, and a decent amount of cash to spend in free agency. While that\u2019s not ideal for current veterans at the tail end of their careers, the Dolphins are at least dripping in hope. Just look at the Raiders, who were mocked after undergoing a similar strategy last season. Now they\u2019re 3-2 with a young, exciting team only poised to get better. Meanwhile the Jets now sit at 0-4. Sunday\u2019s 31-6 loss to the Eagles was the latest low point under Adam Gase. While Gase cannot be blamed for the absence of their starting quarterback Sam Darnold through illness, he can be blamed for how he has reacted to that loss. On Sunday, the offense was woefully unprepared, including starting quarterback Luke Falk, who Gase oddly decided not to have practice with the first team at all last week. The Jets\u2019 offensive line played as if still on a bye, allowing Falk to get sacked NINE times. \u201cWe\u2019ll break the huddle and guys were not getting lined up,\u201d running back Le\u2019Veon Bell told reporters. That\u2019s on Gase. The Bengals, meanwhile, fell to 0-5, losing to the previously winless Cardinals 26-23 in a game that was far more lopsided than the box score suggests. They\u2019ve lost close games like Week 1\u2019s one point loss to the Seahawks and they\u2019ve been blown out. But they lose with a vanilla offense and largely the same cast of characters that Marvin Lewis also lost with before being replaced by Sean McVay\u2019s buddy Zac Taylor. Taylor was flatly outcoached Sunday by the offseason\u2019s most questionable coaching hire, Kliff Kingsbury. It\u2019s strange to group the Falcons with some of these teams given their roster talent, but heck, they\u2019re 1-4 and Dan Quinn is spinning his wheels. Atlanta need a spark and the status quo isn\u2019t it. Then there are the talented players wasting their primes in the directionless pit that is Washington. Head coach (at the time of writing) Jay Gruden has been unable to concoct a viable winning blueprint and, like Gase, seems to be throwing darts when it comes to quarterback. Asked Wednesday about the team\u2019s plans at quarterback for the game against New England, Gruden said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have one right now.\u201d At least he\u2019s honest. Each of these franchises has its own recipe for failure but aside from Arizona none have an acceptable \u201cright now\u201d plan. While temporarily painful, Dolphins fans can stand pat with this season\u2019s crew, perhaps dissecting who will be part of the new and improved 2020 Dolphins. You can\u2019t fairly examine Brian Flores\u2019s worth as a coach this season or grade Grier on his hire and draftees until the process plays out. But there is a process. For the Bengals, Washington, Jets and to an extent the Falcons this season already feels numb, like a strange nothingness that just needs to end. It\u2019s torturous to watch Washington and Falcons collect penalties each week like there\u2019s a prize at the end. It\u2019s infuriating to observe certain QB-starved teams not smart enough to consider checking in with Colin Kaepernick to see if he\u2019s in football-ready shape. Maybe AJ Green will get traded for a first-round pick and somehow it will alter the Bengals\u2019 season or a new coach will light a fire under Washington. But for now, far too many are teams are vying for the NFL\u2019s most hopeless award, and it\u2019s torture to watch. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for the fans. Stat of the week 169 rushing yards for the Oakland Raiders. Oakland\u2019s stunning 24-21 defeat of the Chicago Bears in London came on the legs of Josh Jacobs and an effective rushing attack unlike any the Bears have seen in some time. Sunday\u2019s contest was billed as showcasing the dominant Bears defensive line and why the Raiders royally mucked up when they traded away Khalil Mack last year. Chicago\u2019s run defense had been immense, allowing 61.5 rushing yards per game and only one rushing touchdown. The Raiders changed that narrative with Jacobs fighting for extra yards and finding open lanes on his way to 123 yards and two scores. DeAndre Washington added another score on the ground. The Raiders are now an impressive 3-2. Given the Bears\u2019 recent history and defensive line depth, Sunday will likely be chalked up an anomaly. Still, it was stunning to see any team have an effective rushing attack against this group. Co-MVPs of the week Christian McCaffrey and Deshaun Watson. McCaffrey continues to be to rushing what Patrick Mahomes is to quarterbacking: a generational talent who is delightful to watch. In a tight game against the feisty Jacksonville Jaguars, McCaffrey was again the difference maker for Carolina, accounting for 237 yards of offense and three touchdowns (including an 84-yard burner). Since Cam Newton was injured three weeks ago, McCaffrey has racked up 604 yards and five touchdowns. The Panthers are 3-0 in that span. Watson absolutely annihilated the Falcons defense in a 53-32 win for the Texans. Watson\u2019s stat line was literally perfect: 426 passing yards, five touchdowns, no picks and a 158.3 passer rating. One of the only troublesome spots for Watson came on in the first-quarter when the scrambling QB fumbled, then picked up the ball and ran for the first down. It was that kind of day for Watson who is quickly becoming one of the NFL\u2019s great quarterbacks. Atlanta have a confoundingly bad secondary and Watson knew how to take advantage of every opportunity, of which there were many. Quote of the week \u201cIf the key works Monday, I\u2019ll keep on working\u201d \u2013 Washington head coach Jay Gruden. Gruden was the preseason favorite to be the first coach shown the door this season. An 0-5 start later, including Sunday\u2019s lopsided 33-7 loss to the Patriots, and Gruden\u2019s days may be numbered. Washington actually jumped to an early 7-0 lead and stymied the Patriots\u2019 offense for much of the first half. The second half was a different as Washington were plagued by miscues, any lack of offensive wizardry and the Patriots waking up. Gruden sounds like he understands his fate after a dismal 21-26-1 record and wouldn\u2019t mind if his key stopped working sooner rather than later. [EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2013 Gruden was fired on Monday morning] Video of the week Unfortunately, this week\u2019s video isn\u2019t a thrilling play. In chilling footage that will not exactly help declining participation rates in youth football, Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph was sandwiched by monster hits from Ravens safety Earl Thomas and corner Brandon Carr. Rudolph crumbled to the ground and lay motionless as teammates frantically waved over medical personnel. It was an emotional few minutes before Rudolph walked off the field. He was immediately ruled out of the game with a concussion. Later on, Broncos cornerback De\u2019Vante Bausby suffered a similar fate and left boarded to a stretcher after colliding with teammate Alexander Johnson in their contest against the Chargers. NFL players are only guaranteed a sliver of their contracts. Dangerous moments like Sunday underscore why we should support players who hold out in a quest to secure every penny possible. This sport was not meant to be played by human beings. Those who risk their present and future every week for our viewing pleasure should be heavily compensated. Elsewhere around the league \u2022 Aaron Rodgers has been good this season, rather than the spectacular player we are used to. But the Green Bay Packers are in a good position because this season Rodgers actually has a supporting case to help him out. On Sunday, it was Aaron Jones who stepped up, scoring four rushing touchdowns. The defense also intercepted Dak Prescott three times, as the Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys and moved to 4-1. \u2022 The Kansas City Chiefs lost their unbeaten record to the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts seem to be doing pretty well after Andrew Luck\u2019s retirement, and their offensive line and defense were superb all night. \u2022 It was a drama-filled week for the Vikings passing unit.

      "body": "<h2>1) Emery searches for balance and clarity</h2> <p>Unai Emery, in his programme notes for the game against Bournemouth, spoke about the importance of balance and how he wants his side to be \u201ccompetitive both defensively and offensively\u201d. That is excellent in theory but it needs to be put into practice and yet again on Sunday there was little evidence of that. Arsenal won but they did not play well and the most glaring issue is the lack of an obvious plan. Are Arsenal meant to press aggressively, and if so why did that part of their game drop off so alarmingly? Are they meant to dominate possession, and if so why do their midfielders appear to spend more time running than playing passes? It is confusing and while injuries are an issue for Emery, particularly in regards to his first\u2011choice full-backs, it is fair to expect that after more than a year in charge his vision for the team would be much clearer. <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/06/arsenal-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Arsenal 1-0 Bournemouth</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2) Potter preys on Tottenham\u2019s twin towers</h2> <p>Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, the Tottenham centre\u2011halves, have looked like creaking 30-somethings of late and Graham Potter set up his Brighton team to exploit their lack of pace. He used a 4-4-2 system, with his defenders squeezed high and the strikers, Aaron Connolly and Neal Maupay, encouraged to play off the shoulders of the Belgian pair. It worked brilliantly, with Brighton finally winning at home and scoring goals. They might have had more, such was their fluency and the ease with which they played through Spurs. It added up to a headache for Mauricio Pochettino \u2013 is it time to recall D\u00e1vinson S\u00e1nchez or even Juan Foyth? \u2013 but Potter could revel in a plan that came together. There was a fine performance off the left from Aaron Mooy and a two-goal full Premier League debut from Connolly. The 19-year-old has now been promoted into the senior Republic of Ireland squad. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/brighton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Brighton 3-0 Tottenham</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"970fa11831ebbd1e1b1d7303198a2928cb972277\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/970fa11831ebbd1e1b1d7303198a2928cb972277/0_0_2700_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Connolly is congratulated during a debut to remember.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Connolly is congratulated during a debut to remember.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Stokes/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Silva looks on borrowed time</h2> <p>Marco Silva claims he received Farhad Moshiri\u2019s full support when they met last week and Everton\u2019s majority shareholder will have had no reason to change tack despite Saturday\u2019s defeat at Burnley. \u201cAll the feedback I had, it all goes this way,\u201d said Silva when asked if Moshiri still craved stability with him as manager. \u201cIf they saw the game, and for sure they saw it, they can analyse and they saw the same things as me. I don\u2019t believe things have changed.\u201d Silva\u2019s assessment of Everton\u2019s performance, however, was wildly upbeat. Everton, with a starting lineup costing more than \u00a3250m, were woeful from start to finish. The clock is ticking on the uninspiring manager of an uninspiring team and given Moshiri\u2019s track record of poor appointments, the director of football, Marcel Brands, should be left with responsibility for finally getting one right. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/burnley-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Burnley 1-0 Everton</a></p> <h2>4) Liverpool surge clear despite spurned chances</h2> <p>A ticket for Anfield seems to come with guaranteed drama at the moment, yet for all the excitement created by Liverpool\u2019s 95th-minute penalty winner and subsequent shenanigans on the pitch, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s post-match analysis was spot-on. \u201cWe were exceptional for an hour, the only problem was that we only scored one goal,\u201d the manager said. The rather prosaic truth is that with better finishing his side would have been out of Leicester\u2019s reach long before the end, with Roberto Firmino, Andy Robertson and Georginio Wijnaldum all failing to put away excellent chances at 1-0. To an extent Liverpool got lucky, though it is also true to say that for all their feistiness Leicester were fortunate to still be in the game. If Klopp\u2019s team are to equal the record of 18 straight wins at Old Trafford in their next game they will hope to be more clinical. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/05/liverpool-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool 2-1 Leicester</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e282a942c5ef5cc9b7db348767ae5d7eb059dfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e282a942c5ef5cc9b7db348767ae5d7eb059dfa/0_66_3240_1944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"J\u00fcrgen Klopp celebrates after Liverpool's last-gasp win.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A big mood from J\u00fcrgen Klopp after the win.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) Manchester City crave De Bruyne\u2019s guile</h2> <p>The international break may have come at the right time for listing Manchester City. When it ends Kevin De Bruyne should be fit and Pep Guardiola\u2019s hope will be the midfielder can unlock defences, which the team could not do on Sunday. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan said: \u201cWolves were very defensive in the last 10, 15 minutes. It was difficult to play. When you are not able to score the first goal, maybe we get nervous and don\u2019t 100% feel the confidence is there and we have to be patient. We know how we can play and our qualities. We could not put that on the pitch.\u201d De Bruyne\u2019s brand of direct, destructive play should return at Crystal Palace on 19 October. But given Liverpool\u2019s eight-point lead is the biggest of the Premier League era at this stage the Belgian has to help ensure the team go on a long run of consecutive wins while hoping J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s slip up too. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/06/manchester-city-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester City 0-2 Wolves</a></p> <h2>6) Manchester United youth not up to the task</h2> <p>Newcastle benefited from a youngster being forced into the limelight when Matty Longstaff scored the winner, whereas Manchester United are not enjoying such a luxury as their newcomers struggle to cope with the rigours and pressure of being at a supposedly elite club.

It was the Belgian striker\u2019s first Premier League goal for Chelsea since October 2017 and reward for his hard work on the training ground in recent weeks. Earlier this season Frank Lampard was critical of Batshuayi\u2019s fitness and those words seem to have struck a chord with the 26-year-old, who has not given up hope of making it work at Chelsea after loans with Borussia Dortmund, Crystal Palace and Valencia. He will have to wait for his chance, of course, as Tammy Abraham is first choice. Abraham\u2019s goal against Southampton, his ninth of the season, was spectacular. But Batshuayi also has something to offer and his confident finish in the dying stages showed he can be a useful option. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/06/southampton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Southampton 1-4 Chelsea</a></p> <h2>9) Pr\u00f6dl coy over departed Gracia</h2> <p>Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl made his first Premier League start for 17 months in Watford\u2019s draw with Sheffield United and before coming off with a minor hamstring injury, he helped to earn his team a first clean sheet in the league this season.

      "bodyText": "1) Emery searches for balance and clarity Unai Emery, in his programme notes for the game against Bournemouth, spoke about the importance of balance and how he wants his side to be \u201ccompetitive both defensively and offensively\u201d. That is excellent in theory but it needs to be put into practice and yet again on Sunday there was little evidence of that. Arsenal won but they did not play well and the most glaring issue is the lack of an obvious plan. Are Arsenal meant to press aggressively, and if so why did that part of their game drop off so alarmingly? Are they meant to dominate possession, and if so why do their midfielders appear to spend more time running than playing passes? It is confusing and while injuries are an issue for Emery, particularly in regards to his first\u2011choice full-backs, it is fair to expect that after more than a year in charge his vision for the team would be much clearer. Sachin Nakrani \u2022 Match report: Arsenal 1-0 Bournemouth 2) Potter preys on Tottenham\u2019s twin towers Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, the Tottenham centre\u2011halves, have looked like creaking 30-somethings of late and Graham Potter set up his Brighton team to exploit their lack of pace. He used a 4-4-2 system, with his defenders squeezed high and the strikers, Aaron Connolly and Neal Maupay, encouraged to play off the shoulders of the Belgian pair. It worked brilliantly, with Brighton finally winning at home and scoring goals. They might have had more, such was their fluency and the ease with which they played through Spurs. It added up to a headache for Mauricio Pochettino \u2013 is it time to recall D\u00e1vinson S\u00e1nchez or even Juan Foyth? \u2013 but Potter could revel in a plan that came together. There was a fine performance off the left from Aaron Mooy and a two-goal full Premier League debut from Connolly. The 19-year-old has now been promoted into the senior Republic of Ireland squad. David Hytner \u2022 Match report: Brighton 3-0 Tottenham 3) Silva looks on borrowed time Marco Silva claims he received Farhad Moshiri\u2019s full support when they met last week and Everton\u2019s majority shareholder will have had no reason to change tack despite Saturday\u2019s defeat at Burnley. \u201cAll the feedback I had, it all goes this way,\u201d said Silva when asked if Moshiri still craved stability with him as manager. \u201cIf they saw the game, and for sure they saw it, they can analyse and they saw the same things as me. I don\u2019t believe things have changed.\u201d Silva\u2019s assessment of Everton\u2019s performance, however, was wildly upbeat. Everton, with a starting lineup costing more than \u00a3250m, were woeful from start to finish. The clock is ticking on the uninspiring manager of an uninspiring team and given Moshiri\u2019s track record of poor appointments, the director of football, Marcel Brands, should be left with responsibility for finally getting one right. Andy Hunter \u2022 Match report: Burnley 1-0 Everton 4) Liverpool surge clear despite spurned chances A ticket for Anfield seems to come with guaranteed drama at the moment, yet for all the excitement created by Liverpool\u2019s 95th-minute penalty winner and subsequent shenanigans on the pitch, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s post-match analysis was spot-on. \u201cWe were exceptional for an hour, the only problem was that we only scored one goal,\u201d the manager said. The rather prosaic truth is that with better finishing his side would have been out of Leicester\u2019s reach long before the end, with Roberto Firmino, Andy Robertson and Georginio Wijnaldum all failing to put away excellent chances at 1-0. To an extent Liverpool got lucky, though it is also true to say that for all their feistiness Leicester were fortunate to still be in the game. If Klopp\u2019s team are to equal the record of 18 straight wins at Old Trafford in their next game they will hope to be more clinical. Paul Wilson \u2022 Match report: Liverpool 2-1 Leicester 5) Manchester City crave De Bruyne\u2019s guile The international break may have come at the right time for listing Manchester City. When it ends Kevin De Bruyne should be fit and Pep Guardiola\u2019s hope will be the midfielder can unlock defences, which the team could not do on Sunday. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan said: \u201cWolves were very defensive in the last 10, 15 minutes. It was difficult to play. When you are not able to score the first goal, maybe we get nervous and don\u2019t 100% feel the confidence is there and we have to be patient. We know how we can play and our qualities. We could not put that on the pitch.\u201d De Bruyne\u2019s brand of direct, destructive play should return at Crystal Palace on 19 October. But given Liverpool\u2019s eight-point lead is the biggest of the Premier League era at this stage the Belgian has to help ensure the team go on a long run of consecutive wins while hoping J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s slip up too. Jamie Jackson \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 0-2 Wolves 6) Manchester United youth not up to the task Newcastle benefited from a youngster being forced into the limelight when Matty Longstaff scored the winner, whereas Manchester United are not enjoying such a luxury as their newcomers struggle to cope with the rigours and pressure of being at a supposedly elite club. It is not that the talent is absent, more too much is being demanded of them while those more senior struggle to set the example required. The academy graduates are not just filling in the gaps at United, instead Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is having to turn them into the team\u2019s spine and as the weeks go by it isproving a flawed concept and the morale of the teenagers will likely quickly drop.

Manson, a broadband engineer from Reading, had been experiencing a stabbing pain in his left nipple for months.

He was right. He had stage four breast cancer that had spread to his lymph nodes. Six years on, following a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Manson\u2019s cancer is in remission \u2013 and he is hugely thankful he listened to his wife. \u201cI was lucky,\u201d he admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to the doctor as quickly as I should have, but I got away with it and \u2013 touch wood \u2013 I\u2019m in the clear.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c57a0cefe06ee78af56872c541ffb804d7dc0d80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c57a0cefe06ee78af56872c541ffb804d7dc0d80/0_60_721_660/500.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Manson with his family.\" width=\"500\" height=\"458\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Manson with his family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Manson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Often mistakenly viewed as a women-only disease, breast cancer can, and does, strike men, including Mathew Knowles, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s father, who went public with his diagnosis last week.</p> <p>According to research from Breast Cancer Now, about 370 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the UK (versus 55,000 women). Most will get the diagnosis between the ages of 60 and 70. Like women, <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/breast-cancer/stages-types-grades/types/male-breast-cancer\" title=\"\">they are more likely to develop </a><a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/breast-cancer/stages-types-grades/types/male-breast-cancer\" title=\"\">it if they are obese</a>.</p> <p>Because men are more reluctant to visit GPs \u2013 and because of the misconception that only women can get breast cancer \u2013 their breast cancer is typically more advanced by the time it is diagnosed. \u201cWhen men have a suspicious lump in their chest, they often disregard it,\u201d says Prof Valerie Speirs of the University of Aberdeen, a cancer biologist who specialises in male breast cancer. \u201cThis means they usually present at a later stage than women and the cancer can be more difficult for clinicians to treat, because it\u2019s spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMen need to be breast aware,\u201d says Grete Brauten-Smith, a clinical nurse specialist for Breast Cancer Now. She advises men to look out for breast lumps, which can be painless or close to the nipple, inverted nipples, sores on the chest or nipples that won\u2019t heal, swelling under the arm or in the chest area, or nipple discharge, which may also be bloody. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that they check their breast tissue, get to know any changes and report them to their GP.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/sep/26/life-as-a-cancer-patient\">Life as a cancer patient: \u2018I was corroded, I was mutilated, I was uncertain, I was not OK\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was such a shock,\u201d Doug Harper, 57, from Plumstead, says of his breast cancer diagnosis. \u201cI remember telling my mates and them saying: \u2018What do you mean? Men can\u2019t get breast cancer.\u2019\u201d Like Manson, Harper was cajoled into visiting the GP in January 2012 by his wife, after mistakenly thinking he had a cyst on his nipple. \u201cShe said: \u2018Go to the doctor \u2013 this is getting annoying.\u2019\u201d When he took off his T-shirt, the doctor\u2019s entire demeanour changed. Jokingly, Harper asked the doctor if it might be cancer. \u201cHe said: \u2018It could be.\u2019 I said: \u2018Oh God.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Male breast cancer sufferers will find themselves in a system designed for women. When he was recovering from his mastectomy at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich, Harper\u2019s wardmates asked what procedure he was in for. \u201cI\u2019d say I had a mastectomy for breast cancer, and they\u2019d say: \u2018That can\u2019t possibly be right.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He was given the leaflet of a support group, but the wording only referred to female patients. Men attending breast cancer clinics will often be pegged as supportive partners, rather than patients. \u201cYou sit in the mammogram waiting room, and you\u2019re the only bloke there,\u201d Manson says. \u201cYou feel like people are looking at you, thinking you shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"87b4102de7eb6d0761a2150bd6c761ab0f384c7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87b4102de7eb6d0761a2150bd6c761ab0f384c7d/0_0_516_516/500.jpg\" alt=\"Doug Harper.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doug Harper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Harper</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At present, men are excluded from breast cancer clinical trials, although the situation is improving. \u201cThere\u2019s more research into breast cancer in men than there was before. People are starting to realise that male breast cancer needs to receive the same kind of attention that female breast cancer has for years,\u201d Speirs says. More work still needs to be done. \u201cI\u2019d like there to be more awareness of male breast cancer. Everything is a sea of pink.\u201d (The international symbol for breast cancer is a pink ribbon.)</p> <p>Having breast cancer as a man can be isolating in other ways.

      "bodyText": "Andy Manson\u2019s wife, Michelle, had to force him to go to the doctor. Manson, a broadband engineer from Reading, had been experiencing a stabbing pain in his left nipple for months. But he ignored it until December 2013, when it got so bad that Michelle insisted. \u201cShe said: \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re playing at!\u2019\u201d Manson remembers. The speed with which the GP referred him to the breast clinic at the Royal Berkshire hospital was Manson\u2019s first inkling that something was wrong. \u201cYou figure it\u2019s more than just a pain,\u201d Manson, now 48, remembers. He was right. He had stage four breast cancer that had spread to his lymph nodes. Six years on, following a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Manson\u2019s cancer is in remission \u2013 and he is hugely thankful he listened to his wife. \u201cI was lucky,\u201d he admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to the doctor as quickly as I should have, but I got away with it and \u2013 touch wood \u2013 I\u2019m in the clear.\u201d Often mistakenly viewed as a women-only disease, breast cancer can, and does, strike men, including Mathew Knowles, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s father, who went public with his diagnosis last week. According to research from Breast Cancer Now, about 370 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the UK (versus 55,000 women). Most will get the diagnosis between the ages of 60 and 70. Like women, they are more likely to develop it if they are obese. Because men are more reluctant to visit GPs \u2013 and because of the misconception that only women can get breast cancer \u2013 their breast cancer is typically more advanced by the time it is diagnosed. \u201cWhen men have a suspicious lump in their chest, they often disregard it,\u201d says Prof Valerie Speirs of the University of Aberdeen, a cancer biologist who specialises in male breast cancer. \u201cThis means they usually present at a later stage than women and the cancer can be more difficult for clinicians to treat, because it\u2019s spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\u201d \u201cMen need to be breast aware,\u201d says Grete Brauten-Smith, a clinical nurse specialist for Breast Cancer Now. She advises men to look out for breast lumps, which can be painless or close to the nipple, inverted nipples, sores on the chest or nipples that won\u2019t heal, swelling under the arm or in the chest area, or nipple discharge, which may also be bloody. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that they check their breast tissue, get to know any changes and report them to their GP.\u201d \u201cIt was such a shock,\u201d Doug Harper, 57, from Plumstead, says of his breast cancer diagnosis. \u201cI remember telling my mates and them saying: \u2018What do you mean? Men can\u2019t get breast cancer.\u2019\u201d Like Manson, Harper was cajoled into visiting the GP in January 2012 by his wife, after mistakenly thinking he had a cyst on his nipple. \u201cShe said: \u2018Go to the doctor \u2013 this is getting annoying.\u2019\u201d When he took off his T-shirt, the doctor\u2019s entire demeanour changed. Jokingly, Harper asked the doctor if it might be cancer. \u201cHe said: \u2018It could be.\u2019 I said: \u2018Oh God.\u2019\u201d Male breast cancer sufferers will find themselves in a system designed for women. When he was recovering from his mastectomy at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich, Harper\u2019s wardmates asked what procedure he was in for. \u201cI\u2019d say I had a mastectomy for breast cancer, and they\u2019d say: \u2018That can\u2019t possibly be right.\u2019\u201d He was given the leaflet of a support group, but the wording only referred to female patients. Men attending breast cancer clinics will often be pegged as supportive partners, rather than patients. \u201cYou sit in the mammogram waiting room, and you\u2019re the only bloke there,\u201d Manson says. \u201cYou feel like people are looking at you, thinking you shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d At present, men are excluded from breast cancer clinical trials, although the situation is improving. \u201cThere\u2019s more research into breast cancer in men than there was before. People are starting to realise that male breast cancer needs to receive the same kind of attention that female breast cancer has for years,\u201d Speirs says. More work still needs to be done. \u201cI\u2019d like there to be more awareness of male breast cancer. Everything is a sea of pink.\u201d (The international symbol for breast cancer is a pink ribbon.) Having breast cancer as a man can be isolating in other ways. The cancer drug Tamoxifen\u2019s side effects can include impotence, which men may find embarrassing or difficult to talk about. After being diagnosed in January 2012, Harper didn\u2019t meet another man with breast cancer until July of that year, when he took part in a charity event. \u201cI made a beeline for him,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI just wanted to talk with someone else who had been through the same as me.\u201d (Breast Cancer Now runs a matching service to connect male breast cancer patients with other men with the condition.) Recently, when he was going for a routine mammogram \u2013 his cancer is in remission \u2013 Harper saw a young man in his 20s being screened.

Social mores around the 12-week rule are brimming with contradictions: it\u2019s fine to broadcast the minutiae of our daily lives on Instagram, yet disclosing that we\u2019re pregnant, even just to close friends and family, is somehow transgressive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/25/30-year-child-health-study-parenting-alspac-jean-golding\">How a pioneering study of child health has influenced a generation of parents | Juliet Rix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a result, the first trimester is a sort of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s pregnancy: you\u2019re legitimately pregnant when it comes to dos and don\u2019ts such as taking folic acid, but if you miscarry you\u2019re often told that it wasn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d pregnancy anyway. Before I went to the operating theatre to have my dead baby surgically removed from my uterus, a nurse remarked that until the invention of home pregnancy tests, most women probably wouldn\u2019t have known they were pregnant at that stage, and would have assumed their miscarriage was a heavy period.</p> <p>While it\u2019s certainly thanks to modern ultrasound technology that my husband and I had seen our baby\u2019s beautiful heartbeat twice before I miscarried, a host of early pregnancy symptoms and having to pass a not-insubstantial gestational sac would probably have tipped me off.</p> <p>We\u2019re often told that miscarriages are no big deal because they\u2019re really common; so is divorce, but you don\u2019t often hear anyone say, \u201cSorry your husband left you \u2013 but it\u2019s really common, and you can always get married again.\u201d Yet for something so common, it can feel so incredibly lonely, precisely because the 12-week rule perpetuates the notion that early pregnancy loss is something to hide and we shouldn\u2019t make a fuss.</p> <p>This establishes a hierarchy of grief determined by the stage of gestation, that glibly dismisses early miscarriages as \u201cjust a ball of cells\u201d, deeming only later losses worthy of mourning. But the meaning of any pregnancy is deeply personal, and we can\u2019t neatly fit the impact of losing it in its own discrete box. Ellie Jesky experienced miscarriages on both sides of the 12-week line. \u201cThe moment you get that positive test, however much you know that it\u2019s precarious and that things can go wrong, it\u2019s your baby,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou plan and imagine what their life will be like.

      "bodyText": "Most of us will be familiar with the \u201c12-week\u201d rule \u2013 the longstanding social convention that dictates that women mustn\u2019t tell anyone they\u2019re pregnant before the 12-week mark, \u201cin case something happens\u201d. It\u2019s time to talk about the insidious effect it has on women who suffer a miscarriage early in their pregnancy. An estimated 650 babies are miscarried every day in the UK, with the vast majority occurring during the first trimester. Most of these losses will be suffered in silence, because it\u2019s considered so socially unacceptable to reveal that you\u2019re pregnant before 12 weeks \u2013 let alone that you were pregnant, but now you\u2019re not. It\u2019s baffling that in 2019 we seem so wedded to an anachronistic superstition about tempting fate that shames women into keeping quiet and heaps blame on the woman who dares to \u201ctell\u201d and subsequently loses her baby \u2013 as though we were still in a bygone era where the stigma of miscarrying could mark you out as cursed. Social mores around the 12-week rule are brimming with contradictions: it\u2019s fine to broadcast the minutiae of our daily lives on Instagram, yet disclosing that we\u2019re pregnant, even just to close friends and family, is somehow transgressive. As a result, the first trimester is a sort of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s pregnancy: you\u2019re legitimately pregnant when it comes to dos and don\u2019ts such as taking folic acid, but if you miscarry you\u2019re often told that it wasn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d pregnancy anyway. Before I went to the operating theatre to have my dead baby surgically removed from my uterus, a nurse remarked that until the invention of home pregnancy tests, most women probably wouldn\u2019t have known they were pregnant at that stage, and would have assumed their miscarriage was a heavy period. While it\u2019s certainly thanks to modern ultrasound technology that my husband and I had seen our baby\u2019s beautiful heartbeat twice before I miscarried, a host of early pregnancy symptoms and having to pass a not-insubstantial gestational sac would probably have tipped me off. We\u2019re often told that miscarriages are no big deal because they\u2019re really common; so is divorce, but you don\u2019t often hear anyone say, \u201cSorry your husband left you \u2013 but it\u2019s really common, and you can always get married again.\u201d Yet for something so common, it can feel so incredibly lonely, precisely because the 12-week rule perpetuates the notion that early pregnancy loss is something to hide and we shouldn\u2019t make a fuss. This establishes a hierarchy of grief determined by the stage of gestation, that glibly dismisses early miscarriages as \u201cjust a ball of cells\u201d, deeming only later losses worthy of mourning. But the meaning of any pregnancy is deeply personal, and we can\u2019t neatly fit the impact of losing it in its own discrete box. Ellie Jesky experienced miscarriages on both sides of the 12-week line. \u201cThe moment you get that positive test, however much you know that it\u2019s precarious and that things can go wrong, it\u2019s your baby,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou plan and imagine what their life will be like. And then when that\u2019s totally ripped away in an instant it\u2019s a genuine loss, regardless of how far along.\u201d The consequence of this culture of secrecy and lack of compassionate discussion is that many women grieve for their miscarriages in the shadows, weighed down by heavy feelings of guilt and failure. Desperate for answers beyond unsatisfactory explanations such as \u201cit\u2019s just one of those things\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s nature\u2019s way\u201d, or \u201cit wasn\u2019t meant to be\u201d, we\u2019ll seize upon any excuse to blame ourselves. Most early losses are due to chromosomal abnormalities; but according to Prof Arri Coomarasamy, director of Tommy\u2019s National Centre for Miscarriage Research, fewer than half of women who suffer repeated miscarriages ever find out why. The decision about how, when and if we share our experiences of fertility, pregnancy and loss should be a personal choice, not an enforced obligation. Miscarriage will always be a sad reality in many people\u2019s lives, but greater understanding and empathy could alleviate much of this pain. We\u2019re starting to see more open discussion around miscarriage in public discourse. I\u2019m hopeful that the more comfortably we can each own our story the more we\u2019ll feel empowered to seek support when we suffer losses at any stage of pregnancy. \u201cEven if we can\u2019t cure miscarriage,\u201d says Dr Jessica Zucker, a psychologist specialising in women\u2019s reproductive health and creator of the #IHadaMiscarriage campaign, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we at least attempt to cure the conversation?\u201d \u2022 Katy Lindemann is author of a forthcoming book that shares real women\u2019s stories about the emotional experience of infertility and pregnancy loss",

      "body": "<p>When he published the second edition of the greatest of political satires, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/06/100-novels-swift-gullivers-travels-mccrum\" title=\"\"><em>Gulliver\u2019s Travels</em></a>, Jonathan Swift prefaced it with an outraged letter from Gulliver himself. His chief complaint was that his book had failed to change anything: \u201cinstead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold, after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath produced one single effect according to mine intentions\u2026\u201d The joke is not just on Gulliver, but on Swift himself and indeed on the art of satire. When did its mockery ever put a full stop to the abuses it attacks?</p> <p>It seems safe to assume that Ian McEwan does not suffer from Gulliver\u2019s delusions. His short, sharp satire on Brexit is not going to stop it, or to change the mind of any reader who supports it. The classical idea that satire can reform the polity has even less purchase now than it had in Swift\u2019s 18th century. Its mechanism was shame: the rulers would see an image of themselves in the distorting mirror of the writer\u2019s fable, feel ashamed of themselves and resolve to be better. But ours is an age of political shamelessness. In the era of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, the rulers create their own grotesque self-parodies and flaunt them before their adoring fans.</p> <p>In that context, McEwan has more limited (and realistic) ambitions. <em>The Cockroach</em> aims not to persuade or in any profound sense to critique. It is written to comfort and entertain those who already believe that the Brexit project is deranged. And even in that McEwan faces a formidable challenge. Brexit has such a camp, knowing, performative quality that it is almost impossible to inflate it any further. How do you make a show of people who are doing such a fabulous job of making a show of themselves? McEwan manages to do so with great style and comic panache.</p> <p>Last year, someone put online a brilliant mock-up of an old orange Penguin paperback cover: Brexit by Franz Kafka. The cockroach of McEwan\u2019s title is of course a version of the giant insect into which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/20/the-enduring-truth-of-kafkas-metamorphosis\" title=\"\">Gregor Samsa</a> awakes to find himself transformed in Kafka\u2019s novella <em>The Metamorphosis</em>. His opening line echoes Kafka\u2019s: \u201cThat morning, Jim Sams, clever but by no means profound, woke from uneasy dreams to find himself transformed into a gigantic creature.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The great political project that is roiling Britain is as elaborately bonkers as those Gulliver encounters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But in truth the parallel is misleading. It is not just that in McEwan\u2019s case the metamorphosis is reversed: Sams is not a human transmuted into an insect but a cockroach who has taken over the body of the prime minister of the UK. (The room in which he awakes is in 10 Downing Street.) It is also that this fable is much more Swiftian than Kafkaesque. In <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, the story is really about the strangeness of everyday life and the human capacity to deny it. The world of <em>The Cockroach</em> is more like one of Swift\u2019s parallel universes where political and intellectual idiocies are not so much reduced to absurdity as magnified into towering follies.</p> <p>Comparing one\u2019s political opponents to cockroaches is a toxic metaphor with a nasty political history and it is hard to read McEwan\u2019s novella without a degree of discomfort. Jim Sams is essentially a Theresa May (derided by his backbench zealots as \u201cnot a true go-it-alone man\u201d) who metamorphoses into a Boris Johnson, a gung-ho go-it-alone man. (McEwan is sufficiently up to date to have him promise to proceed \u201cdo or die\u201d and his adviser speculate that he could \u201cprorogue parliament for a few months\u201d.) We soon learn that all of his cabinet bar the patrician foreign secretary are also cockroaches in \u201csuperficial human form\u201d. This is dangerous terrain, and McEwan just about gets through it by stepping lightly and moving fast.</p> <p>What keeps him going is his brilliant answer to the question of what could possibly be more absurd than Brexit. He is far too clever to try to compete directly with the real goings-on in Whitehall and Westminster. Instead, the great political project that is roiling Britain is as elaborately bonkers as those that Gulliver encounters on his third voyage: extracting sunlight from cucumbers or softening marble to make pillows.

      "bodyText": "When he published the second edition of the greatest of political satires, Gulliver\u2019s Travels, Jonathan Swift prefaced it with an outraged letter from Gulliver himself. His chief complaint was that his book had failed to change anything: \u201cinstead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold, after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath produced one single effect according to mine intentions\u2026\u201d The joke is not just on Gulliver, but on Swift himself and indeed on the art of satire. When did its mockery ever put a full stop to the abuses it attacks? It seems safe to assume that Ian McEwan does not suffer from Gulliver\u2019s delusions. His short, sharp satire on Brexit is not going to stop it, or to change the mind of any reader who supports it. The classical idea that satire can reform the polity has even less purchase now than it had in Swift\u2019s 18th century. Its mechanism was shame: the rulers would see an image of themselves in the distorting mirror of the writer\u2019s fable, feel ashamed of themselves and resolve to be better. But ours is an age of political shamelessness. In the era of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, the rulers create their own grotesque self-parodies and flaunt them before their adoring fans. In that context, McEwan has more limited (and realistic) ambitions. The Cockroach aims not to persuade or in any profound sense to critique. It is written to comfort and entertain those who already believe that the Brexit project is deranged. And even in that McEwan faces a formidable challenge. Brexit has such a camp, knowing, performative quality that it is almost impossible to inflate it any further. How do you make a show of people who are doing such a fabulous job of making a show of themselves? McEwan manages to do so with great style and comic panache. Last year, someone put online a brilliant mock-up of an old orange Penguin paperback cover: Brexit by Franz Kafka. The cockroach of McEwan\u2019s title is of course a version of the giant insect into which Gregor Samsa awakes to find himself transformed in Kafka\u2019s novella The Metamorphosis. His opening line echoes Kafka\u2019s: \u201cThat morning, Jim Sams, clever but by no means profound, woke from uneasy dreams to find himself transformed into a gigantic creature.\u201d But in truth the parallel is misleading. It is not just that in McEwan\u2019s case the metamorphosis is reversed: Sams is not a human transmuted into an insect but a cockroach who has taken over the body of the prime minister of the UK. (The room in which he awakes is in 10 Downing Street.) It is also that this fable is much more Swiftian than Kafkaesque. In The Metamorphosis, the story is really about the strangeness of everyday life and the human capacity to deny it. The world of The Cockroach is more like one of Swift\u2019s parallel universes where political and intellectual idiocies are not so much reduced to absurdity as magnified into towering follies. Comparing one\u2019s political opponents to cockroaches is a toxic metaphor with a nasty political history and it is hard to read McEwan\u2019s novella without a degree of discomfort. Jim Sams is essentially a Theresa May (derided by his backbench zealots as \u201cnot a true go-it-alone man\u201d) who metamorphoses into a Boris Johnson, a gung-ho go-it-alone man. (McEwan is sufficiently up to date to have him promise to proceed \u201cdo or die\u201d and his adviser speculate that he could \u201cprorogue parliament for a few months\u201d.) We soon learn that all of his cabinet bar the patrician foreign secretary are also cockroaches in \u201csuperficial human form\u201d. This is dangerous terrain, and McEwan just about gets through it by stepping lightly and moving fast. What keeps him going is his brilliant answer to the question of what could possibly be more absurd than Brexit. He is far too clever to try to compete directly with the real goings-on in Whitehall and Westminster. Instead, the great political project that is roiling Britain is as elaborately bonkers as those that Gulliver encounters on his third voyage: extracting sunlight from cucumbers or softening marble to make pillows. McEwan\u2019s parallel universe version of Brexit is the cracked theory of Reversalism, in which the flow of money is reversed: workers have to pay their employers but in turn are paid for shopping. Trade will function by exporters giving Britain money to take their goods; Britain will in turn pay other countries to import its products and services. The only problem being that the only other country that agrees to this reversal is St Kitts and Nevis.

They are reliable buoys that help us to bob along when the past threatens to overwhelm.</p> <p>Until recent years, one particular date would loom ahead of me bleakly every New Year. My father died on 11 January 1984, during a hip replacement operation to ease his ankylosing spondylitis, a condition that inflamed his spine and joints. He was 33, my mother 32; I was five, my brother one. I remember seeing him for the last time at the front door of our house; the last question he asked me was to find out what was number one in the pop charts (our mutual love fed my early obsession with music and eventual career as a music journalist).</p> <p>When I was young the anniversary of Dad\u2019s death always passed as quietly as possible; something to get through in the dark days of winter. The timing was annoyingly unfair: I longed to feel the excitement of the new calendar, the hope of a clean slate, a fresh start. I didn\u2019t admit to myself that each 11 January offered a comfort of sorts. After all, it was the date he would have looked at on his digital watch before he went down to the operating theatre wondering what would happen when he came out the other side. As the years pulled away from that extreme moment of loss, the seasonal reminder of where he was then and where I was now gave the day a much needed weight. My grief still needed that connection.</p> <p>But in 2017, something significant changed. I had had a child myself, which made me think profoundly about what I had lost with my father. What was I was missing exactly? A chance to talk to him, certainly. A chance to share moments, definitely. I couldn\u2019t do the former but could I do the latter?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7ece8d2fa96b8afac620147ff32e7e6aebf2d1e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ece8d2fa96b8afac620147ff32e7e6aebf2d1e2/0_0_668_684/488.jpg\" alt=\"Rogers with her Dad.\" width=\"488\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rogers with her Dad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Jude Rogers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not long after, I read an article about DNA that made me think about the connections between people, biological and otherwise. It struck me that my father had given me life, which meant that his life was in me. So perhaps I could continue his existence through mine, in a new way. What would someone who loved you very much want you to do after they were dead? Live life to the fullest.</p> <p>Since then, Dad\u2019s anniversary has fundamentally changed in its shape. It is no longer a day to mourn but a day to celebrate. I had intimated from recollections that my father was an adventurous soul, who enjoyed discovering new places: my mother described their honeymoon travelling in Holland, as instigated by him, and said he talked of visiting the Dead Sea. Wanderlust was an instinct I shared, so our day would be about amplifying that union. It would involve going somewhere that felt out of the ordinary, somewhere magical that would provide joy.</p> <p>It helped that my husband and I had just moved with our son to the Welsh borders, a very different place to our previous home in London. The first year we celebrated my father, we went to the Malvern hills, an hour away in Worcestershire. I had been captivated by their long, jagged peaks out of the corner of my eye from nearby motorways. The drive towards them felt dreamlike: we rarely took time out to do things like this. We arrived and up we went; I felt them under my feet. On the ridge, I felt new.</p> <p>The year after, we drove to another place that pops up like an apparition from different vantage points on the Welsh borders: May hill, a small collection of trees on a high peak in Gloucestershire. From afar, it looks eerie. Up close, the tree trunks pull upwards, slim-spined, magnetised to the sky.</p> <p>This change has transformed how I deal with grief in regular life. To be able to access something so magical on the day, it being there to touch, to breathe in \u2013 this feels like everything. It also helps that I pick each place at the last minute in the New Year: I go with my gut, jump in the car. It means these experiences don\u2019t hang in front of me heavily too, offering a disquieting connection with sadness and absence. They offer a gravity founded in the power of human connection, new experiences and love. Dad and I are together in that beautiful moment, in that gleam of a clean slate, the glow of a fresh start.</p>",

The timing was annoyingly unfair: I longed to feel the excitement of the new calendar, the hope of a clean slate, a fresh start. I didn\u2019t admit to myself that each 11 January offered a comfort of sorts. After all, it was the date he would have looked at on his digital watch before he went down to the operating theatre wondering what would happen when he came out the other side. As the years pulled away from that extreme moment of loss, the seasonal reminder of where he was then and where I was now gave the day a much needed weight. My grief still needed that connection. But in 2017, something significant changed. I had had a child myself, which made me think profoundly about what I had lost with my father. What was I was missing exactly? A chance to talk to him, certainly. A chance to share moments, definitely. I couldn\u2019t do the former but could I do the latter? Not long after, I read an article about DNA that made me think about the connections between people, biological and otherwise. It struck me that my father had given me life, which meant that his life was in me. So perhaps I could continue his existence through mine, in a new way. What would someone who loved you very much want you to do after they were dead? Live life to the fullest. Since then, Dad\u2019s anniversary has fundamentally changed in its shape. It is no longer a day to mourn but a day to celebrate. I had intimated from recollections that my father was an adventurous soul, who enjoyed discovering new places: my mother described their honeymoon travelling in Holland, as instigated by him, and said he talked of visiting the Dead Sea. Wanderlust was an instinct I shared, so our day would be about amplifying that union. It would involve going somewhere that felt out of the ordinary, somewhere magical that would provide joy. It helped that my husband and I had just moved with our son to the Welsh borders, a very different place to our previous home in London. The first year we celebrated my father, we went to the Malvern hills, an hour away in Worcestershire. I had been captivated by their long, jagged peaks out of the corner of my eye from nearby motorways. The drive towards them felt dreamlike: we rarely took time out to do things like this. We arrived and up we went; I felt them under my feet. On the ridge, I felt new. The year after, we drove to another place that pops up like an apparition from different vantage points on the Welsh borders: May hill, a small collection of trees on a high peak in Gloucestershire. From afar, it looks eerie. Up close, the tree trunks pull upwards, slim-spined, magnetised to the sky. This change has transformed how I deal with grief in regular life. To be able to access something so magical on the day, it being there to touch, to breathe in \u2013 this feels like everything. It also helps that I pick each place at the last minute in the New Year: I go with my gut, jump in the car. It means these experiences don\u2019t hang in front of me heavily too, offering a disquieting connection with sadness and absence. They offer a gravity founded in the power of human connection, new experiences and love. Dad and I are together in that beautiful moment, in that gleam of a clean slate, the glow of a fresh start.",

While the 188g weight is fairly heavy compared with rivals, the rest of the dimensions compare favourably, making the iPhone 11 Pro one of the easiest of devices to pocket, hold and use with one hand.</p> <p>Apple\u2019s Super Retina XDR \u201cPro level\u201d OLED screen is new for this year and is considerably brighter during regular usage and when displaying Dolby Vision or HDR10 content.</p> <p>It\u2019s a gorgeous display. Sharp, bright, colour-rich and full of contrast. At 60Hz it isn\u2019t quite as smooth a screen as the 90Hz display on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/31/oneplus-7-pro-review-an-absolute-beast-in-every-way\">OnePlus 7 Pro</a>, but it wins on all other counts against everything else, particularly at this size.</p> <p>Flip the phone over and you will see a new frosted glass back, which is more grippy when the phone and your hands are cold, but less so than the previous glossy coating when both are warm. The camera lump is now a square raised glass section in the top right with three cameras arranged in a triangle. If you suffer from <a href=\"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/technology/mobiles-and-tabs/110919/apple-iphone-11-is-triggering-peoples-fear-of-tiny-holes.html\">trypophobia</a> (that\u2019s an aversion to clusters of small holes) the iPhone 11 Pro is definitely not for you.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> 5.8in Super Retina XDR (OLED) (458ppi)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> Apple A13 Bionic</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 4GB of RAM</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 64, 256 or 512GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> iOS 13</p></li> <li><p><strong>Camera:</strong> Triple 12MP rear cameras with OIS, 12MP front-facing camera</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> LTE, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5, Lightning, Ultra Wideband and GPS</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 144 x 71.4 x 8.1 mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 188g</p></li> </ul> <h2>A13 Bionic</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bca5f90587479e34346435868292eb0f9fe7677b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bca5f90587479e34346435868292eb0f9fe7677b/661_207_3615_2169/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iphone 11 pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max still use Apple\u2019s Lightning connector for charging.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The iPhone 11 Pro has the same A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage as the rest of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/01/iphone-11-review-iphone-xr-dual-camera-a13-smartphone\">iPhone 11</a> line, and performs similarly. Everything happens promptly, including intensive tasks such as video editing and gaming.</p> <p>The iPhone 11 Pro will handle everything you need now, and will likely be a top performer for years to come. There are two small disappointments, however. Despite being \u201cPro\u201d the new phone still uses the old Lightning connector for charging, not the much more powerful and adaptable USB-C to which Apple switched all its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/04/apple-macbook-air-review-the-new-default-mac\">MacBook laptops</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/12/apple-129in-ipad-pro-review-bringing-back-the-wow-factor\">recent iPad Pro</a>.</p> <p>The starting storage of 64GB is also disappointing.

      "bodyText": "Apple\u2019s iPhone has gone \u201cpro\u201d for its 11th iteration, with dramatically improved cameras and longer battery life, which make the smaller iPhone 11 Pro the king of more manageable phones. Costing from \u00a31,049 the iPhone 11 Pro is one of a rare breed: a premium flagship smartphone that doesn\u2019t have a ginormous screen and is therefore small by today\u2019s standards. Everything is relative, of course. The iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s 5.8in screen is considerably larger than the 4in iPhone SE, but compared with the monsters of the modern smartphone era with their 6.5in-plus screens the iPhone 11 Pro is positively pocketable. Going Pro The iPhone 11 Pro is essentially the same on the outside as the mould-breaking iPhone X from 2017, with a stainless steel and glass body, Face ID notch and 5.8in screen. The new phone is 0.4mm taller, 0.5mm wider, 0.4mm thicker and 11g heavier than the iPhone XS that came before it, but you\u2019d be very hard pressed to tell, even side-by-side. While the 188g weight is fairly heavy compared with rivals, the rest of the dimensions compare favourably, making the iPhone 11 Pro one of the easiest of devices to pocket, hold and use with one hand. Apple\u2019s Super Retina XDR \u201cPro level\u201d OLED screen is new for this year and is considerably brighter during regular usage and when displaying Dolby Vision or HDR10 content. It\u2019s a gorgeous display. Sharp, bright, colour-rich and full of contrast. At 60Hz it isn\u2019t quite as smooth a screen as the 90Hz display on the OnePlus 7 Pro, but it wins on all other counts against everything else, particularly at this size. Flip the phone over and you will see a new frosted glass back, which is more grippy when the phone and your hands are cold, but less so than the previous glossy coating when both are warm. The camera lump is now a square raised glass section in the top right with three cameras arranged in a triangle. If you suffer from trypophobia (that\u2019s an aversion to clusters of small holes) the iPhone 11 Pro is definitely not for you. Specifications Screen: 5.8in Super Retina XDR (OLED) (458ppi) Processor: Apple A13 Bionic RAM: 4GB of RAM Storage: 64, 256 or 512GB Operating system: iOS 13 Camera: Triple 12MP rear cameras with OIS, 12MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5, Lightning, Ultra Wideband and GPS Dimensions: 144 x 71.4 x 8.1 mm Weight: 188g A13 Bionic The iPhone 11 Pro has the same A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage as the rest of the iPhone 11 line, and performs similarly. Everything happens promptly, including intensive tasks such as video editing and gaming. The iPhone 11 Pro will handle everything you need now, and will likely be a top performer for years to come. There are two small disappointments, however. Despite being \u201cPro\u201d the new phone still uses the old Lightning connector for charging, not the much more powerful and adaptable USB-C to which Apple switched all its MacBook laptops and the recent iPad Pro. The starting storage of 64GB is also disappointing. For anyone shooting any amount of 4K video you\u2019ll very quickly fill 64GB, and even if you\u2019re not a \u201cpro\u201d creative, then apps, games and movies will make short work of the space. Apple says that it\u2019s managed to make the iPhone 11 Pro last four hours longer between charges than the iPhone XS, which only just managed 24 hours in my testing \u2013 which itself was worse than the iPhone X at 30 hours. I\u2019m pleased to report that the iPhone 11 Pro beats Apple\u2019s estimates and lasts eight hours longer than the iPhone XS, at just shy of 32 hours. It will get me from 7am on day one until almost 4pm on day two. Attaching an Apple Watch Series 5 made negligible difference to the battery life of the iPhone too. That was after the iOS 13.1.2 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day. The iPhone 11 Pro is the first Apple smartphone to ship with an 18W USB-C fast charger and a USB-C to Lightning cable in the box. A full charge from flat took just over two hours 10 minutes, but a 50% charge was reached in 28 minutes and 70% in 43 minutes. As with the iPhone 11, Apple is clearly slowing charging to a trickle above 95%, meaning that charging much beyond 90% unless you need it probably isn\u2019t worth it. The phone also gets pretty hot when fast charging. It can wirelessly charge too, but can\u2019t charge other devices. It\u2019s also worth noting that iOS 13 includes a battery optimising feature, which is designed to learn your habits and only charge the battery past 80% when it thinks you need it to extend its longevity. iOS 13.1.2 The iPhone 11 Pro shipped with iOS 13 but was quickly updated three times to iOS 13.1.2, following the same issues suffered with the iPhone 11. The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which switches the interface a predominately black or dark background with white text. Dark mode theoretically has a battery benefit for the iPhone 11 Pro thanks to the OLED screen, which only consumes electricity for pixels that aren\u2019t black, making white text on a predominantly black background more power efficient than black on white. But you\u2019ll only see a meaningful benefit if the background is truly black and not a dark shade of grey. Other highlights include the ability to swipe-type on the default keyboard, a long-press on control centre buttons now opens up quick connect menus for Bluetooth or wifi, as well as quickly jumping to the settings app. Photos now has an improved view of all your photos. You can silence unknown and spam callers, while location permissions for apps have been improved and there\u2019s menstrual cycle and headphone audio level tracking in the Health app, which also now has a new more useful summary view. Apple leads the industry in software updates, providing at least five years of support from release, where other manufacturers cap out at about three years, and has recently shown a surprising ability to rapidly push out bug-fix updates in quick succession. Camera The iPhone 11 Pro has Apple\u2019s first triple 12-megapixel camera setup. It has the same normal and 2x telephoto configuration as previous models, but adds the new ultrawide camera from the iPhone 11. The combination gives you the ability to shoot at 0.5x, 1x or 2x optical zoom then up to 10x digital zoom. Apple calls this a \u201cpro camera system\u201d and like the dual-camera system fitted to the iPhone 11, it is a noticeable step up from last year, producing some of the best images I\u2019ve had the pleasure to shoot across a range of different lighting conditions. Apple\u2019s new night mode brings the iPhone 11 Pro up to par with the gold-standard of Google\u2019s Pixel 3 in very low-light photography, but note that it only operates on the main camera not the ultrawide or telephoto. The automatic mode takes multiple frames between one and three seconds when handheld, depending on available light and how much you\u2019re shaking the phone. Stick it on a tripod and you can set it to up to 30 seconds, which is best illustrated with starry sky shots - something I couldn\u2019t test in dank, rainy Britain. Smart HDR has been improved in bright lighting conditions too, producing well controlled highlights with detail in both shadow and bright spots. Images are slightly less flat and more dramatic than the XS last year too, which is a good thing. The deep fusion technology, which will be enabled on the iPhone 11 series with iOS 13.2 (tested in beta for this review), also made a huge difference in fine detail particularly in middling light. For the first time with any smartphone, including the Pixel 3, we\u2019re approaching the level of sharpness and clarity at full crop that only a proper camera with a large lens has managed in the past. Video capture from the rear camera is fantastic, arguably the best in the business, including 4K at 60 frames per second. With a third-party app you can also shoot from more than one of the cameras at once, which might be useful for filmmakers, but I can\u2019t ever see myself needing to do that. The selfie camera is also improved, bumped to 12-megapixels and capable of capturing an almost terrifying level of detail in good lighting. The front-facing camera can also do slow motion selfies, which kids and big kids will love. Overall the camera on the iPhone 11 Pro is a big step up, levelling to or exceeding rivals from the first half of 2019 in the most important features. Observations The iPhone 11 Pro is water resistant to IP68 standards of up to 4 metres for 30 minutes, which is 2 metres deeper than last year\u2019s iPhone XS Bluetooth performance is much improved, with stronger connections to even the weakest of headphones Face ID is still best-in-class, now slightly faster and working at slightly wider angles The new U1 chip enables enhanced location abilities, but so far it\u2019s used only for directional AirDrop file sharing The highly polished stainless steel is easy to mark and dull after even careful general use The pressure sensitive screen of previous iPhones is gone and with it 3D Touch, so you can\u2019t press harder on things anymore Price The iPhone 11 Pro costs \u00a31,049 for 64GB of storage, \u00a31,199 for 256GB or \u00a31,399 for 512GB in black, green, silver or gold. For comparison, the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs \u00a31,149, the iPhone 11 costs \u00a3729, the iPhone XR costs \u00a3629, the OnePlus 7 costs \u00a3499, the Samsung Galaxy S10 costs \u00a3799 and the Huawei P30 Pro costs \u00a3799. Verdict After a misstep last year, Apple is back on top with what is simply the best smaller phone available. The iPhone 11 Pro has longer battery life, a better screen and excellent performance all round. The camera is also a big improvement in terms of clarity and performance, particularly in fine detail and very low light, with the added night mode now matching rivals. It won\u2019t yet replace a digital SLR for my professional photography, but it\u2019s closer than anything there has been before.

I won\u2019t pretend the iPhone 11 Pro is even remotely good value, because it\u2019s not. Even if you do get five years of software support. For \u00a31,049 and up you\u2019re buying a product that is unrivalled at this size and paying a hefty premium price for the privilege. Pros: brilliant camera, night mode, water resistant, wireless charging, Face ID, good battery life, good performance, brilliant screen, long software support, manageable size Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, super expensive, no headphones adapter in the box, low starting storage Other reviews Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and ranked Samsung Galaxy S10 review: the sweet spot OnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every way Huawei P30 Pro review: game-changing camera, stellar battery life Fairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy",

      "bodyText": "For decades he has been reviled as a simple-minded and sadistic dictator, or lampooned as a clownish thug. Now tens of thousands of newly discovered images have shown how Idi Amin exploited cutting-edge media technology, populism and radical ideologies to maintain his bloody grip on power in the 1970s. Most of the 70,000 pictures were taken by a team of photographers from the information ministry who followed the Ugandan dictator over the course of his eight-year rule. Many show Amin at public occasions, but some are of private episodes, such as the arrest and humiliation of alleged petty criminals shortly before their execution. Others are more intimate, showing the dictator with his family or close associates, and were taken by officials and associates. Amin is seen with his children surrounded by Christmas decorations, playing the accordion and swimming. Historians say the images, found in a locked filing cabinet at the Ugandan state broadcaster\u2019s offices by archivists four years ago but only now given a public view, provide extraordinary new insights into Amin and the nature of his regime, which was one of the worst in post-colonial Africa. They also cast new light on the reality of life for ordinary Ugandans under the rule of a man held responsible for between 100,000 and 500,000 deaths. Rose Mwanja Nkaale, the commissioner of the government\u2019s museums and monuments department, said she had been surprised to see images of a \u201cjovial character who was very social with the common people\u201d. \u201cIt made me wonder what turned him into what he became. He started well but turned into something else. We need to learn about what we must fight against to stop these things ever happening again,\u201d Nkaale said. During Amin\u2019s rule, security services and the military targeted different ethnic communities seen as potentially disloyal, as well as real and imagined opponents. Journalists, judges, businesspeople, artists, officials and clerics were abducted, tortured and killed. Victims included Uganda\u2019s Anglican archbishop and one of Amin\u2019s own wives. Dr Richard Vokes, an anthropologist at the University of Western Australia, who was involved in the discovery, said the photographs depicted a \u201ckind of manic energy\u201d that was both \u201cbehind the brutality and part of the brutality\u201d. \u201cWe see how [Amin] embraced the media and understood its power ... How he had a great sense of how media could amplify his ego and his political will,\u201d Vokes said. The display of a selection of the pictures at Uganda\u2019s national museum in a pioneering exhibition has been welcomed by many of Amin\u2019s relatives, as well as the families of some of his victims. Sarah Bananuka, whose father and three brothers were murdered during Amin\u2019s rule, said the exhibition was a good initiative but expressed concern that the official photographs might hide the grim reality of the regime. \u201cIn these pictures you see him in parties, enjoying life and meeting people. We didn\u2019t see the other side of Amin, which we felt, lived and experienced,\u201d the 69-year-old said. Hajji Edrisa Mayanja Njuki, the head of the presidential press unit during the 1970s, said the exhibition depicted the \u201creal Amin\u201d. \u201cThe pictures that show his good side had never been produced and published.

      "body": "<p>The Mourne Mountains have inspired writers, musicians and adventurers for centuries. The literary connections \u2013 the mountains sweeping down to the sea in the songs of Percy French, or inspiring CS Lewis\u2019s Narnia \u2013 have given way in recent years to the TV titan that is Game of Thrones. Much of the series was filmed around these mountains, making them, in the space of a decade, Northern Ireland\u2019s most valuable tourist draw.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b506598c60c8975ae0090ae3c89903a67312012d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b506598c60c8975ae0090ae3c89903a67312012d/0_0_941_649/500.jpg\" alt=\"County Down map\" width=\"500\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But older (and arguably more enduring) than the Thrones juggernaut is the lure of this area for adventure sports enthusiasts. County Down has an extraordinarily diverse landscape, and Newcastle, an attractive seaside resort in the shadow of Slieve Donard (Northern Ireland\u2019s highest mountain at 850 metres) capitalises commendably on its enviable setting. It\u2019s the perfect base for those in search of an adrenaline rush.</p> <p>Set your sights high from the outset by taking a hike to the top of Donard, a five- to six-hour round trip. Climbs begin from Donard Park, just minutes from the centre of Newcastle and close to popular pubs and cafes. The mountain is hardly a colossus but it\u2019s a significant challenge and not to be taken lightly, especially given the notoriously unpredictable local weather. At the summit, on a clear day the views over the Irish Sea take in the Isle of Man and the coastlines of Wales and Scotland.</p> <p>Below Donard, the Kilkeel Road hugs the coast south to Bloody Bridge, which derives its name from a massacre during the 1641 Irish Rebellion and is another access point to the Mournes\u2019 activities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2aa6bfd592a3c92f6d29afddd252905673af7b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2aa6bfd592a3c92f6d29afddd252905673af7b3/0_35_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bloody Bridge River for walks and \u2018wet bouldering\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bloody Bridge River for walks and \u2018wet bouldering\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a campsite here and a public car park where a range of guided walks begin, and it is also the launch point for \u201cwet bouldering\u201d. As the name implies, this is basically a water-based version of traditional bouldering \u2013 rope-free climbing on rock formations \u2013 so as well as clambering up and around huge rocks, you can also expect to be plunging and sliding into the deep pools and waterfalls of the Bloody Bridge River. This is where all the unstoppable water running off the eastern slopes of Donard gathers and meets immovable granite, creating an epic natural water park. Invigorating and inspiring, this is an experience that can be tailored for a range of ages.</p> <p>Or swap freshwater for saltwater and have a go at coasteering. You\u2019ll be on the same side of Donard, but this time leaping from its steep lower reaches into the cold froth of the Irish Sea. There are various levels for this activity, depending on age or nerve. Those short on years or valour should start with the half-day experience at Maggie\u2019s Leap, which also begins at the Bloody Bridge car park. (Evocative place names derived from local folklore are another enduring feature of the Mournes.)</p> <p>To bob on the water rather than plunge into it, sea kayaking trips explore rocky inlets, small stony beaches and caves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ee45cecbeeb7ecc6b8f7a45df1afe1bd5229fce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ee45cecbeeb7ecc6b8f7a45df1afe1bd5229fce/0_64_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kayaking on Castlewellan Lake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kayaking on Castlewellan Lake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inland, two forest parks offer activity bases. <a href=\"http://www.tollymore.com/\" title=\"\">Tollymore</a> is home to Northern Ireland\u2019s National Outdoor Centre, which also has excellent indoor facilities, including a 9.5-metre climbing wall and bouldering area with expert tuition (entry \u00a35, under-14s \u00a32.50, four-evening skills course adult \u00a364, child \u00a340, one-day course \u00a367).

      "bodyText": "The Mourne Mountains have inspired writers, musicians and adventurers for centuries. The literary connections \u2013 the mountains sweeping down to the sea in the songs of Percy French, or inspiring CS Lewis\u2019s Narnia \u2013 have given way in recent years to the TV titan that is Game of Thrones. Much of the series was filmed around these mountains, making them, in the space of a decade, Northern Ireland\u2019s most valuable tourist draw. But older (and arguably more enduring) than the Thrones juggernaut is the lure of this area for adventure sports enthusiasts. County Down has an extraordinarily diverse landscape, and Newcastle, an attractive seaside resort in the shadow of Slieve Donard (Northern Ireland\u2019s highest mountain at 850 metres) capitalises commendably on its enviable setting. It\u2019s the perfect base for those in search of an adrenaline rush. Set your sights high from the outset by taking a hike to the top of Donard, a five- to six-hour round trip. Climbs begin from Donard Park, just minutes from the centre of Newcastle and close to popular pubs and cafes. The mountain is hardly a colossus but it\u2019s a significant challenge and not to be taken lightly, especially given the notoriously unpredictable local weather. At the summit, on a clear day the views over the Irish Sea take in the Isle of Man and the coastlines of Wales and Scotland. Below Donard, the Kilkeel Road hugs the coast south to Bloody Bridge, which derives its name from a massacre during the 1641 Irish Rebellion and is another access point to the Mournes\u2019 activities. There is a campsite here and a public car park where a range of guided walks begin, and it is also the launch point for \u201cwet bouldering\u201d. As the name implies, this is basically a water-based version of traditional bouldering \u2013 rope-free climbing on rock formations \u2013 so as well as clambering up and around huge rocks, you can also expect to be plunging and sliding into the deep pools and waterfalls of the Bloody Bridge River. This is where all the unstoppable water running off the eastern slopes of Donard gathers and meets immovable granite, creating an epic natural water park. Invigorating and inspiring, this is an experience that can be tailored for a range of ages. Or swap freshwater for saltwater and have a go at coasteering. You\u2019ll be on the same side of Donard, but this time leaping from its steep lower reaches into the cold froth of the Irish Sea. There are various levels for this activity, depending on age or nerve. Those short on years or valour should start with the half-day experience at Maggie\u2019s Leap, which also begins at the Bloody Bridge car park. (Evocative place names derived from local folklore are another enduring feature of the Mournes.) To bob on the water rather than plunge into it, sea kayaking trips explore rocky inlets, small stony beaches and caves. Inland, two forest parks offer activity bases. Tollymore is home to Northern Ireland\u2019s National Outdoor Centre, which also has excellent indoor facilities, including a 9.5-metre climbing wall and bouldering area with expert tuition (entry \u00a35, under-14s \u00a32.50, four-evening skills course adult \u00a364, child \u00a340, one-day course \u00a367). Residential packages include canoeing and kayaking on Strangford and Carlingford Loughs, hillwalking, mountain biking, mountaineering and orienteering, and specialist courses such as night navigation for sea kayakers and mountain skills. A few miles away, Life Adventure Centre has made its home in the restored cottages of the old Castlewellan estate, at the edge of the vast forest park above Castlewellan town. Visitors can paddle, pedal, canoe and climb all around the park and much further afield. The centre provides wet bouldering and coasteering trips, but also a huge range of activities on the doorstep: kayaking on the park\u2019s extensive lake, mountain biking on its 30km of mixed ability trails, raft building, archery courses and more (from \u00a315-\u00a329pp). A less physically strenuous but considerably more confounding activity is trying to navigate the centre\u2019s Peace Maze. It\u2019s made up of over two miles of yew hedging, and getting to the centre, where there\u2019s a peace bell to ring, takes most people around 40 minutes. All that activity requires substantial fuel, and the Railway Street Cafe and Brew Bar in the centre of Newcastle offers filling breakfasts of sourdough, poached eggs and bacon, fruit-topped pancakes, and an inventive brunch menu featuring dishes such as salt and chilli king prawns on a bed of Thai slaw drizzled with sriracha mayo. Newcastle is also home to the Soak Seaweed Baths (from \u00a325pp for one hour) \u2013 a novel way to relax after a hard day\u2019s adventuring \u2013 which sustainably harvests local seaweed daily. It\u2019s close to the harbour and the beach, and also offers self-catering Snooze Apartments upstairs (two-night weekend around \u00a3195/\u00a3280 for a one-/two-bedroom apartment, guests receive a 10% discount at the seaweed baths).

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to help you start the week.</p> \n<p>Rights campaigners have described as \u201cutterly chilling\u201d a secret database compiled by counter-terrorism police containing personal information about thousands of people referred to the government\u2019s controversial anti-radicalisation Prevent programme. The Prevent Case Management (PCM) database is accessible to all police forces in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the Home Office is also able to request data from it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/06/counter-terror-police-are-running-secret-prevent-database\">according to documents sent to the human rights group Liberty and seen by the Guardian</a>. Prevent is a voluntary programme which aims to divert people from terrorism before they offend. Up until now it was not known that police could enter details from each Prevent referral into the PCM database, including personal details and reasons for the referral. Gracie Bradley, of Liberty, said it was \u201cutterly chilling that potentially thousands of people, including children, are on a secret government database because of what they\u2019re perceived to think or believe\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Rethink required \u2013 </strong>Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan appears at risk of disintegrating this week after Emmanuel Macron warned that it needed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/06/macron-gives-boris-johnson-end-week-overhaul-brexit-plan\">fundamental revision </a>before there could be any progress towards an agreement. The French president, who refused to meet the prime minister for talks this weekend, gave him until the end of the week to rethink his proposals to overcome the Irish border problem. Pressure heaped on No 10 after its top negotiator, David Frost, was told by EU officials that there will be no last-minute talks at next week\u2019s crunch summit in Brussels. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/06/corbyn-must-lead-any-interim-government-says-shadow-chancellor\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> will meet other opposition leaders today to thrash out how they can ensure that the government adheres to the Benn Act and does not take Britain out of the EU without a deal before the end of the month.

Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons that the disastrous 1960s Beeching rail cuts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/06/without-the-beeching-report-there-might-not-have-been-brexit\">paved the way for our current woes</a>..</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Police failings \u2013 </strong>Only one of the officers referred to the police watchdog for questioning over the disastrous inquiry into a bogus VIP paedophile ring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/06/operation-midland-only-one-officer-spoke-to-watchdog-report\">was interviewed face-to-face</a>. The report from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) into Operation Midland will be released later today and will explain why no police officers will face any action over how they fell for the allegations of child abuse levelled at prominent figures by the fantasist Carl Beech. But the Guardian has learned that two officers referred for investigation over their role could not be forced to be questioned in person because they had retired.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Shutdown threat \u2013 </strong>Extinction Rebellion activists are planning to descend on London from all over the country this morning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/06/extinction-rebellion-fresh-protests-shut-down-westminster\">in an attempt to \u201cshut down\u201d the heart of government</a> with two weeks of disruptive protests.

The iPlayer is destined to become the main way people view BBC programmes but bosses believe it needs to be refreshed to maintain relevance to younger viewers. Five years ago, its share of the streaming market was 40% but this has fallen to 15% in the face of competition from Netflix and Amazon Prime. The changes will transform the \u201clook and feel\u201d of the system and will see shows made available by default for up to a year, rather than 30 days.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Syria withdrawal \u2013 </strong>The White House is pulling its troops out of northern Syria and giving the green light for Turkey to launch an offensive in the area, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-to-let-turkish-forces-move-into-syria-abandoning-kurdish-allies\">abandoning its Kurdish allies</a> to their sworn enemies in Ankara. A statement from the White House said the US was pulling out because it had \u201cdefeated Isis\u201d, and also criticized \u201cFrance, Germany, and other European nations\u201d for not repatriating their citizens who had joined Isis but had since been detained in northern Syria. The surprise decision followed a call between Donald Trump\u2019s and his Turkish his counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and will raise renewed questions about the president\u2019s erratic foreign policy judgment.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b9eada4359dd412dc99b39f2a4c1f2baa5fa4bc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b9eada4359dd412dc99b39f2a4c1f2baa5fa4bc/183_110_2807_1683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Norton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>So \u2018toxic\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Graham Norton has revealed that he quit his agony column for the Daily Telegraph because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/07/toxic-telegraph-made-me-feel-nauseous-says-graham-norton\">he had begun to feel \u201cnauseous\u201d about the newspaper\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d stance</a> on political issues.

Prevent is a voluntary programme which aims to divert people from terrorism before they offend. Up until now it was not known that police could enter details from each Prevent referral into the PCM database, including personal details and reasons for the referral. Gracie Bradley, of Liberty, said it was \u201cutterly chilling that potentially thousands of people, including children, are on a secret government database because of what they\u2019re perceived to think or believe\u201d. * * * Rethink required \u2013 Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan appears at risk of disintegrating this week after Emmanuel Macron warned that it needed fundamental revision before there could be any progress towards an agreement. The French president, who refused to meet the prime minister for talks this weekend, gave him until the end of the week to rethink his proposals to overcome the Irish border problem. Pressure heaped on No 10 after its top negotiator, David Frost, was told by EU officials that there will be no last-minute talks at next week\u2019s crunch summit in Brussels. Jeremy Corbyn will meet other opposition leaders today to thrash out how they can ensure that the government adheres to the Benn Act and does not take Britain out of the EU without a deal before the end of the month. The letters page passes judgment on Corbyn\u2019s chances of success. Britons with serious illnesses who live in the EU say they face a \u201cliving nightmare\u201d over the prospect of not being to access healthcare after Brexit. \u201cIt\u2019s like a death sentence,\u201d said Denise Abel, who moved to Italy in 2012. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons that the disastrous 1960s Beeching rail cuts paved the way for our current woes.. * * * Police failings \u2013 Only one of the officers referred to the police watchdog for questioning over the disastrous inquiry into a bogus VIP paedophile ring was interviewed face-to-face. The report from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) into Operation Midland will be released later today and will explain why no police officers will face any action over how they fell for the allegations of child abuse levelled at prominent figures by the fantasist Carl Beech. But the Guardian has learned that two officers referred for investigation over their role could not be forced to be questioned in person because they had retired. * * * Shutdown threat \u2013 Extinction Rebellion activists are planning to descend on London from all over the country this morning in an attempt to \u201cshut down\u201d the heart of government with two weeks of disruptive protests. Activists plan to blockade roads into Westminster from around 9am today with target areas including Trafalgar Square, Horse Guards Parade, the Mall, Victoria Street, and Westminster and Vauxhall bridges. Leaders of UK XR, as the group is known, also plan to disrupt Smithfield market and the City of London airport during 14 days of protest. One activist, Leo Barasi, writes today that the movement must now ensure \u201cgreen\u201d politicians are forced to adopt concrete policies. * * * Streaming switch \u2013 The BBC is planning a complete revamp of its iPlayer system in the face of competition from streaming services such as Netflix and as traditional scheduled television continues to decline. The iPlayer is destined to become the main way people view BBC programmes but bosses believe it needs to be refreshed to maintain relevance to younger viewers. Five years ago, its share of the streaming market was 40% but this has fallen to 15% in the face of competition from Netflix and Amazon Prime. The changes will transform the \u201clook and feel\u201d of the system and will see shows made available by default for up to a year, rather than 30 days. * * * Syria withdrawal \u2013 The White House is pulling its troops out of northern Syria and giving the green light for Turkey to launch an offensive in the area, abandoning its Kurdish allies to their sworn enemies in Ankara. A statement from the White House said the US was pulling out because it had \u201cdefeated Isis\u201d, and also criticized \u201cFrance, Germany, and other European nations\u201d for not repatriating their citizens who had joined Isis but had since been detained in northern Syria. The surprise decision followed a call between Donald Trump\u2019s and his Turkish his counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and will raise renewed questions about the president\u2019s erratic foreign policy judgment. * * * So \u2018toxic\u2019 \u2013 Graham Norton has revealed that he quit his agony column for the Daily Telegraph because he had begun to feel \u201cnauseous\u201d about the newspaper\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d stance on political issues. The chat show host quit his 12-year stint last year but has not said why until now, revealing that the paper\u2019s position on stories such as Brexit and the US supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh convinced him to walk away. \u201cAbout a year before I left, it took a turn and there were some things in that paper about which I thought, \u2018I cannot be contained within the same pages as this.\u2019\u201d Today in Focus podcast: The strange world of TikTok Our technology editor, Alex Hern, joins Anushka Asthana to discuss how the Chinese-owned social network TikTok has seen massive growth by using shareable short videos set to catchy soundtracks.

Lunchtime read: Latinos in Trump\u2019s America: \u2018It\u2019s my country too\u2019 The El Paso shooting, carried out eight weeks ago by a 21-year-old who parroted Donald Trump\u2019s hate speech about Mexican immigrants, has sent tremors through America\u2019s Hispanic community. They are more wary about where they go, when they do their shopping and how white America sees their place in the country. Dani Anguiano has spoken to Latinos from California to Florida and hears about how racial slurs screamed out of car windows, insults for speaking Spanish in public and school playground \u201cjokes\u201d about building the wall have become commonplace. As one migrant, Lidia Carrillo, says: \u201cIt\u2019s my country too.\u201d Sport Pep Guardiola admitted his Manchester City players were \u201cnervous\u201d as they were beaten by Wolves at the Etihad Stadium thanks to two goals from a former Barcelona player, Adama Traor\u00e9. A bewildered looking David de Gea described Manchester United\u2019s form as \u201cunacceptable\u201d as a 1-0 defeat at Newcastle United left Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side only two points above the relegation zone. Despite a week in which Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson hit the very highest notes, the British team left the World Athletics Championships in Doha with its worst medal tally since 2005. Sebastian Coe says he has not yet read the report that led to Alberto Salazar being banned for four years by the US Anti-Doping Agency \u2013 but insists that athletics does more than most sports to catch drug cheats. Eddie Jones plans to ring the changes against France on Saturday, with England having already qualified for the World Cup quarter-finals. Police say they wrote to Uefa to urge it not to stage England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against Czech Republic in Prague this Friday night, amid fears over drunken and antisocial behaviour from travelling fans. And Phil Neville admitted his team have \u201cgot to be able to perform at home in front of big crowds\u201d after England suffered a bruising 2-1 defeat to Brazil in front of 29,398 spectators at the Riverside. Business HSBC is planning to cut 10,000 jobs across the world, according to the FT, as it struggles with low interest rates, Brexit and the uncertainty over the US-China trade war. It comes weeks after chief executive John Flint quit unexpectedly after 18 months in the top job. Asian markets were relatively calm overnight but the Chinese currency dipped after reports that Beijing will not meet Donald Trump\u2019s trade demands. The FTSE100 is also seen opening flat while the pound is buying $1.233 and \u20ac1.122.

The IMF said Argentina, the second biggest economy in South America, was a special case.</p> <p>But the JDC said Argentina was merely the most acute example of a wider problem, with the IMF also encouraging reckless lending in 17 other countries: Afghanistan; Angola; Cameroon; Central African Republic; Chad; Ecuador; Egypt; Ghana; Jordan; Mauritania; Mongolia; Pakistan; S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe; Sierra Leone; Sri Lanka; Tunisia; and Ukraine. The campaign group said that credit agencies had rated Egypt, Pakistan and Ecuador to be high risk.</p> <p>Sarah-Jayne Clifton, director of Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: \u201cThe IMF has a policy not to lend into an unsustainable debt situation, but we are seeing it breach this policy far too often, bailing out reckless lenders. This creates a moral hazard in the sovereign debt system. Lenders and borrowers are jointly responsible for ensuring debt crises are prevented.</p> <p>\u201cBy constantly bailing out countries in debt crisis without requiring debt restructuring, the IMF is placing the burden of a crisis squarely on the shoulders of the citizens of a debtor country, letting lenders off the hook and ensuring the cycle of debt crises continues.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF defended its approach. A spokesman said: \u201cThe methodology used in the Jubilee report is flawed, starting with the misleading headline number of $93bn. More than half that amount is accounted for by one programme \u2013 Argentina, which has unique circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cThe claim that the IMF\u2019s own rules are being breached is not true. We have clear guidelines about not lending into unsustainable debt situations and all programmes require approval by the IMF\u2019s executive board, representing 189 countries.</p> <p>\u201cThe Jubilee report also shows a lack of understanding of the IMF\u2019s lending policies. Our decisions to lend to countries are not simply based on numerical thresholds, but on comprehensive debt sustainability analyses and policies needed to address economic imbalances and debt burdens.\u201d</p> <p>The JDC said its argument that the IMF should have required a debt restructuring before agreeing to the loan had been supported by the factthat Argentina was now having to restructure the debt a year later. \u201c[The IMF] have a policy not to lend into unsustainable debt situations, and we have presented 18 cases where they are doing exactly that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year\u2019s IMF loan came only two years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/29/argentina-settles-creditor-dispute-deal\">Argentina agreed to repay a proportion of the loans left over from its bankruptcy in 2002</a>, which left $82bn of debts unpaid.</p> <p>The deal with a group of \u201cvulture\u201d hedge funds led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/28/waterstones-paul-singer-elliott-secretive-wizard\">Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management</a> landed Argentina with a $4.6bn bill. The move was expected to clear the way for Argentina to access global debt markets after being excluded for 14 years, but a recovery in the nation\u2019s finances failed to materialise and it was quickly forced again to the edge of bankruptcy.</p> <p>As part of the IMF deal, Argentina agreed to reduce its fiscal deficit to 1.3% of GDP this year, down from 2.2% previously and a balanced budget next year. However, concerns that a general election later this month will oust incumbent president, Mauricio Macri, in favour of the populist Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and his running mate, the former president Cristina de Kirchner, triggered a flight of investors, a run on the currency and sent the interest rate on the country\u2019s publicly traded debts soaring.</p>",

Debt sustainability has come into the spotlight over the past year after the IMF controversially lent a record $56bn to Argentina even though its annual debt repayments far exceeded the Fund\u2019s own limit. The IMF said Argentina, the second biggest economy in South America, was a special case. But the JDC said Argentina was merely the most acute example of a wider problem, with the IMF also encouraging reckless lending in 17 other countries: Afghanistan; Angola; Cameroon; Central African Republic; Chad; Ecuador; Egypt; Ghana; Jordan; Mauritania; Mongolia; Pakistan; S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe; Sierra Leone; Sri Lanka; Tunisia; and Ukraine. The campaign group said that credit agencies had rated Egypt, Pakistan and Ecuador to be high risk. Sarah-Jayne Clifton, director of Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: \u201cThe IMF has a policy not to lend into an unsustainable debt situation, but we are seeing it breach this policy far too often, bailing out reckless lenders. This creates a moral hazard in the sovereign debt system. Lenders and borrowers are jointly responsible for ensuring debt crises are prevented. \u201cBy constantly bailing out countries in debt crisis without requiring debt restructuring, the IMF is placing the burden of a crisis squarely on the shoulders of the citizens of a debtor country, letting lenders off the hook and ensuring the cycle of debt crises continues.\u201d The IMF defended its approach. A spokesman said: \u201cThe methodology used in the Jubilee report is flawed, starting with the misleading headline number of $93bn. More than half that amount is accounted for by one programme \u2013 Argentina, which has unique circumstances. \u201cThe claim that the IMF\u2019s own rules are being breached is not true. We have clear guidelines about not lending into unsustainable debt situations and all programmes require approval by the IMF\u2019s executive board, representing 189 countries. \u201cThe Jubilee report also shows a lack of understanding of the IMF\u2019s lending policies. Our decisions to lend to countries are not simply based on numerical thresholds, but on comprehensive debt sustainability analyses and policies needed to address economic imbalances and debt burdens.\u201d The JDC said its argument that the IMF should have required a debt restructuring before agreeing to the loan had been supported by the factthat Argentina was now having to restructure the debt a year later. \u201c[The IMF] have a policy not to lend into unsustainable debt situations, and we have presented 18 cases where they are doing exactly that.\u201d Last year\u2019s IMF loan came only two years after Argentina agreed to repay a proportion of the loans left over from its bankruptcy in 2002, which left $82bn of debts unpaid. The deal with a group of \u201cvulture\u201d hedge funds led by Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management landed Argentina with a $4.6bn bill. The move was expected to clear the way for Argentina to access global debt markets after being excluded for 14 years, but a recovery in the nation\u2019s finances failed to materialise and it was quickly forced again to the edge of bankruptcy. As part of the IMF deal, Argentina agreed to reduce its fiscal deficit to 1.3% of GDP this year, down from 2.2% previously and a balanced budget next year. However, concerns that a general election later this month will oust incumbent president, Mauricio Macri, in favour of the populist Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and his running mate, the former president Cristina de Kirchner, triggered a flight of investors, a run on the currency and sent the interest rate on the country\u2019s publicly traded debts soaring.",

      "bodyText": "Twenty of the UK\u2019s leading universities have struck a \u00a350m deal to buy renewable energy directly from British windfarms for the first time. The collaborative clean energy deal will supply electricity from wind farms across Scotland and Wales to universities including Newcastle University, University of Exeter and Aberystwyth University. The landmark deal, known as a \u201cpower purchase agreement\u201d or PPA, is the first time that UK public sector energy users have clubbed together to buy clean electricity. The PPA was arranged by deal brokers at The Energy Consortium and Squeaky Clean Energy to fix the price of renewable electricity from a portfolio British windfarms for the next 10 years. The universities will be guaranteed clean energy by the windfarm owner, Norwegian energy giant Statkraft, which will issue certificates matching the output of the windfarms. James Rolfe, the chief operating officer at Anglia Ruskin University, which is part of the deal, said the university has joined others in declaring a climate emergency, and plans to be climate neutral by 2030. \u201cTo support this commitment we aim to source all of our electricity from zero carbon sources by 2025, and this power purchase agreement makes a significant contribution towards this goal whilst delivering financial savings and budget stability,\u201d he added. Richard Murphy, the managing director of The Energy Consortium, said the \u201cgroundbreaking deal\u201d would help universities reduce their carbon emissions and save money by accessing the power purchase market for the first time. Murphy helped arrange one of the first major corporate energy deals in Europe in 2008 to supply supermarket giant with renewable energy. Since then the PPAs have remained the preserve of larger, multi-site corporations because most renewable energy developers require hefty deals over long contract periods, according to Murphy. One of the UK\u2019s largest deals was struck last year between Budweiser brewer AB InBev and solar developer Lightsource BP to build 100MW of solar power, without subsidy, to help power their nationwide operations. Last month, Google revealed the company\u2019s $2bn plans for the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. It is made up of 18 separate agreements to supply Google with 1,600MW of electricity from wind and solar projects across the world. Murphy said that collaborative energy purchase deals mean that even small institutions are now \u201cable to navigate a previously inaccessible market\u201d too. \u201cThe combined challenge facing the wider public sector is to secure reduced carbon emissions whilst saving money and I am delighted that these universities have secured both,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 October 2019 to clarify that this deal was the first between public sector energy users in the UK",

As the MTA purchased a new fleet of silver subway cars, they had to get rid of the old ones, so they threw them into the ocean. \u201cAll these old trains, they hauled them off the coast of Delaware, dumped them into the sea,\u201d recalls Chalfant. \u201cThey hoped they were creating reefs for fish.\u201d This exhibition is a snapshot of life before smartphone-driven culture, a time of offline street community. \u201cThis all happened because these kids used the city,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have an afterschool program, they weren\u2019t sent to classes, they used the city to do what the kids wanted to do, especially urban kids, who wanted to be the best and stick out from the crowd. How did they do that? Style.\u201d In fact, the subway cars were used as a message board for youth culture. \u201cThe trains themselves were a pre-internet thing,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was a great communication device.\u201d Henry Chalfant: Art vs. Transit, 1977-1987 is showing at the Bronx Museum of the Arts until 8 March.",

      "bodyText": "The first time someone called Lidia Carrillo a \u201cwetback\u201d she had to ask her teacher what the slur meant. She was only 13, and had recently moved to California from Jalisco, Mexico, with her parents and six siblings. Carrillo had tried to explain that her family hadn\u2019t crossed any river, but it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cThey looked at us differently,\u201d she recalled. Carrillo, who is now 44 and works for a commercial loan company, would never forget the remark. It stung, as did the sideways glances at her worn white sneakers and the grocery bag in which she carried her textbooks. It was difficult then, Carrillo says. But she doesn\u2019t remember feeling scared, not like she is today, eight weeks after 22 people were killed in the worst hate crime against Latinos in modern US history. \u201cEvery day when I take my daughter to school we pray. I ask God to protect her,\u201d Carrillo said \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to see my daughter or my husband at the end of the day.\u201d For Carrillo and many Latinos across the US, the August violence in El Paso, wrought by a gunman who intended to shoot \u201cas many Mexicans as possible\u201d, marked a day they long feared would come. The killings came less than a week after a gunman, who had previously complained about \u201chordes of mestizos\u201d, shot three people at a food festival in Gilroy, California. And they followed years of belligerent rhetoric by Donald Trump, who launched his presidential campaign in 2015 by calling Mexicans rapists and has directed his administration to crack down on undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers. Hate crimes are up across the United States, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, rising steadily since 2016. Crimes targeting Latinos have increased nearly 80% in California since 2016. In 2018, nearly four out of ten Latinos in the US said they had experienced discrimination in the last year. \u201cThe more that negative stereotypes are accessible and the more that they\u2019re amplified by peer groups or leaders, it\u2019s not unexpected they\u2019ll be acted on,\u201d Levin said. Carrillo and others have changed their lives in subtle ways in response to a country that seems increasingly hostile toward them, forced to reckon not only with deadly violence, but day-to-day harassment: racial slurs screamed out of car windows, and insults for speaking Spanish in public. Ricardo Castillo, who lives in Eustis, Florida, and is originally from Puerto Rico, generally feels safe in his city, but still saves family grocery trips for nighttime when stores are less busy. His family avoids crowded places, and Castillo tries to always be aware of the nearest exit. The El Paso shooting shocked him, but it didn\u2019t surprise him. \u201cThere\u2019s hate out there,\u201d Castillo said. Castillo\u2019s own experience with racial harassment was seen more than 200,000 times on Facebook. A video of two women telling Castillo, the manager of a Burger King, to stop speaking Spanish went viral in July. \u201cGo back to Mexico if you want to keep speaking Spanish,\u201d a woman, seated with another woman in the restaurant, told Castillo. \u201cGo back to your Mexican country.\u201d \u201cGuess what, ma\u2019am? I\u2019m not Mexican,\u201d Castillo responded. \u201cI\u2019m not Mexican, but you\u2019re being very prejudiced and I want you out of my restaurant right now.\u201d Such behavior seems more common and blatant than ever before, said Carlos Romero, who works in student services at a community college in Tucson, Arizona. \u201cI know it was always here in Arizona,\u201d Romero said, citing the state\u2019s efforts to ban ethnic studies in public schools, the \u201cshow your papers\u201d law, and the echoes of former governor Jan Brewer\u2019s rhetoric in Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cBut because of Trump, people are more willing to show that part of themselves now.\u201d The El Paso shooting, perpetrated by a 21-year-old who parroted Trump\u2019s own words, made Romero worry for Latinos across the US, as well as his own family. \u201cIt made me think \u2018what are we going to do now?\u2019 My wife and I talked about whether we need to get passports.\u201d Eight hundred miles away from El Paso in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, Irene Sanchez couldn\u2019t bring herself to leave the house in the days after the shooting. The 36-year-old educator struggled to figure out how to explain the events to her six-year-old son. \u201cI had to explain to him why mommy didn\u2019t feel well,\u201d she recalled. There was this bad man and he went and killed people. There\u2019s certain people who don\u2019t like brown people, she told him. It wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d had such a conversation. They discussed gun violence because of the active shooter drills he participates in at school and they\u2019ve been forced to talk about prejudice, and racism. In kindergarten, the boy had come home from school one afternoon telling her she shouldn\u2019t speak to him in Spanish because he was going to get \u201cpushed over the wall\u201d. Sanchez lived in California in the 1990s, when then-Republican Governor Pete Wilson backed a ballot measure that cut off state services such as healthcare and public education to undocumented immigrants. There was an animosity toward immigrants then, Sanchez recalled, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as this. \u201cThe climate of fear is heightened more than I\u2019ve ever seen it in my life,\u201d she said. Incidents such as the El Paso shooting impact people far beyond those experiencing the violence firsthand, according to Lisseth Rojas-Flores, a clinical psychologist and professor at Fuller Theological Seminary. Mass violence should be thought about like an earthquake, she argued. There is the epicenter, the people directly impacted by the shooting, and there are layers around that: those who live in El Paso, and even further out to people who don\u2019t necessarily have a direct connection to the event or city. \u201cIt still impacts you because it rattles you at your core, especially if you realize they were aiming at Latinos, you ask: \u2018I am Latino what does it mean for me?\u2019\u201d Rojas-Flores said. \u201cI was very troubled by it because I understand the levels of exposure and impact, it keeps on adding to an already anti-immigrant climate. \u201cIt brings to the forefront more fear.\u201d The fear and violence are the results of a president who is openly anti-Latino, said Thomas Saenz, the president of Maldef, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. \u201cThe discrimination is certainly more direct, more open than in my lifetime and certainly emanates from the president of the United States,\u201d Saenz said, adding that Trump\u2019s policies and practices seem, \u201cintent on eliminating the Latino community as an essential part of the country\u201d. Since the shootings, the 13-year-old daughter of Lidia Carrillo won\u2019t wear her Mexican soccer jersey outside the house. \u201cIt could make me a target,\u201d said Adriana Lopez, a ninth-grader who likes skateboarding and reading the bible. The Carrillo family had planned to go to the Gilroy food festival the day of the shooting, but weren\u2019t able to. Thank God, Carrillo thought. For her daughter, coming of age in an era of mass shootings has meant she\u2019s always been worried about such violence, but it\u2019s even harder knowing people who look like her are being targeted. \u201cI always thought this just happened in history, like this stuff didn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d Lopez said.

      "body": "<h2><strong>How did it all start?</strong></h2> <p>To his family\u2019s horror, Alfred Nobel\u2019s last will and testament in 1895 left most of his estate, the equivalent of \u00a3148m in today\u2019s money, to a prize fund. Having amassed a fortune from artillery factories and the invention of dynamite and other explosives, the Swedish businessman had an eye on his legacy.</p> <p>The fund set up five prizes to be awarded annually to those whose work in the preceding year was deemed to \u201chave conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\u201d. He named five prizes: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace.</p> <p>In 1968, a donation from Sweden\u2019s central bank established the Nobel memorial prize for economics, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/08/economics-nobel-women-bailout-stockmarket\" title=\"\">family members argue</a> is not a real Nobel. All are handed out from Sweden apart from the peace prize, which Nobel stipulated without explanation should be awarded from Norway.</p> <h2><strong>How do you win one?</strong></h2> <p>No one can put themselves forward, but each year thousands of professors, members of national academies, Nobel laureates and even parliamentary assemblies lobby the Nobel committees on behalf of their favoured candidates. Nominations open the preceding September and close in January.</p> <p>The Nobel Foundation\u2019s penchant for secrecy ensures that nominees are not revealed for 50 years. Nomination does not ensure success, however. Lise Meitner, who helped split the atom, never received the Nobel prize despite being nominated 48 times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25054676a290a00adc85975b3bf71980750cdf22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25054676a290a00adc85975b3bf71980750cdf22/0_196_3547_4434/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Austrian-Swedish physicist Lise Meitner\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Austrian-Swedish physicist Lise Meitner, pictured in 1927, was nominated 48 times.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ullstein bild via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>What sort of work is rewarded?</strong></h2> <p>Scientists tend to solve big puzzles or develop new technologies. Nobels have been doled out for inventions such as integrated circuits, MRI machines and a host of microscopes, and for discoveries from subatomic particles and the HIV virus to the twisted ladder of DNA and gravitational waves.</p> <p>Serendipity often plays a role: in 1965, Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias feared that pigeon droppings were to blame for the annoying interference that plagued their new radio telescope. They later realised its true origins: the afterglow of the big bang.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18118e836332d37e7e5a8933e44451493dd01bd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18118e836332d37e7e5a8933e44451493dd01bd9/195_200_1165_699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The latest generation of satellite telescopes at a facility on Sierra Negra in Mexico.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The latest generation of satellite telescopes at a facility on Sierra Negra in Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UMass/Umass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Economists will tell you that past performance is no guarantee of future results, and with only one woman having landed the economics prize, one hopes that is true. The award has done a good job of rewarding men who create mathematical models of the world, none of which predicted that major banks would drive themselves into the ground in 2008-09.</p> <p>The literature committee pores over the life\u2019s work of each nominee for evidence that they have brought something new into the world. Humour is rarely rewarded. For Mo Yan, the first Chinese citizen to win the prize, it was \u201challucinatory realism\u201d, while Doris Lessing \u201can epicist of the female experience\u201d subjected \u201ca divided civilisation to scrutiny\u201d. Bob Dylan, author of the line \u201cwiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup\u201d was honoured for creating \u201cnew poetic expressions\u201d.</p> <p>The peace prize is by far the most political Nobel. Unusually, it can be given to entire organisations, with past recipients ranging from the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the European Union. But plenty of individuals have won in their pursuit of peace: Dr Martin Luther King, leader of the civil rights movement; Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the human rights and anti-apartheid activist; and Malala Yousafzai, for her struggle against the suppression of children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8ccaa330f94a6c8d7dd338d77dfbdea2082c346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8ccaa330f94a6c8d7dd338d77dfbdea2082c346/233_239_1443_866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr.Martin Luther King and his wife, Coretta, wait to board a flight to Oslo to collect his peace prize in 1964.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Martin Luther King and his wife, Coretta, wait to board a flight to Oslo to collect his peace prize in 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>How much do you win?</strong></h2> <p>This year, a sole Nobel prize winner will receive 9m kronor (\u00a3743,000). But since most of the prizes are shared between two or three people, the individual winnings can be as low as 2.25m kronor. </p> <p>For some laureates (or their families) the gold medals are more lucrative. In 2014, James Watson became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/dec/09/russian-billionaire-usmanov-james-watson-nobel-prize-return-scientist\" title=\"\">first living laureate to auction his medal</a>. It was bought by Alisher Usmanov, the richest man in Russia, for $4.1m (\u00a33.3m), who then announced he would return the medal to Watson. A year earlier, the family of Francis Crick, who died in 2004, sold his medal for $2.27m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b63870d06fcbf62c190d613449efa5da6e02393b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b63870d06fcbf62c190d613449efa5da6e02393b/199_244_2360_1416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nobel medal awarded to the late Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nobel medal awarded to the late Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Vergara/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>How does it change people\u2019s lives?</strong></h2> <p>Those who win a Nobel are often propelled from a quiet life running a laboratory or writing books to minor celebrity overnight. Invitations to give talks, attend parties and pronounce opinions on a wide variety of topics come flooding in. Some are thrilled to have a platform from which to raise political issues and gain access to politicians, business leaders and the media. For others, this comes as a downside. The Anglo-Dutch laureate Sir Andre Geim joked that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/oct/15/downsides-winning-nobel-prize\" title=\"\">journalists\u2019 questions</a>\u201d were one of the negatives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=What%20do%20Nobel%20winners%20do%20with%20their%20winnings%3F&amp;description=Over%20the%20years%2C%20Nobel%20laureates%20have%20used%20the%20money%20to%20beef%20up%20pension%20pots%2C%20put%20kids%20through%20university%2C%20set%20up%20scholarships%20and%20promote%20campaigns%20to%20combat%20biases%20against%20women%20in%20science.%20%3Cstrong%3EMarie%20and%20Pierre%20Curie%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20put%20their%20own%20considerable%20Nobel%20winnings%20into%20yet%20more%20research.%0A%0AOthers%20literally%20changed%20the%20landscape.%20As%20a%20child%2C%20%3Cstrong%3EG%C3%BCnter%20Blobel%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20(medicine%2C%201999)%20witnessed%20the%20bombing%20of%20Dresden.%20He%20donated%20his%20winnings%20to%20the%20city%20to%20help%20restore%20its%20cathedral%20and%20build%20a%20new%20synagogue.%20Later%2C%20%3Cstrong%3EOrhan%20Pamuk%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20%20(literature%2C%202006)%20spent%20most%20of%20his%20winnings%20building%20the%20Museum%20of%20Innocence%20in%20Istanbul%2C%20after%20his%202008%20novel%20of%20the%20same%20name.%20On%20a%20somewhat%20smaller%20scale%2C%20%3Cstrong%3ERichard%20Roberts%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20(medicine%2C%201993)%20had%20a%20croquet%20lawn%20installed%20at%20his%20home.%0A%0A%3Cstrong%3EFranco%20Modigliani%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20(economics%2C%201985)%20upgraded%20his%20laser%20sailing%20dinghy%2C%20while%20%3Cstrong%3ESir%20Paul%20Nurse%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20(medicine%2C%202001)%2C%20now%20head%20of%20the%20Francis%20Crick%20Institute%20in%20London%2C%20treated%20himself%20to%20a%20Kawasaki%20GPZ%20motorbike.%20He%20later%20swapped%20to%20a%20Triumph%20Bonneville.%0A%0AWhen%20%3Cstrong%3EAlbert%20Einstein%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20won%20the%201921%20Nobel%20prize%20in%20physics%20he%20handed%20over%20the%20much%20of%20the%20winnings%20to%20his%20first%20wife%2C%20%3Cstrong%3EMileva%20Mari%C4%87%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2C%20and%20their%20two%20sons.%0A%0A&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Box\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=What%20do%20Nobel%20winners%20do%20with%20their%20winnings%3F&description=Over%20the%20years%2C%20Nobel%20laureates%20have%20used%20the%20money%20to%20beef%20up%20pension%20pots%2C%20put%20kids%20through%20university%2C%20set%20up%20scholarships%20and%20promote%20campaigns%20to%20combat%20biases%20against%20women%20in%20science.%20%3Cstrong%3EMarie%20and%20Pierre%20Curie%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20put%20their%20own%20considerable%20Nobel%20winnings%20into%20yet%20more%20research.%0A%0AOthers%20literally%20changed%20the%20landscape.%20As%20a%20child%2C%20%3Cstrong%3EG%C3%BCnter%20Blobel%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20(medicine%2C%201999)%20witnessed%20the%20bombing%20of%20Dresden.%20He%20donated%20his%20winnings%20to%20the%20city%20to%20help%20restore%20its%20cathedral%20and%20build%20a%20new%20synagogue.%20Later%2C%20%3Cstrong%3EOrhan%20Pamuk%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20%20(literature%2C%202006)%20spent%20most%20of%20his%20winnings%20building%20the%20Museum%20of%20Innocence%20in%20Istanbul%2C%20after%20his%202008%20novel%20of%20the%20same%20name.%20On%20a%20somewhat%20smaller%20scale%2C%20%3Cstrong%3ERichard%20Roberts%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20(medicine%2C%201993)%20had%20a%20croquet%20lawn%20installed%20at%20his%20home.%0A%0A%3Cstrong%3EFranco%20Modigliani%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20(economics%2C%201985)%20upgraded%20his%20laser%20sailing%20dinghy%2C%20while%20%3Cstrong%3ESir%20Paul%20Nurse%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20(medicine%2C%202001)%2C%20now%20head%20of%20the%20Francis%20Crick%20Institute%20in%20London%2C%20treated%20himself%20to%20a%20Kawasaki%20GPZ%20motorbike.%20He%20later%20swapped%20to%20a%20Triumph%20Bonneville.%0A%0AWhen%20%3Cstrong%3EAlbert%20Einstein%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20won%20the%201921%20Nobel%20prize%20in%20physics%20he%20handed%20over%20the%20much%20of%20the%20winnings%20to%20his%20first%20wife%2C%20%3Cstrong%3EMileva%20Mari%C4%87%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2C%20and%20their%20two%20sons.%0A%0A&link=false\">Box</a> </figure>  <p>Another physics laureate, Brian Schmidt told New Scientist magazine: \u201cOne of the pitfalls of being a Nobel winner is that our voices are too loud when it comes to providing personal opinion \u2013 and in this respect, I need to be far more careful than I used to be about what I say and what I write.\u201d</p> <p>A Nobel may be expected to boost a person\u2019s influence within their own field of expertise, but at least in some cases the reverse seems to occur. One study, which tracked the publication record of 204 Nobel laureates from 1980 to 2009, found that papers published after the award were cited less and published in more lowly journals.</p> <p>Martin Chalfie, who won the chemistry Nobel in 2008, complained that he\u2019d even struggled to recruit students since winning the prize, which he speculated could have been because people were put off by the \u201cinsufferable laureate\u201d stereotype. \u201cThe number of people that apply to the lab, certainly, doesn\u2019t grow and may actually plummet. No one is quite sure why that is,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"071a527629034d3096f1ac2cc46ebc14a27e9afd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/071a527629034d3096f1ac2cc46ebc14a27e9afd/0_50_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mice with the green fluorescent protein\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Chalfie was among a trio to win a Nobel in 2008 for their work on the green fluorescent protein (GFP).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Yeh/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Who are the contenders this year?</strong></h2> <p>After postponing last year\u2019s literature prize following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/04/nobel-prize-for-literature-2018-cancelled-after-sexual-assault-scandal\" title=\"\">sexual assault scandal</a> and a flurry of resignations, the Nobel Academy will hand out two prizes this year. Gerald Murnane, who pulls pints at his golf club in Goroke, 250 miles north-west of Melbourne, must be a contender. But there are plenty more: Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o, the Kenyan author who was jailed for a year without trial in 1978; a slew of Americans from Joyce Carol Oates to Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/11/haruki-murakami-interview-killing-commendatore\" title=\"\">Haruki Murakami</a>, who is always one of the bookies\u2019 favourites.</p> <p>We could see a medicine or chemistry prize for gene editing go to Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuel Charpentier and Feng Zhang. It\u2019s too soon for those behind the Event Horizon Telescope to win the physics prize for the first image of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/sep/05/first-image-black-hole-scientists-awarded-breakthrough-physics-prize\" title=\"\">the point of no return around a black hole</a>. But Alain Aspect and others are in with a chance for their work on quantum entanglement, described by Einstein as \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the US researchers Colin Camerer and George Loewenstein have a shot at the economics prize for their work on behavioural economics and \u201cneuroeconomics\u201d.</p> <p>The 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/14/greta-thunberg-nominated-nobel-peace-prize\" title=\"\">nominated for the peace prize</a>. But unless she was nominated before the January deadline, she cannot be considered for this year\u2019s prize.

Very few women have been recognised over the years. When Donna Strickland was awarded the prize in physics last year, she broke a 54-year exclusively male run and became the third woman to receive it. There have only been five female chemistry winners and it\u2019s alarming that the economics prize, supposedly a modern addition to the gongs, has the worst ratio of female to male winners, with only one woman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/oct/13/elinor-ostrom-nobel-prize-economics\" title=\"\">Elinor Ostrom</a>, winning since 1969. Since 1901, only three women have won the physics prize.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/nobel_gender/giv-3902XkdJnqmcjqgN/\" data-alt=\"Nobel winners by gender\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/nobel_gender/giv-3902XkdJnqmcjqgN/\">Nobel winners by gender</a> </figure>  <p>An argument often wheeled out in discussions about the scarcity of women is that since Nobel prizes are often awarded to people late in their careers, the honours list reflects a time when laboratories were even less diverse than they are today. It is worth noting, that the age of winners has been increasing. Between 1931 and 1940 the average age of physics winner was 41; this decade it has been 68.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/nobel_age/giv-3902DaDwWmTGMpQd/\" data-alt=\"Nobel winners by age\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/nobel_age/giv-3902DaDwWmTGMpQd/\">Nobel winners by age</a> </figure>  <p>There have also been criticisms that the awards have a western bias with the US, Canada and western Europe accounting for more than 81% of the total number of laureates since 1901.

Fibiger discovered a tiny parasitic worm which he concluded caused stomach cancer in rodents, but the animals were later shown to have skin problems caused by vitamin A deficiency. His discovery was considered \u201cthe greatest contribution to experimental medicine\u201d at the time, but later declared \u201cone of the biggest blunders made by the <a href=\"https://ki.se/en\" title=\"\">Karolinska Institute</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Another heavily criticised choice was the 1949 prize in physiology or medicine awarded to the Portuguese neurologist Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz for his development of the prefrontal lobotomy, a procedure that was later discredited and banned \u2013 but only after tens of thousands of patients were subjected to it.</p> <p>There are also prizes that just seem a bit odd in hindsight. Nils Gustaf Dal\u00e9n won the 1912 prize in physics for inventing a new kind of lighthouse valve that automatically switched off the beacon at sunrise. A boon for lighthouse keepers, but a leftfield choice, given that Einstein had just come up with the theory of relativity.</p> <p>The peace prize committee arguably have the hardest task, nominating a person or organisation responsible for \u201cthe most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\u201d. Many criticised as absurdly premature the award to Barack Obama, who was nominated within 12 days of taking office; the 1991 prize to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi\" title=\"\">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> has been mired in controversy after her failure to do anything about the persecution of Rohingya Muslims by Myanmar\u2019s military. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi\" title=\"\">Gandhi</a> never received the Nobel peace prize, although he was nominated five times and decades later, in 2006, a Nobel committee declared this as the organisations \u201cgreatest omission in our 106-year history\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cada1446b9cdd17586a72a4a1693f34f4fb5c42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cada1446b9cdd17586a72a4a1693f34f4fb5c42/0_135_4040_2424/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rohingya refugees gather behind a barbed wire fence in a temporary settlement between Myanmar and Bangladesh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rohingya refugees gather behind a barbed wire fence in a temporary settlement between Myanmar and Bangladesh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ye Aung Thu/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Do the prizes ever cause problems?</strong></h2> <p>There are controversies aplenty. When the then US secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, was awarded the peace prize in 1973, two Norwegian Nobel committee members resigned in protest. Kissinger had ordered a bombing raid of Hanoi while negotiating the ceasefire.</p> <p>The 2010 peace prize award to Chinese writer and human rights activist Liu Xaiobo triggered a diplomatic row between the unamused communist authorities and Norway.</p> <p>The 2008 prize for medicine should have been the German virologist Harald zur Hausen\u2019s finest hour. But the prize, awarded for his discovery that HPV causes cervical cancer, was overshadowed by an anti-corruption investigation by the Swedish police over links between the pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca, which had a major stake in HPV vaccines, and two members of the medicine prize\u2019s selection committee (charges were never brought).</p> <p>The rule of three for the science and economics prizes has been criticised for promoting the myth of the lone genius. There are also those who believe the wrong people who have been recognised. In 2003, the US doctor Raymond Damadian took out full-page adverts in several newspapers over the \u201cshameful\u201d decision to overlook his contributions to developing MRI, which went to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lauterbur\" title=\"\">Paul Lauterbur</a> and Sir Peter Mansfield. Others are more philosophical. Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who was overlooked for her discovery of quasars, told the Guardian she felt she had \u201cdone very well out of not getting a Nobel prize\u201d because she had won another award almost every year since, which is \u201cmuch more fun\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72a00f920d7e4e153e237bef39344d82b257ca2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72a00f920d7e4e153e237bef39344d82b257ca2b/0_0_6192_4128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Last year\u2019s Nobel prize banquet in the Stockholm\u2019s City Hall, Sweden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last year\u2019s Nobel prize banquet in the Stockholm\u2019s City Hall, Sweden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>What happens at the ceremony?</strong></h2> <p>Think pomp, royals and a touch of madness. The prizes are presented to winners on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel\u2019s death. The science, literature and economics prizes are handed out by the King of Sweden in Stockholm, while the chair of the Norwegian Nobel committee awards the peace prize in Oslo.</p> <p>With diplomas and medals in hand, the freshly minted laureates head off to a banquet. Cue tooting trumpets, vigorous organ playing, toasts, music, dance, speeches, gallons of champagne and plates bearing such items as turbot cupolas, pumpkin gel, guinea hen mosaics, watercress foam, potato pithiviers, clouds of fruit and deep fried rice paper.</p> <p>In case time drags, there is plenty of entertainment. Last year the Royal Swedish Ballet, Opera and Orchestra performed four acts on the theme of courage. In 2015, the Swedish singer Anna Ternheim sang about loneliness to the accompaniment of a string octet and a saw, followed by another singer joined by a man with a laser harp.</p> <p>In 2012, it was the acrobats who stole the show. Cirkus Cirk\u00f6rperformed three acts which found their way to the question: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/ceremonies/the-nobel-banquet-2012-2012-2/\" title=\"\">Is it possible to knit peace</a>?\u201d It certainly is, according to the banquet programme. \u201cOne person is never too small to be part of a world-wide knitting for peace,\u201d it declares.</p>",

      "bodyText": "How did it all start? To his family\u2019s horror, Alfred Nobel\u2019s last will and testament in 1895 left most of his estate, the equivalent of \u00a3148m in today\u2019s money, to a prize fund. Having amassed a fortune from artillery factories and the invention of dynamite and other explosives, the Swedish businessman had an eye on his legacy. The fund set up five prizes to be awarded annually to those whose work in the preceding year was deemed to \u201chave conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\u201d. He named five prizes: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. In 1968, a donation from Sweden\u2019s central bank established the Nobel memorial prize for economics, which family members argue is not a real Nobel. All are handed out from Sweden apart from the peace prize, which Nobel stipulated without explanation should be awarded from Norway. How do you win one? No one can put themselves forward, but each year thousands of professors, members of national academies, Nobel laureates and even parliamentary assemblies lobby the Nobel committees on behalf of their favoured candidates. Nominations open the preceding September and close in January. The Nobel Foundation\u2019s penchant for secrecy ensures that nominees are not revealed for 50 years. Nomination does not ensure success, however. Lise Meitner, who helped split the atom, never received the Nobel prize despite being nominated 48 times. What sort of work is rewarded? Scientists tend to solve big puzzles or develop new technologies. Nobels have been doled out for inventions such as integrated circuits, MRI machines and a host of microscopes, and for discoveries from subatomic particles and the HIV virus to the twisted ladder of DNA and gravitational waves. Serendipity often plays a role: in 1965, Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias feared that pigeon droppings were to blame for the annoying interference that plagued their new radio telescope. They later realised its true origins: the afterglow of the big bang. Economists will tell you that past performance is no guarantee of future results, and with only one woman having landed the economics prize, one hopes that is true. The award has done a good job of rewarding men who create mathematical models of the world, none of which predicted that major banks would drive themselves into the ground in 2008-09. The literature committee pores over the life\u2019s work of each nominee for evidence that they have brought something new into the world. Humour is rarely rewarded. For Mo Yan, the first Chinese citizen to win the prize, it was \u201challucinatory realism\u201d, while Doris Lessing \u201can epicist of the female experience\u201d subjected \u201ca divided civilisation to scrutiny\u201d. Bob Dylan, author of the line \u201cwiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup\u201d was honoured for creating \u201cnew poetic expressions\u201d. The peace prize is by far the most political Nobel. Unusually, it can be given to entire organisations, with past recipients ranging from the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the European Union. But plenty of individuals have won in their pursuit of peace: Dr Martin Luther King, leader of the civil rights movement; Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the human rights and anti-apartheid activist; and Malala Yousafzai, for her struggle against the suppression of children. How much do you win? This year, a sole Nobel prize winner will receive 9m kronor (\u00a3743,000). But since most of the prizes are shared between two or three people, the individual winnings can be as low as 2.25m kronor. For some laureates (or their families) the gold medals are more lucrative. In 2014, James Watson became the first living laureate to auction his medal. It was bought by Alisher Usmanov, the richest man in Russia, for $4.1m (\u00a33.3m), who then announced he would return the medal to Watson. A year earlier, the family of Francis Crick, who died in 2004, sold his medal for $2.27m. How does it change people\u2019s lives? Those who win a Nobel are often propelled from a quiet life running a laboratory or writing books to minor celebrity overnight. Invitations to give talks, attend parties and pronounce opinions on a wide variety of topics come flooding in. Some are thrilled to have a platform from which to raise political issues and gain access to politicians, business leaders and the media. For others, this comes as a downside. The Anglo-Dutch laureate Sir Andre Geim joked that \u201cjournalists\u2019 questions\u201d were one of the negatives. Another physics laureate, Brian Schmidt told New Scientist magazine: \u201cOne of the pitfalls of being a Nobel winner is that our voices are too loud when it comes to providing personal opinion \u2013 and in this respect, I need to be far more careful than I used to be about what I say and what I write.\u201d A Nobel may be expected to boost a person\u2019s influence within their own field of expertise, but at least in some cases the reverse seems to occur. One study, which tracked the publication record of 204 Nobel laureates from 1980 to 2009, found that papers published after the award were cited less and published in more lowly journals. Martin Chalfie, who won the chemistry Nobel in 2008, complained that he\u2019d even struggled to recruit students since winning the prize, which he speculated could have been because people were put off by the \u201cinsufferable laureate\u201d stereotype. \u201cThe number of people that apply to the lab, certainly, doesn\u2019t grow and may actually plummet. No one is quite sure why that is,\u201d he said. Who are the contenders this year? After postponing last year\u2019s literature prize following a sexual assault scandal and a flurry of resignations, the Nobel Academy will hand out two prizes this year. Gerald Murnane, who pulls pints at his golf club in Goroke, 250 miles north-west of Melbourne, must be a contender. But there are plenty more: Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o, the Kenyan author who was jailed for a year without trial in 1978; a slew of Americans from Joyce Carol Oates to Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon, and Haruki Murakami, who is always one of the bookies\u2019 favourites. We could see a medicine or chemistry prize for gene editing go to Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuel Charpentier and Feng Zhang. It\u2019s too soon for those behind the Event Horizon Telescope to win the physics prize for the first image of the point of no return around a black hole. But Alain Aspect and others are in with a chance for their work on quantum entanglement, described by Einstein as \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d. Meanwhile, the US researchers Colin Camerer and George Loewenstein have a shot at the economics prize for their work on behavioural economics and \u201cneuroeconomics\u201d. The 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg has been nominated for the peace prize. But unless she was nominated before the January deadline, she cannot be considered for this year\u2019s prize. Pope Francis is in with a chance. Is there a diversity problem? The statistics don\u2019t look good. Very few women have been recognised over the years. When Donna Strickland was awarded the prize in physics last year, she broke a 54-year exclusively male run and became the third woman to receive it. There have only been five female chemistry winners and it\u2019s alarming that the economics prize, supposedly a modern addition to the gongs, has the worst ratio of female to male winners, with only one woman, Elinor Ostrom, winning since 1969. Since 1901, only three women have won the physics prize. An argument often wheeled out in discussions about the scarcity of women is that since Nobel prizes are often awarded to people late in their careers, the honours list reflects a time when laboratories were even less diverse than they are today. It is worth noting, that the age of winners has been increasing. Between 1931 and 1940 the average age of physics winner was 41; this decade it has been 68. There have also been criticisms that the awards have a western bias with the US, Canada and western Europe accounting for more than 81% of the total number of laureates since 1901. Africa is the region with the fewest \u2013 just 17, of which only seven were outside South Africa. More men called John have won Nobels than have Africans. Have any awards turned out to be misjudged? One of the most clearcut cases is Johannes Fibiger, who won the 1926 prize in medicine \u201cfor his discovery of the Spiroptera carcinoma\u201d. Fibiger discovered a tiny parasitic worm which he concluded caused stomach cancer in rodents, but the animals were later shown to have skin problems caused by vitamin A deficiency. His discovery was considered \u201cthe greatest contribution to experimental medicine\u201d at the time, but later declared \u201cone of the biggest blunders made by the Karolinska Institute\u201d. Another heavily criticised choice was the 1949 prize in physiology or medicine awarded to the Portuguese neurologist Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz for his development of the prefrontal lobotomy, a procedure that was later discredited and banned \u2013 but only after tens of thousands of patients were subjected to it. There are also prizes that just seem a bit odd in hindsight. Nils Gustaf Dal\u00e9n won the 1912 prize in physics for inventing a new kind of lighthouse valve that automatically switched off the beacon at sunrise. A boon for lighthouse keepers, but a leftfield choice, given that Einstein had just come up with the theory of relativity. The peace prize committee arguably have the hardest task, nominating a person or organisation responsible for \u201cthe most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\u201d. Many criticised as absurdly premature the award to Barack Obama, who was nominated within 12 days of taking office; the 1991 prize to Aung San Suu Kyi has been mired in controversy after her failure to do anything about the persecution of Rohingya Muslims by Myanmar\u2019s military. Gandhi never received the Nobel peace prize, although he was nominated five times and decades later, in 2006, a Nobel committee declared this as the organisations \u201cgreatest omission in our 106-year history\u201d. Do the prizes ever cause problems? There are controversies aplenty. When the then US secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, was awarded the peace prize in 1973, two Norwegian Nobel committee members resigned in protest. Kissinger had ordered a bombing raid of Hanoi while negotiating the ceasefire. The 2010 peace prize award to Chinese writer and human rights activist Liu Xaiobo triggered a diplomatic row between the unamused communist authorities and Norway. The 2008 prize for medicine should have been the German virologist Harald zur Hausen\u2019s finest hour. But the prize, awarded for his discovery that HPV causes cervical cancer, was overshadowed by an anti-corruption investigation by the Swedish police over links between the pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca, which had a major stake in HPV vaccines, and two members of the medicine prize\u2019s selection committee (charges were never brought). The rule of three for the science and economics prizes has been criticised for promoting the myth of the lone genius. There are also those who believe the wrong people who have been recognised. In 2003, the US doctor Raymond Damadian took out full-page adverts in several newspapers over the \u201cshameful\u201d decision to overlook his contributions to developing MRI, which went to Paul Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield. Others are more philosophical. Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who was overlooked for her discovery of quasars, told the Guardian she felt she had \u201cdone very well out of not getting a Nobel prize\u201d because she had won another award almost every year since, which is \u201cmuch more fun\u201d. What happens at the ceremony? Think pomp, royals and a touch of madness. The prizes are presented to winners on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel\u2019s death. The science, literature and economics prizes are handed out by the King of Sweden in Stockholm, while the chair of the Norwegian Nobel committee awards the peace prize in Oslo. With diplomas and medals in hand, the freshly minted laureates head off to a banquet. Cue tooting trumpets, vigorous organ playing, toasts, music, dance, speeches, gallons of champagne and plates bearing such items as turbot cupolas, pumpkin gel, guinea hen mosaics, watercress foam, potato pithiviers, clouds of fruit and deep fried rice paper. In case time drags, there is plenty of entertainment. Last year the Royal Swedish Ballet, Opera and Orchestra performed four acts on the theme of courage. In 2015, the Swedish singer Anna Ternheim sang about loneliness to the accompaniment of a string octet and a saw, followed by another singer joined by a man with a laser harp. In 2012, it was the acrobats who stole the show. Cirkus Cirk\u00f6rperformed three acts which found their way to the question: \u201cIs it possible to knit peace?\u201d It certainly is, according to the banquet programme. \u201cOne person is never too small to be part of a world-wide knitting for peace,\u201d it declares.",

      "bodyText": "An expanding far right has transformed itself into loose networks of online sympathisers who share and produce extremist material fuelled by toxic mainstream political rhetoric, experts have warned. These networks attempt to generate interest using messaging apps, social media and platforms such as Telegram, 8chan and Gab, with some openly supportive of Boris Johnson and his stated aim of taking the UK out of the European Union by the end of October. James Goddard, a self-styled yellow vest protester, encouraged people to join him outside the Conservative party conference in Manchester this week, in opposition to what he called the \u201cunwashed, anti-democratic fanatical remainers\u201d before signing off with the hashtag #BackBoris. A rambling video on his Telegram and YouTube channels, which have a combined total of 17,000 subscribed accounts, shows him repeatedly harangue pro-EU protesters, calling them \u201ctraitors\u201d and accusing them of \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d \u2013 a language reflecting recent debates in the Commons. The so-called Tommy Robinson News channel on Telegram endorsed Johnson in early September, praising him for stripping the Conservative whip from 21 MPs for refusing to back no deal. \u201cIt is refreshing to see someone have a pair and stand up for British democracy,\u201d the posting begins, referring to the \u201c21 Tory traitors\u201d who voted with Labour. \u201cWe back Boris, now get us out of the EU\u201d. Researcher Jacob Davey, at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue thinktank, said: \u201cThere\u2019s clearly been a response to Boris Johnson and some of the rhetoric from his government in far right circles. It has stimulated them.\u201d Johnson was embroiled in heated exchanges in the Commons last week, when he dismissed as \u201chumbug\u201d pleas from Labour MP Paula Sherriff to stop describing the Benn act as the \u201csurrender bill\u201d. Sherriff had said that death threats to MPs often quoted Johnson\u2019s words, such as \u201c\u2018surrender act\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019\u201d and she had called on him to \u201cmoderate his language\u201d. Pro-remain MP Dominic Grieve said that he had received a death threat this weekend, after the Mail on Sunday quoted a government spokesman saying that he and the two other MPs who had drawn up the bill to prevent a no deal Brexit were under investigation over whether they had been \u201cengaged in collusion with foreign powers\u201d. \u201cThe direct consequence,\u201d Grieve said, \u201cwas a death threat as I came up on the train [to Conservative party conference]. There is a direct causal link between the two, indeed the death threat came accompanied by the Mail on Sunday article.\u201d Joe Mulhall, a senior researcher at Hope Not Hate, which monitors the far right, described the model as \u201cpost-organisational\u201d and said he believed one goal was to expand what is known as the \u201cOverton window\u201d, the range of ideas tolerated in public debate. \u201cSome of the language we see more widely now, such as \u2018traitors\u2019 and \u2018betrayal\u2019, this is absolutely the language of the far right,\u201d he said. Entry-level groups, such as the Tommy Robinson channel, which has 50,700 subscribed accounts, act as gateways for like-minded individuals to connect online, with the next step for some being to join closed chat groups and sharing material. Brexit is not the only issue to interest far-right supporters: other dominant themes are anti-Muslim hatred, white supremacism or cultural nationalism. Ideas are spread internationally, most notably the conspiracy theory of the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d, which is based on the false claim that so-called indigenous European people will be outnumbered by Muslims. Typically people are asked to prove their belief in order to join a closed group by photographing themselves with Nazi regalia or far-right texts, or asked to undertake a simple task such as distributing fascistic or anti-Muslim leaflets. Individuals joining such groups tend to be male, aged 15 to 25, and show some level of technological sophistication, using encrypted communications and trying to hide their true identities online. Direct incitement is rare but a pressing concern is whether individuals could become radicalised, \u201clone actors\u201d such as Thomas Mair, the reclusive, white supremacist who assassinated Labour MP Jo Cox, or Darren Osborne, who was found guilty of murder after driving a van into a crowd of Muslims near a London mosque.

We\u2019re not going to have mention of individual brands in those cards or individual billionaires. Because we\u2019re worried about the potential damage to Sony\u2019s corporate relations with these brands.\u201d</p> <p>Winterbottom took note. Replacement cards were made and test-screened. These, too, he says, went down well with everyone except Kline.

We meet a couple of times, once at the Guardian offices, where he could easily pass for a foreign editor, and once for coffee, near his home. In fact, for 58, Winterbottom is quite mumbly, self-effacing and averse to talking personally \u2013 not just about his private life (he lives with his producer, Melissa Parmenter, and their eight-year-old son, Jack; he also has two daughters, Ruth and Anna, from a previous marriage), but his own ethical negotiations (he eventually tells me his trousers are from sustainable tailor Oliver Spencer). He\u2019s also relaxed, fast to laugh \u2013 and evidently livid within.</p> <p>Does he regret not tooth-combing the paperwork? \u201cAs a director, I don\u2019t really get too bogged down in legal contracts. Obviously, on reflection, it would have been good to know.</p> <p>\u201cBut I did a film 20 years ago, structured the exact same way, in which Film4 split the finance 50/50 with Miramax, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/harvey-weinstein\">Harvey Weinstein</a> was at his most bullish. At that point Film4 seemed to have as much say and clout determining the content as Miramax. But in this case it was just like: well, sorry, we don\u2019t agree with Sony, but you\u2019ve got to take the credits out.\u201d</p> <p>Sony declines to comment, but Film4\u2019s defence rests on the reminder that Winterbottom signed an agreement which \u201cstated that if any creative or business discussions reached a deadlock, Sony\u2019s view would prevail.

      "bodyText": "Every year for the past three decades, Michael Winterbottom has made a movie. Britain\u2019s most mercurial director may have hopped between genres like a frog on a bouncy castle, but he has stuck to a strict schedule \u2013 inspired, apparently, by the subject of his first film, Ingmar Bergman. (Bergman only agreed to the documentary because he was so tickled by the then 25-year-old\u2019s surname. \u201cIt\u2019s the one time it\u2019s been a help,\u201d says Winterbottom. \u201cAs a child, it wasn\u2019t the easiest.\u201d) Now, abruptly, that routine has changed. Winterbottom is on sabbatical. To recover, it turns out, from the past six months, spent unsuccessfully haggling over the final cut of his latest film. Greed is a boisterous satire largely set during the lavish 60th birthday party in Mykonos (Coldplay, newly built amphitheatre, lion) of a British fashion mogul with deep tan and alarming teeth, based heavily on Philip Green. Steve Coogan stars; David Mitchell plays a journalist roped into writing his biography, who travels to the far east to tour the factories which manufacture the clothes that have made his subject so rich. The original version of the film ended with a series of cards spelling out how real life is yet more grotesque than fiction. How workers in Myanmar and Bangladesh earn $3.60 and $2.84 a day making clothes for British high street brands, while H&amp;M\u2019s owner, Stefan Persson, is worth around $18bn and Zara\u2019s owner, Amancio Ortega, $67bn. At the first test screening in March, reports Winterbottom, these cards were a big hit. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t find the message annoying, they loved it. But, unfortunately, we were told we couldn\u2019t put them in the film.\u201d This was the decree, he says, of Laine Kline, head of Sony Pictures International, which co-financed Greed with Film4 and is distributing it worldwide. \u201cHe was like: I don\u2019t care it\u2019s the most popular bit. We\u2019re not going to have mention of individual brands in those cards or individual billionaires. Because we\u2019re worried about the potential damage to Sony\u2019s corporate relations with these brands.\u201d Winterbottom took note. Replacement cards were made and test-screened. These, too, he says, went down well with everyone except Kline. The director dug his heels in, but he was standing on quicksand: the final say rested not, as he imagined, with himself, or with frequent collaborator Film4, but entirely with Sony. Winterbottom does not appear an especially angry man. We meet a couple of times, once at the Guardian offices, where he could easily pass for a foreign editor, and once for coffee, near his home. In fact, for 58, Winterbottom is quite mumbly, self-effacing and averse to talking personally \u2013 not just about his private life (he lives with his producer, Melissa Parmenter, and their eight-year-old son, Jack; he also has two daughters, Ruth and Anna, from a previous marriage), but his own ethical negotiations (he eventually tells me his trousers are from sustainable tailor Oliver Spencer). He\u2019s also relaxed, fast to laugh \u2013 and evidently livid within. Does he regret not tooth-combing the paperwork? \u201cAs a director, I don\u2019t really get too bogged down in legal contracts. Obviously, on reflection, it would have been good to know. \u201cBut I did a film 20 years ago, structured the exact same way, in which Film4 split the finance 50/50 with Miramax, when Harvey Weinstein was at his most bullish. At that point Film4 seemed to have as much say and clout determining the content as Miramax. But in this case it was just like: well, sorry, we don\u2019t agree with Sony, but you\u2019ve got to take the credits out.\u201d Sony declines to comment, but Film4\u2019s defence rests on the reminder that Winterbottom signed an agreement which \u201cstated that if any creative or business discussions reached a deadlock, Sony\u2019s view would prevail. Editorial discussions between partners are part and parcel of independent film-making and usually resolved in the cutting room. Film4 always back our film-makers and are very proud of the finished film of Greed.\u201d Still, there\u2019s a troubling muddle here. It\u2019s true that the original script of Greed did not detail the content of these end cards, instead saying it would \u201cgo to a documentary sequence\u201d. \u201cWe talked about it,\u201d says Winterbottom, \u201cbut hadn\u2019t actually written down the facts and figures because they always change.\u201d And the entire pitch of the film is an upfront expos\u00e9 of wealth inequality that does name and shame real-life brand owners in a scene which was in the original script, when Coogan\u2019s character appears before a select committee. Winterbottom has a platform to hammer home the facts: last month he read many of them out on stage after the film\u2019s Toronto premiere \u2013 attended, of course, by studio bigwigs. \u201cNo one died of shock,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one is going to be, like: \u2018Oh my God, Sony is releasing a film that mentions the fact Ortega is worth $60bn.\u2019 It\u2019s just public knowledge. In fact, it shows he\u2019s been a success.\u201d So why whistleblow? Does he think Sony might reconsider? \u201cWell, that would be good. The impact of the film was bigger when we were being more specific, more dynamic, more impactful, more clear. But I\u2019m not expecting them to.\u201d I think Winterbottom feels compelled to spill the beans because what happened so offends his sense of justice. On principle, he says, a publicly owned British company with public service remit shouldn\u2019t sign over control of a British story to a multinational. He\u2019s also exercised about what he sees as a betrayal of the 2007 tax credit system agreement between Film4, BBC Films and the BFI to support British independent film-makers. In the case of Greed, half those benefits have gone to Sony. \u201cThat seems to me to be wrong.\u201d The consistent beat in Winterbottom\u2019s career \u2013 louder even than sex or pop or celebrity \u2013 is iconoclasm: banging the drum for the man morally wronged by an institution. It just so happens this is the first time he feels it\u2019s happened to him. Born in Blackburn in 1961, Winterbottom\u2019s mother was a teacher, his father a draftsman in the factory where A Kind of Loving was shot. After university, he worked as an assistant for Lindsay Anderson (whose memoirs describe him as \u201cattractively cherubic\u201d).

These days, the main question he says he\u2019s asked at festivals is when the next Trip is out. Six months after finishing Greed, Coogan and Winterbottom returned to Greece to shoot a fourth instalment of the comedy in which Coogan and Rob Brydon irritate each other over tasting menus. Winterbottom tells me gleefully about a scene involving the same real-life refugee who features in Greed (as a troublesome blight on the beach), and who, in The Trip to Greece, Coogan apparently fails to recognise.

Guests, Winterbottom reminds me, have included Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Gwyneth Paltrow and that beacon of eco-consciousness, Leonardo DiCaprio. Sony, unsurprisingly, said no to those too. Its refusal, says Winterbottom, fatally blunts a tale he made for its sting: \u201cYou want to make people feel angry and frustrated and to want change.\u201d He zips up his cardie and heads back to his sabbatical, unfussed by the bridges burning behind him. \u2022 Greed opens in the UK in February; its European premiere is on 9 October at the London film festival.",

The prosecution of David Duckenfield, 75, will be heard at Preston crown court, presided over by Judge Sir Peter Openshaw, who heard the previous trial that concluded in April. When the match took place on 15 April 1989 between Liverpool, then managed by Kenny Dalglish, and Brian Clough\u2019s Nottingham Forest, Duckenfield was 44, newly promoted from the rank of superintendent to be in charge of the South Yorkshire police crowd safety operation.

Partly they\u2019re preparing for the cold weeks ahead; partly, and of course without meaning to, they\u2019re helping the woodland replenish itself once again. Many of the cached acorns will go unrecovered, and some, eventually, will germinate. This broadleaf sprawl just south of central Leeds is one of the biggest semi-natural woodlands in the county, and oak is its mainstay species; the squirrels and jays help sustain the chugging of the forest\u2019s ancient engine. There has always been treasure under the ground here at Middleton. The paths I walk wind through the remains of old coalmines, sunk beneath the oak-roots in the early 1700s. You can still see the shaft openings among the trees \u2013 still see, even, the weary circles trodden in the soil by the ponies whose labour drove the pit engines. There\u2019s one place I know of where you can kick the topsoil and send fragments of coal skittering into the pit hollow.",

      "bodyText": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has disclosed that he suffers from an autoimmune disease that can potentially have serious complications, the latest condition for a leader whose health has been subject to speculation. Duterte, 74, was the oldest person to be elected president of the country and questions about his health have swirled since taking office in 2016, with speculation driven by the president occasionally skipping events and meetings, as well as discussing his health. Duterte revealed the condition, myasthenia gravis, at an appearance before the Philippine community late Saturday during a visit to Russia. \u201cOne of my eyes is smaller. It roams on its own,\u201d he said, according to a transcript released Sunday by his office. \u201cThat\u2019s myasthenia gravis. It\u2019s a nerve malfunction. I got it from my grandfather.\u201d The condition causes muscle weakness, and can result in drooping of eyelids, blurred vision as well as weakness in one\u2019s extremities, according to the US National Institutes of Health. The condition can generally be managed with treatment, but up to 20% of people who have the disease experience at least one \u201ccrisis\u201d that requires them to use a ventilator to help breathe, the NIH said. Duterte gave no indication as to whether he has had any serious incidents as a result of the disease. His administration gives out very little information about his health and consistently says the president is in good shape. Duterte himself, however, has discussed his ailments in his frequent, rambling speeches. In October 2018 he told an audience how he was awaiting the results of a cancer screening. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m now physically, but I have to wait for that,\u201d Duterte said last October. \u201cBut, I will tell you if its cancer, it\u2019s cancer. If it\u2019s third stage, no more treatment. I will not prolong the agony in this office or anywhere.\u201d His comments sparked immediate concern and speculation, but days later he said the tests had come back negative. Duterte has also said previously that he suffers from daily migraines and ailments including Buerger\u2019s disease, an illness that affects the veins and the arteries of the limbs, and is usually due to smoking. He has cited his ill health as the reason for skipping events during summits abroad. The president, known for his deadly crackdown on drugs, also revealed in 2016 that he used to take fentanyl, a powerful painkiller, because of a spinal injury from motorcycle accidents.",

And it often goes so much deeper than exchanging shallow pleasantries.</p> <p>A casual enquiry of \u201chow\u2019s your day been?\u201d at the supermarket can be greeted with unhurried tales of a mother just admitted to a hospice, a baby who won\u2019t sleep or a husband who has been posted overseas for too long.</p> <p>Trying to catch up on your emails in a taxi is fruitless, because the driver will want to know who you are, where you\u2019re from, what you do and why you\u2019re here. Not engaging makes me uncomfortable and is considered socially rude; a display that this person is <em>not </em>entitled to your time and attention.</p> <p>When in New Zealand \u2013 they are.</p> <p>We are small here and the population is not large. Isolation and loneliness are more pressing issues than overcrowding. The latest census shows more people are living alone than ever before, and young people are single for longer, while older groups might be widowed and no longer in the workforce or easily mobile.</p> <p>Chat isn\u2019t just chat in New Zealand, it\u2019s connection, possibly the only social interaction of a person\u2019s day, if they are isolated, out of work or lonely. I have been all of those things, and I have valued casual exchanges as proof that I\u2019m still human, still worth talking too, when my feelings and mind seem to be telling me otherwise.</p> <p>Early immigrants to Australia and New Zealand were often attracted by the prospect of a more egalitarian, classless society \u2013 a society where the prime minister shares a cup of tea with the plumber. (Though in Jacinda Ardern\u2019s case, she<a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11816473\"> actually does her own plumbing</a>). It\u2019s not true to say New Zealand has achieved this ideal.

A casual enquiry of \u201chow\u2019s your day been?\u201d at the supermarket can be greeted with unhurried tales of a mother just admitted to a hospice, a baby who won\u2019t sleep or a husband who has been posted overseas for too long. Trying to catch up on your emails in a taxi is fruitless, because the driver will want to know who you are, where you\u2019re from, what you do and why you\u2019re here. Not engaging makes me uncomfortable and is considered socially rude; a display that this person is not entitled to your time and attention. When in New Zealand \u2013 they are. We are small here and the population is not large. Isolation and loneliness are more pressing issues than overcrowding. The latest census shows more people are living alone than ever before, and young people are single for longer, while older groups might be widowed and no longer in the workforce or easily mobile. Chat isn\u2019t just chat in New Zealand, it\u2019s connection, possibly the only social interaction of a person\u2019s day, if they are isolated, out of work or lonely. I have been all of those things, and I have valued casual exchanges as proof that I\u2019m still human, still worth talking too, when my feelings and mind seem to be telling me otherwise. Early immigrants to Australia and New Zealand were often attracted by the prospect of a more egalitarian, classless society \u2013 a society where the prime minister shares a cup of tea with the plumber. (Though in Jacinda Ardern\u2019s case, she actually does her own plumbing). It\u2019s not true to say New Zealand has achieved this ideal. But it may be more true here, more of the time, than for many of our western neighbours. After a month in Europe, we flew back to New Zealand, back to work and early nights and pets. As I stood in the duty-free shop, browsing the bottles of whisky, a ruddy-faced Otago farmer ambled up. \u201cPhew!\u201d he said. \u201cHow good is that fresh snow?\u201d For a moment, I baulked. Did I know this man, this middle-aged farmer in a checked shirt and crushed baseball cap? Had I forgotten his face? As he chatted on, I realised we were strangers. Strangers talking about the melting glaciers up the west coast. Strangers swapping details of the terrible meals we\u2019d eaten onboard. Strangers who had time for each other, who weren\u2019t in a hurry \u2013 who were home. Eventually, he wandered off, fetched by his wife who\u2019d finished her shopping. My partner approached, a bemused look on his face. Did you know him, then? \u201cNo,\u201d I replied, grinning. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him at all.\u201d",

In a submission to a Senate inquiry into welfare allowance payments, KPMG said the current rate was too low to help people meet their material needs, such as eating to a healthy standard, keeping a roof over their heads, maintaining clothes for interviews and travelling to Centrelink appointments. An increase would benefit the economy by stimulating spending, particularly in regional areas, the firm said, because Newstart recipients \u201cspend, rather than save, almost all they receive\u201d. To avoid what it called a \u201csocially damaging state of affairs,\u201d KPMG said the government should raise Newstart to 50% of the minimum wage and 80% of the age pension. \u201cBased on this, Newstart should increase to $370 per week for a single person with no dependents,\u201d the accounting firm said of the dole, which is currently $279.50 a week.

The accounting firm Deloitte, which modelled the $75 increase, has also backed an increase to the dole, as has the former prime minister John Howard. The KPMG proposal put the cost of a $100 a week increase to Newstart at $3bn to $3.5bn per annum, but argued such a rise would \u201cstill allow room for a significant financial incentive for moving into even the lowest-paid work for three or more days per week\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Defence barrister Tim Marsh has a philosophical bent. A plea hearing is not a search for truth, he told the Victorian supreme court, but it is a search for an explanation. It was his task to explain why Codey Herrmann, aged 20, with no prior convictions and no history of violence, would viciously bash a young woman with a metal pipe, rape and murder her, and set her body on fire.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important for me to concede at the start that I will ultimately fall short in this task,\u201d Marsh conceded to Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth at the hearing\u2019s opening last Tuesday. \u201cThere is not an explanation I can give you that is going to get us from that start to that finish.\u201d</p> <p>Herrmann, now 21, pleaded guilty to the rape and murder of Aiia Maasarwe, a 21-year-old Palestinian citizen of Israel, in the early hours of 16 January. Maasarwe was studying English at La Trobe university, and in the hours before her death was living her life: attending a comedy show with friends before travelling home by tram.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is not an explanation I can give you</p> <footer> <cite>Defence barrister Tim Marsh</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As far as we know, Maasarwe said only four words to Herrmann, in Arabic. \u201cYou piece of shit,\u201d she screamed, as he came up behind her just after she got off the tram at Bundoora, a suburb in Melbourne\u2019s north. It was a few minutes after midnight. Herrmann bashed her over the head four times with a metal pipe, before dragging her behind nearby hedges, striking her again perhaps nine times and raping her. She was unconscious for most of the attack, and probably dead when he set her body on fire. Herrmann has admitted that he intended to kill her.</p> <p>In a legal sense, the purpose of a plea hearing is for the prosecutor and the defence to argue factors relevant to the sentence that should be imposed, including mitigating factors that made the crime less serious than others, and aggravating factors that made it worse. There was no dispute that Herrmann\u2019s crime was exceptionally horrific and he will spend decades in prison.</p> <p>The three days of hearings were about whether someone who could commit such an unprovoked crime should spend the rest of his life in jail, with the possibility of parole at a distant time, or be handed a defined sentence, perhaps 30 years or so.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/02/aiia-maasarwe-attacked-by-killer-in-stereotypical-primitive-male-rage\">Aiia Maasarwe attacked by killer in 'stereotypical, primitive male rage'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hollingworth acknowledged that hers was an \u201cinvidious task\u201d to grade crimes as more or less serious, because it could seem insensitive to the family and the community, \u201cbut that is unfortunately what the law requires us to do\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Behind the legal arguments was the deeper story, the one that defied explanation. Herrmann, a slight man wearing a tracksuit top, sat at the back of the court. Through days of intense argument about who he was, what Marsh called his \u201cextraordinary dislocation and disadvantage\u201d, his humiliations, his substance abuse, his mental state, it was sometimes hard to remember he was there. His eyes were mostly downcast or staring into the distance. Occasionally he stroked his chin, or bit his lip. He seemed to be in his own world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1556f0e64de0deb2f609b5cd4d5abecd1ad13e41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1556f0e64de0deb2f609b5cd4d5abecd1ad13e41/0_0_3053_1831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Codey Herrmann\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Codey Herrmann is brought to the supreme court.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ross/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maasarwe\u2019s family was not present in court \u2013 they live overseas \u2013 but their pain was there. Her death became a symbol of women\u2019s rage at being unable to go out at night without fear of male violence, but the picture that emerged of her was of an individual, a young, vibrant daughter, sister and friend who loved travel and study, spoke four languages, a woman who lost her life in a few minutes of inexplicable horror.</p> <p>The plain-speaking prosecutor, Patrick Bourke, paused for several seconds, his bottom lip quivering, as he read out the family\u2019s victim statements. Maasarwe\u2019s mother, Kittam, still watches videos and reads her daughter\u2019s text messages, just to see her and hear her voice. \u201c\u2018I am a mother whom her heart has been squeezed in pain, day after day.\u201d</p> <p>Her father, Saeed, and sister, Noor, planned to visit Aiia in Australia. \u201cA lot of time I find myself lost, lost in the crowds, or sometimes stuck, stuck in the past. Now I live with fear,\u201d Noor wrote.</p> <p>After Maasarwe hopped off the tram to walk the rest of the way home, she rang another sister, Ruba, in Israel. She often did that when she was alone at night, just to feel safer. The call was answered, and Aiia said to Ruba, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to pick up\u201d.</p> <p>Seconds later, Hermann hit her from behind with the metal pipe, before dragging her away from sight into a garden bed behind low hedges. Ruba heard the phone drop and her sister screaming.</p> <p>The order of what happened next is not clear, but the prosecution says Herrmann strangled Maasarwe, bashed her a further nine times, and raped her. She died of extensive head injuries. In a futile attempt to cover up his crime, he poured the flammable solvent WD-40 over her, and set her alight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/19/its-just-horrific-feeling-of-deja-vu-as-melbourne-mourns-for-aiia-maasarwe\">\u2018It\u2019s just horrific\u2019: feeling of deja vu as Melbourne mourns for Aiia Maasarwe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For several hours before the attack, Herrmann had wandered around the nearby Polaris shopping centre, his image caught on CCTV. He spoke to a man and smoked a cigarette. He has given no explanation about what he was doing or thinking. He claims he doesn\u2019t know how he found the metal pipe or the WD-40 \u2013 they are not visible in CCTV footage. He has said he didn\u2019t plan the murder. Afterwards, he fled the scene, climbing over a fence into a nature reserve, leaving a trail of his DNA on his cap, the pipe, the can of fluid and on Maasarwe\u2019s body.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019ve seen fathers portrayed in movies\u2019</h2> <p>There\u2019s the crime itself and then there\u2019s what led up to it. The forensic psychiatrist Dr Andrew Carroll interviewed Herrmann in custody and had access to more than 2,000 pages of material from the Victorian Aboriginal Childcare Association, which has had contact with Herrmann since he was a baby. His mother was an Indigenous woman; his father was of German ancestry.</p> <p>There were multiple reports to authorities when Herrmann was a small child, Marsh said, \u201cdue to chronic drug and alcohol problems with his parents, domestic violence, emotional abuse and what was described perhaps euphemistically as, \u2018failure to meet his basic needs\u2019. This level of neglect was so profound that he and his older sister were reported to have rotten teeth.\u201d</p> <p>At less than 18 months old, Herrmann was placed in care and admitted to hospital with scabies. At age three, he and his sister were placed in foster care.</p> <p>Carroll explained the profound psychological impact of his early neglect and how it stunted his brain development. He traced his later distress at his mother failing to turn up to access visits, or arriving drunk. He had no contact with his father while he was in foster care. \u201cHe was reared in a chaotic, insecure, dangerous environment that was not responsive to his basic needs.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is the manifestation of male rage towards a female</p> <footer> <cite>Psychiatrist Andrew Carroll</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Herrmann has had no positive relationship with men, including his father. At one point, Carroll asked Herrmann about fathers and he said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen them portrayed in the movies, but I don\u2019t really know what they do.\u201d His mother died when he was a teenager.</p> <p>Even though his foster care was more stable, the early-childhood needs are critical for a child to develop any normal sense of attachment and trust in the world. By the time Herrmann entered primary school he was emotionally fragile, had difficulty forming relationships and harmed other children.</p> <p>Carroll\u2019s evidence was that Herrmann had a severe personality disorder with particular characteristics. His childhood neglect meant he avoided and suppressed his emotional distress. His unresolved trauma led to a \u201cdeep well-spring of sadness and anger\u201d that he had no skills to process. He had distorted assumptions about other people, with \u201cpersistent expectations of being exploited, humiliated and belittled\u201d \u2013 in middle childhood he had nightmares and slept in a foetal position. Normal functioning was seriously impaired and there was \u201ca sense almost of dissociation, a sense that he just doesn\u2019t matter in the world, that he\u2019s not real in some way\u201d.</p> <p>There was a \u201cmatrix of factors\u201d which led to this crime and Herrmann\u2019s personality disorder \u2013 a person\u2019s deficits in thinking, feeling and behaviour, particularly in relation to impulse control and interpersonal behaviour \u2013 was exacerbated by heavy cannabis and methamphetamine use that began when he was a teenager. That had a cumulative impact, but he had not taken drugs on the day of the murder.</p> <p>As a young adult, Herrmann was homeless and unemployed. According to Marsh, Herrmann\u2019s life \u201cfollowed a rhythm that was essentially, get Centrelink, buy drugs, share them with mates, shoplift food from the supermarket. He subsisted on a diet of croissants and chocolate milk \u2026 his lifestyle was one of the pursuit of intoxication through methamphetamine and cannabis.\u201d</p> <p>Carroll\u2019s evidence was that Herrmann\u2019s personality disorder seriously affected his ability to make judgments and was, with other factors, the underlying reason for the murder. It was an \u201ceruption of suppressed rage\u201d that had built for years. It erupted for some unknown reason on that night, against an innocent woman, with no known trigger. \u201cThis is the manifestation of male rage towards a female.\u201d</p> <p>The reason so long was spent on describing\u2019s Herrmann\u2019s personality disorder is that he has for many years been diagnosed as suffering schizophrenia, and is receiving anti-psychotic meditation.</p> <p>Carroll disagreed with that diagnosis, but legally a personality disorder is not considered a mental impairment that can be taken into consideration when sentencing in <a href=\"http://www.judicialcollege.vic.edu.au/eManuals/VSM/index.htm#6136.htm\">Victoria, under principles known as Verdins</a>.</p> <p>Marsh, chief counsel at Victoria Legal Aid, argued that a 2015 case \u2013 a court of appeal decision known as O\u2019Neill \u2013 was wrong to find that such disorders do not influence a sufferer\u2019s perception of the world, and urged Hollingworth to find so. There was no reason why personality disorders \u2013 which could seriously affect judgment \u2013 should be treated differently to mental illnesses that influence the moral culpability of an offender, such as severe depression or bipolar disorder.</p> <p>Bourke argued that the very randomness, the brutality, the lack of any motive made this the worst kind of murder justifying a life sentence. The O\u2019Neill decision was correct and Hollingworth sitting as a single judge was bound to follow it. There was \u201cno evidence of the present personality disorder having a causative connection, contribution to the commission of this offence against this girl on this night\u201d.</p> <p>If a trial is in some way an expression of community feeling and shifting attitudes, perhaps we are at a point where such crimes will be punished by 50 or 60 years in jail, even if they did not attract such severe sentences in the past.</p> <h2>Better off in jail than outside</h2> <p>It was the same issue that confronted the court just a few weeks ago when Jaymes Todd, another young man with no prior convictions, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/02/eurydice-dixon-killer-jaymes-todd-sentenced-to-life-imprisonment-for-and\">sentenced to life with a 35-year non-parole period for raping and murdering Eurydice Dixon</a>, 22, as she walked through a suburban Melbourne park.</p> <p>That was a controversial sentence in legal circles. Victoria Legal Aid funded Todd\u2019s plea hearing, but is not funding his appeal against the sentence \u2013 that will be conducted by private barristers pro bono.</p> <p>In Todd\u2019s case crown prosecutors did not seek a life sentence, but they did in Herrmann\u2019s case. Hollingworth wondered why, when Todd\u2019s was \u201cobjectively far more serious offending\u201d given his sexual sadism and stalking of Dixon.</p> <p>Herrmann is Aboriginal which, as Marsh pointed out, does not make him intrinsically less responsible for his crime and deserving of a more lenient sentence. But it often indicates deprivation and disadvantage, and his background of profound trauma, the instability of his identity and sense of futility could be seen as a mitigating factor in sentencing.</p> <p> Marsh said Herrmann\u2019s youth indicated rehabilitation was at least possible if the right treatment was offered. His sense of remorse was there, but it was muted. At the very end of the hearing, Herrmann handed Marsh a letter of apology he had written to Maasarwe\u2019s family. \u201cYour daughter didn\u2019t deserve such a terrible and tragic thing to happen to her,\u201d it said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect any forgiveness because I will never be able to forgive myself and I will be trying to make amends for the rest of my life.\u201d It ended: \u201cDon\u2019t give in to hate like I did. Love. Goodbye.\u201d</p> <p>Marsh said towards the end of the hearing that while it didn\u2019t diminish the loss of the Maasarwe family in any way, there was a second tragedy in the case we should not flinch from: how and why a young man could come to commit such an awful crime.</p> <p>Herrmann believed he was better off in jail than outside.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve gained a safe place to sleep,\u201d Marsh said Herrmann told him. \u201cI get fed three times a day, I have a shower, and I\u2019ve also gained a sense of hope that maybe one day if I behave myself in custody I might get to go to a prison that has good programs.\u201d</p> <p>That such a statement had a whiff of truth to it, said Marsh, was \u201ccoming from a place that is so bleak as to defy description\u201d.</p> <p>Codey Herrmann will be sentenced on 29 October.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Defence barrister Tim Marsh has a philosophical bent. A plea hearing is not a search for truth, he told the Victorian supreme court, but it is a search for an explanation. It was his task to explain why Codey Herrmann, aged 20, with no prior convictions and no history of violence, would viciously bash a young woman with a metal pipe, rape and murder her, and set her body on fire. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for me to concede at the start that I will ultimately fall short in this task,\u201d Marsh conceded to Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth at the hearing\u2019s opening last Tuesday. \u201cThere is not an explanation I can give you that is going to get us from that start to that finish.\u201d Herrmann, now 21, pleaded guilty to the rape and murder of Aiia Maasarwe, a 21-year-old Palestinian citizen of Israel, in the early hours of 16 January. Maasarwe was studying English at La Trobe university, and in the hours before her death was living her life: attending a comedy show with friends before travelling home by tram. As far as we know, Maasarwe said only four words to Herrmann, in Arabic. \u201cYou piece of shit,\u201d she screamed, as he came up behind her just after she got off the tram at Bundoora, a suburb in Melbourne\u2019s north. It was a few minutes after midnight. Herrmann bashed her over the head four times with a metal pipe, before dragging her behind nearby hedges, striking her again perhaps nine times and raping her. She was unconscious for most of the attack, and probably dead when he set her body on fire. Herrmann has admitted that he intended to kill her. In a legal sense, the purpose of a plea hearing is for the prosecutor and the defence to argue factors relevant to the sentence that should be imposed, including mitigating factors that made the crime less serious than others, and aggravating factors that made it worse. There was no dispute that Herrmann\u2019s crime was exceptionally horrific and he will spend decades in prison. The three days of hearings were about whether someone who could commit such an unprovoked crime should spend the rest of his life in jail, with the possibility of parole at a distant time, or be handed a defined sentence, perhaps 30 years or so. Hollingworth acknowledged that hers was an \u201cinvidious task\u201d to grade crimes as more or less serious, because it could seem insensitive to the family and the community, \u201cbut that is unfortunately what the law requires us to do\u201d, she said. Behind the legal arguments was the deeper story, the one that defied explanation. Herrmann, a slight man wearing a tracksuit top, sat at the back of the court. Through days of intense argument about who he was, what Marsh called his \u201cextraordinary dislocation and disadvantage\u201d, his humiliations, his substance abuse, his mental state, it was sometimes hard to remember he was there. His eyes were mostly downcast or staring into the distance. Occasionally he stroked his chin, or bit his lip. He seemed to be in his own world. Maasarwe\u2019s family was not present in court \u2013 they live overseas \u2013 but their pain was there. Her death became a symbol of women\u2019s rage at being unable to go out at night without fear of male violence, but the picture that emerged of her was of an individual, a young, vibrant daughter, sister and friend who loved travel and study, spoke four languages, a woman who lost her life in a few minutes of inexplicable horror. The plain-speaking prosecutor, Patrick Bourke, paused for several seconds, his bottom lip quivering, as he read out the family\u2019s victim statements. Maasarwe\u2019s mother, Kittam, still watches videos and reads her daughter\u2019s text messages, just to see her and hear her voice. \u201c\u2018I am a mother whom her heart has been squeezed in pain, day after day.\u201d Her father, Saeed, and sister, Noor, planned to visit Aiia in Australia. \u201cA lot of time I find myself lost, lost in the crowds, or sometimes stuck, stuck in the past. Now I live with fear,\u201d Noor wrote. After Maasarwe hopped off the tram to walk the rest of the way home, she rang another sister, Ruba, in Israel. She often did that when she was alone at night, just to feel safer. The call was answered, and Aiia said to Ruba, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to pick up\u201d. Seconds later, Hermann hit her from behind with the metal pipe, before dragging her away from sight into a garden bed behind low hedges. Ruba heard the phone drop and her sister screaming. The order of what happened next is not clear, but the prosecution says Herrmann strangled Maasarwe, bashed her a further nine times, and raped her. She died of extensive head injuries. In a futile attempt to cover up his crime, he poured the flammable solvent WD-40 over her, and set her alight. For several hours before the attack, Herrmann had wandered around the nearby Polaris shopping centre, his image caught on CCTV. He spoke to a man and smoked a cigarette. He has given no explanation about what he was doing or thinking. He claims he doesn\u2019t know how he found the metal pipe or the WD-40 \u2013 they are not visible in CCTV footage. He has said he didn\u2019t plan the murder. Afterwards, he fled the scene, climbing over a fence into a nature reserve, leaving a trail of his DNA on his cap, the pipe, the can of fluid and on Maasarwe\u2019s body. \u2018I\u2019ve seen fathers portrayed in movies\u2019 There\u2019s the crime itself and then there\u2019s what led up to it. The forensic psychiatrist Dr Andrew Carroll interviewed Herrmann in custody and had access to more than 2,000 pages of material from the Victorian Aboriginal Childcare Association, which has had contact with Herrmann since he was a baby. His mother was an Indigenous woman; his father was of German ancestry. There were multiple reports to authorities when Herrmann was a small child, Marsh said, \u201cdue to chronic drug and alcohol problems with his parents, domestic violence, emotional abuse and what was described perhaps euphemistically as, \u2018failure to meet his basic needs\u2019. This level of neglect was so profound that he and his older sister were reported to have rotten teeth.\u201d At less than 18 months old, Herrmann was placed in care and admitted to hospital with scabies. At age three, he and his sister were placed in foster care. Carroll explained the profound psychological impact of his early neglect and how it stunted his brain development. He traced his later distress at his mother failing to turn up to access visits, or arriving drunk. He had no contact with his father while he was in foster care. \u201cHe was reared in a chaotic, insecure, dangerous environment that was not responsive to his basic needs.\u201d Herrmann has had no positive relationship with men, including his father. At one point, Carroll asked Herrmann about fathers and he said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen them portrayed in the movies, but I don\u2019t really know what they do.\u201d His mother died when he was a teenager. Even though his foster care was more stable, the early-childhood needs are critical for a child to develop any normal sense of attachment and trust in the world. By the time Herrmann entered primary school he was emotionally fragile, had difficulty forming relationships and harmed other children. Carroll\u2019s evidence was that Herrmann had a severe personality disorder with particular characteristics. His childhood neglect meant he avoided and suppressed his emotional distress. His unresolved trauma led to a \u201cdeep well-spring of sadness and anger\u201d that he had no skills to process. He had distorted assumptions about other people, with \u201cpersistent expectations of being exploited, humiliated and belittled\u201d \u2013 in middle childhood he had nightmares and slept in a foetal position. Normal functioning was seriously impaired and there was \u201ca sense almost of dissociation, a sense that he just doesn\u2019t matter in the world, that he\u2019s not real in some way\u201d. There was a \u201cmatrix of factors\u201d which led to this crime and Herrmann\u2019s personality disorder \u2013 a person\u2019s deficits in thinking, feeling and behaviour, particularly in relation to impulse control and interpersonal behaviour \u2013 was exacerbated by heavy cannabis and methamphetamine use that began when he was a teenager. That had a cumulative impact, but he had not taken drugs on the day of the murder. As a young adult, Herrmann was homeless and unemployed. According to Marsh, Herrmann\u2019s life \u201cfollowed a rhythm that was essentially, get Centrelink, buy drugs, share them with mates, shoplift food from the supermarket. He subsisted on a diet of croissants and chocolate milk \u2026 his lifestyle was one of the pursuit of intoxication through methamphetamine and cannabis.\u201d Carroll\u2019s evidence was that Herrmann\u2019s personality disorder seriously affected his ability to make judgments and was, with other factors, the underlying reason for the murder. It was an \u201ceruption of suppressed rage\u201d that had built for years. It erupted for some unknown reason on that night, against an innocent woman, with no known trigger. \u201cThis is the manifestation of male rage towards a female.\u201d The reason so long was spent on describing\u2019s Herrmann\u2019s personality disorder is that he has for many years been diagnosed as suffering schizophrenia, and is receiving anti-psychotic meditation. Carroll disagreed with that diagnosis, but legally a personality disorder is not considered a mental impairment that can be taken into consideration when sentencing in Victoria, under principles known as Verdins. Marsh, chief counsel at Victoria Legal Aid, argued that a 2015 case \u2013 a court of appeal decision known as O\u2019Neill \u2013 was wrong to find that such disorders do not influence a sufferer\u2019s perception of the world, and urged Hollingworth to find so. There was no reason why personality disorders \u2013 which could seriously affect judgment \u2013 should be treated differently to mental illnesses that influence the moral culpability of an offender, such as severe depression or bipolar disorder. Bourke argued that the very randomness, the brutality, the lack of any motive made this the worst kind of murder justifying a life sentence. The O\u2019Neill decision was correct and Hollingworth sitting as a single judge was bound to follow it. There was \u201cno evidence of the present personality disorder having a causative connection, contribution to the commission of this offence against this girl on this night\u201d. If a trial is in some way an expression of community feeling and shifting attitudes, perhaps we are at a point where such crimes will be punished by 50 or 60 years in jail, even if they did not attract such severe sentences in the past. Better off in jail than outside It was the same issue that confronted the court just a few weeks ago when Jaymes Todd, another young man with no prior convictions, was sentenced to life with a 35-year non-parole period for raping and murdering Eurydice Dixon, 22, as she walked through a suburban Melbourne park. That was a controversial sentence in legal circles. Victoria Legal Aid funded Todd\u2019s plea hearing, but is not funding his appeal against the sentence \u2013 that will be conducted by private barristers pro bono. In Todd\u2019s case crown prosecutors did not seek a life sentence, but they did in Herrmann\u2019s case. Hollingworth wondered why, when Todd\u2019s was \u201cobjectively far more serious offending\u201d given his sexual sadism and stalking of Dixon. Herrmann is Aboriginal which, as Marsh pointed out, does not make him intrinsically less responsible for his crime and deserving of a more lenient sentence. But it often indicates deprivation and disadvantage, and his background of profound trauma, the instability of his identity and sense of futility could be seen as a mitigating factor in sentencing. Marsh said Herrmann\u2019s youth indicated rehabilitation was at least possible if the right treatment was offered. His sense of remorse was there, but it was muted. At the very end of the hearing, Herrmann handed Marsh a letter of apology he had written to Maasarwe\u2019s family. \u201cYour daughter didn\u2019t deserve such a terrible and tragic thing to happen to her,\u201d it said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect any forgiveness because I will never be able to forgive myself and I will be trying to make amends for the rest of my life.\u201d It ended: \u201cDon\u2019t give in to hate like I did. Love. Goodbye.\u201d Marsh said towards the end of the hearing that while it didn\u2019t diminish the loss of the Maasarwe family in any way, there was a second tragedy in the case we should not flinch from: how and why a young man could come to commit such an awful crime. Herrmann believed he was better off in jail than outside. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a safe place to sleep,\u201d Marsh said Herrmann told him. \u201cI get fed three times a day, I have a shower, and I\u2019ve also gained a sense of hope that maybe one day if I behave myself in custody I might get to go to a prison that has good programs.\u201d That such a statement had a whiff of truth to it, said Marsh, was \u201ccoming from a place that is so bleak as to defy description\u201d. Codey Herrmann will be sentenced on 29 October.",
