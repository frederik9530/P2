Fiona Boulton, the chair of the Headmasters\u2019 and Headmistresses\u2019 Conference (HMC), said that Labour\u2019s pledge last week to endorse a series of measures that will effectively abolish private schools was based on \u201cignorance and the desire to damage\u201d. Boulton was due to address about 300 heads from many of the country\u2019s most expensive independent schools at the HMC autumn conference in London on Monday as the battle over the future of Britain\u2019s private schools gathers momentum. Last week, the Labour party voted in favour of new policies that would strip private schools of charitable status, add VAT to fees, restrict their pupils\u2019 access to higher education and redistribute their endowments, investments and properties to the state sector. In her speech, Boulton claimed Labour\u2019s manifesto commitment was a vote loser and called on members to \u201cfight alongside each other in pursuit of a privileged childhood for all\u201d, adding: \u201cWe stand proud of our contribution to education in this country. \u201cThis is a time for inclusion, acceptance and friendship and a time to inspire harmony.

      "bodyText": "Truck drivers should be routinely tested for sleep apnoea after a study found that half of them suffer from breathing disorders. In a survey of 905 Italian truck drivers, it was found that approximately half suffered from at least one sleep-related breathing problem that could potentially cause them to fall asleep at the wheel. In a presentation at the European Respiratory Society international congress today (Monday), Luca Roberti, president of Apnoici Italiani, the Italian sleep apnoea patient association, called for compulsory testing of sleep-related breathing problems by European haulage companies. \u201cConsidering that drivers are in charge of transport vehicles weighing several tons, companies have a great moral and civic responsibility to ensure their employees are safe to drive and are not at risk of suddenly falling asleep at the wheel,\u201d he said. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing. Research has shown that someone who is deprived of sleep due to OSA may be up to 12 times more likely to be involved in a driving accident. The European Union Directive, created to limit accidents arising from OSA, requires drivers with moderate or severe OSA to seek medical advice before their licences can be issued or renewed. The study was carried out in 2018 at the request of the Italian truck driver cooperative, Federtrasporti. On 44 days between March and December, doctors and nurses spoke to drivers at truck dealerships owned by 50 different companies. They measured height, weight and waist circumference, medical conditions, such as diabetes, and also took into account lifestyles and whether the participants smoked or took drugs. Other factors that were considered included length of service, distances travelled and whether they drove national or international routes. Of the 905 drivers interviewed, 887 were men and 17 women with an average age of 46 years. Researchers found that 77% were overweight or obese. Nearly 10% of drivers said their partners noticed that they sometimes stopped breathing when they were sleeping; 55% were habitual snorers and 43% were at risk of OSA. Roberti said: \u201cThis observational study has underlined the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea among truck drivers, which is greater than the prevalence in the general population. This is due to a lifestyle that forces the drivers to sit for several hours a day, with little physical activity and a poor diet, leading to a greater risk of excessive daytime sleepiness and of dozing off unexpectedly while driving.\u201d The prevalence of OSA in the general population is estimated to range between 6% to 17%, with certain groups, such as those who are overweight, the elderly and some ethnic minorities, having a higher risk. \u201cHaulage companies should make it compulsory for their drivers to have examinations to diagnose any sleep-related breathing problems, and both they and their drivers should give careful consideration to drivers\u2019 diets,\u201d concluded Roberti.",

      "bodyText": "A series of announcements of major new infrastructure projects in hospitals and transport to mark the start of the Conservative conference has prompted criticism after it emerged much of the spending was either not new or notably less ambitious than billed. Labour was particularly scathing about a package of transport measures headlined with \u00a325bn in already-declared funds for road improvements, calling it a \u201ccombination of re-announcements and damp squibs\u201d. The main pre-conference spending pledge, presented as \u00a313bn to build 40 new hospitals, fell apart after it emerged that the actual money committed so far, \u00a33bn, would go to just six NHS trusts, which had plans already in place for hospitals in need of rebuilding. Another 21 trusts would receive much smaller sums, but only to assist preparatory work for plans to take place almost a decade from now. Speaking at a fringe event at the Conservative conference in Manchester, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, stuck to the official line, saying the government was committed to \u201c40 new hospital projects\u201d. Hancock said the plans would survive future spending decision rounds: \u201cWe\u2019ll have that debate in the spending review. But the thing is I\u2019ve got absolute rock-solid support from the prime minister for what I\u2019ve needed to do.\u201d He also said the \u00a33bn extra would be in addition to an already announced \u00a31.8bn tranche of funding for NHS building repairs. Hancock also claimed that Labour would not support the extra spending, something rejected by Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, who said he was simply querying the opaqueness of the plans. The news about the hospitals was heavily trailed in newspapers on Sunday as part of a government PR push on the NHS, with Boris Johnson calling it \u201cthe biggest hospital building programme in a generation\u201d. However, Ashworth said, this had \u201cquickly unravelled as spin\u201d. \u201cThis isn\u2019t 40 new hospitals, it is just reconfiguring six,\u201d he said. \u201cNew investment is desperately needed and of course we welcome any genuine new money, but patients and demoralised NHS staff are fed up of being taken for fools like this.\u201d The subsequent announcement of spending on roads, buses and internet connectivity, was unveiled by the chancellor, Sajid Javid, as \u201cthe first step in our plans to deliver an infrastructure revolution\u201d. \u201cInvestment in our infrastructure will be key to making the next decade one of renewal \u2013 boosting our economy and making life easier for people all across the country,\u201d Javid said. However, the Treasury said that the only new element in the main part of the announcement, \u00a325bn to upgrade roads over five years, was confirmation of which specific projects had been chosen as the first to go ahead. The actual sum was announced last year in the form of the government\u2019s second so-called road investment strategy, with many of the 14 specific road projects, such as making all the A66 trans-Pennine road dual carriageway, also unveiled at the time. Another major element, \u00a3220m for what is billed as a national bus strategy to improve services across England, including money on electric buses, was announced at the last government spending round, with the only news being how it will be spent. The Treasury said, however, that all but \u00a3200m of an announced \u00a35bn to improve full-fibre and 5G internet networks was new. However, Labour said that according to the National Infrastructure Commission, building and maintaining a national full-fibre network would cost more than \u00a333bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThis combination of re-announcements and damp squibs shows up the real difference between the parties: the Tories tinkering around the edges, versus Labour\u2019s fundamental shift of power and wealth from the few \u2013 to the many. \u201cA hundred and thirteen times more for roads than for public transport makes a mockery of the Tories\u2019 so-called green credentials. \u201cAnd yet another headline pledge, this time on broadband, turns out to be false: Boris Johnson called for full-fibre for all premises by 2025, but the chancellor now says he\u2019ll invest \u00a35bn in lower grade \u2018gigabit-capable\u2019 technology, less than a sixth of what it will take to deliver full fibre to all.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Sofia Levin has first-hand experience of the connection between people and pets. In 2015, Levin, a food journalist and copywriter, brought home a toy red poodle called Jinkee. Charmed by the new addition to her family, she shared photos of her puppy on an Instagram account called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lifeofjinkee/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">@lifeofjinkee</a>. Five years later, Jinkee has a follower base of 77,000 and counting.</p> <p>\u201cI sent an especially cute photo of her to an account called Dogs of Instagram and @lifeofjinkee went from a few hundred to a few thousand followers overnight,\u201d Levin laughs. \u201cI think [the account\u2019s success] is a combination of Jinkee, my experience using social media and timing - now it\u2019s more difficult to grow organically on Instagram.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband and I sometimes joke that Jinkee may pay her own way through college. It wasn\u2019t something I went into for the income, but as a freelancer, it is helpful.\u201d</p> <p>Jinkee has since partnered with brands including Petbarn and Woolworths. Levin has also used Jinkee\u2019s platform to launch <a href=\"https://www.pinstapals.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pinstapals</a>, a line of dog-shaped enamel pins, with $2 from each sale donated to Lort Smith, a not-for-profit animal hospital. The rise of influencers such as Jinkee reflects Australia\u2019s growing connection with animals - and a new wave of entrepreneurial ambitions that revolve around humans and the creatures they love.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d562d39594b79cc4c32b53247762cf752b0e8ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d562d39594b79cc4c32b53247762cf752b0e8ec/78_75_1778_2242/793.jpg\" alt=\"My husband and I sometimes joke that Jinkee may pay her own way through college.\" width=\"793\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">My husband and I sometimes joke that Jinkee may pay her own way through college.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Life of Jinkee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Australia has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of pet ownership, with more than 60% of households owning a domestic animal, according to a 2018 report from <a href=\"https://www.ibisworld.com.au/industry-trends/specialised-market-research-reports/consumer-goods-services/pets-pet-supplies-retailers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ibisworld</a>. And Australians increasingly consider pets part of the family, an attachment that reduces stress levels, according to a 2019 report in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/when-pets-are-family-the-benefits-extend-into-society-109179\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Conversation</a>.</p> <p>Australians are spending more money to ensure their pets are healthy, safe and happy. Pets definitely have the potential to be good business, based on 2018 statistics from the <a href=\"https://www.commbank.com.au/guidance/newsroom/Aussies-pampering-their-pets-201807.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Commonwealth Bank</a> showing that spending on pets had jumped more than 90% in two years.</p> <p>Thea Mendes understands the business opportunities that the bonds between pets and owners can create. Mendes started DOMUTS, a line of doughnuts for dogs, in 2017 after her 11-year-old son, Marcus, came up with the idea.

      "bodyText": "Sofia Levin has first-hand experience of the connection between people and pets. In 2015, Levin, a food journalist and copywriter, brought home a toy red poodle called Jinkee. Charmed by the new addition to her family, she shared photos of her puppy on an Instagram account called @lifeofjinkee. Five years later, Jinkee has a follower base of 77,000 and counting. \u201cI sent an especially cute photo of her to an account called Dogs of Instagram and @lifeofjinkee went from a few hundred to a few thousand followers overnight,\u201d Levin laughs. \u201cI think [the account\u2019s success] is a combination of Jinkee, my experience using social media and timing - now it\u2019s more difficult to grow organically on Instagram. \u201cMy husband and I sometimes joke that Jinkee may pay her own way through college. It wasn\u2019t something I went into for the income, but as a freelancer, it is helpful.\u201d Jinkee has since partnered with brands including Petbarn and Woolworths. Levin has also used Jinkee\u2019s platform to launch Pinstapals, a line of dog-shaped enamel pins, with $2 from each sale donated to Lort Smith, a not-for-profit animal hospital. The rise of influencers such as Jinkee reflects Australia\u2019s growing connection with animals - and a new wave of entrepreneurial ambitions that revolve around humans and the creatures they love. Australia has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of pet ownership, with more than 60% of households owning a domestic animal, according to a 2018 report from Ibisworld. And Australians increasingly consider pets part of the family, an attachment that reduces stress levels, according to a 2019 report in The Conversation. Australians are spending more money to ensure their pets are healthy, safe and happy. Pets definitely have the potential to be good business, based on 2018 statistics from the Commonwealth Bank showing that spending on pets had jumped more than 90% in two years. Thea Mendes understands the business opportunities that the bonds between pets and owners can create. Mendes started DOMUTS, a line of doughnuts for dogs, in 2017 after her 11-year-old son, Marcus, came up with the idea. Keeping up with customer demand was her biggest hurdle. \u201cI was trying to do everything on my own and I got burnt out,\u201d says Mendes, who recommends that entrepreneurs starting a pet business ask for help if they need it. \u201cI was trying to bake and decorate the doughnuts, deliver and drop samples off to potential wholesalers and do that in my spare time because I was working full-time.\u201d When CGU Insurance realised that almost half a million ABNs were cancelled in 2018-19, it launched its ABN Rescue campaign, in a bid to get small businesses back on track. Mendes saw the call-out, and asked for help. CGU saw DOMUTS\u2019 potential. Mendes\u2019s application was successful, and with the help of a business adviser, food technologist and marketing expertise, she is now equipped with a business and marketing plan, a commercial kitchen, and a clear way forward. She suggests anyone with a bright business idea for pets should try experimenting on a small scale first. \u201cIf it\u2019s a new product, give it a go at your local market because you\u2019re still testing the waters,\u201d she says. \u201cYou get instant feedback from your customers if your product is priced right and tastes good.\u201d For Mendes, this was a favourite part of the process. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to open up a pet business make it something you enjoy,\u201d she says. \u201c[For me] it\u2019s about it\u2019s about the satisfaction and joy on the owner\u2019s face.

Marks is the founder of the High End group, an invitation-only Facebook community that\u2019s one of the social media platform\u2019s best-known marketplaces for vintage designer fashion. More than 80,000 members flock to High End to sell hard-to-find pieces from designers such as Hermes and Prada. But when Marks started High End around her day job, she learnt the ropes as she went along.</p> <p>\u201cI realised there was a gap in the market to sell high-end pieces,\u201d Marks says. \u201cAt first, I wanted to sell some of my wardrobe and then it turned into a passion project.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the fact that she was still working a day job, Marks initially spent five hours a day moderating the community and fielding customer service requests. \u201cCustomer service was always really important to me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Marks has since hired a customer service team. She\u2019s also joined forces with Reggie Obey, and together they have launched The Consign, a private luxury consignment service that serves women in Melbourne and Sydney, with a view to expanding in the coming months.</p> <p>\u201cHigh End has expanded our team and has targets to hit 240,000 members by 2022,\u201d Obey says. \u201cBecause we run High End on Facebook, we have limitations in terms of what we can automate, so time is our biggest obstacle. We\u2019ve had plenty of barriers, but we\u2019ve used them to grow.\u201d</p> <p>Commercial aspirations can be a powerful entrepreneurial motivation. But the biggest payoffs can involve new opportunities to solve creative problems and test bold ideas.

More than 80,000 members flock to High End to sell hard-to-find pieces from designers such as Hermes and Prada. But when Marks started High End around her day job, she learnt the ropes as she went along. \u201cI realised there was a gap in the market to sell high-end pieces,\u201d Marks says. \u201cAt first, I wanted to sell some of my wardrobe and then it turned into a passion project.\u201d Despite the fact that she was still working a day job, Marks initially spent five hours a day moderating the community and fielding customer service requests. \u201cCustomer service was always really important to me,\u201d she says. Marks has since hired a customer service team. She\u2019s also joined forces with Reggie Obey, and together they have launched The Consign, a private luxury consignment service that serves women in Melbourne and Sydney, with a view to expanding in the coming months. \u201cHigh End has expanded our team and has targets to hit 240,000 members by 2022,\u201d Obey says. \u201cBecause we run High End on Facebook, we have limitations in terms of what we can automate, so time is our biggest obstacle. We\u2019ve had plenty of barriers, but we\u2019ve used them to grow.\u201d Commercial aspirations can be a powerful entrepreneurial motivation. But the biggest payoffs can involve new opportunities to solve creative problems and test bold ideas. For Oli Sansom, a respected Melbourne documentary photographer, starting The Arbourists - a side business offering wildly imaginative, custom-made wedding arbours - offered the chance to reinvent an aspect of a well-worn industry. Fifty-three per cent of Australians dream of starting a business or side hustle but only 6% have actually done it. Sally Kiernan \u201cWe wanted to bring one small thing that\u2019s a little bit different to an industry that\u2019s based around this idea of ritual, because this space is changing dramatically as folks change what tradition means to them,\u201d says Sansom, who runs The Arbourists on weekends with business partner Matt Hedrich. \u201cI lean towards going vision first at all costs and then everything else works out.\u201d Every year, nearly half a million ABNs get cancelled. And with them, the ambition to start those businesses is lost. For Sally Kiernan, marketing director of CGU Insurance, ambition and bravery deserve to be encouraged. \u201cFifty-three per cent of Australians dream of starting a business or side hustle but only 6% have actually done it,\u201d Kiernan says. \u201cThea Mendes is part of that 6% and we wanted to back her ambition and get DOMUTS back on track.\u201d As part of its ABN Rescue campaign, CGU Insurance provided Mendes with a business mentor, a food technologist, an industrial kitchen, a website, and a new marketing plan, including a TV ad scheduled to run during the AFL grand final. \u201cMy business mentor, David Stefanoff, has helped me draft a clear business plan with timelines,\u201d Mendes says. \u201cThe food technologist has helped me reformulate the recipes to ensure the products are cost-effective but also have a longer life.\u201d Initially daunted by the financial risk of scaling her side hustle, Mendes now feels equipped to achieve her off-the-clock ambitions. \u201cMy mother always told me that if you want something and you work hard enough, it will happen,\u201d she says.

      "bodyText": "Chris Wilder entered the media suite profuse with apologies for his lateness. He had been waylaid by J\u00fcrgen Klopp, held up by his own tribute to the man named Fifa\u2019s coach of the year. The Sheffield United manager had given his Liverpool counterpart his second prize of the week, a bottle of champagne. \u201cI wanted to present him with something from our football club, because I think it is important we recognise his achievements,\u201d said Wilder. The third gift, sadly for him, came from his goalkeeper, Dean Henderson, who presented Liverpool with the points. Wilder could not vouch for the quality of bottle\u2019s contents; nor was it drunk by either manager. \u201cI am not a connoisseur of champagne,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has had a beer and talked about the game. He is open and that is quite refreshing because I don\u2019t get that feel that quite a few managers in the Premier League want to do that. He is a right down-to-earth guy.\u201d There is, one senses, no higher praise from the deliberately unflashy Wilder. These are two managers who have been tactical innovators but, as Wilder\u2019s overlapping centre-backs eschewed overlapping to subdue Liverpool\u2019s inverted wingers and false nine, earthy qualities helped secure Liverpool\u2019s 16th successive league win. This was not champagne football. \u201cWe had to adapt and battle,\u201d Virgil van Dijk said. \u201cThat was tough. The hostile atmosphere is something I enjoy. We fought hard for the three points.\u201d Liverpool won ugly. Arguably they had done at Chelsea six days earlier, too. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the first time,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times we did that already and that feels good.\u201d Victory was sealed by Henderson\u2019s error, allowing Georginio Wijnaldum\u2019s shot to wriggle out of his grasp, but also forged by sweat, by more graft than craft. Klopp\u2019s Liverpool are workaholics. He sees beauty in industry. \u201cThey didn\u2019t fight more or run more than us, which is important. It\u2019s not about waiting for the moment when it clicks and we fly and shoot somebody out of their own stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about really working for that moment and we had to work for 95 minutes.\u201d This was not Liverpool at their gun-slinging best. Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s aim was awry, Mohamed Salah short of bullets, Roberto Firmino starved of ammunition. \u201cLook at how they defended Bobby; that was really good,\u201d said an admiring Klopp. \u201cWe didn\u2019t find him as often as we wanted.\u201d Victory was instead underpinned by the men who preserved a clean sheet.

At Goodison Park he operated on a level that had him above even the oft-peerless Kevin De Bruyne.</p> <p>It was the winger\u2019s first-half burst along the right that initiated Gabriel Jesus\u2019s opener. Then, when Dominic Calvert-Lewin equalised, Mahrez\u2019s 25-yard free-kick following the break was a sweetly directed thing of beauty. He was also instrumental in Raheem Sterling\u2019s third, combining with Sergio Ag\u00fcero to create the opening.</p> <p>As Guardiola said: \u201cAll this season he is playing outstanding. The action on the first goal, the second one, the two assists he did, one especially to Raheem. His commitment defensively. One year he was the best player in the league so is an exceptional player. I\u2019m happy for him because he\u2019s playing at an incredible level.\u201d</p> <p>In the 3-0 Champions League win at Shakhtar Donetsk 10 days ago there was a moment at the start of the game when the ball was pinged to Mahrez at speed. He killed it dead, moved inside and the tone was set, the player going on to register the opener.</p> <p>Mahrez arrived in the summer of 2018 and Guardiola said before this season began that this could be his year. So far he has started five games, four of them in the league. \u201cI said many times in our press conference last season that I think he played good but played [only a] few [times],\u201d the manager said before pointing to Mahrez\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/19/senegal-algeria-africa-cup-of-nations-final-match-report\" title=\"\">captaining his country to glory in July</a>. \u201cI think the Africa Cup [of Nations] made him believe how good he can be. He knows it but I think it helps to win this kind of trophy for Algeria, for his country.</p> <p>\u201cIt was so important for him. From the beginning he arrived with an incredible mentality, positive and the way he plays. He has the feeling when he gets that ball in that position, the 18-yard box close to the area, something is going to happen. It\u2019s a feeling and I think all the spectators can have that feeling and that is because he has a gift.

      "bodyText": "Riyad Mahrez decorated Manchester City\u2019s victory against Everton on Saturday with a glittering display that left Pep Guardiola purring over his \u201cgift\u201d and illustrated why the Algerian has been Manchester City\u2019s standout performer of the campaign. Mahrez was back to the level that led to him being voted PFA Players Player of the Year in 2015-16, the season in which the 28-year-old proved pivotal in Leicester City\u2019s title triumph. At Goodison Park he operated on a level that had him above even the oft-peerless Kevin De Bruyne. It was the winger\u2019s first-half burst along the right that initiated Gabriel Jesus\u2019s opener. Then, when Dominic Calvert-Lewin equalised, Mahrez\u2019s 25-yard free-kick following the break was a sweetly directed thing of beauty. He was also instrumental in Raheem Sterling\u2019s third, combining with Sergio Ag\u00fcero to create the opening. As Guardiola said: \u201cAll this season he is playing outstanding. The action on the first goal, the second one, the two assists he did, one especially to Raheem. His commitment defensively. One year he was the best player in the league so is an exceptional player. I\u2019m happy for him because he\u2019s playing at an incredible level.\u201d In the 3-0 Champions League win at Shakhtar Donetsk 10 days ago there was a moment at the start of the game when the ball was pinged to Mahrez at speed. He killed it dead, moved inside and the tone was set, the player going on to register the opener. Mahrez arrived in the summer of 2018 and Guardiola said before this season began that this could be his year. So far he has started five games, four of them in the league. \u201cI said many times in our press conference last season that I think he played good but played [only a] few [times],\u201d the manager said before pointing to Mahrez\u2019s captaining his country to glory in July. \u201cI think the Africa Cup [of Nations] made him believe how good he can be. He knows it but I think it helps to win this kind of trophy for Algeria, for his country. \u201cIt was so important for him. From the beginning he arrived with an incredible mentality, positive and the way he plays. He has the feeling when he gets that ball in that position, the 18-yard box close to the area, something is going to happen. It\u2019s a feeling and I think all the spectators can have that feeling and that is because he has a gift. He has something special.\u201d Of the free-kick that beat Jordan Pickford to his right, Mahrez said: \u201cFirstly I wanted to put it the other side of the keeper. Then I noticed there was a big space, I tried to whip it in on the other side and it had a little bounce before he touched it, so it was difficult for him.\u201d City\u2019s victory ensured Liverpool\u2019s lead was kept at five points. \u201cIt\u2019s very important,\u201d Mahrez said. \u201cIt was 1-1 so to score at this moment of the game was crucial and with the third goal we killed the game.\u201d Mahrez\u2019s form is also a further challenge to Leroy San\u00e9. The German is injured but, came close to leaving in the summer and when he returns, a wish for more game-time may be stymied by the Algerian. Part of Guardiola\u2019s success is predicated on competition in all positions, as was shown at Everton by Jesus being preferred to Ag\u00fcero, the Brazilian subsequently scoring. \u201cI try to make all of them involved, it\u2019s simple like that,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cI know they maybe don\u2019t understand but I try. Some players don\u2019t play regularly, less minutes than the other ones, but the important players I try to let them play. \u201c[Ilkay] G\u00fcndogan is at an incredible level, Kevin [De Bruyne] is.

The Polish team put their two male athletes in the open legs and led by 50 metres after the second lap but their anchor leg athlete, Justyna Swiety-Ersetic, was eventually swallowed up by the US team, who won gold, the Jamaicans, who took silver, and Bahrainian team, who claimed bronze.</p> \n<p>However there was disappointment for Britain\u2019s team of Rabah Yousif, Zoey Clark, Emily Diamond and Martyn Rooney who finished fourth after a poor final baton change.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69369086-9ca7-4a81-b447-3700db619c0d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Denise Lewis, the former Olympic gold medallist and BBC commentator, has joined the chorus of those criticising the decision to stage the World Championships in Doha, calling the attendances \"shocking\" and accusing the IAAF of \u201cletting athletes down massively\u201d.</p>\n    <p>The event, which usually takes place in August, has been beset with tiny attendances and complaints of excessive heat and humidity by numerous athletes, including the world decathlon champion Kevin Mayer, who said it was a \u201cdisaster\u201d to come to Qatar.</p>\n    <p>Lewis has now waded into the row that has overshadowed these championships, saying the event was even worse than she expected. \u201cWe waited until October to have stands like this \u2013 empty. It\u2019s shocking,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right. Our governing body has let our athletes down, massively. I didn\u2019t expect it to be this bad.

It makes the British Champs look quite good! You do notice it.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Gemili shrugged when asked whether the IAAF had made the right decision. \u201cIt\u2019s not in our hands. We have no say. We get told to turn up and run and that\u2019s what we do. It makes no difference to us.&nbsp;Hopefully Goldie Sayers can get on the commission.

If she gets selected things will start&nbsp;happening.\u201d<br><br>There also looked to be no more than 1,000 spectators watching on Sunday night when Dina Asher-Smith won a silver medal, leading the BBC's Steve Cram to say: \"The sad thing for me is that it was in front of a pretty&nbsp;empty stadium.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Sean Ingle\u2019s report from Doha. In the mixed 4x400, the United States beat Jamaica and Bahrain to claim the gold medal. Allyson Felix claimed her 12th world gold medal to surpass Usain Bolt\u2019s haul. Martyn Rooney attempted to flash home for Team GB &amp; NI to win bronze, but they lost out. He has a conspiracy theory on the Bahrain team crossing the line when passing the baton so one to watch. Can this event survive? It was fun but is that enough? Asher-Smith speaks! \u201cI\u2019ve worked so hard for this and hopefully I\u2019ll go onto bigger things. I thought \u2018this is your time to go\u2019 and I came away with a PB and national record. I\u2019d have loved to win today but Shelly-Anne is an absolute legend and I\u2019m happy. For me it\u2019s always been to stay focused and keep my eye on the prize. I\u2019ve done 100m at a world champs before so it was a new experience for me at this level and I couldn\u2019t have done it without my coaching team.\u201d She has the 200m to start tomorrow so she\u2019ll be straight off to bed now hoping to go one better! Her time was 10.83. Fraser-Pryce won it in 10.71. That was sensational from Fraser-Pryce, who wins this for the fourth time. It was never in doubt from the start really but Asher-Smith did superbly to power through and finish very strongly to come second. And Dina Asher-Smith takes silver after a superb run! Ta Lou earns bronze. Daniels, Ta Lou, Thompson, Fraser-Price, Asher-Smith, Ahoure, Smith. Those are your contenders and they\u2019re set .. The atmosphere, such as it could ever be, has been whipped up for this. The lights are out, with a spotlight on each competitor as they are announced. Schippers has a groin problem, we\u2019re told, so she will concentrate on the 200m and skip this. And in video form. Sorry for so many of these but it\u2019s important. I know this is a running theme but it\u2019s a *vital* one. This should be a blue riband event. It\u2019s been ruined, sacrificed, and for what? You can draw your own conclusions, and athletics is obviously not the only sport to have gone this way. But it\u2019s appalling really. Now we await Dina Asher-Smith in the women\u2019s 100m final \u2013 it\u2019s under 10 minutes away ... Yes, he takes it from Claye and Hugues Fabrice Zango, from Burkina Faso, who does superbly to finish with the bronze right at the end. It was never in a lot of doubt and he\u2019s now won four of these. Christian Taylor leads the way in the triple jump but just 23cm separate the top three, with Will Claye and Pedro Pablo Pichardo pushing hard; it\u2019s going to be very tight here. It\u2019s just inexcusable. She had one to win it at 4.95 and the neutral athlete does it in style! Morris is second but what a performance that is! So the remarkable Felix gets her gold. Great Britain were never quite in contention there, the final Bahraini athlete, Abbas, doing a very good job of holding Rooney off in the last 200m. Jamaica second, Bahrain third and GB, led home by Martyn Rooney, have to settle for fourth. The winning time is 3:09.34. Poland finish fifth, Belgium sixth, India seventh. Felix and company are lining up for the mixed 4x400m final. We have Belgium, Great Britain, Jamaica, US, Brazil, Poland, India and Bahrain in the mix. Stefanidi is confirmed as bronze medalist in the pole vault. We will have a new world champion \u2013 Morris or Sidorova ... The men\u2019s triple jump final is underway too, now. We will keep you posted ... Kyle Langford speaks: \u201cI was quicker than anyone in the front straight and people are cutting in each other, the Kenyan cut me up three times and the Moroccan as well. They ruin the racing, you want to keep it clean, it\u2019s so shovey. I should have kept myself out of that danger perhaps. We\u2019ll see what happens, emotions are high right now.\u201d It was definitely a bit physical in there and at one point he almost fell. He wonders if this gives him a claim to a place in the final, but doesn\u2019t sound overly optimistic. Back in the pole vault, Morris *nearly* gets over 4.95 at the first attempt but looks happy enough. She\u2019ll have two more attempts. Sidorova can\u2019t make it either so it\u2019s getting tense ... The third semi of the men\u2019s 800m sees Kyle Langford in the mix, but he can do no better than a slightly scrappy fifth. Tuka is first, Hoppel second, and only those two go through. Allyson Felix is in the US team for the mixed 4x400m relay. She is going to win gold \u2013 her 12th world title and her first since having a baby. Morris now goes clear at 4.90 and is *ecstatic* with that \u2013 she\u2019s right in the driving seat now! Here is Bradshaw \u2013 she\u2019s going for a lifetime best at 4.90 and here is her moment of truth ... but she can\u2019t quite make it and that\u2019s going to be fourth place for her. She\u2019s been really brave tonight and can count herself unlucky. Jamie Webb now takes part in an 800m semi. He\u2019ll probably need a PB, if he doesn\u2019t make it into the top two, but might he have a chance? In the event he is well beaten; it\u2019s a front two of Brazier and Arop, with Webb ending right at the back. Now Stefanidi makes it over and Bradshaw will have to get her third one right in a few minutes ... but no, she\u2019s passed, she\u2019s going to have a crack at 4.90 instead. And she\u2019ll stay there, at best, after not quite clearing it again. But there\u2019ll be one more try ... Sandi Morris, visibly and audibly delighted, is the first to clear 4.85m. Newman can\u2019t get near it and nor, really, can Bengtsson on the pole she borrowed after hers broke. Then Sidorova joins Morris out at the front; Bradshaw remains in third. Now heat one of the men\u2019s 800m semis. Elliot Giles of Great Britain is among the contenders. He starts well and hangs firmly on the tail of the leaders but can\u2019t force his way through a crowd of runners on the last corner and finishes fifth. The guaranteed qualifiers are (1) Vazquez and (2) Rotich. Defending champion Stefanidi doesn\u2019t make it over either so there really is all to play for at the moment. Now here\u2019s Bradshaw aiming for 4.85, which would be a new lifetime outdoor best ... but she never really catches it and can\u2019t get over first time. Nasty moment for Bengtsson there, whose pole snaps as she tries the vault. She flies into the padding and is lucky to avoid injury. But she gets up, tries again ... and clears it! That\u2019s a very impressive job. Newman, the Canadian, matches Bradshaw by clearing 4.80, but she failed earlier at 4.50 so stays below the third-placed Briton. Suhr, the American, doesn\u2019t clear it and is out! The best of the best will compete in the women\u2019s 100m final a little later on, then. It should be an absolute belter! Fraser-Pryce, with her multicoloured hair, absolutely destroys it in 10.82. Murielle Ahoure is second, Schippers third and quick enough to qualify for the final. Imani-Lara Lansiquot, the Briton, comes seventh. Shelly Ann Fraser Pryce, three times a world title winner, leads the names about to compete in the third 100m semi-final. Dafne Schippers is here too. I wonder what the athletes think of what should be such an exulted stage being reduced to this, in front of such a sparse crowd. Do they worry about it or feel demeaned, or are they just in the zone? I think you just get on with it and run, ultimately, but what a shame. Off they go and Asher-Smith cruises through in 10.87! She\u2019ll compete in the final; she was well clear of the competition there and looks in superb nick to do some massive damage here. Next in the women\u2019s 100m heat two we see Dina Asher-Smith. She should do well here ... In the pole vote Holly Bradshow clears 4.80 and is now bang in medal contention! I\u2019d say the crowd were going wild here but, as yesterday, vast swathes of the stadium are unoccupied. It\u2019s not on, at all, and does such a massive disservice to this event. Neita says: \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to just wait and see [if I reach the final]. I haven\u2019t had enough time to process it yet. I came here with no other vision than to get to the final so fingers crossed ...\u201d Marie-Josee Ta Lou, the Ivorian, comes through to win in 10.87, with Thompson second at 11.00 and Neita down in fourth after recording 11.18 Now for the women\u2019s 100m semi-final, heat one. Can Great Britain\u2019s Daryll Neita produce something? It\u2019ll be tough: she\u2019s up against the Olympic champion Elaine Thompson, among others, and only the top two guaranteed to go through ... Angelica Bengtsson goes close on 4.80, but still Morris remains the only woman to clear it. That\u2019s until Anzhelika Sidorova, the Russian in neutral colours, who goes over and in some style. There were eight women tied for gold in the pole vault, as nobody had cleared 4.80. America\u2019s Sandy Morris, who lost the Olympics on a count-back, attempts it and clears! She makes a hell of a racket after making it over. She almost screamed the bar off she was so loud as she landed on the mat. The TV camera work has been quite clever tonight, making sure that shots of the crowd are close-ups. That\u2019s been a big story, the lack of crowd at this event. 4.70m has cut down the field in the pole vault, with four athletes losing their place after failing at that height. Angelica Bengtsson of Sweden almost made it five but cleared the third and final attempt. Holly Bradshaw goes for 4.80 and goes out the side. It was untidy, she went too early off the bar. Luckily for her, it\u2019s proving a tough height for the rest of the field. At least that second gun sound has stopped. What was all that about? Few gremlins in the system. The final heat of the 200m goes and it\u2019s Noah Lyles, perhaps the next star of this event, goes, greeting the crowd with an enigmatic point and pout. He\u2019s dyed his hair silver. He looks to his right, thinking he has the race run and is beaten by Jereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago. That\u2019s a misjudgement and means he could be in a semi-final that will be loaded with talent. Watch out for that draw when it is decided. The sixth heat of the 200m sees Andre de Grasse, bronze in the 100m, go for Canada, and jog home, pretty much to win it with plenty in hand. Munyai of South Africa is in second. Sandy Morris, the Olympic silver at pole vault, make a confident clearing of 4.70. Canada\u2019s Alysha Newman makes it over the bar, but is down in eighth after a fault on that lower height of 4.50. Miguel Francis speaks: \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was so close, it\u2019s about getting into the next round. It should be really interesting.\u201d Miguel Francis for Team GB goes in the next 200m heat, the fifth of seven and his upright, relaxed style made sure he stays out of trouble. He had it won, but slowed up to let Aaron Brown of Canada win. That may cost him a good lane in the semi-finals. Kelly Bradshaw clears that 4.70 height in the pole vault as does Olympic champion Katerina Stefanidi of Greece. Both looked comfortable though Stefanidi was the clearer. America\u2019s Silva looked to have cleared the bar on 4.70 only for the bar to fall. She was given the white flag, the benefit of the doubt as it fell after she had left the mat. The fourth heat of the men\u2019s 200m goes with Kenny Bednarek, the 20-year-old from America looking the most likely to before his hamstring goes in the last 40. Kyle Greaux wins the heat, speeding away as Bednarek falters. Yancarlos Martinez comes, with Renier Mena behind in third. The women\u2019s pole vault is under way and Britain\u2019s Holly Bradshaw has cleared the opening height of 4.50, as have the rest of the field, save for America\u2019s Yarisley Silva. 4.70 is the next height, one that is a tough ask for much of the field. Belarus\u2019 Irina Zhuk gets that cleared to equal her national record. The third heat of the 200m sees Jamaica\u2019s Yohan Blake come behind Alex Quinonez from Ecuador who blazed away to win that one. Blake, who bows only to Usain Bolt in 200m times, did not look like he was too likely to relive his glory days. Another factor in athletes\u2019 fatigue may relate to this type of organisation chaos. Zharnel Hughes comes through in second, and behind Xie, to go through. Again, there was that rogue second gunshot. That\u2019s a mystery. Hughes did look to be tying up a little at the end there, and Xie came through stronger. \u201cTonight was just about qualifying. I\u2019ll get treatment and I will be fine. Once I get some rest I will be fine. I didn\u2019t get any sleep because of anti-doping.\u201d He had to be up at 8am having got to sleep at 4am. The next heat has an empty lane 2 where Christian Coleman was supposed to be. Zharnel Hughes carries the British flag here, having finished sixth in the 100m last night and been somewhat disappointed by that. Adam Gemili speaks: \u201cI have been working a lot of mine psychology. This one was mental. I\u2019ll take myself through the rounds and I will see what happens. This was a bit of redemption for yesterday. There was a little bit of fire and wanting to prove.\u201d Gemili wins in 20.06 and looks imperious, particularly off the bend. Guliyev was second to take the second qualifying place into the next round. There was some confusion there as there appeared to be two starters\u2019 guns, indicating a false start, but the runners kept going. Gemili ran his fastest time of the season. All good for him. We begin with the 200m men\u2019s heats and Britain\u2019s Adam Gemili, who was disappointed in not reaching the 100m final is set to go. He goes in the first heat in lane 7. Other news from this event, there will be no Christian Coleman. He\u2019s been scratched but will remain eligible for the relays. His manager told Reuters: \u201cHe is sore from yesterday and didn\u2019t leave the stadium until after 1am. Couldn\u2019t take the strain today.\u201d Last night was all about the 100m men, with Christian Coleman speeding to victory in 9.76 and then having to mount a defence of his reputation after getting away with missing three drugs tests. That\u2019s the way of athletics these days, right? Tonight, it\u2019s the women\u2019s turn in the blue-riband sprint event. British interest will be on Dina Asher-Smith who made short work of the heats. She will have Marie-Josee Ta Lou and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce to beat, though. Two finals in the field, too, with the men\u2019s triple jump and the women\u2019s pole vault to come and some intriguing heats. Here\u2019s the order of events in UK time. 18.05pm | Men\u2019s 200m Heats 18.40pm | Women\u2019s Pole Vault Final 19.20pm | Women\u2019s 100m Semi-Final 19.45pm | Men\u2019s Triple Jump Final 19.55pm | Men\u2019s 800m Semi-Final 20.35pm | Mixed 4x400m Relay Final 21.20pm | Women\u2019s 100m Final 21.30pm | Women\u2019s 20km Race Walk Final",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Stephen Smiley bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 30 September.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>A legal loophole that is depriving migrant workers in Australia of thousands of dollars in unpaid wages is still not closed</strong>,<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/30/legal-loophole-leaves-migrant-workers-with-thousands-of-dollars-in-unpaid-wages\">despite the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/30/legal-loophole-leaves-migrant-workers-with-thousands-of-dollars-in-unpaid-wages\"> government agreeing \u201cin principle\u201d to include the workers in employee protections</a>. Oppressed for his religious beliefs and driven from his job, Fu Cong fled China for a new life in Australia, eventually finding work in a printing company. But after it declared bankruptcy, Cong was left with nothing more than a string of dishonoured pay cheques, and no legal avenue of redress. While the government agreed six months ago to extend a protection known as the Fair Entitlement Guarantee to include migrant workers, it has not yet begun consultation about implementing it. A spokesman for the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, has told Guardian Australia that \u201cdetails of timing and the mechanism for consultation on this proposal will be outlined in due course\u201d.</p> <p><strong>An Alice Springs woman says she was pursued by an external debt collector who warned it could seize her wages or stop her travelling overseas</strong>, all over a $3,700 Centrelink overpayment that a tribunal later found to be entirely caused by the agency\u2019s mistakes. But Emma Delahunty, a single mother of a one-year-old, will be forced to pay back the money. The administrative appeals tribunal last month ruled that the debt would still stand because repaying it would not cause her \u201csevere\u201d financial suffering.</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson has ramped up speculation he is planning to bypass a law that stops the UK from crashing out of the EU without a deal. </strong>In an interview with the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/boris-johnson-fuels-speculation-could-ignore-brexit-delay-law\">Johnson said the UK could still leave the bloc on 31 October</a> despite the passing of the Benn Act, which aims to prevent a no-deal Brexit by forcing him to ask Brussels for a delay. Meanwhile, Downing Street has been forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/no-10-denies-claims-boris-johnson-squeezed-thigh-journalist-charlotte-edwardes\">deny allegations that </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/no-10-denies-claims-boris-johnson-squeezed-thigh-journalist-charlotte-edwardes\"> Johnson squeezed the thigh of a journalist</a> under the table during a private lunch.

The transformation into Ocker Trump is now so obvious that no journalist or media company can miss it.

On Brexit, he has distorted a near trivial \u2018freedom to trade with the rest of the world\u2019 with claptrap about vassalage, sovereignty and patriotism. The idea that Brexit will bring a new dawn of national wealth is absurd.

This phenomenon is most apparent in the world of video games.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Stephen Smiley bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 30 September. Top stories A legal loophole that is depriving migrant workers in Australia of thousands of dollars in unpaid wages is still not closed, despite the government agreeing \u201cin principle\u201d to include the workers in employee protections. Oppressed for his religious beliefs and driven from his job, Fu Cong fled China for a new life in Australia, eventually finding work in a printing company. But after it declared bankruptcy, Cong was left with nothing more than a string of dishonoured pay cheques, and no legal avenue of redress. While the government agreed six months ago to extend a protection known as the Fair Entitlement Guarantee to include migrant workers, it has not yet begun consultation about implementing it. A spokesman for the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, has told Guardian Australia that \u201cdetails of timing and the mechanism for consultation on this proposal will be outlined in due course\u201d. An Alice Springs woman says she was pursued by an external debt collector who warned it could seize her wages or stop her travelling overseas, all over a $3,700 Centrelink overpayment that a tribunal later found to be entirely caused by the agency\u2019s mistakes. But Emma Delahunty, a single mother of a one-year-old, will be forced to pay back the money. The administrative appeals tribunal last month ruled that the debt would still stand because repaying it would not cause her \u201csevere\u201d financial suffering. Boris Johnson has ramped up speculation he is planning to bypass a law that stops the UK from crashing out of the EU without a deal. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, Johnson said the UK could still leave the bloc on 31 October despite the passing of the Benn Act, which aims to prevent a no-deal Brexit by forcing him to ask Brussels for a delay. Meanwhile, Downing Street has been forced to deny allegations that Johnson squeezed the thigh of a journalist under the table during a private lunch. Charlotte Edwardes alleges the incident took place at the offices of the Spectator in London shortly after Johnson became editor there in 1999. World Members of Donald Trump\u2019s army of surrogates have gone into battle, as the beleaguered president seeks to fight back against a rapidly intensifying impeachment inquiry. Trump is accused of seeking dirt that would show that Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, acted corruptly. Houthi rebels in Yemen say they have killed 500 Saudi soldiers, captured a further 2,000 and seized a convoy of Saudi military vehicles. The extraordinary claims were made at a press conference on Sunday and have not been independently verified. Support for Austria\u2019s far-right Freedom party has plunged by more than a third, according to exit polls released after national elections on Sunday. But the party may still retain some power if the leading People\u2019s party, which topped the poll, invites it to join its coalition. Some of Hong Kong\u2019s busiest shopping districts have descended into chaos, after police used teargas, rubber bullets, pepper spray and water cannons against protesters. Elon Musk has unveiled a SpaceX spacecraft designed to carry crew and cargo to the moon, Mars or anywhere else in the solar system and land back on Earth perpendicularly. Opinion and analysis We are at a tipping point on climate change on two fronts \u2013 a point from which there is no return, writes Greg Jericho. The first is action to deal with the climate emergency; the second is for the media to report on it with credibility: \u201cThe prime minister of this country is now suggesting the media are lying about the government\u2019s climate change efforts. I don\u2019t know about the prime minister, but I get my information from the Department of the Environment and Energy, which shows that annual emissions have risen every quarter since the government introduced its \u2018emissions reduction fund\u2019. The transformation into Ocker Trump is now so obvious that no journalist or media company can miss it. The tipping point is here.\u201d Simon Jenkins used to to think Boris Johnson could get a Brexit deal. But after last week, he\u2019s changed his mind: \u201cFrom the moment Johnson began his final climb to power, his appeal has been crudely populist. He has discarded the core Tory tradition of fiscal probity with a welter of spending pledges and tax cuts, plus plans for immigration control and toughness on crime. On Brexit, he has distorted a near trivial \u2018freedom to trade with the rest of the world\u2019 with claptrap about vassalage, sovereignty and patriotism. The idea that Brexit will bring a new dawn of national wealth is absurd. It is simply how Johnson became prime minister.\u201d Sport Damien Hardwick has proved his doubters wrong to become an AFL great, writes Scott Heinrich. Hardwick presided over just eight victories in 2016 and was as good as broken but the transformation he has pulled off since then is now the stuff of Australian football folklore. As a former player, Michael Cheika says he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d at the confusion the crackdown on high tackles is causing in the World Cup, after another match was held up by constant reviews on the big screen. Australia\u2019s head coach was speaking after the Wallabies\u2019 29-25 defeat by Wales. Thinking time: the rapid pace of video game nostalgia One of the stranger side-effects of the breakneck speed of technological advancement is its ability to rapidly generate nostalgia: the greater the speed of change, the greater the volume of outdated technology in its wake. This phenomenon is most apparent in the world of video games. A 20-year-old video game feels far more dated than a 20-year-old novel, and games from the 70s and earlier are quite literally museum pieces. That reality is a key theme at Game Masters, the video game exhibition that launched at Acmi in 2012 and has now, after seven years touring the world, found its way to Canberra. Eighty games, all playable, are arranged in a chronological history that starts with original Space Invaders and Pac-Man arcade cabinets and finishes with a selection from the vast choice available to players in 2019. But seeing this show as just a nostalgic day out for gamers would sell it short: it\u2019s also a way to trace the evolution of a form that, only now, is starting to be taken seriously. Media roundup The Reserve Bank is poised to take interest rates below 1%, the Sydney Morning Herald reports, even as evidence grows its previous rate cuts have supercharged the Sydney and Melbourne property markets. In a new twist to the saga of the Australian Jock Palfreeman, 292 Bulgarian judges have signed a letter defending the appellate court\u2019s decision to grant him parole, the ABC reports. And the Australian reports that the NDIA has overseen a threefold spending increase on contractors, recruiters and lawyers as it copes with a flood of new participants.

In fact, I see so much about this Japan side that is similar to how the Highlanders played when they won the Super Rugby title in 2015 under Joseph and Brown.</p> \n<p>Tony has an ability to give players the confidence to play what they see, the courage to act on the pictures that are good, whether that\u2019s run pictures, kick pictures or offload pictures. It can look effortless on the pitch but so much work goes into perfecting it in training. I\u2019m sure they make a lot of mistakes in training and it makes you want to pull your hair out but you see that when it transfers into games it cause opponents a lot of problems.</p> \n<p>Whether it was going down the short side or little attacking kicks over the top, it was the variety that made life so difficult for Ireland. Andy Farrell has created one of the world\u2019s best defensive sides but Ireland had a lot of trouble getting their usual line speed and that is a credit to the Japan coaches. Ireland were just not able to cut down Japan\u2019s time and space as the game wore on. Fitness was a big factor, too. Towards the end of the match it was Japan who were on top, looking like they would close the game out, save for a few nervy moments at the end.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1fd88407-1383-4cb7-86e9-13d8056a875e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HwwLk9cLKqI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Going back to the comparison with the Highlanders of a few years ago, the similarities I see are a lot of moving the point of the attack, not just playing round the corner with forwards, as you see from England, because Japan simply don\u2019t have that in their locker. They\u2019ve got electric, quick-footed, explosive players and they need to maximise that threat. They are not going to bash down a side with absolute physicality, they have to move them around and Tony knows that. So you see little trick starter-plays off lineouts, they are very innovative off scrums, they\u2019ll go wide a lot, often putting their back row wide to fill the field. A two-four-two type play, or a one-three-one and they get guys like Michael Leitch and Kazuki Himeno heavily involved in the wide channels.</p> \n<p>You also have to look at how Japan are almost always trying to keep the ball on the field. They want the ball in play time to be as high as possible. Eddie Jones said during the Six Nations that after a visit from the Japan coaches they had said that they were aiming for the ball in play time to be nearly 50 minutes. That\u2019s incredibly high \u2013 in the Premiership it is somewhere around 40-42 minutes. But again it\u2019s about utilising their strengths.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/28/japan-ireland-rugby-world-cup-match-report\">Japan stun Ireland to pull off another famous Rugby World Cup upset</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>They do not have the tools in their tool\u2011belts to be a set-piece team. If a game becomes set-piece-oriented then Japan will be worn down. I thought that was how Ireland would set about things after their fast start but, without the direction from Johnny Sexton, Japan made sure they didn\u2019t allow them to.

      "bodyText": "I played with Tony Brown at the Highlanders and watching Japan\u2019s stunning victory against Ireland I could see the extent of the influence he has as Jamie Joseph\u2019s assistant. In fact, I see so much about this Japan side that is similar to how the Highlanders played when they won the Super Rugby title in 2015 under Joseph and Brown. Tony has an ability to give players the confidence to play what they see, the courage to act on the pictures that are good, whether that\u2019s run pictures, kick pictures or offload pictures. It can look effortless on the pitch but so much work goes into perfecting it in training. I\u2019m sure they make a lot of mistakes in training and it makes you want to pull your hair out but you see that when it transfers into games it cause opponents a lot of problems. Whether it was going down the short side or little attacking kicks over the top, it was the variety that made life so difficult for Ireland. Andy Farrell has created one of the world\u2019s best defensive sides but Ireland had a lot of trouble getting their usual line speed and that is a credit to the Japan coaches. Ireland were just not able to cut down Japan\u2019s time and space as the game wore on. Fitness was a big factor, too. Towards the end of the match it was Japan who were on top, looking like they would close the game out, save for a few nervy moments at the end. Going back to the comparison with the Highlanders of a few years ago, the similarities I see are a lot of moving the point of the attack, not just playing round the corner with forwards, as you see from England, because Japan simply don\u2019t have that in their locker. They\u2019ve got electric, quick-footed, explosive players and they need to maximise that threat. They are not going to bash down a side with absolute physicality, they have to move them around and Tony knows that. So you see little trick starter-plays off lineouts, they are very innovative off scrums, they\u2019ll go wide a lot, often putting their back row wide to fill the field. A two-four-two type play, or a one-three-one and they get guys like Michael Leitch and Kazuki Himeno heavily involved in the wide channels. You also have to look at how Japan are almost always trying to keep the ball on the field. They want the ball in play time to be as high as possible. Eddie Jones said during the Six Nations that after a visit from the Japan coaches they had said that they were aiming for the ball in play time to be nearly 50 minutes. That\u2019s incredibly high \u2013 in the Premiership it is somewhere around 40-42 minutes. But again it\u2019s about utilising their strengths. They do not have the tools in their tool\u2011belts to be a set-piece team. If a game becomes set-piece-oriented then Japan will be worn down. I thought that was how Ireland would set about things after their fast start but, without the direction from Johnny Sexton, Japan made sure they didn\u2019t allow them to. It was hugely impressive because not only does the skill level have to be extremely high but the players need to be able to execute under the utmost pressure and the utmost fatigue. The thing that pleased me the most about Japan\u2019s performance was that they did not go into their shells, or start to think that they had to change the way they were playing. It was a fast start by Ireland, Japan would have been expecting that, and then Yu Tamura missed a straightforward shot at goal. But there was some real mental resilience and that goes back to 2015. They beat the Springboks but all of a sudden Jones, their then coach, moves on and it would have been very easy for Japan to take a backwards step.

It feels dry and so hot but the ball feels like there\u2019s been torrential rain. It\u2019s taken us time to get used to it.

When I was younger I was probably very selfish and quite arrogant ... looking back I was nowhere near as good as I thought I was. When I wasn\u2019t playing I always thought it was someone else\u2019s fault. The coach doesn\u2019t like me, this is rubbish. I was lucky that Adam Jones came to the club. He gave me a little kick up the backside and then Eddie gave me a chance.\u201d</p> <p>Sinckler remains particularly grateful to Jones for backing players like himself and the Northampton flanker Lewis Ludlam on relatively flimsy evidence. \u201cBefore that Australia tour I think I started one game for Quins that year.

      "bodyText": "England are backing their forward \u201ctank\u201d to propel them past Argentina this weekend and confirm their place in the last eight. While the Pumas possess a decent set-piece and a good driving maul, the English pack are more than braced for the challenge and believe their tight forwards are a steadily developing force. As the USA discovered in Kobe much time and effort has gone into trying to restore England\u2019s reputation as a forward powerhouse and their Lions prop Kyle Sinckler says it remains top of Eddie Jones\u2019s list of priorities. \u201cOne of the first things when I got into camp was the English DNA. It is something we put massive emphasis on as a forward pack,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just gets our game going when our tank \u2013 our maul and our scrum \u2013 get going. We get into a good flow and a good rhythm. It\u2019s something, especially in the first 20-30 minutes, we always try to get our teeth stuck into. Eddie is always on to us as a pack to assert ourselves through our scrum. I don\u2019t know how much more we could do, we put so much into it each week.\u201d Argentina\u2019s narrow defeat against France in their opening pool game, however, has forced the Pumas into a tight corner, effectively needing to win what their head coach, Mario Ledesma, describes as \u201cour final\u201d to reach the quarter-finals. \u201cWe are under no illusion it is going to be a really tough game,\u201d Sinckler said. \u201cThey are playing for their lives.\u201d The other big hurdle will be the heat and humidity, to which Sinckler is still acclimatising. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like it before \u2013 the heat and how relentless it is. It feels dry and so hot but the ball feels like there\u2019s been torrential rain. It\u2019s taken us time to get used to it. As forwards, you might just have to adjust your running lines, where you are taking the ball, how flat you are taking it. The conditions have been testing so far.\u201d When the going gets tough, though, Sinckler is increasingly well equipped to deal with the challenge. It is only three years ago that he was struggling to win a regular place in Harlequins\u2019 starting XV, since when he has toured New Zealand with the British and Irish Lions and become an England regular. \u201cIt\u2019s been one hell of a journey from when I couldn\u2019t even get a start for Quins,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I think that\u2019s my biggest work-on: to reflect and give myself a little pat on the back for five to 10 seconds. When I was younger I was probably very selfish and quite arrogant ... looking back I was nowhere near as good as I thought I was. When I wasn\u2019t playing I always thought it was someone else\u2019s fault. The coach doesn\u2019t like me, this is rubbish. I was lucky that Adam Jones came to the club. He gave me a little kick up the backside and then Eddie gave me a chance.\u201d Sinckler remains particularly grateful to Jones for backing players like himself and the Northampton flanker Lewis Ludlam on relatively flimsy evidence. \u201cBefore that Australia tour I think I started one game for Quins that year. I was lucky it all fell into place at the right time. If it hadn\u2019t I don\u2019t know where my career would have gone. It just takes that one person to believe in you and give you a chance. Look at the likes of Lewis Ludlam ... he hasn\u2019t looked out of place and has done extremely well. Eddie can find a diamond in the rough, so to speak.\u201d Over in the Argentina camp, the mood is slightly downbeat following a flat second-half performance against Tonga on Saturday. The Pumas failed to register a point after half-time in their 28-12 win and their captain Pablo Matera accepts they will have to raise their game \u201cin many aspects\u201d to topple England. \u201cI haven\u2019t watched the game again but I know this isn\u2019t going to be enough,\u201d said the former Leicester flanker. \u201cIf we lose again we are going home. It\u2019s going to have to be better.\u201d",

He indicated that Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community who alerted Congress to an \u201curgent concern\u201d in the whistleblower complaint, would be called to testify in private. Schiff and other Democrats hope that will allow Atkinson to hand over names of key White House witnesses.</p> <p>Two diplomats are also likely to be called to testify this week: Kurt Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/27/mike-pompeo-subpoena-documents-trump-ukraine\">resigned on Friday</a>, and Marie Yovanovitch, who was pulled from her post as ambassador in Kyiv last May in what was widely seen as a <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/07/us-ambassador-to-ukraine-recalled-in-political-hit-job-lawmakers-say-marie-yovanovitch-lutsenko-right-wing-media-accusations-congress-diplomats-diplomacy/\">political hit job</a>.</p> <p>At the core of the impeachment battle is Trump\u2019s push to coerce the Ukraine government to investigate conspiracy theories relating to top Democrats. According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/26/whistleblower-trump-ukraine-read-in-full-text-document\">nine-page complaint</a> filed by the whistleblower, an unidentified member of the intelligence services, \u201cthe president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election\u201d.</p> <p>Trump is accused of seeking dirt that would show that Biden acted corruptly in 2016 in his role as vice-president by pressuring Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor. According to the Trump narrative, the prosecutor was targeted because he was investigating a Ukrainian company on whose board sat Biden\u2019s son Hunter.</p> <p>In fact, Biden was one of many European and western leaders who wanted the prosecutor gone because he was failing to tackle corruption. Former chief prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko repeated <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-09-29/former-ukraine-prosecutor-says-no-wrongdoing-biden\">to the Los Angeles Times on Sunday</a><strong> </strong>his view that no wrongdoing by either Biden has been found.</p> <p>One of the most highly charged decisions facing Democrats will be whether to call Giuliani to testify. Asked by ABC if he would appear, Giuliani said he would \u201cconsider\u201d it, but only if Schiff were removed.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t cooperate with Adam Schiff,\u201d the former mayor said. \u201cI think Adam Schiff should be removed.

Two diplomats are also likely to be called to testify this week: Kurt Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine who resigned on Friday, and Marie Yovanovitch, who was pulled from her post as ambassador in Kyiv last May in what was widely seen as a political hit job. At the core of the impeachment battle is Trump\u2019s push to coerce the Ukraine government to investigate conspiracy theories relating to top Democrats. According to the nine-page complaint filed by the whistleblower, an unidentified member of the intelligence services, \u201cthe president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election\u201d. Trump is accused of seeking dirt that would show that Biden acted corruptly in 2016 in his role as vice-president by pressuring Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor. According to the Trump narrative, the prosecutor was targeted because he was investigating a Ukrainian company on whose board sat Biden\u2019s son Hunter. In fact, Biden was one of many European and western leaders who wanted the prosecutor gone because he was failing to tackle corruption. Former chief prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko repeated to the Los Angeles Times on Sunday his view that no wrongdoing by either Biden has been found. One of the most highly charged decisions facing Democrats will be whether to call Giuliani to testify. Asked by ABC if he would appear, Giuliani said he would \u201cconsider\u201d it, but only if Schiff were removed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t cooperate with Adam Schiff,\u201d the former mayor said. \u201cI think Adam Schiff should be removed. If they remove Adam Schiff, if they put a neutral person who hasn\u2019t prejudged the case \u2026\u201d Schiff said the decision on Giuliani would be made \u201cdown the road\u201d. Giuliani reserved his harshest words for the whistleblower and Biden. The \u201cso-called whistleblower\u201d, a denigrating description that has become a Trump staple, had he claimed said \u201cfive things that were totally false. I\u2019m not saying he was false, he could have heard it wrong \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s hearsay.\u201d The Trump circle is accusing the whistleblower of hearsay because he was not present for the 25 July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump said the now notorious words: \u201cI want you to do us a favor though.\u201d In fact, the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is not hearsay \u2013 following protocol it draws on eyewitness accounts by direct participants. Regardless, Jim Jordan, a pugnacious congressman from Ohio, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cThis individual had no firsthand knowledge, he heard something from somebody.\u201d In a feisty exchange, host Jake Tapper said: \u201cThe president was pushing the president of Ukraine to investigate a political rival. I cannot believe that is OK with you.\u201d Jordan replied: \u201cIt is not OK, but he didn\u2019t do that.\u201d Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s far-right senior adviser, told Fox News Sunday the complaint was a \u201clittle Nancy Drew novel\u201d and the whistleblower a member of the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2013 another Trump conspiracy theory. In fact, the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was found to \u201cappear credible\u201d by the inspector general, who was appointed by Trump. Fox News Sunday also reported that Giuliani \u201cwas not the only attorney trying to get damaging information on Joe Biden from Ukrainian officials\u201d. Citing an anonymous US official, the report said two more lawyers, Joe DiGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing, worked with Giuliani \u201coff the books\u201d on Ukraine, meaning only Trump knows what they did. Trump appears to be losing the appeal to public opinion. A new CBS News poll found that 55% of Americans approve of the decision to open an impeachment inquiry. But the poll suggests Democrats have work to do. Only 42% said they thought Trump deserved to be impeached, with 36% saying he did not and 22% undecided. Schiff told ABC: \u201cThe president of the United States used the full weight of his office to try and coerce [Ukraine] to manufacture dirt on his opponent and interfere with our election.\u201d Senator Cory Booker told CNN Trump acted \u201cless like the leader of the free world and more like a dictator or thug in using American power to pursue his own personal gain\u201d.",

In early September, the Conservatives reversed years of cuts and announced 20,000 new officers over three years at a cost of \u00a3750m in the first year. But the 43 forces in England and Wales who are supposed to recruit 6,000 officers in the first wave still do not know how much money they will receive and how many officers they can afford to recruit.

Those trying to recruit fear it will delay providing enough officers to tackle the rising level of serious crime.

Conservatives on the London Assembly previously said Khan was \u201cpleading poverty\u201d about the lack of money for police while Met police spending on flights and hotels had increased sharply. The Conservatives on the Greater London Assembly seized on figures showing \u00a34.6m was spent on flights last year, an increase of 80% compared with \u00a32.5m spent in 2015/16 when Khan came into power.

      "bodyText": "Former chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s attack on Boris Johnson\u2019s hedge-fund backers has been supported by a former top Treasury civil servant, as financial experts raise concerns over the PM\u2019s links to the City. Nick Macpherson, former permanent secretary to the Treasury, said Hammond was right to question the political connections of some of the hedge funds with a financial interest in no deal. \u201cThey are shorting the pound and the country, with the British people the main loser,\u201d Macpherson warned, after Hammond wrote that some of Johnson\u2019s City supporters have bet billions of pounds on a hard Brexit. Hammond also claimed over the weekend that such funds would be happy to see \u201cscant progress\u201d ahead of the 31 October deadline to leave the EU, or seek an extension. One government minister was quick to dismiss Hammond\u2019s allegations, but they raised fears that the prime minister faces a conflict of interest. \u201cMany hedge-fund managers see Brexit (including the no-deal variety) as an opportunity from which they obviously hope to profit, and they are positioning their portfolios accordingly,\u201d said financial commentator and author Frances Coppola. Johnson received five-figure donations from several leading fund managers during the Conservative leadership race, some of whom also backed the Leave campaign. \u201cThose who donated to Johnson\u2019s campaign aren\u2019t necessarily trying to influence policy: they may simply see him as the best hope of getting the Brexit they want. But financial backing from people who hope to profit from Brexit creates a conflict of interest for Johnson, since it puts psychological pressure on Johnson to deliver what his backers want rather than what is in the best interests of the country,\u201d Coppola warned. The Financial Conduct Authority declined to comment on Hammond\u2019s claim. The FCA is responsible for regulating short-selling in the UK. This is the practice by which investors bet against a stock by borrowing its shares, selling them, and hoping to buy them back at a cheaper price. The FCA maintains a database of short positions, which show that more than 130 investors have built up more than 500 bets against London-listed companies, such as outsourcing group Kier and motoring assistance group AA. For example, Odey Asset Management has taken short positions against homebuilder Berkeley Group and shopping centre landlord Intu. The property sector is seen as particularly vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit, which would hurt consumer spending and deter people from moving house. City grandee and hedge fund manger Crispin Odey, who runs the fund, has publicly backed Boris Johnson and supported Brexit. But Odey also holds short positions in Debenhams and Metro Bank, who are both under pressure due to non-Brexit issues. Also, so-called \u2018long/short\u2019 fund managers, such as Odey, often bet against a particular company by shorting it, and buying its rivals. This strategy can pay off regardless of macro-economic conditions, if the company in question underperforms the rest of the sector. The Financial Times has disputed the notion that a no-deal Brexit is a hedge fund conspiracy. \u201cEquity outcomes are explicitly uncertain \u2013 what is a short position on a \u201cno deal Brexit\u201d? A short position on any company? A short position could also be a play on remain. For instance, a company might benefit from a stronger dollar, or less EU regulation,\u201d FT Alphaville explained. The pound plunged after the 2016 referendum, and typically weakens whenever a no-deal Brexit looks more likely. Bets against sterling have soared since the EU referendum, hitting a two-year high in August according to data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But this may indicate that investors are trying to protect themselves from Brexit, as much as to profit from it. Hammond said in the Times that \u201cJohnson is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit \u2013 and there is only one option that works for them: a crash-out no-deal that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring.\u201d Business minister Nadhim Zahawi claimed this \u201cugly smear\u201d was completely untrue. The claim has also been promoted by the prime minister\u2019s sister, Rachel. She told the BBC\u2019s World At One that \u201cpeople who have invested billions in shorting the pound or shorting the country in the expectation of a no-deal Brexit\u201d could be driving the government\u2019s strategy. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has written to the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, asking if there may be a conflict of interest in Johnson\u2019s acceptance of support from hedge funds that could gain from an economic shock. The financial markets have become increasingly jittery about Brexit risks in recent months, following Johnson\u2019s claim that Britain would leave the EU on 31 October \u2018do or die\u2019. Earlier this month, the Byline Times claimed that Johnson\u2019s backers had taken more than \u00a38bn of \u201caggregate short positions\u201d against the pound. However, its claim that hedge funds had recently ramped up their short positions was dismissed by Full Fact, the independent fact-checking charity.",

He definitely gets gold for giving it both barrels and maintaining a slightly constipated facial expression throughout. Bags of attitude, some decent Salsa basics, a bit lacking in the shimmy and hip action but good fun nonetheless.

This week they\u2019re dancing the Salsa to 1-2-3 by Gloria Estefan. This is solid gold 80s classic, and I\u2019m hoping Will is going to wrap up the night with full wedding dancefloor abandon. If you were doing the Salsa on Strictly, you\u2019d have a drink or two beforehand, surely? I\u2019d have to be at least two G&amp;Ts deep for any kind of shimmy. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8fb70c8f08fbb0c171d518\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-28T19:40:39.564Z\">8.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Scores: 7,7,7,7 - a total of 28 for Kelvin and Oti.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8fb6f18f08fbb0c171d517\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-28T19:39:52.481Z\">8.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bruno really felt it, and has finally lost his marbles - for such a big hulk, Kelvin is so light on his feet. Craig thought Kelvin needs to watch his hands out of hold, and his bottom was sticking out. Motsi thought it had a beautiful atmosphere, but Kelvin needs to relax his shoulders. Shirley had issues with Kelvin\u2019s footwork at the beginning, and it wasn\u2019t the best frame of the night, but there\u2019s no disputing Kelvin\u2019s talent. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8fb6428f08fbb0c171d512\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-28T19:36:39.585Z\">8.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Kelvin\u2019s decided to dance on his own, because who needs Oti? Oh there she is, looking divine as usual. This is delightful, if a little patchy in the footwork occasionally. Still, dry ice is covering up most of it (DRINK).

There\u2019s no question that Kelvin has hips to spare (still pushing my eyeballs back in after last week), so now we need to know if he can deliver style and elegance in ballroom too.

Bruno liked the sass and the spark, but better foot placement would have given Alex better hip action. Craig thought it was stompy and it was a bit more Saturday Night Fever than Cha Cha Cha. Motsi liked the way Alex took a risk and she needs to keep that fire burning. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d8fb49e8f081108db9be9dd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-28T19:29:36.406Z\">8.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Alex looks incredible in a strappy white dress, and there\u2019s some nice chemistry between her and Neil. She definitely looks more confident than I expected for her first Latin \u2013 Alex is clearly enjoying herself and giving it some welly. She needs to lift her head and there are a few timing issues, but great fun.

Shirley thought Mike had a beautiful smile but it wasn\u2019t an American Smooth \u2013 it lacked flow and style. Bruno wasn\u2019t sure Katya was going to survive \u2013 the nation isn\u2019t ready.

The cowboy skit at the beginning goes on for hours, which is just as well because the dancing is very much not my cup of tea.

At least I think he said bucking, it\u2019s hard to know. The dance wasn\u2019t better than last week, but James\u2019 personality definitely was. Motsi agrees, this week James clearly had fun, but he needs to work on the dancing. Shirley thought James really struggled with the content, but with determination he will improve.

Feel free to give this brand new liveblog feature a better name than oh, I don\u2019t know, Heidi\u2019s Hunches. </p> <p><strong>Group 1: driving for December </strong>\u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni, Karim and Amy, Dev and Dianne, Saffron and AJ</p> <p><strong>Group 2: battling for Blackpool </strong>\u2013 Emma B and Anton, Emma W and Aljaz, Alex and Neil, Catherine and Johannes, Will and Janette</p> <p><strong>Group 3: happy to see Halloween </strong>\u2013 Chris and Karen, Mike and Katya</p> <p><strong>Group 4: dodging the dance-off </strong>\u2013 David and Nadiya, James and Luba, Anneka and Kevin</p> <p>Kick-off is at 6.40pm; the show is a whole 10 minutes shorter than last week, but still a hefty two hours and nine minutes so bring wit, sparkle and a fully-stocked picnic basket to the comment box below.

      "bodyText": "James and Luba take to the floor for their final dance to \u2018Don\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over\u2019 by Crowded House. Aww. So that\u2019s it for this week\u2019s Strictly! Next week is MOVIE WEEK, so dig out your best Hollywood fancy dress and I\u2019ll see you at 7.10pm. Personally I\u2019m thinking Grace Kelly in To Catch A Thief, but you do you. Have a fab week! Hx Which means JAMES AND LUBA are going home. That\u2019s a shame, James had a certain hapless charm and I really wanted to see more of Luba. But good news for David, he lives to dance another week. Craig saves David and Nadiya, because they \u2018improved beyond compare\u2019. Motsi and Bruno do likewise, because apparently that was a transformation from yesterday\u2019s Paso. I may have to watch the two again. HA, only joking. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s time to watch David do some lacklustre caping in his Mogadon Paso. What joy. Time to watch James flip pancakes again, then provide a sturdy tartan pole for Luba to dance around. He\u2019s definitely doing some steps, but they\u2019re not the right ones and they\u2019re definitely in the wrong order. I love him, can he please stay? This is actually quite a tough one to call \u2013 both James and David are so wooden they belong in the National Arboretum, but actually I thought James was more entertaining last night, so he might edge it. But equally James is clearly struggling (as well he might, hard for any of us to know how his brain injury affects his coordination), so the judges might decide to set him free. So who is joining James and Luba in tonight\u2019s dance off? Alex and Neil are safe, along with Catherine and Johannes, Emma and Aljaz and Anneka and Kevin! Anneka looks stunned. Which means David and Nadiya are in tonight\u2019s first dance off, providing further evidence (if it were needed) that this dance business is Very Hard for a Tall Man. Can we just take a moment to celebrate Motsi? She\u2019s outstanding, I love her. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of West Lothian singer/songwriter Lewis Capaldi. He\u2019s like the new Ed Sheeran, even though the old Ed Sheeran hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. Ooh, lovely barefoot contempo-waft from Aljaz and Janette. \u201cGive it your best, so when you go home you can say you did everything possible\u201d, says Motsi. IF you go home, surely? I fear James\u2019 taxi is running. Also through to next week \u2013 Saffron and AJ, Chris and Karen, Kelvin and Oti and Emma and Anton. First couple in the bottom two (finally) \u2013 JAMES AND LUBA. Well, that\u2019s not really a surprise. Michelle and Giovanni are safe (THANKYEWWWW), along with Dev and Dianne, Mike and Katya, Karim and Amy and Will and Janette. First couple in the bottom two\u2026revealed later in the show. Oh for heaven\u2019s sake. So who is safely through to next week? As usual, enjoy the theatrical expressions of relief from people who know full well they\u2019re not going anywhere. It\u2019s the Strictly way. PREVIOUSLY ON STRICTLY: the Difficult Second Week. A few movers (Karim, Michelle, Dev), a few shakers (David, James), a lot somewhere in the middle, and an American Smooth from Mike and Katya that 100% justifies retaining EU Health &amp; Safety legislation. Also, a heads up: it\u2019s MOVIE WEEK next week, just in case nobody mentions it. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in black velvet with (SHOCK) both shoulders and a straight hem, Claudia in fabulous sequinned trousers and voluminous sleeves. Both look excellent. This week\u2019s opening pro dance has a hotel bar theme, featuring Oti banging out some hot Latin moves to a weird acoustic version of Daniel Bedingfield\u2019s \u2018Gotta Get Thru This\u2019. It sounds terrible, but it\u2019s kind of amazing. No idea who flamenco Nick Cave is, but I\u2019m loving the drama. And we\u2019re off! Our first Results Show of the season! Exciting. We may or may not be subjected to the remnants of Hurricane Lorenzo, Ben is very much straddling the fence on this matter. Time for the weather for the week ahead! This week\u2019s Countryfile Casual Weatherperson is the dashing Ben Rich in full Cotton Eye Joe plaid and denim. This week is looking a bit wet. Just out of interest, how is rambling any different from \u2018going for a walk\u2019? Lovely to see Countryfile back in its traditional pre-Strictly slot, and to see Craven already plugging next year\u2019s calendar. Feels like a warm, comforting bath. WAIT, the harvest mouse picture was STAGED with an actor mouse? I don\u2019t know what to believe any more. Maybe those seals never died in that storm. Evening all, and welcome back to the very first Strictly Sunday results show! Tonight we need to send our first couple home \u2013 based on dance ability alone, it should be James and Luba vs. David and Nadiya in the dance off, but I suspect the public might have a special place in their heart for James, so we\u2019ll see. Kick off is at 7.15pm, see you then! I\u2019ll be back tomorrow at 7.15pm for the Results Show, so please join me here then \u2013 or swing by Twitter and say hi, I\u2019m @heidistephens. It looks like Countryfile is back where it belongs in its pre-Strictly slot, so there may be a short period of liveblog chat about sheep husbandry, forest management and the chosen attire of the Countryfile Casual Weatherperson if you turn up early doors. Thanks all for joining in, and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow! Time for a recap \u2013 Michelle and Giovanni would get my votes this evening if I actually had time to vote, but I\u2019ll spend the next half an hour adding pictures and checking for typos. Has to be James and David in the bottom two, although wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was Anneka. We\u2019ll find out tomorrow, unless you\u2019re one of those people who stays up for the online spoiler. Personally I prefer the surprise, but whatever floats your Strictly boat \u2013 just please don\u2019t give away the result in the comment box. So that\u2019s IT for the dancing \u2013 Karim and Amy are at the top of the leaderboard, and James and Luba are at the bottom. The voting is OPEN, so vote vote vote! Scores: 6,6,6,6 - a total of 24 for Will and Janette. Craig loved the lifts, although Will was ahead of the beat in places. Motsi couldn\u2019t have asked for more and she loved it. Shirley loved Will\u2019s 150% commitment, he is what Strictly is all about. Bruno loved the energy and enthusiasm, and Will is inspiring him. Will\u2019s bought his ping pong bat out this week, as is traditional in the Salsa. He definitely gets gold for giving it both barrels and maintaining a slightly constipated facial expression throughout. Bags of attitude, some decent Salsa basics, a bit lacking in the shimmy and hip action but good fun nonetheless. Enjoyed that. And finally, it\u2019s WILL AND JANETTE! This week they\u2019re dancing the Salsa to 1-2-3 by Gloria Estefan. This is solid gold 80s classic, and I\u2019m hoping Will is going to wrap up the night with full wedding dancefloor abandon. If you were doing the Salsa on Strictly, you\u2019d have a drink or two beforehand, surely? I\u2019d have to be at least two G&amp;Ts deep for any kind of shimmy. Scores: 7,7,7,7 - a total of 28 for Kelvin and Oti. Bruno really felt it, and has finally lost his marbles - for such a big hulk, Kelvin is so light on his feet. Craig thought Kelvin needs to watch his hands out of hold, and his bottom was sticking out. Motsi thought it had a beautiful atmosphere, but Kelvin needs to relax his shoulders. Shirley had issues with Kelvin\u2019s footwork at the beginning, and it wasn\u2019t the best frame of the night, but there\u2019s no disputing Kelvin\u2019s talent. Kelvin\u2019s decided to dance on his own, because who needs Oti? Oh there she is, looking divine as usual. This is delightful, if a little patchy in the footwork occasionally. Still, dry ice is covering up most of it (DRINK). A lovely romantic Waltz, nice work Kelvin. Only two left! Next up it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! Tonight they\u2019re dancing the Waltz to \u2018What the World Needs Now\u2019 by Burt Bacharach. There\u2019s no question that Kelvin has hips to spare (still pushing my eyeballs back in after last week), so now we need to know if he can deliver style and elegance in ballroom too. If so, Kelvin is going to be the one to watch this season. KELVIN\u2019S NAN! DRINK! Scores: 4,6,6,6 - a total of 22 for Alex and Neil. Shirley liked the energy and chemistry, but it was a bit flat in the feet and it needed better rhythm. Bruno liked the sass and the spark, but better foot placement would have given Alex better hip action. Craig thought it was stompy and it was a bit more Saturday Night Fever than Cha Cha Cha. Motsi liked the way Alex took a risk and she needs to keep that fire burning. Alex looks incredible in a strappy white dress, and there\u2019s some nice chemistry between her and Neil. She definitely looks more confident than I expected for her first Latin \u2013 Alex is clearly enjoying herself and giving it some welly. She needs to lift her head and there are a few timing issues, but great fun. Enjoyed that very much. OK, I need that wiped from my memory. Who\u2019s next? It\u2019s ALEX AND NEIL! Their Week 2 dance is the Cha Cha to \u2018What I Did For Love\u2019 by David Guetta feat. Emeli Sande. There were a few timing issues in their Quickstep last week, but I\u2019m hoping we\u2019re about to meet Alex\u2019s inner Latin goddess. Scores: 3,4,3,4 - a total of 14 for Mike and Katya. Please don\u2019t make me watch that again tomorrow. Motsi just watched two different shows, it needed to be fun all the way through. Shirley thought Mike had a beautiful smile but it wasn\u2019t an American Smooth \u2013 it lacked flow and style. Bruno wasn\u2019t sure Katya was going to survive \u2013 the nation isn\u2019t ready. Craig thought it was odd, and that\u2019s all he can say. Whoever chose that outfit for Mike clearly hates him, it\u2019s horrible. The cowboy skit at the beginning goes on for hours, which is just as well because the dancing is very much not my cup of tea. Ugly lifts, clunky transitions, fear of Katya dying, not recognisable as an American Smooth, generally all over the shop. NOPE. Next up it\u2019s MIKE AND KATYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the American Smooth to \u2018Rhinestone Cowboy\u2019 by Glen Campbell. This is highly unlikely to be smooth, so I\u2019m guessing Katya has decided to double down on the American. Scores: 8,8,8,8 - a total of 32 for Karim and Amy. ISN\u2019T HE CUTE?, wails Tess. Stop it. Craig thought it was brilliant, Karim is definitely one to watch. Motsi agrees \u2013 Hollywood classy and elegant. Karim is definitely ticking Shirley\u2019s boxes (OKAAAAY BIT WEIRD) and Bruno thought it was exceptional \u2013 Karim is like a young Gene Kelly. Karim has bags of style in this Foxtrot, and leads this dance masterfully. Nice footwork, great musicality and pace. That was a classy effort, really enjoyed that. It\u2019s time for KARIM AND AMY! This week they\u2019re dancing the Foxtrot to \u2018The Way You Look Tonight\u2019 by Frank Sinatra. Karim has already shown us his moves, but can he deliver some classy ballroom without faffing about with it? Amy needs to keep things simple, or Karim is high risk for a Shock Merrygold Exit. Scores: 2,3,2,3 - a total of 10 for David and Nadiya. Imagine being judged to be worse than James Cracknell. Brutal. Bruno thought it wasn\u2019t quite Real Madrid, and more Sunday league in the park. I though my metaphor was better, but sure. Craig thought it was limp, lame and lacklustre. Motsi saw one or two steps, but the dancing is not there yet. Shirley thought it needed more energy, but David needs to turn up his bodily volume. Nadiya looks entirely fierce, but David\u2019s caping is less \u2018matador in Madrid\u2019 and more \u2018man shaking a beach towel in Minehead\u2019. Also he keeps forgetting to do his Paso face and starts smiling. Generally terrible, but entertainingly so. Next up it\u2019s DAVID AND NADIYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Paso Doble to \u2018Espa\u00f1a ca\u00f1\u00ed\u2019, which is proper Paso music that requires masterful stamping and cape-waving. I think David could be in serious trouble this weekend, only James Cracknell jiving in lead boots can save him. Are we there yet? Oh lord, still six to go. Scores: 8,8,8,8 - a total of 32 for Michelle and Giovanni. Shirley thought Michelle went from sassy last week to classy this week. Bruno loved the storytelling, and it had lovely details. Craig thought it was beautiful, and Motsi agrees \u2013 Michelle\u2019s posture and timing were lovely. So Giovanni is looking adorable as a gondolier, whilst Michelle is dressed as a patio umbrella. There\u2019s some brief grappling over an oar, but generally this is rather charming with some lovely footwork and excellent spinning from Michelle. I loved that, it was OARSOME. Look, it\u2019s already been a really long evening. Oh thank goodness, it\u2019s time for MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI! Their second week dance is the: Viennese Waltz to \u2018That\u2019s Amore\u2019 by Dean Martin. I very much hope this is going to have extra cheese, a stuffed crust and a tray of martinis on the side. This week feels a bit like hard work, I hope they\u2019re saving the best for the second half. Scores: 4,5,5,5 - a total of 19 for Catherine and Johannes. Motsi thought it was hot, but Catherine\u2019s posture was a bit upright. Shirley loved the technical content but it was a bit ahead of the music in places. Bruno thought Catherine lost the rhythm which meant she didn\u2019t have the right bounce. Craig thought it was more like a Salsa, and it didn\u2019t really work. OK this is more like it. Johannes has hypnotic hips, how can I possibly watch Catherine? She\u2019s making a decent effort, but it needs more fire and party abandon. Something seems to go a bit wrong in the middle , but her energy rallies at the end. Not a patch on Kelvin and Oti\u2019s samba last week, but Johannes is a treat. How do you follow that? Come on, this show needs a bit of fizz. Next up it\u2019s CATHERINE AND JOHANNES! This week they\u2019re dancing the Samba to \u2018Let the Groove Get In\u2019 by Justin Timberlake. This was Justin\u2019s brief 2013 foray into a Latin rhythm/African drum mashup, and I am a HUGE fan. Very much looking forward to this. Scores: 3,3,3,4 - a total of 13 for James and Luba. Craig thought the pancake tossing was the best bit, his kicks and flicks were like a bucking bull. At least I think he said bucking, it\u2019s hard to know. The dance wasn\u2019t better than last week, but James\u2019 personality definitely was. Motsi agrees, this week James clearly had fun, but he needs to work on the dancing. Shirley thought James really struggled with the content, but with determination he will improve. Bruno thought James wasn\u2019t exactly light on his feet, but he is moving in the right direction and he made the dance his own. So this starts with flipping pancakes, and never really evolves into any kind of Jive. Watching James dance is kind of fascinating. It\u2019s like he\u2019s battling some kind of invisible gravitational force that stops his body and limbs moving at a normal speed. So bad it was kind of amazing, can we keep him in? It\u2019s time for JAMES AND LUBA! Tonight they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018Tutti Frutti\u2019 by Little Richard. I\u2019m hoping for all our sakes that Luba has kept the footwork super-simple; last week showed us that James is not one of life\u2019s natural dancers. He\u2019s definitely in the danger zone this weekend and needs to find some serious kicks and flicks to stay out of the bottom two. In the audience, Ben Fogle! SURELY he\u2019s got to do Strictly at some point, I\u2019m very much here for a Crufts theme. Apparently he can\u2019t even clap in time to the music, which puts him in very good company in that audience. Scores: 6,6,6,6 - a total of 24 for Emma and Anton. Bruno thought Emma has the right feel and potential for ballroom \u2013 she threw everything into it, but it lacked a continuous gliding quality. Craig thought the top line needs improvement and there was occasional gapping, but Emma has real dance talent. Motsi thought Emma was a dancing queen, and she\u2019d like to see more of her quality. Shirley thought it had flashes of brilliance, but a few timing issues here and there. Emma is looking a bit wobbly in this Foxtrot, hasn\u2019t quite mastered her balance. But nice footwork and she\u2019s keeping up with the timing and the endless spins. A bit gappy, but a decent effort for Week 2. Next up it\u2019s EMMA B AND ANTON! Their dance this week is the Foxtrot to \u2018Sunshine of Your Love\u2019 by Ella Fitzgerald, Ernie Heckscher Big Band and Tommy Flanagan. Drink for every time Anton is declared \u2018King Of The Ballroom\u2019, and bonus drink for any evidence presented to support this. KING OF BALLROOM! DRINK! Scores: 5,7,7,7 \u2013 a total of 26 for Chris and Karen. Shirley thought it was extraordinary, and it had great personality. Bruno loved the elements of Lindyhop, which were absolutely delicious \u2013 it was entertaining and charming. Craig thought it could have been crazier and more exaggerated, and Chris only had one facial expression, but that dance has given him hope. Motsi loved the personality, it was very nice. Karen seems to be dressed as Dora The Explorer, no idea why. Chris\u2019s timing is really not bad and the storytelling and slapstick elements are fab, but his feet don\u2019t really do what they\u2019re supposed to and that cartwheel was a shambles. Still, much better than last week, and it was good fun. Who\u2019s next? It\u2019s CHRIS AND KAREN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018Out of Our Heads\u2019 by three fifths of Take That. If you\u2019re not familiar with this song, it was their ill-advised foray into Light Skiffle last year, which I was pretty happy to forget ever happened. THANKS, Strictly. KIDS. DRINK. Scores: 4,6,6,6 - a total of 22 for Emma and Aljaz. Motsi loved the attitude and attack, but Emma needs to keep it up to the last beat. Shirley loved Emma\u2019s frame, but she needs to work on her stamina \u2013 a good improvement from last week. Bruno thought Emma ran out of juice, and she needs to maintain the character. Craig thought it lacked attack and aggression, and the footwork was messy. Don\u2019\u2019t love this music for Tango, but Emma is doing a decent job and giving it some nice attitude. Her top line isn\u2019t quite right, but all quite elegant and good footwork until it all fizzles out a bit at the end. Not the fiercest, but definite progress. Next up it\u2019s EMMA W AND ALJA\u017d! This week they\u2019re dancing the Tango to \u2018Sucker\u2019 by Jonas Brothers. So far all we\u2019ve seen from Emma is sunshine and rainbows, so interesting to see if she can do Dramatic Tango face. Meanwhile we are ALL a sucker for Aljaz. Very much enjoying the commitment to training footage so far. Does this mark the end of the comedy VT? *hopeful face* Scores: 6,7,7,7 - a total of 27 for Dev and Dianne. Craig noticed the turned in toes too, and it was slightly flat-footed, but he loved the energy and personality. Motsi loved the musicality \u2013 Dev kept the time and it was fun to watch. Shirley thought Dev was quite light on his feet, and it was very entertainment despite his feet telling the wrong time. Bruno loved the swagger and style, and Dev \u2018got the pump going\u2019. Despite Dev\u2019s feet being a bit turned in, this Jive has some nice energy and decent timing. Kicks and flicks could have more welly, but plenty of content and nice characterisation. Good fun all round. It\u2019s time for DEV AND DIANNE! Their second dance of the series is the Jive to \u2018Dance With Me Tonight\u2019 by Olly Murs. This is a great song for a Jive, and a good opportunity for Dev\u2019s character to shine through. I\u2019m already a big fan of these two. Scores: 4,5,5,5 - a total of 19 for Anneka and Kevin. Bruno thought it had some very nice moves and Anneka should be proud of herself; however her top line was too tense and she looked a bit panicky. Craig thought it lacked rise and fall, but Kevin has worked miracles. Motsi agrees it was a huge improvement \u2013 simple but simply beautiful. Shirley thought Anneka should pat herself on the back. Anneka looks glorious in pink, that dress is divine. Her top line is a bit stiff and unsteady, and a few timing issues in the footwork, but rather charming and lovely storytelling. Also big hand to the Dave Arch singer tackling Whitney, that was outstanding. Next up (uh oh slot of death) is ANNEKA AND KEVIN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Waltz to \u2018Run to You\u2019 by Whitney Houston. I\u2019m worried that Kevin will see this as an opportunity for interpretive contempo-waft and forget to Waltz. I\u2019m worried about Anneka dancing in a dress and heels after last week\u2019s boiler suit and plimsolls horror show. Mostly I\u2019m just worried. Time for the Terms &amp; Conditions, courtesy of 80s crooner Tony Hadley. Why hasn\u2019t he ever been on Strictly? He\u2019d be gold (GOLD). Talking of gold, Claudia\u2019s dress is truly horrible. Scores: 5,5,6,7 - a total of 23 for Saffron and AJ. Shirley would like Saffron to work on her musicality and the fundamentals, and then the sky\u2019s the limit. Bruno thought the timing went awry but it was a complex routine and Saffron did extremely well. Craig thought it was stiff in the hip but Saffron has the most amazing spins. Motsi loved the speed and Saffron\u2019s energy, and she really delivered \u2013 everyone else now has to do the same. Saffron appears to be dressed in rainbow raffia, and her fake tan has already gone off the Ronseal chart. She\u2019s got some nice precision footwork, but the timing is patchy in this Cha Cha and the transitions needs some work. Definitely an ambitious routine to start the show, not sure what the judges will make of that. Right, let\u2019s get some dancing under way. First up tonight is SAFFRON AND AJ! This week they\u2019re dancing the Cha Cha to \u2018One Touch\u2019 by Jess Glynne and Jax Jones. It\u2019s another chart pop banger for the YouTube kids, but Saffron needs to broaden her appeal if she\u2019s going to win the public vote on a live show. A solid opening Cha Cha is a good place to start. Out come the stars! Mike Bushell appears to have rolled in a pile of leaves coated in sick, which is unfortunate. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a space blanket, Claudia in a crumpled toffee finger wrapper. Is anyone else\u2019s TV cutting out? If it\u2019s just mine, that\u2019s awfully inconvenient. And we\u2019re off! Last week on Strictly: a show that lasted so long I had to start tucking into my Brexit stockpile of Haribo Tangfastics. Lots of great dancing, including a Kelvin/Oti Samba that pretty much made me pregnant. A handful of clunkers this year, but actually a decent number of beginners with huge potential, and fewer shameless ringers than we\u2019ve had in the past. A couple of theatre schoolers, but no-one with significant dance experience that I know of, which is how it should be. BA-BA-BA-BA etc. Anneka making a run for it, Mike Bushell leapfrog, annoying Will/Janette fist bump. Three months of this, people. This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo \u2013 a swig of that dirt rough liqueur at the back of your walk-in larder for any occurrence of the following: Comedy VTs featuring limited training footage Early appearances of kids or nannas Dry ice covering up dodgy footwork Phone hands Hats Evening all, and welcome back to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! It\u2019s Week 2, which means the public vote will be opening tonight and our first couple will be going home tomorrow. Sad as this is, I\u2019m already dreaming of shows that run for less than two hours, so we definitely need to start politely hoofing people off. Last week we saw all our couples dance for the first, time, which means we can start making very broad assumptions about how far they\u2019ll go in this year\u2019s competition. Right now these are based on very little evidence, but we\u2019ll shuffle these around as the weeks pass. Feel free to give this brand new liveblog feature a better name than oh, I don\u2019t know, Heidi\u2019s Hunches. Group 1: driving for December \u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni, Karim and Amy, Dev and Dianne, Saffron and AJ Group 2: battling for Blackpool \u2013 Emma B and Anton, Emma W and Aljaz, Alex and Neil, Catherine and Johannes, Will and Janette Group 3: happy to see Halloween \u2013 Chris and Karen, Mike and Katya Group 4: dodging the dance-off \u2013 David and Nadiya, James and Luba, Anneka and Kevin Kick-off is at 6.40pm; the show is a whole 10 minutes shorter than last week, but still a hefty two hours and nine minutes so bring wit, sparkle and a fully-stocked picnic basket to the comment box below. See you then!",

He became a household name after his family collected a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005, the biggest corporate payout in UK history.</p>\n    <p>But in 2006 Topshop supremo Jane Shepherdson, the woman who put the brand on the fashion A-list, left amid rumours she was unhappy with Green\u2019s management style. Her exit came just as Topshop teamed up with Kate Moss.</p>\n    <p>The Croydon-born model helped front Topshop\u2019s expansion into the US in 2009 where Green pledged to build a billion-dollar business. Three years later US private equity firm Leonard Green bought a 25% stake in Topshop for a reported \u00a3350m.</p>\n    <p>Topshop and Arcadia\u2019s other brands were slow to adapt to online shopping, however, and faced increasing competition from cheaper rivals, including Asos, H&amp;M and Primark. AS sales fell, the group\u2019s pension deficit rose. The collapse of BHS in 2016, shortly after Green had sold it to a serial bankrupt for \u00a31, also dented his reputation.</p>\n    <p>Arcadia recently bought back Leonard Green\u2019s stake in Topshop for virtually nothing. The group warned it could collapse if landlords did not back a rescue plan involving closing 50 stores and rent cuts. The plan was approved after landlords were promised a 20% stake in any sale of the business. The Green family also pledged to pump \u00a3100m into the group\u2019s ailing pension scheme.</p>\n    <p><b>Sarah Butler</b></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Arcadia has said Miss Selfridge will mainly sell online in future \u2013 and the dire sales figures indicate why the chain faced tougher cuts than some of the group\u2019s other brands.</p> \n<p>In May, the company said it planned to put the property holding companies of Miss Selfridge and its sister brand Evans into administration, resulting in the closure of 25 stores. But this action has yet to happen.</p> \n<p>Arcadia is battling for survival after it admitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/06/philip-greens-retail-empire-faces-uncertain-future-without-new-funds\">there was \u201cmaterial uncertainty</a>\u201d about its ability to continue trading without new funds, after slumping to a \u00a3177.3m loss last year \u2013 including Miss Selfridge\u2019s poor performance.</p> \n<p>The group\u2019s flagship Topshop and Topman chains, which have about 350 stores worldwide, slumped to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/12/philip-green-topshop-and-topman-report-505m-loss\">a \u00a3</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/12/philip-green-topshop-and-topman-report-505m-loss\">505m</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/12/philip-green-topshop-and-topman-report-505m-loss\"> loss</a>, as sales fell 9% to \u00a3846.8m in the year to 1 September.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8113512b-8ee0-49dc-80d3-0b56df87e441\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What\u2019s the problem?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Physical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, unseasonably warm weather, rising costs and broader economic problems. In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers.

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green\u2019s Miss Selfridge chain posted a \u00a317.5m loss last year as sales fell and it wrote down the value of loss-making stores. Sales at the youth fashion chain fell more than 15% to \u00a3102m in the year to 1 September 2018, while pretax losses more than quadrupled from \u00a34.3m a year before. Losses widened after more than \u00a312m in one-off costs mostly related to property writedowns were added, as well as redundancies. The average number of staff working in the chain\u2019s UK stores fell by about 300 to 1,188. Miss Selfridge has since faced further job cuts and has closed its Oxford Street flagship as part of a rescue restructure of Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, which also owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton. Arcadia has said Miss Selfridge will mainly sell online in future \u2013 and the dire sales figures indicate why the chain faced tougher cuts than some of the group\u2019s other brands. In May, the company said it planned to put the property holding companies of Miss Selfridge and its sister brand Evans into administration, resulting in the closure of 25 stores. But this action has yet to happen. Arcadia is battling for survival after it admitted there was \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d about its ability to continue trading without new funds, after slumping to a \u00a3177.3m loss last year \u2013 including Miss Selfridge\u2019s poor performance. The group\u2019s flagship Topshop and Topman chains, which have about 350 stores worldwide, slumped to a \u00a3505m loss, as sales fell 9% to \u00a3846.8m in the year to 1 September. Taveta Investments, the owner of Arcadia, said difficulties refinancing a \u00a3310m loan on Topshop\u2019s Oxford Street store, due to expire in December, could mean it would have to raise new funds to survive. Green\u2019s retail empire, which is formally owned by his Monaco-based wife, Tina Green, staved off collapse in June after winning backing from creditors for a rescue plan that involved the closure of about 50 stores, 1,000 redundancies and rent cuts of up to 50%. The group\u2019s ailing brands have struggled to compete with rivals such as Asos, H&amp;M and Primark after years of underinvestment.",

But often the biggest selling point isn\u2019t the amenities, it\u2019s the location. Sparkling bays, islands ringed with white sand and valleys teeming with native wildlife are the grand promise. While their day spas and five-star restaurants might be exclusive, the landscapes these sites occupy aren\u2019t necessarily inaccessible. Hiding down the track or across the sea are far more affordable places to stay, with that same magical feeling. We asked travel writers across the country to select visited-and-vetted, affordable \u201cdupes\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s bargain-hunter code for \u201cduplicates\u201d \u2013 of some of Australia\u2019s most elite destination resorts. 1.

As long as you are legally allowed to work in Australia, you should receive equal support.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2012, the Australian government established the <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/industrial-relations/fair-entitlements-guarantee/Pages/default.aspx\">Fair Entitlement Guarantee</a> (FEG), which protects the employees of companies which go bankrupt. Australian citizens and permanent residents are entitled to up to 13 weeks of unpaid wages, as well as any unpaid annual leave and redundancy pay.</p> <p>But migrant workers such as Cong receive nothing. More than 900,000 temporary migrants in Australia with work rights are excluded from the FEG, despite repeated calls that they are among the most vulnerable workers in Australia, at significant risk of exploitation by companies going into liquidation, and should be protected.</p> <p>Matt Kunkel, the director of the Migrant Workers Centre, told the Guardian some companies that employed large numbers of migrants were deliberately using liquidation as a tactic to avoid paying entitlements, or forcing workers into accepting smaller settlements. He said measures to counter phoenix companies \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/General/The-fight-against-tax-crime/Our-focus/Illegal-phoenix-activity/\">companies </a><a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/General/The-fight-against-tax-crime/Our-focus/Illegal-phoenix-activity/\">created \u201cfrom the ashes\u201d of another</a>, taking over the business of a company that has been deliberately liquidated to avoid paying its debts \u2013 were not working.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no accountability for employers who can shut up shop and open up again the following day with a new name, wiping away tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of worker entitlements. When caught underpaying staff, some employers have expressly threatened to go into liquidation as a tactic to force workers to accept a smaller settlement. This move is only available to employers because temporary migrant workers have no access to the FEG scheme to recover their unpaid entitlements.\u201d</p> <p>In March this year, the Migrant Workers Taskforce headed by former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission boss Alan Fels recommended the FEG be extended to cover migrant workers, or an equivalent scheme established to protect them. The taskforce found it was \u201cinequitable for migrant workers \u2026 to be treated differently to Australian citizens\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs taxpayers, they contribute to the cost of the Fair Entitlement Guarantee.\u201d</p> <p>The taskforce heard extending the FEG to migrant workers would cost about $20m, but that \u201cthese costs would be reduced, however, the more successful the government is in dealing with phoenix traders\u201d.</p> <p>The government accepted \u201cin principle\u201d to all 22 recommendations from the taskforce, saying \u201cthese workers have been doing the right thing by satisfying their taxation obligations, the government considers it reasonable that they, in turn, be protected by the FEG program\u201d.</p> <p>However, six months on the government has not yet begun consultation on the issue.</p> <p>A spokesman for the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, told the Guardian: \u201cIn response to the Migrant Worker Taskforce, the government agreed to examine the extension of the FEG to migrant workers with work rights.</p> <p>\u201cDetails of timing and the mechanism for consultation on this proposal will be outlined in due course.\u201d</p> <p>Kunkel told the Guardian the Migrant Workers Centre had seen dozens of cases of migrant workers left with nothing by a liquidated company.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not unusual for individual claims to mount into the tens of thousands of dollars if they have a long period of service.\u201d</p> <p>Migrant workers, often vulnerable already, face the threat of homelessness, relying on charity to feed their families, or being driven into the black economy to survive, Kunkel told the Guardian. The Migrant Workers Centre has seen liquidations across industries, but particularly in those where the rates of migrant employees are high, such as hospitality, construction, labour hire, meat processing and waste recycling.</p> <p>Adjunct fellow at Swinburne University\u2019s Centre for Urban Transitions, Peter Mares, said the continued exclusion of temporary migrant workers from the FEG was \u201cunconscionable\u201d. He estimates more than 900,000 migrant workers in Australia are potentially excluded from the FEG.</p> <p>\u201cThe principle of the FEG is that a worker, who, through no fault of their own, loses out on an entitlement when a company goes bust, should be protected. There is no reason why a temporary migrant worker should be treated differently to a citizen or permanent resident.

      "bodyText": "Oppressed for his religious beliefs and driven from his job, Fu Cong fled China for safety and a new life in Australia, seeking, in his words, \u201cfairness and justice\u201d. He found, instead, a prolonged but perfectly legal exploitation. Having joined the banned Falung Gong spiritual group persecuted as \u201canti-government\u201d by the Chinese Communist party, Cong lost his job as a teacher after nearly two decades of service. He made the \u201cagonising\u201d decision to leave his home town in north-east China for a land, he had read, was fair and egalitarian. \u201cMoving to a foreign place on my own and at my age is extremely difficult. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times my wife and I cried over the decision. It was incredibly painful. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I was completely out of options in China I wouldn\u2019t have taken such a huge risk.\u201d Cong arrived in Australia by plane and lodged a protection claim as a refugee. While his claim was assessed by the Australian government, Cong was granted a bridging visa with work rights, and after initial difficulty finding employment, he found a job in a printing company in suburban Melbourne. The work was difficult and the hours long, but it was steady employment, and slowly Cong built a life and a community in Australia. However, unbeknown to its employees, the printing company was trading while insolvent and declared bankruptcy without warning in October last year. Cong was left with nothing more than a string of dishonoured paycheques. He is owed about $5,000 in unpaid wages and redundancy entitlements. \u201cI was on an overnight shift the day we found out the factory went bankrupt and we all still went to work unaware of the situation. It was only when one of my co-workers called our boss, we were told that we no longer had jobs,\u201d Cong told the Guardian. \u201cBefore this, I had several salary cheques that were dishonoured by the bank and had no idea why. I was completely shocked, it was an awful time.\u201d In 2012, the Australian government established the Fair Entitlement Guarantee (FEG), which protects the employees of companies which go bankrupt. Australian citizens and permanent residents are entitled to up to 13 weeks of unpaid wages, as well as any unpaid annual leave and redundancy pay. But migrant workers such as Cong receive nothing. More than 900,000 temporary migrants in Australia with work rights are excluded from the FEG, despite repeated calls that they are among the most vulnerable workers in Australia, at significant risk of exploitation by companies going into liquidation, and should be protected. Matt Kunkel, the director of the Migrant Workers Centre, told the Guardian some companies that employed large numbers of migrants were deliberately using liquidation as a tactic to avoid paying entitlements, or forcing workers into accepting smaller settlements. He said measures to counter phoenix companies \u2013 companies created \u201cfrom the ashes\u201d of another, taking over the business of a company that has been deliberately liquidated to avoid paying its debts \u2013 were not working. \u201cThere is no accountability for employers who can shut up shop and open up again the following day with a new name, wiping away tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of worker entitlements. When caught underpaying staff, some employers have expressly threatened to go into liquidation as a tactic to force workers to accept a smaller settlement. This move is only available to employers because temporary migrant workers have no access to the FEG scheme to recover their unpaid entitlements.\u201d In March this year, the Migrant Workers Taskforce headed by former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission boss Alan Fels recommended the FEG be extended to cover migrant workers, or an equivalent scheme established to protect them. The taskforce found it was \u201cinequitable for migrant workers \u2026 to be treated differently to Australian citizens\u201d. \u201cAs taxpayers, they contribute to the cost of the Fair Entitlement Guarantee.\u201d The taskforce heard extending the FEG to migrant workers would cost about $20m, but that \u201cthese costs would be reduced, however, the more successful the government is in dealing with phoenix traders\u201d. The government accepted \u201cin principle\u201d to all 22 recommendations from the taskforce, saying \u201cthese workers have been doing the right thing by satisfying their taxation obligations, the government considers it reasonable that they, in turn, be protected by the FEG program\u201d. However, six months on the government has not yet begun consultation on the issue. A spokesman for the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, told the Guardian: \u201cIn response to the Migrant Worker Taskforce, the government agreed to examine the extension of the FEG to migrant workers with work rights. \u201cDetails of timing and the mechanism for consultation on this proposal will be outlined in due course.\u201d Kunkel told the Guardian the Migrant Workers Centre had seen dozens of cases of migrant workers left with nothing by a liquidated company. \u201cIt is not unusual for individual claims to mount into the tens of thousands of dollars if they have a long period of service.\u201d Migrant workers, often vulnerable already, face the threat of homelessness, relying on charity to feed their families, or being driven into the black economy to survive, Kunkel told the Guardian. The Migrant Workers Centre has seen liquidations across industries, but particularly in those where the rates of migrant employees are high, such as hospitality, construction, labour hire, meat processing and waste recycling. Adjunct fellow at Swinburne University\u2019s Centre for Urban Transitions, Peter Mares, said the continued exclusion of temporary migrant workers from the FEG was \u201cunconscionable\u201d. He estimates more than 900,000 migrant workers in Australia are potentially excluded from the FEG. \u201cThe principle of the FEG is that a worker, who, through no fault of their own, loses out on an entitlement when a company goes bust, should be protected. There is no reason why a temporary migrant worker should be treated differently to a citizen or permanent resident. They have suffered the same loss.\u201d Mares, the author of Not Quite Australian which examines temporary migration in Australia, said the cost to government of expanding the FEG to migrant workers was marginal, and that he could see \u201cno impediment\u201d to what would be a simple legislative reform. \u201cThis is an example of what happens when you\u2019re not represented, when you don\u2019t have a political voice. Migrant workers are less likely to be represented by a trade union, at an even more basic democratic level you\u2019re simply not represented, you don\u2019t have a vote, you don\u2019t have a local member. Your interests are going to count less.\u201d Heloise Williams, an employment lawyer for not-for-profit legal centre JobWatch handling Cong\u2019s case, said his treatment was reflective of a broader legislative discrimination against migrant workers, who were acutely vulnerable \u2013 particularly if they faced language barriers, were unaware of their workplace rights, or if their visa was tied to a specific employer. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some awful things play out because the employer knows they have the power in those relationships and because the workers themselves aren\u2019t aware of their rights under Australian law.They will often get underpaid and be asked to work incredibly long hours.\u201d Cong says he has despaired at how he has been treated. \u201cI came to your country to seek refuge, I\u2019ve been exploited and received no support from the government, is this the democracy and just treatment of those in need that Australia talks about?\u201d He said he realises his hopes of ever being paid are slim, but he hoped the laws would be changed so that other migrants would not be similarly exploited. \u201cAs long as you are legally allowed to work in Australia, you should receive equal support.\u201d",

For Australia perhaps the tipping point is already passed. After this year\u2019s election we remain saddled for three years with a federal government laden with climate-change deniers and charlatans who may or may not accept the science, but who sure as heck accept the political opportunity from scaring people about pursing action. This is what the ALP is currently wrestling with. Yes, at a minimum we need to reduce emissions by 45% below 2005 levels, but to do that in eight years will require a much more severe effort than it would have had the ALP been able to enact policies now. So you can see some political reasoning for the ALP to think it is better to focus on reducing emissions to net zero by 2050 rather than the 45% cut by 2030. Because, as was made clear again this year, the LNP is more than willing to smash the fear button during an election. It is why the prime minister\u2019s committed the most contemptible kind of hypocrisy when he suggested in his speech at the UN this week that \u201cwe must respect and harness the passion and aspiration of our younger generations, we must guard against others who would seek to compound or, worse, facelessly exploit their anxiety for their own agendas\u201d. Someone should introduce Scott Morrison to the disingenuous fear monger who during the election campaign went around the country telling everyone that \u201cBill Shorten wants to end the weekend\u201d. If this year\u2019s election has shown us anything there is no advantage at all from being the only major party with an emissions policy that supports the science. We spent six weeks with far too many journalists losing their minds trying to discover a middle ground between logic and lies, and so ended up arguing the big issue on climate change was the cost of the ALP\u2019s policy on the economy, rather than the manifestly inadequate cuts being proposed by the LNP. And that brings us to the second tipping point. Scott Morrison\u2019s meeting Donald Trump truly was the apprentice genuflecting to the master. Morrison has demonstrated a Trumpesque ability to fudge, mislead and obfuscate, and to also suggest things are the opposite of reality. With Trump there is no ulterior motive \u2013 his total lack of introspection combined with total ignorance leads him to lie and believe his own reality; for Morrison however the application is much more tactical. So we saw him telling journalists that the argument on climate change has been \u201csettled in Australian politics\u201d \u2013 that there is agreement on the action: \u201cThe action that meets, that we meet our 2020 targets and we meet our 2030 targets. And that we have a $3 billion climate solutions fund, a policy for meeting our 2030 emissions reduction targets.\u201d What bullshit. Those targets themselves are pathetic \u2013 a climate-change pea and thimble trick involving dodgy accounting of land-use and carry-over credits. Even with this the targets are well below what is argued as needed by scientists. If we excluded land use our emissions would have risen 7% above 2005 levels, rather than fallen by 11%. Our government is so useless, they are essentially cheating in order to underperform. As for that $3bn climate solutions fund: does any sentient being truly believe $3bn over 10 years is enough to adequately reduce emissions? The government brings in $505bn a year in revenue, so spending less than half a percent of that each year over 10 years will do the trick? If that were so then we would not be worrying about climate change \u2013 every nation in the world would have signed that pitifully small cheque and gone on their merry way. And so we are at a tipping point. The prime minister of this country is now suggesting the media are lying about the government\u2019s climate change efforts. He told reporters in New York last week, \u201cSee what I\u2019ve found in engaging with neighbours, and even here, is often times the criticisms that have been made about Australia are completely false and they\u2019re completely misleading and people have had a prejudiced view about what Australia is actually doing.

The transformation into Ocker Trump (\u201cWho knows? Maybe they read it, maybe they read it\u201d) is now so obvious that no journalist or media company can miss it. The tipping point is here. After looking across the Pacific and raising eyebrows at how the US media has covered Trump, now Australian journalists have our chance to demonstrate how they would do it. The tipping point is here.

At the start of the season, Leicester were an outside bet to break into the top six. Now they look a useful bet to break into the top three. Since Brendan Rodgers took over, they have probably been the best team in the Premier League outside the Really Big Two, and a win at home to Newcastle today would move them to third in this season\u2019s table.</p> <p>The likeliest scenario is a comfortable Leicester win, although they are without the injured James Maddison. And Newcastle can be a contrary bunch; their only win so far this season was away at Spurs, and they have won on their last two visits to the King Power Stadium. But their ambitions are more modest than Leicester\u2019s. Never mind the top three; they\u2019ll be happy to finish outside the bottom three.</p> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> is at 4.30pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T14:58:12.355Z\">at 3.58pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave you with Paul Doyle\u2019s match report on another very happy day for all connected with Leicester City. Night! The Newcastle captain Jamaal Lascelles speaks \u201cTerrible. We\u2019ve nobody to blame except ourselves. It\u2019s just not acceptable. We really do need to look ourselves in the mirror. We\u2019ve never considered five goals since I\u2019ve been at the club. I dunno\u2026 The boys do care, and being a man down is a disadvantage, but you can still roll your sleeves up and get into a shape where they don\u2019t score anymore. We didn\u2019t do that. It ain\u2019t good enough. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what manager you have, you need to have a bit of pride yourself and make sure you win your flipping duels: don\u2019t let one-twos, stay with the runner, the little simple things. We didn\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to say we gave up, but we really need to sit down and look back at that because it\u2019s not acceptable. But we can\u2019t let it affect us going forward.\u201d Post-match reaction Jamie Vardy \u201cWe thought the first goal would be all-important, and in the end we got a good win. We\u2019ve got lots of different ways we can score. We used to be a counter-attacking side but now we\u2019ve got different dimensions to our attack, and you saw that with our goals today.\u201d Ricardo Pereira \u201cI saw the space [for the goal]. Jamie\u2019s movement dragged one of the defenders away, and then I tried my luck and I scored. It\u2019s nice to keep a clean sheet as well, that\u2019s my first job.\u201d That was a mismatch even before Isaac Hayden was sent off for a horrible tackle on Dennis Praet just before half-time. Leicester are an excellent side - so much fun to watch and, it seems, to play in. Elite football isn\u2019t supposed to be enjoyable but Leicester\u2019s players look like they\u2019re having a whale of a time. Their next game is at Anfield next Saturday, and there\u2019s already water in my mouth. Peep peep! Leicester thump 10-man Newcastle to move up to third in the table. It\u2019s their biggest win in the Premier League era. 90+2 min \u201cI fear you\u2019re being too optimistic,\u201d says Scott Bassett. \u201cShelvey is erratic, Yedlin functional, Leujeune, to be fair is very good. But keeping Carroll fit is far from given, Joelinton, Willems and Saint-Maximin are unproven and, worst of all, Bruce seems to be a complete mediocrity. It was the tactical knowhow of Rafa that made a decent team from an average-ish bunch of players. Bruce has none of that, as best I can tell.\u201d I quite like a front four of Saint-Maximin, Almiron and Ritchie behind Joelinton. My gut feeling is that they\u2019ll stay up, though they need to start winning at home very quickly. Wilfred Ndidi gets one for the road, beating Dubravka with a smart shot on the turn from 12 yards. Leicester are going to the top of the Premier League\u2019s Second Division in some style. 88 min Schar is booked for something or other. Something, I think. 87 min \u201cIt\u2019s funny how you can just take to certain players for almost no reason,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI know little about Almiron, I have no real ties to Newcastle, but I really like him. I enjoy watching him, and it\u2019s disappointing how things still haven\u2019t quite come together for him. He\u2019s got so many good qualities, and in all honesty, I\u2019m not even completely sure exactly how Newcastle fans feel about him, but I hope he sticks around the league for a good while.\u201d Admirable sentiments which you\u2019ll doubtless repeat when he roofs one from 30 yards to deny Liverpool the title on the final day of the season. 84 min Imagine how messy this might have been for Newcastle had James Maddison been fit. 83 min Another Leicester change - Demarai Gray replaces Ayoze Perez. 82 min Leicester put together a move of at least 20 passes, and then Ricardo ruins it all by being offside. 79 min A Leicester change: Hamza Choudhury, whose Hayden-esque tackle on Matt Ritchie caused such controversy when these sides met in the Carabao Cup, replaces Dennis Praet. 74 min Tielemans\u2019 stinging shot from 20 yards hits Longstaff and goes behind for a corner. Nothing comes of it. 73 min Another Newcastle change: DeAndre Yedlin replaces the sadly anonymous Miguel Almiron. 71 min The Newcastle fans are still making most of the noise. They\u2019re a hardy bunch all right. 68 min \u201cThe Hayden red card unfortunately hands Bruce a ready-made excuse for this Newcastle disaster, who have looked awful since maybe the 10th minute,\u201d says Scott Bassett. \u201cThe loss of Rondon and Perez were major, but obviously the most consequential loss for this team was Benitez. Is it too early to say Newcastle are doomed?\u201d Yes, but it\u2019s not too early to say they\u2019re in bother. They are missing some very good players through injury, though. A team with Ritchie, Shelvey, Yedlin, Lejeune, Willems and a match-fit Carroll and Saint-Maximin would be so much stronger. It\u2019s grim and grimmer for Newcastle. The substitute Albrighton floats a delicious cross from the left towards Vardy, who gets behind Dummett and heads past Dubravka from close range. 64 min \u201cVardy seems to be dangerous again,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cI really thought he would not buy into Brendan\u2019s way of doing things. It is quite impressive seeing the team go from one with a penchant for downing tools when their Perrier water is not the right temperature to style trailblazers.\u201d 63 min A Newcastle change: Joelinton off, Andy Carroll on. 61 min \u201cRob,\u201d says Ron Harris. \u201cSurely the reason why there are far fewer broken legs these days is because of the carpet slippers that players wear compared to the much more rigid footwear of yesteryear.\u201d Ah, I meant the opposite \u2013 why were so few legs broken back in the day, given the number of eye-watering challenges. 60 min Vardy misses his kick, 12 yards from goal. Leicester have the full swagger on now. 59 min I\u2019d like to see a replay of the second goal. The only one we have seen, from a dodgy angle, suggested Barnes probably had a nasal hair offside in the build-up. But presumably the proper replays were shown to the VAR people. 58 min A Leicester change. Marc Albrighton replaces Harvey Barnes. This is getting grisly for Newcastle. Ricardo finds Praet, whose cross deflects off the stretching Dummett and beats the wrongfooted Dubravka at the near post. GOAL GIVEN! I thought there was an offside in the build-up, but apparently not. It was a nicely worked goal. Praet\u2019s long, angled pass from centre to left found Barnes, who cushioned the bouncing ball into the area for Vardy. He was too quick for Schar and drove a low shot from a tight angle that beat Dubravka at the near post. That\u2019s a goalkeeping error. VAR check Hang on, I think this is offside. Goodnight. 52 min \u201cI predicted Leicester would finish top four before the season started, so feeling faintly smug,\u201d says Norrie Hernon. \u201cYou could argue that the Prem has never been poorer, given the giant gap between top two and everyone else. Or you could argue that the ridiculous wealth in the league has actually resulted in a levelling of sorts, so there\u2019s not much between 3rd and 8th. But it\u2019s all good fun. City don\u2019t seem to be quite as good as before. Liverpool pulling off April wins in September. Ah, don\u2019t you just love it?\u201d Yep, watching City and Liverpool become probably the best two teams in the world is the stuff dreams are made of. 50 min Leicester\u2019s next match is ... away to Liverpool, next Saturday at 3pm. That, for mine, is the most intriguing fixture of the season so far. I don\u2019t know whether to be irritated or happy that it won\u2019t be televised. 49 min Leicester have picked up where they left off, moving the ball from side to side in an attempt to open up the Newcastle defence. A second goal shouldn\u2019t be too far away. 46 min Peep peep! Newcastle begin the second half. \u201cGood afternoon Rob,\u201d says John Davis. \u201cOn first sight, I thought that was reckless but not too bad - a dark yellow (yes, I am a Newcastle fan). Having seen it back, that\u2019s exactly why the law has been changed over the years. It was out of control and could have broken his leg easily. I understand Hayden protesting he had to go for it and what else was he to do, but even if you win the ball you can\u2019t endanger someone like that. \u201cI know - crowbar - Souness was playing in a different era, but he\u2019d barely have finished a match. Just like in rugby, you have to be able to be physical but you shouldn\u2019t be able to put your opponent at such a high degree of physical risk. You need to be better and not be put in that position in the first place.\u201d Indeed. I watch a lot of old games, for work and for the purest pleasure. Many of the tackles are brutal and/or guiltily hilarious. Even this, for example, might be a red card for either player or both in 2019. One thing I don\u2019t understand is why more players didn\u2019t suffer broken legs. The game isn\u2019t that much faster these days. Some half-time reading Peep peep! Leicester are a goal up, a man up, and 45 minutes away from moving up to third in the table. Ricardo Pereira\u2019s majestic solo goal was the least they deserved for a performance full of style and swagger. Newcastle were hanging on even before Isaac Hayden was sent off for a 20th-century tackle on Dennis Praet. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45+3 min After another neat move down the left by Leicester, Barnes hits a sizzling drive from 18 yards that just clears the crossbar. 45 min The more you see that tackle, the worse it gets. Praet\u2019s leg almost gave way, and he is limping heavily. Newcastle have made a necessary tactical change, meanwhile, with Ki Sung-yeung replacing Muto. 44 min Hayden got the ball first but his follow through took him into Praet, studs first at shin height. He\u2019s not happy, saying \u2018What\u2019s the point in playing?\u2019 to the fourth official as he leaves the field, but it looked a clear red card. 43 min Newcastle are down to 10 men. Hayden ploughed through Praet, a horrible challenge that could easily have broken his leg, and Craig Pawson gives him a straight red. 42 min Tielemans\u2019 inswinging cross from the left is headed over at the near post by Vardy. He needed a gentler touch, though it was only really a half chance. 41 min Nothing much to report in the last few minutes. It\u2019s hosing down at the King Power Stadium, as it has throughout the match. 36 min The biggest danger for Leicester is complacency. They are in total control of the game. 35 min \u201cRob,\u201d says Redmond Grimes. \u201cI think you will find that Schar was shooting.\u201d Either way, it was a hot hot mess. 34 min Atsu runs at Pereira, beating him on the outside before thrashing a shot over the bar from the left side of the box. 31 min Schar leads a Newcastle counter-attack, reaching the halfway line before trying to pick out Muto with a driven pass from the right wing. Goalkick to Leicester. Dear lord. 29 min Barnes\u2019 cross is punched away by the flying Dubravka. It goes only as far as Praet, whose fierce shot from 15 yards is blocked by a defender on the six-yard line. Leicester are much the better team. 27 min \u201cRob, I agree with you about the Foxes chances,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cBefore Rodgers\u2019 arrival Leicester were limited to a counter-attacking strategy. Rodgers has introduced a more well-rounded offensive attack while keeping their defensive rigour.\u201d I know he is occasionally ludicrous, but I think Rodgers is a superb manager. He\u2019s also world-class at choosing which jobs to take, which sounds obvious but often isn\u2019t the case. It\u2019ll be fascinating to see how he does if he ever inherits a top side. 25 min I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever met a better judge of a footballer than my colleague Paul Doyle. This week, in an email exchange about the joys of James Maddison, he added, \u201cRicardo Pereira = diamond.\u201d Doyle knows. 24 min Vardy is booked for a late tackle on Schar. 18 min That could have been 2-0. Tielemans\u2019 exquisite little pass down the inside-left channel releases Chilwell, whose shot is excellently saved by the outrushing Dubravka. The ball comes back to Chilwell, whose follow-up is blocked desperately by Lascelles on the line. That really was fantastic. Ricardo received the ball just inside his own half, played a one-two with Ayoze Perez and surged into space. Once he got within range he shifted the ball onto his left foot, away from Schar, and cracked a beautiful daisy cutter from 20 yards that swerved just inside the far post. Brilliant. What a wonderful goal from Ricardo Pereira! 16 min \u201cRob, as much as I dislike The Brodge, Leicester are definitely more fun to watch again since he took over,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cBut predictions of top three may be premature. The only \u2018good\u2019 team they have beaten so far this season is Spurs. And well, \u2018lads, it\u2019s Spurs\u2019.\u201d Oh, I don\u2019t think they will finish third, just that they could. And since Rodgers took over they have won more points than any team other than City and Liverpool. They\u2019re a terrific side. And lovely to watch too. 15 min Ayoze Perez lofts a cross beyond the far post to Tielemans, whose sweetly struck left-foot volley deflects off Krafth and flashes into the side netting. The referee, presumably unsighted, gives a goalkick. 12 min Muto misses a good chance for Newcastle. Hayden\u2019s mishit shot from 25 yards fell to him 10 yards from goal, but he was unable to sort his feet out and missed the ball completely. I thought he might have been offside but replays showed he was fine. 8 min Leicester are having loads of possession, as you\u2019d expect. They are a very confident, watchable side. 6 min It\u2019s been an open start to the game. Newcastle\u2019s revamped team look quite bright going forward. 3 min Barnes\u2019s cross was just slightly behind Perez, which is why he ended up shooting a bit too close to Dubravka. 2 min Dubravka makes a smart save from Ayoze Perez. Barnes played a one-two with Tielemans on the left, surged into the area and crossed low towards the near post. Perez got in front of Dummett to shoot from eight yards, but Dubravka got down quickly to his left to save. 1 min Peep peep! Leicester get the match under way, kicking from right to left. The players are ready for business. It\u2019s a dank afternoon in the East Midlands, and both of the managers have gone for a bit of cagoule chic. \u201cBob,\u201d chirps Mac Millings. It\u2019s a controversial position, I know, but I hate VAR. To register my displeasure here\u2019s my all-time VAR XI, or, as I like to call them, VARcelona: Edwin van der VAR Hawkeyle Walker Harry Maguire we using this?

Pre-match reading Dennis Praet replaces James Maddison, who is out with an ankle injury, in the Leicester side. Another promising midfielder, Sean Longstaff, returns to the Newcastle team after a month out. Leicester City (4-1-4-1) Schmeichel; Ricardo, Evans, Soyuncu, Chilwell; Ndidi; Perez, Tielemans, Praet, Barnes; Vardy. Substitutes: Ward, Justin, Morgan, Gray, Albrighton, Choudhury, Iheanacho. Newcastle United (4-2-3-1) Dubravka; Krafth, Schar, Lascelles, Dummett; Longstaff, Hayden; Almiron, Muto, Atsu; Joelinton. Substitutes: Darlow, Fernandez, Manquillo, Yedlin, Ki, Carroll, Saint-Maximin. Referee Craig Pawson. Hello. At the start of the season, Leicester were an outside bet to break into the top six. Now they look a useful bet to break into the top three. Since Brendan Rodgers took over, they have probably been the best team in the Premier League outside the Really Big Two, and a win at home to Newcastle today would move them to third in this season\u2019s table. The likeliest scenario is a comfortable Leicester win, although they are without the injured James Maddison. And Newcastle can be a contrary bunch; their only win so far this season was away at Spurs, and they have won on their last two visits to the King Power Stadium. But their ambitions are more modest than Leicester\u2019s. Never mind the top three; they\u2019ll be happy to finish outside the bottom three. Kick off is at 4.30pm.",

Next week they go to Anfield for a match that will arguably be the biggest test either of those sides has faced this season. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it because I haven\u2019t been back since I left,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a tough game, of course, but we\u2019ll look to embrace that challenge.\u201d",

Only this decade the Conservative party has formed a coalition with one other party, and a confidence and supply agreement with another. (In the past it has formed electoral pacts too - for example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_Coupon\">in 1918.</a>)</p> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected the suggestion that the claim he has announced plans to build 40 new hospitals is misleading. </strong>Asked about this, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a long-term infrastructure plan for 40 hospitals. There is going to be seed funding for all 40. Six are going to start immediately ... that is all going ahead and I\u2019m incredibly proud of that - but there are then 34 more that are coming down the track.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that Labour\u2019s plan to cut working hours announced last week would harm the poor.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They\u2019ve decided that they want a four-day [working] week which would hit the poorest.</p> </blockquote> <p>Labour said last week it would try to bring the average number of hours worked per week down to 32 over a decade, without workers losing pay. Interestingly, there is some evidence that the public do not accept this claim and will believe what Johnson is saying about the plan. This is from a report<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stoke-focus-group-offers-hint-that-boris-johnsons-brexit-strategy-is-working-6sx652qgg\"> in the Times (paywall)</a> on Saturday which wrote up the findings of a focus group in Stoke featuring people who all voted Labour in 2015. It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tony, who works at B&amp;Q, was concerned the plan to cut the working week could put jobs at risk because it would increase costs to business. Sarah said that if she worked fewer hours she would get less pay, which she couldn\u2019t afford.</p> <p>No one thought the plan was a good idea but most thought it had been proposed simply to win their votes. \u201cIt\u2019s unworkable,\u201d said one. \u201cIt\u2019s just idealistic nonsense, isn\u2019t it?

She was also allowed to join two mayoral trade missions despite initially being told her firm did not qualify. Andrew Marr put it to Johnson that he was bound at mayor by a code of conduct saying he was not meant to take decisions to gain benefits for family or friends. Asked if he had declared his friendship with Arcuri, Johnson at first just said he was \u201cvery proud\u201d of everything that he did as mayor and that \u201ceverything was done in accordance with the code ... and everything was done with full propriety\u201d. Asked why he did not declare this interest, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was no interest to declare.</p> </blockquote> <p>This could be significant because it puts pressure on Johnson to explain the full nature of his full relationship with Arcuri.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson claimed that the Arcuri allegations about him were politically motivated and driven by critics opposed to Brexit.</strong> Marr asked if Johnson was embarrassed by the story, saying Johnson did not look embarrassed. Johnson replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I tell you what I really think is going on. I really think that people can feel this country is approaching an important moment of choice, and we have to get on and we have to deliver Brexit, and I think that there is a large constituency, in parliament and elsewhere, who do want to frustrate that objective. And, rightly or wrongly, they see me as the person most likely to deliver that objective. And I\u2019m going to get on and do it.</p> </blockquote> <p>When Marr asked Johnson if he was saying this attack was politically motivated, Johnson replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think you\u2019ve got to be realistic if you\u2019re in my position. You\u2019ve got to expect a lot of shot and shell.</p> </blockquote> <p>Johnson made this claim even though the original Arcuri story was broken by the Sunday Times, which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum and which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, whose flagship tabloid paper, the Sun, is now one of the most fervent newspaper supporters of Johnson and his Brexit strategy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f87068e9e2a01de14b6ac44f5d67005b3989b61e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f87068e9e2a01de14b6ac44f5d67005b3989b61e/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson,with Jennifer Arcuri at the Innotech Summit in July 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson,with Jennifer Arcuri at the Innotech Summit in July 2013</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Innotech Network/YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9074de8f08fbb0c171d7ad\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T09:19:18.754Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson rejects claim his language incites violence, saying he has been 'model of restraint'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a summary of what <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> said about his use of language in the interview.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Boris Johnson rejected claims that the language he was using against his Brexit opponents would incite violence. </strong>He was asked if he accepted what <strong>Amber Rudd</strong>, the former work and pensions secretary, said i<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/amber-rudd-the-boris-johnson-s-casual-approach-to-the-safety-of-mps-is-immoral-a4248456.html\">n an interview with the Evening Standard last week.</a> <strong>Andrew Marr</strong> quoted Rudd as saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The sort of language I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve seen more and more of coming out from Number 10 does incite violence ...

One of the interesting questions to be explored this week is whether that is compatible with also being a party hell-bent on delivering Brexit, possibly the hardest version available.</p> <p>But a more pressing question, of course, is how the prime minister expects to deliver Brexit when no deal with the EU has emerged, he has lost his majority in parliament and MPs have legislated to try to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.</p> <p>This morning\u2019s papers, which are full of interviews and briefings to mark the opening today\u2019s Conservative party conference in Manchester, shed very little light on what Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy might be. But they are illuminating about his election strategy, which as we know involves depicting himself as the champion of the people, trying to deliver Brexit in the face of opposition from parliament. And one headline pushes this proposition almost to the point of absurdity.</p> <p>Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Boris Johnson has suggested that the EU was involved in helping his Brexit critics draw up the Benn Act, the legislation designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.</strong> He raised the idea discreetly in an interview with <strong>Edward Malnick</strong> <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/28/boris-johnson-interview-surrender-act-like-abject-capitulation/?li_source=LI&amp;li_medium=li-recommendation-widget\">in the Sunday Telegraph (paywall)</a>, saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the case of the surrender act, we don\u2019t know whether or not for instance, the European Union has been consulted on on the surrender act, or European Commission lawyers.</p> </blockquote> <p>But a turbo-charged version of the same allegation has made the Mail on Sunday splash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MoS_Politics/status/1178047071519215616\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udea8NO10 LAUNCH \u2018FOREIGN COLLUSION\u2019 PROBE INTO REMAINER PLOTTING WITH FRANCE \ud83d\udea8 <a href=\"https://t.co/ejj7XfIKOM\">pic.twitter.com/ejj7XfIKOM</a></p>&mdash; MoS_Politics (@MoS_Politics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MoS_Politics/status/1178047071519215616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 28, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7516083/No-10-probes-MPs-foreign-collusion-amid-plot-John-Bercow-send-surrender-letter-Brussels.html\">In his story</a>, the Mail on Sunday\u2019s <strong>Glen Owen</strong> writes:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Downing Street has launched a major investigation into alleged links between foreign governments and the MPs behind the \u2018Surrender Act\u2019 which could force <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/boris_johnson/index.html\">Boris Johnson</a> to delay <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/brexit/index.html\">Brexit</a>, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.</p> <p>Sources said No 10 took the unprecedented action after officials received intelligence that the MPs, including former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, had received help drafting the Bill from members of the French government and the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/european-union/index.html\">European Union</a> ...</p> <p>Last night, a senior No 10 source said: \u2018The government is working on extensive investigations into Dominic Grieve, Oliver Letwin and Hilary Benn [who tabled the Bill] and their involvement with foreign powers and the funding of their activities. Governments have proper rules for drafting legislation, but nobody knows what organisations are pulling these strings.</p> <p>\u2018We will demand the disclosure of all details of their personal communications with other states. The drafting of primary legislation in collusion with foreign powers must be fully investigated.\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p>The Mail on Sunday does not produce evidence to back up this claim. But the main point is that there is nothing unusual about British politicians discussing Brexit with their EU counterparts. The leading Tory Brexiters Owen Paterson and Iain Duncan Smith had <a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/politics/2019/04/12/owen-paterson-mp-in-brussels-talks-over-brexit-plan/\">their own meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, earlier this year, </a>but no one started talking about \u201ccollusion\u201d. And, given that the Benn Act requires the PM to request an article 50 extension under certain conditions, it would be surprising if those behind it did not make some inquiries as to what length extension might be acceptable to the EU. The act settled on three months.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson has escalated his criticism of the Benn Act, calling it not just the \u201csurrender\u201d act but the \u201cabject capitulation act\u201d.</strong> The term surrender act has been condemned on the grounds that, by depicting the act\u2019s backers as people collaborating with an enemy, it could incite violence against them. But <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/28/boris-johnson-interview-surrender-act-like-abject-capitulation/?li_source=LI&amp;li_medium=li-recommendation-widget\">in his Sunday Telegraph interview (paywall) </a>Johnson was unrepentant about the phrase. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I won\u2019t be bullied off use of that term. It seems to me a perfectly humdrum political metaphor.</p> <p>Actually, when you read the the text of the Benn Act, the \u2018abject capitulation act\u2019 might be just as good a term for it, because it would attempt to force the prime minister of the UK to write a letter requesting to stay in the EU, and it would ... allow the EU to decide how long we would stay on in the EU.</p> <p>If that isn\u2019t an attempt of the wholesale destruction of a country\u2019s negotiating position, I don\u2019t know what is.</p> <p>So I think my language was really quite moderate.</p> </blockquote> <p>As explained before, Johnson\u2019s account of what the act does is not correct. The act says, if the PM fails to pass a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> deal by 19 October, and if MPs have not voted for no deal, he must request a three-month extension. But it does not say the UK has to accept any length of extension it is offered by the EU. If the EU did offer a longer or shorter extension, under the legislation the PM could either accept it, or refer it to the Commons for MPs to decide. So the UK would have a choice. HuffPost\u2019s <strong>Paul Waugh</strong> says if any surrendering is involved, it is not to the EU, but to parliament. (And, remember: Brexit was supposed to be about restoring the sovereignty of parliament.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/1177492744849113088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What the Benn Act really does is fetter a PM&#39;s power to decide how he wants to engage with the EU.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has ramped up speculation that he is planning to bypass a law that stops the UK from crashing out of the EU without a deal. Johnson was speaking in a long interview with Andrew Marr in which he also rejected claims that the language he was using against his Brexit opponents would incite violence. See 11.44am for a full summary. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said that her party would consider agreeing to the Irish backstop provided it were time limited. (See 6.12pm.) In the past the DUP has said that even a temporary version of the backstop would make a Brexit deal unacceptable. Downing Street has categorically denied a claim that Johnson groped the journalist Charlotte Edwardes. In a column in the Sunday Times, Edwardes said the incident took place at the offices of the Spectator magazine in London shortly after Johnson became editor in 1999. After the lunch she spoke to the young woman sitting on the other side of Johnson who said the same thing had happened to her. Describing what happened, Edwardes said: I\u2019m seated on Johnson\u2019s right; on his left is a young woman I know. More wine is poured; more wine is drunk. Under the table I feel Johnson\u2019s hand on my thigh. He gives it a squeeze. His hand is high up my leg and he has enough inner flesh beneath his fingers to make me sit suddenly upright. A Number 10 spokesperson said: \u201cThe allegation is untrue.\u201d Sources said the quote related to the allegation that Johnson put his hand on Edwardes\u2019 knee. Sources close to Johnson are said to be furious at the claim, which has been described as \u201cbollocks\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d. Dawn Butler, the shadow equalities minister, said Johnson had serious questions to answer. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has said the EU \u201ccan\u2019t last long\u201d in its current form. (See 4.30pm.) Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has suggested that delaying Brexit could cause more damage than a no-deal one on 31 October. (See 3.45pm.) David Gauke has rejected the idea that former Tory rebels colluded with foreign powers to block a no-deal Brexit, and called on No 10 to stop using the tactics and language of Donald Trump. As Bloomberg\u2019s Kitty Donaldson reports, Dominic Grieve, one of those Tory rebels, has said he has received a death threat following the publication of Number 10\u2019s \u201ccollusion\u201d allegation in the Mail on Sunday. The government is \u201clooking very seriously\u201d at making vaccinations compulsory for state school pupils and has taken advice on how such a law could work, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is the quote from Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, telling a fringe at the party conference that her party would consider agreeing to a time-limited Irish backstop. (See 5.20pm.) Foster said: In terms of the time-limited backstop, can I remind you what Leo Varadkar thinks of the time-limited backstop - he says it is not a backstop at all. And so in terms of the time-limited backstop we have said in the past it is something we would look at. I don\u2019t think it is something that Leo Varadkar would look at, but certainly if a time-limited backstop was on offer it is something that we would look at but I don\u2019t believe it is at this present moment in time. But Foster also said that she was adamant that Northern Ireland had to \u201cleave on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom\u201d in relation to customs arrangements. She said: We cannot have internal customs borders within the United Kingdom ... it has constitutional implications as well as economic implications. Actually when you think of the amount of trade we does east-west and west-east it completely blows out of the water the North-South trade. I\u2019m not saying the north-south trade is not important - it is of course important - but our east-west trade is much more important. In the official text of the speech he delivered earlier, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, is quoted as saying: On the right we have Nigel Farage \u2013 supported by the finest politician we have sent to Brussels \u2013 my sister. However we must not delude ourselves into thinking that a vote for the Brexit party does anything other than increase the risk of Brexit being cancelled entirely. But when he was delivering his speech, Rees-Mogg including four words before Farage\u2019s name not in the original text. I have flagged them up in bold. On the right we have the in many ways admirable Nigel Farage ... Rees-Mogg is an arch Brexiter and so it is not surprising that he thinks like this. And of course his sister, Annunziata, is a Brexit party MEP. But it is definitely not the approved line from Tory HQ. Earlier this month a senior party source briefed journalists that Farage and his sidekick Arron Banks were not \u201cfit and proper persons and ... should never be allowed anywhere near government.\u201d Talking of the DUP, Arlene Foster, its leader, has been speaking at a fringe meeting at the conference. Here are some excerpts. These are from the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth, Business Insider\u2019s Adam Payne, Politico Europe\u2019s Charlie Cooper, and the Sun\u2019s Kate Ferguson. In the Q&amp;A in the conference hall this afternoon the panel was also asked why there were grounds to think a Brexit deal might get through parliament now, when MPs voted Theresa May\u2019s down three times. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, replied: I think the mood has changed in the country at large, that everybody now wants to leave and start talking about other things. And I think that\u2019s true in the House of Commons as well. And I think if the DUP are happy with the deal, there will be very few Conservatives, including those who are without the whip, who are against a deal. And at that point there are a number of people in other parties who think that, yes, we must now just finish this. Here is Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the SNP leader, has posted this in response to the Matthew d\u2019Ancona tweet I featured earlier. (See 2.04pm.) In between their speeches Michael Gove, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Barclay answered a few questions on stage posed by a moderator, the Telegraph\u2019s Brexit editor Dia Chakravarty. The most interesting answers came when Chakravarty asked if they thought that other countries would follow the UK and leave the EU. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, said he did not think the EU would survive long in its current form. In response to the question about whether other countries would leave, he replied: Well, they would if they\u2019d got any sense, wouldn\u2019t they? Rees-Mogg went on: I think the problems with the euro are so deep-seated that the current Euro project, European Union project, can\u2019t last long into the future. But things often last longer than one anticipates. Michael Gove said he did not expect any other countries to join the UK in leaving. He replied: I don\u2019t think so ... I think there are particular reasons why Britain was right to leave the European Union at this time, and I respect the right of other nations to forge their own future. So, my own hunch is Britain will leave, other countries will stay, but 10, 15, 20 years on, I think we may see a very different European Union from the one we have now. For Gove, this marks something a U-turn. In 2016, during the EU referendum, he gave a speech saying Brexit could lead to the \u201cdemocratic liberation of a whole continent\u201d as other countries followed the UK and left. Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has just finished his speech. Here are the main points. Barclay urged people to embrace the opportunities of Brexit. It\u2019s time to stop apologising for Brexit, and to unleash the opportunities it offers. We can source products that we do not produce at a better price. Too often the EU restricts access to markets that want to trade with us\u2026 Like the foods that we do not grow, or the goods that we do not specialise in producing, With new trade deals with other countries we can help the developing world through trade, rather than handing out aid. To empower countries through free trade is the essence of being Conservative, and an important reason why I am a Brexiteer. He urged EU states to match the UK in terms of offering to protect the right of nationals after Brexit. We value the contribution you make to our country and are pleased that you have chosen to make your home here. We have guaranteed your rights to live, work and stay in the UK with full citizens rights for as long as you choose. Now it is time for the EU to match that guarantee. He claimed delaying Brexit would cost the UK \u00a31bn a month. And it has a massive financial cost - in extra payments to the EU. It costs an extra \u00a31bn in payments to Brussels every month we delay. This is misleading because, if the UK were to get a deal with a transition period until the end of next year, which is its stated goal, the UK would continue to make those payments. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, told the conference in his speech that MPs were holding voters in contempt. He said: The people have spoken. Ladies and gentlemen, you have spoken. We are not your leaders, we are your servants, and it is our responsibility to do what you have willed. Parliament has promised to do it, over 80 per cent of members of parliament were elected on a pledge to respect the result. The sovereignty of parliament does not come to Parliament out of a void. It comes to parliament from the people. Yet this parliament is now holding the people in contempt. They are holding you in contempt. Hence we must have a general election. It is time for a new parliament. A new egg must be laid that will not be addled. We trust the people. Our opponents do not. Gove said in his speech that the UK must leave the EU on 31 October. If necessary, the UK will leave without a deal, he said. The level of our preparations has accelerated massively since Boris became Prime Minister. Of course we cannot anticipate every risk and cannot guarantee against some turbulence. Gove also claimed that, if the UK has to leave the EU without a deal, the difficulties caused \u201cwill pass\u201d. But delaying Brexit would be more damaging, he implied. But if we can\u2019t [get a deal], then leave we must. Because, while the difficulties caused by leaving without a deal will pass, the damage to our democracy in not getting Brexit done would endure, and resound, for much longer. Our democracy is precious - and it depends on people trusting us as politicians - when we say we will put our trust in them. Gove says getting Brexit done will allow the Tories to focus on \u201cwhat matters\u201d, like the NHS, education and crime. He goes on: These are the people\u2019s priorities. They are our priorities. That is why we are the real people\u2019s party. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister responsible for no-deal planning, is speaking now. He starts with the message of the conference. 17.4 million people voted to leave the European Union in June 2016. More than have ever voted for any party, or any policy, in our country\u2019s history. But three years on that democratic verdict has not been honoured. We cannot allow this division and delay to continue. We must Get. Brexit. Done. Joking about his relationship with Boris Johnson (Gove scuppered his leadership challenge in 2016), he says Johnson \u201cdelivers\u201d. Now, I\u2019ve known Boris for more than thirty years. And while we haven\u2019t always agreed on everything, let me tell you this. Boris is brave, he is determined, he loves this country, and he delivers. And that is because Boris is an optimist. Raab says the government is committed to a UK version of the Magnitsky law - named after calls for legislation to impose sanctions on those involved in the death of the whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian jail. We will relish not shrink from our duty to take a leading role in bringing the perpetrators of the worst injustices to account. Whether it\u2019s ensuring the release of the two Reuters journalists jailed in Myanmar for reporting on the plight of the Rohingya refugees or bringing war criminals to trial from Yugoslavia to the Democratic Republic of Congo. And when we leave the EU, we\u2019ll be able to do even more. So, conference, I can tell you today that we will bring into force a UK Magnitsky law, to place visa bans and asset freezes on those individuals deemed responsible for serious human rights abuses, including torture. Raab says the UK must stand up for freedom around the world. We must never forget the lessons of history. And we must keep the flame of freedom alive in the darkest corners of the bleakest jails. For those struggling for the basic liberties we take for granted\u2026 The right you jealously guard \u2013 here, this week \u2013 to debate, to have your say, to hold your politicians to account. So, we won\u2019t look the other way, when the people of Hong Kong are beaten indiscriminately on commuter trains for exercising the right to peaceful protest. We won\u2019t stand idly by whilst journalists are jailed or beaten up for criticising the despotic regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela. And we will never rest until all those bearing UK nationality, detained on a cruel whim in Iran, are free to re-join their loved ones at home. Raab says the British are fed up with EU leaders disrespecting their prime ministers. I think the British people have had more than enough of EU leaders disrespecting British prime ministers. So, we\u2019ll strive in good faith for a deal. But if the EU spurn the opportunity for a win-win deal, We will leave at the end of October \u2026 no ifs, no buts. We want to stay good European neighbours. But we\u2019ll be free to chart our own course, as masters of our own destiny \u2013 at home and abroad, with a more liberal and energetic approach to free trade. (Raab does speculate about what EU leaders may feel about British politicians disrespecting them.) In the conference Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is speaking now. He starts with that is almost a good joke. The truth is we Brits get a warm welcome almost everywhere in world. Ok, maybe not in Luxembourg. There is one opinion poll out today, from Opinium. It gives the Conservatives a very healthy 12-point lead. And these are from Matthew Goodwin, the academic and national populism expert who likes reminding liberals that the have underestimated the potency of populist messages. Thousands of protesters marched through Manchester braving the biblical rain to demonstrate against the government. Amongst the sea of umbrella\u2019s there were drum beats, hooting and chants of \u201cBoris, Out, Out, Out!\u201d. The march named Reject Brexit, Defend Our Democracy- a collaboration between Manchester for Europe and March for Change - set off from the city\u2019s Whitworth Park before heading up Oxford Road and eventually snaking its way to the Manchester Central Convention Complex where the conference is being held. Security remained high with police are forming a \u201cring of steel\u201d around the conference venue, while hundreds of officers surrounded protestors and blocked off roads leading to the convention centre. Boris Johnson sounded confident in his Andrew Marr interview that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October. Even though parliament has supposedly legislated to rule out a no-deal Brexit at the end of next month, Johnson said \u201cof course\u201d the government would be able to bypass this law - although he would not say how. (See 11.44am.) But fewer than half of Conservative party members share Johnson\u2019s confidence, according to a survey for the ConservativeHome website. Its surveys are seen as a reasonably reliable guide to grassroots Tory opinion and this one found just 48% of members saying they think the UK will leave the EU by 31 October. Another 32% said they did not think the UK would leave by that date, and the others said they did not know - which means they also don\u2019t share Johnson\u2019s confidence. Last month 78% of Tory members thought Johnson would achieve his Brexit deadline, ConservativeHome found. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was also speaking at a lunchtime fringe. My colleague Peter Walker was there, and has posted some highlights. (Peter, author of the acclaimed Bike Nation: How Cycling Can Save the World, is something of an expert on this.) Matt Hancock, the health secretary, and Jonathan Ashworth, his Labour shadow, have been arguing about the new hospital announcement on Twitter today. After Boris Johnson\u2019s Marr interview, Ashworth posted this. Hancock claimed this meant Labour was opposing the plan. Ashworth responded. James Cleverly, the Conservative party chairman, is addressing the conference now. It has just formally opened. According to a news release put out this, he will say that the party has formally signed the armed forces covenant. The news release says: The party will now offer reduced price conference passes to veterans, proactively advertise employment vacancies to the veteran community and strive to accommodate the training and deployment commitments of reserves. The party already offers concessionary membership rates to serving or former members of the armed forces. This builds on the work of the Conservative government to support the armed forces. Since 2010, the Conservatives have enshrined the armed forces covenant in law, launched the first ever UK-wide veterans strategy and awarded ID cards to all veterans, making it easier for ex-forces personnel to access specialist support. Matthew d\u201dAncona from Tortoise says he thinks Boris Johnson was hinting in his Andrew Marr interview that the Tories could end up backing a motion of no confidence in the government this week. Marr thinks d\u2019Ancona may be right. David Gauke, a former cabinet minister, has rejected the idea that ex-Tory rebels colluded with foreign powers to block a no-deal Brexit and warned No 10 to stop using the tactics and language of Donald Trump. As my colleagues Rowena Mason and Peter Walker report, the former justice secretary, who had the whip withdrawn by Boris Johnson, responded with dismay to an anonymous briefing from someone in Downing Street that he and others had help from EU countries in drafting the Benn Act to block a no-deal exit on 31 October. In an interview with Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge, Gauke said: It\u2019s not true, and I think here is a very good example of a No 10 briefing, using the word \u2018collusion\u2019 \u2013 and that\u2019s a very potent word in itself \u2013 providing no evidence that there was anything like help with the drafting from foreign countries. Here is the story in full. The North Manchester general hospital is one of 21 NHS trust getting seed funding for redevelopment under the Tory hospital building plan announced today. On his visit to the hospital Boris Johnson said: Talking to the doctors, the nurses, the staff, they\u2019re doing an amazing job but they\u2019re doing it in buildings that were built in 1870, so this is a plan that will cost about \u00a3500m, we\u2019re embarking on that plan now, we\u2019re giving the go-ahead to them to embark on it. They\u2019ll have to take down those old Victorian buildings, they\u2019ll have to build a fantastic new site. It will cost a lot of money but we\u2019ve got to start. He also insisted that this was new money. It is new money. It is bright, shiny, new money coming out of the Treasury in a great geyser. Boris Johnson visited North Manchester general hospital this morning to coincide with his hospital building announcement. (See 9.14am.) The Brexit party has a double-page advert in today\u2019s Sunday Telegraph saying that the Tories face a choice between \u201cclean-break Brexit or surrender\u201d. It goes on: Democracy, or betrayal of 17.4m leave voters. It is time for Conservatives to make up their minds. If the Tories are not ready to deliver a clean-break Brexit - we in the Brexit party are. This is from Matthew Goodwin, an academic specialising in populism. In his Andrew Marr interview this morning Boris Johnson ruled out an electoral pact with the Brexit party. (See 11.44am.) According to the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth, in his blog about the interview, Johnson believes such a pact might be counterproductive. [Johnson] was clear that the Tories won\u2019t be fighting that election in a pact with Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party. Earlier this week, Boris Johnson told Tory MPs that the party would lose as much support as it would gain from such an agreement and I really don\u2019t see him shifting on this question. From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves The mayor of Greater Manchester has condemned an \u201cunacceptable\u201d banner which threatened Tories as they arrived in the city for their party conference, the Press Association reports. The banner said \u201c130,000 killed under Tory rule, time to level the playing field\u201d. Andy Burnham, a former Labour cabinet minister and now mayor of Greater Manchester, said the sign was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and was being removed. Tory councillor Kerry Boyd spotted the offensive sign in Manchester as she went for a pre-conference run and described it as \u201cutterly vile\u201d. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has ruled out allowing the former Islamic State member Shamima Begum to return to the UK, the Sun reports. As the Press Associaton reports, Begum, now 19, left Britain to join IS in Syria in 2015. She later married Dutch-born Yago Riedijk and spent more than three years living under the group\u2019s rule. But in an interview last week Begum pleaded to be allowed to return home, saying her only role in the so-called caliphate was to \u201cmake babies\u201d. According to the Sun, Patel\u2019s response to this request was: \u201cNo way, no way\u201d. Patel told the paper: Our job is to keep our country safe. We don\u2019t need people who have done harm and left our country to be part of a death cult and to perpetrate that ideology. We cannot have people who would do us harm allowed to enter our country - and that includes this woman. Everything I see in terms of security and intelligence, I am simply not willing to allow anybody who has been an active supporter or campaigner for IS in this country. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s interview. Boris Johnson rejected claims that the language he was using against his Brexit opponents would incite violence. (See 10.19am.) He said he was \u201csorry\u201d if the Labour MP Paula Sherriff took his reply \u201chumbug\u201d in the Commons last week to refer to the concerns she was raising about the safety of MPs. That was not what he intended, he said. He explained: My use of the word humbug was in the context of people trying to prevent me - us - from using the word \u2018surrender\u2019. When Andrew Marr pointed out that Sherriff\u2019s question was very specific, Johnson replied: In that case, that was a total misunderstanding and that was wrong. I can certainly say sorry for the misunderstanding, but my intention was to refuse to be crowded out from using the word \u2018surrender\u2019 to describe the Surrender Act. You can read Sherriff\u2019s question to Johnson in full here. It is easy to see why MPs did reasonably conclude the \u201chumbug\u201d comment was seen as a response to what she was saying about threats. Johnson claimed that he had no interest to declare when he was London mayor in relation to his friend Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s firm getting sponsorship from a mayoral organisation. (See 10.42am.) He claimed that the Arcuri allegations about him were politically motivated and driven by critics opposed to Brexit. (See 10.42am.) He said \u201cof course\u201d it would be possible for the UK to leave the EU without a Brexit deal on 31 October. Asked if this would be possible, despite the passing of the Benn Act, which says the PM has to request an extension if there has been no deal passed by 19 October and and no Commons vote for no deal, Johnson said \u201cof course\u201d. Marr asked: Can we still leave the EU on October 31 without a deal? Johnson replied: Of course we can. Johnson dismissed suggestions that he might resign rather than request on article 50 extension. This would be one way of honouring his promise not to request an extension in the event of no deal being agreed. But, asked if he would do this, he replied: I have undertaken to lead the party and my country at a difficult time, and I\u2019m going to continue to do that. I believe it\u2019s my responsibility to do that and I think that it\u2019s our job to get Brexit done on October 31 and to move the country on. He refused to say whether he had asked another EU country to veto an article 50 extension as a means of ensuring the UK has to leave on 31 October. When asked if he had done this, he replied: I\u2019m not going to get into my discussions with any other EU head of state about the negotiations, because they are extremely interesting but they are also delicate. Johnson also refused to comment on whether the government was planning various other strategies to get around the Benn Act: using EU law, using the Civil Contingencies Act or getting someone to submit the extension request on his behalf. Johnson claimed that other EU states did not want the UK to stay in. He said: It is certainly true that other EU countries also don\u2019t want this thing to keep dragging on. They don\u2019t want the UK to remain in the EU, truculent and mutinous and in a limbo, and not wishing to co-operate in the way that they would like. He claimed there was a \u201cgood chance\u201d of getting a Brexit deal. But he did not explain what it might entail. He described the supreme court ruling as \u201cpeculiar\u201d, hinting it might lead to pressure for the court to change. He said: I think that the judgment by the 11 justices was certainly novel and peculiar in the sense that they went against the Master of the Rolls and the Lord Chief Justice in extending the remit of the court into what was, I think, obviously a political question. The consequences of that decision are going to be working their way through for quite some time. You are now already starting to see a backlash of people questioning the implications of that decision. In the Sunday Telegraph this morning Johnson goes slightly further, hinting that there could be a case for having justices approved by parliament. See 9am. We are still a long way off from ministers saying the supreme court should contain an equal number of remain-voting and leave-voting judges, but Johnson\u2019s comments, and the comments of Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general on this on Wednesday, suggest that in time the argument might gain traction. Johnson did not deny a Sunday Times report saying he has apologised to the Queen. Asked about this, he replied:\u201cI\u2019m not going to go into my conversations with Her Majesty.\u201d He ruled out an electoral pact with the Brexit party. Asked about this, he said: The Conservative party is the oldest, greatest political party in the world, it\u2019s a big, broad church and we don\u2019t do deals with other parties. Presumably he was referring to electoral pacts, not deals. Only this decade the Conservative party has formed a coalition with one other party, and a confidence and supply agreement with another. (In the past it has formed electoral pacts too - for example, in 1918.) He rejected the suggestion that the claim he has announced plans to build 40 new hospitals is misleading. Asked about this, he replied: There is a long-term infrastructure plan for 40 hospitals. There is going to be seed funding for all 40. Six are going to start immediately ... that is all going ahead and I\u2019m incredibly proud of that - but there are then 34 more that are coming down the track. He claimed that Labour\u2019s plan to cut working hours announced last week would harm the poor. He said: They\u2019ve decided that they want a four-day [working] week which would hit the poorest. Labour said last week it would try to bring the average number of hours worked per week down to 32 over a decade, without workers losing pay. Interestingly, there is some evidence that the public do not accept this claim and will believe what Johnson is saying about the plan. This is from a report in the Times (paywall) on Saturday which wrote up the findings of a focus group in Stoke featuring people who all voted Labour in 2015. It said: Tony, who works at B&amp;Q, was concerned the plan to cut the working week could put jobs at risk because it would increase costs to business. Sarah said that if she worked fewer hours she would get less pay, which she couldn\u2019t afford. No one thought the plan was a good idea but most thought it had been proposed simply to win their votes. \u201cIt\u2019s unworkable,\u201d said one. \u201cIt\u2019s just idealistic nonsense, isn\u2019t it? What Labour are trying to do is hit on the things that bother people. If you work in a school, Ofsted bothers you so they say they\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d And this is what Boris Johnson said about the allegations about his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri. Johnson claimed that he had no interest to declare in this case. The main allegations is that Arcuri\u2019s company received a total of \u00a311,500 in sponsorship from a mayoral organisation when she was a close friend of Johnson\u2019s. She was also allowed to join two mayoral trade missions despite initially being told her firm did not qualify. Andrew Marr put it to Johnson that he was bound at mayor by a code of conduct saying he was not meant to take decisions to gain benefits for family or friends. Asked if he had declared his friendship with Arcuri, Johnson at first just said he was \u201cvery proud\u201d of everything that he did as mayor and that \u201ceverything was done in accordance with the code ... and everything was done with full propriety\u201d. Asked why he did not declare this interest, he replied: There was no interest to declare. This could be significant because it puts pressure on Johnson to explain the full nature of his full relationship with Arcuri. Johnson claimed that the Arcuri allegations about him were politically motivated and driven by critics opposed to Brexit. Marr asked if Johnson was embarrassed by the story, saying Johnson did not look embarrassed. Johnson replied: I tell you what I really think is going on. I really think that people can feel this country is approaching an important moment of choice, and we have to get on and we have to deliver Brexit, and I think that there is a large constituency, in parliament and elsewhere, who do want to frustrate that objective. And, rightly or wrongly, they see me as the person most likely to deliver that objective. And I\u2019m going to get on and do it. When Marr asked Johnson if he was saying this attack was politically motivated, Johnson replied: I think you\u2019ve got to be realistic if you\u2019re in my position. You\u2019ve got to expect a lot of shot and shell. Johnson made this claim even though the original Arcuri story was broken by the Sunday Times, which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum and which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, whose flagship tabloid paper, the Sun, is now one of the most fervent newspaper supporters of Johnson and his Brexit strategy. Here is a summary of what Boris Johnson said about his use of language in the interview. Boris Johnson rejected claims that the language he was using against his Brexit opponents would incite violence. He was asked if he accepted what Amber Rudd, the former work and pensions secretary, said in an interview with the Evening Standard last week. Andrew Marr quoted Rudd as saying: The sort of language I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve seen more and more of coming out from Number 10 does incite violence ... The casual approach to safety of MPs and their staff is immoral. Johnson replied: \u201cWell, obviously I don\u2019t agree with Amber.\u201d He repeatedly tried to justify the use of the term \u201csurrender act\u201d by referring to what the Benn Act does (see 9am for an explanation as to why his claims are misleading) and he defended politicians\u2019 right to use military metaphors. He said: I think you will find that the speeches of most politicians for centuries have been studded with the use of military metaphor. When Marr put it to him that there was something dark and \u201cvery 1930s\u201d about the Mail on Sunday splash (see 9am), which accuses Johnson\u2019s critics of \u201ccollusion\u201d, using a word used by a Number 10 source in a statement to the paper, Johnson said he did not agree with Marr\u2019s description. But he accepted there was a need for people to calm down. He said: I certainly think everybody should calm down. Asked if that included him, he replied: I think I\u2019ve been a model of restraint. Johnson says he will not bring back Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement. And that\u2019s it. The interview is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: The headlines say you are promising 40 new hospitals. But it is only six, isn\u2019t it? Johnson said not accept that. He criticises Labour, saying their plans for a four-day week would hit the poorest most. Johnson claims Labour\u2019s plans to cut average working hours to 32 hours a week over a decade would hit the poorest most. Q: As mayor of London you signed a declaration saying you would not take decisions to benefit family or friends. Did you declare your interest with Jennifer Arcuri? Johnson says he did everything properly. Q: Did you declare an interest? Johnson says there was nothing to declare. He criticises the current major, Sadiq Khan, saying he spends too much money on press officers. He says there are people who want to frustrate Brexit. He says these people are attacking him because he is the person who wants to deliver Brexit. You have got to expect \u201cshock and shell\u201d, he says. Johnson implies the criticism of him over his relationship with Jennifer Acruri is motivated by opposition to his stance on Brexit. Johnson says the supreme court decision was extraordinary. He says he thinks it will have long-lasting implications. Johnson refuses to confirm that he apologised to the Queen. Q: Would you resign and get someone else to request an extension? Johnson implies he would not. He was elected to take this party forward, he says. Johnson dismisses suggestions he might resign as alternative to seeking article 50 extension. Q: How would you get round the Benn Act. By using EU law? Johnson says he will not discuss hypotheticals. Q: What about using civil contingency powers? Or getting someone else to request the extension? Johnson will not say. Q: Have you asked another EU leader to veto an extension? Johnson says he will not discuss his conversations with other EU leader. Johnson refuses to say if he has asked another EU leader to veto a Brexit extension. Q: What are the chances of a no-deal Brexit? Johnson says this has not been helped by the surrender act. He says, if Brussels thinks Brexit will be delayed, they have less incentive to negotiate. But he thinks there is a \u201cgood chance\u201d of getting a deal, he says. Q: Would you ever do a deal with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party? No, says Johnson. He says the Conservative party is the oldest and most successful party in the world. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, broad church,\u201d he says. We don\u2019t do deals with other parties. Q: If there is a confidence vote next week, do you want to win or lose? Johnson says it is surprising that Labour won\u2019t vote for an election. Q: If you lost the vote, you would get your election. Johnson says people need a parliament devoted to their interests, a Conservative government with a one nation agenda. Q: So if you lose, you will get an election. Johnson says the most honourable thing for the opposition to do would be to hold an election. Johnson says, if Paula Sherriff thinks his phrase \u201chumbug\u201d applied to what she was saying about threats to MPs, he is sorry because that was not his intent. He was referring to the argument about the Benn Act. Q: Do you not accept that you have been loose and dangerous in your use of language? Johnson says the surrender act would compel the PM to write a letter to the EU keeping the UK in the EU. And the EU would decide the terms of exit. He says using martial metaphors is standard. He tried to tell a joke about John Major saying when you have your back against the wall, you turn and fight. He says politicians have used fighting metaphors for years. Q: Look at the Mail on Sunday splash. (See 9am). There is a darkness about this language. Johnson repeats his point about the surrender act. Q: Don\u2019t you think you should calm down. Johnson says everyone should calm down. Q: Including you. Johnson replies: I think I\u2019ve been a model of restraint. Johnson says, whether people voted leave or remain, they want Brexit done. Q: You said the best way to minimise threats is to get Brexit done. That sounds like a threat. Johnson denies this. He says the Brexit discussion has gone on for too long. He says the best wasy to get this is to get Brexit done by 31 October and move the country forward. \u201cThat is what we are going to do.\u201d Q: You seem to be trying to whip things up. No, says Johnson. He says people feel their vote has not been respected. He says we need to get this done. Q: Amber Rudd says your language incites violence. Johnson says he does not accept that. He says people are indignant because they know what the surrender act is trying to do. Boris Johnson is on the Andrew Marr Show now. Boris Johnson says he did not know Jo Cox. Q: Why did you say what Paula Sherriff was saying about threats to MPs being humbug? Johnson says he was not trying to make light of threats to MPs. But he was trying to make the point that politicians should be able to use \u201ctried and tested\u201d words, like surrender, to talk about legislation. Q: She was not talking about that. She was talking about death threats. Johnson says he loathes threats to MPs. Here is my colleague John Harris on the Conservative party\u2019s conference slogan. The Conservatives claim their hospital plans announced today amount to \u201cthe biggest hospital building programme in a generation\u201d. There are more details in the party\u2019s news release here. Here is an extract. As part of the health infrastructure plan, 40 new hospitals will be built across England over the next decade. Six of the hospital builds are getting the full go-ahead today, and a further twenty one new build projects (consisting of thirty four new hospitals in total) are receiving seed funding to kick start their schemes. Other projects will be able to bid into this and other future waves too. The package includes \u00a3200m to replace MRI, CT scanners and breast cancer screening equipment, so that no scanner in the NHS is more than 10 years old. And the government is today confirming that the Department of Health and Social Care will receive a new multi-year capital settlement at the next capital review to develop capacity, plan effectively, get better value for money and deliver on the commitments we have already made. The six hospitals getting the full go-ahead today are: Whipps Cross Hospital, Epsom and St Helier Trust, West Hertfordshire Trust, Princess Alexandra Hospital Trust, University Hospitals of Leicester Trust, and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. These projects are being funded with a \u00a32.7bn cash injection of brand new money from the Treasury. The projects receiving the \u00a3100 million seed funding include Addenbrookes hospital in Cambridge, the Queen\u2019s Medical Centre in Nottingham and the North Manchester General Hospital. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph this morning Boris Johnson claims that he is leading a \u201ca sensible, moderate, one nation\u201d Conservative party. One of the interesting questions to be explored this week is whether that is compatible with also being a party hell-bent on delivering Brexit, possibly the hardest version available. But a more pressing question, of course, is how the prime minister expects to deliver Brexit when no deal with the EU has emerged, he has lost his majority in parliament and MPs have legislated to try to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. This morning\u2019s papers, which are full of interviews and briefings to mark the opening today\u2019s Conservative party conference in Manchester, shed very little light on what Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy might be. But they are illuminating about his election strategy, which as we know involves depicting himself as the champion of the people, trying to deliver Brexit in the face of opposition from parliament. And one headline pushes this proposition almost to the point of absurdity. Here are the main points. Boris Johnson has suggested that the EU was involved in helping his Brexit critics draw up the Benn Act, the legislation designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. He raised the idea discreetly in an interview with Edward Malnick in the Sunday Telegraph (paywall), saying: In the case of the surrender act, we don\u2019t know whether or not for instance, the European Union has been consulted on on the surrender act, or European Commission lawyers. But a turbo-charged version of the same allegation has made the Mail on Sunday splash. In his story, the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Glen Owen writes: Downing Street has launched a major investigation into alleged links between foreign governments and the MPs behind the \u2018Surrender Act\u2019 which could force Boris Johnson to delay Brexit, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Sources said No 10 took the unprecedented action after officials received intelligence that the MPs, including former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, had received help drafting the Bill from members of the French government and the European Union ... Last night, a senior No 10 source said: \u2018The government is working on extensive investigations into Dominic Grieve, Oliver Letwin and Hilary Benn [who tabled the Bill] and their involvement with foreign powers and the funding of their activities. Governments have proper rules for drafting legislation, but nobody knows what organisations are pulling these strings. \u2018We will demand the disclosure of all details of their personal communications with other states. The drafting of primary legislation in collusion with foreign powers must be fully investigated.\u2019 The Mail on Sunday does not produce evidence to back up this claim. But the main point is that there is nothing unusual about British politicians discussing Brexit with their EU counterparts. The leading Tory Brexiters Owen Paterson and Iain Duncan Smith had their own meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, earlier this year, but no one started talking about \u201ccollusion\u201d. And, given that the Benn Act requires the PM to request an article 50 extension under certain conditions, it would be surprising if those behind it did not make some inquiries as to what length extension might be acceptable to the EU. The act settled on three months. Johnson has escalated his criticism of the Benn Act, calling it not just the \u201csurrender\u201d act but the \u201cabject capitulation act\u201d. The term surrender act has been condemned on the grounds that, by depicting the act\u2019s backers as people collaborating with an enemy, it could incite violence against them. But in his Sunday Telegraph interview (paywall) Johnson was unrepentant about the phrase. He said: I won\u2019t be bullied off use of that term. It seems to me a perfectly humdrum political metaphor. Actually, when you read the the text of the Benn Act, the \u2018abject capitulation act\u2019 might be just as good a term for it, because it would attempt to force the prime minister of the UK to write a letter requesting to stay in the EU, and it would ... allow the EU to decide how long we would stay on in the EU. If that isn\u2019t an attempt of the wholesale destruction of a country\u2019s negotiating position, I don\u2019t know what is. So I think my language was really quite moderate. As explained before, Johnson\u2019s account of what the act does is not correct. The act says, if the PM fails to pass a Brexit deal by 19 October, and if MPs have not voted for no deal, he must request a three-month extension. But it does not say the UK has to accept any length of extension it is offered by the EU. If the EU did offer a longer or shorter extension, under the legislation the PM could either accept it, or refer it to the Commons for MPs to decide. So the UK would have a choice. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh says if any surrendering is involved, it is not to the EU, but to parliament. (And, remember: Brexit was supposed to be about restoring the sovereignty of parliament.) Johnson has used an interview with the Sunday Telegraph to announce plans to build 40 \u201cnew\u201d hospitals over the next decade. As Edward Malnick reports in his write-up (paywall): Speaking as the Conservative party\u2019s annual conference gets under way in Manchester, Mr Johnson insists that spending on the NHS is \u201cabsolutely central\u201d to his vision of a \u201cunited society and a united country\u201d. He cites the \u201cconsiderable\u201d weekly savings he insists will result from Brexit as he unveils a hospital-building plan beginning with a \u00a32.7 billion cash injection for six hospitals over the next five years. The remaining projects, including up to a dozen smaller rural hospitals, will be completed over the second half of the next decade. As Malnick explains, the government\u2019s definition of a \u201cnew\u201d hospital includes a refurbished hospital. In total, the government is preparing to spend \u00a313 billion constructing what it classes as new hospitals, which officials said would involve either entirely new buildings or the gutting of existing structures to replace facilities with state-of-the-art equivalents. Johnson has suggested that the supreme court judgment on prorogation strengthens the case for submitting supreme court justices to US-style confirmation hearings in parliament. Last week Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, floated this idea in the Commons. Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph (paywall): It will take a while to be worked through. But I think, if judges are to pronounce on political questions in this way, then there is at least an argument that there should be some form of accountability. The lessons of America are relevant, Johnson is whipping up fears of rioting and deaths on the streets if Brexit is not delivered by 31 October so that he can try to invoke emergency powers and avoid extending the UK\u2019s EU membership beyond that date, Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, claimed on Saturday. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has told the Mail on Sunday that the government is considering what it might be able to do to over-ride the Benn Act. The paper says: In his interview with this newspaper, Mr Raab hinted that EU law could \u2013 ironically \u2013 be used to veto the Benn Act He said: \u2018The Surrender Act \u2013 which requires basically us to roll over to the most punitive conditions that Brussels could inflict on us \u2013 is a shoddy bit of legislation. The way it was put together was pretty ramshackle. It didn\u2019t have the scrutiny that you have with a Government Bill.\u2019 Mr Raab confirmed that ministers were examining whether they could deploy EU legislation under Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty \u2013 which enshrines Theresa May\u2019s delayed leaving date of October 31 \u2013 to over-ride the Benn Act. He said \u2018EU law has direct effect, that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re leaving. \u2018There are multiple bits of legislation that will play out.\u2019 Johnson has apologised to the Queen for embarrassing her by requiring her to approve the unlawful suspension of parliament, the Sunday Times reports. In his story (paywall) Tim Shipman says Johnson has angered the Queen. Shipman writes: The supreme court rebuke has led to a breakdown of trust between Buckingham Palace and Downing Street. A Whitehall source said: \u201cThey are not impressed by what is going on \u2014 at the very highest levels of the family.\u201d A royal source confirmed that the Queen\u2019s senior advisers are \u201cfed up\u201d. A palace official revealed that the prime minister is now as distrusted as David Cameron, who is \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d after revealing details of his conversations with the Queen while promoting his memoir. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell which of them they are crosser with, Cameron or Boris,\u201d the source said. The Sunday Times is reporting that Jennifer Arcuri told friends she has an affair with Boris Johnson when he was London mayor. Their relationship is under scrutiny because her firm received sponsorship from a mayoral fund and she got access to overseas trade missions. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, and David Gauke, the former Tory justice secretary, are among the guests on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. 9am: The Andrew Marr Show starts. Boris Johnson is the main interviewee. 2pm: Pamela Hall, president of the national convention, opens the conference. 2.10pm: James Cleverly, the party chairman, speaks. 2.20pm: Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, and Aloc Sharma, the international development secretary, speak in a session on building a safe and prosperous Britain. 3.05pm: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, speaks. 3.15pm: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Steve Barclary, the Brexit secretary, speak in a session on delivering Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will focusing almost exclusively on the Conservative conference. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "The BBC appears to have lost sight of the purpose of its procedures (BBC defends censure of Naga Munchetty over Trump comments, theguardian.com, 27 September). The BBC guidelines are not laws. They are there to guide and are, therefore, open to interpretation. They are there to help producers make editorial decisions and, when a question about a programme is raised, to help frame a response. My experience of them is that they are a handy set of tools with enough wiggle room left for programme editors to make a judgment call. Television presenters are human beings. On Breakfast (unlike, say, the news) there is a conversational atmosphere between the presenters, who are expected to interact. And unlike news readers they are expected to project their personalities. The question here is how else should or could Naga Munchetty have reacted when discussing the US president\u2019s undeniably racist, sexist and flagrantly inaccurate comments? Not to have reacted in the measured, humane way she did would have left her looking like some kind of automaton, simply spouting whatever was coming down her earpiece. Invoking the letter of the guidelines is not an adequate response. An ill-considered kneejerk reaction to a single complaint is what has set this off, not Munchetty\u2019s entirely understandable comment. Peter Grimsdale Former BBC TV executive, London \u2022 There is some muddled thinking in the Hirsch/Henry et al letter (BBC\u2019s flawed Munchetty decision, Journal, 28 September).

      "bodyText": "The ghost that haunts the pending election is the ghost of 1983. As Martin Kettle avers (Journal, 26 September), with the opposition deeply split, our antediluvian electoral system could easily lead to an extreme rightwing Tory victory, with devastating consequences. In 1983 Thatcher won 42% of the vote, while Labour and the Alliance jointly won 53%, and the rest is history. The 1983 election was not lost by the longest suicide note in history but by a split opposition. All those opposed to this increasingly undemocratic and autocratic Tory party need urgently to come together, set aside petty differences, replace the present incumbent and arrange a binding second referendum prior to calling a general election, preferably after legislating for a proportional electoral system. That could be our last defence against the very real threat of an overweening executive.

The People\u2019s Bank of China said it would step up adjustments to counter its slowing economy on Sunday, and to ensure there is \u201cadequate liquidity\u201d for the financial sector. In a statement on Weibo, the social network, the PBOC said China will \u201ccontinue to implement a prudent monetary policy and increase the strength of counter-cyclical measures\u201d. The PBOC\u2019s pledge came as the Chinese vice-commerce minister, Wang Shouwen, said Beijing would open up more sectors of the economy to foreign investors. Wang also announced that Beijing will send its top negotiator, vice-premier Liu He, to lead negotiations with the US in early October. Those talks will take place after a week-long holiday to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Recent economic data has shown that China\u2019s economy is suffering from Washington\u2019s imposition of tariffs on over half its exports to the US. Factory output growth has hit a 17-year low, and car sales have fallen in 14 of the last 15 months. China\u2019s commerce minister, Zhong Shan, told a news conference in Beijing on Sunday that the trade dispute is causing unprecedented challenges. The US president, Donald Trump, claimed last week that China wants to make a trade deal \u201cvery badly\u201d, and that it could come sooner than the markets expect.

What is ultimately needed is a substantial, long-term capital settlement which is allocated based on a clear assessment of the health care service\u2019s needs.\u201d</p> <p>The six hospital trusts will be funded over the next five years to go ahead with their building plans. The health secretary says that a further 21 trusts will get \u00a3100m seed funding between them for the building works on 34 hospitals that they need \u2013 for 2025 to 2030.</p> <p>Experts said it was hard to know how much new money the government really intended to put into the NHS.</p> <p>\u201cOn the face of it, the various schemes being pledged by the government certainly sound like substantial investment, but these piecemeal announcements are not the same as having a proper, multi-year capital funding plan,\u201d said Richard Murray, chief executive of the King\u2019s Fund, the health thinktank. \u201cThe lack of clarity around how the new schemes have been selected and how the pledges fit within the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s overall financial settlement makes it difficult to tell how generous the government is being.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister has already announced a tranche of funding for NHS building repairs. Soon after taking office, he said there would be \u00a31.8bn for maintenance and improvements, of which \u00a3850mn appeared to be new money. The other \u00a31bn was permission to trusts to increase their capital spending, which had been capped and diverted into general NHS bills for staffing and supplies during the austerity years. The beneficiaries were to be 20 projects, which included new wards, critical care and GP services.</p> <p>The \u00a33bn now announced appears to be in addition to that, and the hospital trusts that will benefit are not the same ones listed earlier.</p> <p>Hancock has also announced \u00a3200m to replace cancer MRI, CT scanners and breast-screening equipment, \u201cso that no scanner in the NHS is more than 10 years old\u201d.</p> <p>Experts say these bills will not be the end of it. Provision for staffing costs will also need to be ramped up. \u201cAs well as shoring up buildings, urgent action is needed to shore up the NHS workforce,\u201d said Murray.</p> <p>\u201cSevere staff shortages are the biggest challenge facing the health service, with nearly 100,000 vacancies in NHS trusts. If the government really wants get the best value out of this new capital spending, it will need considering alongside a comprehensive plan to tackle staffing shortages in both the NHS and social care, future plans for public health spending and investment in social care, to help keep people well for as long as possible and out of hospital when they don\u2019t need to be there.\u201d</p>",

Whipps Cross hospital, Epsom and St Helier trust, West Hertfordshire trust, Princess Alexandra Hospital trust, University Hospitals of Leicester trust and Leeds Teaching Hospitals trust will share \u00a32.7bn from the Treasury, a Conservative party statement said as the party conference opened in Manchester. \u201cWhile this money is very much needed following years of underinvestment in the NHS\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, it falls well short of the scale of the challenge,\u201d said Anita Charlesworth, head of research and economics at the Health Foundation think tank. \u201cWith a backlog of maintenance and repairs that amounts to more than \u00a36bn - much of which threatens patient\u2019s safety \u2013 and dozens of NHS trust upgrade projects that have been delayed or cancelled, the figure needed is closer to \u00a33bn each year for the next five years. \u201cSuch piecemeal funding makes it difficult for trusts to adequately plan their spending. What is ultimately needed is a substantial, long-term capital settlement which is allocated based on a clear assessment of the health care service\u2019s needs.\u201d The six hospital trusts will be funded over the next five years to go ahead with their building plans. The health secretary says that a further 21 trusts will get \u00a3100m seed funding between them for the building works on 34 hospitals that they need \u2013 for 2025 to 2030. Experts said it was hard to know how much new money the government really intended to put into the NHS. \u201cOn the face of it, the various schemes being pledged by the government certainly sound like substantial investment, but these piecemeal announcements are not the same as having a proper, multi-year capital funding plan,\u201d said Richard Murray, chief executive of the King\u2019s Fund, the health thinktank. \u201cThe lack of clarity around how the new schemes have been selected and how the pledges fit within the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s overall financial settlement makes it difficult to tell how generous the government is being.\u201d The prime minister has already announced a tranche of funding for NHS building repairs. Soon after taking office, he said there would be \u00a31.8bn for maintenance and improvements, of which \u00a3850mn appeared to be new money. The other \u00a31bn was permission to trusts to increase their capital spending, which had been capped and diverted into general NHS bills for staffing and supplies during the austerity years. The beneficiaries were to be 20 projects, which included new wards, critical care and GP services. The \u00a33bn now announced appears to be in addition to that, and the hospital trusts that will benefit are not the same ones listed earlier. Hancock has also announced \u00a3200m to replace cancer MRI, CT scanners and breast-screening equipment, \u201cso that no scanner in the NHS is more than 10 years old\u201d. Experts say these bills will not be the end of it. Provision for staffing costs will also need to be ramped up. \u201cAs well as shoring up buildings, urgent action is needed to shore up the NHS workforce,\u201d said Murray. \u201cSevere staff shortages are the biggest challenge facing the health service, with nearly 100,000 vacancies in NHS trusts. If the government really wants get the best value out of this new capital spending, it will need considering alongside a comprehensive plan to tackle staffing shortages in both the NHS and social care, future plans for public health spending and investment in social care, to help keep people well for as long as possible and out of hospital when they don\u2019t need to be there.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Houthi rebels in Yemen say they have killed 500 Saudi soldiers, captured a further 2,000 and seized a convoy of Saudi military vehicles. The extraordinary claims at a press conference on Sunday, involving still photographs and inconclusive videos of captured soldiers, many not in uniform, could not be corroborated, and there was no independent confirmation from Saudi Arabia. The Houthis, showing pictures of upturned Saudi vehicles and immobilised convoys, claimed the attacks had occurred over the past three days in the southern Najran region of Saudi Arabia, which borders Yemen, and would continue with greater intensity. \u201cOperation Victory from God is the largest military one since the brutal aggression began. The enemy suffered heavy losses \u2026 and wide swathes of territory were liberated in only a few days,\u201d said the Houthi spokesman, Mohammed Abdul Salam. He also claimed hundreds of Saudi soldiers lay dead or injured on the battlefield, and Riyadh had little option but to consider how to withdraw. He said the Houthis would end their attacks if the Saudis took reciprocal measures. The attacks, if verified, would be a remarkable show of force inside Saudi Arabia and mark another embarrassment for the kingdom, after its US-made Patriot missile defence system failed to protect two Saudi Aramco oil sites from an attack by drones and cruise missiles earlier this month. On Saturday, the Houthis claimed they had captured three Saudi brigades \u2013 a major proportion of the kingdom\u2019s army. The group also says it was responsible for the oil attacks, but this has been disputed by western and European governments. Saudi Arabia made no comment on the latest claims. A Gulf coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, intervened in Yemen in March 2015 on behalf of the internationally recognised government after the Houthis ousted Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in a coup as they seized the capital, Sana\u2019a. It was reported over the weekend that Saudi Arabia had agreed to end its bombing campaign in some parts of Yemen in an attempt to kickstart political talks on the country\u2019s future. Western diplomatic sources have confirmed a limited Saudi offer to restrict its bombing campaign to some regions and exchange prisoners is imminent. The United Arab Emirates pulled some of its troops out of Yemen earlier this year after deciding there was no possibility of an outright military victory. A week after the attack on the Saudi oil sites, the Houthis surprisingly offered to end drone strikes in Saudi Arabia. The UN security council welcomed the announcement and hinted at a process that might lead to discussions on a future political settlement. Current talks between Houthis and the UN-recognised government of Yemen are confined largely to mutual troop withdrawals from the Red Sea port of Hodeidah and measures such as prisoner releases. In a statement issued last week, the security council described the Houthi offer as \u201can important first step towards de-escalation, which will need to be followed with positive action on the ground by the Houthis as well as restraint by the coalition\u201d. The security council also gave its full support to a plan floated by Martin Griffiths, the UN special envoy for Yemen, to hold informal consultations with Yemeni political actors and establish an advisory group in preparation for the resumption of formal negotiations. In a statement, the group called on the parties in Yemen to \u201cengage constructively with the special envoy to resume inclusive and comprehensive political discussions which can end the conflict\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Voter turnout in the first round of Afghanistan\u2019s presidential election on Saturday may have been as low as 20%, according to preliminary counts, amid threats from the Taliban to attack polling stations. Afghanistan\u2019s Independent Election Commission said data from just over half the country\u2019s polling stations showed around 1.1 million people had voted for one of the more than a dozen candidates vying to rule the war-torn country, including the incumbent president, Ashraf Ghani. If the figures are consistent with the booths yet to report it would indicate that less than a quarter of the country\u2019s 9.6 million registered voters cast their ballot on Saturday, a steep decline from the approximately 60% of eligible voters who participated in the 2004 polls. An Afghan official told Reuters the turnout figure could be as low as 20%. This would be the lowest level since the 2001 US-led invasion. The Afghanistan Analysts Network said there were more than 400 reported attacks causing dozens of casualties across Afghanistan as the country voted, but none were significant enough to have disrupted the polling. Nonetheless, the election was marred was by accusations of fraud and misconduct, increasing fears of a contested result that could drive the country into further chaos amid resurgent violence by the Taliban, the Afghan national army and its western allies. Ghani had called on Afghan voters to turn out and give a mandate to the incoming leadership to negotiate peace with the Taliban, which refuses to recognise the western-backed government it routinely labels a \u201cpuppet regime\u201d. The militant group, which holds more territory today than at any point since it was ousted in 2001, denounced the elections as illegitimate and warned that polling stations would be targeted. In response, the authorities deployed more than 70,000 police, troops and intelligence officials to secure polling stations and lock down major cities. Militants attacked communications towers to take down mobile phone networks, cutting off nearly 1,000 polling stations from their headquarters in Kabul. More than 2,000 polling stations never opened on Saturday because of Taliban threats. Sixteen people were wounded in an explosion at a polling station in a mosque in the southern city of Kandahar. Many Afghans also found fault with the voting process, claiming they found incomplete voters\u2019 lists, unworkable biometric identification systems aimed at curbing fraud, and, in some cases, hostile election workers. Female voters were also prevented from participating or were unwilling to do so given requirements they be photographed, something many in the religiously conservative country are reluctant to allow, according to Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan , a Kabul-based NGO. The result will not begin to be known until 19 October, with a final announcement on 7 November. A runoff will be held among the two highest-polling candidates if none exceeded 50% of the vote on Saturday. Ghani\u2019s chief rival for the role is thought to be Abdullah Abdullah, a veteran politician who narrowly missed out on the presidency after a 2014 election tarred by accusations of massive vote-rigging. The US stepped in after that poll to negotiate a deal that made Ghani president and Abdullah the government\u2019s \u201cchief executive\u201d, but the pair have spent much of the past five years bickering and both men have ruled out entering another unity government. The poll was almost postponed to give more time for peace talks with the Taliban, but went ahead after Donald Trump tweeted that he had cancelled an American peace deal with the militants earlier this month.",

      "bodyText": "Well, there we go. Spurs were worth that in the end even if West Ham will kick themselves for missing some big chances to equalise. Their impressive adaptation to top-flight life continues but overall this was a very positive day for the sport too \u2013 a bumper crowd seeing a hugely engaging game. Thanks for joining me during it, and see you again soon! Peplow speaks: \u201cWe knew what it means to the fans, you can see what it means to the girls. The back four were solid and that played a massive part getting the result.\u201d So does player of the match Godfrey: \u201cQuality goals, it allowed us to settle down the be in the game. We were on top and got the victory. It\u2019s what we dream of as women footballers, the crowd were amazing today.\u201d Spurs take the spoils in front of this bumper crowd! 90+2 min: We\u2019ll see five added minutes though. Surely that\u2019s not quite long enough for an incredible turnaround? Thomas tries to prove that idea wrong but arrows a header straight at Spencer. 90 min: One final Spurs change, Graham replaced by Addison. They are almost home and hosed. 88 min: Neville goes down after taking what appears to be a blow to the head \u2013 there\u2019ve been a few of those today \u2013 but picks herself up and doesn\u2019t require treatment. 86 min: Those missed chances will, indeed, haunt West Ham \u2013 who try to hit back but see Spencer claim a corner confidently. And Spurs will take the points! A deep free-kick from the left causes consternation as two West Ham players struggle to clear and the substitute, seizing on the loose ball, rifles a fine strike into the bottom of the corner to clinch it! 83 min: Spurs get back into West Ham\u2019s half and earn some relief after that flurry. They haven\u2019t exactly been under constant pressure but the hosts have squandered at least three superb chances to equalise. 80 min: Another Spurs substitution, with Neville coming on for Worm. She must defend a tricky free-kick on the right edge of the box immediately ... and Spurs only just manage to do that, Thomas unable to convert before Dali\u2019s effort is deflected wide by Godfrey. 77 min: But that is the best chance of the lot for West Ham! Thomas, usually such a clinical striker, has to put that away. She\u2019s found in front of goal by an inch-perfect cross from the right by Kiernan and, adjusting herself, volleys wide from six yards when a goal seems certain. It wasn\u2019t at a perfect height but you would *always* expect her to score that. It could well be costly. 76 min: Tottenham will be pretty pleased with the way the last 20 minutes or so have gone. They\u2019re broadly in control here but need to keep managing the game astutely. A big test when you\u2019ve just come up. 73 min: The worry for West Ham is that, while they\u2019ve created two or three fine chances, they really need to start applying some sustained pressure. Dali tries to force some now and surges into space before fizzing a daisycutter a foot wide. 71 min: Now a Spurs change with Ayane, quieter this half but so good before half-time, replaced by Quinn. 69 min: Galabadaarachchi does really well down the left after a sweet move but Cho and Thomas get in each other\u2019s way when there\u2019s a real chance to cause serious danger in the box. Lehmann is then replaced by Kiernan. 67 min: I think she can, although she is clutching her neck a bit gingerly. Back on she comes. 66 min: Vetterlein takes a whack, for far from the first time today. More treatment for her, and we\u2019ll see if she can carry on this time. 64 min: Ayane is booked for grabbing the shirt of, err, West Ham\u2019s recent substitute. 63 min: Corner for Spurs. Since that Ayane chance they\u2019ve been under the cosh a touch. They come quite close here though, Godfrey getting up well to crash a header narrowly off target. 60 min: Leon, better this half but squanderer of a clear chance just now, is replaced by the exciting Galabadaarachchi. It\u2019s no slight on her or West Ham that I really don\u2019t want to be typing that too often. 59 min: West Ham certainly look far livelier at the moment and the last half-hour is set up tantalisingly. They are denied again by a superb last-ditch tackle on Leon by Percival. 57 min: Another big chance for West Ham! A really nice sequence of back-to-front passing sees Lehmann cross deep from the right and Leon, steaming in unattended at the far post, header over from a matter of yards! 55 min: The attendance displayed earlier is the second-highest ever in the WSL. 53 min: An email from Adam Kline-Schoder that I missed earlier ... \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to see Furness taking up the creative reins for Spurs here, but I do think it\u2019s a crying shame not to be seeing Gemma Davison in action today. I was really impressed with her on the opening day vs Chelsea, and am looking forward to having her back from injury.\u201d Yes, she\u2019s a fine player and an experienced one too. They\u2019ve not missed her too much yet though! 50 min: And then Ayane should make them pay but, found on her own at the far post after a swift counter, she sees Brosnan save brilliantly with her legs! What a start to the half this has been. 49 min: That really ought to have been 1-1! Spurs are caught playing out sloppily from the back and Leon surges into the box, laying it on a plate for Thomas \u2013 but some heroic defending from a combination of Godfrey and Spencer keeps the ball out! 48 min: Leon tries an optimistic effort after the ball sits up and, while it goes wide, West Ham have certainly begun with intent. 47 min: A good start for West Ham as they instantly win a corner. Baunach will swing it in from the right ...and she actually miscues it, but Peplow does exactly the same with her clearance and is relieved to see it fly just past her own goal! Spencer was scrambling there. Another flag kick results but it\u2019s cleared much more comfortably. Let\u2019s see if the Hammers can battle back ... or if Spurs can press home their advantage. West Ham make a half-time change \u2013 Dali comes on for the quiet Middag. Will that pep them up? That\u2019s excellent, it really is. Worth a read over your cuppa, this \u2013 Lucy Bronze with Claire Balding: A deserved lead for Spurs, who scored a brilliant goal from Dean\u2019s thrusting header, provided by the half\u2019s best player, Ayane. See you for the second half soon! 45+1 min: Spurs finish the half with a corner. Can they double their lead on the stroke of half-time? Short answer: no. 45 min: There\u2019ll be some treatment for Vetterlein here, who got a whack in the mouth while challenging Dean for a long throw, but she can continue. 42 min: Graham shoots well off target from range, but Spurs look confident and the likelier team to score next. Sir Trevor Brooking is watching from the stands, doubtless hoping the Hammers buck up a bit. 41 min: The hosts can\u2019t build on that just yet though and Spurs, dominating the territory, are near to a half-time lead. They try to add to it as Graham\u2019s cross whizzes beyond Dean\u2019s outstretched leg. 37 min: Leon flashes one just wide as West Ham look to battle back instantly. It actually took a massive deflection off Filbey and I can\u2019t believe no corner was given. And that\u2019s a really nice goal! It\u2019s no surprise it comes via Ayane, who is now stationed out on the left. She finds space to cross and her sublime ball in is bettered only by an *outstanding* header from Dean, who flings herself bravely at the delivery and finds the corner! It\u2019s a moment of quality worthy of the stage, and on balance Spurs just about deserve it. 34 min: Ayane is seriously quick over a distance and gallops down the right \u2013 she keeps swapping flanks \u2013 before just overrunning the ball when it seems she might do enough to get in on goal. Straight down the other end and West Ham win a corner, which is eventually cleared after being worked short. A bit more going on now. 32 min: That\u2019s close though, as Spurs break and have four on three. Furness finds Ayane to the right and she drills in a cross-shot that Dean, on the stretch, can\u2019t quite convert! That was, in terms of all-round play, probably the best moment of the game. 31 min: After a lively start this has become a bit scrappy and frayed, a few promising half-openings squandered by a lack of incision or real quality. Let\u2019s hope something turns up soon to lift this excellent crowd! 28 min: Longhurst drives through the middle for West Ham and wins a free-kick around 28 yards out. Leon and Vetterlein both fancy a dig here. The latter has a go, left-footed, but it\u2019s into the wall and away. 26 min: Spurs counter and Ayane is again in a decent position on the left, but her cross is disappointing. They\u2019ve wasted a few good positions with poor final balls. 24 min: Ayane chases a pass down the inside left and takes possession, eventually seeing a right-footed shot blocked. She\u2019s a tall, rangy player with a deceptive turn of pace \u2013 probably the more eyecatching attacker out there so far. 21 min: Redisch crosses too high for Leon from the right, but now West Ham are looking pretty lively. 19 min: That should probably be 1-0 to West Ham. A ball from the left finds its way through to Longhurst at the far post and, although the angle is narrowing, she has a clear shot on. But she opts to cut the ball back to a teammate who isn\u2019t there, and the chance disappears! 18 min: Redisch leaves the already-impressive Ayane in a heap by the left touchline and at current rate of knots we\u2019ll surely get a booking or two soon. 17 min: Furness is Spurs\u2019 main source of danger and it\u2019s noticeable that, when the ball is played into her, she\u2019s usually challenged instantly. For West Ham, Longhurst shoots straight at Spencer from range. 15 min: Now Furness wins Spurs a free-kick not far from the right corner of the area. It\u2019s a good position from which Worm can float a ball in, but Flaherty heads away well. 13 min: Longhurst, a season ticket holder with the men\u2019s team at this stadium, heads back calmly to Brosnan. Spurs continue to be slightly the more convincing. It\u2019s absolutely teeming with rain now. 11 min: Ayane takes aim for Spurs from some 35 yards after running in from the left and it\u2019s a good effort, only flying a yard or so over. 9 min: Spurs are enjoying the best of the possession, looking comfortable on the ball and playing it from side to side well. 6 min: Dean is late on Cho now. There\u2019ve been some spicy tackles in these early stages! Everyone is keen to make their mark out there. 4 min: Thomas now tries to run towards the box but is tackled. West Ham keep attacking though, working the ball nicely down the left before the ball is crossed, and three attackers can\u2019t quite reach it in the middle \u2013 Lehmann the last to try and make meaningful contact. Good, open start here. 3 min: Flaherty will be ok, for now at least. That was quite a whack but she has made a career out of being tough and wholehearted. 1 min: Graham shoots well wide for Spurs but should probably do better after running into space. Flaherty and Dean contested a thudding 50/50 challenge in the buildup, which led to the ball running loose, and the former needs treatment. Spurs, kicking right to left, get us going. The teams are on their way out here, \u201cI am blowing bubbles\u201d rings out and the atmosphere is very lively. Spurs miss the injured forward Gemma Davison here, and she\u2019s a key player for them. Excitingly for everyone involved, though, there are suggestions we may see a crowd of around 20,000 today \u2013 which would be tremendous. Elsewhere in the Women\u2019s Super League Arsenal are crushing Brighton and Man City are narrowly ahead at Everton. Both those games have under 10 minutes left. Bristol City v Chelsea kicks off at 3pm. You can keep up with all the scores right here. So Matt Beard makes three changes from West Ham\u2019s most-recent WSL match, the 1-0 win at home to Birmingham a fortnight ago. Cecile Redisch Kvamme, Tessel Middag and the exiting 20-year-old Swiss striker, Alisha Lehmann, come into the starting XI. It\u2019s a first WSL start for Norway defender Kvamme. Tottenham bring in Josie Green for Ashleigh Neville. West Ham: Brosnan, Redisch Kvamme, Flaherty (c), Vetterlein, Baunach, Middag, Cho, Longhurst, Lehmann, Leon, Thomas. Subs: Moorhouse, Simon, Hendrix, Kiernan, Galabadaarachchi, Dali. Tottenham: Spencer, Percival, Godfrey, Filbey, Worm, Peplow, Green (C), Furness, Dean, Ayane, Graham. Subs: Morgan, Wynne, Neville, Haines, McLean, Addison, Quinn. Women\u2019s football is breaking new ground across the globe and today witnesses another piece of history when the London Stadium hosts its first WSL match. Tottenham, newly promoted and with nine new signings during the summer, arrive to face a West Ham side at full strength apart from the long-term injuries to Esmee de Graaf and Julia Simic. Both teams have won one and lost one so far in the league this season but Tottenham beat the hosts 2-1 in a pre-season friendly at Rush Green Stadium. West Ham will be looking to turn up when it matters, in front of a big crowd, and with a strong rivalry between the London rivals we could be in for a derby cracker. Kick-off: 2.30pm BST",

It was in broadly the same area as the road race today. It was Blackburn and District CTC. We were a very \u2018funny\u2019 CTC section because we had a number of very fast riders involved in time trialling and road racing. Anyway, the rule was 12 hours for everything, including tea stops. It was up to you how long you stopped for, although I think there was a minimum 2 stops, half hour each. Saddle bags and full mudguards were compulsory. It was a matter of pride whose saddle bag was heaviest, a function of the tool kit you were carrying and the quantity of sandwiches. But this is the thing. I was \u2018bunking off\u2019. I was supposed to be riding the North Lancs TTA 12 hour time trial over by Lancaster. But a few weeks before, the 100 mile had been cancelled on the day due to resurfacing work on the A6. So there was no chance of qualifying for the best all rounder (25, 50, 100 and 12 hour over a season). So I\u2019d written it off. And it was raining stair rods. The whole morning. Really biblical. Like you see today! We headed to Aysgarth after Hawes, and I remember Ripon for tea, I think. I also remember a feeling of guilt about not doing the 12 hour, and wondering how the poor b@stards that did were liking it. We then headed back on the A59, into a headwind, but that dried us out, so it was actually good. This was probably in 1990. Now getting to the point! Just as today\u2019s weather and location brings back memories for me, the constellation at the front is more or less what happened throughout the Tour of Britain this year. But will it turn out better for Matteo Trentin in today\u2019s race after Van der Poel made him eternal second before? I\u2019m sure Matteo would happily sacrifice the stage race if today goes right for him.\u201d Phrophetic, David. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d90c2c28f08fbb0c171d9fb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T14:44:51.797Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Van Der Poel has cracked!</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>12km: </strong>One of the race favourites, Mathieu van der Poel, has cracked and fallen away from the front.

It means the riders will now make nine circuits around Harrogate instead of seven which may mean there is a bigger group at the finish than was previously anticipated. Will the shorter race suit some riders more than others? Possibly. </p> \n  <p><strong>Julian Alaphilippe</strong>, who lit up the Tour de France with his brave performances, is among them though the challenge from Belgium will be strong with <strong>Philippe Gilbert</strong>, <strong>Tim Wellens</strong>, <strong>Greg Van Avermaet</strong> and <strong>Remco Evenepoel</strong> likely to work well together in difficult conditions. And could we have a Dutch one-two in the women\u2019s and men\u2019s races? After Annemiek van Vleuten\u2019s stunning solo win yesterday, could <strong>Mathieu van der Poel</strong> be inspired to do something similarly brilliant today? Ben Swift and Adam Yates are the most likely challengers from Britain. Geraint Thomas chose not to ride in the individual time-trial so he will offer solid support and may even have a go himself. </p> \n  <p>Italy could provide a winner today, too. Matteo Trentin is good in the rain. <strong>Alejandro Valverde</strong> is the defending champion, but conditions do not suit him. Having finished runner-up at the Vuelta, he may not have the legs today, despite the shortened route. You can never write off <strong>Pete Sagan</strong>, either. Expect him to do something to entertain the throngs of fans in Yorkshire today. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T08:19:35.117Z\">at 9.19am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Right. I\u2019m going to wrap this up now. It\u2019s been a grim but rather epic day\u2019s racing. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been more Yorkshire if it tried,\u201d writes David Hindle. Agreed. Thanks for your emails and tweets. Bye. Here\u2019s the top 10: 1 Mads Pedersen 6hr27sec 2 Matteo Trentin +0 3 Stefan Kung +2 4 Gianni Moscon +17 5 Peter Sagan +43 6 Michael Valgren Andersen +45 7 Alexander Kristoff +1min10sec 8 Greg van Avermaet +1min10sec 9 Gorka Izagirre Insausti +1min10sec 10 Rui Costa +1min10sec Mads Pedersen has calmed down a bit now. This is what he had to say about winning the rainbow jersey: Unbelievable! We didn\u2019t expect this when we started this morning. At first [the aim] was to survive, survive, survive. When I saw the finish line I hoped the pain would be gone and I could do a good sprint. After six and half hours on the bike there is not much left. You have to be focused and stay in front. Don\u2019t get any bad luck. It\u2019s every rider\u2019s dream to wear that jersey. For me to do it now is unbelievable. Pedersen joins Amalie Dideriksen in becoming a Danish holder of the rainbow jersey. Dideriksen won in Doha in 2016. Trentin tried to force Pedersen to go to the front but when he went himself he had nothing to give and the younger Dane blasted past him on a slight uphill finish to win by 20 metres. What a finish! The Danish rider stays on Trentin\u2019s wheel and with 200 metres to go he accelerates past the Italian and leaves him for dust. What a win for the 23-year-old. He jumps off his bike and burst into tears! Kung finishes third. 500m: Trentin is second, behind Pedersen, as they climb Parliament Street. As they come round the final corner Trentin moves first \u2026 1km: Trentin lets Kung and Pedersen take the lead as they approach a tight corner near the finish. He\u2019s wary of a late crash. 2km: Stefan K\u00fcng leads, with Pedersen and Trentin close behind. The Italian takes a sip from his bottle in anticipation of the finish. He\u2019s looking very cool. 3km: Now, could a slip shake the leading three up? There are some tight turns coming into the finish as we saw with Gilbert earlier, who collided with a barrier. 3.6km: Sagan has gone for it off the front of the peloton but, as Interpol once sang, it\u2019s way too late. One imagines he\u2019s doing that to please the fans who have stood out in the rain for so many hours. 5km: Pedersen recovers and takes up the lead, with Stefan K\u00fcng and Matteo Trentin behind him. Trentin has barely done a shift at the front, the wily old soul. 6km: Out of the four remaining riders, Trentin still looks to be the strongest remaining. He\u2019s lost Moscon, though, as they chug up Oak Beck. And then Pedersen starts to rock on his bike and is battling gamely to stay in contention. And what a ride by Kung. He\u2019s grimacing like he\u2019s being rubbed by sandpaper as he leads Trentin up the short climb. 8km: The front four are now 1min 14sec clear of the peloton, that has paid the price for not chasing when they had the chance to. Moscon is doing the hard yards on the front to help protect Trentin . 10km: David Hindle writes: \u201cI remember our club 150 (miles) in 12 (hours). It was in broadly the same area as the road race today. It was Blackburn and District CTC. We were a very \u2018funny\u2019 CTC section because we had a number of very fast riders involved in time trialling and road racing. Anyway, the rule was 12 hours for everything, including tea stops. It was up to you how long you stopped for, although I think there was a minimum 2 stops, half hour each. Saddle bags and full mudguards were compulsory. It was a matter of pride whose saddle bag was heaviest, a function of the tool kit you were carrying and the quantity of sandwiches. But this is the thing. I was \u2018bunking off\u2019. I was supposed to be riding the North Lancs TTA 12 hour time trial over by Lancaster. But a few weeks before, the 100 mile had been cancelled on the day due to resurfacing work on the A6. So there was no chance of qualifying for the best all rounder (25, 50, 100 and 12 hour over a season). So I\u2019d written it off. And it was raining stair rods. The whole morning. Really biblical. Like you see today! We headed to Aysgarth after Hawes, and I remember Ripon for tea, I think. I also remember a feeling of guilt about not doing the 12 hour, and wondering how the poor b@stards that did were liking it. We then headed back on the A59, into a headwind, but that dried us out, so it was actually good. This was probably in 1990. Now getting to the point! Just as today\u2019s weather and location brings back memories for me, the constellation at the front is more or less what happened throughout the Tour of Britain this year. But will it turn out better for Matteo Trentin in today\u2019s race after Van der Poel made him eternal second before? I\u2019m sure Matteo would happily sacrifice the stage race if today goes right for him.\u201d Phrophetic, David. 12km: One of the race favourites, Mathieu van der Poel, has cracked and fallen away from the front. That came out of the blue. The Dutchman showed no signs of fatigue and then suddenly, BOOM, he went. That has given Trentin the chance he needed to strip off his rain cape and put his foot down. Surely it\u2019s his race to lose now. He has Moscon in support. Pedersen and Kung are on their own. 14km: The bell rings to mark the last lap of the Harrogate Circuit. The front five of Trentin, Van Der Poel, Moscon, Pedersen and K\u00fcng hold a 48-second lead over the peloton, many of whom are grimacing as they chug along the streets of Harrogate behind them. 15km: There is concern about whether some of the riders at the front will be able to take their rain jackets off in time for the finish. I believe they are required to display their number as they cross the line. At the pace they are riding they may not be able to take them off safely. I believe Trentin and Van Der Poel still have theirs on. 19km: The trio of riders who attempted to launch a counter-attack have been absorbed by the slimmed down peloton. Meanwhile, Moscon cracked and dropped out of the leading group but then somehow found a second wind and tagged back on to the front five. His teammate, Trentin, could do with him sticking around. They lead by 46 seconds. 21km: The peloton has let the leading group get 53 seconds clear. They will have to work as hard as they can to haul them back in as they climb up Oak Beck. They have shed so many riders that the main group has only 20 or so riders remaining, many of them Belgian or French. I think this may be a Trentin v Van Der Poel race for the prize. Cue music: 25km: The five at the front have 35 seconds on the main field and 18 seconds over the counter-attack. Trentin is looking cool in that leading group, too. Could it be the Italian\u2019s year? He\u2019s had success in Britain before. In 2018 he won the European Road Race Championships in Glasgow. And he won stage two of the Tour of Britain just three weeks ago, also in Scotland. 27km: There are two laps of the Harrogate Circuit to go and Van Der Poel leads the five-strong leading group over the line 23 seconds clear of the peloton, which is being pulled along by Nils Politt. There is a trio of riders, Insausti, Betancur and Skujins, who are trying to bridge the gap to the front, but they\u2019re flagging and trail by around 12 seconds. Their efforts may be doomed. 30km: Van Der Poel and Trentin have joined Moscon, Pedersen and K\u00fcng in a five-strong group who have a 20-second lead at the front. Will any of the French or Belgian riders make a move? The wind is picking up as the rain abates. 31km: We now have a small group of riders attempting to bridge the gap from the peloton to the leaders. It looks as though Van Der Poel and Trentin are among them. Could this be a winning move? They\u2019re just nine seconds behind the leading trio, Moscon, K\u00fcng and Pedersen. Teunisson has been dropped at the front. 33km: With the gap extending to 27 seconds, Germany\u2019s Nils Politt breaks off from the peloton and is followed by one of the Belgian riders (Dylan Teuns, I think, who won stage six of the Tour de France). 35km: \u201cIt\u2019s a smart move from Italy and the Dutch team to put men in the break \u2026 forcing Belgium and France to chase now,\u201d writes Philip Malcolm. \u201cGreg Van Arvermaert and Van Der Poel watching each other really closely in the proton also.\u201d One of those French riders, Alaphilippe, is still up at the front. Italy\u2019s Trentin looks strong, too. There may well be just the 50 or so riders who finish today. The race began with 197. Yorkshire in September will do that to you. 38km: The Belgians are bossing the front of the peloton. It looks like they\u2019re going to make a concerted effort to push on. As they leave Harrogate there\u2019s an exposed part of the course where they may use the crosswind to open up a gap and chase down the leading four. Just behind them Sagan is lurking. He\u2019s hidden away for most of the day. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have a say in this race at some point. 39km: With three laps of the Harrogate Circuit to go it looks like the rain is easing a little. The leading four riders have a 20-second lead but they are struggling to extend it. The quartet are in a discussion about what they do now. Pedersen wants to increase the pace but the other three look happy to stay at the same pace. 42km: Pedersen is doing all the work at the front as he tries to extend the gap over the peloton. But there a couple of riders behind who are trying to latch onto the leading duo. Mike Teunissen (who won the first stage of the 2019 Tour de France) is going to make it \u2013 and Italy\u2019s Gianni Moscon is in hot pursuit too. These riders have seen enough of the rain to last them a lifetime. 46km: Geraint Thomas has abandoned, while up at the front Lawson Craddock has cracked and Mads Pedersen has replaced him in the leading group having bridged the gap with a huge effort. The leaders still hold around 20 seconds over the peloton. The 23-year-old Dane Pedersen is a one-day specialist so the peloton will be wary of his move. The pace will kick on from hereonin, I imagine. 49km: There\u2019s some movement in the peloton as the cross wind plays havoc and a small group peels off the front. Twenty seconds up the road, K\u00fcng and Craddock are still motoring but I expect they will last another 15 minutes at best. \u201cHow about Why Does It Always Rain On Me by Travis?\u201d suggests Jon Preston. \u201cI can imagine a few of the riders are churning that one round in their heads.\u201d 51km: \u201cI live in Belgium and their entire coverage for the last hour has been moaning about Gilbert stopping,\u201d writes Philip Malcolm. \u201cAnd an interview with Thor Hushovd in his wellies. Trentin is a good dark horse for today, by the way.\u201d I imagine shoe shops in Harrogate have made a killing on wellies in the past week, Philip. 54km: Last year\u2019s champion, Alejandro Valverde, has just spoken to Spanish media after abandoning. He had this to say: It\u2019s a world championship for mad men Does Lawson Craddock have a look of Don Draper about him? 55km: There have been very few crashes considering the state of the weather. There has been some skilful riding out there. The leading duo cross the finish line 20 seconds ahead of the peloton, which has hared up Parliament Street. We have just three laps of the Harrogate Circuit to go. 56km: Nick Saberton adds to our bad-weather playlist. \u201cMust include Riders On The Storm \u2013 surely!\u201d Absolutely Nick. Keep them coming. 60km: K\u00fcng and Craddock, who sound like a bad Edinburgh festival comedy duo, are 28 seconds clear at the front. The peloton is being hauled along by the Dutch cyclist Mike Teunissen. Could it be a one-two for the Netherlands if a Teunissen \u2013 or more likely Mathieu Van der Poel \u2013 can follow Van Vleuten in winning the rainbow jersey? 64km: The plucky Craddock and K\u00fcng are around 22 seconds clear. If we\u2019re having songs about rain can we shoehorn in Paranoid Android or is that not bad mood music rather than bad weather music? \u201cCould I propose Carmel\u2019s Storm,\u201d asks Philament. You just have. 66km: A breakaway! Some excitement! Well, kind of. The USA\u2019s Lawson Craddock has got his legs pumping and opened up a short lead of around 10 seconds. He\u2019s joined by the Swiss rider Stefan K\u00fcng. 68km: The Italians are grouped together at the head of the peloton as they cross the line with five laps to go. Sagan is 15th and Mathieu Van der Poel is right up there as well. Geraint Thomas is still in the peloton, tucked in nicely towards the back. 70km: \u201cGiven we\u2019re only guessing at what\u2019s happening at the head of the course, how about a bad weather themed playlist?\u201d suggests James Thomas. \u201cFollowing from your (very good) Beatles track, I give you the Beta Band: Dry the Rain. Or Tupelow by Nick Cave.\u201d I bloody love Dry The Rain, James. What a track. 72km: If Peter Sagan wins today he will be out there on his own in terms of world titles. He won the road race in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Nobody has won four world road race titles. He won\u2019t be doing this on these sodden roads, though. 76km: Wahey! The aeroplane has refuelled and we have images again. Remi Cavana leads with 76km to go in a peloton that has shed riders considerably in the past hour. Sagan is still in close company but while we had no TV images it appears that the reigning champion Alejandro Valverde has abandoned. It\u2019s not a good day to be a whippet on a bike. It\u2019s way too cold. It\u2019s becoming more apparent that the winner will likely have a bit of meat on their bones. 79km: I\u2019m watching slow motion replayed images of rain falling. Oh Yorkshire! What have you done! 82km: The peloton has just crossed the line after a fourth lap of the Harrogate circuit. After four hours and 21 minutes of racing, Italy\u2019s Giovanni Visconti is leading, followed by Pieter Weening of the Netherlands, Remi Cavagna of France, Denmark\u2019s Magnus Cort Nielsen (a survivor from the breakaway) and Matteo Trentin, who is perhaps sensing that today could be his day. Mind you, Sagan is not far behind. 89km: There are only a handful of static cameras covering the race at the moment due to the wet weather so I\u2019m unable to update you fully as to what\u2019s going on up at the front. R\u00e9mi Cavagna was leading as they climbed Oak Beck, which is good news for Julian Alaphilippe\u2019s chances. Sagan was lurking nearby as well as Olympic champion Greg Van Avermaet. It\u2019s absolutely filthy in Harrogate. Cyclists are strung out all over the place at the back. Here\u2019s a Beatles B Side for you. A B side. God, they were good. 91km: Gilbert looks to be close to tears as he gets his jacket on after abandoning. He looks in a lot of pain after that nasty crash on the turn to the first lap around Harrogate. It\u2019s a sad scene but he gave it a go at least. 93km: One of the more interesting pizza deliveries I\u2019ve seen: 95km: The peloton is stretched out as riders take the sharp corners carefully as they finish the third of nine laps of the Harrogate circuit. Peter Sagan is right up there near the front and well in contention. Matteo Trentin and Pascal Ackermann are ticking along nicely too. Britain\u2019s Adam Yates and Ben Swift appear to have been dropped by the peloton and Gilbert\u2019s crash earlier looks to have done for his chances. He\u2019s chugging along way off the pace with Nairo Quintana, who seems to have run out of gas after setting the pace in the breakaway. Both look like they will abandon very shortly. 101km: Dan Martin, who led the race earlier, has abandoned. It looks like Remco Evenepoel will do the same shortly. He\u2019s dropped off the back of the peloton after using up every ounce of energy to get Gilbert back in contention. Up at the front, his Belgian teammate Greg Van Avermaet has worked his way into second place. Julian Alaphilippe is up there too. There are still over two hours of racing to go so it wouldn\u2019t be too clever to start the attacks just yet. Adrian Riley writes: \u201cIt\u2019s only fair to say that yesterday a bright and sunny north Yorkshire was full of bunting and roadside artworks to welcome the race, we spent the day painting a massive design based on a local legend on a hillside. Not sure it\u2019ll still be there now.\u201d I expect you\u2019re right, Adrian. Your artwork has probably gone the same way as the TV pictures. 105km: Here\u2019s video of the Philippe Gilbert crash. TV coverage is still limited but I believe Gilbert has got back into the peloton having been paced back by the 19-year-old Remco Evenepoel. 109km: A group of 197 riders started this race. There are now only 157 left as more and more sodden cyclists call it a day. Primoz Roglic is among them. He led the breakaway earlier, but now he\u2019s been reeled in he\u2019s decided to put his feet up and have a warm drink in the team truck. He\u2019s grinning as he gets off his bike. 111km: Limited images have just now returned. The breakaway group appears to have been absorbed by the peloton and Evenepoel has almost hauled a groggy Gilbert \u2013 and a chasing group of riders \u2013 back to the throng ahead. 117km: There are extremely limited TV pictures from the official race broadcaster now so following this race has become a little bit tricky. The plane that beams images to a satellite has run out of fuel. Yorkshire weather in September eh? What I can tell you, though, is that Rohan Dennis has abandoned having done his job of hauling the peloton along at a fair rate of knots earlier on. 120km: While Gilbert grimaces behind Evenepoel in an attempt to get back to the peloton, the riders at the front are being reeled in. The gap is down to just 57 seconds. 123km: Philipe Gilbert, one of the race favourites, has been caught up in a crash as the Belgian riders round the sharp corner before reaching what will be the finish line later on. Gilbert is hunched over as if he has hurt his chest. He gingerly gets back on his bike and is paced back towards the peloton by Evenepoel. That\u2019s incredibly selfless riding. But Gilbert looks in considerable pain. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll last much longer. 125km: The breakaway\u2019s lead is down to 1min46sec as they reach Harrogate. It consists of the same 11 men that battled out to the front some hours ago: Roglic, Polanc, Nielsen, Vakoc, Dillier, Bodnar, Kock, Houle, Howes, Quintana and Carapaz. They are cheered on to the circuit by a huge crowd in the grand old north Yorkshire town. 130km: And now the Rohan Dennis-powered peloton ups the tempo. It could be that they want to get back in touching distance by the time they get to the narrower streets of Harrogate. They\u2019ve got the lead back down to 2min55sec. Dennis couldn\u2019t do the double could he? Surely he\u2019ll run out of gas at some point. 136km: They really could have done with pedalos to tackle some of the water today. The breakaway riders have done a fine job of keeping the pace up, despite the conditions. They\u2019ve whizzed through Ripon on their way to Ripley. It won\u2019t be long until they\u2019re in Harrogate for nine laps of the final circuit, which will be tough and technical. I had hoped Ripley was the Yorkshire town namechecked in All The King\u2019s Men by Wild Beasts, so I could link to it. It is in fact Shipley. But sod it, enjoy this fine little ditty anyway while the cyclists continue on their way to the home of Betty\u2019s Tea Rooms. 141km: A few more riders have called it a day and abandoned. Among them are Paddy Bevin of New Zealand, Vasil Kiryienka, a veteran who is on the books of Team Ineos, and Hungary\u2019s M\u00e1rton Dina, who took a tumble earlier. He\u2019s obviously done himself harm and decided to throw the towel in. I can\u2019t say I can blame him. 148km: Rohan Dennis is still doing the lion\u2019s share of work on the front of the peloton with his Australia teammates. He\u2019s increased the pace again, cutting the breakaway\u2019s lead to 3min55sec. Perhaps Dennis still full of joyful beans after defending his world time trial title last week. He credited that win to his sports psychologist. 152km: Here\u2019s a video of the breakaway hitting a puddle that would be better tackled aboard a dinghy, earlier on Cray Hill. 156km: The race has settled down again with the lead group holding an advantage of around 4min30sec. The race so far has been punctuated with fine examples of how to put cycling jackets on in grim conditions. One annoyance, as a spectator, is that the jackets are not branded in national team colours, so it\u2019s difficult to spy contenders in among the peloton. Apparently, national team jackets are not as good as their own. 172km: The 11-man breakaway have gone full throttle in the past 20 minutes. They\u2019ve increased their lead over the peloton to 4min32sec. Nairo Quintana is still among them. It would be quite something if the Colombian stuck with it \u2013 he\u2019s not known as a single-day racer. 177km: A number of riders have abandoned in the last few kilometres. None of them are among the race favourites, though. Perhaps they\u2019re not strong swimmers. 182km: Among the breakaway riders, Silvan Dillier could be a good bet to stay the distance. He finished second at the 2018 Paris-Roubaix after battling away at the front for much of the day. The man who caught him was Peter Sagan. I don\u2019t think I have seen a picture of him all day. We\u2019ll see him at some point \u2013 doing a wheelie or some other ludicrous trick to impress the locals, no doubt. We\u2019ve had a few bumps and scrapes at the back of the peloton. One rider crashed into a ditch. He was fine, thankfully. The standing water is becoming more of a problem as the race goes on. 188km: The pace at the front of the peloton has split it in two. The 11 riders in the breakaway remain intact, though, and they\u2019re trying to increase the pace and extend their lead again. They\u2019ve got it back up to two minutes \u2013 but at what cost? 193km: The peloton has managed to cut the breakaway\u2019s lead from three minutes to 1min39sec in just that one climb. It might not be long before we have a bunched group again. 195km: Stewards are blowing whistles wildly as the peloton comes down the descent and rides through a massive puddle at Cray summit. I say puddle, but it\u2019s a huge stretch of water, covering the width of the road that is big enough to go fishing in. The cyclists\u2019 wheels go at least six inches deep into it as they steadily and safely make their way through it. It\u2019s a Tolkien-style scene out there. All we need is a few orcs lining the road and we\u2019re in Middle Earth. 198km: The water is flooding down the waterfalls at the side of the narrow, winding road up to the top of the Cray. A tip of the hat to the hardy folk who have lined the road to cheer on the 11-man breakaway. Behind them, the Rohan-Dennis-led peloton has got a move on and brought the gap back down to 2min16sec. 200km: The breakaway begin climbing the 7.7% Cray Hill with a 2min40sec lead over the peloton. 201km: I\u2019ve said it before. I\u2019ll say it again: it\u2019s grim out there. 205km: The USA\u2019s Alex Howes leads the breakaway over a quaint old stone bridge as he approaches the first climb. It\u2019s one of a number of steep, sharp ascents that will be energy-sapping \u2013 perhaps even soul-sapping \u2013 in the filth out there. They have a very handy three-minute lead over the peloton. 209km: The teams have been warned that there is some flooding on the road up ahead as they approach the first climb of the day just past Kettlewell. The descent could be particularly wild. 212km: We\u2019ve just had our first glimpse of Geraint Thomas. He looks very relaxed in the peloton, where riders seem to be having a much nicer time of it than the 11-man breakaway, who are extremely exposed and grimacing as they face down the rain and battle to hold their lead. 218km: Apparently, people have camped out overnight to get a good position to see today\u2019s riders zip past for all of two minutes. They love the rain in Yorkshire. Love it! One of the race favourites, the Dutch rider Mathieu van der Poel, is the latest to suffer a puncture. He\u2019s quick to pull over and get it changed before getting his legs whirring again to join the back of the peloton. The breakaway has a 2min37sec lead. 222km: The 11-man breakaway is 2min 30sec clear of the peloton. It consists of Roglic, Polanc, Nielsen, Vakoc, Dillier, Bodnar, Kock, Houle, Howes, Quintana and Carapaz. A vicious wind is really whipping across them as they battle on into the Dales. The peloton can better shield each other from these conditions. With over 200km to go the riders in the breakaway are going to have to be heroic to stay clear. 225km: The lead over the peloton has stretched to over two minutes. I\u2019ve just seen a rider relieving himself at the side of the road. Surely he could have held it for longer than 30km. Too much coffee? 230km: Rohan Dennis and most of his Australian teammates are leading the peloton in cool and collected fashion about a minute and 25 seconds down the road from the leading group, which has now swollen to around 11 riders after Quintana\u2019s chasing pack caught them. They\u2019re snaking their way through Skipton, where standing water is causing them to slow up around the sharp corners. 234km: It looks like the race is finally taking shape. Polanc, Koch and Carapaz have a 10-second lead over a chasing group of around 10 riders, including Roglic, Quintana, Nielsen, Houle and Howes. Quintana looks completely in the zone and unfazed by the filthy weather as they approach Skipton. That chasing group have a minute on the peloton now too, and will no doubt join the leading trio. 238km: The peloton looks to be splitting in two as it rumbles along at a terrific pace. Jan Polanc had been out on his own with a short lead of around 11 seconds but, mercifully, he is joined by Jonas Koch and Richard Carapaz, who has pedigree having won the Giro D\u2019Italia this year. 242km: The riders whizz through Ilkley. It\u2019s a grand old town. I went there on holiday for a few days in February, when the weather was actually much nicer than it is today. There\u2019s another attempt at a breakaway at the front, with Jan Polanc, Daniel Felipe Martinez Poveda and Maciej Bodnar going hell for leather to try and keep the peloton at bay. I don\u2019t think they will be successful, though. 246km: Philippe Gilbert has suffered a front wheel puncture and requires a wheel change. There have been a fair few riders who look to have had mechanical issues so far. Julian Alaphilippe appears to be unhappy with his bike, too. He\u2019s involved in a conversation with a mechanic in his team car. It\u2019s tough out there. With the pace at the front, Gilbert and Alaphilippe could do without this. 250km: The breakaway fails to get away and the riders are just about grouped together again as they race down an A-road in awful conditions. I say they\u2019re grouped together but in fact they\u2019re rather strung out thanks to the rapid pace at the front. 253km: Martin has been joined by Primoz Roglic and Tom Wirtgen in a group of around six riders. The peloton look like they will reel them back in shortly, though, as they whizz through Otley. Roglic reached a speed of 97km per hour as he came down a sharp descent just then. In the rain! 259km: The racing begins in earnest along undulating roads out near Otley. And Ireland\u2019s Dan Martin has attacked immediately. He\u2019s a vision in green as he attempts to put clear air between himself and the front of the peloton. He will have preferred the longer course, one assumes, given his strength on the short climbs that have been removed. \u201cThe news is in. Some riders are not wearing national team branded, bad weather gear,\u201d writes David Hindle. \u201cThis is even worse than a sock length infringement. Surely, the UCI must act? But this time, before the offenders reach the finishing circuit. It will certainly change the race outcome, but for the good of cycling, 40 plus riders must be DQ\u2019d immediately!\u201d You\u2019re a strict man, David. In terms of knowing who is who out there, it may be very tricky when they get out into the Yorkshire Moors. The TV helicopters have been grounded by the wet weather. There\u2019s going to be some harum-scarum riding out there, one imagines. Hopefully nothing quite as bad as this: The riders are rolling out of Leeds in a 10km neutralised zone. It\u2019s tipping it down and many of them a wrapped up like it\u2019s December. The racing proper will start when they get to the city\u2019s outskirts. Good morning! Yorkshire in September was always going to be wet and wild for the Road Race World Championships and severe weather conditions have led to today\u2019s route being shortened from 284.5km to 261km, with a shortcut from near Aysgarth to Leyburn being taken to avoid dangerous roads. It means the riders will now make nine circuits around Harrogate instead of seven which may mean there is a bigger group at the finish than was previously anticipated. Will the shorter race suit some riders more than others? Possibly. Julian Alaphilippe, who lit up the Tour de France with his brave performances, is among them though the challenge from Belgium will be strong with Philippe Gilbert, Tim Wellens, Greg Van Avermaet and Remco Evenepoel likely to work well together in difficult conditions. And could we have a Dutch one-two in the women\u2019s and men\u2019s races? After Annemiek van Vleuten\u2019s stunning solo win yesterday, could Mathieu van der Poel be inspired to do something similarly brilliant today? Ben Swift and Adam Yates are the most likely challengers from Britain. Geraint Thomas chose not to ride in the individual time-trial so he will offer solid support and may even have a go himself. Italy could provide a winner today, too. Matteo Trentin is good in the rain. Alejandro Valverde is the defending champion, but conditions do not suit him. Having finished runner-up at the Vuelta, he may not have the legs today, despite the shortened route. You can never write off Pete Sagan, either. Expect him to do something to entertain the throngs of fans in Yorkshire today.",

      "bodyText": "Nigeria has been warned it risks a humanitarian disaster if the government goes ahead with its threat to throw aid agencies out of the north-east of the country, claiming they are in league with extremist Islamic groups. A spate of aid offices have been forcibly shut after unproven claims they have been acting as conduits for cash that has ended up with Boko Haram, or Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap). The Nigerian army is stepping up its 10-year effort to drive out extremists and claims that despite several warnings, agencies continue to provide aid to terrorist groups. Two aid agencies have had offices closed in the past few days, and there are fears in the charity sector that Nigeria is targeting as many as 10 independent humanitarian organisations. Talks are under way to try to defuse the breakdown in relations, and the charities say they often avoid transporting cash by road to avoid the risk of seizure. The reprisals came at the same time as the execution of a kidnapped Nigerian aid worker last Wednesday by extremists. The charity worker was among six aid workers employed by the Paris-based charity Action Against Hunger captured in July by Boko Haram during an ambush on a convoy close to the border with Niger. Action Against Hunger is the biggest NGO involved the international humanitarian response in the region. On 18 September, its office in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, was forcibly shut by the Nigerian army without warning or notice. The army claimed it had credible intelligence the charity was one of a number involved in subversive activities and was aiding and abetting terrorists, including by supplying drugs and food to extremist groups. In an angry rebuttal, Action Against Hunger said it strongly rejected the accusation. \u201cAction Against Hunger delivers neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian aid to millions of people in Borno and Yobe states by providing basic services to the most vulnerable people, especially women and children,\u201d the charity said. Action Against Hunger said it was ready \u201cto support any investigation, and will work tirelessly with the Nigerian authorities to allay any concerns they may have about our operations in the region\u201d. Another international aid agency, Mercy Corps, also said it had suspended operations in the north-eastern Borno and Yobe states, two of the worst affected by the violence. The Nigerian army had closed five of its offices, initially not providing any official explanation. Boko Haram effectively runs four of the 10 zones inside Borno, near Lake Chad, but the army and the government are reluctant to admit the counter-insurgency is failing. Mercy Corps\u2019 head of media and communications, Amy Fairbairn, confirmed the organisation was seeking to work with the Nigerian army to resolve the position. In December 2018, the army also suspended Unicef from operating in the north-east over claims it was training \u201cspies\u201d who supported Boko Haram \u2013 only to lift the ban later the same day after a meeting with the aid agency. Iswap is a splinter faction of Boko Haram that swore allegiance in 2016 to the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It has repeatedly attacked military bases and targeted aid workers in north-east Nigeria. The UN humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, said he was appalled by the killing of the aid workers and \u201cextremely concerned by the increasingly dangerous and restrictive operating environment for humanitarian assistance\u201d. In remarks aimed at the Nigerian army, he insisted the humanitarian community was working in line with the agreement reached between the government and aid workers, in place until 2021, to provide assistance to 6.2 million of the most vulnerable people. The army has announced a fresh nationwide crackdown, starting on 7 October, designed to find and arrest criminals and terrorists. Jeremy Hunt, the then foreign secretary, visited the area earlier this year, where he was briefed by a small British military team helping to advise the Nigerian army, but the degree of the UK military\u2019s day-to-day influence over the Nigerian army\u2019s strategy can be exaggerated. One worker from an aid agency based in Nigeria that could not be named for fear of reprisals said: \u201cIf humanitarian agencies are kicked out of north-east Nigeria then thousands of Nigerian civilians will needlessly die, including many children \u2013 it will be a humanitarian disaster. \u201cSomeone needs to ask the Nigerians and the UN some serious questions about how the government of Nigeria is getting away with this while it sits on stage in New York, presiding over the UN general assembly and preaching about ending conflict and fighting poverty in the drive to reach the sustainable development goals.\u201d The war with Boko Haram has devastated the population in rural north-east Nigeria, one of the poorest regions on earth. More than 2 million people have fled their homes, tens of thousands have been killed, and many more injured, abducted and conscripted to join the fight. Last month, the International Committee of the Red Cross said about 22,000 Nigerians had been reported missing during the decade-long crisis, nearly half of them minors.",

This crisis is entirely the outcome of one man\u2019s device to seize control of his party.</p> <p>From the moment Johnson began his final climb to power, his appeal has been crudely populist.

On Brexit, he has distorted a near trivial \u201cfreedom to trade with the rest of the world\u201d with claptrap about vassalage, sovereignty and patriotism.

It goes back to the tactic adopted by the McCarthyites in the 1950s, when any victim of Joseph McCarthy and his young lawyer Roy Cohn would be assailed with wildly repetitive accusations of communism and homosexuality.

      "bodyText": "I cannot recall a more critical week in British politics. It will decide whether parliament, the law and public opinion can hold the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to account, or whether a new poison has entered public life. We need constantly to remember that Britain faces no menace to its security or prosperity. It could by now be outside the EU with agreed terms of trade. This crisis is entirely the outcome of one man\u2019s device to seize control of his party. From the moment Johnson began his final climb to power, his appeal has been crudely populist. He has discarded the core Tory tradition of fiscal probity with a welter of spending pledges and tax cuts, plus plans for immigration control and toughness on crime. On Brexit, he has distorted a near trivial \u201cfreedom to trade with the rest of the world\u201d with claptrap about vassalage, sovereignty and patriotism. The idea that Brexit will bring a new dawn of national wealth is absurd. It is simply how Johnson became prime minister. So far, so familiar. What is novel about the current upheaval is the attempted disruption of political convention. This has little to do with Johnson but with his bizarre aide, Dominic Cummings, whose control over his seemingly disoriented boss appears total. Cummings\u2019 tactic is brittle, divisive and implacable, though its effectiveness cannot be overrated. Polls showed scant support for Johnson over his supreme court defeat, but his party remains a full 13 points ahead of Labour. Johnson\u2019s theatrical belligerence \u2013 which he absurdly told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday was \u201cmisunderstood \u2026 a model of restraint\u201d \u2013 is a trope borrowed from US politics, seen most vigorously in the antics of Donald Trump. It goes back to the tactic adopted by the McCarthyites in the 1950s, when any victim of Joseph McCarthy and his young lawyer Roy Cohn would be assailed with wildly repetitive accusations of communism and homosexuality. Cohn\u2019s tactic was \u201cto bring out the worst in my enemies; that\u2019s how I get them to defeat themselves\u201d. He would \u201cgo after a man\u2019s weakness, and never threaten unless you mean to follow through to the end\u201d.

The UK\u2019s biggest energy supplier hopes to harness household gadgets with energy capacity equivalent to a large power plant by 2025. The plan could help to balance the energy system without any perceptible impact for British households. Centrica said it has developed sophisticated software algorithms to harness thousands of smart appliances to respond when the energy system is under stress. These devices will automatically use electricity when there is ample renewable energy on the grid, and then pause their energy use when National Grid needs help steadying the energy system. Similar schemes have already begun pooling the energy potential of supermarket freezers and electric vehicle batteries, but this is the first time that home devices will help balance the grid too. Centrica\u2019s innovation arm said National Grid had approved its plans to use home water tanks, built by a tech startup from Oxford University, alongside larger industrial equipment to deliver services that could automatically balance the electricity system. Charles Cameron, the chairman of Centrica Innovations, said the software could help homes save money by using electricity when it was at its cheapest and automatically responding at times of stress without any loss of efficiency or comfort for customers. The home devices will be aggregated alongside Centrica\u2019s existing flexible power supplies, totalling 2.5GW of electricity capacity, mostly from business and industrial customers. Mixergy, the tech company behind the smart hot water tanks, said the technology will help consumers use less energy. The tank uses artificial intelligence to learn how much hot water a household uses, and at which times of day, to make sure that it doesn\u2019t waste energy when hot water is unlikely to be needed. Pete Armstrong of Mixergy said the technology could pave the way for new energy tariffs, which would \u201creduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by storing excess renewable energy on the grid\u201d. \u201cAt the same time, we reduce bills for householders by only heating the amount of hot water they require,\u201d he added. Centrica has rolled out around 100 smart water heaters since June this year, but within the next six years it hopes to grow its stable of fast-response devices to 1GW. \u2022 See if you can switch supplier and save money with the Guardian",

      "body": "<h2><strong>1. Ask about antivirals</strong><br></h2> <p>If you are beginning to show flu symptoms, you can ask your doctor about prescription <a href=\"http://www.nhsborders.scot.nhs.uk/media/209209/Antiviral-medication-June-2014.pdf\" title=\"\">antiviral drugs</a> such as oseltamivir (sold as Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). Both work by blocking an enzyme that helps the virus infect new cells. These drugs are most effective if you take them within 48 hours of your first symptoms and can shorten your bout of flu by a day, although the risk of side-effects mean they will not always be prescribed. It is particularly important to request antivirals if you have a condition such as diabetes or heart disease that increases the risk of complications.</p> <h2><strong>2. Get lots of sleep</strong><br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159114005108\" title=\"\">Research</a> has shown that getting plenty of sleep keeps the immune system healthy and is crucial to the body\u2019s ability to keep white blood cell counts high and battle infections. It can also help prevent you from getting flu in the first place, especially if you have had a flu jab, as the body will then be able to produce more antibodies to respond to the immunisation and protect you.</p> <h2><strong>3. Watch what you drink and eat</strong><br></h2> <p>Whether it is hot soup, water or fruit juice, many experts believe it is important to drink a minimum of<a href=\"https://healthengine.com.au/info/cold-and-flu-what-to-eat-and-drink-to-get-better-faster\" title=\"\"> eight 250ml cups of fluid</a> a day during a bout of flu. Common flu symptoms such as sweating and runny noses increase the amount of water your body loses, so keeping up your fluid intake prevents dehydration. Drinking also relieves congestion, stopping mucus building up in your lungs, which could lead to pneumonia. Foods high in vitamin C, such as kiwifruit and green peppers, as well as those rich in the antioxidant beta-carotene, such as carrots, sweet potatoes and squash, can help boost your immune system.</p> <h2><strong>4. Keep warm and stay home</strong><br></h2> <p>Staying warm when you first go down with flu helps the body preserve its energy for the immune battle. Experts recommend staying home from work and resting until you are fever-free for at least 24 hours to avoid passing on the virus. This can also reduce the risk of developing complications such as pneumonia.</p> <h2><strong>5. Try NAC supplements</strong><br></h2> <p>N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC) is a powerful antioxidant. Research has shown it can reduce both the duration and severity of flu by boosting immunity, reducing respiratory mucus and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000629520900728X\" title=\"\">inhibiting the ability of the virus to replicate</a>. </p>",

Watch what you drink and eat Whether it is hot soup, water or fruit juice, many experts believe it is important to drink a minimum of eight 250ml cups of fluid a day during a bout of flu. Common flu symptoms such as sweating and runny noses increase the amount of water your body loses, so keeping up your fluid intake prevents dehydration. Drinking also relieves congestion, stopping mucus building up in your lungs, which could lead to pneumonia. Foods high in vitamin C, such as kiwifruit and green peppers, as well as those rich in the antioxidant beta-carotene, such as carrots, sweet potatoes and squash, can help boost your immune system. 4. Keep warm and stay home Staying warm when you first go down with flu helps the body preserve its energy for the immune battle. Experts recommend staying home from work and resting until you are fever-free for at least 24 hours to avoid passing on the virus. This can also reduce the risk of developing complications such as pneumonia. 5. Try NAC supplements N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC) is a powerful antioxidant. Research has shown it can reduce both the duration and severity of flu by boosting immunity, reducing respiratory mucus and inhibiting the ability of the virus to replicate.",

      "body": "<p>Daniel Halliday says that being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was one of the best things that ever happened to him. That\u2019s because before receiving his diagnosis in October 2017, Halliday was depressed and housebound. He had become agoraphobic after being mugged at knifepoint in 2014, and was unable to work. On a typical day, he would wake up, play video games and eat: fried breakfasts, pizza, Pringles and sweets. Oh, and Greggs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always said that Greggs was one of the major contributors to my diabetes,\u201d Halliday sighs.</p> <p>At his heaviest, he weighed 136kg (21st 6lb) and had a 42-inch waist.</p> <p>The diabetes diagnosis came as a shock. At first, Halliday, a 34-year- old NHS worker from Thornby, Northamptonshire, went into denial. \u201cI thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to eat whatever I want, I don\u2019t care.\u201d But an unrelated health scare in March 2018 gave him the jolt he needed. Halliday started venturing outside the house, to the end of the street at first, then further. He eliminated fatty, carbohydrate-rich and processed foods from his diet<strong> </strong>\u2013 no more pasties and crisps. He started playing badminton and football.</p> <p>The pounds fell off \u2013 he now weighs 95kg (15st) and his diabetes is in remission. More importantly, Halliday got his life back. \u201cIt shook me out of my bad lifestyle. It was a blessing in disguise. It made me realise how much of my life I was wasting by not living it to the full.\u201d</p> <p>Halliday was able to manage his diabetes through diet and exercise, because he has type 2 diabetes. Not to be confused with type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition which is not associated with lifestyle, type 2 diabetes is very often linked to obesity and inactivity. Three out of five cases of type 2 diabetes are preventable, but the consequences can be severe. People with diabetes can go blind, have heart attacks or strokes, or require amputations. The life-expectancy of someone with <a href=\"https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-life-expectancy.html\" title=\"\">type 2 diabetes is reduced by a decade.</a> It is a horrible, frightening disease \u2013 which is why Kelly Perrin, a 31-year-old finance worker from Rushden, Northamptonshire, burst into tears when she was diagnosed in January. \u201cI knew it was serious,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bad79c6bfe8a1ec8e5f68010a9cd5493fdeb505c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bad79c6bfe8a1ec8e5f68010a9cd5493fdeb505c/0_164_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kelly Perrin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kelly Perrin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kelly Perrin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although it was once believed to be an inevitably degenerative disease, the good news is that <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j4030\" title=\"\">a landmark 2017 paper from researchers at the University of Glasgow and the University of Newcastle</a> found that patients who lost significant amounts of weight \u2013 about 15kg \u2013 were able to send their type 2 diabetes into remission.

A few years ago, that didn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p> <p>The reason type 2 diabetes is on the rise is that we are getting fatter and becoming more inactive. <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/338934/Adult_obesity_and_type_2_diabetes_.pdf\" title=\"\">Ninety per cent of adults with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese</a>, and obese adults are five times more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than those who are not.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are consuming too much sugar, salt and saturated fat, and they aren\u2019t reaching the recommended levels of physical activity,\u201d says Riley. Environmental factors also play a part: our increasingly sedentary lifestyles, and readily accessible, cheap processed food. \u201cWe live in an unhealthy society where it\u2019s not always easy for people to make healthy choices,\u201d Riley explains. Perrin struggles to resist the confectionery aisle. \u201cSugar is literally everywhere \u2013 it\u2019s in the chocolates by the till in the supermarket, in nice bright colours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNowadays, they say you should have your five a day,\u201d says Emma, a 34-year-old parent from Cumbria. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at 28. \u201cThere was nothing like that when I was young. We all grew up on cheese on toast and chips and beans, so that\u2019s what I fed my kids.\u201d</p> <p>Emma had her first child at 18 \u2013 and money was tight. \u201cWe lived off benefits for a while. You went for the cheapest option, which was usually a bag of chips or cheese on toast.\u201d After her diagnosis, Emma learned about nutrition. \u201cI feed my kids better now,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the damage is done for me.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone who develops type 2 diabetes is overweight. There is also a genetic component, <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/diabetes/higher-diabetes-risk-in-asians-explored/\" title=\"\">and BAME communities are more susceptible</a>. Sian Bailey, 25, a teacher from the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, was diagnosed in June. A dress size 10, Bailey is slim \u2013 but she blames her poor diet for her diagnosis. \u201cI ate for convenience rather than eating healthy foods \u2026 I\u2019d pick up the easiest, cheapest food.\u201d Bailey would eat three takeaways a week, usually McDonald\u2019s or Chinese food.</p> <p>She is determined to manage her condition through diet. \u201cI\u2019m only 25. I\u2019ve damaged my body so much already. I want to do the best I can so I don\u2019t end up in hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Sending your type 2 diabetes into remission using diet alone takes serious discipline. But the alternative \u2013 a lifetime on medications, which don\u2019t always work \u2013 is worse. \u201cPatients can be taking 10 or even 12 drugs which don\u2019t control all their symptoms or prevent disease progression,\u201d says Prof Mike Lean of the University of Glasgow, co-author of the 2017 study that showed type 2 diabetes could be reversed through diet. \u201cThe pain from nerve damage can be awful. It progresses with infections, ulcers, amputations, blindness, kidney failure and dementia. Patients are often in hospital for months on end.\u201d</p> <p>In order to reverse a type 2 diagnosis using diet, patients should eat 600 calories a day for six weeks. The so-called Newcastle Diet advises patients to consume three diet shakes a day, to take them up to 600 calories in total, with a further 200 daily calories of non-starchy vegetables permitted to supplement the diet. In tests conducted at Newcastle University, seven out of 11 people who followed this diet were free of diabetes within three months.</p> <p>It is important to note that they are not cured of diabetes \u2013 the disease only goes into remission. Should they regain the weight, the diabetes may come back. \u201cIf you can lose enough weight, you can get rid of the extra fat that is upsetting your liver and affecting the way your pancreas functions,\u201d says Lean. \u201cThings go back pretty much to normal. The best way to avoid complications from diabetes is to not have diabetes.\u201d</p> <p>University lecturer John Thomas, 42, from Bangor, is one success story. After being diagnosed in 2015, Thomas was prescribed the blood-sugar and insulin-modulating drug metformin. One day, he heard Dr Michael Moseley talking about how type 2 diabetes can be reversed on the radio. \u201cI filed his name away in the back of my mind, thinking: \u2018I must look him up\u2019,\u201d he says. A few weeks later, his wife watched a documentary called The Truth about Carbs and collared him. \u201cShe said: \u2018You\u2019ve got to do something about this.\u2019\u201d After carefully reviewing the academic literature \u2013 he is a scientist by training \u2013 Thomas went on a low-carbohydrate, low-calorie regime. (Like Thomas, type 2 diabetes sufferers can experience successful weight loss by severely restricting their carbohydrate intake.)</p> <p>\u201cThe most surprising aspect of it all was that I wasn\u2019t hungry at all,\u201d Thomas says. He continued eating his usual diet of vegetarian curries, but gave up rice, bread and sweets. The weight melted off. Thomas sends me a graph tracking his blood sugar while on the diet \u2013 the line plummets vertically, like a bird falling out of the sky. His diabetes is now in remission. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge weight off my mind,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Not everyone finds it so easy. Ultra-low-calorie diets are tough, particularly if you struggle to find time to cook. Emma wants to lose weight, but it just feels impossible. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to make healthy choices a lot of the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI have four children who won\u2019t eat the same food, so I\u2019m running around after them, and then I\u2019m left to last, so I just grab a sandwich.\u201d</p> <p>She is not following a low-calorie regime, and worries about her long-term health. \u201cWhen I go to bed at night, I think: \u2018I must make this change tomorrow.\u2019\u201d She hopes to start the low-calorie diet when her youngest daughter starts nursery. \u201cThen I can focus on me a bit more. Because one of my worst fears is having a leg amputated, or going blind.\u201d</p> <p>Perrin has been trying to stick to a low-calorie diet, but finds it hard to unlearn the eating habits of a lifetime. \u201cI eat because of boredom,\u201d Perrin says. \u201cIt gives you something to do when you\u2019re watching the telly.\u201d Quitting sugar floored her. \u201cI felt awful.\u201d She has, though, lost half a stone so far, and is hoping to send her diabetes into remission. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard,\u201d she says.</p> <p>How to incentivise people to lose weight? \u201cIt\u2019s about education,\u201d says Riley. \u201cMaking sure people understand the risks, so they can take preventative steps like amending their diet and becoming more active, before it is too late.\u201d</p> <p>Riley welcomes <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-measures-announced-to-halve-childhood-obesity-by-2030\" title=\"\">the government\u2019s commitment to halving childhood obesity by 2030, and is supportive of the sugar tax</a>. But we need public-health interventions on a broader scale if we are to halt the diabetes epidemic. Lean calls for root-and-branch reform of our national eating habits. \u201cWe need to go back to how our parents and grandparents ate. Whole grains, pulses, vegetables \u2013 and meat for special occasions.\u201d</p> <p>Being fat is stigmatised \u2013 and type 2 diabetes sufferers are often unfairly judged. \u201cTo a certain extent, I\u2019ve got the body I deserve,\u201d says Perrin. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten a lot of crap over the years. But it isn\u2019t purely self-inflicted.\u201d Emma doesn\u2019t tell most people about her diagnosis, because she finds it embarrassing. When she goes out for lunch with friends who know, she worries that they are watching what she eats.</p> <p>\u201cI think: \u2018Are they going to judge me for my choices?\u2019\u201d Her mother berates her too. \u201cShe has all the time in the world to go to the gym,\u201d Emma says.</p> <p>The public-health messaging around type 2 diabetes is tricky \u2013 you don\u2019t motivate people like Emma to make healthier choices by shaming them. But we must get it right because this is an unprecedented public-health emergency. Lean is hopeful that we will see the sort of radical consciousness-changing around obesity that we have witnessed with the climate emergency.</p> <p>\u201cPreventing diabetes must start among young people. We have Greta Thunberg out there showing that young people can grasp all sorts of things \u2026 We need to bring young people up to speed. Diabetes is a deadly, serious disease, and we all need to stop it.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas is evangelical about showing other people with diabetes that it can be reversed through diet. Unfortunately, he isn\u2019t always successful \u2013 his mother and brother back home in Chennai are pre-diabetic, but won\u2019t listen. \u201cThey think it\u2019s too hard,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cThey say: \u2018You\u2019ve got the will and determination, but we don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Halliday is also spreading the message in between his packed schedule (the former agoraphobic is currently rehearsing for an am-dram production of The Addams Family). \u201cI want to empower people to believe it can be done,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I was a hermit living in my own home. If I can do it, anyone can.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 October 2019 to clarify the distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The former is an autoimmune condition. Type 1 is not associated with lifestyle, whereas type 2 is. </p>",

It is important to note that they are not cured of diabetes \u2013 the disease only goes into remission. Should they regain the weight, the diabetes may come back. \u201cIf you can lose enough weight, you can get rid of the extra fat that is upsetting your liver and affecting the way your pancreas functions,\u201d says Lean. \u201cThings go back pretty much to normal. The best way to avoid complications from diabetes is to not have diabetes.\u201d University lecturer John Thomas, 42, from Bangor, is one success story. After being diagnosed in 2015, Thomas was prescribed the blood-sugar and insulin-modulating drug metformin. One day, he heard Dr Michael Moseley talking about how type 2 diabetes can be reversed on the radio. \u201cI filed his name away in the back of my mind, thinking: \u2018I must look him up\u2019,\u201d he says. A few weeks later, his wife watched a documentary called The Truth about Carbs and collared him. \u201cShe said: \u2018You\u2019ve got to do something about this.\u2019\u201d After carefully reviewing the academic literature \u2013 he is a scientist by training \u2013 Thomas went on a low-carbohydrate, low-calorie regime. (Like Thomas, type 2 diabetes sufferers can experience successful weight loss by severely restricting their carbohydrate intake.) \u201cThe most surprising aspect of it all was that I wasn\u2019t hungry at all,\u201d Thomas says. He continued eating his usual diet of vegetarian curries, but gave up rice, bread and sweets. The weight melted off. Thomas sends me a graph tracking his blood sugar while on the diet \u2013 the line plummets vertically, like a bird falling out of the sky. His diabetes is now in remission. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge weight off my mind,\u201d he says. Not everyone finds it so easy. Ultra-low-calorie diets are tough, particularly if you struggle to find time to cook. Emma wants to lose weight, but it just feels impossible. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to make healthy choices a lot of the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI have four children who won\u2019t eat the same food, so I\u2019m running around after them, and then I\u2019m left to last, so I just grab a sandwich.\u201d She is not following a low-calorie regime, and worries about her long-term health. \u201cWhen I go to bed at night, I think: \u2018I must make this change tomorrow.\u2019\u201d She hopes to start the low-calorie diet when her youngest daughter starts nursery. \u201cThen I can focus on me a bit more. Because one of my worst fears is having a leg amputated, or going blind.\u201d Perrin has been trying to stick to a low-calorie diet, but finds it hard to unlearn the eating habits of a lifetime. \u201cI eat because of boredom,\u201d Perrin says. \u201cIt gives you something to do when you\u2019re watching the telly.\u201d Quitting sugar floored her. \u201cI felt awful.\u201d She has, though, lost half a stone so far, and is hoping to send her diabetes into remission. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard,\u201d she says. How to incentivise people to lose weight? \u201cIt\u2019s about education,\u201d says Riley. \u201cMaking sure people understand the risks, so they can take preventative steps like amending their diet and becoming more active, before it is too late.\u201d Riley welcomes the government\u2019s commitment to halving childhood obesity by 2030, and is supportive of the sugar tax. But we need public-health interventions on a broader scale if we are to halt the diabetes epidemic. Lean calls for root-and-branch reform of our national eating habits. \u201cWe need to go back to how our parents and grandparents ate. Whole grains, pulses, vegetables \u2013 and meat for special occasions.\u201d Being fat is stigmatised \u2013 and type 2 diabetes sufferers are often unfairly judged. \u201cTo a certain extent, I\u2019ve got the body I deserve,\u201d says Perrin. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten a lot of crap over the years. But it isn\u2019t purely self-inflicted.\u201d Emma doesn\u2019t tell most people about her diagnosis, because she finds it embarrassing. When she goes out for lunch with friends who know, she worries that they are watching what she eats. \u201cI think: \u2018Are they going to judge me for my choices?\u2019\u201d Her mother berates her too. \u201cShe has all the time in the world to go to the gym,\u201d Emma says. The public-health messaging around type 2 diabetes is tricky \u2013 you don\u2019t motivate people like Emma to make healthier choices by shaming them. But we must get it right because this is an unprecedented public-health emergency. Lean is hopeful that we will see the sort of radical consciousness-changing around obesity that we have witnessed with the climate emergency. \u201cPreventing diabetes must start among young people. We have Greta Thunberg out there showing that young people can grasp all sorts of things \u2026 We need to bring young people up to speed. Diabetes is a deadly, serious disease, and we all need to stop it.\u201d Thomas is evangelical about showing other people with diabetes that it can be reversed through diet. Unfortunately, he isn\u2019t always successful \u2013 his mother and brother back home in Chennai are pre-diabetic, but won\u2019t listen. \u201cThey think it\u2019s too hard,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cThey say: \u2018You\u2019ve got the will and determination, but we don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Halliday is also spreading the message in between his packed schedule (the former agoraphobic is currently rehearsing for an am-dram production of The Addams Family). \u201cI want to empower people to believe it can be done,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I was a hermit living in my own home. If I can do it, anyone can.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 October 2019 to clarify the distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The former is an autoimmune condition. Type 1 is not associated with lifestyle, whereas type 2 is.",

For that audience you have to push things further and it\u2019s ruder and I think publicists get really nervous.

I just feel that if standup comedy disappears, where do you go ... I don\u2019t know. Let me have a think about this. It does wind me up. <br>Graham: I\u2019m in two minds about it. On the one hand, I think it\u2019s annoying that you\u2019re being told what to say \u2026 But funny continues \u2013 you just have to be slightly cleverer about what you\u2019re funny about. When alternative comedy began, it was saying, OK, Bernard Manning\u2019s act: that doesn\u2019t exist any more.

I still find it funny, but not as funny as I did. Things shock me now that wouldn\u2019t have shocked me when I was 25. I\u2019m a bit like [sharp intake of breath] he said \u201ccunt\u201d \u2013 twice! Maybe I have become more sensitive.<br>I always think it\u2019s weird when people talk about jokes and what you can do, or \u201cyou can\u2019t say anything now\u201d. And it\u2019s like, the only people stopping you are your audience. They decide what\u2019s funny and what\u2019s not funny. There isn\u2019t some weird comedy police. If I came out in front of my audience on a Thursday night and did some of those jokes we did [on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/29/graham-norton-became-the-undisputed-talk-show-king\" title=\"\">So Graham Norton</a>], the audience would just look ashen. And they wouldn\u2019t like it. It is partly, I think, because of Twitter and things now, where there\u2019s so much bile and viciousness out there that people don\u2019t want that in their entertainment.</p> <p><strong>Did you see the online backlash against <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/29/rupauls-drag-race-uks-baga-chipz-reveals-fling-90s-heartthrob-kavana-10826801/\" title=\"\">drag queen Baga Chipz</a> when she was announced as a contestant on UK Drag Race? It was because of an old article in which she said it was OK for gay people to vote Tory in the 2017 general election. </strong><br>Alan: Well, that\u2019s her opinion, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s an opinion. It\u2019s dangerous when you start telling people they can\u2019t have an opinion on something. And, you know, you don\u2019t cancel someone, you engage with someone. That\u2019s the problem. I think that\u2019s why I was struggling with the cancelling thing. Because it doesn\u2019t actually cancel \u2013 if anything it gives people more column inches. Doesn\u2019t anyone make any mistakes any more?<br>Graham: Apparently, they do. <br>Alan: It sounds like I work at Hallmark, but every day is a journey and you get better and that\u2019s the whole point of life.<br>Graham: Try working at the BBC. Easy for you to say, Mr ITV over there. Going back to the comedy, I think there is something about drag that gives performers licence to do stuff. Every performer that gets on stage has a persona, you\u2019re never truly yourself \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter who you are. You\u2019re putting something on, but I think, because in drag you are hidden, you can say and do things and an audience will allow you to do them. Like [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/22/bianca-del-rio-review-startlingly-mean-drag-star-comedian\" title=\"\">US drag queen] Bianca Del Rio</a> does material that no one else is doing \u2013 Joan Rivers type stuff. A proper insult comic. And that isn\u2019t that popular right now. But she\u2019s getting away with it.</p> <p><strong>It does seem </strong><strong>that with drag queens the bar for what is deemed acceptable is slightly lower.</strong><br>Alan: Because you\u2019re otherworldly: your rules don\u2019t apply to this world.<br>Graham: You\u2019ve already broken so many rules just to get on stage. It gives you a freedom and there\u2019s something dangerous about drag still, and I enjoy that.</p> <p><strong>Do you think things are getting worse for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/homophobic-and-transphobic-hate-crimes-surge-in-england-and-wales\" title=\"\">LGBT people in Britain</a>?</strong><br>Graham: Well, they\u2019re certainly repetitive. Why does anyone study history? Why do we bother?<br>Alan: The one thing you do learn from history is that you don\u2019t learn from history. It\u2019s becoming a bit of a minefield \u2013 just the semantics and the language. I feel as if we can\u2019t really get to the problems, because we have to tiptoe through this minefield of language. It would be nice just to get it all out on the table and discuss, but I think sometimes social media can blur all that.<br>Graham: Twitter, I think, must destroy some young gays. If you stick your head above the parapet and you retweet the wrong thing, or you comment on the wrong thing, suddenly you must think the world is so ugly, and so horrible. And I think that\u2019s properly dangerous. Because when you\u2019re a kid, the one thing you don\u2019t know is that this is just going to blow over. And even though people are saying they want to rip your head off and shit down your throat, they\u2019re never going to say boo to you if they see you in the street.</p> <p><strong>Alan, I read somewhere that you live on a farm with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/24/julian-clary-family-values\" title=\"\">Julian Clary</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/13/paul-ogrady-lost-about-everybody-i-know-cilla-black-jackie-collins\" title=\"\">Paul O\u2019Grady</a>. Is that true? </strong><br>Alan: No! I mean it sounds like the most amazing sitcom, but yeah, it\u2019s been said that I live on a farm with Paul O\u2019Grady and Julian Clary, and I would love it to be true, but it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t know where that came from.<br>Graham: But you do farm, don\u2019t you? <br>Alan: Well, I just mince around in some wellies [on his husband, Paul\u2019s farm]. I am so crap down there, because it\u2019s all shit and death. You see an animal on it\u2019s side and you\u2019re like: \u201cPlease be a narcoleptic, please don\u2019t be dying, please be having a kip.\u201d I can\u2019t bear it.</p> <p><strong>So there\u2019s no chance of you doing a farming show on telly?</strong><br>Alan: No. Listen, I\u2019ve had the phone calls. I know how they want me \u2013 they want me pulling a cow\u2019s teat, screaming \u201cAh! Ah!\u201d [mimes milking a cow].

Something had happened in your life. You failed at something else. Or you were hiding from something or there was some story before you got to the moment where you were dressed as a woman, lip syncing. I think that\u2019s changed. There are now children growing up thinking: \u201cI want to be a drag queen.\u201d <br>Alan: It will never go away. I mean, listen, you know, in the Bible \u2013 obviously I haven\u2019t read it for ages \u2026<br>Graham: Well, we didn\u2019t expect this, did we! We did not see this coming. <br>Alan: Wasn\u2019t there something in the Bible about how [men] should never wear women\u2019s clothes or the other sex\u2019s clothes, what was that all about? There\u2019s something about transvestism and drag in the Bible, I swear it. So it\u2019s been around for ages. I think it will be around for ever because it is a state of mind. There\u2019s a male energy and a female energy and I think you get it in performers like Prince, Michael Jackson, George Michael, David Bowie \u2013 there is something magnetic in that fight between male and female going on before your eyes. And I feel in good drag you can\u2019t take your eyes off of it. <br>Graham: That is really true.<br>Alan: That\u2019s actually deep. But cut out the Bible bit. I think we all knew I was out of my depth. <br>Graham: I hope drag is here to stay because I really enjoy it. Instagram drag may go away \u2013 the idea of boys sitting in their bedrooms painting their faces. But actual drag performers \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s midnight ladies and gentlemen, please welcome \u2026\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s going to go on for ever.</p> <p><em>RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK starts on BBC Three on </em><em>3 October at 8pm and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nxl5q\" title=\"\">will be exclusively available on BBC iPlayer</a></em></p>",

Alan Carr: Before I started dressing up as women in sketches, I thought: \u201cI bet because I\u2019m not a looker as a man, I\u2019m one of those ones that, when you put on the make up, I am quite something \u2013 quite stunning.\u201d And no. It just doesn\u2019t translate. I\u2019ve seen the first episode of your show and it is a lot more messy and anarchic than the US version. Alan: Drag queens in the UK, they survive it all \u2013 there\u2019s a hen party, a stag party, people throwing beer bottles. They work not on their heels, but on their wits. Graham: Even the ones that aren\u2019t funny are funny. Suddenly, you realise how unfunny some of the American ones are. Do you think the UK version might get lost in translation? Graham: Funny is funny, I think. Alan: I sort of hope it does get a little bit lost. I had to go in and tell RuPaul who Kim Woodburn [the TV personality and cleaner] is. How can you explain to Americans who Kim Woodburn is? It\u2019s just nice, for once in my life, to not be the campest one in the room. Do you ever find that you check yourselves in public any more \u2013 that you worry about people recognising that you\u2019re gay? Alan: I give up with all that. I give up. Graham: But I understand it. I mean, sometimes you do, because if you feel like someone\u2019s gonna punch you, then yes, you do. Still, now, you know. It\u2019s funny when people talk about coming out, because you want to say to them: it never ends. You think you come out and that\u2019s the end of it. No. Because then it\u2019s the first nice day of the year and the cab driver says something about \u201cOh, I love the summer, you know, they\u2019ve all got their tits out,\u201d and you\u2019re like: is this a moment?

We\u2019re like Vin Diesel and Sylvester Stallone, compared with that. Camp is different things to different people. Did you ever watch Dynasty?

It gives you a freedom and there\u2019s something dangerous about drag still, and I enjoy that. Do you think things are getting worse for LGBT people in Britain? Graham: Well, they\u2019re certainly repetitive. Why does anyone study history? Why do we bother? Alan: The one thing you do learn from history is that you don\u2019t learn from history. It\u2019s becoming a bit of a minefield \u2013 just the semantics and the language. I feel as if we can\u2019t really get to the problems, because we have to tiptoe through this minefield of language. It would be nice just to get it all out on the table and discuss, but I think sometimes social media can blur all that. Graham: Twitter, I think, must destroy some young gays. If you stick your head above the parapet and you retweet the wrong thing, or you comment on the wrong thing, suddenly you must think the world is so ugly, and so horrible. And I think that\u2019s properly dangerous. Because when you\u2019re a kid, the one thing you don\u2019t know is that this is just going to blow over. And even though people are saying they want to rip your head off and shit down your throat, they\u2019re never going to say boo to you if they see you in the street. Alan, I read somewhere that you live on a farm with Julian Clary and Paul O\u2019Grady. Is that true? Alan: No! I mean it sounds like the most amazing sitcom, but yeah, it\u2019s been said that I live on a farm with Paul O\u2019Grady and Julian Clary, and I would love it to be true, but it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t know where that came from. Graham: But you do farm, don\u2019t you? Alan: Well, I just mince around in some wellies [on his husband, Paul\u2019s farm]. I am so crap down there, because it\u2019s all shit and death. You see an animal on it\u2019s side and you\u2019re like: \u201cPlease be a narcoleptic, please don\u2019t be dying, please be having a kip.\u201d I can\u2019t bear it. So there\u2019s no chance of you doing a farming show on telly? Alan: No. Listen, I\u2019ve had the phone calls. I know how they want me \u2013 they want me pulling a cow\u2019s teat, screaming \u201cAh! Ah!\u201d [mimes milking a cow]. They want another Rebecca Loos. So, just to bring it back to drag \u2026 Graham: Speaking of death and shit. Do you think drag is here to stay in mainstream culture or is it just having a moment? Graham: When Drag Race started, drag was nobody\u2019s first choice. Something had happened in your life. You failed at something else. Or you were hiding from something or there was some story before you got to the moment where you were dressed as a woman, lip syncing. I think that\u2019s changed. There are now children growing up thinking: \u201cI want to be a drag queen.\u201d Alan: It will never go away. I mean, listen, you know, in the Bible \u2013 obviously I haven\u2019t read it for ages \u2026 Graham: Well, we didn\u2019t expect this, did we! We did not see this coming. Alan: Wasn\u2019t there something in the Bible about how [men] should never wear women\u2019s clothes or the other sex\u2019s clothes, what was that all about? There\u2019s something about transvestism and drag in the Bible, I swear it. So it\u2019s been around for ages. I think it will be around for ever because it is a state of mind. There\u2019s a male energy and a female energy and I think you get it in performers like Prince, Michael Jackson, George Michael, David Bowie \u2013 there is something magnetic in that fight between male and female going on before your eyes. And I feel in good drag you can\u2019t take your eyes off of it. Graham: That is really true. Alan: That\u2019s actually deep. But cut out the Bible bit. I think we all knew I was out of my depth. Graham: I hope drag is here to stay because I really enjoy it. Instagram drag may go away \u2013 the idea of boys sitting in their bedrooms painting their faces. But actual drag performers \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s midnight ladies and gentlemen, please welcome \u2026\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s going to go on for ever.

      "bodyText": "Michael Cheika said that as a former player he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d at the confusion the crackdown on high tackles is causing in the World Cup after another match was held up by constant reviews on the big screen. Australia\u2019s head coach was speaking after his side\u2019s 29-25 defeat by Wales, which leaves them on course for the more difficult route to the final with England and New Zealand likely to stand in their way. The Australia wing Reece Hodge was banned for three weeks after being cited for a dangerous tackle on Peceli Yato the previous week which left the Fiji flanker concussed, but when Wales\u2019s replacement fly\u2011half Rhys Patchell made a similar challenge on Samu Kerevi here it was the Australia centre who was the subject of the review and penalised for going into the challenge with a raised forearm, although the crowd did not know which of the two was being scrutinised. \u201cIt was pretty funny because I thought I had seen that tackle before, it could have been Reece Hodge, I am not sure,\u201d said Cheika, who in the build-up to the match had berated World Rugby for taking action against his wing and shortly before the governing body had admitted that its officials had not performed to an acceptable level during the opening round of World Cup matches . \u201cWhen our guy makes that tackle and has the high tackle framework in his head, he gets suspended.

      "bodyText": "TV-themed festivals, events and experiences are booming as fans of hit shows such as Friends, Peaky Blinders and Stranger Things take their living room love affair into the real world. Earlier this month, fans of Peaky Blinders were treated to the hit BBC show\u2019s first ever official festival, Primark recently opened a Friends-themed cafe in Manchester and later this year Netflix\u2019s Stranger Things gets the full Secret Cinema experiential treatment. The extension of the likes of popular TV brands to events, experiences and promotions has spawned a new market targeting so-called \u201ckidults\u201d, who are willing to shell out serious cash for experiences as varied as MasterChef At Sea, where guests compete in a cooking competition against each other in the style of the TV show while also enjoying a cruise, to a Peaky Blinders escape room. Anna Knight, vice-president of licensing at Informa Markets, says: \u201cWhat we are living in right now is an experience economy. Experiences are what people want to buy now. These pop-ups and experiences tap into a cult level following by true fans spending money at a high level. You\u2019re not just looking at a \u00a310 T-shirt.\u201d Take the example of Secret Cinema\u2019s Stranger Things event, which kicks off from 13 November, where regular tickets cost about \u00a350. Devotees of the science fiction show set in 1980s Hawkins, Indiana, are promised \u201ca living, breathing story to experience your favourite moments from the Netflix original series\u201d. Details are understandably scarce, but it takes place at a secret London location and ticket holders will experience unseen storylines and characters from the show. They will also be told to stick to a dress code and what accessories to bring, for a three-hour \u201cother-worldly cinematic experience\u201d. Demand can be high. Secret Cinema took \u00a38m in ticket sales from more than 120,000 fans wanting a slice of the James Bond lifestyle during the four month run of its Casino Royale experience. \u201cWe spend $10m [\u00a38.14m] on a show now,\u201d says Max Alexander, chief executive of Secret Cinema. \u201cFor years there have been things like ComicCon but more recently there has been been a real proliferation [of experiences and events].

Turning back to me, the 33-year-old playwright shares this advice for anyone interested in writing about girls and women: \u201cMake it soulful. And big. Take it seriously. Don\u2019t make it cute.\u201d In plays such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/05/dance-nation-review-clare-barron-almeida-london\">Dance Nation</a>, You Got Older, I\u2019ll Never Love Again and Dirty Crusty, which is about to get its world premiere in Britain, Barron shows what it is like to live in an ungovernable (usually female) body with ungovernable (usually female) emotions. Beauty and cruelty collide, as do desire and pain.</p> <p>Wearing a vintage dress, her hair pulled back into a frisking ponytail, Barron is small, slender and doe-eyed. Which some might call cute. Her looks invite condescension, such as, for example that time at an awards ceremony when a critic initially mistook her for an actor and then asked her if she had written her nominated play all by herself. She has also wondered if some of her early success is down to this certain camera-readiness. Dance Nation won a Relentless award in 2015 and is currently a Pulitzer prize finalist. There have been TV development deals, too. (She arrived for pitch meetings waifish after being ill \u201cwearing really slutty clothes, kind of on purpose, almost to troll the whole thing\u201d.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a1e55607b4c923341bbdcab421fb85970e2570b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a1e55607b4c923341bbdcab421fb85970e2570b/0_0_4899_3266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karla Crome (centre) in the Pulitzer-nominated Dance Nation at the Almeida, London, in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beauty and cruelty collide \u2026 Karla Crome (centre) in the Pulitzer-nominated Dance Nation at the Almeida, London, in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSometimes it holds you back,\u201d she says, \u201cand other times the very thing that is being fetishised or commodified is getting you an opportunity. And then it becomes scary to age. Like, do I only have a career because I was a young female writer and that was hip? Or do people actually take my work seriously?\u201d</p> <p>The work tells women\u2019s stories, Barron says, because she is a woman. And it concentrates on bodies and on sex because she grew up in a conservative Christian community in Washington state and has tasked herself with undoing the shame she learned there. \u201cOur bodies are wild and our sexuality is wild,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s weird that we don\u2019t talk more openly about it.\u201d Barron does \u2013 speaking blithely about blowjobs and dating apps geared toward kink.</p> <p>The emotions in her work are wild, too. \u201cI recently got diagnosed as bipolar,\u201d she says. \u201cSo part of me is, like, maybe I just have outsized emotions and that\u2019s why I\u2019m interested in this.\u201d She is taking medication, which she thinks is affecting her memory. \u201cIt\u2019s not as good as it used to be,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Is this worth it?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Dirty Crusty is about a directionless young woman with an eccentric approach to personal hygiene</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bodies and emotions smash together in Dirty Crusty, an early play. She wrote it quickly, seven years ago, for Youngblood, a prestigious early-career writers group in Manhattan. She and her boyfriend had started seeing other people (\u201cSo I was having all this crazy sex with older men\u201d) and two close friends had died suddenly. The play became a channel for desire and grief. She also thought she might play the lead role, Jeanine.</p> <p>A directionless young woman with an eccentric approach to personal hygiene, Jeanine falls into relationships with Victor, a mask-maker, and Synda, a former ballerina. Dreamlike and hyperreal, Dirty Crusty, like all Barron\u2019s plays, is written with a kind of radical intimacy and explores the limits of what a body can want and take and do. Here\u2019s one line: \u201cNow that I\u2019ve remembered my body, I\u2019m afraid to be alone with it.\u201d</p> <p>The 26-year-old body that wrote Dirty Crusty doesn\u2019t feel like Barron\u2019s own any more and revisiting it, she says, is \u201cdeeply weird\u201d. Still, she doesn\u2019t want to revise it. \u201cI want to respect that 26-year-old person. I don\u2019t want to get in there and try to update it to my current self.\u201d That self, by the way, is \u201cextremely single\u201d and had a crazy summer of dating four or five people at the same time. \u201cThere\u2019s so much carnage in dating,\u201d she says, philosophically.</p> <p>Barron doesn\u2019t know how a London audience will respond to the play, but she doesn\u2019t like to prescribe a certain response. \u201cI get annoyed with plays where they\u2019re trying to get me to feel something,\u201d she says. \u201cMy favourite theatre experience is an experience where some people are laughing \u2013 and some are crying.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Dirty Crusty is at the <a href=\"https://theyardtheatre.co.uk/theatre/events/dirty-crusty/\">Yard theatre, London</a>, 24 October-30 November.</p></li> </ul>",

Don\u2019t make it cute.\u201d In plays such as Dance Nation, You Got Older, I\u2019ll Never Love Again and Dirty Crusty, which is about to get its world premiere in Britain, Barron shows what it is like to live in an ungovernable (usually female) body with ungovernable (usually female) emotions. Beauty and cruelty collide, as do desire and pain. Wearing a vintage dress, her hair pulled back into a frisking ponytail, Barron is small, slender and doe-eyed. Which some might call cute. Her looks invite condescension, such as, for example that time at an awards ceremony when a critic initially mistook her for an actor and then asked her if she had written her nominated play all by herself. She has also wondered if some of her early success is down to this certain camera-readiness. Dance Nation won a Relentless award in 2015 and is currently a Pulitzer prize finalist. There have been TV development deals, too. (She arrived for pitch meetings waifish after being ill \u201cwearing really slutty clothes, kind of on purpose, almost to troll the whole thing\u201d.) \u201cSometimes it holds you back,\u201d she says, \u201cand other times the very thing that is being fetishised or commodified is getting you an opportunity. And then it becomes scary to age. Like, do I only have a career because I was a young female writer and that was hip? Or do people actually take my work seriously?\u201d The work tells women\u2019s stories, Barron says, because she is a woman. And it concentrates on bodies and on sex because she grew up in a conservative Christian community in Washington state and has tasked herself with undoing the shame she learned there. \u201cOur bodies are wild and our sexuality is wild,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s weird that we don\u2019t talk more openly about it.\u201d Barron does \u2013 speaking blithely about blowjobs and dating apps geared toward kink. The emotions in her work are wild, too. \u201cI recently got diagnosed as bipolar,\u201d she says. \u201cSo part of me is, like, maybe I just have outsized emotions and that\u2019s why I\u2019m interested in this.\u201d She is taking medication, which she thinks is affecting her memory. \u201cIt\u2019s not as good as it used to be,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Is this worth it?\u2019\u201d Bodies and emotions smash together in Dirty Crusty, an early play. She wrote it quickly, seven years ago, for Youngblood, a prestigious early-career writers group in Manhattan. She and her boyfriend had started seeing other people (\u201cSo I was having all this crazy sex with older men\u201d) and two close friends had died suddenly. The play became a channel for desire and grief. She also thought she might play the lead role, Jeanine. A directionless young woman with an eccentric approach to personal hygiene, Jeanine falls into relationships with Victor, a mask-maker, and Synda, a former ballerina. Dreamlike and hyperreal, Dirty Crusty, like all Barron\u2019s plays, is written with a kind of radical intimacy and explores the limits of what a body can want and take and do. Here\u2019s one line: \u201cNow that I\u2019ve remembered my body, I\u2019m afraid to be alone with it.\u201d The 26-year-old body that wrote Dirty Crusty doesn\u2019t feel like Barron\u2019s own any more and revisiting it, she says, is \u201cdeeply weird\u201d. Still, she doesn\u2019t want to revise it. \u201cI want to respect that 26-year-old person. I don\u2019t want to get in there and try to update it to my current self.\u201d That self, by the way, is \u201cextremely single\u201d and had a crazy summer of dating four or five people at the same time. \u201cThere\u2019s so much carnage in dating,\u201d she says, philosophically. Barron doesn\u2019t know how a London audience will respond to the play, but she doesn\u2019t like to prescribe a certain response. \u201cI get annoyed with plays where they\u2019re trying to get me to feel something,\u201d she says. \u201cMy favourite theatre experience is an experience where some people are laughing \u2013 and some are crying.\u201d Dirty Crusty is at the Yard theatre, London, 24 October-30 November.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company. Read Giles Richards\u2019s race report: Vettel is asked if Ferrari are guilty of overcomplicating the team strategy. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what happened,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had an agreement. I spoke with Charles [Leclerc] in particular before the race, I thought it was quite clear but maybe I missed something. We wanted to have the cars one and two. It\u2019s not the result we wanted. We talked about a strategy to find a way past Lewis. I think we did just race, until the pit stop in a way. Up to that point, that\u2019s what we did. It\u2019s bitter, because this year has been tough. I was really on top of it, finding the rhythm and fastest up until the stop. But it was only a half-job.\u201d A peek at the drivers\u2019 championship: Hamilton 322 Bottas 249 Leclerc 215 Verstappen 212 Vettel 194 Up on the podium, Lewis Hamilton is all smiles. That feels a significant win, even if things fell nicely for them after Ferrari seemed to shoot themselves in the foot, ultimately paying the price for squabbling over race tactics. \u201cThey [Mercedes] have been pushing forwards and always trying to be innovative and just never giving up. It makes me feel inspired and it\u2019s incredible to have this result today. Keeping up with [Ferrari] was a hard task\u201d . Charles Leclerc is asked whether he has lost any faith in Ferrari given how Sebastian Vettel seemed to ignore the plan in Sochi. \u201cI will always trust the team but the tactic was me giving the slipstream to be one-two at the end of the straight, which happened, but then I don\u2019t know ... I need to speak with the team to know better the situation,\u201d says the Mon\u00e9gasque driver. Has Hamilton now got his eyes set on bagging a sixth drivers\u2019 championship? His response is very cliche, very sensible. \u201cI try not to think too much about the championship, it\u2019s one race, one step at a time,\u201d he says. \u201cOne foot in front of the other \u2013 we don\u2019t want to stumble. But of course we have to keep putting in performances like this. The team back in Stuttgart will be really happy.\u201d \u201cGet in there Lewis, what a race, awesome drive!\u201d Mercedes bellow down the team radio. \u201cP1, P2, silver arrows.\u201d Hamilton is, it is safe to say, over the moon with that, as he storms to victory. \u201cWhat a great effort, incredible effort guys,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we needed, we never give up.\u201d Hamilton is ecstatic, jumping into his team of engineers at Parc ferm\u00e9. That\u2019s a massive leap towards a sixth drivers\u2019 championship. Leclerc high-fives the Ferrari clan \u2013 but they made a mess of that race, typified by Vettel\u2019s premature exit. Hamilton says: \u201cFirstly, an incredible job by all of the guys this weekend, never giving up. We keep pushing.\u201d It has not been without drama \u2013 but a rather straightforward finish for Lewis Hamilton, who earns his ninth win this year! A Mercedes one-two, with Bottas taking second ahead of Charles Leclerc. Toto Wolff, as he was before the race, is all smiles. Job done. Lap 53/53: Final lap! Hamilton leads by 4.6secs! Lap 52/53: Lewis Hamilton leads Bottas by 4.9secs. He\u2019s going to do it, isn\u2019t he? Charles Leclerc trails Bottas by 1.6secs. Lap 51/53: A timely fastest lap by Hamilton, who racks up a 1.35.761. That comes seconds after Leclerc says he will try and go one better and nab the fastest lap \u2013 if nothing else \u2013 in Sochi. He seems resigned to a third-placed finish. Lap 50/53: Barring disaster, Hamilton will win his ninth race this year! And, better still for Mercedes, they are primed for a one-two with Leclerc close to giving up the ghost in his chase on a stubborn Valtteri Bottas. Lap 49/53: Hamilton leads Bottas by 4.8secs. Lap 48/53: Five to go! A disappointing end to a decent day\u2019s racing for Kevin Magnussen, with the Haas slapped with a five-second penalty for leaving the track at turn two. He\u2019s eighth, but that punishment would take him out of the points. Lap 47/53: Ferrari are revving up Leclerc, who says he\u2019s giving everything he\u2019s got to try and close the gap to Bottas. \u201cYou can do this Nico, you can do this,\u201d is the motivation down the team radio for H\u00fclkenberg. But Hamilton is close to putting his feet up. Hamilton leads Bottas by more than five seconds now ... Lap 45/53: Is Ferrari\u2019s three-race winning run about to come to an abrupt end in Sochi? Lewis Hamilton looks very comfortable out in front. He leads his Mercedes colleague Valtteri Bottas by 4.3secs. Then there\u2019s Leclerc. Next up is the Japan GP on 13 October. Ferrari haven\u2019t won there since Michael Schumacher did in 2004. Lap 44/53: Magnussen goes wide \u2013 and Sergio P\u00e9rez bypasses the Haas. It is turning into a decent afternoon for Racing Point, with Lance Stroll 11th and tussling with H\u00fclkenberg for 10th. Plenty of life left in that race. Lap 43/53: Hamilton sets another fastest lap, whizzing round in 1.36.467. An eventful race is in danger of drawing to a relatively routine finish, unless Leclerc can ramp things up on Bottas. Here\u2019s how we stand with 10 laps to go: 1 Hamilton 2 Bottas + 4.1secs 3 Leclerc + 1.18secs 4 Verstappen + 3.9secs 5 Sainz + 16secs 6 Albon +4secs 7 Magnussen + 2secs Lap 42/53: Hamilton is not hanging around. Asked to pick up the pace, he puts his foot down and accelerates to 4.04secs away from Bottas. Breathing space. Leclerc is just over one second behind Bottas, who is in for a busy finish. Lap 40/53: Hamilton leads Bottas by 3.5secs. Hamilton is hunting out race win No 82 and chasing his ninth win of the year. Mercedes let Hamilton know Bottas is under pressure, so maybe they want him to extend his lead and stretch things. Lap 39/53: Are Mercedes heading for an unlikely one-two? Hamilton leads Valtteri Bottas by 3.03secs, and then there\u2019s Charles Leclerc, determined to usurp the Mercedes into second. Verstappen trails Leclerc by 2.6secs. The Red Bull could yet finish on the podium. Bottas acknowledges he\u2019s under the cosh. Lap 38/53: Hamilton is supercharged. He racks up a 1.36.639. Lap 37/53: Hamilton has just set a new fastest lap of 1.37.118. The Mercedes is very much in the box seat after struggling to match Ferrari\u2019s pace for so long. Beyond the front, Alexander Albon is up to seventh having overtaken Lando Norris and Sergio P\u00e9rez. Verstappen, meanwhile, is riding high in fourth after starting from ninth. This is looking like a much better day than Red Bull anticipated. Kevin Magnussen is next in Albon\u2019s sights. Lap 35/53: Hamilton leads Bottas by 1.23secs. A meaningless but encouraging stat for Mercedes: Hamilton has never failed to take victory at Sochi after taking the lead at the Russia GP, winning here in 2014, 2015 and 2018 ... Lap 33/53: The field compresses as the safety car departs \u2013 but Hamilton remains out in front. Leclerc is piling the pressure on Bottas. Verstappen locks up going into the final turn but the Red Bull gets away with it. Sainz, in fifth, bares his teeth. A reminder that Grosjean, Kubica, Russell, Ricciardo and Vettel are out. Lap 32/53: \u201cSo Ferrari are still behind us?\u201d asks Hamilton. Believe it or not, yep. Valtteri Bottas is directly behind him, trailing by 1.5secs and then there is Charles Leclerc, who started on pole but now finds himself in a third. Lap 31/53: Leclerc pits again ... the Ferrari goes on to a younger tyre, identical to those Lewis Hamilton is whizzing round on. Meanwhile, Robert Kubica has also been retired, shortly after a brake failure ended Russell\u2019s race. Lap 30/53: George Russell\u2019s race is also run \u2013 and we have yellow flags and a safety car out on track, which will bunch up the pack ever so slightly. A torrid afternoon in Sochi for Sebastian Vettel, whose race started so promisingly. He jumped into the lead in the first corner of the race and was cruising until an engine issue flared up seconds after heading into the pits ... Lap 29/53: Vettel\u2019s retirement and the arrival of the virtual safety car has given Mercedes a big foot-up. Lewis Hamilton is the new race leader, eight seconds or so in front of Charles Leclerc. Then there\u2019s Bottas in third. What a mess for Ferrari. This certainly wasn\u2019t the Plan C they eventually moved on to. Lap 28/53: Sebastian Vettel is out of the Russia GP!! ... you couldn\u2019t make it up! Channelling his inner John McEnroe, Vettel fumes down the team radio: \u201cYou cannot be serious.\u201d The German\u2019s first DNF of the season. Ferrari engineers bow their head in shame. Vettel must be absolutely livid. Things were rosy but with Ferrari intent on restoring Leclerc ahead of Vettel, they have cocked things up. Vettel had a kinetic engine problem. A sucker-punch for Ferrari. Lap 27/53: \u201cWe need you to push, push this lap,\u201d Leclerc is told down the Ferrari radio. And he has given it a bit of oomph, so much so that Leclerc jumps into third ahead of Sebastian Vettel. The team radio is going to make wonderful listening in the next few minutes ... Lap 26/53: Vettel pits \u2013 and Hamilton takes over the lead! Daniel Ricciardo\u2019s race is over, confirm Renault. He ultimately sustained too much damage in that first-lap collision with Grosjean. He trudges off into the pits and that\u2019s that. His race is run. Lap 25/53: Vettel is running into a bit of traffic, while Leclerc sets a new fastest lap with those fresh new mediums on. As for Hamilton, the message from Mercedes is clear. \u201cLewis get your head down, we are going to be extending.\u201d Hamilton\u2019s riposte? \u201cMy head is down, the tyres are good.\u201d Lap 24/53: Ferrari are primed for Vettel\u2019s arrival in the pits. Lap 23/53: Twenty-three laps in, there is little evidence of any of these bizarre pre-planned Ferrari tactics are working. And certainly not in Charles Leclerc\u2019s favour, even if the Ferrari will be confident of catching third-placed Bottas. Leclerc only went two-tenths quicker through the middle sector than Vettel, who, fingers in his ears, continues to rip it up out in front. Lap 22/53: Vettel stays out and Leclerc pits ... Vettel effectively storms off into the sunset as medium-compound tyres go on to the Ferrari. It\u2019s a bit of a sluggish stop and Hamilton zooms into second. Hammer time. Leclerc comes out into fourth. Lap 21/53: Vettel leads Leclerc by 4.4secs. Meanwhile, Nico H\u00fclkenberg speeds in front of Giovinazzi and into 16th. Lap 19/53: Leclerc is struggling to get anywhere near Vettel. He trails his Ferrari team-mate by more than four seconds, despite being told to push. \u201cThere is something definitely wrong with the brakes,\u201d says 12th-placed Albon down the team radio. Nico H\u00fclkenberg is down in 17th after a sluggish pit. Lap 17/53: Mercedes tell Lewis Hamilton \u201ctarget plus 15\u201d \u2013 seemingly wanting him to jet round on these mediums for at least another 15 laps\u2019 time. They want to leave it as late as possible before switching to softs. Hamilton believes his tyres are already suffering from degradation, a few blisters and such. Lap 16/53: \u201cAnd you can push now,\u201d Ferrari tell Leclerc, as Vettel racks up another lightning lap. But how can Leclerc get close to him? Leclerc is 4secs behind the race leader, who is enjoying himself out in front. We\u2019re in for a fascinating few laps. Hamilton is third, 7secs behind Leclerc. Infighting threatens to overshadow this race \u2013 but Ferrari are in the driving seat either way. Lap 15/53: \u201cThese guys have some serious pace,\u201d Hamilton says of the Ferraris in front him. He trails second-placed Leclerc by 3.6secs. But the race leader Vettel is really motoring, racking up fastest laps and sectors for fun. His tailor-made strategy seems to be leave Leclerc for dead and then it will be nigh-on impossible for him to trade places with his team-mate anyway. Smooth. Lap 14/53: Verstappen has already clambered up to sixth from ninth \u2013 and now the Red Bull has Carlos Sainz in his sights. Leclerc must be close to imploding. \u201cI completely understand, the only thing is and I respect it but I gave him [Vettel] the slipstream no problems and then I try and to push at the beginning of the race,\u201d Leclerc says.\u201d No problems. Another situation.\u201d No problems, eh? Lap 13/53: Charles Leclerc was supposed to be leading now but Ferrari rowed back on their original plan and Vettel, who has just set yet another fastest lap, is 3.5secs to the good out in front. Hamilton trails Leclerc by 3.3secs. Lap 11/53: Pace is certainly not a problem for Vettel, who sets a new fastest lap of 1.38min. Exhilarating speed for the Ferrari. Hamilton and Bottas, on the medium tyres, are lagging behind. Lap 10/53: \u201cWe are looking to Plan C,\u201d says Ferrari down the team radio. Plan A went out of the window and Plan B has seemingly been abandoned. They are making this up as they go along. Charles Leclerc sounds pretty fed up stating he respects the situation. His face must be a picture. Vettel is whizzing round Sochi, setting a new fastest lap of 1.39.016. The next message from Ferrari? \u201cCharles, we will do the swap a bit later on, Lewis is a bit close, just focus on your race ...\u201d Lap 9/53: Lovely, Vettel sets a new fastest lap. He\u2019s not letting up, with Leclerc almost 2secs behind his Ferrari team-mate. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, meanwhile, has a drive-through penalty for that false start on the grid at the race start. Lap 8/53: Leclerc and Vettel are having a ding-dong down the team radio. The German seems growingly reluctant to swap places with his Ferrari team-mate, while Leclerc says he has abided instructions without the favour being returned. He seems pretty up tight. It will be interesting how this saga plays out. And down in the battle for seventh, Max Verstappen edges past Sergio P\u00e9rez. Lap 7/53: Bottas zooms beyond Sainz to retake fourth. Lap 6/53: \u201cSebastian will let you by next lap,\u201d say Ferrari down the team radio to Leclerc. Very interesting. Early tactics from Ferrari. Vettel appears pretty happy with that but seems to want a couple of laps. Meanwhile, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen is under investigation, seemingly for that jump start on the grid, which will likely result in a penalty. Lap 5/53: Vettel leads Leclerc by 1sec. Lap 4/53: We\u2019re back racing, with the safety car trotting off the track. Vettel leads his Ferrari colleague Leclerc, with Hamilton in third. Renault are relatively happy that Ricciardo got off scot-free \u2013 a puncture aside \u2013 from that first-lap clash with Grosjean. Meanwhile, a new nose goes on for Giovinazzi\u2019s Alfa Romeo. Leclerc is certainly sticking close to Vettel, who is going at it full throttle. Ferrari inform Leclerc they are planning a swap later on. Lap 3/53: A spectacular launch by Vettel helps the Ferrari fly to the front of the pack at his team-mate Leclerc\u2019s expense. That was exactly what the 21-year-old will have feared. Still, it\u2019s a Ferrari one-two. Meanwhile, a jump start Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen on his 307th race start. Replays show Giovinazzi was involved in that collision between Ricciardo and Grosjean. Three into one doesn\u2019t go and it\u2019s Grosjean that comes off the worst. New tyres on for Ricciardo. Lap 2/53: Well, well, well! We have a safety car out on track. Grosjean tangled with Ricciardo, who heads for the pits to sort out that puncture. A lively start in Sochi. \u201cEveryone OK?\u201d asks third-placed Hamilton, before being informed that it is Grosjean whose race has ended prematurely. The sorry Haas is carried away. Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, appears all smiles before they zoom off the grid \u2013 but it is Ferrari that get a brilliant start, with Sebastian Vettel flying past Lewis Hamilton and taking the lead into the first corner. Charles Leclerc drops down to second. A dream start for Ferrari. Sainz is up to fourth. Meanwhile, a puncture for Daniel Ricciardo and Romain Grosjean is out. We are a formation lap away from the off! ... Max Verstappen is in the mood for overtaking. \u201cThe faster the better, of course in a clean way, but after that we just have to do our own race and see how competitive we are against the cars ahead,\u201d the Red Bull says. Valtteri Bottas says start on the medium tyres could help Mercedes get on to the podium. \u201cIt is a bit warmer than expected so hopefully Ferrari will struggle with the soft tyres.\u201d The sun is shining Sochi. It is around 22C, nearer 34C out on the track. Down on the grid, Christian Horner, the Red Bull chief, says: \u201cWe have got to get a good start. You can overtake here, the two DRS straights are powerful so were going to try and get on the back of the Ferraris and Mercedes as quick as we can.\u201d As for a difficult weekend for Albon, who starts from the pits, he says: \u201cForget yesterday, today is a new day. I still think he can be top six by the end of the day.\u201d Max Verstappen begins from ninth after a penalty. This a landmark race for R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. This is his 307th race start, which lifts him up to third in the all-time standings, one ahead of Michael Schumacher and behind only Fernando Alonso and Rubens Barrichello. The Alfa Romeo begins down in 15th in Sochi. \u201cWe\u2019ve had meetings about next year and I think there are good things coming,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll keep improving. We have a great group of people and we\u2019re working well.\u201d 1 Leclerc 2 Hamilton 3 Vettel 4 Bottas 5 Sainz 6 H\u00fclkenberg 7 Norris 8 Grosjean 9 Verstappen 10 Ricciardo 11 P\u00e9rez 12 Giovinazzi 13 Magnussen 14 Stroll 15 R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen 16 Gasly 17 Russell 18 Kubica 19 Kvyat 20 Albon* *Albon will start from the pit lane owing to a change of floor It is four poles on the bounce for Charles Leclerc.

Japan insists that all compensation claims from the war have been settled, but how would you feel if, say, your grandfather was a forced wartime labourer?</p> <p>\u201cI have more Japanese friends than Korean ones here, but we avoid talking about politics because we know we would go round in circles.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/24/south-korean-petrol-stations-refuse-to-fill-up-japanese-cars-amid-growing-boycott\">Earlier this year</a>, Japan placed restrictions on exports of semiconductor materials that are considered vital to South Korea\u2019s tech industry and followed up by ending South Korea\u2019s fast-track export status.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"215c24635d1dc08878c06cfd99b7287ecea4d8cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/215c24635d1dc08878c06cfd99b7287ecea4d8cf/0_887_2141_2332/918.jpg\" alt=\"A shop in Shin-\u014ckubo, Tokyo\" width=\"918\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Business owners in Shin-\u014ckubo are concerned about the fallout from the dispute between Japan and South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin McCurry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The move prompted anger in South Korea, where many still resent Japan\u2019s colonial rule of the peninsula from 1910 to 1945. The government saw the measure as retaliation for the court rulings against Japanese firms, and promptly removed Japan from its own \u201cwhite list\u201d of trading partners that receive preferential treatment.</p> <p>However, some shop owners said their businesses were weathering the diplomatic storm. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t really affected us, but that\u2019s probably because young people are less interested in politics,\u201d says Choi Dong-han, whose store sells K-pop memorabilia.</p> <p>Young Japanese devotees of South Korea\u2019s most successful cultural export still flock here to buy posters, DVDs and miniature figures of BTS, Tohoshinki and Big Bang, added Choi, who moved to Tokyo from South Korea two decades ago. \u201cBut I hope Japan and South Korea can sort out their differences. We\u2019re neighbours, so we have to get along.\u201d</p> <p>Relations, however, are far from neighbourly.

Experts have warned the move could harm the countries\u2019 ability to counter North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile and nuclear threat, while the US has put pressure on Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to drag their countries back from the brink of a long and damaging diplomatic estrangement.</p> <p>Media in both countries have been accused of peddling cultural stereotypes and whipping up nationalist sentiment. Some South Koreans have responded to calls to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/south-korea-boycott-japanese-goods-beer-car-sales\">boycott Japanese products</a>, including cosmetics, beer and clothes, while the number of South Koreans visiting Japan in August was 48% down on the same month last year.</p> <p>In a recent editorial, the left-leaning Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun accused other sections of the Japanese media of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201909170036.html\">trying to stir up hatred towards South Korea</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The paper reserved most scorn for the Shukan Post weekly magazine, which ran a series titled \u201cGoodbye to our annoying neighbour: Why we don\u2019t need South Korea\u201d.

After South Korean courts ordered Japanese companies to compensate the workers last year, the spat intensified and has now spread to trade, security cooperation, tourism and even preparations for next summer\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo. \u201cThe number of customers has dropped by about half in recent months,\u201d said the owner of a shop selling Korean cosmetics, who asked not to be named. \u201cYoung women still shop here, but older people just glance inside and walk on. It never used to be like this.\u201d The woman, who has run her shop for more than 20 years, said the country of her birth and the one she now calls home were at risk of becoming permanent adversaries. \u201cThey are poles apart. Japan insists that all compensation claims from the war have been settled, but how would you feel if, say, your grandfather was a forced wartime labourer? \u201cI have more Japanese friends than Korean ones here, but we avoid talking about politics because we know we would go round in circles.\u201d Earlier this year, Japan placed restrictions on exports of semiconductor materials that are considered vital to South Korea\u2019s tech industry and followed up by ending South Korea\u2019s fast-track export status. The move prompted anger in South Korea, where many still resent Japan\u2019s colonial rule of the peninsula from 1910 to 1945. The government saw the measure as retaliation for the court rulings against Japanese firms, and promptly removed Japan from its own \u201cwhite list\u201d of trading partners that receive preferential treatment. However, some shop owners said their businesses were weathering the diplomatic storm. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t really affected us, but that\u2019s probably because young people are less interested in politics,\u201d says Choi Dong-han, whose store sells K-pop memorabilia. Young Japanese devotees of South Korea\u2019s most successful cultural export still flock here to buy posters, DVDs and miniature figures of BTS, Tohoshinki and Big Bang, added Choi, who moved to Tokyo from South Korea two decades ago. \u201cBut I hope Japan and South Korea can sort out their differences. We\u2019re neighbours, so we have to get along.\u201d Relations, however, are far from neighbourly. Seoul has called on the International Olympic Committee to ban Japan\u2019s rising-sun flag \u2013 seen by some Koreans as a symbol of Japanese militarism \u2013 from next year\u2019s Summer Games in Tokyo. A recent poll found that South Koreans trust North Korea more than they do Japan. Late last month, South Korea scrapped an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan. Experts have warned the move could harm the countries\u2019 ability to counter North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile and nuclear threat, while the US has put pressure on Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to drag their countries back from the brink of a long and damaging diplomatic estrangement. Media in both countries have been accused of peddling cultural stereotypes and whipping up nationalist sentiment. Some South Koreans have responded to calls to boycott Japanese products, including cosmetics, beer and clothes, while the number of South Koreans visiting Japan in August was 48% down on the same month last year. In a recent editorial, the left-leaning Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun accused other sections of the Japanese media of \u201ctrying to stir up hatred towards South Korea\u201d. The paper reserved most scorn for the Shukan Post weekly magazine, which ran a series titled \u201cGoodbye to our annoying neighbour: Why we don\u2019t need South Korea\u201d. It also published an article citing academic research claiming that Koreans are pathologically incapable of controlling their emotions \u2013 an anti-Korean trope among the Japanese right. While North Korean missile tests have in the past prompted ugly street protests by rightwing extremists against Japan\u2019s Korean community, locals say this has not been the case during the most recent row, thanks in part to a controversial 2016 law aimed at curbing hate speech. \u201cWe are ordinary people trying to make a life here in Japan,\u201d said Yuh Keun-ie, president of the central headquarters of the Korean Residents Union in Japan, an organisation that represents about two-thirds of the 610,000 Korean residents in Japan who have not become naturalised Japanese citizens. Many of the rest belong to Chongryon, an association of Korean residents sympathetic to North Korea. \u201cBut whenever relations between Japan and Korea worsen, we receive threats, including towards our children and grandchildren.\u201d Yuh, who has seven grandchildren, two of whom have taken Japanese citizenship, added: \u201cWe are not interested in politics. All we care about is our livelihoods \u2013 that with hard work, talent and a bit of luck we can lead comfortable lives and contribute to the local community.\u201d",

Frail of body but still sharp of mind, the 87-year-old architect was something of a countercultural guru by this stage, thanks to his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/spaceshipearth\">spaceship Earth</a>\u201d philosophy and his forward-looking designs, not least the dome.</p> \n<p>Lightweight, efficient, simple to construct and futuristic, domes became a hippy cliche in the 70s, but the New Alchemists\u2019 dome was a little different. Designed by Fuller\u2019s disciple <a href=\"https://archpaper.com/2018/03/geodesic-dome-pioneer-jay-baldwin-passes-away-85/\">Jay Baldwin</a>, it was the first \u201cpillow dome\u201d: made of triangular panels of transparent plastic inflated with argon gas, which improved its insulation properties (the same technology is behind Cornwall\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/eden-project\">Eden Project</a>).</p> \n<p>Inside the pillow dome was a miniature forest of plants, tropical fish ponds and a ripening fig tree. Fuller nodded with approval. \u201cHe said, \u2018She\u2019s beautiful,\u2019\u201d recalls <a href=\"https://centerforneweconomics.org/people/nancy-jack-todd/\">Nancy Jack Todd</a>, co-founder of the New Alchemy Institute (NAI), along with her husband John. \u201cHe turned around and said to John with this happy smile: \u2018This is what I\u2019ve always wanted to see: my architecture with your biology.\u2019 He called the work we were doing \u2018the hope of the world\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2206bccb3d7a715b5be018c4459dd7ac2dd9556d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2206bccb3d7a715b5be018c4459dd7ac2dd9556d/0_85_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group meeting of the New Alchemists in Cape Cod.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A group meeting of the New Alchemists in Cape Cod.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: New Alchemy staff</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Founded in 1969, the NAI set out to design a sustainable way of living from top to bottom: food, energy and shelter. This was the era of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/27/rachel-carson-silent-spring-anniversary\">Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/25/the-guardian-view-on-james-lovelock-earth-but-not-as-we-knew-it\">James Lovelock</a>\u2019s Gaia hypothesis, and the <a href=\"http://www.wholeearth.com/index.php\">Whole Earth Catalog</a> (of which Baldwin was an editor). It was the era of anti-nuclear and anti-Vietnam war movements; a time when huge numbers of people felt that modern society was on the wrong path, and better alternatives were possible. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we were on the same page as Bucky,\u201d <a href=\"https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/the-new-alchemy-institute-d0992ce33a68\">John Todd</a> says, \u201cbut we came to the same conclusions. His basic message, about how to do more with less, really resonated with us.\u201d</p> \n<p>The New Alchemists\u2019 alternative was a harmonious system of organic farming, renewable energy, sustainable architecture, waste treatment and ecosystem restoration. No pesticides or chemicals, no fossil fuels, no waste, no pollution, low impact, energy efficient. In other words, they were doing 50 years ago what we\u2019re now realising we should have been doing all along.</p> \n<p>Despite their long hair and countercultural leanings, the New Alchemists were not hippies; they were scientists. John Todd, the driving force behind the NAI, is a marine biologist by training; his wife Nancy is a writer and activist, and the third founding member, <a href=\"https://www.bpr.org/post/how-little-tennessee-river-was-saved-25-years-ago#stream/0\">Bill McLarney</a>, is a fish biologist. True, <a href=\"https://newalchemists.net/publications/new-alchemy-1971-1991/\">their large-format journals</a> of the time have a quaint, radical vibe to them, with their intricate hand-drawn covers depicting unicorns and dragons. But alongside quotations from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jrrtolkien\">Tolkien</a> and poems about mushrooms are reports on their experiments on the insect-resistance of certain cabbage varieties, diagrams of their low-tech wind turbines or progress reports on aquaculture techniques.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b7bbd4d3c66cc6e78ab1d9ca3ed46cbf5f224452\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7bbd4d3c66cc6e78ab1d9ca3ed46cbf5f224452/62_111_769_940/409.jpg\" alt=\"Plans for a wind-driven thermal system for a dairy farm (including a cow wash).\" width=\"409\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plans for a wind-driven thermal system for a dairy farm (including a cow wash).</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Journal of the New Alchemists</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nor was the NAI a \u201ccommune\u201d. It was a research project, the Todds explain; people came there to work, not to play. At its peak, the NAI had around 30 members, aided by hundreds more temporary volunteers. Few actually lived on the site. There were no experiments in common ownership or free love. The Todds and their three young children lived in a small cottage a few miles away, where they still live today.</p> \n<p>\u201cSocially, we agreed, the three of us founders, that we wanted to lead private lives,\u201d Nancy says. \u201cWe felt that there were too many revolutions underneath it already without trying to do a social one as well.\u201d Besides, John adds, \u201cBeing somewhat reserved Canadians, there is not a lot of gossip or juicy stories.\u201d</p> \n<p>The catalyst for the NAI was frustration with academia, John says. In the late 60s, he and McLarney both began teaching at San Diego State University, where John was to head up a new department of environmental studies. He soon hit a wall of institutional inflexibility: \u201cThe idea of doing activities from various disciplines \u2013 energy, architecture, agriculture, waste water, you name it \u2013 was simply not possible within the university setting at that time. A number of people, who became very close friends, were coming to the same conclusion: that we had to find new institutional structures to go after a larger vision.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Todds and McLarney quit academia, found new jobs at an oceanographic institute in Cape Cod and started to put their New Alchemist ideas into practice on a 12-acre plot of land. The first objective was agriculture. They set about improving the soil quality and planting food crops. They began breeding rabbits and digging fish ponds. McLarney introduced the then-unheard-of tilapia, an easily farmable fish. Other friends and colleagues came to join them. <a href=\"https://www.nfb.ca/film/new_alchemists/\">A 1973 film made by the National Film Board of Canada</a> portrays the NAI as an Arcadian utopia: a lush, green world of healthy, happy people tending healthy, happy crops. They build wind turbines out of car parts and oil drums, swim in the pond, gather for communal outdoor meals, scavenge at the local dump and play guitars together in the sunset. It almost looks like a parody.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93d4490d9e4412f09fd44c805f3ba5dad6c65994\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93d4490d9e4412f09fd44c805f3ba5dad6c65994/0_224_5561_3338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children play outside the ark for Prince Edward Island in 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children play outside the ark for Prince Edward Island in 1976.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nancy Willis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The NAI\u2019s approach was a combination of old-fashioned common sense and modern scientific method. Everything was monitored and recorded: weather conditions, soil chemistry, crop yields, numbers of midge larvae (used as fish food) growing in different qualities of water. Data was analysed, techniques were compared, processes were refined, until their organic yields exceeded those of industrial farms. But underpinning it all was John\u2019s belief that natural systems could be duplicated, harnessed and harmoniously interlinked. The wind pumps the water, that waters the garden, that grows the carrots, that feed the rabbits, that fertilise the earthworms, that feed the fish, along with the carrot tops. And it all feeds the people. \u201cEach time we make a connection, as in nature itself, the whole becomes more stable, more strong and more healthy,\u201d John says in the film.</p> \n<p>In one significant, typically low-tech breakthrough, John began to experiment with 5ft translucent cylindrical water tanks \u2013 filling them with pond water and observing the miniature ecosystems that formed inside. As the tanks received more sunlight than a pond would, algae and other life grew much quicker. They were perfect for cultivating fish in (tilapia eat the algae). You could link them together and water would become progressively cleaner as it flowed from one to the next. You could grow vegetables hydroponically on their surface. Most importantly, the water heated up in the sun, so the tanks became an effective store of solar energy \u2013 \u201cthermal flywheel\u201d, as John puts it.</p> \n<p>All of this fed into the New Alchemists\u2019 approach to more complex architecture. Where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/lecorbusier\">Le Corbusier</a> famously decreed that a house is a \u201cmachine for living\u201d, the New Alchemists believed it should be more like a \u201cliving machine\u201d \u2013 a combination of architecture and biology. \u201cOur first little experiment used a geodesic structure to literally create a miniature world,\u201d John says, explaining a 1971 forerunner of the pillow dome, which they built over a fish pond. \u201cInside the structure, the air was the atmosphere; the water was analogous to the 70% oceans the Earth needs to maintain a stable climate; the remaining 30% was a quite complex ecosystem, considering the size of the project. So we were already using the Earth as a model for design.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd4122cdb0e4759345c5fc170785d140c5efe36f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd4122cdb0e4759345c5fc170785d140c5efe36f/0_0_921_1198/769.jpg\" alt=\"Plans for the ark, which we would recognise today as a show-home for \u201coff-grid\u201d living, employing sustainable design principles.\" width=\"769\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plans for the ark, which we would recognise today as a show-home for \u201coff-grid\u201d living, employing sustainable design principles.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Journal of the New Alchemists</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The New Alchemists\u2019 most ambitious structures were what they called \u201c<a href=\"https://newalchemists.net/portfolio/bioshelter-arks/\">arks</a>\u201d \u2013 two experiments into the \u201cshelter\u201d aspect of their mission. Two young architects from Yale University, David Bergmark and Ole Hammarlund, led the design: one ark in Cape Cod and another on Prince Edward Island, Canada, thanks to a commission from the Canadian government.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://peiark.com/\">Prince Edward Island ark</a>, on a windblown promontory surrounded by the sea on three sides, was the New Alchemists\u2019 architectural high point. We would recognise it today as a show-home for \u201coff-grid\u201d living, employing sustainable design principles that are now common practice but were nascent, untested technologies at the time. Aligned east-west, the Prince Edward Island ark was partly sunken into the earth on its north side, with sloping glazing along its south facade to capture maximum solar radiation. The south facade also featured a row of vertically aligned solar collectors (heating water rather than generating electricity \u2013 photovoltaic technology was nowhere near advanced enough yet). A prototype hydraulic wind turbine nearby covered the building\u2019s electricity needs.</p> \n<p>The dominant space inside was a high-ceilinged greenhouse containing plant beds for growing vegetables, herbs, flowers and tree saplings. Lizards, newts, ladybirds and even a resident snake controlled insect populations. The ark also contained 32 of Todd\u2019s \u201csolar-algae tanks\u201d \u2013 primarily for fish cultivation, but the tanks proved so effective at storing heat that the building\u2019s other experimental climate systems became redundant. \u201cWe were growing bananas in January,\u201d says Todd. When a winter storm caused a three-day power cut and buried the landscape in snow, the ark remained a stable temperature inside.</p> \n<p>About one-third of the ark was a home, where the Todds\u2019 New Alchemist friend <a href=\"http://bynancywillis.com/?page_id=2\">Nancy Willis</a> and her family lived happily for a time, growing their own produce and managing the \u201cliving machine\u201d. Though light and spacious, the ark was not the stuff of high-end design aesthetically, but it represented a potential new way of living \u2013 sustainable, self-sufficient, integrated with nature on an intimate scale. Shelter, food, energy. Perhaps a social revolution after all.</p> \n<p>The Prince Edward Island ark was opened in September 1976 by Canadian prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau (father of current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">PM Justin</a>), who arrived by helicopter with much fanfare to find a bunch of dirty, exhausted New Alchemists who had completed the build hours before. Trudeau gave a stirring speech about how the ark was \u201cthe birth of the new philosophy\u201d and told the Todds he would like to have a similar house for his own family. \u201cVery close by was a nuclear plant,\u201d Nancy recalls, \u201cso I said to him, \u2018All of this makes nuclear energy completely unnecessary, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d Trudeau\u2019s answer was noncommittal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"850beb9c1416f13fa38f52f95f85bc8c95d7a202\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/850beb9c1416f13fa38f52f95f85bc8c95d7a202/199_146_5111_3684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Architects David Bergmark and Ole Hammarlund, outside the ark for Prince Edward Island, autumn 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"721\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Architects David Bergmark and Ole Hammarlund, outside the ark for Prince Edward Island, autumn 1976.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Solsearch Architects</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The fate of the Prince Edward Island ark mirrors that of not only the NAI itself, but the whole sustainability movement of the 70s. Functionally, the building exceeded expectations. The hydraulic wind turbine proved to be a failure and the solar collectors leaked, but the \u201cliving machine\u201d was alive and well, drawing visitors, spreading the sustainability gospel and growing enough vegetables and fish to sell surplus to local restaurants. But politically, the winds were changing. By 1981, their Canadian government allies were no longer in office and financial support dried up. After numerous rescue attempts, the ark was converted into a small hotel and restaurant in the early 80s. Around 2000, it was demolished.</p> \n<p>A similar change of sentiment hobbled the NAI in Cape Cod. During the 70s, it had been funded by a series of grants from the US government and private foundations. But as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ronald-reagan\">the Reagan era</a> set in, those funds became harder to access. The sentiment became more \u201cme\u201d than \u201cwe\u201d. The hippies cut their hair, abandoned their geodesic domes and found proper jobs. The NAI survived Reaganism, but much of its energy through the 80s went into merely staying afloat, rather than \u201cpushing the vision\u201d, as John puts it. It eventually dissolved in 1991.</p> \n<p>But the New Alchemists found other ways to push their vision. McLarney founded an offshoot of the institute in Costa Rica, named <a href=\"https://www.anaicostarica.org/history.html\">ANAI</a>, which has transformed the country\u2019s southern Caribbean coast and become a model for conservation and sustainable development. Architects Bergmark and Ole remained in the Prince Edward Island region practising sustainable design. The New Alchemists\u2019 Cape Cod plot was turned into a co-housing project, complete with a refurbished ark.</p> \n<p>John Todd retreated from architecture and returned to his first love: water. Those experiments with solar-algae tanks put him on a path of environmental restoration, using natural systems to improve water quality and remove pollution. He realised a long time ago what the world is just beginning to realise now: that ecosystem restoration is key to stabilising the climate, and nature itself can help provide the answers. In 1982 the Todds founded a new initiative, <a href=\"https://www.oceanarksint.org/\">Ocean Arks International</a>, researching and applying this knowledge in multiple situations, from natural wastewater treatment to ocean-going eco-repair vessels to an ambitious project to re-green the Sinai desert (it even involves geodesic domes). It is a continuation of what the New Alchemists began, John says: \u201cDoing good things in bad places.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rather than feeling bleak about the future, he is surprisingly optimistic. He recently published a book called <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/healing-earth-9781623172985.html\">Healing Earth</a>, part-autobiography, part-manual on how to save the world. Its opening line reads: \u201cI am writing this book based on the belief that humanity will soon become involved in a deep and abiding worldwide partnership with nature.\u201d Yes, the planet is in crisis, but rather than what the New Alchemists called \u201cdoomwatch science\u201d \u2013 monitoring environmental decline \u2013 John Todd has always been focused on practical solutions. \u201cThe more we weave together the knowledge that\u2019s been accumulated in the last 100 years, the more we can do things that we never dreamed of,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to invent anything; we just have to pay attention to what\u2019s been learned.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>A Safe and Sustainable World: The Promise Of Ecological Design by Nancy Jack Todd is <a href=\"https://islandpress.org/books/safe-and-sustainable-world\">available now (\u00a325, Island Press)</a>.</em></p> \n<p><em>Living Lightly on the Earth: Building an Ark for Prince Edward Island 1974\u201176 by Steven Mannell is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Living-Lightly-Earth-Building-Canadian/dp/0929112695\">available now (\u00a330, Dalhousie Architectural)</a></em></p>",

Lightweight, efficient, simple to construct and futuristic, domes became a hippy cliche in the 70s, but the New Alchemists\u2019 dome was a little different. Designed by Fuller\u2019s disciple Jay Baldwin, it was the first \u201cpillow dome\u201d: made of triangular panels of transparent plastic inflated with argon gas, which improved its insulation properties (the same technology is behind Cornwall\u2019s Eden Project). Inside the pillow dome was a miniature forest of plants, tropical fish ponds and a ripening fig tree. Fuller nodded with approval. \u201cHe said, \u2018She\u2019s beautiful,\u2019\u201d recalls Nancy Jack Todd, co-founder of the New Alchemy Institute (NAI), along with her husband John. \u201cHe turned around and said to John with this happy smile: \u2018This is what I\u2019ve always wanted to see: my architecture with your biology.\u2019 He called the work we were doing \u2018the hope of the world\u2019.\u201d Founded in 1969, the NAI set out to design a sustainable way of living from top to bottom: food, energy and shelter. This was the era of Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring, James Lovelock\u2019s Gaia hypothesis, and the Whole Earth Catalog (of which Baldwin was an editor). It was the era of anti-nuclear and anti-Vietnam war movements; a time when huge numbers of people felt that modern society was on the wrong path, and better alternatives were possible. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we were on the same page as Bucky,\u201d John Todd says, \u201cbut we came to the same conclusions. His basic message, about how to do more with less, really resonated with us.\u201d The New Alchemists\u2019 alternative was a harmonious system of organic farming, renewable energy, sustainable architecture, waste treatment and ecosystem restoration. No pesticides or chemicals, no fossil fuels, no waste, no pollution, low impact, energy efficient. In other words, they were doing 50 years ago what we\u2019re now realising we should have been doing all along. Despite their long hair and countercultural leanings, the New Alchemists were not hippies; they were scientists. John Todd, the driving force behind the NAI, is a marine biologist by training; his wife Nancy is a writer and activist, and the third founding member, Bill McLarney, is a fish biologist. True, their large-format journals of the time have a quaint, radical vibe to them, with their intricate hand-drawn covers depicting unicorns and dragons. But alongside quotations from Tolkien and poems about mushrooms are reports on their experiments on the insect-resistance of certain cabbage varieties, diagrams of their low-tech wind turbines or progress reports on aquaculture techniques. Nor was the NAI a \u201ccommune\u201d. It was a research project, the Todds explain; people came there to work, not to play. At its peak, the NAI had around 30 members, aided by hundreds more temporary volunteers. Few actually lived on the site. There were no experiments in common ownership or free love. The Todds and their three young children lived in a small cottage a few miles away, where they still live today. \u201cSocially, we agreed, the three of us founders, that we wanted to lead private lives,\u201d Nancy says. \u201cWe felt that there were too many revolutions underneath it already without trying to do a social one as well.\u201d Besides, John adds, \u201cBeing somewhat reserved Canadians, there is not a lot of gossip or juicy stories.\u201d The catalyst for the NAI was frustration with academia, John says. In the late 60s, he and McLarney both began teaching at San Diego State University, where John was to head up a new department of environmental studies. He soon hit a wall of institutional inflexibility: \u201cThe idea of doing activities from various disciplines \u2013 energy, architecture, agriculture, waste water, you name it \u2013 was simply not possible within the university setting at that time. A number of people, who became very close friends, were coming to the same conclusion: that we had to find new institutional structures to go after a larger vision.\u201d The Todds and McLarney quit academia, found new jobs at an oceanographic institute in Cape Cod and started to put their New Alchemist ideas into practice on a 12-acre plot of land. The first objective was agriculture. They set about improving the soil quality and planting food crops. They began breeding rabbits and digging fish ponds. McLarney introduced the then-unheard-of tilapia, an easily farmable fish. Other friends and colleagues came to join them. A 1973 film made by the National Film Board of Canada portrays the NAI as an Arcadian utopia: a lush, green world of healthy, happy people tending healthy, happy crops. They build wind turbines out of car parts and oil drums, swim in the pond, gather for communal outdoor meals, scavenge at the local dump and play guitars together in the sunset. It almost looks like a parody. The NAI\u2019s approach was a combination of old-fashioned common sense and modern scientific method. Everything was monitored and recorded: weather conditions, soil chemistry, crop yields, numbers of midge larvae (used as fish food) growing in different qualities of water. Data was analysed, techniques were compared, processes were refined, until their organic yields exceeded those of industrial farms. But underpinning it all was John\u2019s belief that natural systems could be duplicated, harnessed and harmoniously interlinked. The wind pumps the water, that waters the garden, that grows the carrots, that feed the rabbits, that fertilise the earthworms, that feed the fish, along with the carrot tops. And it all feeds the people. \u201cEach time we make a connection, as in nature itself, the whole becomes more stable, more strong and more healthy,\u201d John says in the film. In one significant, typically low-tech breakthrough, John began to experiment with 5ft translucent cylindrical water tanks \u2013 filling them with pond water and observing the miniature ecosystems that formed inside. As the tanks received more sunlight than a pond would, algae and other life grew much quicker. They were perfect for cultivating fish in (tilapia eat the algae). You could link them together and water would become progressively cleaner as it flowed from one to the next. You could grow vegetables hydroponically on their surface. Most importantly, the water heated up in the sun, so the tanks became an effective store of solar energy \u2013 \u201cthermal flywheel\u201d, as John puts it. All of this fed into the New Alchemists\u2019 approach to more complex architecture. Where Le Corbusier famously decreed that a house is a \u201cmachine for living\u201d, the New Alchemists believed it should be more like a \u201cliving machine\u201d \u2013 a combination of architecture and biology. \u201cOur first little experiment used a geodesic structure to literally create a miniature world,\u201d John says, explaining a 1971 forerunner of the pillow dome, which they built over a fish pond. \u201cInside the structure, the air was the atmosphere; the water was analogous to the 70% oceans the Earth needs to maintain a stable climate; the remaining 30% was a quite complex ecosystem, considering the size of the project. So we were already using the Earth as a model for design.\u201d The New Alchemists\u2019 most ambitious structures were what they called \u201carks\u201d \u2013 two experiments into the \u201cshelter\u201d aspect of their mission. Two young architects from Yale University, David Bergmark and Ole Hammarlund, led the design: one ark in Cape Cod and another on Prince Edward Island, Canada, thanks to a commission from the Canadian government. The Prince Edward Island ark, on a windblown promontory surrounded by the sea on three sides, was the New Alchemists\u2019 architectural high point. We would recognise it today as a show-home for \u201coff-grid\u201d living, employing sustainable design principles that are now common practice but were nascent, untested technologies at the time. Aligned east-west, the Prince Edward Island ark was partly sunken into the earth on its north side, with sloping glazing along its south facade to capture maximum solar radiation. The south facade also featured a row of vertically aligned solar collectors (heating water rather than generating electricity \u2013 photovoltaic technology was nowhere near advanced enough yet). A prototype hydraulic wind turbine nearby covered the building\u2019s electricity needs. The dominant space inside was a high-ceilinged greenhouse containing plant beds for growing vegetables, herbs, flowers and tree saplings. Lizards, newts, ladybirds and even a resident snake controlled insect populations. The ark also contained 32 of Todd\u2019s \u201csolar-algae tanks\u201d \u2013 primarily for fish cultivation, but the tanks proved so effective at storing heat that the building\u2019s other experimental climate systems became redundant. \u201cWe were growing bananas in January,\u201d says Todd. When a winter storm caused a three-day power cut and buried the landscape in snow, the ark remained a stable temperature inside. About one-third of the ark was a home, where the Todds\u2019 New Alchemist friend Nancy Willis and her family lived happily for a time, growing their own produce and managing the \u201cliving machine\u201d. Though light and spacious, the ark was not the stuff of high-end design aesthetically, but it represented a potential new way of living \u2013 sustainable, self-sufficient, integrated with nature on an intimate scale. Shelter, food, energy. Perhaps a social revolution after all. The Prince Edward Island ark was opened in September 1976 by Canadian prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau (father of current PM Justin), who arrived by helicopter with much fanfare to find a bunch of dirty, exhausted New Alchemists who had completed the build hours before. Trudeau gave a stirring speech about how the ark was \u201cthe birth of the new philosophy\u201d and told the Todds he would like to have a similar house for his own family. \u201cVery close by was a nuclear plant,\u201d Nancy recalls, \u201cso I said to him, \u2018All of this makes nuclear energy completely unnecessary, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d Trudeau\u2019s answer was noncommittal. The fate of the Prince Edward Island ark mirrors that of not only the NAI itself, but the whole sustainability movement of the 70s. Functionally, the building exceeded expectations. The hydraulic wind turbine proved to be a failure and the solar collectors leaked, but the \u201cliving machine\u201d was alive and well, drawing visitors, spreading the sustainability gospel and growing enough vegetables and fish to sell surplus to local restaurants. But politically, the winds were changing. By 1981, their Canadian government allies were no longer in office and financial support dried up. After numerous rescue attempts, the ark was converted into a small hotel and restaurant in the early 80s. Around 2000, it was demolished. A similar change of sentiment hobbled the NAI in Cape Cod. During the 70s, it had been funded by a series of grants from the US government and private foundations. But as the Reagan era set in, those funds became harder to access. The sentiment became more \u201cme\u201d than \u201cwe\u201d. The hippies cut their hair, abandoned their geodesic domes and found proper jobs. The NAI survived Reaganism, but much of its energy through the 80s went into merely staying afloat, rather than \u201cpushing the vision\u201d, as John puts it. It eventually dissolved in 1991. But the New Alchemists found other ways to push their vision. McLarney founded an offshoot of the institute in Costa Rica, named ANAI, which has transformed the country\u2019s southern Caribbean coast and become a model for conservation and sustainable development. Architects Bergmark and Ole remained in the Prince Edward Island region practising sustainable design. The New Alchemists\u2019 Cape Cod plot was turned into a co-housing project, complete with a refurbished ark. John Todd retreated from architecture and returned to his first love: water. Those experiments with solar-algae tanks put him on a path of environmental restoration, using natural systems to improve water quality and remove pollution. He realised a long time ago what the world is just beginning to realise now: that ecosystem restoration is key to stabilising the climate, and nature itself can help provide the answers. In 1982 the Todds founded a new initiative, Ocean Arks International, researching and applying this knowledge in multiple situations, from natural wastewater treatment to ocean-going eco-repair vessels to an ambitious project to re-green the Sinai desert (it even involves geodesic domes). It is a continuation of what the New Alchemists began, John says: \u201cDoing good things in bad places.\u201d Rather than feeling bleak about the future, he is surprisingly optimistic. He recently published a book called Healing Earth, part-autobiography, part-manual on how to save the world. Its opening line reads: \u201cI am writing this book based on the belief that humanity will soon become involved in a deep and abiding worldwide partnership with nature.\u201d Yes, the planet is in crisis, but rather than what the New Alchemists called \u201cdoomwatch science\u201d \u2013 monitoring environmental decline \u2013 John Todd has always been focused on practical solutions. \u201cThe more we weave together the knowledge that\u2019s been accumulated in the last 100 years, the more we can do things that we never dreamed of,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to invent anything; we just have to pay attention to what\u2019s been learned.\u201d A Safe and Sustainable World: The Promise Of Ecological Design by Nancy Jack Todd is available now (\u00a325, Island Press). Living Lightly on the Earth: Building an Ark for Prince Edward Island 1974\u201176 by Steven Mannell is available now (\u00a330, Dalhousie Architectural)",

      "bodyText": "Wales used to be the masters of the drop goal. A method of scoring that has become an endangered species accounted for more than one quarter of Barry John\u2019s points tally for his country. In one club match for Cardiff, when two of Llanelli\u2019s back-row forwards were his brothers who had threatened all sorts if they got hold of him, the game\u2019s greatest fly-half barely made a break or passed all match, but his four drop kicks delivered a 12-9 victory. Before Sunday\u2019s effective group decider against Australia, it had been 35 internationals since Wales had scored with a drop goal. It was through necessity then, the fly-half Sam Davies winning the 2016 game against Japan in Cardiff with three points seconds from full time, but here it was a tactic that won a game in which Wales were outscored by three tries to two. Dan Biggar\u2019s drop goal after 36 seconds, the quickest in the history of the World Cup, and another by his replacement Rhys Patchell three minutes into the second half, proved the difference between the sides in a fixture that has invariably this decade been decided by a few points. Until last November\u2019s 9-6 victory in Cardiff, they had lost 13 matches in a row to the Wallabies, several in the final minutes. They absorbed two key details which they used to telling effect in delivering their first victory over a major southern hemisphere nation in the group or knockout stage of a World Cup: they turned pressure into points and held their nerve in the closing minutes so that when Australia sought to make their greater composure and technique tell, it was Wales who were making the right decisions. The Wallabies became gripped by despair \u2013 eventually blundering their way to a defeat that leaves them probably needing to beat England and New Zealand to reach the final. Wales\u2019s ascent to the top looks less steep. With Fiji and Uruguay to come, they are on course to finish at the top of a World Cup pool for the third time: the other two occasions, in 1987 and 1999, did not include a tier one nation from the south and 20 years ago, when they were hosts, they were not inconvenienced by one from the north. The significance of a victory that leaves them with a potential quarter-final against France is that it was the first of its kind on this stage. After Ireland\u2019s defeat to Japan the previous day, Joe Schmidt was described as being a \u201czombie coach\u201d because he is standing down at the end of the tournament, a factor perceived to be behind his side\u2019s lack of an edge against the hosts. Warren Gatland is in his final weeks in charge of Wales, but every time the camera focused on the box he and his fellow management team were closeted in, the animation on their faces reflecting the desire, drive and determination shown by the players as Australia fought back in the second half. It matters to Schmidt every bit as much as it does to Gatland but it is Wales, for so long a World Cup laughing stock, beaten by (Western) Samoa in 1991 and 1999 and Fiji eight years later, a period when they qualified for the last eight in only two tournaments in five, this was redemption. It did not take Gatland long to crack Europe \u2013 a mere couple of months \u2013 but the south took a little longer, some 10 years. Winston Churchill, rather than one of his admirers, may have been prime minister when Wales last defeated New Zealand, but South Africa have been mastered in the last four years and now Australia. What was notable about this victory was that when he started planning for the pool two years ago, Gatland would have been counting on the likes of Sam Warburton, Taulupe Faletau and Rhys Webb, Lions all, to help him break new ground. They were all elsewhere but barely missed. Aaron Wainwright was involved in everything until his legs gave out from the effort, Josh Navidi helped thwart Australia\u2019s threat at the breakdown and, at scrum-half, Gareth Davies scored one of his side\u2019s two tries with a trademark interception and his scampering, hurry-up style allowed Wales to play with tempo and width in the opening half when they built up a 15-point lead. Another Gareth Davies, who played for Cardiff, Wales and the Lions in the 1970s and 1980s and is now the Welsh Rugby Union chairman, was one of the many drop-goal specialists Wales used to manufacture, but his namesake, in a position that not long ago looked to be one of Wales\u2019s few areas of weakness because of the France-based Webb\u2019s unavailability, dropped Australia in it and kept Wales on course for Gatland\u2019s fitting finale.",

Earlier this month Trump dismissed suggestions of impropriety over his vice-president\u2019s stay at Doonbeg and the US military\u2019s use of an airport near his Turnberry golf course in Scotland. The US president tweeted that he had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with Mike Pence\u2019s stay and \u201cknew nothing\u201d about the official use of the airport near his course. A US congressional committee has been investigating whether increasing expenditure at the airport and allegations of US military personnel being offered discount deals at Trump\u2019s Ayrshire golf resort represent a violation of the US constitution. Trump\u2019s stays at his own properties \u2013 the most high profile of which has been Mar-a-Lago in Florida, as well as government and diplomatic use of his hotel in Washington, have increasingly raised eyebrows. During the G7 summit in Biarritz in August the US president also suggested that the 2020 summit should be held at his golf resort in Doral, Florida.",

      "bodyText": "About 500 former Wrightbus employees and their families have held a protest outside a church linked to millions of pounds in donations from the owners of the collapsed bus maker. About 1,200 jobs were lost last week when the Ballymena-based producer of the Routemaster bus used in London went into administration. The Unite union has warned a further 1,700 jobs could be at risk in the engineering company\u2019s supply chain. Colin Graham, a Unite shop steward, said the former workers, wearing T-shirts saying \u201csave our jobs\u201d and banners emblazoned with the words \u201cshameless greed\u201d and \u201cyou reap what you sow\u201d, were carrying out a peaceful protest amid heavy security including private guards employed by the Wright family. He said the founder, Sir William Wright, who received applause as he arrived at the church, had told workers he was sorry about the way things had turned out. Graham said: \u201cWe\u2019re not here to shame the whole Wright family, we\u2019re here to shame Jeff Wright alone.\u201d Jeff Wright is the founder\u2019s son and a major shareholder of Wright Group\u2019s holding company. The parent company of Wrightbus, Cornerstone Group, donated more than \u00a316.1m to charity between 2012 and 2017. A proportion of these donations helped fund the expansion of Green Pastures, an evangelical church in Ballymena led by Jeff Wright. The company also paid out \u00a32m in dividends to shareholders, most of which went to Jeff Wright and a group called the Wright Evangelical Trust, over the five-year period. In 2017, Cornerstone paid out \u00a3400,000 in dividends and \u00a34.15m in charitable donations, despite making a \u00a31.7m loss, compared with a profit of \u00a310.8m the year before. \u201cHow could he donate to the church without looking after the workforce and keeping the company going? That\u2019s what we want answered,\u201d Graham said. The donations preceded increasing financial difficulties for Wrightbus, which made two rounds of redundancies last year, with 95 jobs going in February and June. These were despite recent sales successes, including a Transport for London order in May for 20 hydrogen-powered buses, each costing about \u00a3500,000 and only emitting water vapour. Wrightbus went into administration after having cash flow problems and failing to find a new owner. Administrators at Deloitte are continuing to seek a white knight investor. They are thought to have contacted a number of potential bidders who previously expressed interest in the company, including Jo Bamford, the son of the JCB billionaire tycoon Lord Bamford, the Northern Ireland businessman Darren Donnelly and the Chinese company Weichai, which is part of the state-owned conglomerate Shandong Heavy Industry. Police in Northern Ireland have been investigating death threats against the Wright family.

People from Rosslea gravitated towards Enniskillen, 24 miles away, because there was less hassle. Clones suffered badly, with businesses disappearing through lack of custom.</p> <p>\u201cThere were no new businesses opening in the town. Protestants wouldn\u2019t come here to shop or to have a drink,\u201d said Mulhall. \u201cThe disconnect was always there. Even though people lived just two miles away, the habits were formed and were ingrained and when peace came, it was still difficult to persuade people to come into town.\u201d</p> <p>Five years since opening, The Peace Link is now proving a cross-community draw and building social cohesion.</p> <p>\u201cWe have people from all over the place, people in their 40s who grew up in the Troubles coming in and meeting people they would not have met before even though they just lived out the road,\u201d said Mulhall. \u201cYou hear them saying: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a nice guy, they are all normal.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cYes, suspicions will be there for a long time between Protestants and Catholics, but in this place [the sports centre], religion doesn\u2019t matter like it did.\u201d</p> <p>Business in Clones has also picked up, with a couple of new shops. \u201cWe\u2019re still about a fifth of where we were before the Troubles. We\u2019re only looking for our fair share, to get back what we lost during the Troubles, and Brexit puts that at risk,\u201d said Mulhall.</p> <p>\u201cIf there are any checks on the road, these people will turn back to their old ways and reverse what has happened.\u201d</p>",

Any intensification of that will effectively mean holdups and delays. That is a hard border. It\u2019s not watchtowers or soldiers,\u201d the owner said. The road, despite being a rural single carriageway, is the main artery from Cavan to Monaghan, shuddering with HGVs and dairy collection tankers whose drivers barely register as they pass from the N54 (Irish road name) to the A3 (Northern Irish road name) and back again to the N54. Johnston said: \u201cI cross the border six or seven times a day; so do most of my customers. What are we going to do after Brexit?\u201d He owns an agriculture and equine supplies business and has already taken steps to mitigate the impact of a no-deal Brexit, opening a second shop across the border in Butlers Bridge to ensure he keeps supplies and custom flowing in the event of mandatory checks on agrifeed. For dairy farmers like Thompson on the border, Brexit poses an existential threat, and faith in politicians is in short supply. \u201cBrexit is just less than 40 days away and we are still in the dark. No one has spoken to us,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we couldn\u2019t get our milk collected every day or if there is a tariff, we would go out of business.\u201d The flourishing local dairy business has consolidated to such an extent that much of the creamery production is south of the border, leaving farmers metres or miles to the north on a Brexit cliff edge. They are paid 24 cents (21p) a litre, but EU tariffs on imports to the Irish Republic would add 21 cents a litre to the cost, leaving the farmer with no business. There is also a fear that communities once split in two by border checks, road closures and sectarianism are at risk of a repeat division because of Brexit. Ciaran Mulhall, an administrator at The Peace Link, a sports centre, said: \u201cThere are eight roads into the town, but only two or three were open in the Troubles. It meant people from nearby couldn\u2019t be bothered coming into Clones.\u201d It was built with \u00a36m of EU money and has been vital in building post-conflict relations through sport. Rosslea, the hometown of the Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster \u2013 four miles away \u2013 felt light years away during the Troubles. \u201cThat four-mile journey turned into a 16-mile journey into Clones because of detours caused by road closures,\u201d said Mulhall. People from Rosslea gravitated towards Enniskillen, 24 miles away, because there was less hassle. Clones suffered badly, with businesses disappearing through lack of custom. \u201cThere were no new businesses opening in the town. Protestants wouldn\u2019t come here to shop or to have a drink,\u201d said Mulhall. \u201cThe disconnect was always there. Even though people lived just two miles away, the habits were formed and were ingrained and when peace came, it was still difficult to persuade people to come into town.\u201d Five years since opening, The Peace Link is now proving a cross-community draw and building social cohesion. \u201cWe have people from all over the place, people in their 40s who grew up in the Troubles coming in and meeting people they would not have met before even though they just lived out the road,\u201d said Mulhall. \u201cYou hear them saying: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a nice guy, they are all normal.\u2019 \u201cYes, suspicions will be there for a long time between Protestants and Catholics, but in this place [the sports centre], religion doesn\u2019t matter like it did.\u201d Business in Clones has also picked up, with a couple of new shops. \u201cWe\u2019re still about a fifth of where we were before the Troubles. We\u2019re only looking for our fair share, to get back what we lost during the Troubles, and Brexit puts that at risk,\u201d said Mulhall. \u201cIf there are any checks on the road, these people will turn back to their old ways and reverse what has happened.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Margaret Thatcher knew what she wanted to do when she came to power in 1979. She planned to tackle inflation, cut taxes, roll back the state, and give employers the right to manage by reducing the power of trade unions.</p> <p>By the time Thatcher left office in 1990 inflation was still a headache for the government and there had been no real change in the size of the state. But by the mid-1980s, a combination of mass unemployment, the defeat of the miners in their year-long strike and a raft of tougher labour laws had fundamentally changed the balance of power in the workplace.</p> <p>This was not unique to Britain. Indeed, one of the starkest changes in political economy over the past 40 years has been the victory across the developed world of capital in its struggle with labour for a share of the spoils.</p> <p>At its simplest, the annual economic output of a country can be divided into two parts: the slice that goes to workers in the form of wages and salaries, and the bit that goes to the owners of capital in the shape of profits and dividends.</p> <p>Back in 1980, labour\u2019s share of the pie in developed countries stood at more than 61%, but it has been pretty much downhill all the way ever since. Income from employment as a share of gross domestic product is now below 55%.</p> <p>The free-market thinkers that inspired Thatcher said that raising the share of national income going to capital was long overdue. By the 1970s, it was said, decades of full employment had allowed trade unions to get an excessive share of national output, leaving too little left over for firms to spend on new plant and machinery. The theory was that a rising profit share would lead to higher investment, faster productivity and more well-paid jobs.</p> <p>Suffice it to say, this has not happened. In countries such as the US and the UK, the stock of fixed capital is lower than it was in the mid-1980s, according to <a href=\"https://unctad.org/en/pages/PublicationWebflyer.aspx?publicationid=2526\">last week\u2019s report</a> by the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60c4c9d54e65347d2cc7b9c8a07b655c4b6606fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c4c9d54e65347d2cc7b9c8a07b655c4b6606fd/185_336_2376_1426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher on the campaign trail in 1983\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher on the campaign trail in 1983.

      "bodyText": "Margaret Thatcher knew what she wanted to do when she came to power in 1979. She planned to tackle inflation, cut taxes, roll back the state, and give employers the right to manage by reducing the power of trade unions. By the time Thatcher left office in 1990 inflation was still a headache for the government and there had been no real change in the size of the state. But by the mid-1980s, a combination of mass unemployment, the defeat of the miners in their year-long strike and a raft of tougher labour laws had fundamentally changed the balance of power in the workplace. This was not unique to Britain. Indeed, one of the starkest changes in political economy over the past 40 years has been the victory across the developed world of capital in its struggle with labour for a share of the spoils. At its simplest, the annual economic output of a country can be divided into two parts: the slice that goes to workers in the form of wages and salaries, and the bit that goes to the owners of capital in the shape of profits and dividends. Back in 1980, labour\u2019s share of the pie in developed countries stood at more than 61%, but it has been pretty much downhill all the way ever since. Income from employment as a share of gross domestic product is now below 55%. The free-market thinkers that inspired Thatcher said that raising the share of national income going to capital was long overdue. By the 1970s, it was said, decades of full employment had allowed trade unions to get an excessive share of national output, leaving too little left over for firms to spend on new plant and machinery. The theory was that a rising profit share would lead to higher investment, faster productivity and more well-paid jobs. Suffice it to say, this has not happened. In countries such as the US and the UK, the stock of fixed capital is lower than it was in the mid-1980s, according to last week\u2019s report by the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad). Labour\u2019s falling income share is correlated with declining trade union membership and a much smaller proportion of the workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements. But it has certainly not been correlated with rising investment. Why has labour\u2019s share been falling? As the Unctad report notes, \u201cthe proximate cause has been wage repression, which has prevented wages from keeping pace with the cost of living and increases in productivity. \u201cThe deeper, more fundamental factors have included decreasing unionisation rates, the erosion of social security, growing market concentration and the spread of outsourcing through global value chains.\u201d Life has become more difficult for workers, who have been faced with a loss of bargaining power and the proliferation of precarious jobs, but a lot easier for employers. In practice, the much-vaunted flexible labour market means that only when unemployment falls to exceptionally low levels does it become possible for workers to seize the whip hand. For the rest of the time, the economic model of the past four decades means a growing share of household income is financed by borrowing, while the increase in the profit share has either been saved or channelled into buying assets. John McDonnell\u2019s speech to last week\u2019s Labour conference posed a challenge to this flawed model, although its impact was drowned out by the party\u2019s debate on its Brexit stance happening on the same day. To the extent that there was any commentary, it was that Labour was intent on turning the clock back to the 1970s. To the extent that McDonnell wants to make it a more even fight between capital and labour so that workers earn a bigger share of what they produce, this is true. But there was nothing revolutionary about either of the two big economic themes of his speech. The first was that the state must be prepared to invest if the private sector is unable or reluctant to do so. Capital is plentiful, interest rates are at historic lows, Britain\u2019s infrastructure is badly in need of modernisation. Yet, businesses would rather sit on piles of cash or use profits to buy back shares rather than seize the plentiful investment opportunities. The fact that this tendency long predates Brexit suggests a need for the state to take the initiative in the hope that public investment will encourage private investment. McDonnell\u2019s second theme was the need to raise labour\u2019s share of national income in a variety of ways: by raising the national living wage to a minimum of \u00a310 an hour, a shorter working week with no loss of pay, and by rolling back the trade union legislation introduced by the Conservatives since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s election in 1979.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a bullish performance, Johnson said repeatedly that the public are weary of Brexit and just want to get it done \u2013 the slogan of this year\u2019s autumn conference.</p> \n<p>He said there was still a chance of reaching a deal with the EU but that efforts were not helped by the Benn Act, which compels him to ask for a Brexit extension if he has not struck a deal by 19 October.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cObviously the chances of a deal or no deal depend very much on the common sense of our friends and partners.

The fact that very few journalists, let alone millions of others, know of his death in August 2017 is a tragedy behind a tragedy.</p> <p>For Allen was a young reporter and photographer who, despite his inexperience, produced enough work to suggest he was going to make a special contribution to our trade. He wrote sensitively, almost poetically, from three conflict zones \u2013 Ukraine, Turkey and Sudan \u2013 while taking illuminating photographs and shooting videos.</p> <p>So, how and why did Allen die? And why has his case received so little coverage?</p> <p>Asking these basic questions brings into focus the increased risk of modern war reporting. Too often now, with big news organisations having left the field, it is freelancers who report from the frontlines. Yet, should they die, there is less of a media storm about their deaths than is usually the case for staffers.</p> <p>Less media noise means less pressure on the relevant authorities to act. Consequently, there are too few proper investigations into journalists killed in the line of duty. It is becoming clear that over the past few years, there has been a growing acceptance that reporters and photographers, whether staff or freelancers, can be killed with impunity when covering conflicts. Allen\u2019s case is therefore emblematic of the current situation.</p> <p>Ever since he was killed, his parents, relatives and friends have been seeking an investigation into his death but have been thwarted by a mixture of official apathy in Britain, bureaucratic inertia in the United States and bloody-mindedness in South Sudan.</p> <p>Allen, who held British and American nationality, was 26 when he died in South Sudan\u2019s civil war. He was embedded with a group of rebels belonging to the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition when they launched an attack on the government-held town of Kaya, near the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. </p> <p>According to initial reports, he was the victim of crossfire. This version of events was soon discounted because he was shot five times by government soldiers in the apparent belief that he was a \u201cwhite rebel\u201d. Could they have mistaken his camera for a weapon? It would seem highly unlikely and the Associated Press journalist Sam Mednick <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2019-04-12-00-parents-of-slain-journalist-demand-justice-from-south-sudan\" title=\"\">later interviewed soldiers who admitted they knew Allen was carrying a camera and shot him all the same</a>. In other words, he was targeted as a journalist.</p> <p>What happened immediately afterwards also calls into question the motive behind his shooting. Pictures taken of his clothed body were followed by images of him stripped naked as a form of humiliation, which were then posted on social media. These were taken down after the intervention of US diplomats.</p> <p>South Sudan has refused all calls to hold an investigation. And a chance for Britain to hold an inquest into Allen\u2019s death was missed when his body arrived at Heathrow en route to the US. That oversight is surely one of the consequences of there being too little publicity about the killing by British media.</p> <p>As for the US, Allen\u2019s family called for an investigation by the FBI because his suspected targeting as a journalist would amount to a war crime. So far, nothing has come of it, nor of attempts to persuade the United Nations to get involved.</p> <p>But his parents, Joyce Krajian and John Allen, who live in the US, are fighting on. In a joint email to me, they said: \u201cWe must find justice for Christopher\u2019s tragically short but well-lived life, thereby ensuring a safer world for journalists who report from conflict zones in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Allen\u2019s London-based film-maker cousin, Jeremy Bliss, is also pressing for action. In <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/opinion/christopher-allen-sudan-impunity.php\" title=\"\">a moving piece for the Columbia Journalism Review last month</a>, he wrote: \u201cAt a time when journalism is more dangerous than ever, impunity only fuels threats against reporters such as Christopher.\u201d</p> <p>The case has been taken up by the global press freedom organisation, Reporters Without Borders, whose UK director, Rebecca Vincent, said: \u201cThe failure of the US and UK governments and the UN to act meaningfully for the better part of two years is nothing short of shameful, and we call on them to remedy this inaction now. When we campaign for justice for Christopher, we are also campaigning for the protection of journalists everywhere, and to ensure that our own governments never again allow this to happen when journalists are targeted abroad.\u201d</p> <p>A London law firm, Doughty Street Chambers, has also offered support to the Allen family. One of its barristers, Caoilfhionn Gallagher, points out that there is probable cause to suspect Allen suffered from a double war crime. The first, his killing for being a journalist, was compounded by the second: the outrage on his personal dignity by subjecting his body to humiliating and degrading treatment.</p> <p>She said: \u201cA journalist, whether embedded with an armed group or not, falls within the definition of a civilian and is entitled to protection. Journalists who bear witness to armed conflict are both exercising their own fundamental rights to freedom of expression, and performing a public service.\u201d</p> <p>Allen was determined to be a witness to conflict. In explaining his motivation for covering conflict, he said: \u201cIt is better to be on the frontlines of history rather than in a library studying it.\u201d To that end, in 2014, Allen went to eastern Ukraine and came across the debris of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down by pro-Russia separatists and cost the lives of all 298 people onboard. His video and report, which reveal a talent for description, were published by the Daily Telegraph, giving him his first newspaper byline.</p> <p>Later articles for American outlets showed an increasing development of his writing and photography skills. After <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10977410/MH17-A-scene-of-horror-death-and-the-banalities-of-life-together-in-a-Ukrainian-field.html\" title=\"\">a lengthy stay in </a><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10977410/MH17-A-scene-of-horror-death-and-the-banalities-of-life-together-in-a-Ukrainian-field.html\" title=\"\">Ukraine</a>, he went to Turkey, where he was embedded with Kurdish militia, before he made his way to Africa and South Sudan.</p> <p>His mother said: \u201cChristopher had a desire to bring to light untold stories from uncovered and under-covered regions of the world, to show the plight of their peoples. He dedicated himself to covering what he felt were invisible wars.\u201d</p> <p>But Allen\u2019s death should not be invisible. To let it pass without a rigorous investigation is to sanction the impunity of the killing of journalists.</p>",

Ever since he was killed, his parents, relatives and friends have been seeking an investigation into his death but have been thwarted by a mixture of official apathy in Britain, bureaucratic inertia in the United States and bloody-mindedness in South Sudan. Allen, who held British and American nationality, was 26 when he died in South Sudan\u2019s civil war. He was embedded with a group of rebels belonging to the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition when they launched an attack on the government-held town of Kaya, near the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. According to initial reports, he was the victim of crossfire. This version of events was soon discounted because he was shot five times by government soldiers in the apparent belief that he was a \u201cwhite rebel\u201d. Could they have mistaken his camera for a weapon? It would seem highly unlikely and the Associated Press journalist Sam Mednick later interviewed soldiers who admitted they knew Allen was carrying a camera and shot him all the same. In other words, he was targeted as a journalist. What happened immediately afterwards also calls into question the motive behind his shooting. Pictures taken of his clothed body were followed by images of him stripped naked as a form of humiliation, which were then posted on social media. These were taken down after the intervention of US diplomats. South Sudan has refused all calls to hold an investigation. And a chance for Britain to hold an inquest into Allen\u2019s death was missed when his body arrived at Heathrow en route to the US. That oversight is surely one of the consequences of there being too little publicity about the killing by British media. As for the US, Allen\u2019s family called for an investigation by the FBI because his suspected targeting as a journalist would amount to a war crime. So far, nothing has come of it, nor of attempts to persuade the United Nations to get involved. But his parents, Joyce Krajian and John Allen, who live in the US, are fighting on. In a joint email to me, they said: \u201cWe must find justice for Christopher\u2019s tragically short but well-lived life, thereby ensuring a safer world for journalists who report from conflict zones in the future.\u201d Allen\u2019s London-based film-maker cousin, Jeremy Bliss, is also pressing for action. In a moving piece for the Columbia Journalism Review last month, he wrote: \u201cAt a time when journalism is more dangerous than ever, impunity only fuels threats against reporters such as Christopher.\u201d The case has been taken up by the global press freedom organisation, Reporters Without Borders, whose UK director, Rebecca Vincent, said: \u201cThe failure of the US and UK governments and the UN to act meaningfully for the better part of two years is nothing short of shameful, and we call on them to remedy this inaction now. When we campaign for justice for Christopher, we are also campaigning for the protection of journalists everywhere, and to ensure that our own governments never again allow this to happen when journalists are targeted abroad.\u201d A London law firm, Doughty Street Chambers, has also offered support to the Allen family. One of its barristers, Caoilfhionn Gallagher, points out that there is probable cause to suspect Allen suffered from a double war crime. The first, his killing for being a journalist, was compounded by the second: the outrage on his personal dignity by subjecting his body to humiliating and degrading treatment. She said: \u201cA journalist, whether embedded with an armed group or not, falls within the definition of a civilian and is entitled to protection. Journalists who bear witness to armed conflict are both exercising their own fundamental rights to freedom of expression, and performing a public service.\u201d Allen was determined to be a witness to conflict. In explaining his motivation for covering conflict, he said: \u201cIt is better to be on the frontlines of history rather than in a library studying it.\u201d To that end, in 2014, Allen went to eastern Ukraine and came across the debris of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down by pro-Russia separatists and cost the lives of all 298 people onboard. His video and report, which reveal a talent for description, were published by the Daily Telegraph, giving him his first newspaper byline. Later articles for American outlets showed an increasing development of his writing and photography skills. After a lengthy stay in Ukraine, he went to Turkey, where he was embedded with Kurdish militia, before he made his way to Africa and South Sudan. His mother said: \u201cChristopher had a desire to bring to light untold stories from uncovered and under-covered regions of the world, to show the plight of their peoples. He dedicated himself to covering what he felt were invisible wars.\u201d But Allen\u2019s death should not be invisible. To let it pass without a rigorous investigation is to sanction the impunity of the killing of journalists.",

      "bodyText": "Voting is under way in elections in Austria that could result in the former chancellor Sebastian Kurz renewing a controversial pact with the far right to reclaim his position as the world\u2019s youngest state leader. The conservative-nationalist coalition government collapsed in May after the emergence of a covertly filmed video in which the then deputy chancellor and Freedom party (FP\u00d6) leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, offered lucrative public contracts in exchange for campaign support to a woman purporting to be the niece of a Russian oligarch. But with Strache banished from office, the FP\u00d6 headed by two new leaders and the 33-year-old Kurz emerging from the scandal largely unscathed, a renewed alliance between the two parties remains on the cards. Now led by the hardline former interior minister Herbert Kickl and the former presidential candidate Norbert Hofer, the FP\u00d6 has openly rallied for a reunion with Kurz\u2019s Austrian People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP). Its campaign video shows Hofer readjusting a portrait of the youthful former chancellor to stop it \u201ctilting to the left\u201d. The latest polls predict Kurz\u2019s \u00d6VP emerging as the strongest force with about 33% of the vote, followed by the centre-left Social Democratic party (SP\u00d6) on 22% and the FP\u00d6 on 20%. The Austrian Green party, which in 2017 failed to get over the 4% threshold for the first time since 1983, has polled at about 13%, fuelling speculation Kurz could opt for a three-way alliance with it and the pro-business, liberal NEOS party. A \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with the centre-left SP\u00d6, which has been the norm for much of the period since the second world war, has come to be associated with political stasis and infighting and would sit uneasily with Kurz\u2019s reformist agenda. About 6.4 million Austrians are eligible to vote until 5pm local time (1600 BST), when voting booths close and the first exit polls will be published. The first official results will be published at about 9pm local time.",

It\u2019s another of those clashes that you just feel might have huge ramifications on the knockout stages of the tournament, but there are plenty of possible upsets still to come in Pool D before anyone starts gazing too deeply into the crystal ball.</p> \n  <p>Wales controlled early field position and punished Australia with an brilliantly-executed kicking game - not just the twin drop goals but the inch-perfect kick for Parkes\u2019 try.</p> \n  <p>Both Michaels Cheika and Hooper arguing the toss on some of the calls during their post-match interviews - the Australian coach particularly incensed by certain scrum penalties against his side, but as is the way with modern rugby, so many of the key calls were open to rival interpretations.<br></p> \n  <p>For their part, as they did against Fiji, Australia finished the game very strongly. It will be something to watch for rival nations, the power with which they rolled over the Welsh side - that had run out to a fifteen point lead at half-time - to reduce the arrears to just one point.</p> \n  <p>Lead by talismanic skipper Alun Wyn Jones in his record-equally 130th cap, the Welsh forwards showed too much experience, riding out the golden storm in the last ten minutes. </p> \n  <p>Australia had their chances to win - they did not capitalise. Wales took their opportunities, and they emerged with the potentially crucial victory.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9081128f08fbb0c171d7f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T10:04:05.059Z\">11.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here\u2019s Robert Kitson - our eyes at the stadium with his full-time assessment: </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/29/rugby-world-cup-wales-australia-comeback-pool-d-report\">Wales cling on in face of Australia comeback to edge brilliant Pool D clash</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9080ae8f08fbb0c171d7f1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T10:01:39.256Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>One of our Guardian rugby correspondents Bret Harris has written in:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It looks like Michael cheikas master plan falling apart.

      "bodyText": "A hum-dinger in the end, in Tokyo. It\u2019s another of those clashes that you just feel might have huge ramifications on the knockout stages of the tournament, but there are plenty of possible upsets still to come in Pool D before anyone starts gazing too deeply into the crystal ball. Wales controlled early field position and punished Australia with an brilliantly-executed kicking game - not just the twin drop goals but the inch-perfect kick for Parkes\u2019 try. Both Michaels Cheika and Hooper arguing the toss on some of the calls during their post-match interviews - the Australian coach particularly incensed by certain scrum penalties against his side, but as is the way with modern rugby, so many of the key calls were open to rival interpretations. For their part, as they did against Fiji, Australia finished the game very strongly. It will be something to watch for rival nations, the power with which they rolled over the Welsh side - that had run out to a fifteen point lead at half-time - to reduce the arrears to just one point. Lead by talismanic skipper Alun Wyn Jones in his record-equally 130th cap, the Welsh forwards showed too much experience, riding out the golden storm in the last ten minutes. Australia had their chances to win - they did not capitalise. Wales took their opportunities, and they emerged with the potentially crucial victory. And here\u2019s Robert Kitson - our eyes at the stadium with his full-time assessment: One of our Guardian rugby correspondents Bret Harris has written in: It looks like Michael cheikas master plan falling apart. Wales playing smart. Wallabies making dumb mistakes. Wallabies whingeing about refereeing backfiring. Cheika made shock changes to team that beat Fiji. Was part of a long term plan but team lacking cohesion. Look confused at times. It\u2019s a tough assessment - do you agree with that, Australian supporters? For the Welsh, plays like the opening minute drop goals in both halves were too smart, too calm. Their tryline defence was immense - when do you see three consecutive rolling mauls defended from a tier one nation? It\u2019s a relieved and appreciative captain, Alun Wyn Jones, who is interviewed post-game. He knows his side was in a battle today, but what confidence will they draw from that performance - especially with the influential Dan Biggar out of the contest so early on after that courageous try-stopping tackle on the human wrecking ball Samu Kerevi. My emails are lighting up with (presumably) southern hemisphere fans with accusations of northern hemisphere bias against referee Romain Poite. Look. There were some little calls here and there (and I\u2019ll confess to momentary frustration over one or two myself) but it\u2019s hard to suggest on the balance of play that Wales did not deserve that win. For Australia, there were patches of mercurial brilliance, but far too many sloppy errors, poor decisions and head-scratching plays. You cannot miss touch with a penalty in the championship minutes, you cannot throw intercept passes, you cannot drop the ball cold. Whew! Take a breath. Raise a glass, Welsh fans - what a dramatic victory, and what another pulsating clash we\u2019ve seen already at the Japanese World Cup. South Africa v New Zealand, France v Argentina, Japan v Ireland, and now - Wales v Australia. That\u2019s some high quality pool-stage drama. The gong sounds. The men in red have farmed it brilliantly at the death - they kick to touch, and hold on for a miraculous victory! What a dramatic conclusion to a pulsating game of rugby, and on the balance of play, you\u2019d have to say, perhaps a fair result. 79 min: There\u2019s about thirty seconds to play, and Wales have turned it over!! A runner got isolated, and the men in red and running it down. 78 min: It\u2019s a Welsh lineout feed, about 25-3om out from their line. The men in red win the ball, but somehow Australia have turned it over! They look to set something up, building the phases. They\u2019re about 20m out Australia. 77 min: And now a penalty against Wales, for standing in the scrum. Australia look for touch - but it\u2019s brilliantly kept in by Wales! That was like the fielder that skips the four rope to flick back to a colleague and prevent a six. Excellent from Wales - but how Australia missed touch at such a crucial point in the game! 75 min: We reset for a scrum. Romain Poite holds court, but an increasingly frustrated Australian forward pack rues the lost seconds at this stage of the match. Penalty against Australia for hitting early in the contact. Great experience from Wales\u2019 forwards. They\u2019re locking the clock up brilliantly after a long period of Australian dominance in this second half. 74 min: We set for a scrum - a reminder that it\u2019s France, Argentina or England awaiting these teams, should they qualify from Pool D - with the top spot proving crucial if a presumptive clash with England is to be avoided. 73 min: Australia look to spread wide, but it\u2019s Beale who adjudged to have thrown a forward pass! A key error from the Wallabies\u2019 experienced fullback. Patchell just creeps it inside the post - what a key kick that was! He\u2019s been very good since Biggar\u2019s early concussion. We\u2019re back outside a 3-point margin. But there\u2019s still eight minutes to play. Real championship minutes, these. 70 min: Great claim from Tipuric, and they earn a penalty for Rodda jumping across in the lineout! Patchell looks for the crossfield bomb - and again North out-jumps Koroibete. Didn\u2019t this bloke play in the NRL? It\u2019s a prodigious leap the Welshman has on him - but he can\u2019t plant it cleanly on this occasion. He gets to his feet gingerly, hopefully no injury for North, he\u2019s been one of Wales\u2019 best today. 68 min: Penalty against Australia as Rodda attempts the chargedown - but his compatriot Kepu is pinged for offside. Wales kick to touch, it\u2019s a good opportunity for some attacking possession. We haven\u2019t seen much of this for the men in red in this second half. 66 min: Penalty against Wales - an infringement in the scrum, and Toomua says, I\u2019ll have a look at the three points. What a see-sawing match this is turning into! Great drama. Toomua strikes it nicely, and having trailed by 15, Australia are now just a solitary point behind. What a huge final fourteen minutes to play! 65 min: There\u2019s been a big swing of momentum in this game. Australia were by and large a little disjointed and lacked cohesion in that first forty, but they\u2019re looking a much better prospect after the break. Wales for their part appear to have gone into their shell a little in the past 10 minutes. A knock on by Wales, and they\u2019re starting to look under pressure. 64 min: Australia dart down the right, it\u2019s Haylett-Petty with a chip and chase after White\u2019s fine run. It\u2019s not a great connection and the kick gives him everything to do - but it\u2019s a gold knock on. A much-needed breather for both squads, but with Australia ascendent, you\u2019d imagine the Welsh forward pack enjoy it more. They set the scrum, win it, and then clear their lines with a thumping kick upfield. 62 min: Ooph. Is that over? Hooper pops up under the sticks, claiming it. That was pure muscle from both sides. Such incredible defence from Wales, but the gold No 7 eventually finds a way. Toomua with the kick from in front, we\u2019re back to a four-point game! 60 min: Latu feeds, Australia set up the maul, but it goes nowhere. They spin wide and Hooper\u2019s eyes light up. Sio looks to pick and drive - they\u2019re a metre short of the line, Australia. This is courageous stuff - they\u2019re inching ever so closer, the Wallabies - can they find a way over? 58 min: It\u2019s a better claim and they set up the maul once more, Australia, but again the Welsh wall remains unbreachable. Excellent defence. They look to pick and drive, the Wallabies. Wales penalised for offside, great rugby this. Incredible defensive effort - but it\u2019s set to continue. Australia go to another lineout. 57 min: Australia with a lineout in a promising area - big opportunity here. They set up the maul, but the Welsh defend brilliantly - no forward momentum there. Toomua looks crossfield for Haylett-Petty with the kick, but he\u2019s overhit it and it sails into touch. We come back for a penalty. Do they take the three? No, they\u2019ve elected to kick for touch. 55 min: Genia makes way for Nic White, meanwhile just two replacements since the break so far from Wales, Wyn Jones and Wainwright making way for Nicky Smith and Ross Moriarty. 54 min: Scrum feed for Wales, after another turnover. It\u2019s won by the men in red before a huge tackle from Hooper bundles the runner, Gareth Davies into touch! Huge work from the Australia skipper, you sense he\u2019s a little frustrated out there. Matthew Dony writes in: Lovely shot of Nicky Wire in the crowd reacting to that drop goal. He\u2019s already writing lyrics about it... Look, I\u2019ll confess I have no idea who that is, but we cater to all audiences here at the Guardian play-by-play. 52 min: Genia looks to shift wide, they\u2019re building phases Australia as they move around 10m out from the Welsh line. One of the first times all game any side has build ten phases. But they butcher it, Australia! O\u2019Connor tries to pop the short pass and he\u2019s given Koroibete little chance to hold that. 51 min: In the interest of avoiding more talking points - we\u2019ll just say if you give the penalty against Kerevi, then you give the penalty against Adams, as Romain Poite has there, as the winger is accused of going a little high in the tackle. All we can ask is consistency, so fair play to the refereeing team. 50 min: Australia with a chance to build some momentum - but it\u2019s Gareth Davies who rushes out of the line once again, and he almost takes a miraculous intercept! So close for Wales, a terrific read from the scrum half, he was unfortunate not to hold that. Brilliant anticipation. 47 min: It\u2019s a huge early replacement from Cheika as Foley is sacrificed, and Toomua has immediate effect. Kurtley Beale enters the fray in place of Ashley-Cooper. Is it a concession that not all of the coaches\u2019 shuffles worked? 45 min: Toomua with a half break, before Haylett-Petty makes a bust. He looks inside for Toomua again. They\u2019re about a metre short of the line - some desperate tryline defence from the Welsh. But it\u2019s Pocock who draws two defenders before finding the fullback outside him once again. A fine flowing move - is that a lifeline for Australia? Toomua lines up the conversion. Straight over the black dot, he adds two. 42 min: It\u2019s a very good carry as Wales burst down the wing, and now they look to build through the centre. They\u2019re about 15m out, and they set up nicely - it\u2019s passed back to Patchell, and he slots it! We talked all about the meticulous kicking game of Biggar, but it\u2019s his replacement getting it done for Wales. What a start to the second half - just as they started the first! 41 min: It\u2019s a very fine carry from Latu who gets some forward momentum for Australia, but it\u2019s a cold drop from Foley who causes the turnover. Wales to set for a scrum. Second half! 40 min: Still, time and tide wait for no man - and we recommence! What can Australia come up with to try and salvage this match. And is it conceivable that this very reliably Welsh side will allow them any glimmers of hope to get back into the contest? Well, it\u2019s a game of opinions and there\u2019s plenty of divergence from you, the good readers, on both the Hooper/Biggar incident and Kerevi v Patchell: David Sweet has written in: Kerevi\u2019s not meant to hold his hands - and head - in a way that put the opponent at risk of a smashed windpipe. People used to hold the ball around the ribcage/solar plexus. There\u2019s absolutely no reason to hold it that high. As the commentators remarked, the player himself knows he\u2019s lucky to still be on the pitch. I don\u2019t accept the \u201che took his mouthguard out therefore he knew he was about to get a yellow card\u201d line - players do that on most long breaks in play to regain their breath. But I think many would agree with the rest of that statement, David. Minor turning points aside, it\u2019s hard to argue that Wales have been the better side across that first 40. It\u2019s the hoary chestnut of inconsistency in decisions that makes rugby fans around the world explode, though. And I imagine there are many supporters in gold still feeling a little aggrieved about losing Hodge for three weeks for an incident that should have been dealt with in-game. Some half-time reading from the earlier Pool D clash: Some warning signs there for Fiji and Australia - they\u2019ve bounced back very well from their opening round trouncing, Georgia. And there\u2019s the gong. What a morale-sapping end to the half for those in gold, as Wales finish the half as they started it. It\u2019s not a mountain to climb, but it\u2019s just outside two converted tries the difference. With runners like Kerevi Australia are always a chance for a try, but two? It could be very difficult from here, you\u2019d imagine. Oh my. I said it was a big ten minutes, and it\u2019s Wales who are playing the championship minutes so much better. Genia throws a chancey one, and it\u2019s plucked out of the air by Davies who\u2019s far too quick, and he sprints away for the try! Extras added by Patchell once again - it\u2019s blown out to a massive 16-point margin! It\u2019s Patchell from long-range and it hooks left - it clatters the post, and it bounces off and just over! Just, but it\u2019s enough - and they claim the three. 36 min: Oh my. We\u2019re coming back for another TMO, with Kerevi accused of leading with the forearm. My days. Do these blokes get paid by the minute for how long they can interrupt the flow of a match? It\u2019s a penalty against Australia. Honestly, I don\u2019t know what Kerevi\u2019s meant to do there - he has his hands raised to protect the ball and Satchell comes in too high in the tackle. It\u2019s arms to chest, that rise for a secondary, indirect contact to the head. Hooper argues the toss with Poite \u201cthat\u2019s just terrible tackle technique\u201d - he\u2019s not the most loveable in world rugby, but it\u2019s hard to argue with that assessment. 35 min: Good work from Wales, they rush out of the line and pressure O\u2019Connor and it\u2019s ball to ground. There\u2019s talk of \u201cgreasy conditions\u201d, which means a first reference to Warren Gatland and baby oil (drink!) 33 min: O\u2019Connor thumps downfield. No Reece Hodge, obviously, how much will they miss his booming kicking game today. We set for an Australian lineout - it\u2019s won and Kerevi bumps the first tackler again. What a game he\u2019s having. Ach, a poor pass out of the halves from Foley, but Hooper scrabbles to retain. They pick and drive, but Wales are defending well. No mistake, Patchell. A fair reward for his brilliant hands under pressure moments earlier. A lot of people who have come off the bench would have looked up a little with a gold freight-train running at them, but he took the hit, retained the ball, and ultimately it ends in points for Wales, once again. 30 min: A big ten minutes to close this half. Owens with a lineout feed, which Wales win but it\u2019s a poor pass out of the halves and Patchell does very well to pick up off his bootlaces. They build the phases, the Welsh continue to probe, and it\u2019s Hooper who\u2019s eventually penalised for coming in over the top. No Biggar, who\u2019s off for an HIH after that mammoth tackle on Kerevi. Patchell will line up for a shot at three. Foley slots it from 10m in from touch. It floats a little ugly, but it flies between the sticks, which is the main thing for Wallabies supporters. And having been largely second-best, Australia have drawn themselves back into this one, in part due to the strong running of Kerevi, and some great work at set piece, both scrum and lineout. 26 min: Australia push wide, and it\u2019s George North who gives away a penalty. They play on, and it\u2019s Kerevi with another monster run - he drops the goose step and palms off a would-be tackler, before Biggar comes across with a crucial try-saving tackle! We come back for the penalty. 24 min: It\u2019s some sustained possession for Wales who continue to look dangerous in attack. Kerevi just does enough defensively, but we set for another lineout. But it\u2019s deflected towards the men in gold! A huge lineout pinch. Some more predictions trickling in: While Phil Withall chimes in: It\u2019s a fair point, Phil. We saw Australia play a little too exuberantly to start against Fiji, before returning to a more composed form of rugby. Will we see the same again, today? 20 min: It\u2019s a good scrum from Australia - they win the penalty and get out of danger (for now). Kerevi with another big carry, before Foley looks crossfield with the kick, and it\u2019s the veteran, Mr 120 (ish?) caps in for the five-pointer! And now the conversion. Oh my. That\u2019s awful from Foley - has he clipped the tee? No distance, and it dips wide. Points left on the field. This could prove crucial for the Wallabies. Alastair Connor writes in: Hi Richard. As A Kiwi living in France, I\u2019m divided as to who I support. As a NZer, I would naturally back Satan\u2019s XV against Aus, but as a new Frenchman, I would marginally prefer Wales in the semis. It goes without saying (shh) that England will beat us in the group match. Cheers! A good point though - I forgot to mention in the build up that this match has potentially huge ramifications for what comes later in the tournament - and that team, England, looms very large for whoever loses this one today. 18 min: Wales kick to touch and set the lineout - but its pinched! Good response, from the men in gold. Wales keep the defensive runner up, and the maul goes nowhere. It\u2019s another turnover! 17 min: It\u2019s been a lively start from French referee Romain Poite, who is calling the play back for an alleged late tackle by Michael Hooper. Goodness gracious. If we\u2019re going to stop rugby games to come back for incidents like this, we may as well just make the halves 60 minutes. No card, but it\u2019s a penalty to Wales. 16 min: Liam Williams returns and drives a thumping kick 60m down field. Koroibete returns like a wind-up clock-cum-fridge. Wales now on the attack, Wainwright with some big metres midfield, they push left but run out of real estate. Biggar looks for another drop goal - it sails the distance.. but it\u2019s wide! 14 min: Welly, well. First close up of Cheika in the coaches box. Watch that gently simmer over the next 64 minutes, at this rate. Australia with ball in hand about 10m into the Welsh half. Kerevi with a solid run, and he bumps off his opposite number. But it\u2019s the skipper Hooper who drops it, again! 11 min: Penalty Wales! The scrum collapses, Australia accused of angling. Welsh lineout about 20m out. They go deep and it\u2019s North on the run once again. A few phases, but Australia\u2019s defence picks out the one-off runners. Biggar kicks to the corner, and it\u2019s Parkes who rises above Koroibete to pluck the crossfield bomb and place it! Lovely from Biggar. And he converts well from the touchline. Fine kick, Biggar. 9 min: Wales look to spread, but it\u2019s a forward pass. A poor turnover - they\u2019ve started by far the brighter, the World Number 3 side. We set for another scrum, Australia\u2019s feed, just shy of halfway. 7 min: But it\u2019s a double knock-on! Wales first, and Australia\u2019s line remains intact. They showed some southern hemisphere running rugby there, Wales, but only desperate defence brought North down, as the try line was within sight. They set the scrum, and Australia wins before Genia clears their lines. 5 min: Wales with a lineout feed, Tipuric is raised and claims, Haylett-Petty takes the kick well and returns with some good metres. Kerevi almosts breaks the line but he\u2019s held, just, by the shorts elastics! Foley throws a speculator - and it\u2019s intercepted - too easy for Wales. Now it\u2019s the men in red who spread wide! They\u2019re pulled down 10m short of the line. 4 min: Penalty missed! Mine eyes! Biggar from near the touchline, but he slots it just to the left. A let off for Australia. 6-0 could have been a harsh start. 2 min: Haylett-Petty almost breaks the line, but he can\u2019t maintain control and ball goes to ground. Wales advance, and it\u2019s a penalty against Australia - Ashley-Cooper accused of being off his feet. Hello! What a way to start - the first possession, and they pinch it, and the man with 10 on his back slots it sweet as a nut! First points, first blood Wales. 1 min: And it\u2019s Biggar\u2019s boot that starts us, and he kicks deep and targets Hooper. And there\u2019s an early turn over! Wales with ball in hand about 30m out, what can they come up with. And there\u2019s the anthems - belted out with gusto. More red than yellow in the crowd, you\u2019d argue perhaps. But irrespective of who you\u2019re supporting, this is going to be an absolute cracker. A prediction in early from Andrew Battershill: Australia are smarter than Wales. They will outscore by 2 clear tries, with a win by 3-6 points. Ooph. A more confident man then me, I believe Andrew. I\u2019m leaning Welsh composure for this one. And Biggar\u2019s boot. But what a game we have in store, either way. As Alun Wyn Jones leads the men in red onto the pitch for a record 130th time - kickoff\u2019s not far away, as the players emerge to a chorus of drums and gongs. Superb atmosphere. So - the danger men today? The areas where it will be won and lost? Breakdown: Hooper and Pocock. What solutions do Wales have to stop the dynamic duo? Kicking: Leali\u2019ifano\u2019s profligacy from the set piece could be a part factor to his dropping out of the side, while Foley comes in as a man in, let\u2019s be fair, pretty scratchy form. Whereas Biggar on the other hand? You run out of panegyrics for a guy who performs under pressure as regularly as Wales\u2019 No 10. Settled side v horses for courses: There\u2019s no doubting Wales are a solid, cohesive unit. They know each others\u2019 game and they can rely on the man next to them. But Australia? It\u2019s a new halves pair again - albeit the experienced duo of Foley and Genia - and shifts at fullback and wing. They should still be well-drilled, but if anything goes wrong early, it could drive a wobble or two. If you need a quick refresh of how the pools are placed at the end of this morning\u2019s Georgia v Uruguay clash: And if you missed Paul Ree\u2019s preview for today\u2019s huge cross-hemisphere-battle, cast your eyes over this: So, without ado, to team news. It\u2019s an unchanged fifteen for Wales: Wales: (15-1) 15 L Williams; 14 North, 13 Jonathan Davies, 12 Parkes, 11 Adams; 10 Biggar, 9 G Davies; 8 Navidi, 7 Tipuric, 6 Wainwright, 5 Alun Wyn Jones (c), 4 Ball, 3 Francis, 2 Owens, 1 Wyn Jones. Bench: 16 Smith, 17 Dee, 18 Lewis, 19 Shingler, 20 Moriarty, 21 T Williams, 22 Patchell, 23 Watkin. While for Australia it\u2019s a dramatic mix-up from Michael Cheika - with four changes (yes, four). Genia and Foley return to the halves, a suspension-enforced reshuffle as Reece Hodge drops out for Haylett-Petty, with Michael Cheika also wielding the axe on Kurtley Beale. The defensive presence of veteran Adam Ashley-Cooper preferred instead. Australia: (15-1) 15 Haylett-Petty; 14 Ashley-Cooper, 13 O\u2019Connor, 12 Kerevi, 11 Koroibete; 10 Foley, 9 Genia; 8 Naisarani, 7 Hooper (c), 6 Pocock, 5 Arnold, 4 Rodda, 3 Alaalatoa, 2 Latu, 1 Sio. Bench: 16 Uelese, 17 Slipper, 18 Kepu, 19 Coleman, 20 Salakaia-Loto, 21 White, 22 To\u2019omua, 23 Beale. Fresh news from the earlier Pool D clash, where Uruguay\u2019s Los Teros were unable to sustain their heroics against Fiji, going down 33-7 to Georgia. A strong result for a proud rugby nation that keeps their progression hopes alive. At the very least it shows they\u2019ll be highly competitive with Fiji and Australia to come. We\u2019ll have a match report on that one, shortly. Hi all! Salutations to you and yours from wherever around the world you\u2019re following our coverage. Is it the seaside town of Borth or the fabled national park Snowdonia, trying to chase the last rays of the northern hemisphere? Or perhaps anywhere on the scorched southern continent, where it appears there\u2019s no longer a concept such as winter. Wherever it is, please drop us a line to join the coverage - via email or tweet. Your predictions ahead of this one? We\u2019re all about quips, stats and insights here. Or maybe poetry? Get in touch. Australia v Wales. It\u2019s the battle of the Pool D heavyweights - with top spot presumably on the line. The key word there being presumably - as if we don\u2019t exist in a world in which Uruguay have beaten Fiji and Japan have stunningly shocked Ireland. It\u2019s already proving to be a topsy-turvy World Cup - what surprises lie in wait today? It was Jekyll and Hyde showings from both sides in their opening matches - Wales putting together one very good half, and one poor one against Georgia allowing late cheap points, with Australia trailing an impressive Fiji into the sheds, before returning to set piece and hard metres up the middle to get home comfortably. The last time these two clashed was the infamous 9-6 win in Cardiff last November, but before then it\u2019s a phenomenal run for Australia, who have won 13 on the spin against the Welsh. Can Wales continue to build on turning that run around? Or will the (briefly) World Number 1 side revert to old habits? Find out here, with Guardian\u2019s play-by-play coverage.",

      "bodyText": "Tom Watson has accused a \u201chard-left faction\u201d of jeopardising Labour\u2019s electoral chances by forcing MPs to waste time and effort on local selection battles, after Margaret Hodge became the second MP to face reselection. Hodge has vowed to campaign to remain Labour\u2019s candidate for Barking, after local members voted for her to face an open selection in the \u201ctrigger ballot\u201d process. Watson, the party\u2019s deputy leader, said on Sunday: \u201cOur professional organisers, constituency activists and MPs are spending an extraordinary amount of time on internal selections when they could be preparing for an imminent general election. \u201cI know the Jon Lansman-led hard-left faction on Labour\u2019s NEC are committed to full reselections but they risk Labour\u2019s chances of election success against Boris Johnson with their dogmatic behaviour.\u201d Hodge, a veteran MP and prominent critic of Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cI am obviously disappointed. My priority remains serving the people of Barking, as I have done for the last 25 years. At a vital time for the country, with a general election looming, we should be focusing our efforts on holding Boris Johnson and the Tories to account. \u201cI will work to secure the full backing of Barking Labour party, so I can continue to play my part as their MP in doing that.\u201d Labour sources insisted Hodge had not been targeted because of her role in criticising the party\u2019s response to antisemitism \u2013 and that many of those in Barking who supported an open selection were not from the left of the party. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to suggest this has anything to do with antisemitism. Many members wish to hold democratic selections so they can have a say in who represents them,\u201d said a party source. It has become easier for Labour members to force an open contest since the threshold was lowered at last year\u2019s party conference. In Barking, five out of 11 local branches supported an open selection. Momentum, the grassroots campaign group set up by Lansman to support Corbyn\u2019s leadership, would like to see all MPs face an open contest before each general election, believing it helps to hold MPs accountable and would bring new talent to Westminster. A Momentum spokesperson said: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to beat Boris Johnson and get Labour elected we need to open the door to a new generation of MPs drawn from Labour\u2019s half a million members. Inspiring candidates who know their communities and are committed to delivering a transformational policy agenda are a crucial part of Labour\u2019s plan to win, and Momentum will continue to support members in getting them selected.\u201d Lansman insisted \u201cthe left\u201d had had nothing to do with the trigger process in Barking, claiming it was driven by \u201cmembers on the right\u201d. Hodge has served as MP for Barking in east London since 1994 and a number of Labour MPs rallied behind her at the weekend. Stephen Doughty called her a \u201cbrilliant constituency MP\u201d and Tulip Siddiq said she was an \u201camazing feminist\u201d. The Hull North MP, Diana Johnson, who is widely respected at Westminster for campaigning on the contaminated blood scandal, is also facing an open selection. Hodge has led criticism of the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism complaints, confronting Corbyn directly about it and making a strongly worded speech about her experiences of antisemitism in a Commons debate. She beat the British National party in the 2010 general election and, in the same year, became the first woman to be elected chair of the public accounts committee. Mike Katz, the national chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said: \u201cMargaret Hodge has been a steadfast campaigner against racism, fascism and intolerance throughout her political life. \u201cShe saw off the BNP in Barking and has over the last few years been determined in her opposition to antisemitism within the Labour party. This is a shameful moment for a party which claims to embody the values of equality and diversity.\u201d The timetable for the trigger ballot process is set by the NEC, on which Corbyn\u2019s allies have a clear majority \u2013 though Lansman failed in a last-minute bid to abolish Watson\u2019s job just before last week\u2019s conference, because of objections by the chair, Wendy Nichols. Even MPs with little prospect of being deselected complain the process of rallying support among local members is time-consuming, with a general election potentially just months or weeks away. Thangam Debbonaire, the Bristol West MP, tweeted: \u201cThe sheer mass of work, time and energy spent trying to win on trigger ballots, or, if triggered, on the three-month open selection is all work, time and energy I think most people want us to be spending doing our jobs \u2013 challenging govt, developing Labour policy and trying to win general election.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has come under fire after it emerged she did not speak to Thomas Cook executives during increasingly frantic talks between the company and the government leading up to its collapse last week. Records of telephone calls and meetings, seen by the Guardian, indicate government ministers were aware the 178-year-old tour operator\u2019s finances had been deteriorating for months. But the documents show Leadsom and ministers and officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy had little to no discussion with the company about its ailing balance sheet until after it had entered liquidation. One source familiar with the relationship between the government and the company said BEIS, which oversees the response to business collapses such as those of Carillion and British Steel, \u201cdidn\u2019t want a meeting and didn\u2019t ask for one\u201d. Thomas Cook executives were instead told to speak to the Department for Transport (DfT), which orchestrated the repatriation of 150,000 UK citizens stranded overseas when the travel company went bust, but has limited experience of planning for corporate insolvencies. Asked how many times BEIS ministers or officials had met Thomas Cook over the past 12 months, a government spokesperson said: \u201cUK government officials meet with a range of businesses on a regular basis.\u201d The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: \u201cIt is appalling that the government has seemingly shirked its responsibility to Thomas Cook\u2019s workers and supply chain businesses. \u201cThe message this sends out is that it doesn\u2019t care about them, their families and the communities who will be hardest hit by the company\u2019s demise.\u201d Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the transport workers\u2019 union TSSA, said: \u201cJohnson said his government couldn\u2019t intervene to save Thomas Cook because this would create a \u2018moral hazard\u2019. It now appears that not only is he a zombie prime minister, but that he leads a cohort of ministers who\u2019re united only by their ineptitude and immorality.\u201d The union argued the government could have done more to keep parts of Thomas Cook alive or provide backing to encourage a private-sector rescue deal. The government has said investing in Thomas Cook would have been throwing good money after bad. Thomas Cook was placed in \u201cenhanced monitoring\u201d by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in November 2018 after its second profit warning in two months, triggering regular calls and meetings with the regulator as well as the DfT, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and aviation ministers. Since the company\u2019s collapse, BEIS has assumed a leading position in managing its insolvency, the fallout from one the UK\u2019s largest corporate failures, and the impact on staff and suppliers. Leadsom released details last week about her role in setting up a taskforce to assist those affected. The Insolvency Service, part of BEIS, is also managing the liquidation of Thomas Cook\u2019s assets, a delicate task after a collapse that cost 9,000 British employees their jobs. Leadsom wrote to the Insolvency Service in the immediate aftermath of Thomas Cook\u2019s failure, urging it to fast-track an investigation that would include the role of directors. But sources familiar with Thomas Cook\u2019s liquidation said the minister did not appear to be well briefed on the company or its finances. The records of talks between the regulator and ministers offer some insight into the increasingly frantic pace of discussions with the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, officials from DCMS, successive aviation ministers and the CAA. Thomas Cook\u2019s directors, including Sten Daugaard, the chief financial officer, met or spoke to the CAA on 16 occasions after the regulator enhanced its monitoring of the company due to the parlous state of its finances. The company\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, also met Shapps on 9 September, during a fortnight in which directors spoke to the DfT or the CAA on an almost daily basis. MPs are expected to question the company, regulators and ministers during an inquiry by the BEIS select committee next month. Fankhauser has blamed Thomas Cook\u2019s banks for pushing it over the edge. \u201cThe longer the talks dragged on, the more uncertainty grew, increasing the likelihood of a liquidity squeeze,\u201d he told the Sunday Times. \u201cHad we been quicker, we might not be in the situation we are now in.\u201d Thomas Cook had a balance sheet deficit of \u00a33.1bn when it collapsed and had rejected several offers for parts of the business, including its airline operation. The CAA expects to bring back another 15,00 Thomas Cook holidaymakers on Sunday. That would bring the total repatriated to 108,000, out of more than 150,000 who were abroad when the firm collapsed a week ago.",

The 3,300-acre site is the only family-owned and managed national nature reserve in the UK \u2013 Georgina Fulton, daughter of pioneering farmers and conservationists Philip and Corinne Merricks, runs it with husband Gareth \u2013 and it\u2019s the only one you can stay overnight. By day it welcomes walkers and birdwatchers; stay on, though, and you\u2019ll have it all practically to yourself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff96c611ebabc76d77d02c353a2bcb9b8121be15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff96c611ebabc76d77d02c353a2bcb9b8121be15/0_227_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bedroom at newly opened Elmley Farmhouse, with freestanding bath\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bedroom at newly opened Elmley Farmhouse</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Douglas/REBECCA DOUGLAS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We arrive late afternoon, via a bridge from the mainland \u2013 until the 1940s a ferry was the only way across. As islands go, Sheppey isn\u2019t a conventional beauty; a medley of marshland, industrial sprawl and holiday camps, it is the butt of many a Kent mainlander joke. But as soon as we turn into Elmley\u2019s two-mile driveway \u2013 made by Canadian soldiers garrisoned here during the second world war \u2013 I\u2019m bewitched by its empty, echoing charm and darting birdlife.</p> <p>There are six huts to stay in on the reserve. Made of sustainable wood or corrugated iron, with epic views and nice touches like hot-water bottles and chunky woollen throws (some have kitchenettes too), they are spread out to ensure privacy and full nature immersion. The reserve\u2019s 18th-century farmhouse is now open after renovation: marrying sweeping views of the reserve to a high-spec modern kitchen with glamorous vintage vibe, it can be rented in its entirety (sleeps 12, plus two children) or as individual rooms for B&amp;B stays during the week. There\u2019s a new cottage too, sleeping 10, with wraparound windows and a spacious living area. At the heart of the reserve is a beautiful 19th-century barn: popular for weddings, it also serves as a communal space for guests with board games and movie projectors for rainy days, and there\u2019s an honesty bar stocked with local wines and beers. Solar energy powers the whole place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"521acf427c91e33b0f0d0fe7acdec3081bd0aed0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521acf427c91e33b0f0d0fe7acdec3081bd0aed0/0_0_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Starlings over Elmley nature reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starlings over Elmley nature reserve</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Douglas Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After checking out the hut we\u2019re staying in, the Ferryman\u2019s (with room, too, for a couple of kids on a hammock or pull-out bed, and an outdoor shower as well as indoor bathroom), we\u2019ve time for a pre-dinner stroll through Elmley\u2019s wildlife-rich marshes and meadows. We follow a gravel track along the seawall to the first of the reserve\u2019s four hides and gaze out over one of the most important sites in the UK for breeding waders. In winter, tens of thousands of lapwings (a particular success story here), redshanks, golden plovers, teals and wigeons fill the skies, while short-eared owls are also common; birds such as oystercatchers and marsh harriers can be seen here all year round while autumn sees migrants such as green sandpiper and whimbrel stop over en route to Africa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4516a75e823ce48af1a13d255b8f6b34cff271a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4516a75e823ce48af1a13d255b8f6b34cff271a7/0_202_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shepherd\u2019s Huts, Elmley Nature Reserve, Kent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shepherd\u2019s hut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Canis/Robert Canis/Canopy and Srars</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Further on, other hides offer more unbroken views over shallow ponds, wetlands and grasslands.

      "bodyText": "Beyond the glass wall of the shepherd\u2019s hut, a vast flat landscape stretches to touch wide open skies. A yellow wagtail takes wing in a flash of colour and the long grass quivers as a hare emerges, glances our way and then scarpers. To the east lie salt marshes, mudflats and glistening waters of the Swale, a tidal channel of the Thames estuary, its far bank dotted with industrial buildings, adding an edginess to the stark natural beauty. Elmley nature reserve on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent is just over an hour from London, yet there\u2019s a sense of peaceful isolation. The 3,300-acre site is the only family-owned and managed national nature reserve in the UK \u2013 Georgina Fulton, daughter of pioneering farmers and conservationists Philip and Corinne Merricks, runs it with husband Gareth \u2013 and it\u2019s the only one you can stay overnight. By day it welcomes walkers and birdwatchers; stay on, though, and you\u2019ll have it all practically to yourself. We arrive late afternoon, via a bridge from the mainland \u2013 until the 1940s a ferry was the only way across. As islands go, Sheppey isn\u2019t a conventional beauty; a medley of marshland, industrial sprawl and holiday camps, it is the butt of many a Kent mainlander joke. But as soon as we turn into Elmley\u2019s two-mile driveway \u2013 made by Canadian soldiers garrisoned here during the second world war \u2013 I\u2019m bewitched by its empty, echoing charm and darting birdlife. There are six huts to stay in on the reserve. Made of sustainable wood or corrugated iron, with epic views and nice touches like hot-water bottles and chunky woollen throws (some have kitchenettes too), they are spread out to ensure privacy and full nature immersion. The reserve\u2019s 18th-century farmhouse is now open after renovation: marrying sweeping views of the reserve to a high-spec modern kitchen with glamorous vintage vibe, it can be rented in its entirety (sleeps 12, plus two children) or as individual rooms for B&amp;B stays during the week. There\u2019s a new cottage too, sleeping 10, with wraparound windows and a spacious living area. At the heart of the reserve is a beautiful 19th-century barn: popular for weddings, it also serves as a communal space for guests with board games and movie projectors for rainy days, and there\u2019s an honesty bar stocked with local wines and beers. Solar energy powers the whole place. After checking out the hut we\u2019re staying in, the Ferryman\u2019s (with room, too, for a couple of kids on a hammock or pull-out bed, and an outdoor shower as well as indoor bathroom), we\u2019ve time for a pre-dinner stroll through Elmley\u2019s wildlife-rich marshes and meadows. We follow a gravel track along the seawall to the first of the reserve\u2019s four hides and gaze out over one of the most important sites in the UK for breeding waders. In winter, tens of thousands of lapwings (a particular success story here), redshanks, golden plovers, teals and wigeons fill the skies, while short-eared owls are also common; birds such as oystercatchers and marsh harriers can be seen here all year round while autumn sees migrants such as green sandpiper and whimbrel stop over en route to Africa. Further on, other hides offer more unbroken views over shallow ponds, wetlands and grasslands. Spitend Hide, on the eastern tip, overlooks the Swale Estuary \u2013 and those who make the 3\u00bd-mile walk will find a hamper there filled with blankets and treats. We wander back before nightfall, clouds of dragonflies dancing in the early evening light, the sound of marsh frogs filling the air.

At their 1960s peak, with Detroit-based Motown records, the Supremes rivalled the Beatles. Wilson\u2019s 1986 autobiography, <em>Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme</em>, was a bestseller. She had three children (one of whom, Rafael, 16, died when the Jeep Cherokee his mother was driving overturned on a highway in 1994).

You can look at Beyonc\u00e9, and I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t she who copied us, but her mother would have grown up with the Supremes. We loved to dress up. Other girls, like the Shirelles, wore gowns, but our clothes were like couture.</p> <p><strong>The Supremes\u2019 style was also a political statement \u2013 about black affluence and sophistication, all the huge social and cultural changes of the period.</strong><br>Yes, my brother would say: \u201cMary, why don\u2019t y\u2019all wear some afros?\u201d I\u2019m like, no, we\u2019re making a statement in our own way.

People say: \u201cMotown, it was this big building\u201d, but I always say no, Motown was always a collaboration between the people, with Berry (Gordy) at the head of course.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve had disputes with Motown over the years, but you\u2019re like a family?</strong><br>Yes, a family. I think we all think of ourselves as distant cousins. There are some things, but there\u2019s no hate \u2013 I still would want to be at Motown. And you know, there\u2019s always going to be <em>something</em> \u2013 even if you\u2019re married to the man you love, maybe he leaves up the toilet seat?</p> <p><strong>For a time, the Supremes outsold the Beatles. Didn\u2019t they meet you and call you \u201csquare\u201d?</strong><br>We were \u2013 there were rock\u2019n\u2019roll girls and we were good girls! I don\u2019t think there was rivalry between us and the Beatles.

Unless some person irks you and you think, \u201cThat person irks me!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Wasn\u2019t Princess Margaret rather rude to you at a Royal Variety </strong><strong>Performance?</strong><br>Yes. She said: \u201cIs that a wig you\u2019re wearing?\u201d And it was loud! I thought [with] royalty, you\u2019d meet them and it would be: \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to meet you\u201d, but it was: <em>\u201cOh, is that a wig you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</em> Whoa!

      "bodyText": "Mary Wilson, 75, was a founding member of the Supremes, with Diana Ross and Florence Ballard. At their 1960s peak, with Detroit-based Motown records, the Supremes rivalled the Beatles. Wilson\u2019s 1986 autobiography, Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme, was a bestseller. She had three children (one of whom, Rafael, 16, died when the Jeep Cherokee his mother was driving overturned on a highway in 1994). Meeting to discuss her new book Supreme Glamour, a sartorial history of the Supremes, Wilson is friendly, warm and delighted to be back in Britain, where she first toured in the 1960s, later living here for a while: \u201cI fell in love with it here \u2013 I thought I was going to marry an Englishman!\u201d Featuring creations from designers from Michael Travis to You call the Supremes \u201cthe original pop fashionistas\u201d. We were! You can look at Beyonc\u00e9, and I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t she who copied us, but her mother would have grown up with the Supremes. We loved to dress up. Other girls, like the Shirelles, wore gowns, but our clothes were like couture. The Supremes\u2019 style was also a political statement \u2013 about black affluence and sophistication, all the huge social and cultural changes of the period. Yes, my brother would say: \u201cMary, why don\u2019t y\u2019all wear some afros?\u201d I\u2019m like, no, we\u2019re making a statement in our own way. That was the time of \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d and \u201cblack pride\u201d, which was cool. We did it later. You were just teenagers when you joined Motown... It really was like walking into a Disneyland. All these creative people. People say: \u201cMotown, it was this big building\u201d, but I always say no, Motown was always a collaboration between the people, with Berry (Gordy) at the head of course. You\u2019ve had disputes with Motown over the years, but you\u2019re like a family? Yes, a family. I think we all think of ourselves as distant cousins. There are some things, but there\u2019s no hate \u2013 I still would want to be at Motown. And you know, there\u2019s always going to be something \u2013 even if you\u2019re married to the man you love, maybe he leaves up the toilet seat? For a time, the Supremes outsold the Beatles. Didn\u2019t they meet you and call you \u201csquare\u201d? We were \u2013 there were rock\u2019n\u2019roll girls and we were good girls! I don\u2019t think there was rivalry between us and the Beatles. Paul [McCartney] called me when Diane [Diana Ross] left, saying: \u201cWhy did she leave \u2013 what\u2019s going on?\u201d Entertainers are really quite friendly with each other. Unless some person irks you and you think, \u201cThat person irks me!\u201d Wasn\u2019t Princess Margaret rather rude to you at a Royal Variety Performance? Yes. She said: \u201cIs that a wig you\u2019re wearing?\u201d And it was loud! I thought [with] royalty, you\u2019d meet them and it would be: \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to meet you\u201d, but it was: \u201cOh, is that a wig you\u2019re wearing?\u201d Whoa! She sounded like one of my neighbours in the projects. You write about the Supremes touring the deep south, dealing with segregated hotels and bathrooms. There were signs that said \u201cNo coloured\u201d. If you drank out of a water fountain that said it was for white people, they could hang you.

Someone asked me: How do you feel?\u201d I said: \u201cI can see my mom, my aunt, my uncles, all saying, \u2018Hallelujah! Hallelujah!\u2019\u201d Have you felt a change of atmosphere with Trump? Are you kidding? Of course! I don\u2019t mind the Republican beliefs, it\u2019s not about that. But his thinking is all wrong. Not to get too much into politics, but it should be about what the people want, about helping the people, not about personal opinions. There\u2019ve been rifts with Diana Ross.

      "body": "<p>If you had told my teen self I\u2019d be a beauty journalist and that I would write a book on beauty, particularly one geared towards women of colour, I\u2019d have called you a false prophet. \u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see\u201d is a hackneyed phrase, but in my case rang true. I loved magazines, but I always skipped the beauty pages. The voices behind them didn\u2019t speak to me. The faces on the pages didn\u2019t look like me. The products weren\u2019t geared towards me. I had no place there. Growing up, I had always heard my Nigerian parents and their friends say: \u201cThis is not our country.\u201d And so, despite being British, I parked any expectation to be included in the beauty industry. It never occurred to me that I could be a part of this world, let alone driving change from within.</p> <p>When I started writing about beauty, almost 15 years ago, it was nothing to do with race. My reasons were pragmatic. I was a freelance fashion writer, work had dried up, so I turned my hand to writing everything and anything because at that time, in the timeless words of Gwen Guthrie, Ain\u2019t Nothing Going on But the Rent. And I was irked by the way beauty was written \u2013 fluffy and asinine, as if for one-dimensional airheads. I made a conscious decision to go against that. Unconsciously, however, my foray into the beauty world was driven by my blackness and the industry\u2019s rejection of it. My route to realising that was surprising, even to me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3dcdbfd50bf522a0196768d21f1abdfc8be8b372\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dcdbfd50bf522a0196768d21f1abdfc8be8b372/0_48_2000_2811/711.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Watching this British-born black woman navigate a very white blows my mind\u2019: Pat McGrath, the world\u2019s most influential makeup artist.\" width=\"711\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Watching this British-born black woman navigate a very white blows my mind\u2019: Pat McGrath, the world\u2019s most influential makeup artist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rabbani and Solimene Photography/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In February 2017, to coincide with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\" title=\"\">Black History Month</a> in the US, CNN launched a project inspired by WEB DuBois\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/23/100-best-nonfiction-books-souls-black-folk-web-du-bois-african-american-consciousness-civil-rights\" title=\"\">The Souls of Black Folks</a></em>, a literary classic that talks about race and ethnicity in America. Du Bois wrote about the first time his skin colour made him realise he was different. CNN chronicled a number of high profile people of colour revealing their own personal \u201cmoment\u201d. It was called \u201cThe First Time I Realised I Was Black.\u201d I pondered this, wondering what my answer would be. </p> <p>I was born in St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, London, and grew up by the Albert Embankment. We weren\u2019t posh. We lived in a council house that happened to be in Zone 1. In the early 80s, when I was five, we moved to Lagos, Nigeria. I don\u2019t recall a single conversation there where anyone discussed being black. There were conversations about politics, which we studied in school. There were conversations about class, a residue of colonialism. And there were conversations about skin tone. (Centuries of being brainwashed to believe the fairer-skinned are superior and should, therefore, be more favoured \u2013 particularly if their facial features mimic Eurocentric ideals of beauty \u2013 has had a rippling effect. Ever wondered why the bestselling black female artists are Rhianna and Beyonc\u00e9?) But this was the closest we came to discussing \u201cblackness\u201d. Which was why, when I returned to London five years later, I still did not consider myself \u201cblack\u201d. But goodness, I soon found out just how \u201cother\u201d I was.</p> <p>At school, a mixed comprehensive, I was the \u201cAfrican\u201d. Children spat out the word in repulsion. Teachers would speak to me slowly as if English wasn\u2019t my first language. Someone once called me \u201cBlack Attack\u201d because of my dark skin. I had short hair (I needed a hairstyle with minimal upkeep because I\u2019d attended a boarding school in Nigeria.) My TWA (Teeny Weeny Afro) became a taking point. I remember someone sniggering that I looked like Kunta Kinte, the central character in Alex Haley\u2019s <em>Roots</em>, viciously taken from his African village and sold into slavery. At swimming classes, I was the girl who \u201cdidn\u2019t need arm bands because her rubber lips would help her float\u201d. I am strangely sadder about those words now than I was then. I now see the depth and layers of hate from which this ignorance stems. As a young girl, I couldn\u2019t articulate my feelings beyond thinking: \u201cThis white boy is really horrible to me and thinks he is really funny.\u201d Even so, these experiences made me feel \u201cdifferent\u201d, but they were not signifiers of my blackness. I discovered that in something much more pedestrian: a trip to the chemist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8178a2a16a26b4d1d793ce4950fedb60eeea3387\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8178a2a16a26b4d1d793ce4950fedb60eeea3387/686_70_2269_1361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cultural icons, speaking for change and representation in the industry: Edward Enninful, Rihanna and Naomi Campbell at the 2014 British Fashion Awards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cultural icons, speaking for change and representation in the industry: Edward Enninful, Rihanna and Naomi Campbell at the 2014 British Fashion Awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I hit adolescence, I begun to get interested in beauty, not as a potential vocation, but to attract boys and to tackle my confidence-crippling acne. I\u2019d surreptitiously take from my mother\u2019s stash of lipsticks \u2013 coloured bullets she\u2019d pick up from random stalls and stores in Brixton. The quality stretched from OK to diabolical. But I didn\u2019t care. I would swipe it across my lips and head into school convinced I epitomised sophistication.</p> <p>One day, I walked into the local pharmacy with my Caucasian friends to scope the beauty offering. While my friends giggled excitedly about their finds, everything I tried either left an ashy finish or just didn\u2019t show up \u2013 the pigments weren\u2019t strong enough. Still I persevered, because at that age, aren\u2019t we all desperate to be part of the collective? I moved towards the foundations and chose the darkest shade. It was called \u201cBiscuit\u201d. I looked like I had white chalk on my skin. I laughed to hide my embarrassment but, at that moment, everything changed. Suddenly colour mattered, in more ways than one. This is when I realised I was black. It was like I had turned up to a party to which I was not invited. I felt irrelevant, excluded and ashamed. The message from the beauty industry was loud and clear: I was not valuable enough to be part of the conversation.</p> <p><em><strong>In the years</strong></em> that followed, there were a few lights in the tunnel. I remember the first time I saw Naomi Campbell in <em>Vogue</em>. I was mesmerised. She looked like me \u2013 as far as skin colour went at least. In truth, she fitted into what the industry see as the acceptable face of black. But she was black and that was enough for me. It gave me hope.</p> <p>There were other key moments. After years of accepting and wearing foundations that were not made for my skin, I discovered MAC in the 90s. Their Studio Fix Foundation was a game changer. This mainstream brand was arguably the first to create foundations covering a wide spectrum of hues. I would go as far as saying it changed the lives of beauty-loving black women. It was the first foundation I wore that made me feel beautiful.</p> <p>The rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/15/pat-mcgrath-25-years-of-skin-secrets-from-fashions-go-to-makeup-artist\" title=\"\">Pat McGrath</a>, the world\u2019s most influential makeup artist, also had an impact on how I viewed beauty. Even now, watching this British-born black woman navigate a very white space and reach the top of the game blows my mind. Still, the culture of silence around the lack of products available to darker skin types remained. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d733dc96bc07624766f126652812469f406e30ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d733dc96bc07624766f126652812469f406e30ba/1037_43_2477_4045/612.jpg\" alt=\"Happy in my skin: Funmi Fetto wears dress by Preen by Thornton Bregazzi, mytheresa.com.\" width=\"612\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Happy in my skin: Funmi Fetto wears dress by Preen by Thornton Bregazzi, <a href=\"http://mytheresa.com\">mytheresa.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Titlow/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are those who may think: \u201cIt\u2019s just beauty, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Makeup and skincare are powerful tools that have helped me cope with difficult moments in my life.

It is an exquisite hydrator, one of the few hair products that claims to be \u201csuitable for all hair textures\u201d and actually delivers on Afro hair. It smells really coconutty, though I\u2019m not even sure it has coconut in it. But it does contain vitamin E, UV protection, and lychee extract <br> to protect hair.</p> <h2>Glow to go: skin highlighter</h2> <p><strong>Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector Liquid Highlighter, \u00a330, <a href=\"http://johnlewis.co.uk\">johnlewis.co.uk</a> </strong>A magnificent highlighter. It comes in different textures \u2013 the liquid version has been described as soft focus in a bottle. I use Topaz on a daily basis because it fools people into thinking you have the best skin in the world. It\u2019s glossy. And it has no glitter in it, which can look ridiculous.</p> <h2>Gently effective: capital cleanser</h2> <p><strong>Sunday Riley Ceramic Slip, \u00a328, <a href=\"http://spacenk.com\">spacenk.com</a> </strong>Nearly everyone who gave a five-star review of this cleanser was white, so for a long time I didn\u2019t try it. Also, if I hear something is \u201cgentle\u201d, what I really hear is: \u201cHey guys, I don\u2019t do very much.\u201d But this is phenomenal \u2013 a silky gel that gives a deep clean without drying the skin.</p> <h2>Lash out: miracle mascara</h2> <p><strong>Stila Huge Extreme Lash Mascara, \u00a319, <a href=\"http://stila.co.uk\">stila.co.uk</a> </strong>As you age, your lashes will go from being a fan of feathers to pitiful stumps of nothing. What\u2019s scary is that you\u2019ll have no idea when it\u2019ll happen. If you don\u2019t want to spend your life buried under false lashes, what\u2019s the alternative? Well, this. The clue is in the word \u2013 huge. With this mascara, you see an immediate lift with one coat. It won\u2019t clump your lashes. And, thanks to conditioners, it doesn\u2019t crisp. Always a good thing.</p> <h2>Lip service: liquid colour</h2> <p><strong>Lime Crime Liquid Lipstick, \u00a318, <a href=\"http://boots.com\">boots.com</a> </strong>Not all liquids lipsticks are made equal. Some are so thick and unyielding they drag across your lips; others are so flimsy that you would struggle to get a consistent colour pay-off, and many leave you with a cracked dryness that feels like a sprinkling of pencil shavings. Lime Crime joins a coterie of brands I feel have perfected the liquid lipstick; the texture is a velvety matte that glides on effortlessly. It feels so light and conditioning, and the pigment packs a punch.</p> <h2>The cheek of it: blushes all round</h2> <p><strong>NARS Blush, \u00a325, <a href=\"http://narscosmetics.co.uk\">narscosmetics.co.uk</a> </strong>Nars calls itself \u201cthe ultimate authority in blush\u201d, and I get it. There is no colour, finish or texture that you can\u2019t find under its wing. \u201cOrgasm\u201d is probably its most famous product, a pinky-gold shimmery powder with a silky finish. On dark skins, you\u2019d struggle to get a true representation of colour. Taj Mahal (a shimmering burnt-orange) might fare better, especially if you were going to wear foundation.</p> <h2>Brighten up: splash-out serum</h2> <p><strong>Zelens Brightening Serum, \u00a3135, <a href=\"http://net-a-porter.com\">net-a-porter.com</a> </strong>I had a conversation recently with a fellow journalist as to how much is too much for a beauty product. Some people are addicted to expensive products. I think most are placebos, that with advanced formulations it is possible to find cheaper alternatives. But there are exceptions. This is one. Yes, there\u2019s only 30ml in a bottle. But it is above and beyond the many brightening serums I\u2019ve used.</p> <h2>Red-wine glow: a<em> </em>better complexion</h2> <p><strong>Neogen Peeling Pads, \u00a327, <a href=\"http://net-a-porter.com\">net-a-porter.com</a> </strong>Exfoliating pads soaked in wine. Not the drinking kind, but the kind that revolutionises your skin. The star ingredient is resveratrol, an antioxidant derivative of red wine that sloughs off dead skin cells, protects your skin from pigmentation and premature ageing, declogs pores and gives you a brighter complexion. If you asked for more, it would be greedy. Plus, the smell! Nostalgically sweet, fruity and juicy.</p> <h2>Sun smart: best of a brand</h2> <p><strong>Glossier Invisible Shield, \u00a320, <a href=\"http://glossier.com\">glossier.com</a> </strong>I love Glossier. But do I use all the range? Embarrassingly, no. I love the idea of Glossier. I love the ethos. I love the authentic sense of community the brand has created. And I love the clever, forward-thinking way they operate. There is one product in the Glossier line-up that I use more than anything else: the sunscreen. It\u2019s superb, and, as the name states, invisible. Not only does it protect skin from the sun, the ingredient list \u2013 vitamin E, broccoli and aloe leaf \u2013 reads like an ode to antioxidants.</p> <h2>Smooth talk: excellent exfoliant</h2> <p><strong>Paula\u2019s Choice Liquid Exfoliant, \u00a328, <a href=\"http://cultbeauty.co.uk\">cultbeauty.co.uk</a> </strong>This liquid exfoliator is possibly the product I\u2019ve recommended the most. It removes dead skin, gets rid of debris in the pores and refines skin, making it smoother, more balanced and with a healthy glow.</p> <p><em>Funmi Fetto is the Observer\u2019s beauty columnist and also the executive editor and beauty director at Glamour</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "If you had told my teen self I\u2019d be a beauty journalist and that I would write a book on beauty, particularly one geared towards women of colour, I\u2019d have called you a false prophet. \u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see\u201d is a hackneyed phrase, but in my case rang true. I loved magazines, but I always skipped the beauty pages. The voices behind them didn\u2019t speak to me. The faces on the pages didn\u2019t look like me. The products weren\u2019t geared towards me. I had no place there. Growing up, I had always heard my Nigerian parents and their friends say: \u201cThis is not our country.\u201d And so, despite being British, I parked any expectation to be included in the beauty industry. It never occurred to me that I could be a part of this world, let alone driving change from within. When I started writing about beauty, almost 15 years ago, it was nothing to do with race. My reasons were pragmatic. I was a freelance fashion writer, work had dried up, so I turned my hand to writing everything and anything because at that time, in the timeless words of Gwen Guthrie, Ain\u2019t Nothing Going on But the Rent. And I was irked by the way beauty was written \u2013 fluffy and asinine, as if for one-dimensional airheads. I made a conscious decision to go against that. Unconsciously, however, my foray into the beauty world was driven by my blackness and the industry\u2019s rejection of it. My route to realising that was surprising, even to me. In February 2017, to coincide with Black History Month in the US, CNN launched a project inspired by WEB DuBois\u2019s The Souls of Black Folks, a literary classic that talks about race and ethnicity in America. Du Bois wrote about the first time his skin colour made him realise he was different. CNN chronicled a number of high profile people of colour revealing their own personal \u201cmoment\u201d. It was called \u201cThe First Time I Realised I Was Black.\u201d I pondered this, wondering what my answer would be. I was born in St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, London, and grew up by the Albert Embankment. We weren\u2019t posh. We lived in a council house that happened to be in Zone 1. In the early 80s, when I was five, we moved to Lagos, Nigeria. I don\u2019t recall a single conversation there where anyone discussed being black. There were conversations about politics, which we studied in school. There were conversations about class, a residue of colonialism. And there were conversations about skin tone. (Centuries of being brainwashed to believe the fairer-skinned are superior and should, therefore, be more favoured \u2013 particularly if their facial features mimic Eurocentric ideals of beauty \u2013 has had a rippling effect. Ever wondered why the bestselling black female artists are Rhianna and Beyonc\u00e9?) But this was the closest we came to discussing \u201cblackness\u201d. Which was why, when I returned to London five years later, I still did not consider myself \u201cblack\u201d. But goodness, I soon found out just how \u201cother\u201d I was. At school, a mixed comprehensive, I was the \u201cAfrican\u201d. Children spat out the word in repulsion. Teachers would speak to me slowly as if English wasn\u2019t my first language. Someone once called me \u201cBlack Attack\u201d because of my dark skin. I had short hair (I needed a hairstyle with minimal upkeep because I\u2019d attended a boarding school in Nigeria.) My TWA (Teeny Weeny Afro) became a taking point. I remember someone sniggering that I looked like Kunta Kinte, the central character in Alex Haley\u2019s Roots, viciously taken from his African village and sold into slavery. At swimming classes, I was the girl who \u201cdidn\u2019t need arm bands because her rubber lips would help her float\u201d. I am strangely sadder about those words now than I was then. I now see the depth and layers of hate from which this ignorance stems. As a young girl, I couldn\u2019t articulate my feelings beyond thinking: \u201cThis white boy is really horrible to me and thinks he is really funny.\u201d Even so, these experiences made me feel \u201cdifferent\u201d, but they were not signifiers of my blackness. I discovered that in something much more pedestrian: a trip to the chemist. When I hit adolescence, I begun to get interested in beauty, not as a potential vocation, but to attract boys and to tackle my confidence-crippling acne. I\u2019d surreptitiously take from my mother\u2019s stash of lipsticks \u2013 coloured bullets she\u2019d pick up from random stalls and stores in Brixton. The quality stretched from OK to diabolical. But I didn\u2019t care. I would swipe it across my lips and head into school convinced I epitomised sophistication. One day, I walked into the local pharmacy with my Caucasian friends to scope the beauty offering. While my friends giggled excitedly about their finds, everything I tried either left an ashy finish or just didn\u2019t show up \u2013 the pigments weren\u2019t strong enough. Still I persevered, because at that age, aren\u2019t we all desperate to be part of the collective? I moved towards the foundations and chose the darkest shade. It was called \u201cBiscuit\u201d. I looked like I had white chalk on my skin. I laughed to hide my embarrassment but, at that moment, everything changed. Suddenly colour mattered, in more ways than one. This is when I realised I was black. It was like I had turned up to a party to which I was not invited. I felt irrelevant, excluded and ashamed. The message from the beauty industry was loud and clear: I was not valuable enough to be part of the conversation. In the years that followed, there were a few lights in the tunnel. I remember the first time I saw Naomi Campbell in Vogue. I was mesmerised. She looked like me \u2013 as far as skin colour went at least. In truth, she fitted into what the industry see as the acceptable face of black. But she was black and that was enough for me. It gave me hope. There were other key moments. After years of accepting and wearing foundations that were not made for my skin, I discovered MAC in the 90s. Their Studio Fix Foundation was a game changer. This mainstream brand was arguably the first to create foundations covering a wide spectrum of hues. I would go as far as saying it changed the lives of beauty-loving black women. It was the first foundation I wore that made me feel beautiful. The rise of Pat McGrath, the world\u2019s most influential makeup artist, also had an impact on how I viewed beauty. Even now, watching this British-born black woman navigate a very white space and reach the top of the game blows my mind. Still, the culture of silence around the lack of products available to darker skin types remained. There are those who may think: \u201cIt\u2019s just beauty, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Makeup and skincare are powerful tools that have helped me cope with difficult moments in my life. In my youth, acne plagued my skin and carried on long after I grew out of my teens. It killed my confidence. The discovery of a decent facial (Eve Lom was my first love \u2013 one of the few brands that knew how to treat darker skin), an incredible mask from Dr Sebagh, and moisturisers from Institut Esthederm restored it. Years later, when my premature son was seriously ill in intensive care, my daily hint of blush, slick of lip colour and touch of mascara provided a sense of normality when everything around me felt scarily precarious. So, no, it isn\u2019t just beauty. It holds a power that is not always tangible but, trust me, it\u2019s there. Fast forward. It\u2019s 2019. There are moments when I sense an exciting shift taking place in the beauty industry. Along with sustainability, diversity and inclusivity seem to be at the top of every agenda. Whether this will extend beyond a trend or box-ticking exercise remains to be seen, but for now it\u2019s welcome. Foundation ranges suitable for all shades are omnipresent.

Always a good thing. Lip service: liquid colour Lime Crime Liquid Lipstick, \u00a318, boots.com Not all liquids lipsticks are made equal. Some are so thick and unyielding they drag across your lips; others are so flimsy that you would struggle to get a consistent colour pay-off, and many leave you with a cracked dryness that feels like a sprinkling of pencil shavings. Lime Crime joins a coterie of brands I feel have perfected the liquid lipstick; the texture is a velvety matte that glides on effortlessly. It feels so light and conditioning, and the pigment packs a punch. The cheek of it: blushes all round NARS Blush, \u00a325, narscosmetics.co.uk Nars calls itself \u201cthe ultimate authority in blush\u201d, and I get it. There is no colour, finish or texture that you can\u2019t find under its wing. \u201cOrgasm\u201d is probably its most famous product, a pinky-gold shimmery powder with a silky finish. On dark skins, you\u2019d struggle to get a true representation of colour. Taj Mahal (a shimmering burnt-orange) might fare better, especially if you were going to wear foundation. Brighten up: splash-out serum Zelens Brightening Serum, \u00a3135, net-a-porter.com I had a conversation recently with a fellow journalist as to how much is too much for a beauty product. Some people are addicted to expensive products. I think most are placebos, that with advanced formulations it is possible to find cheaper alternatives. But there are exceptions. This is one. Yes, there\u2019s only 30ml in a bottle. But it is above and beyond the many brightening serums I\u2019ve used. Red-wine glow: a better complexion Neogen Peeling Pads, \u00a327, net-a-porter.com Exfoliating pads soaked in wine. Not the drinking kind, but the kind that revolutionises your skin. The star ingredient is resveratrol, an antioxidant derivative of red wine that sloughs off dead skin cells, protects your skin from pigmentation and premature ageing, declogs pores and gives you a brighter complexion. If you asked for more, it would be greedy. Plus, the smell! Nostalgically sweet, fruity and juicy. Sun smart: best of a brand Glossier Invisible Shield, \u00a320, glossier.com I love Glossier. But do I use all the range? Embarrassingly, no. I love the idea of Glossier. I love the ethos. I love the authentic sense of community the brand has created. And I love the clever, forward-thinking way they operate. There is one product in the Glossier line-up that I use more than anything else: the sunscreen. It\u2019s superb, and, as the name states, invisible. Not only does it protect skin from the sun, the ingredient list \u2013 vitamin E, broccoli and aloe leaf \u2013 reads like an ode to antioxidants. Smooth talk: excellent exfoliant Paula\u2019s Choice Liquid Exfoliant, \u00a328, cultbeauty.co.uk This liquid exfoliator is possibly the product I\u2019ve recommended the most. It removes dead skin, gets rid of debris in the pores and refines skin, making it smoother, more balanced and with a healthy glow.

      "bodyText": "\u2018This is my last tour before politics,\u201d says Eddie Izzard, who plans to stand as an MP at the next election. Will comedy miss him? There are moments of vintage Izzard in Wunderbar, as tigers pause to pray before hunting their dinner, and William the Conqueror learns krav maga. But they get lost amid a superfluity of waffle. And there\u2019s a weird dissonance between all this featherlight surrealism and Izzard\u2019s save-the-world ambitions, which at his misjudged encore feel practically messianic. It\u2019s not his fault that the crowd applauds his platitudes about love versus hate and improving the global population\u2019s life chances. But his rallying cries at the curtain call want for self-irony, while his theory of the universe that precedes it is less profound than he seems to think. All of which might be easier to forgive in an otherwise tight comedy show. But Wunderbar isn\u2019t that. It finds Izzard tracing the planet\u2019s history (and scorning religion) \u201cfrom the big bang to last Tuesday\u201d, via dinosaurs on quiz shows, the first ever human conversation, and, er, a rumination on the superheroes we would get if other species were, like Bruce Wayne, crossed with a bat.

When Donald Trump used the phrase against four Democratic congresswomen in July, few could doubt his implication that they did not belong in America.</p> <p>So when the BBC presenter Naga Munchetty discussed the issue with co-host Dan Walker on breakfast TV, her condemnation of the tweets as racist, and her anger at the racism she has faced, seemed both honest and stating the obvious.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/25/bbcs-naga-munchetty-reprimanded-over-trump-criticism\" title=\"\">Not to the BBC</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Go back to where you come from.\u201d It\u2019s a standard racist taunt, one that I\u2019ve heard since my first day in Britain. When Donald Trump used the phrase against four Democratic congresswomen in July, few could doubt his implication that they did not belong in America. So when the BBC presenter Naga Munchetty discussed the issue with co-host Dan Walker on breakfast TV, her condemnation of the tweets as racist, and her anger at the racism she has faced, seemed both honest and stating the obvious. Not to the BBC. Last week, its complaints unit generated a storm by ruling that while it was \u201clegitimate\u201d for Munchetty to have \u201creflected her own experience of racism\u201d, it was wrong \u201cto comment critically\u201d on the president\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d or the \u201cconsequences\u201d of his words.

That tradition inspires Gander and Chambers, if only for the obvious reason that, in 2019, it seems more admirable and creative to make something that helps people than to be \u201csome arrogant, narcissistic artist character that gets pissed on telly, shouts and makes stuff that looks kind of frivolous and wasteful, do you know what I mean?\u201d</p> <p>I do, but I still think punters buying the hooks might like to know whether or not they can say they\u2019ve got an artwork on the wall. \u201cWell, I consider art to be about belief and associated value.

So design first and foremost. But we fully understand that they can also be appreciated and relieved of their function, purely for their formal and visceral qualities.\u201d</p> <p>Those qualities will not include a uniform style. Chambers and Gander both groan at the way a lot of modern designers beaver away at a signature look, with similar pieces of work released at regular intervals. \u201cA designer shouldn\u2019t have a style,\u201d Chambers says. \u201cYou should be solving a problem that requires a certain material or a certain approach.\u201d He thinks it happens because people want to consciously buy into a defined lifestyle; Gander, on the other hand, blames the internet. \u201cSocial media has changed art colossally, and not in a good way. It\u2019s made things more retinal and less cognitive. I think in the next few years, the art world as we know it might split into two worlds. One will be cognitive, and the other will have art that functions well in places like Instagram, such as <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/features/KAWS-artist-guide-9756-1.aspx\" title=\"\">K</a><a href=\"https://www.christies.com/features/KAWS-artist-guide-9756-1.aspx\" title=\"\">aws</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/banksy\" title=\"\">Banksy</a>. You know, people like to see things they recognise, so you have a high ratio of artists who repeat themselves. I don\u2019t think that is creative endeavour, though \u2013 I\u2019m more interested in trying stuff out and making all these mistakes.

He has a stainless steel prototype (the retail version is <a href=\"https://www.silestone.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Silestone</a>) sitting on a wooden frame beside the cooker hob, with paulownia chopping boards at the cooker end and at the other a colander, draining rack and thin <a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/articles/52087/gastronorms\" title=\"\">gastronorm</a> container for compostable waste. An upper lip holds the boards in place, while a lower lip can hold various containers. The sink also has a really good plug: just a rubber ball on a chain that rolls down the sloping sink-bottom to settle in the plughole on its own. </p> <p>Gander moved to Suffolk from London 10 years ago, when his wife Rebecca was pregnant with their first child, Olive. They bought \u201cfor a pittance\u201d a dilapidated Victorian building that had been a B&amp;B and set about remodelling it; a decade later it is almost complete, all airy, cool and restrained, with a few hidden artworks built in ($25 and \u20ac30 coins from the future glued to the floor, a bubble-less spirit level embedded in the stairs). The showpiece is the living room fireplace, a replica of one designed in 1955 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/10/bauhaus-josef-anni-albers-art\" title=\"\">Josef and Anni Albers</a>, the German artist couple who taught at the Bauhaus before emigrating to the US in the 30s.</p> <p><a href=\"https://albersfoundation.org/art/josef-albers/architecture/#slide8\" title=\"\">The Albers fireplace</a> is something of a cult object. Believing that brickwork could be used as a sculptural element in homes, Josef used off-white firebricks set at different angles to create a geometric relief. He made only two, for private clients in the US, but Ryan asked the Albers Foundation for permission to make a copy, and their granddaughter Lucy agreed, on condition that they could send historians to look at it from time to time. It is the only one in Europe, and has on one side a brass plaque crediting the Albers. A local bricklayer made it: \u201cHe really enjoyed doing it,\u201d Gander says.</p> <p>The studio, a former radio factory on a lane behind a tractor dealership, was bought around the same time as the house and is where Gander makes most of his art \u2013 or rather has ideas and gets other people to make them. Using a wheelchair means there are some physical tasks he can\u2019t do, but in any case, he says, he isn\u2019t all that good at actually making things \u2013 his skill lies in making things happen. The sink was made with the help of <a href=\"https://www.mathesonwhiteley.com/about\" title=\"\">Matheson Whiteley</a>, a London architectural studio, and <a href=\"https://www.cosentino.com/en-gb/cosentino/\" title=\"\">Cosentino</a>, a Spanish materials supplier.</p> <p>For the last few years Gander has been trying to get an art school going for kids who are being pushed out of the system. When he was young, he became interested in art after being taken to <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-liverpool\" title=\"\">Tate Liverpool</a> on school trips, and went off to university in Manchester. \u201cRich kids weren\u2019t interested in making art then. Now that\u2019s changed, and kids from poorer backgrounds find it harder to go. When I visit art schools, I always sense that the kids from more difficult circumstances want something more \u2013 there\u2019s more drive, because there\u2019s nothing to fall back on, it has to work. They\u2019re bolder and they take more risks. Which is good, because risk-taking works really well in the art world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7cd55b92703a41beedee4100b6a1222772a248f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7cd55b92703a41beedee4100b6a1222772a248f/0_190_4681_3007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From Five Minds of Great Vision, 2018, an artwork in the studio garden that, when rearranged, makes a model of a cathedral.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From Five Minds of Great Vision, 2018, an artwork in the studio garden that, when rearranged, makes a model of a cathedral.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Bridges/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gander has had plans drawn up for a shipping container structure that could house the school, but thinks that in a way it already exists, \u201cas a state of permanent optimism, ambition and enthusiasm\u201d. That state is evoked on his website for <a href=\"http://fairfieldinternational.co.uk/#\" title=\"\">Fairfield International</a>, as he plans to call it, which consists mostly of a loop of inspirational slogans, such as: \u201cBecause art education as it stands kills your buzz,\u201d \u201cBecause you don\u2019t have a trust fund or a wealthy spouse\u201d and, \u201cBecause you want to make art more than you want to be an artist.\u201d Fairfield International could be anywhere, but it does feel very Suffolk. In some towns here, if you randomly chucked a pencil it would hit an art person \u2013 probably one who has moved out of London. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/24/inside-dr-frankensteins-studio-glenn-brown-macabre-mashups-come-to-dust-gagosian-london\" title=\"\">Glenn Brown</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/24/maggi-hambling-relieved-for-grandchildren-they-are-non-existent\" title=\"\">Maggi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/24/maggi-hambling-relieved-for-grandchildren-they-are-non-existent\" title=\"\"> Hambling</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/06/sarah-lucas-venice-biennale-interview\" title=\"\">Sarah Lucas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sadiecoles.com/\" title=\"\">Sadie Coles</a>, <a href=\"https://modernart.net/\" title=\"\">Stuart Shave</a> and <a href=\"http://www.artuner.com/expert/norman-rosenthal/\" title=\"\">Norman Rosenthal</a>, among others, all live here; then there are all the publishers and nature writers trundling off to contemplate the Fens.</p> <p>It was through this creative community, at a children\u2019s birthday party in Saxmundham, that Gander and Chambers ended up talking about Otomoto \u2013 Chambers lives in the Barbican in London, but has a holiday home in one of the much-coveted <a href=\"https://www.themodernhouse.com/directory-of-architects-and-designers/john-penn/\" title=\"\">California-style bungalows</a> designed by great British modernist architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/28/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">John Penn</a> and built in Suffolk in the 60s. Gander thought Chambers, knowing about the design world, might be able to help him sell the sink. Chambers was sceptical because at Wallpaper*, he had people pitching him ideas about conceptual furniture all the time. His first thought was that \u201cthere were enough kitchen sinks in the world, to be honest\u201d, then he couldn\u2019t believe that no one in Europe had thought of the close-at-hand idea before, and finally he found himself taken with \u201cthe philosophy and approach\u201d. </p> <p>Back at the studio, Gander and Chambers catch up on work, the latter revealing some of the typefaces he\u2019s had made for Otomoto. Both men love them because the faces make the letters perfectly symmetrical (like the launch date), which means, to their font-nerdish delight, that not only is Otomoto a palindrome, but it can also be read in a mirror.</p> <p>While this is happening, Gander\u2019s mother appears. She and his father moved to Suffolk from Chester a year ago and like to help him out; today she is dropping off a denim jacket on to which she has been sewing patches of corporate logos, a prototype for one of his projects. As he examines the patches, he and Chambers discuss whether or not youth style tribes have been supplanted by identity politics (Gander dislikes the latter, and never ticks the disabled box on forms because he doesn\u2019t identify as \u201csomeone in a wheelchair\u201d). As they adjust their clothes for the photograph, they talk about the effect they would like Otomoto to have. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about commercial success,\u201d Gander says, \u201cIt\u2019s also about \u2013 I know it sounds cheesy, but inspiring people. When I was a kid, I just buzzed off people who made loads of work that was all really different. I was, like, \u2018I want to do what they do! I want to get up and do something completely different every day, and try something out!\u2019 Because that\u2019s what\u2019s great about the world, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s so much you can do.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 September to clarify that Papanek was born in Austria, not Brazil.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI don\u2019t want to over-conceptualise this,\u201d says Ryan Gander, enthusiastically showing me the kitchen sink he has designed, \u201cbut the way you deal with this sink cognitively and emotionally is different from the way you deal with a normal kitchen sink. To get 100% out of it, you have to change your perspective on working in the kitchen.\u201d This is not the sort of sales patter you get at Magnet, but then conceptual artist Gander is known for his ability to theorise everything from household goods to classical sculpture, so big ideas about kitchen sinks were to be expected. To be fair, he has a point. As he moves around his creation, sitting in the middle of his studio in the village of Melton in Suffolk, he explains its system of changeable shelves, chopping boards and containers, and you can see how, yes, it would change the way you work in the kitchen. Arrange it right and you can do all your food preparation and washing in one place. If Gander contributes nothing else, he may liberate us from searching for the chopping knife. The sink is the first product released by Otomoto, the \u201clifestyle venture\u201d Gander recently founded with Tony Chambers, former editor-in-chief of Wallpaper*. \u201cOtomoto\u201d is a Japanese word meaning, loosely, \u201cclose at hand\u201d and the idea is that all the company\u2019s wares (\u201ceverything and the kitchen sink\u201d, they quip) should be convenient, ergonomic and make ordinary things pleasurable. \u201cIt\u2019s about elevating the mundane,\u201d says Chambers, who has also come down to the studio. \u201cAnd taking pride in the most everyday details.\u201d \u201cOtomoto things should enrich your life,\u201d Gander says. \u201cWe\u2019re really into the idea that if you do something boring like washing up, it shouldn\u2019t be boring. It should be joyous.\u201d In the 20 years since Gander graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University with a degree in interactive art, he has produced work ranging from painting, sculpture and architecture to lectures, customised trainers, typefaces, children\u2019s books and new words. He\u2019s interested in the way objects act as vessels for people\u2019s stories, but he\u2019s just as happy talking about commonplace creativity as art. Art for him is about experimenting with ideas and \u201ctrying to make some original contribution to human history and human knowledge, like an explorer\u201d, but he thinks the way people are usually creative \u201cis things like bumper stickers, the clothes we wear, what we serve when friends come round for dinner, or what we post on social media\u201d. Some of his best work, such as his plaster sculptures of his nine-year-old daughter\u2019s dens, takes that sort of creativity and recasts it as something that can be shown in galleries. In a way, Otomoto reverses that process, taking the kind of conceptual thinking you might associate with artists and applying it to everyday stuff. Meanwhile Chambers, a well-connected player in the design world who transformed Wallpaper* from a magazine to a multi-format media brand, has a creative input into the goods, but also knows how to present them as products. The next release, when the company officially launches in February next year (on the second, because the date, 02.02.2020, is symmetrical), is unconfirmed, but likely to be either a poker or a collection of wall hooks. Gander leads us to an office where he retrieves the poker prototype from one of his staff.

But we fully understand that they can also be appreciated and relieved of their function, purely for their formal and visceral qualities.\u201d Those qualities will not include a uniform style. Chambers and Gander both groan at the way a lot of modern designers beaver away at a signature look, with similar pieces of work released at regular intervals. \u201cA designer shouldn\u2019t have a style,\u201d Chambers says. \u201cYou should be solving a problem that requires a certain material or a certain approach.\u201d He thinks it happens because people want to consciously buy into a defined lifestyle; Gander, on the other hand, blames the internet. \u201cSocial media has changed art colossally, and not in a good way. It\u2019s made things more retinal and less cognitive. I think in the next few years, the art world as we know it might split into two worlds. One will be cognitive, and the other will have art that functions well in places like Instagram, such as Kaws or Banksy. You know, people like to see things they recognise, so you have a high ratio of artists who repeat themselves. I don\u2019t think that is creative endeavour, though \u2013 I\u2019m more interested in trying stuff out and making all these mistakes. That\u2019s how you get to things that are really good.\u201d Ten miles from the studio, at Gander\u2019s home in Saxmundham, we see his sink in action. He has a stainless steel prototype (the retail version is Silestone) sitting on a wooden frame beside the cooker hob, with paulownia chopping boards at the cooker end and at the other a colander, draining rack and thin gastronorm container for compostable waste. An upper lip holds the boards in place, while a lower lip can hold various containers. The sink also has a really good plug: just a rubber ball on a chain that rolls down the sloping sink-bottom to settle in the plughole on its own. Gander moved to Suffolk from London 10 years ago, when his wife Rebecca was pregnant with their first child, Olive. They bought \u201cfor a pittance\u201d a dilapidated Victorian building that had been a B&amp;B and set about remodelling it; a decade later it is almost complete, all airy, cool and restrained, with a few hidden artworks built in ($25 and \u20ac30 coins from the future glued to the floor, a bubble-less spirit level embedded in the stairs). The showpiece is the living room fireplace, a replica of one designed in 1955 by Josef and Anni Albers, the German artist couple who taught at the Bauhaus before emigrating to the US in the 30s. The Albers fireplace is something of a cult object. Believing that brickwork could be used as a sculptural element in homes, Josef used off-white firebricks set at different angles to create a geometric relief. He made only two, for private clients in the US, but Ryan asked the Albers Foundation for permission to make a copy, and their granddaughter Lucy agreed, on condition that they could send historians to look at it from time to time. It is the only one in Europe, and has on one side a brass plaque crediting the Albers. A local bricklayer made it: \u201cHe really enjoyed doing it,\u201d Gander says. The studio, a former radio factory on a lane behind a tractor dealership, was bought around the same time as the house and is where Gander makes most of his art \u2013 or rather has ideas and gets other people to make them. Using a wheelchair means there are some physical tasks he can\u2019t do, but in any case, he says, he isn\u2019t all that good at actually making things \u2013 his skill lies in making things happen. The sink was made with the help of Matheson Whiteley, a London architectural studio, and Cosentino, a Spanish materials supplier. For the last few years Gander has been trying to get an art school going for kids who are being pushed out of the system. When he was young, he became interested in art after being taken to Tate Liverpool on school trips, and went off to university in Manchester. \u201cRich kids weren\u2019t interested in making art then. Now that\u2019s changed, and kids from poorer backgrounds find it harder to go. When I visit art schools, I always sense that the kids from more difficult circumstances want something more \u2013 there\u2019s more drive, because there\u2019s nothing to fall back on, it has to work. They\u2019re bolder and they take more risks. Which is good, because risk-taking works really well in the art world.\u201d Gander has had plans drawn up for a shipping container structure that could house the school, but thinks that in a way it already exists, \u201cas a state of permanent optimism, ambition and enthusiasm\u201d. That state is evoked on his website for Fairfield International, as he plans to call it, which consists mostly of a loop of inspirational slogans, such as: \u201cBecause art education as it stands kills your buzz,\u201d \u201cBecause you don\u2019t have a trust fund or a wealthy spouse\u201d and, \u201cBecause you want to make art more than you want to be an artist.\u201d Fairfield International could be anywhere, but it does feel very Suffolk. In some towns here, if you randomly chucked a pencil it would hit an art person \u2013 probably one who has moved out of London. Glenn Brown, Maggi Hambling, Sarah Lucas, Sadie Coles, Stuart Shave and Norman Rosenthal, among others, all live here; then there are all the publishers and nature writers trundling off to contemplate the Fens. It was through this creative community, at a children\u2019s birthday party in Saxmundham, that Gander and Chambers ended up talking about Otomoto \u2013 Chambers lives in the Barbican in London, but has a holiday home in one of the much-coveted California-style bungalows designed by great British modernist architect John Penn and built in Suffolk in the 60s. Gander thought Chambers, knowing about the design world, might be able to help him sell the sink. Chambers was sceptical because at Wallpaper*, he had people pitching him ideas about conceptual furniture all the time. His first thought was that \u201cthere were enough kitchen sinks in the world, to be honest\u201d, then he couldn\u2019t believe that no one in Europe had thought of the close-at-hand idea before, and finally he found himself taken with \u201cthe philosophy and approach\u201d. Back at the studio, Gander and Chambers catch up on work, the latter revealing some of the typefaces he\u2019s had made for Otomoto. Both men love them because the faces make the letters perfectly symmetrical (like the launch date), which means, to their font-nerdish delight, that not only is Otomoto a palindrome, but it can also be read in a mirror. While this is happening, Gander\u2019s mother appears. She and his father moved to Suffolk from Chester a year ago and like to help him out; today she is dropping off a denim jacket on to which she has been sewing patches of corporate logos, a prototype for one of his projects. As he examines the patches, he and Chambers discuss whether or not youth style tribes have been supplanted by identity politics (Gander dislikes the latter, and never ticks the disabled box on forms because he doesn\u2019t identify as \u201csomeone in a wheelchair\u201d). As they adjust their clothes for the photograph, they talk about the effect they would like Otomoto to have. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about commercial success,\u201d Gander says, \u201cIt\u2019s also about \u2013 I know it sounds cheesy, but inspiring people. When I was a kid, I just buzzed off people who made loads of work that was all really different. I was, like, \u2018I want to do what they do! I want to get up and do something completely different every day, and try something out!\u2019 Because that\u2019s what\u2019s great about the world, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s so much you can do.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 30 September to clarify that Papanek was born in Austria, not Brazil.",

      "body": "<p>No one could accuse Ren\u00e9e Zellweger of not giving everything she\u2019s got. Watching her portray Judy Garland in her new film, <em>Judy</em>, it\u2019s as though she dissolves, molecule by molecule, into the role. Directed by the renowned British stage director Rupert Goold and adapted from the Olivier and Tony-nominated play by Peter Quilter, <em>Judy</em> is set in 1969, when Garland, 46, broke, fraught, separated from her children, did a run of shows at the Talk of the Town nightclub in London. Garland is depicted drinking, pill-popping, impetuously getting married, hanging out with gay fans, sometimes wowing audiences, other times getting booed. There\u2019s Zellweger\u2019s physical transformation with contact lenses and prosthetics, but it\u2019s also in her insolent swagger over to the microphone when Garland is too drunk to perform. The slightly wild stare that begs you to look at her, but also implores you to look away. Zellweger even sings in character \u2013 live! A climactic hoarse rendition of Over the Rainbow is particularly poignant. With every gulp, twitch and shiver, Zellweger, starring alongside Michael Gambon, Jessie Buckley, and Rufus Sewell, makes it her business to <em>be</em> Judy Garland, and at times it\u2019s almost painful to watch.</p> <p>It\u2019s a turn that has generated much awards buzz. <em>Variety</em> magazine said: \u201cZellweger offers an all-singing, all-dancing, all-collapsing performance of a star at her lowest physical and psychological ebb.\u201d At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/14/toronto-film-festival-rolls-out-red-carpet\" title=\"\">recent Toronto international film festival</a>, there was such an extended and rapturous standing ovation \u2013 one journalist later tweeting that she\u2019d seen nothing like it in 15 years of attending the festival \u2013 that Zellweger eventually had to tell the audience to \u201cquit it\u201d, because her tears were \u201cmessing up\u201d her makeup. While we Brits are hyper-aware of Zellweger from the Bridget Jones films, of course her resum\u00e9 is far more varied than that, from her Girl Friday murmuring \u201cYou had me at hello\u201d in <em>Jerry Maguire </em>(1996), to Roxie in <em>Chicago</em> (2002), where she proved she could sing and dance, to her spirited farm hand in <em>Cold Mountain</em> (2003), for which she won an Oscar, and, more recently, in <em>What/If</em> on Netflix \u2013 where she camped it up as predatory Anne Montgomery (think Barbara Stanwyck via Cruella de Vil). Now, with <em>Judy</em>, Zellweger offers a study in wrecked humanity \u2013 it wasn\u2019t long after this film was set that Garland was found dead in her rented mews house in Belgravia following an accidental overdose of barbiturates.</p> <p>I\u2019m waiting in the London hotel suite where we\u2019re scheduled to meet when Zellweger pops her head around a corner to chirp \u201cHello!\u201d She\u2019s wearing a fawn-coloured outfit and pointy red shoes (her own ruby slippers?), with her hair partly pulled back. When I tell her that she looks chic, she says: \u201cOh thanks very much. It\u2019s only by mistake that I look like this today.\u201d There are some \u201cHollywood trappings\u201d (a PA type hovers in the background), but there\u2019s no starriness about Zellweger \u2013 she just plonks down on the sofa, tucking her feet beneath herself. If she is guarded about some questions, it\u2019s understandable. There are some tough subjects: the claim that Harvey Weinstein used her name to sexually pressure other actresses; the world erupting over her \u201cchanged\u201d appearance at the <em>Elle</em> Woman in Hollywood awards in 2014. Otherwise, Zellweger is softly spoken, smart, reflective, and brimming with the down-to-earth Texas charm of her upbringing. When I observe that playing Garland is one thing, but singing as her must be a whole new level of horror (perhaps I could have phrased this more delicately), she starts giggling at the word \u201chorror\u201d. \u201cThat was really well put\u2026 No, no, don\u2019t take it back \u2013 you\u2019re 100% right!\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZypuwVApJ0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DZypuwVApJ0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZypuwVApJ0\">Watch a trailer for Judy.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Asked about the differences between playing Roxie and Garland, Zellweger ticks off a list. \u201cLive performance. Live audience. Real person. Person that I care about. Person who\u2019s meant a lot to me and millions, through generations.\u201d <em>Judy</em> is also about the cruelty of the old Hollywood studio system \u2013 with scenes showing the young Judy (Darci Shaw) being controlled, nagged about her weight, and started on a regime of uppers and downers that would ruin her for life. Zellweger says that thankfully there are stricter child labour laws these days. As to whether modern female performers are better off generally, she\u2019s uncertain: \u201cBecause you see the Amy Winehouse documentary\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Garland\u2019s daughter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/liza-minnelli\" title=\"\">Liza Minnelli</a>, criticised <em>Judy</em> \u2013 posting on her Facebook page that she wasn\u2019t sanctioning the film, and had never met nor spoken to Zellweger, writing: \u201cAny reports to the contrary are 100% fiction.\u201d Does Zellweger think that was because Minnelli hadn\u2019t seen <em>Judy</em>, and would find any film about her mother difficult? There\u2019s a pause while Zellweger considers the question. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says eventually. \u201cI wish she was here so we could chat!\u201d Speaking to her, it\u2019s clear that Zellweger took pains to avoid producing an \u201cimpersonation\u201d or a caricature of Garland. \u201cShe\u2019s such a legend. But there\u2019s so much to the human being as well. You want her to come across as big as she was, but also show the woman\u2026 Her intelligence, determination, tenacity, hope. She never gave that up, no matter the circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Zellweger, 50, grew up in Katy, Texas, and studied at the University of Texas in Austin. \u201cI consider Austin home, and I have a lot of extended family there, so I get back a lot,\u201d she says. From early childhood, she wanted to be a writer. \u201cWhen the Easter bunny was coming, I would always wish for the same thing \u2013 I loved a tablet of fresh ruled paper and sharp pencils. There\u2019s nothing better \u2013 stories, poetry, the possibilities were endless.\u201d Her mother was Norwegian, and her father Swiss, which made her feel different. \u201cI very much feel my Texan roots, but there\u2019s no denying that I\u2019m a child of European people.\u201d While at university, she \u201cfell\u201d into acting roles. \u201cRather than continue on to get my journalism degree, I finished up quickly with my lit degree, just to see where [acting] would go,\u201d she says. \u201cI figured I could always go back and get a master\u2019s, and finally submit to the <em>Daily Texan</em>!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d3b9a778b4193259a93a5f7f68db1a0859ca0c2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3b9a778b4193259a93a5f7f68db1a0859ca0c2c/0_0_3504_2338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland in Judy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland in Judy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hindley/Allstar/BBC Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There seems a certain piquancy to Zellweger aiming to become a journalist when she must have often felt like media prey. Then again, Zellweger tells me that she usually has no problems wandering around incognito. She famously stepped back from screen-acting for six years in 2010, and thinks that helps her in the street. \u201cTaking that time away, when you\u2019re not in people\u2019s consciousness, they think: \u2018Oh yeah, she looks like somebody, maybe, but, um, who? I don\u2019t know\u2026\u2019\u201d Zellweger gives her distinctive throaty chuckle: \u201cI sneak around really, really well.\u201d She\u2019s also good at being private, despite high profile relationships, including Jim Carrey, Jack White, a short marriage to Kenny Chesney, Bradley Cooper and, latterly, musician Doyle Bramhall II (just before I meet her, there are rumours that they\u2019d split). Is she in a relationship? Zellweger laughs airily: \u201cI\u2019m in a million relationships!\u201d She says she doesn\u2019t find it difficult to have a personal life: \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult at all. You just don\u2019t talk about it, you don\u2019t post it\u2026 I know it\u2019s so boring when you\u2019re trying to talk to an actress and she\u2019s being all cryptic and whatever. But I like to keep it\u2026\u201d \u2013 she mimes a zipping action \u2013 \u201cI just do.\u201d It\u2019s also about work: \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to be an actor who disappears when you have no mystery.\u201d It\u2019s a distraction when there\u2019s too much of a public persona? \u201cYeah, I think a little mystery never hurt a girl.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d been wondering whether it\u2019s partly about how roles such as Bridget Jones utilise Zellweger\u2019s everywoman quality (warmth, approachability) \u2013 when people feel they know someone, maybe there\u2019s also an element of feeling they own them? Whatever\u2019s going on, Zellweger says it doesn\u2019t \u201cexist\u201d for her, because she doesn\u2019t read, watch, or in any way seek out what people are saying about her. She just ignores it? \u201cYeah, because there\u2019s no upside to not ignoring it. I wouldn\u2019t learn anything from it. It wouldn\u2019t be helpful. What would I do? Explain myself? Or try to somehow mitigate a rumour that someone has started? It seems like a lot of wasted energy to me. I could just be with my dogs, or FaceTime my nephew, or work on writing something. That\u2019s a lot of energy that you would just sort of haemorrhage. All day. On things that you can\u2019t control anyway. And why would you want to?\u201d</p> <p>One thing Zellweger did respond to was the <em>Elle</em> Woman in Hollywood awards furore, which could only be described as a global pile-on \u2013 for a while, it seemed like the entire world was accusing her of having plastic surgery. As it happens, the day I meet her, Zellweger looks exactly like herself, but that\u2019s not the point \u2013 even if those 2014 photos did look unlike her, it doesn\u2019t justify what she endured. Zellweger ended up penning an article for the Huffington Post, titled \u201cWe can do better\u201d. She wrote: \u201cNot that it\u2019s anyone\u2019s business, but I did not make a decision to alter my face and have surgery on my eyes\u201d \u2013 but the article was about much more than that, debating everything from intrusion to women\u2019s worth. To make sure I\u2019m not putting words into her mouth, I double-check with Zellweger that she wrote it (she did). It\u2019s not only an impressive, erudite read (the inner writer is on full beam), it\u2019s also brave. \u201cIt just felt necessary,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2013 was it really <em>brave</em> \u2013 if there\u2019s no consequence?\u201d She didn\u2019t know that when she wrote it. \u201cYeah, I did, I did,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing that\u2019s going to happen? What else could be said? How else could I have been made fun of? Or whatever happened\u2026 I know what that felt like, and I survived it, so what else?\u201d</p> <p>Zellweger was also dragged into #MeToo. As part of the ongoing class-action lawsuit, actor Melissa Sagemiller claimed that Harvey Weinstein told her that Zellweger and Charlize Theron had given \u201csexual favours\u201d for roles. There was a robust response from the Zellweger camp: \u201cIf Harvey said that, he\u2019s full of shit.\u201d (Though Zellweger says she didn\u2019t personally put out a statement about it.) Regarding what Weinstein is alleged to have said about her, Zellweger says: \u201cI did hear about that, yes.\u201d Generally speaking, did Zellweger have any bad experiences in the industry? \u201cNever directly in that way. But, you know, there were certain behaviours that I would tolerate because I had a job to do, and I was more interested in getting through the day than in correcting someone, certainly. They weren\u2019t offences of the variety that you\u2019re referencing. But there were certain languages and liberties that certain people would take. But they would take them from anyone, in my estimation, not just me as a woman. But I\u2019m sure there were countless instances that I was not aware of \u2013 in terms of deals that were made and conversations that were had, that were derogatory, that I was not privy to. Sure. Of course. I\u2019d be naive to think that I was immune.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"908dd8dd53a72c958468ee64eacc97b633f00a54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/908dd8dd53a72c958468ee64eacc97b633f00a54/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zellweger with Colin Firth and Patrick Dempsey in Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zellweger with Colin Firth and Patrick Dempsey in Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Keyte/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zellweger identifies as a feminist, and admires the women who came forward: \u201cIt gives you strength in numbers, doesn\u2019t it? It enables you to, in some way, begin to heal.\u201d She seems cautiously optimistic about changes in Hollywood: \u201cI think it\u2019s also right at this very delicate moment where there\u2019s fear and so everybody is hyper-aware of the decisions that they make and what they say\u2026 It will be really interesting to see where it settles. But change is inevitable because there\u2019s this new generation of women who are coming of age, and producing things, in every industry, not just Hollywood. They\u2019re not waiting for permission because they don\u2019t need to \u2013 and it never occurred to them that they needed to.\u201d</p> <p>Considering the relentless nature of Hollywood, Zellweger\u2019s six-year career break was a gamble. Was it a work-sabbatical, a fame-sabbatical, or a combination of both? \u201cI needed to take care of myself,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was more about being bored with myself, bored with my performances, and drawing on the same experiences, it just felt like regurgitated life, and I needed to collect some life experiences because the well was a bit dry. And I hadn\u2019t grown in any way for <em>years</em>\u2026 It\u2019s just redundancy. Because while the experiences were once-in-a-lifetime, dream-come-true blessings, there\u2019s not really room for anything else. And I needed to learn something else. I needed to grow as a person. To grow up a little bit. And I needed to physically take care of myself\u2026 But I didn\u2019t stop working, I still worked, just in a different capacity. I can\u2019t be idle.\u201d She has a work ethic? \u201cOh yes!\u201d</p> <p>The interview is winding to a close. Does Zellweger have any reaction to the US political climate? \u201cEvery day!\u201d Around the time we meet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/14/trump-squad-tlaib-omar-pressley-ocasio-cortez\" title=\"\">President Trump has told four congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d</a> to the countries they originally came from (three of the four women were in fact born in America). Does this kind of thing concern her? \u201cEvery day,\u201d repeats Zellweger. \u201cOf course\u2026 It\u2019s very upsetting. And it\u2019s upsetting that it\u2019s not as upsetting to as many folks as it should be.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d35e2b39e767e402d07b24fa1aa39b9a1778e14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d35e2b39e767e402d07b24fa1aa39b9a1778e14/0_117_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zellweger as Judy Garland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zellweger as Judy Garland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hindley/Allstar/BBC Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zellweger isn\u2019t able to confirm her forthcoming projects, not even if there\u2019s definitely going to be another Bridget Jones film: \u201cI\u2019m not being coy, I promise. I\u2019m always the last to know\u2026 I do know that Helen [Fielding] has written a book, so maybe.\u201d</p> <p>Zellweger once spoke about suffering from impostor syndrome \u2013 could that just be a human thing? \u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a human thing. For most people\u2026 There are brain surgeons and whatnot who have to have a different kind of certitude about their skill.\u201d Might it affect women more? \u201cThat we don\u2019t feel entitled to whatever it is that we\u2019ve worked for? That\u2019s possibly true.\u201d Stage fright ate Garland alive, and Zellweger tells me that she suffers from that too. Is that the negative side of creativity, the darkness of it? \u201cThe self-doubt? I suppose so. But it\u2019s also a complicated mix of things when there\u2019s an audience involved, when there\u2019s\u2026\u201d \u2013she adopts a melodramatic voice \u2013 \u201c<em>public humiliation looming</em>.\u201d She corrects herself, with an arch smile. \u201c<em>Potential</em> public humiliation looming.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cYou know, you just want to protect yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Zellweger has the impostor syndrome under control now: \u201cNot so much that I\u2019d ever take anything for granted \u2013 that I\u2019d ever sleep while I was doing something, lest I miss something,\u201d she says wryly. \u201cBut it manifests a bit differently now. I can shut \u2018her\u2019 up a little more quickly.\u201d Zellweger has won Oscars, Golden Globes, Baftas and more \u2013 it must get to the point of \u201cHey, I can do this!\u201d Zellweger smiles, shifts in her seat. \u201cI don\u2019t really look it that way, I don\u2019t judge it\u2026 I just look at it as \u2013 that was that moment, and now this is this moment\u2026 It\u2019s kind of like education, I suppose \u2013 it stays with you. It doesn\u2019t mean you should stop learning.\u201d</p> <p><em>Judy is in UK cinemas from 2 October</em></p>",

Person who\u2019s meant a lot to me and millions, through generations.\u201d Judy is also about the cruelty of the old Hollywood studio system \u2013 with scenes showing the young Judy (Darci Shaw) being controlled, nagged about her weight, and started on a regime of uppers and downers that would ruin her for life. Zellweger says that thankfully there are stricter child labour laws these days. As to whether modern female performers are better off generally, she\u2019s uncertain: \u201cBecause you see the Amy Winehouse documentary\u2026\u201d Garland\u2019s daughter, Liza Minnelli, criticised Judy \u2013 posting on her Facebook page that she wasn\u2019t sanctioning the film, and had never met nor spoken to Zellweger, writing: \u201cAny reports to the contrary are 100% fiction.\u201d Does Zellweger think that was because Minnelli hadn\u2019t seen Judy, and would find any film about her mother difficult? There\u2019s a pause while Zellweger considers the question. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says eventually. \u201cI wish she was here so we could chat!\u201d Speaking to her, it\u2019s clear that Zellweger took pains to avoid producing an \u201cimpersonation\u201d or a caricature of Garland. \u201cShe\u2019s such a legend. But there\u2019s so much to the human being as well. You want her to come across as big as she was, but also show the woman\u2026 Her intelligence, determination, tenacity, hope. She never gave that up, no matter the circumstances.\u201d Zellweger, 50, grew up in Katy, Texas, and studied at the University of Texas in Austin. \u201cI consider Austin home, and I have a lot of extended family there, so I get back a lot,\u201d she says. From early childhood, she wanted to be a writer. \u201cWhen the Easter bunny was coming, I would always wish for the same thing \u2013 I loved a tablet of fresh ruled paper and sharp pencils. There\u2019s nothing better \u2013 stories, poetry, the possibilities were endless.\u201d Her mother was Norwegian, and her father Swiss, which made her feel different. \u201cI very much feel my Texan roots, but there\u2019s no denying that I\u2019m a child of European people.\u201d While at university, she \u201cfell\u201d into acting roles. \u201cRather than continue on to get my journalism degree, I finished up quickly with my lit degree, just to see where [acting] would go,\u201d she says. \u201cI figured I could always go back and get a master\u2019s, and finally submit to the Daily Texan!\u201d There seems a certain piquancy to Zellweger aiming to become a journalist when she must have often felt like media prey. Then again, Zellweger tells me that she usually has no problems wandering around incognito. She famously stepped back from screen-acting for six years in 2010, and thinks that helps her in the street. \u201cTaking that time away, when you\u2019re not in people\u2019s consciousness, they think: \u2018Oh yeah, she looks like somebody, maybe, but, um, who? I don\u2019t know\u2026\u2019\u201d Zellweger gives her distinctive throaty chuckle: \u201cI sneak around really, really well.\u201d She\u2019s also good at being private, despite high profile relationships, including Jim Carrey, Jack White, a short marriage to Kenny Chesney, Bradley Cooper and, latterly, musician Doyle Bramhall II (just before I meet her, there are rumours that they\u2019d split). Is she in a relationship? Zellweger laughs airily: \u201cI\u2019m in a million relationships!\u201d She says she doesn\u2019t find it difficult to have a personal life: \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult at all. You just don\u2019t talk about it, you don\u2019t post it\u2026 I know it\u2019s so boring when you\u2019re trying to talk to an actress and she\u2019s being all cryptic and whatever. But I like to keep it\u2026\u201d \u2013 she mimes a zipping action \u2013 \u201cI just do.\u201d It\u2019s also about work: \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to be an actor who disappears when you have no mystery.\u201d It\u2019s a distraction when there\u2019s too much of a public persona? \u201cYeah, I think a little mystery never hurt a girl.\u201d I\u2019d been wondering whether it\u2019s partly about how roles such as Bridget Jones utilise Zellweger\u2019s everywoman quality (warmth, approachability) \u2013 when people feel they know someone, maybe there\u2019s also an element of feeling they own them? Whatever\u2019s going on, Zellweger says it doesn\u2019t \u201cexist\u201d for her, because she doesn\u2019t read, watch, or in any way seek out what people are saying about her. She just ignores it? \u201cYeah, because there\u2019s no upside to not ignoring it. I wouldn\u2019t learn anything from it. It wouldn\u2019t be helpful. What would I do? Explain myself? Or try to somehow mitigate a rumour that someone has started? It seems like a lot of wasted energy to me. I could just be with my dogs, or FaceTime my nephew, or work on writing something. That\u2019s a lot of energy that you would just sort of haemorrhage. All day. On things that you can\u2019t control anyway. And why would you want to?\u201d One thing Zellweger did respond to was the Elle Woman in Hollywood awards furore, which could only be described as a global pile-on \u2013 for a while, it seemed like the entire world was accusing her of having plastic surgery. As it happens, the day I meet her, Zellweger looks exactly like herself, but that\u2019s not the point \u2013 even if those 2014 photos did look unlike her, it doesn\u2019t justify what she endured. Zellweger ended up penning an article for the Huffington Post, titled \u201cWe can do better\u201d. She wrote: \u201cNot that it\u2019s anyone\u2019s business, but I did not make a decision to alter my face and have surgery on my eyes\u201d \u2013 but the article was about much more than that, debating everything from intrusion to women\u2019s worth. To make sure I\u2019m not putting words into her mouth, I double-check with Zellweger that she wrote it (she did). It\u2019s not only an impressive, erudite read (the inner writer is on full beam), it\u2019s also brave. \u201cIt just felt necessary,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2013 was it really brave \u2013 if there\u2019s no consequence?\u201d She didn\u2019t know that when she wrote it. \u201cYeah, I did, I did,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing that\u2019s going to happen? What else could be said? How else could I have been made fun of? Or whatever happened\u2026 I know what that felt like, and I survived it, so what else?\u201d Zellweger was also dragged into #MeToo. As part of the ongoing class-action lawsuit, actor Melissa Sagemiller claimed that Harvey Weinstein told her that Zellweger and Charlize Theron had given \u201csexual favours\u201d for roles. There was a robust response from the Zellweger camp: \u201cIf Harvey said that, he\u2019s full of shit.\u201d (Though Zellweger says she didn\u2019t personally put out a statement about it.) Regarding what Weinstein is alleged to have said about her, Zellweger says: \u201cI did hear about that, yes.\u201d Generally speaking, did Zellweger have any bad experiences in the industry? \u201cNever directly in that way. But, you know, there were certain behaviours that I would tolerate because I had a job to do, and I was more interested in getting through the day than in correcting someone, certainly. They weren\u2019t offences of the variety that you\u2019re referencing. But there were certain languages and liberties that certain people would take. But they would take them from anyone, in my estimation, not just me as a woman. But I\u2019m sure there were countless instances that I was not aware of \u2013 in terms of deals that were made and conversations that were had, that were derogatory, that I was not privy to. Sure. Of course. I\u2019d be naive to think that I was immune.\u201d Zellweger identifies as a feminist, and admires the women who came forward: \u201cIt gives you strength in numbers, doesn\u2019t it? It enables you to, in some way, begin to heal.\u201d She seems cautiously optimistic about changes in Hollywood: \u201cI think it\u2019s also right at this very delicate moment where there\u2019s fear and so everybody is hyper-aware of the decisions that they make and what they say\u2026 It will be really interesting to see where it settles. But change is inevitable because there\u2019s this new generation of women who are coming of age, and producing things, in every industry, not just Hollywood. They\u2019re not waiting for permission because they don\u2019t need to \u2013 and it never occurred to them that they needed to.\u201d Considering the relentless nature of Hollywood, Zellweger\u2019s six-year career break was a gamble. Was it a work-sabbatical, a fame-sabbatical, or a combination of both? \u201cI needed to take care of myself,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was more about being bored with myself, bored with my performances, and drawing on the same experiences, it just felt like regurgitated life, and I needed to collect some life experiences because the well was a bit dry. And I hadn\u2019t grown in any way for years\u2026 It\u2019s just redundancy. Because while the experiences were once-in-a-lifetime, dream-come-true blessings, there\u2019s not really room for anything else. And I needed to learn something else. I needed to grow as a person. To grow up a little bit. And I needed to physically take care of myself\u2026 But I didn\u2019t stop working, I still worked, just in a different capacity. I can\u2019t be idle.\u201d She has a work ethic? \u201cOh yes!\u201d The interview is winding to a close. Does Zellweger have any reaction to the US political climate? \u201cEvery day!\u201d Around the time we meet, President Trump has told four congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they originally came from (three of the four women were in fact born in America). Does this kind of thing concern her? \u201cEvery day,\u201d repeats Zellweger. \u201cOf course\u2026 It\u2019s very upsetting. And it\u2019s upsetting that it\u2019s not as upsetting to as many folks as it should be.\u201d Zellweger isn\u2019t able to confirm her forthcoming projects, not even if there\u2019s definitely going to be another Bridget Jones film: \u201cI\u2019m not being coy, I promise. I\u2019m always the last to know\u2026 I do know that Helen [Fielding] has written a book, so maybe.\u201d Zellweger once spoke about suffering from impostor syndrome \u2013 could that just be a human thing? \u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a human thing. For most people\u2026 There are brain surgeons and whatnot who have to have a different kind of certitude about their skill.\u201d Might it affect women more? \u201cThat we don\u2019t feel entitled to whatever it is that we\u2019ve worked for? That\u2019s possibly true.\u201d Stage fright ate Garland alive, and Zellweger tells me that she suffers from that too. Is that the negative side of creativity, the darkness of it? \u201cThe self-doubt? I suppose so. But it\u2019s also a complicated mix of things when there\u2019s an audience involved, when there\u2019s\u2026\u201d \u2013she adopts a melodramatic voice \u2013 \u201cpublic humiliation looming.\u201d She corrects herself, with an arch smile. \u201cPotential public humiliation looming.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cYou know, you just want to protect yourself.\u201d Zellweger has the impostor syndrome under control now: \u201cNot so much that I\u2019d ever take anything for granted \u2013 that I\u2019d ever sleep while I was doing something, lest I miss something,\u201d she says wryly. \u201cBut it manifests a bit differently now. I can shut \u2018her\u2019 up a little more quickly.\u201d Zellweger has won Oscars, Golden Globes, Baftas and more \u2013 it must get to the point of \u201cHey, I can do this!\u201d Zellweger smiles, shifts in her seat. \u201cI don\u2019t really look it that way, I don\u2019t judge it\u2026 I just look at it as \u2013 that was that moment, and now this is this moment\u2026 It\u2019s kind of like education, I suppose \u2013 it stays with you. It doesn\u2019t mean you should stop learning.\u201d Judy is in UK cinemas from 2 October",

Turds had compared himself, as he had many times before, to the Hulk while talking to a comic shop owner in Newport market, where he was booed by ex-miners and mocked with a hash cake. Hulk creatives were quick to deny Turds\u2019s appropriation of the character.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that Boris Johnson slightly missed the point of it all,\u201d Hulk artist Gary Frank told this paper at the time, \u201cin that Hulk\u2019s alter ego, Bruce Banner, doesn\u2019t actually want to get angry, become stupid and then smash everything to fuck. Do you think Boris Johnson misread the Hulk comics as a sort of Tony Robbins self-help guide to fulfilling your potential?\u201d</p> <p>During his Tory party leadership campaign, Boris boasted of his love of buses, and his favoured bus company Wrightbus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/25/wrightbus-goes-into-administration-1400-jobs-routemaster-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">went into voluntary administration </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/25/wrightbus-goes-into-administration-1400-jobs-routemaster-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">last week,</a> despite turning a huge profit, because bosses suddenly felt the very idea of a bus was now tainted beyond redemption.</p> <p>To date, the American model and businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri, star of the Bollywood sex comedy <em>Naughty @ Forty</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/johnson-ally-helped-pm-tech-boss-friend-jennifer-arcuri-commons-event\" title=\"\">of whom Turds is a huge fan</a>, is the only artist the prime minister likes yet to make a public statement disassociating themselves from his enthusiasm for their work.</p> <p>Given that most of the artists Turds reveals affection for immediately try to sever their links to the lying PM, I wondered how the fire-stealing Prometheus himself felt about being cited by Turds at the United Nations as a metaphor for Brexit.

The Godfather is Turds\u2019s favourite film and includes the lines: \u201cLawyers can steal more money with a briefcase than a thousand men with guns and masks\u201d; \u201cI have no intention of placing my fate in the hands of men whose only qualification is that they managed to con a block of people to vote for them\u201d; and \u201cWe are all honourable men here. We do not have to give each other assurances as if we were lawyers.\u201d Having heard, on 9 September, that Turds was a Godfather fan, the usually reclusive director Francis Ford Coppola broke his monastic silence to tell the Financial News\u2019s Tom Teodorczuk he hoped his work would not provide \u201cencouragement to someone I see is about to bring the beloved United Kingdom to ruin\u201d. Ooh! Ooooh!! Ouch!!! The Godfather, it should be noted, also includes the line: \u201cA man who is not a father to his children can never be a real man\u201d, particularly if his own Wikipedia page is unable to say exactly how many children he has, or what their names are. And I believe it was also I who, two years ahead of the cultural curve as usual, first exposed Turds\u2019s suddenly celebrated Hulk fixation in this very paper, on 21 May 2017. Turds had compared himself, as he had many times before, to the Hulk while talking to a comic shop owner in Newport market, where he was booed by ex-miners and mocked with a hash cake. Hulk creatives were quick to deny Turds\u2019s appropriation of the character. \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that Boris Johnson slightly missed the point of it all,\u201d Hulk artist Gary Frank told this paper at the time, \u201cin that Hulk\u2019s alter ego, Bruce Banner, doesn\u2019t actually want to get angry, become stupid and then smash everything to fuck. Do you think Boris Johnson misread the Hulk comics as a sort of Tony Robbins self-help guide to fulfilling your potential?\u201d During his Tory party leadership campaign, Boris boasted of his love of buses, and his favoured bus company Wrightbus went into voluntary administration last week, despite turning a huge profit, because bosses suddenly felt the very idea of a bus was now tainted beyond redemption. To date, the American model and businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri, star of the Bollywood sex comedy Naughty @ Forty, of whom Turds is a huge fan, is the only artist the prime minister likes yet to make a public statement disassociating themselves from his enthusiasm for their work. Given that most of the artists Turds reveals affection for immediately try to sever their links to the lying PM, I wondered how the fire-stealing Prometheus himself felt about being cited by Turds at the United Nations as a metaphor for Brexit. So I held tight to the feet of the owl of Athena, as it swept me on the space-winds to the rock upon which the mythic titan himself lies eternally chained, his liver perpetually pecked by an eagle. Raising his head from the blood-soaked slab, Prometheus said he was pleased I had mentioned him in the Observer earlier this month. His role, as he understands it, is to provide a mythical archetype to help humanity understand its own predicament, and he sometimes feels he is having his liver pecked out every day for no real reason. But Prometheus disagrees with the comparison of his predicament to Brexit. \u201cNo. Boris Johnson himself is Prometheus,\u201d he explained, \u201ctrapped in office and pecked to pieces every day by parliament. I thought he studied classics at Eton. Ow ow, my liver!\u201d Stewart Lee\u2019s new book, March of the Lemmings, is available now. And his new standup show, Snowflake/Tornado, is at the Leicester Square theatre, London from 29 October, with national dates from February 2020",

People who voted Leave in 2016 have a right to be angry. If you backed Remain and Remain had won, but politicians were still intent on taking Britain out of the EU, you would be angry too.</p> <p>But Leave anger is based on a sly rewriting of history. Boris Johnson is refashioning the Tory party into an English nationalist party. We won, his message goes. Parliament voted to trigger article 50. MPs promised to deliver Brexit, and now they are betraying it. Demagoguery is the last, best hope of a desperate PM.</p> <p>The Brexit stab-in-the-back myth deceives because it can never admit that the 2016 referendum was bound to be betrayed. David Cameron\u2019s curse on Britain was to allow the British to vote for Brexit without defining what Brexit meant. Cummings\u2019s Vote Leave was grateful for the free pass. It too refused to say what the public was voting for, because Cummings, Michael Gove and Johnson wanted no part of an \u201cunwinnable\u201d debate. In any case, <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2015/06/23/on-the-referendum-6-exit-plans-and-a-second-referendum/\" title=\"\">as Cummings said</a>, \u201cEurosceptic groups have been divided for years\u201d about what Brexit meant \u2013 as the British have learnt to our cost.</p> <p>The Conservatives created a country in which any form of Brexit would be a betrayal. Politicians who are today conjuring up popular uprisings and accusing their colleagues of breaking their word helped vote down Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. Can we honour the referendum and stay in the single market? Or the customs union? There is no right answer to a question that was not posed in 2016.</p> <p>Even if Nigel Farage, Cummings and Johnson crash us out, workers who lose jobs and patients who are denied medicines will be able to claim they have been betrayed because the 2016 referendum did not mandate a no-deal exit. (And, as we are talking blood in the gutters, I should add that the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/operation-yellowhammer-fears-no-deal-brexit-chaos-forced-to-publish-secret-papers\" title=\"\">Yellowhammer report</a> on the price of no deal warned of \u201ca rise in public disorder and community tensions\u201d.)</p> <p>I have read Cameron\u2019s memoirs and can report that the overpromoted, overprivileged fool shows no understanding of how his actions brought party and country to this pass. Instead he chirrups that \u201cour best days are ahead of us\u201d. While we await Cameron\u2019s New Jerusalem, the authorities must watch over all who run for public office. The Conservatives cut the police service that might protect them \u2013 to the point where it cannot solve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/17/figures-less-than-5-of-burglaries-and-robberies-in-uk-solved\" title=\"\">95% of burglaries and robberies</a>.

      "bodyText": "If a malign power wanted to push a peaceful country into political violence, it would follow the example of the British Conservative party. For violence to come from the fringe to the mainstream two conditions must be met: the taboos against violence must be undermined and the forces of order weakened. The Tories have met them both. Political violence needs authorisation from above. Politicians, intellectuals and religious leaders either issue a call to arms or, more usually, find reasons to \u201cunderstand\u201d and excuse. In the manner of the sexist judge saying women in miniskirts are \u201casking for it\u201d, they divert attention from perpetrators and say victims have no one to blame but themselves. The right once condemned the left for \u201cwhatabouttery\u201d. Now Dominic Cummings tells MPs who are receiving death and rape threats that it was \u201cnot surprising some people are angry\u201d. A member of Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet hid behind the coward\u2019s cloak of anonymity and told the Times that Britain would have a \u201cviolent, popular uprising\u201d if Remain won a second referendum. Both invoked violence as a tactic to frighten opponents into line. The point is rarely made on these pages, so let me state it bluntly. People who voted Leave in 2016 have a right to be angry. If you backed Remain and Remain had won, but politicians were still intent on taking Britain out of the EU, you would be angry too. But Leave anger is based on a sly rewriting of history. Boris Johnson is refashioning the Tory party into an English nationalist party. We won, his message goes. Parliament voted to trigger article 50. MPs promised to deliver Brexit, and now they are betraying it. Demagoguery is the last, best hope of a desperate PM. The Brexit stab-in-the-back myth deceives because it can never admit that the 2016 referendum was bound to be betrayed. David Cameron\u2019s curse on Britain was to allow the British to vote for Brexit without defining what Brexit meant. Cummings\u2019s Vote Leave was grateful for the free pass. It too refused to say what the public was voting for, because Cummings, Michael Gove and Johnson wanted no part of an \u201cunwinnable\u201d debate. In any case, as Cummings said, \u201cEurosceptic groups have been divided for years\u201d about what Brexit meant \u2013 as the British have learnt to our cost. The Conservatives created a country in which any form of Brexit would be a betrayal. Politicians who are today conjuring up popular uprisings and accusing their colleagues of breaking their word helped vote down Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. Can we honour the referendum and stay in the single market? Or the customs union? There is no right answer to a question that was not posed in 2016. Even if Nigel Farage, Cummings and Johnson crash us out, workers who lose jobs and patients who are denied medicines will be able to claim they have been betrayed because the 2016 referendum did not mandate a no-deal exit. (And, as we are talking blood in the gutters, I should add that the government\u2019s Yellowhammer report on the price of no deal warned of \u201ca rise in public disorder and community tensions\u201d.) I have read Cameron\u2019s memoirs and can report that the overpromoted, overprivileged fool shows no understanding of how his actions brought party and country to this pass. Instead he chirrups that \u201cour best days are ahead of us\u201d. While we await Cameron\u2019s New Jerusalem, the authorities must watch over all who run for public office. The Conservatives cut the police service that might protect them \u2013 to the point where it cannot solve 95% of burglaries and robberies. In the words of the committee on standards in public life, political intimidation is now \u201ca threat to the very nature of representative democracy\u201d. Good candidates won\u2019t stand. The basic democratic condition that political ideas must be freely discussed in open debate has been undermined. In 2017, every single female MP who was active on Twitter reported online threats.

It was, as usual, an excruciating affair, full of turgid speeches and embarrassing links by the presenters. But amid this face-reddening fanfare the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, appealed to the audience of football celebrities on a serious matter. He noted that there had been another episode of racism in Italian football at the weekend and declared: \u201cWe have to say no to racism in whatever form.\u201d</p> <p>A short while later, Megan Rapinoe, winner of the women\u2019s player of the year award, ribbed Infantino for stealing her thunder because she wanted to be the person to address these issues. Then she name-checked \u201cRaheem Sterling and [Kalidou] Koulibaly\u201d for taking on racism. \u201cIf we really want to have meaningful change,\u201d she told the gathered stars, \u201cthen what I feel would be most inspiring would be if everybody other than Raheem Sterling and Koulibaly [was] as outraged about racism as they are.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/23/megan-rapinoe-fifa-best-awards-football-speech\">Megan Rapinoe speaks out against racism and homophobia in Fifa speech</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both were noble sentiments, but what do they actually mean? Almost as if to test that question, Conguitos\u2011gate was unfolding. Last Sunday Sterling\u2019s Manchester City teammate Bernardo Silva, the eloquent Portuguese midfielder, tweeted a photograph of another teammate, Benjamin Mendy, as a young child next to the cartoon that is the marketing symbol for the Spanish chocolate brand Conguitos \u2013 think of a Malteser with big red lips and large eyes. Above the images Silva wrote: \u201cGuess who?\u201d</p> <p>It got more than 6,000 likes, including one from Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, the black Paris Saint-Germain forward who appeared on stage at the Fifa event. Was the tweet racist? Silva insisted it was not and Mendy said he was not offended. But plenty of people thought it played on a racist caricature \u2013 and at the very least, one would say the logo looks as shamefully out of date as the late and not at all lamented Robertson\u2019s jam \u201cgolliwog\u201d mascot.</p> <p>Anyway, the tweet was deleted, the anti-racism charity Kick It Out said they were \u201cshocked\u201d, the Football Association complained to City, and Silva tweeted his own complaint: \u201cCan\u2019t even joke with a friend these days \u2026 you guys.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, Silva <em>can</em> joke with his friend \u2013 it was sharing it with more than 600,000 followers that caused the problem. But what level of outrage directed at Silva would Rapinoe find inspiring? Obviously more than Mbapp\u00e9 and Mendy displayed. More, too, than John Barnes, who said the tweet was not racist.</p> <p>And what can the authorities do to say no to racism, as Infantino instructed? There was talk of banning Silva for six matches. Or perhaps he needs to be sent away to a re-education camp \u2013 that is also a joke, Bernardo.</p> <p>Here lies the problem with racism and combating it with outrage. First off, very few people actually believe they are racist. The week before Silva\u2019s tweet Peter Beardsley was found guilty of using racist language when he was a youth coach at Newcastle and banned from football for 32 weeks. An FA independent panel found that the former England forward had called a black player a \u201cmonkey\u201d during a game of head tennis and, on a team-building trip to the adventure park Go Ape, told black players: \u201cYou should be used to that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2a9c98941933c56a52aba108a54d5600fdd95ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2a9c98941933c56a52aba108a54d5600fdd95ae/0_273_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Amiens captain Prince Gouano points to a Dijon supporter who racially abused him during a Ligue 1 match in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Amiens captain Prince Gouano points to a Dijon supporter who racially abused him during a Ligue 1 match in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the panel stated it did not think Beardsley was racist. And nor, apparently, does he. Really? \u201cMonkey?\u201d \u201cGo Ape \u2013 you should be used to that?\u201d What was he thinking? The answer, almost certainly, is he wasn\u2019t thinking. And nor I suspect was Silva. Neither of them would sign up to a campaign that said \u201cYes to racism\u201d. For them it was all just \u201cbanter\u201d.</p> <p>With obvious exceptions, racism is nt usually overt but largely an insidious, unexamined process, an accumulation of negative ideas and images \u2013 of which I would say the Conguitos mascot is a small but not inconsequential part \u2013 that eventually come bursting forth from the reptilian depths of inflamed minds.</p> <p>Last weekend those ugly depths came to the surface at the National League match between Hartlepool and Dover, which was nearly called off after Dover\u2019s Inih Effiong was racially abused by a small group of fans. But why should a few racists stop a match? And what happens when a player is targeted because his wife had an affair or due to homophobia? Should those matches be called off, too?</p> <p>Racism is structural at its base. Sterling was on to something when last year he drew a contrast between how two young Manchester City players \u2013 one black, one white \u2013 were treated in press reports about their buying expensive houses for their mothers. One was celebrated, the other portrayed as flash. As Stan Collymore said at the time: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a genius \u2026 to figure out which is which.\u201d Collymore went on to blame the lack of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in the media for the problem. Doubtless it is an important factor. But it is also a little more complex than that. The <em>Daily Mail</em> journalist who wrote the story Sterling criticised was himself from an Asian background.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/17/megan-rapinoe-everything-trump-loves-except-we-are-powerful-women\">Megan Rapinoe: 'We're everything Trump loves \u2013 except that we're powerful women'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately it will not be the demise of the Conguitos mascot or unfair stories about black footballers that spells the end of racism but both will be signs that we are heading in the right direction.</p> <p>In many respects football leads the argument against racial prejudice. It is an impressively diverse environment, at least among the players \u2013 the coaching side has a long way to go (hence the survival of Beardsley\u2019s approach to team bonding).</p> <p>But, if Fifa and its continental counterparts really want to say no to racism, they have a role to play, particularly with large-scale examples of it. One happened this year in Montenegro, where locals racially abused Sterling during the match with England. Such incidents should, in the first instance, lead to teams having to play behind closed doors for several matches \u2013 Montenegro were punished by Uefa for one match.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Recap\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Recap: our pick of the best Guardian sport content.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The game\u2019s authorities should have no problem banning guilty fans because they have allowed the banning of innocent ones for many years. Rapinoe, in her speech, said she was inspired by the \u201cyoung Iranian woman who eventually set herself on fire because she wasn\u2019t able to go to the game\u201d. She did not get a name-check but she was called Sahar Khodayari and she killed herself early this month after she was charged with committing a \u201csinful act\u201d \u2013 ie, trying to watch an Iranian men\u2019s football match.</p> <p>Infantino now claims he has got Iran to admit women to future matches. But why has it taken so long? How has Iran (Saudi Arabia, too, until last year) been allowed to compete in Fifa competitions while preventing half its population from watching? Perhaps Fifa feared that, if it penalised such nations, it would be accused of racism. That would be a terrible irony.</p> <p>Expressing outrage about racism is necessary. But it should never be confused with what it takes to stop it.</p>",

But amid this face-reddening fanfare the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, appealed to the audience of football celebrities on a serious matter. He noted that there had been another episode of racism in Italian football at the weekend and declared: \u201cWe have to say no to racism in whatever form.\u201d A short while later, Megan Rapinoe, winner of the women\u2019s player of the year award, ribbed Infantino for stealing her thunder because she wanted to be the person to address these issues. Then she name-checked \u201cRaheem Sterling and [Kalidou] Koulibaly\u201d for taking on racism. \u201cIf we really want to have meaningful change,\u201d she told the gathered stars, \u201cthen what I feel would be most inspiring would be if everybody other than Raheem Sterling and Koulibaly [was] as outraged about racism as they are.\u201d Both were noble sentiments, but what do they actually mean? Almost as if to test that question, Conguitos\u2011gate was unfolding. Last Sunday Sterling\u2019s Manchester City teammate Bernardo Silva, the eloquent Portuguese midfielder, tweeted a photograph of another teammate, Benjamin Mendy, as a young child next to the cartoon that is the marketing symbol for the Spanish chocolate brand Conguitos \u2013 think of a Malteser with big red lips and large eyes. Above the images Silva wrote: \u201cGuess who?\u201d It got more than 6,000 likes, including one from Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, the black Paris Saint-Germain forward who appeared on stage at the Fifa event. Was the tweet racist? Silva insisted it was not and Mendy said he was not offended. But plenty of people thought it played on a racist caricature \u2013 and at the very least, one would say the logo looks as shamefully out of date as the late and not at all lamented Robertson\u2019s jam \u201cgolliwog\u201d mascot. Anyway, the tweet was deleted, the anti-racism charity Kick It Out said they were \u201cshocked\u201d, the Football Association complained to City, and Silva tweeted his own complaint: \u201cCan\u2019t even joke with a friend these days \u2026 you guys.\u201d Of course, Silva can joke with his friend \u2013 it was sharing it with more than 600,000 followers that caused the problem. But what level of outrage directed at Silva would Rapinoe find inspiring? Obviously more than Mbapp\u00e9 and Mendy displayed. More, too, than John Barnes, who said the tweet was not racist. And what can the authorities do to say no to racism, as Infantino instructed? There was talk of banning Silva for six matches. Or perhaps he needs to be sent away to a re-education camp \u2013 that is also a joke, Bernardo. Here lies the problem with racism and combating it with outrage. First off, very few people actually believe they are racist. The week before Silva\u2019s tweet Peter Beardsley was found guilty of using racist language when he was a youth coach at Newcastle and banned from football for 32 weeks. An FA independent panel found that the former England forward had called a black player a \u201cmonkey\u201d during a game of head tennis and, on a team-building trip to the adventure park Go Ape, told black players: \u201cYou should be used to that.\u201d But the panel stated it did not think Beardsley was racist. And nor, apparently, does he. Really? \u201cMonkey?\u201d \u201cGo Ape \u2013 you should be used to that?\u201d What was he thinking? The answer, almost certainly, is he wasn\u2019t thinking. And nor I suspect was Silva. Neither of them would sign up to a campaign that said \u201cYes to racism\u201d. For them it was all just \u201cbanter\u201d. With obvious exceptions, racism is nt usually overt but largely an insidious, unexamined process, an accumulation of negative ideas and images \u2013 of which I would say the Conguitos mascot is a small but not inconsequential part \u2013 that eventually come bursting forth from the reptilian depths of inflamed minds. Last weekend those ugly depths came to the surface at the National League match between Hartlepool and Dover, which was nearly called off after Dover\u2019s Inih Effiong was racially abused by a small group of fans. But why should a few racists stop a match? And what happens when a player is targeted because his wife had an affair or due to homophobia? Should those matches be called off, too? Racism is structural at its base. Sterling was on to something when last year he drew a contrast between how two young Manchester City players \u2013 one black, one white \u2013 were treated in press reports about their buying expensive houses for their mothers. One was celebrated, the other portrayed as flash. As Stan Collymore said at the time: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a genius \u2026 to figure out which is which.\u201d Collymore went on to blame the lack of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in the media for the problem. Doubtless it is an important factor. But it is also a little more complex than that. The Daily Mail journalist who wrote the story Sterling criticised was himself from an Asian background. Ultimately it will not be the demise of the Conguitos mascot or unfair stories about black footballers that spells the end of racism but both will be signs that we are heading in the right direction. In many respects football leads the argument against racial prejudice. It is an impressively diverse environment, at least among the players \u2013 the coaching side has a long way to go (hence the survival of Beardsley\u2019s approach to team bonding). But, if Fifa and its continental counterparts really want to say no to racism, they have a role to play, particularly with large-scale examples of it. One happened this year in Montenegro, where locals racially abused Sterling during the match with England. Such incidents should, in the first instance, lead to teams having to play behind closed doors for several matches \u2013 Montenegro were punished by Uefa for one match. The game\u2019s authorities should have no problem banning guilty fans because they have allowed the banning of innocent ones for many years. Rapinoe, in her speech, said she was inspired by the \u201cyoung Iranian woman who eventually set herself on fire because she wasn\u2019t able to go to the game\u201d. She did not get a name-check but she was called Sahar Khodayari and she killed herself early this month after she was charged with committing a \u201csinful act\u201d \u2013 ie, trying to watch an Iranian men\u2019s football match. Infantino now claims he has got Iran to admit women to future matches. But why has it taken so long? How has Iran (Saudi Arabia, too, until last year) been allowed to compete in Fifa competitions while preventing half its population from watching? Perhaps Fifa feared that, if it penalised such nations, it would be accused of racism. That would be a terrible irony. Expressing outrage about racism is necessary. But it should never be confused with what it takes to stop it.",

In 1933, aged 11, he started taking classes at the Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts, which even gave him his own room in which to work. Later, his admirers included the art patron Peggy Guggenheim. His debut solo exhibition, when he was 23, inspired leading critic Clement Greenberg to write: \u201cGuggenheim has discovered another important young abstract painter.\u201d</p> <p>In the book, former museum curator Charles Stuckey describes De Niro Sr as among the most respected artists in the New York of the 1940s and 1950s: \u201cBut like many of his equally ambitious contemporaries \u2026 De Niro has too often been omitted from accounts of the so-called New York School.\u201d The book notes that the artist experienced financial and professional hardships throughout his life.</p> <p>His son has been described as the greatest movie actor of his generation. His latest film, <em>The Irishman</em>, marks his ninth feature film with Martin Scorsese. The pair worked on <em>Taxi Driver</em>, for which De Niro was nominated for an Oscar, and <em>Raging Bull</em>, for which he won the award.</p> <p>De Niro said of his father: \u201cWhen I started doing well in acting, I helped him.\u201d Asked whether his father\u2019s struggle was all the more difficult against his own success, he said: \u201cHe was very proud of me.

But I really don\u2019t want my homosexuality to be cured.\u201d Elsewhere he said: \u201cI am full of fear ... of the discomfort caused by my own thoughts, feelings, sensations and impulses.\u201d He even questioned the validity of keeping a journal: \u201cThere is so much I have left out of this journal \u2026 My laments, wailings, self-pity and complaining are much greater than I have [indicated] here.\u201d Such passages are all the more difficult for his son to read as De Niro Sr did not discuss his anxieties with him, or at least only in \u201cvague ways\u201d. Although his father\u2019s works were acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among other galleries, De Niro Sr lived \u201ca classic artist\u2019s life in a studio that was a mess\u201d, his son recalls. Born in Syracuse, New York, into an Irish-Italian household, De Niro Sr was a child prodigy. In 1933, aged 11, he started taking classes at the Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts, which even gave him his own room in which to work. Later, his admirers included the art patron Peggy Guggenheim. His debut solo exhibition, when he was 23, inspired leading critic Clement Greenberg to write: \u201cGuggenheim has discovered another important young abstract painter.\u201d In the book, former museum curator Charles Stuckey describes De Niro Sr as among the most respected artists in the New York of the 1940s and 1950s: \u201cBut like many of his equally ambitious contemporaries \u2026 De Niro has too often been omitted from accounts of the so-called New York School.\u201d The book notes that the artist experienced financial and professional hardships throughout his life. His son has been described as the greatest movie actor of his generation. His latest film, The Irishman, marks his ninth feature film with Martin Scorsese. The pair worked on Taxi Driver, for which De Niro was nominated for an Oscar, and Raging Bull, for which he won the award. De Niro said of his father: \u201cWhen I started doing well in acting, I helped him.\u201d Asked whether his father\u2019s struggle was all the more difficult against his own success, he said: \u201cHe was very proud of me. At the same time, part of him might have been saying, \u2018I wish I had some success too\u2019. He always used to say to me \u2018great artists are recognised many, many years after they\u2019re gone\u2019.\u201d Growing up, De Niro did not realise his father\u2019s torment over his homosexuality: \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of that \u2026 My mother told me once later, when I was a young adult, sort of inferred. I sort of understood.\u201d Father and son shared a pride in each other\u2019s work, never feeling the need to express it in words: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we sat down and he told me, \u2018I like this movie\u2019 \u2026 But I know he was proud.\u201d In the journals, De Niro Sr refers to his son, writing that he was \u201cgetting all sorts of movie and stage offers\u201d, and adding: \u201cMy little baby-doll has grown up.\u201d In another passage, he wrote of his son: \u201cHe is tanned from a sunlamp \u2013 for his new movie part \u2013 and looks much better than when he returned from Italy two weeks ago. I wanted to run my fingers through his hair and to kiss him, but I hardly think that he would have appreciated it.\u201d In 2014, De Niro made an HBO documentary on his father. The journals were cited, but only a tiny percentage has been published.",

She was halfway through her psychiatrist\u2019s training and had passed all the exams young doctors have to sit when starting out on their careers.</p> <p>\u201cDoctors love their jobs, and most wouldn\u2019t do anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our vocation to care for our patients. However, the level of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/16/doctors-turn-to-alcohol-food-and-drugs-to-cope-with-work-stress\" title=\"\">stress endured by frontline NHS staff</a> is unbelievable. Understaffing leaves doctors feeling isolated and stretched. There is often pressure to take on more patients, to work extra shifts, to stretch themselves thinner and thinner.\u201d</p> <p>Patterson left behind a service that she says has been left \u201ccut back to its very bones\u201d after nine years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/10/10-english-nhs-hospital-trusts-overspend-by-850m\" title=\"\">austerity funding</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis is felt every day on the NHS frontline and in every patient encounter. Trying to give care when you don\u2019t have \u2018enough\u2019 is heartbreaking. There is no longer enough time, enough staff, enough resources. It chips away at you daily: and your morale becomes broken. Doctors are stretched because so many of our colleagues have left \u2013 left the country for places that support them better or left the profession altogether.</p> <p>\u201cAs each doctor leaves, it becomes harder to sustain a safe service for our patients. The gaps become wider and deeper. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2018/apr/23/burnt-out-doctor-why-matters\" title=\"\">stress levels increase</a>.\u201d</p> <p>In her new role as a co-ordinator of both campaign group <a href=\"https://www.everydoctor.org.uk/\" title=\"\">EveryDoctor</a>, which works to improve doctors\u2019 working lives and runs <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheDoctorsAssociationUK/\" title=\"\">The Political Mess</a>, an online forum, Patterson, who is 33, hears daily about the pressures medics are under. \u201cStress is endemic and burnout is common. Our more experienced doctors report that things have never been worse.\u201d</p> <p>The NHS in England alone is short of almost 10,000 medics. The result of all this is that worryingly large numbers of doctors are giving up either during their training or after experiencing the realities of working in an NHS that is visibly struggling to cope, or are retiring early. GPs and hospital doctors alike feel forced out or are glad to have left their jobs at a time when the health service needs them more than ever. Some, as Patterson adds, kill themselves.</p> <p>New findings shared exclusively with the <em>Observer</em> by legal support service the <a href=\"https://www.medicalprotection.org/\" title=\"\">Medical Protection Society</a> (MPS) confirm the deep discontent in Britain\u2019s medical profession. It has found that 52% of doctors working in the UK are dissatisfied with their work-life balance, 46% feel guilty about taking time off, and almost 40% believe their employer does not give them the support they need to do their job well.</p> <p>\u201cThese are sobering findings,\u201d said the society\u2019s president, Professor Dame Jane Dacre, who until 2018 was president of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP), which represents many hospital doctors in England.</p> <p>\u201cThey tell us that the human impact of all these things \u2013 rota gaps, austerity, low morale, working in hospitals with paint peeling off the walls and equipment that doesn\u2019t work, and not feeling that you can do your best for patients \u2013 is becoming disproportionate and is undermining doctors\u2019 sense of vocation.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the most telling statistic to emerge from an MPS survey of 275 UK doctors is that more than a third have considered moving abroad to safeguard their personal wellbeing. In addition, 68% said time for rest and recovery during often long shifts was not the norm, while 57% felt unable to take even a short break in between two clinically demanding procedures.</p> <p>While the sample was small, its conclusions tally with the growing evidence that more and more doctors feel unable to cope with the demands placed on them.</p> <p>Dacre visited 80% of England\u2019s hospitals during her time at the RCP. \u201cAt each hospital,\u201d she recalled, \u201cwe held open forums for doctors to come and talk about things that were on their minds. But very often open forums became like open season. The picture that emerged was of an unhappy and frustrated medical workforce.</p> <p>\u201cIt was heartbreaking to see these articulate, intelligent, empathic and skilled people feeling undervalued, under-resourced, demotivated, crushed and wanting to leave \u2013 despite medicine being the thing they loved doing. Burnout was endemic.\u201d</p> <p>Doctors are trained to get diagnoses and treatment right \u2013 because lives depend on it. They face many frustrations: long hours of unpaid overtime, often antisocial working hours, and an inability to rest, eat or drink easily on a night shift, as well as bullying and pressure from managers to see more patients. But what is worse for them, says Dacre, is a feeling that they can\u2019t be proud of the standard of care they are providing because there are too few staff, too many demands and too little time.</p> <p>Details of the government\u2019s NHS People Plan for England are due in the next few weeks. But with staff shortages now so routine, easing doctors\u2019 burden may not be simple.</p> <p>\u201cThese are people that deal with death, emergency situations, other people\u2019s misfortunes on a daily basis,\u201d said Dacre. \u201cThey save lives. Somebody needs to start thinking about saving them.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 September 2019 to clarify that the online forum The Political Mess is run by EveryDoctor, not the Doctors\u2019 Association UK.</p>",

Doctors are stretched because so many of our colleagues have left \u2013 left the country for places that support them better or left the profession altogether. \u201cAs each doctor leaves, it becomes harder to sustain a safe service for our patients. The gaps become wider and deeper. The stress levels increase.\u201d In her new role as a co-ordinator of both campaign group EveryDoctor, which works to improve doctors\u2019 working lives and runs The Political Mess, an online forum, Patterson, who is 33, hears daily about the pressures medics are under. \u201cStress is endemic and burnout is common. Our more experienced doctors report that things have never been worse.\u201d The NHS in England alone is short of almost 10,000 medics. The result of all this is that worryingly large numbers of doctors are giving up either during their training or after experiencing the realities of working in an NHS that is visibly struggling to cope, or are retiring early. GPs and hospital doctors alike feel forced out or are glad to have left their jobs at a time when the health service needs them more than ever. Some, as Patterson adds, kill themselves. New findings shared exclusively with the Observer by legal support service the Medical Protection Society (MPS) confirm the deep discontent in Britain\u2019s medical profession. It has found that 52% of doctors working in the UK are dissatisfied with their work-life balance, 46% feel guilty about taking time off, and almost 40% believe their employer does not give them the support they need to do their job well. \u201cThese are sobering findings,\u201d said the society\u2019s president, Professor Dame Jane Dacre, who until 2018 was president of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP), which represents many hospital doctors in England. \u201cThey tell us that the human impact of all these things \u2013 rota gaps, austerity, low morale, working in hospitals with paint peeling off the walls and equipment that doesn\u2019t work, and not feeling that you can do your best for patients \u2013 is becoming disproportionate and is undermining doctors\u2019 sense of vocation.\u201d Perhaps the most telling statistic to emerge from an MPS survey of 275 UK doctors is that more than a third have considered moving abroad to safeguard their personal wellbeing. In addition, 68% said time for rest and recovery during often long shifts was not the norm, while 57% felt unable to take even a short break in between two clinically demanding procedures. While the sample was small, its conclusions tally with the growing evidence that more and more doctors feel unable to cope with the demands placed on them. Dacre visited 80% of England\u2019s hospitals during her time at the RCP. \u201cAt each hospital,\u201d she recalled, \u201cwe held open forums for doctors to come and talk about things that were on their minds. But very often open forums became like open season. The picture that emerged was of an unhappy and frustrated medical workforce. \u201cIt was heartbreaking to see these articulate, intelligent, empathic and skilled people feeling undervalued, under-resourced, demotivated, crushed and wanting to leave \u2013 despite medicine being the thing they loved doing. Burnout was endemic.\u201d Doctors are trained to get diagnoses and treatment right \u2013 because lives depend on it. They face many frustrations: long hours of unpaid overtime, often antisocial working hours, and an inability to rest, eat or drink easily on a night shift, as well as bullying and pressure from managers to see more patients. But what is worse for them, says Dacre, is a feeling that they can\u2019t be proud of the standard of care they are providing because there are too few staff, too many demands and too little time. Details of the government\u2019s NHS People Plan for England are due in the next few weeks. But with staff shortages now so routine, easing doctors\u2019 burden may not be simple. \u201cThese are people that deal with death, emergency situations, other people\u2019s misfortunes on a daily basis,\u201d said Dacre. \u201cThey save lives. Somebody needs to start thinking about saving them.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 30 September 2019 to clarify that the online forum The Political Mess is run by EveryDoctor, not the Doctors\u2019 Association UK.",

These ideas \u2013 \u201cstage sculptures\u201d, she calls them \u2013 might take the form of the ingenious revolving glass box that encloses the performers in director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sam-mendes\">Sam Mendes</a>\u2019s production of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/13/the-lehman-trilogy-review-lyttelton-sam-mendes\">The Lehman Trilogy</a>, transferring to Broadway next year after a sold-out run in London\u2019s West End, or an outsize replica of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/miley-cyrus\">Miley Cyrus</a>\u2019s tongue that the singer slid down on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/may/07/miley-cyrus-bangerz-review-o2-arena\">her 2014 Bangerz tour</a>. Or it could be 200,000 pieces of mirror fixed by hand on to columns for a Louis Vuitton runway show or a pair of hands 25m high emerging from Lake Constance in Austria, <a href=\"https://bregenzerfestspiele.com/en/programme/carmen-0\">tossing playing cards in the air</a> for a production of Bizet\u2019s Carmen.</p> \n<p>So, yes, ideas, ridiculous ones, lots of them. At first, Devlin tried to answer these inquiries honestly. Most of her ideas, she would reply, come just after she has woken up. She loves that moment when she\u2019s lying in bed, in a totally dark room, maybe jetlagged, and the only light is the faint edge round the curtains. There\u2019s something very stage-like about it. She sets an initial alarm \u2013 \u201ca very gentle one\u201d \u2013 then a proper one, to allow for 20 minutes of meditative dozing. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely liminal space,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can really luxuriate in what your mind would be like if you didn\u2019t have to do anything. It\u2019s really important.\u201d</p> \n<p>The problem is that people really hate this answer. \u201cThey almost want the, you know, map coordinates,\u201d she goes on, laughing. \u201c\u2018Where are the ideas? Come on! Don\u2019t fob me off with some bullshit about sleeping.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ced7b22503d9baf1977572818f5b734bfaffa344\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ced7b22503d9baf1977572818f5b734bfaffa344/243_455_6576_3948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Devlin inside the stage set she designed for The Hunt, Rupert Goold\u2019s adaptation of Thomas Vinterberg\u2019s film.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Devlin inside the stage set she designed for The Hunt, Rupert Goold\u2019s adaptation of Thomas Vinterberg\u2019s film.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Devlin being Devlin, she has come up with another, more evocative answer. \u201cI picked a space, which is a corridor,\u201d she explains, as we sit in the garden of her house in Dulwich, south London. Devlin recalls that she spent a lot of her childhood in corridors. First of all, she has \u201ca really big mouth\u201d, which meant she was always being kicked out of class. Second, she\u2019s very smiley, and this infuriated her teachers even more: \u201cThey\u2019d go, \u2018Esmerelda, wipe that grin off your face!\u2019\u201d Now, looking back, Devlin realises that corridors can be magical places. She might hear snatches of a physics class in one room, some poetry from another, a music lesson taking place down the hall, teachers having a gossip. \u201cBut I\u2019m the only person who\u2019s listening to all of that together,\u201d she exclaims. Then she stops: \u201cThe next thing is just not forgetting it.\u201d</p> \n<p>People tend to find this response a bit more satisfying.</p> \n<p>Over 25 years, Devlin has established herself as the world\u2019s most influential set designer. She began in theatre \u2013 via a degree in English literature from Bristol University and a foundation course at Central Saint Martins \u2013 and it\u2019s here that her impact has been especially profound. When she started out, theatre felt like a dying art form: predictable, staid, classic texts played for audiences in their dotage. Today it feels vibrant: a place where you switch off your phone (a radical idea), sit with other people (even more challenging) and experience entertainment that, when it\u2019s finished, will exist only in the memories of the people who were there. Some of Devlin\u2019s most notable stage sets include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/30/hamlet-review-benedict-cumberbatch-the-sanest-of-danes-observer\">Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s Hamlet at the Barbican in 2015</a>, a witty, clinical take on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/13/american-psycho-musical-review\">American Psycho at the Almeida</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.haroldpinter.org/plays/plays_betrayal6.shtml\">National Theatre\u2019s 1998 revival of Harold Pinter\u2019s Betrayal</a>. (On opening night, Pinter was doing a meet-and-greet and said, \u201cHave you met Es Devlin? She wrote the play.\u201d)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03796cd320a23e486e4341016d02b7a9aca9ba49\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03796cd320a23e486e4341016d02b7a9aca9ba49/0_194_4217_2531/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Devlin\u2019s lake stage for Bizet\u2019s Carmen at Bregenz festival in Austria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Devlin\u2019s lake stage for Bizet\u2019s Carmen at Bregenz festival in Austria.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 172028009672/courtesy of Es Devlin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Devlin \u2013 who is petite but strong-looking and today, as she often is, dressed head-to-toe in black, an exact match for her hair, which is knotted in a bun \u2013 thinks her job as a set designer in the theatre is to find \u201clittle chinks in the armour of the brain\u201d. When she gets it right, complex ideas and even archaic language suddenly make perfect sense to an audience. \u201cYou get these tiny opportunities where people relax enough to feel that everything is familiar and they can follow the story,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all know that feeling when we go to the theatre and we\u2019re either relaxed knowing we\u2019re in good hands, or anxious because we\u2019re in crap hands and it\u2019s going to be a shit night.\u201d</p> \n<p>Devlin\u2019s theatre work led organically to designing sets for music shows. A turning point, she acknowledges, was when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">Kanye West</a> saw images of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/apr/28/artsfeatures.popandrock2\">the stage set she created with the Chapman b</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/apr/28/artsfeatures.popandrock2\">rothers</a> for the British post-punk band Wire in 2003. This led to Devlin and West working together from 2005 for almost a decade, including on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/11/jay-z-kanye-west-review\">2011 Watch the Throne tour</a>, where West and Jay-Z stood on giant LED cubes on to which images and lights were projected. She created the set for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele\">Adele</a>\u2019s first concerts for five years in 2016, spent two years on <a href=\"https://esdevlin.com/work/u2-innocence-experience\">U2\u2019s Innocence &amp; Experience arena show</a> and somehow managed to bring an 80ft animatronic human figure to life for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/take-that\">Take That</a>.</p> \n<p>All of these set designs are technically dazzling, but Devlin is adamant that her work should never overshadow the performers. She also hopes there\u2019s a coherence in thought and process in everything she does. \u201cMoving between genres,\u201d she says, \u201cyou can see there\u2019s a spinning cube that might happen at the Serpentine Gallery, it might happen at the National Theatre and it might happen on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> stage. People never really, not recently anyway, come along and say, \u2018I want one of these.\u2019 It\u2019s more, \u2018Here\u2019s the music, this is the day of the show, let\u2019s begin.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11f0b0dadc74147b5a281efd66213df294bc38f9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11f0b0dadc74147b5a281efd66213df294bc38f9/0_0_3888_2167/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miley Cyrus emerges from her own mouth, as designed by Devlin, on her 2014 tour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"557\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miley Cyrus emerges from her own mouth, as designed by Devlin, on her 2014 tour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Es Devlin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In recent times, though, a significant change has taken place for Devlin. For most of her career, her job has mainly been to bring someone else\u2019s vision to life. But now she\u2019s coming in earlier in the process and as an artist herself. Mendes is collaborating with her on a play that hasn\u2019t even been written yet: the visuals are just as important as the words, if not more so. Likewise, Abel Tesfaye, the Canadian R&amp;B artist known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-weeknd\">the Weeknd</a>, has brought in Devlin long before his fourth album is completed to establish how the stage set for his tour will look. Devlin\u2019s also been asked by <a href=\"https://www.pitzhanger.org.uk/about/\">Pitzhanger</a>, a country home in west London owned by the architect Sir John Soane in the early 1800s and reopened this year as a gallery, to make a sculpture there. Hers will be the second show, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/kapoor\">Anish Kapoor</a>\u2019s.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been the secret plan all along,\u201d Devlin whispers theatrically, about these new projects that place her firmly at centre stage. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t a plan. You just grow. What I\u2019ve noticed is that you get to a point in your practice and you radiate that, and then people pick up on it.\u201d</p> \n<p>We meet in the afternoon, at 4pm, and Devlin\u2019s already been to Paris, had a meeting with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/nicolas-ghesquiere\">Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re</a>, creative director at Louis Vuitton, and come back. Now, she talks for more than two hours without remotely flagging. There\u2019s a story that, while she was in labour with her second child, she was simultaneously sending plans to the singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shakira\">Shakira</a> \u2013 I ask her if I\u2019ve heard it right, though I suspect I know the answer.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s sadly true,\u201d she replies. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/jul/14/felix-barrett-punchdrunk-theatre-stage\">Felix Barrett</a> [founder of the theatre company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/punchdrunk\">Punchdrunk</a>] was working on that with me.

The family bought their house in 2016 and Devlin says she is especially besotted with the garden: it has a woodland feel with plants flowering over the spring and summer like \u201ca slow-motion fireworks display\u201d. The only indication that we\u2019re not deep in the country are the gentle pock-pock of tennis balls from the club next door and a beep-beep-beep of train doors opening at a nearby station. Devlin says that when a new project comes in, she decides to take it based on whether it excites her enough to leave her children and her garden behind.</p> \n<p>Devlin\u2019s design studio is based on the ground floor of her house in two soundproofed rooms. She usually has between eight and 10 employees, mainly women, including teachers from the <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/\">Bartlett School of Architecture</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.rca.ac.uk/\">Royal College of Art</a>, dotted between props and prototypes from previous projects. The studio is currently home to around 15 projects at different stages of development. Top of the list when we meet in July is the Pitzhanger commission, which has just opened. \u201cThey said to me, \u2018Do whatever you want,\u2019\u201d she recalls. This, it turns out, is a dangerous thing to say to Devlin. She came back and said that she wanted to fill the gallery with a sprawling map. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a map of the world in any recognisable way,\u201d she clarifies. \u201cIt\u2019s a map that charts, in my subjective opinion, each moment of major perspective shift in the course of our species.\u201d She roars at the ridiculousness of what she\u2019s saying. \u201cSo a minor ambition then.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some background might be helpful here. When she was six, Devlin\u2019s parents moved the family from Surbiton in west London to Rye on the south coast. \u201cThey went for a romantic weekend on the advice of my Auntie Pru and they bought a house, which was a really dumb thing to do because they hadn\u2019t sold their other house,\u201d Devlin says. \u201cBut anyway.\u201d One of the landmarks of the town was a handmade, 1:100 scale model of Rye in Victorian times, complete with sound and light effects. <a href=\"https://www.ryeheritage.co.uk/\">The Story of Rye</a> was made by a local couple \u2013 a retired teacher and an electrical engineer \u2013 and had a voiceover, Devlin recalls, recounting pertinent historical facts in \u201cthis terribly cheesy actor-y voice\u201d.</p> \n<p>If only by repeated exposure, Devlin became mildly obsessed with this model. So when Pitzhanger called, she wondered if she might do her take on it. Again, Devlin being Devlin, the stakes have been raised exponentially. Her tour of the major \u201cperspective shifts\u201d in history will start at the beginning of time and go through to today, finishing on the shores of Bangladesh with the tides rising. Along the way, there will be nods to cave paintings, the period of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Confucius\">Confucius</a>, the pyramids, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/nov/05/spaceexploration.internationalnews\">Nicolaus Copernicus\u2019s Frombork tower</a>, the Enlightenment, the trenches of the second world war, the street where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2015/dec/01/rosa-parks-60th-anniversary-bus-seat-civil-rights-pictures\">Rosa Parks</a> took her seat on a bus, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Cape-Canaveral\">Cape Canaveral</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/cern\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/cern\">ern</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39a8539c89de1b6b1810e6e151702718fe69bd34\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39a8539c89de1b6b1810e6e151702718fe69bd34/0_0_1976_1573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An artist\u2019s impression of the \u2018Poem Pavilion\u2019 that Devlin will create for next year\u2019s Dubai Expo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"796\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An artist\u2019s impression of the \u2018Poem Pavilion\u2019 that Devlin will create for next year\u2019s Dubai Expo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Es Devlin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The work \u2013 which is not remotely complete when we meet \u2013 is, Devlin accepts, hard to explain. \u201cI have demonstrated it with a quarter of a lemon and two mirrors, that might be the easiest way,\u201d she muses. \u201cThe room is rectangular, so you are in this squashed elliptical.

But it will also be an intriguing, unsettling experience to just stand in. \u201cThe curator, John Leslie, said, \u2018Es, you do a lot of telling the story.

      "bodyText": "Es Devlin, the 48-year-old British set designer, is often asked where her ideas come from. These ideas \u2013 \u201cstage sculptures\u201d, she calls them \u2013 might take the form of the ingenious revolving glass box that encloses the performers in director Sam Mendes\u2019s production of The Lehman Trilogy, transferring to Broadway next year after a sold-out run in London\u2019s West End, or an outsize replica of Miley Cyrus\u2019s tongue that the singer slid down on her 2014 Bangerz tour. Or it could be 200,000 pieces of mirror fixed by hand on to columns for a Louis Vuitton runway show or a pair of hands 25m high emerging from Lake Constance in Austria, tossing playing cards in the air for a production of Bizet\u2019s Carmen. So, yes, ideas, ridiculous ones, lots of them. At first, Devlin tried to answer these inquiries honestly. Most of her ideas, she would reply, come just after she has woken up. She loves that moment when she\u2019s lying in bed, in a totally dark room, maybe jetlagged, and the only light is the faint edge round the curtains. There\u2019s something very stage-like about it. She sets an initial alarm \u2013 \u201ca very gentle one\u201d \u2013 then a proper one, to allow for 20 minutes of meditative dozing. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely liminal space,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can really luxuriate in what your mind would be like if you didn\u2019t have to do anything. It\u2019s really important.\u201d The problem is that people really hate this answer. \u201cThey almost want the, you know, map coordinates,\u201d she goes on, laughing. \u201c\u2018Where are the ideas? Come on! Don\u2019t fob me off with some bullshit about sleeping.\u2019\u201d Devlin being Devlin, she has come up with another, more evocative answer. \u201cI picked a space, which is a corridor,\u201d she explains, as we sit in the garden of her house in Dulwich, south London. Devlin recalls that she spent a lot of her childhood in corridors. First of all, she has \u201ca really big mouth\u201d, which meant she was always being kicked out of class. Second, she\u2019s very smiley, and this infuriated her teachers even more: \u201cThey\u2019d go, \u2018Esmerelda, wipe that grin off your face!\u2019\u201d Now, looking back, Devlin realises that corridors can be magical places. She might hear snatches of a physics class in one room, some poetry from another, a music lesson taking place down the hall, teachers having a gossip. \u201cBut I\u2019m the only person who\u2019s listening to all of that together,\u201d she exclaims. Then she stops: \u201cThe next thing is just not forgetting it.\u201d People tend to find this response a bit more satisfying. Over 25 years, Devlin has established herself as the world\u2019s most influential set designer. She began in theatre \u2013 via a degree in English literature from Bristol University and a foundation course at Central Saint Martins \u2013 and it\u2019s here that her impact has been especially profound. When she started out, theatre felt like a dying art form: predictable, staid, classic texts played for audiences in their dotage. Today it feels vibrant: a place where you switch off your phone (a radical idea), sit with other people (even more challenging) and experience entertainment that, when it\u2019s finished, will exist only in the memories of the people who were there. Some of Devlin\u2019s most notable stage sets include Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s Hamlet at the Barbican in 2015, a witty, clinical take on American Psycho at the Almeida and the National Theatre\u2019s 1998 revival of Harold Pinter\u2019s Betrayal. (On opening night, Pinter was doing a meet-and-greet and said, \u201cHave you met Es Devlin? She wrote the play.\u201d) Devlin \u2013 who is petite but strong-looking and today, as she often is, dressed head-to-toe in black, an exact match for her hair, which is knotted in a bun \u2013 thinks her job as a set designer in the theatre is to find \u201clittle chinks in the armour of the brain\u201d. When she gets it right, complex ideas and even archaic language suddenly make perfect sense to an audience. \u201cYou get these tiny opportunities where people relax enough to feel that everything is familiar and they can follow the story,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all know that feeling when we go to the theatre and we\u2019re either relaxed knowing we\u2019re in good hands, or anxious because we\u2019re in crap hands and it\u2019s going to be a shit night.\u201d Devlin\u2019s theatre work led organically to designing sets for music shows. A turning point, she acknowledges, was when Kanye West saw images of the stage set she created with the Chapman brothers for the British post-punk band Wire in 2003. This led to Devlin and West working together from 2005 for almost a decade, including on his 2011 Watch the Throne tour, where West and Jay-Z stood on giant LED cubes on to which images and lights were projected. She created the set for Adele\u2019s first concerts for five years in 2016, spent two years on U2\u2019s Innocence &amp; Experience arena show and somehow managed to bring an 80ft animatronic human figure to life for Take That. All of these set designs are technically dazzling, but Devlin is adamant that her work should never overshadow the performers. She also hopes there\u2019s a coherence in thought and process in everything she does. \u201cMoving between genres,\u201d she says, \u201cyou can see there\u2019s a spinning cube that might happen at the Serpentine Gallery, it might happen at the National Theatre and it might happen on a Beyonc\u00e9 stage. People never really, not recently anyway, come along and say, \u2018I want one of these.\u2019 It\u2019s more, \u2018Here\u2019s the music, this is the day of the show, let\u2019s begin.\u2019\u201d In recent times, though, a significant change has taken place for Devlin. For most of her career, her job has mainly been to bring someone else\u2019s vision to life. But now she\u2019s coming in earlier in the process and as an artist herself. Mendes is collaborating with her on a play that hasn\u2019t even been written yet: the visuals are just as important as the words, if not more so. Likewise, Abel Tesfaye, the Canadian R&amp;B artist known as the Weeknd, has brought in Devlin long before his fourth album is completed to establish how the stage set for his tour will look. Devlin\u2019s also been asked by Pitzhanger, a country home in west London owned by the architect Sir John Soane in the early 1800s and reopened this year as a gallery, to make a sculpture there. Hers will be the second show, following Anish Kapoor\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s been the secret plan all along,\u201d Devlin whispers theatrically, about these new projects that place her firmly at centre stage. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t a plan. You just grow. What I\u2019ve noticed is that you get to a point in your practice and you radiate that, and then people pick up on it.\u201d We meet in the afternoon, at 4pm, and Devlin\u2019s already been to Paris, had a meeting with Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, creative director at Louis Vuitton, and come back. Now, she talks for more than two hours without remotely flagging. There\u2019s a story that, while she was in labour with her second child, she was simultaneously sending plans to the singer Shakira \u2013 I ask her if I\u2019ve heard it right, though I suspect I know the answer. \u201cThat\u2019s sadly true,\u201d she replies. \u201cFelix Barrett [founder of the theatre company Punchdrunk] was working on that with me. And, yeah, he came down to King\u2019s hospital to chat about Shakira in between contractions.\u201d Devlin insists she has slowed down now: partly because of her children (she has two, a daughter Ry and son Ludo, with her husband Jack Galloway, a costume designer), and partly because of where we\u2019re sitting. The family bought their house in 2016 and Devlin says she is especially besotted with the garden: it has a woodland feel with plants flowering over the spring and summer like \u201ca slow-motion fireworks display\u201d. The only indication that we\u2019re not deep in the country are the gentle pock-pock of tennis balls from the club next door and a beep-beep-beep of train doors opening at a nearby station.

Along the way, there will be nods to cave paintings, the period of Confucius, the pyramids, Nicolaus Copernicus\u2019s Frombork tower, the Enlightenment, the trenches of the second world war, the street where Rosa Parks took her seat on a bus, Cape Canaveral and Cern.

Here is a hybrid terrain of nature and technology: bare hills, flocks of wind turbines in the distance, the coming and going of light aircraft.

      "bodyText": "\u201cA sign of a bad building,\u201d says Richard Murphy, citing the 20th-century Dutch architect Aldo van Eyck, \u201cis that it only gets bigger when you get close to it.\u201d Whatever thought might have gone into its overall form, that is to say, there is none in the details or in the smaller registers of scale. Architecture is \u201cabout how one thing sits on another\u201d \u2013 a window on a sill or a handle on a door as much as a house on a landscape. It is a view that Murphy puts enthusiastically into practice in his own work, such as his own detail-rich Edinburgh home, named RIBA house of the year in 2016. He loves to pile it on \u2013 he leaves no joint unconsidered, no corner unarticulated, no jamb unthought. There\u2019s something Scottish (and never mind that Murphy comes originally from what is now Greater Manchester) about this liking for architecture as a thing highly wrought, for making a building into an essay or poem on building, for laying on the artistry thick. You can see it in Gillespie, Kidd and Coia\u2019s distressed seminary in Cardross, in the Scottish parliament building, in the works of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. On the exposed margin of Strathaven airfield, South Lanarkshire \u2013 at 846 feet above sea level the highest in Scotland \u2013 this love of craft encounters another constructional and physical reality. Here is a hybrid terrain of nature and technology: bare hills, flocks of wind turbines in the distance, the coming and going of light aircraft. Such structures as there are \u2013 hangars, the mast for a wind sock \u2013 are matter-of-fact and sturdy. Here, Murphy has designed a house for Marta Briongos and Colin MacKinnon, a trapeze performer and an ex-journalist who own and run the airfield. It is, at their request, steel-framed and clad in corrugated sheet, a long barn-like object running parallel to the landing strip.

The first play takes place on a mantelpiece, while the second is set on a cloud. Elusive on the page, they are wonderfully realised by director James Macdonald. Miriam Buether\u2019s decisive design sets up these stories about the lies we tell ourselves and each other in a frame of make-believe: a bulb-studded proscenium arch and traditional velvet curtains. Christopher Shutt\u2019s sound design murmurs through the action like a sceptical wind. A juggler and a gymnast appear between scenes, twirling, inverting, stretching the bounds of probability: they are not in the playscript, so is this a Macdonald intervention or a late thought by Churchill? They make us ask again what we should believe in \u2013 our eyes? All is disconcerting, much is very funny. Churchill\u2019s elastic way with structure and the gauntlet of her ideas are so striking that there is a risk of overlooking just how comic a writer she is, and how powerful a creator of weird and credible dialogue.</p> <p><em>Glass</em> takes its title from a character who can \u2013 we are told \u2013 be seen through and is chronically fragile. A girl. Shutt sends chimes through the action as if the stage were a chandelier. Also sitting on Buether\u2019s precarious strip of a shelf, suspended in darkness, is one chap who declares himself a clock, and another who says he is a vase. They all look like people to us \u2013 but then who knows? In <em>Kill</em>, a languid Greek god encapsulates all the deities; he looks down, smoking, on a child who, scribbling furiously, represents all humans. As he recites a tangle of myths, he reminds us that he doesn\u2019t exist. <em>Bluebeard\u2019s Friends</em> (its full title) is excoriating satire, a look at the woman-murderer as if he were a contemporary monster \u2013 \u201chorrified to learn my friend Bluebeard is a serial killer\u201d \u2013 who will rapidly provide a commercial opportunity: at the back of the stage, the blood-spattered gowns of his victims dangle, waiting to be marketed by his chums.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd855181d635d94cc0367bc43d3736edb637ee57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd855181d635d94cc0367bc43d3736edb637ee57/0_199_5774_3464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Louisa Harland, Kwabena Ansah, Rebekah Murrell and Patrick McNamee in Glass.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louisa Harland, Kwabena Ansah, Rebekah Murrell and Patrick McNamee in Glass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is not a dud performance in any of these plays: on the contrary. But it is in the longest drama, <em>Imp </em>\u2013 naturalistic, with brown sofas and sad family histories \u2013 that the cast pull together most strongly. Deborah Findlay and Toby Jones are elderly cousins \u2013 \u201cthere\u2019s kissing cousins but no kissing here\u201d \u2013 who share a house together, with some memories of violence and a small, intimate secret that subtly recalls Pandora\u2019s box. They are visited by a young niece and a homeless man who becomes her lover. The direction of the plot \u2013 delivered in short scenes under a drab domestic light \u2013 is never guessable: sometimes, as is pointed out in <em>Kill</em>, unleashed furies can be quietened, and sometimes not. Louisa Harland and Tom Mothersdale are riveting as the on-off lovers: one of them open, the other opaque; both equally subtle. Toby Jones is effortlessly convincing as he manoeuvres from grumpiness to resignation. And how wonderful to see Deborah Findlay unleashing her strengths both as a comic actress and as a rage-fuelled missile. She has the part with the greatest range and she uses it to the full: towering in anger, and beautifully baleful in her sagging shoes: \u201cI remember sex. Dimly\u2026 You look at it now and you think\u2026 Whatever was that?\u201d</p> <p>Each of these plays could have a future independent of the others. Yet they gain from being seen together. Echoes gradually become apparent: dark moments in Shakespeare plays thread their way throughout alongside Greek goriness. There is a beautiful arc to the evening as the final line quietly touches on opening moments. It is a testament to these oblique, remarkable plays that a single word can provoke a murmur of recognition.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.curveonline.co.uk/whats-on/shows/my-beautiful-laundrette/\" title=\"\">My Beautiful Laundrette</a></strong> has always been loved. The 1985 film \u2013 written by Hanif Kureishi and directed by Stephen Frears \u2013 was a sudsy revolution, an acerbic look at Thatcherite Britain which was also a romance. Kureishi\u2019s new version comes up sharply, with a welcome emphasis on the predicament of women: Cathy Tyson struts with fine scorn. The factionalism and racism are all too recognisable: Paddy Daly\u2019s strongly played punk Genghis \u2013 all brawn and fury and no vocabulary \u2013 could be a voice from today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b7866449aac065bae60085c5ae45ddb0579be46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b7866449aac065bae60085c5ae45ddb0579be46/0_0_2480_1654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonny Fines as Johnny and Omar Malik as Omar in My Beautiful Laundrette at the Curve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonny Fines as Johnny and Omar Malik as Omar in My Beautiful Laundrette at the Curve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ellie Kurttz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The love affair between Omar \u2013 the son of a Pakistani intellectual in a family of businessmen, played by Omar Malik \u2013 and Johnny, a white punk, who once took part in attacks on his lover\u2019s family, is the action\u2019s unexpected, hopeful centre. But there is another romantic transformation, seen in Grace Smart\u2019s busily moving design when a row of greasy washing machines becomes saffron yellow. The two young men \u2013 \u201cI love cleaning!\u201d \u2013 aim at a south London version of Scott Fitzgerald: to make a \u201claundrette as big as the Ritz\u201d. It\u2019s a brilliant wheeze. Their vision bursts gorgeously into life when they switch on their neon sign of a tilted detergent packet \u2013 and again when, as they splash each other with water, the stage is entirely covered in a mass of tiny bubbles.</p> <p>I would like still more: Nikolai Foster\u2019s production was, at preview, flickering rather than flaming. Gordon Warnecke, who played Omar in the film (he and Daniel Day-Lewis did so much kissing they were called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/01/how-we-made-my-beautiful-laundrette-stephen-frears-gordon-warnecke-hanif-kureishi-daniel-day-lewis\" title=\"\">Listerine </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/01/how-we-made-my-beautiful-laundrette-stephen-frears-gordon-warnecke-hanif-kureishi-daniel-day-lewis\" title=\"\">Kids</a>), appears more stiffly as his father. But how lovely to have a strong script and visuals playing against each other; \u201cWhere are those two buggers?\u201d asks an unknowing uncle as the two boys make love in the next room.

Glass takes its title from a character who can \u2013 we are told \u2013 be seen through and is chronically fragile. A girl. Shutt sends chimes through the action as if the stage were a chandelier. Also sitting on Buether\u2019s precarious strip of a shelf, suspended in darkness, is one chap who declares himself a clock, and another who says he is a vase. They all look like people to us \u2013 but then who knows? In Kill, a languid Greek god encapsulates all the deities; he looks down, smoking, on a child who, scribbling furiously, represents all humans. As he recites a tangle of myths, he reminds us that he doesn\u2019t exist. Bluebeard\u2019s Friends (its full title) is excoriating satire, a look at the woman-murderer as if he were a contemporary monster \u2013 \u201chorrified to learn my friend Bluebeard is a serial killer\u201d \u2013 who will rapidly provide a commercial opportunity: at the back of the stage, the blood-spattered gowns of his victims dangle, waiting to be marketed by his chums. There is not a dud performance in any of these plays: on the contrary. But it is in the longest drama, Imp \u2013 naturalistic, with brown sofas and sad family histories \u2013 that the cast pull together most strongly. Deborah Findlay and Toby Jones are elderly cousins \u2013 \u201cthere\u2019s kissing cousins but no kissing here\u201d \u2013 who share a house together, with some memories of violence and a small, intimate secret that subtly recalls Pandora\u2019s box. They are visited by a young niece and a homeless man who becomes her lover. The direction of the plot \u2013 delivered in short scenes under a drab domestic light \u2013 is never guessable: sometimes, as is pointed out in Kill, unleashed furies can be quietened, and sometimes not. Louisa Harland and Tom Mothersdale are riveting as the on-off lovers: one of them open, the other opaque; both equally subtle. Toby Jones is effortlessly convincing as he manoeuvres from grumpiness to resignation. And how wonderful to see Deborah Findlay unleashing her strengths both as a comic actress and as a rage-fuelled missile. She has the part with the greatest range and she uses it to the full: towering in anger, and beautifully baleful in her sagging shoes: \u201cI remember sex. Dimly\u2026 You look at it now and you think\u2026 Whatever was that?\u201d Each of these plays could have a future independent of the others. Yet they gain from being seen together. Echoes gradually become apparent: dark moments in Shakespeare plays thread their way throughout alongside Greek goriness. There is a beautiful arc to the evening as the final line quietly touches on opening moments. It is a testament to these oblique, remarkable plays that a single word can provoke a murmur of recognition. My Beautiful Laundrette has always been loved. The 1985 film \u2013 written by Hanif Kureishi and directed by Stephen Frears \u2013 was a sudsy revolution, an acerbic look at Thatcherite Britain which was also a romance. Kureishi\u2019s new version comes up sharply, with a welcome emphasis on the predicament of women: Cathy Tyson struts with fine scorn. The factionalism and racism are all too recognisable: Paddy Daly\u2019s strongly played punk Genghis \u2013 all brawn and fury and no vocabulary \u2013 could be a voice from today. The love affair between Omar \u2013 the son of a Pakistani intellectual in a family of businessmen, played by Omar Malik \u2013 and Johnny, a white punk, who once took part in attacks on his lover\u2019s family, is the action\u2019s unexpected, hopeful centre. But there is another romantic transformation, seen in Grace Smart\u2019s busily moving design when a row of greasy washing machines becomes saffron yellow. The two young men \u2013 \u201cI love cleaning!\u201d \u2013 aim at a south London version of Scott Fitzgerald: to make a \u201claundrette as big as the Ritz\u201d. It\u2019s a brilliant wheeze. Their vision bursts gorgeously into life when they switch on their neon sign of a tilted detergent packet \u2013 and again when, as they splash each other with water, the stage is entirely covered in a mass of tiny bubbles. I would like still more: Nikolai Foster\u2019s production was, at preview, flickering rather than flaming. Gordon Warnecke, who played Omar in the film (he and Daniel Day-Lewis did so much kissing they were called the Listerine Kids), appears more stiffly as his father. But how lovely to have a strong script and visuals playing against each other; \u201cWhere are those two buggers?\u201d asks an unknowing uncle as the two boys make love in the next room. And Jonny Fines (another namesake casting) galvanises: witty, gentle and loping \u2013 with Malcolm McDowell Catherine wheel eyes. Star ratings (out of five) Glass. Kill. Bluebeard. Imp. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 My Beautiful Laundrette \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Glass. Kill. Bluebeard.

The referendum in Scotland in 2014 featured cybernats hurling the word quisling and other vituperative insults at Scots who opposed independence. The Liberal Democrats, who like to think of themselves as the saintly ones, are not above reproach.

Incendiary phrase-making helped make Mr Johnson\u2019s journalistic fame, powered the Leave campaign to victory in the referendum and eased his path to the premiership. Having been so far thwarted in his desire to trigger an election, there is, I suspect, an element of deliberately goading the opposition parties to bring on a no-confidence motion. Most importantly, Dominic Cummings, his chief strategist, is telling him that they will profit from deepening Britain\u2019s division into two snarling camps. He sees a path to an election victory by sharpening the polarisation of the country on Leave/Remain lines and rousing a furious Brexit tribe behind them while the anti-Brexit forces are split.

The trouble is that we are in a super-heated context. \u201cSurrender\u201d is an incendiary phrase because it comes from the family of toxic branding that includes describing judges as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d and parliamentarians as \u201csaboteurs\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d.

That daily or weekly alert to the goings-on in the courts and councils and schools and streets a walk or a bus ride from where we live is no longer an anticipated feature of a majority of lives. From <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/more-than-40-local-news-titles-closed-in-2018-with-loss-of-some-editorial-275-jobs-new-figures-show/\" title=\"\">2005 to the end of 2018, there was a net loss of 245 local news titles</a>. An estimated 58% of the country is now served by no regional newspaper. Last week, Mark Thompson, former director general of the BBC and current chief executive of the <em>New York Times,</em> suggested in a keynote lecture that the closures would only increase without a dramatic shift in policy and investment, and that \u201cA society which fails to provide its different communities and groups with the means to listen and come to understand each other\u2019s pasts and presents shouldn\u2019t be surprised if mutual incomprehension and division are the consequence. If you doubt that any of this connects to real-world politics and national wellbeing, you need to pay more attention.\u201d</p> <p>On a national level the relative decline in print journalism has been partly compensated by the shift online and a blizzard of information from other media; locally, that is not the case. Many of us are increasingly likely to hear more news of the Twitter-trending lives of Piers Morgan or Kim Kardashian than the people with whom we share our own town. The effect of that shift is arguably every bit as damaging to community as the decline in footfall on the high street. A local newspaper, at its best, reflects the place in which you live in all its minute complexity \u2013 its celebrations and its commiserations and its incarcerations; it not only holds powerful local figures to account, it shapes shared feelings of hope and of anger and helps to piece together the serial story of where you are.</p> <p>The editor of the long-defunct <em>Barrow Herald</em>, in Cumbria, expressed that relationship in these terms: \u201cNothing interests a man more than the news of his own neighbourhood. We continue our endeavours to cram our sheet full of facts \u2013 facts possessing as much local interest as possible. Our chief object is to make this paper a faithful record of everything of public importance that may transpire in Barrow.\u201d What happens when that object and faith is lost?</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/cmcp/local-news.pdf\" title=\"\">2016 study by King\u2019s College London</a>, found UK towns whose local newspapers had suffered closure showed a \u201cdemocracy deficit\u201d that resulted in measurably reduced community engagement by local people and a heightened distrust of public institutions. \u201cWe can all have our own social media account, but when local papers are depleted or in some cases simply don\u2019t exist, people lose a communal voice. They feel angry, not listened to and more likely to believe malicious rumour,\u201d Dr Martin Moore, the author of the study, observed. The absence was felt in the national conversation too. Good stories have usually filtered up the news chain from reporters on the ground. The King\u2019s study found that the third of parliamentary constituencies that were no longer covered by a dedicated daily local newspaper at the time of the 2015 general election received scant mention during it.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/779882/021919_DCMS_Cairncross_Review_.pdf\" title=\"\">Cairncross Review into the crisis</a> was published earlier this year. It drew a familiar portrait of the reasons for this decline. The business model of local news (and by extension local democracy) was entirely dependent on classified advertising. When estate agents, car dealers and other local retailers moved their investment in \u201ceyeballs\u201d on to search engines, money drained away. The collapse in finance led to cutbacks in newsrooms and papers became thinner and more distant from their audience, further reducing their appeal. In particular, Dame Frances Cairncross concluded, despite many honourable and heroic exceptions, that those elements that gave local news its storytelling bite and purpose became largely unaffordable: \u201cThe cost of investigative journalism is great and rarely seems to pay for itself\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Her recommendations to the government argued for a system of direct funding of public-interest news outlets and charitable status for some publishers. The review also recommended urgent investigation by the competition regulator into the dominance of the advertising market by Facebook and Google.</p> <p>Some small-scale efforts to fix local news have already been made along the lines that Cairncross suggested. The BBC \u2013 whose website is part of the competitive problem for commercial local news \u2013 created the Local Democracy Reporting Service to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/11/bbc-to-fund-150-local-news-journalists\" title=\"\">fund 150 journalists</a> to cover council meetings and local public services, and to share stories both with local news organisations and the corporation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/22/is-big-techs-move-to-fund-local-news-a-cynical-ploy\">Is big tech's move to fund local news a cynical ploy?  | Emily Bell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most of the other investment in news-resuscitation is promised, ironically, by Facebook and Google, who have each launched ambitious $100m-a-year schemes (covering Britain and the US) to find ways to rebuild the local news economies that between them they have effectively destroyed.

Last week it announced a multimillion dollar investment in Archant, \u201cthe News Corp of East Anglia\u201d, which owns a range of successful local titles from the <em>Hackney Gazette</em> to the <em>New European</em>. The money was to be devoted to testing models of local online news in three \u201cnews deserts\u201d that have lost coverage.</p> <p>While such experiments take place \u2013 and there is cause for optimism, too, in smaller co-operative and community models of news gathering \u2013 the critical business of investigating local stories for local people persists in many areas and thrives in a few. The best journalism always has a sense of vocation. We feature insights from some of those outstanding professionals who, despite everything, continue to operate in that spirit, who understand the importance of getting the story straight for the people it affects most directly.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/authors/amanda-cameron/\" title=\"\">Amanda Cameron, Bristol Post</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e14e9027199fc5f9b04342ce3e1a82b9122c23f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e14e9027199fc5f9b04342ce3e1a82b9122c23f8/0_295_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Journalist Amanda Cameron photographed at the Bristol Post offices in Temple Way, Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Journalist Amanda Cameron photographed at the Bristol Post offices in Temple Way, Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Late-career news journalist who exposed a mock slave auction in a local school</em></p> <p>Originally from New Zealand, former medical writer Amanda Cameron retrained as a journalist in her late 30s.

The headteacher tried to expel the pupils, but governors overruled him. \u201cThere was so much secrecy from the school when I was trying to find out what happened,\u201d Cameron says. \u201cIt felt very adversarial, and the community was very divided around what I was trying to do. Some people attacked me [verbally] for reporting it, wanting me to leave the school alone.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cThis was something that had to be challenged.

There was so much competition to get headlines.\u201d Working at the <em>Bath Chronicle </em>in the UK was very different, she says. \u201cYou instantly got out into the community, and started to meet its people, and understand its issues fully.\u201d She reported a successful four-year fight by the residents of a local estate, Foxhill, to <a href=\"https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/in-your-area/victory-foxhill-residents-after-judge-1695031\" title=\"\">save their homes from demolition </a>\u2013 which would have resulted in the loss of more than 200 social homes for rent \u2013 and she is passionate about local journalism\u2019s importance in the wider media landscape. \u201cLocally, you can follow up the impact of a story in a way that nationals haven\u2019t always got the time to commit to. Seeing what happens next is so important.\u201d</p> <p>Last October, Cameron started working as a local democracy reporter for the news publisher <a href=\"https://www.reachplc.com/our-people\" title=\"\">Reach</a> from the offices of the <em>Bristol Post</em>. The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/lnp/ldrs\" title=\"\">local democracy initiative</a> was launched by the BBC in 2017 and allocated 144 new reporters to news organisations across England, Scotland and Wales, to boost coverage of local authorities and other public sector meetings. It\u2019s been a breath of air, she says, to go into that detail; her recent stories include objections to the building of three new tower blocks on the site of a former fire station, and the <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/health/retired-doctor-says-patients-pain-3310384\" title=\"\">accusation by a former GP</a> that the local NHS is breaking national rules to deny people hip operations. \u201cThe reporting of the story is now the most important thing with my job, rather than finding an audience.

Why are places outside London not properly represented?\u201d</p> <p>One of the UK\u2019s most respected investigative journalists, Williams has undertaken some impressively dogged and far-reaching reporting. Take last year\u2019s series <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/hidden-homeless\" title=\"\">Hidden Homeless</a>. She\u2019d had \u201can inkling\u201d, she says, \u201cthat single men were being placed in derelict houses a few years ago. So I started to talk to people, and the story kept growing.\u201d She discovered that councils were placing placing families in flea-ridden, drug-infested guest houses, and went to see the mice, mould and rotting cupboards for herself. She found that people not in \u201cpriority need\u201d were being directed to unlivable dwellings by homeless associations and local housing providers, with their landlords collecting more than \u00a33,000 a month in housing benefit regardless. She also revealed how the deaths of homeless people were <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/the-deaths-they-dont-count-15021204\" title=\"\">not being properly recorded</a>, focusing on heartbreaking stories like that of <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/tragedy-of-man-killed-in-bin-horror-935755\" title=\"\">Stefan Tomkins</a>, who was crushed to death in the bin where he was sleeping.</p> <p>Williams\u2019s reporting had a significant impact: Manchester town hall announced an emergency review, mayor Andy Burnham promised to buy up slum properties, and the Office of National Statistics started recording the deaths of the homeless. It wasn\u2019t the first time her work had led to policy changes. In 2017, her <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/spice-nightmare-manchester-city-centre-12870520\" title=\"\">investigation into the use of the drug Spice</a> by care-leavers, prisoners and the homeless led to agencies recording incidents involving the drug for the first time, and won her specialist writer of the year at the Regional Press awards. Both investigations led to nominations for the Orwell prize.</p> <p>Was she proud when the authorities paid attention? \u201cYes. That\u2019s why I do what I do. I want my work to change things.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Ruthin, north Wales, Williams was fascinated by politics from a young age. She remembers hearing Geoffrey Howe\u2019s incendiary cabinet resignation speech in parliament in the car with her dad in 1990 (\u201che always had news on the radio\u201d) and the sleaze scandals of the John Major years. \u201cI found them so interesting and intriguing. I got so precocious about it, I was reading<em> Private Eye</em> when I was 12.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You shouldn\u2019t learn about journalism at a distance. It\u2019s really important to be around people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Becoming a music fan in her teens, she changed tack, wanting to be a music journalist, but after an English degree at Manchester University, returned to her earlier interests. She did an NCTJ qualification by distance learning \u201cbecause I couldn\u2019t afford to go anywhere, and couldn\u2019t drive\u201d. She learned a lot \u2013 \u201cparticularly that you shouldn\u2019t learn about journalism at a distance. It\u2019s really important when you\u2019re a local journalist to be around people.\u201d</p> <p>That is more necessary than ever in the age of the internet, she says. When she started at the <em>Stockport Express</em> in 2007, their newsroom had one person to put articles online. \u201cIt was a crazy time to start out, because it was clear that everything was undergoing this massive revolution, and happening very quickly, and no one really knew what to do.\u201d Nevertheless, she believes that journalism\u2019s role in society hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether someone reads a story through Facebook or in print. The most important question is the same to me: are you still serving the readers properly in your work? If you are, then they\u2019ll read it.</p> <p>Williams\u2019s job involves plenty of pedestrian tasks too, such as reporting \u201con things that happen there and then\u201d,going to council and combined authority meetings, and keeping on top of Freedom of Information Act requests and long-term projects. Recent work includes reports on <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/power-up-north-closing-north-16402098\" title=\"\">regional inequality in the UK</a> and the troubling inefficiencies of the <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/greater-manchester-polices-27m-new-16719028\" title=\"\">police\u2019s new computer system</a>.</p> <p>She sees the future of local journalism as bright. \u201cHolding power to account and keeping on top of that for your readers is so important \u2013 and there\u2019s an appetite to hear more than that now.\u201d <strong>JR</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://tombristow.journoportfolio.com/my-videos/\" title=\"\">Tom Bristow, Archant press, Norwich</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4df9b0020b93a66ee9a704de23559329120ef0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4df9b0020b93a66ee9a704de23559329120ef0f/0_292_5392_3235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Investigations editor Tom Bristow at the Archant head offices in Norwich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Investigations editor Tom Bristow at the Archant head offices in Norwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Norwich-based investigations editor for regional Archant titles including Eastern Daily Press. Shortlisted for an Amnesty media award in 2011 and highly commended at last year\u2019s British journalism awards</em></p> <p>In July 2017, the Norwich-based newspaper <em>Eastern Daily Press </em>published a short news piece about an investigation at the heart of the local constabulary. One year earlier, a Norfolk police doctor had been convicted after admitting to 13 indecent assaults against female officers. Questions were raised about an initial cover-up \u2013 the assaults dated as far back as 1993 \u2013 but, according to a Norfolk police statement, an investigation by Essex police had concluded with no charges or calls for further action.</p> <p>\u201cAfter we published,\u201d says Tom Bristow, 32, \u201cvictims of the doctor got in touch, very annoyed, saying: \u2018Hang on a sec, this isn\u2019t what happened.\u2019\u201d They said the paper needed to find the full Essex investigation report if they wanted tell the whole story. \u201cAnd that,\u201d he says, \u201cis where we came in.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s got to be something there to let people know what the council and the police are up to</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2016, Bristow, originally from London, was appointed to a newly formed investigations unit at Archant, which owns <em>Eastern Daily Press</em> and more than 50 other local newspapers around the country. \u201cWe were getting all these tips that we weren\u2019t pursuing because we were so focused on the day-to-day,\u201d he says. The idea was that, as editor of the three-person unit, serving local papers in Suffolk and London as well as Norfolk, Bristow would be able to step back and focus on knottier stories that required time and resources to unpick.</p> <p> Bristow had form in this area. On his first reporting job with the <em>Southport Visiter</em>, soon after graduating from Edinburgh university, he carried out an investigation into Lancashire gang masters, which got him shortlisted for the Amnesty media awards in 2011. \u201cThat really gave me confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my first job, on a tiny weekly paper, and I was being listed alongside the BBC. I thought, wow, this is worth doing.\u201deading up the investigations unit at Archant feels like \u201ca very unusual and luxury position\u201d, says Bristow. He has, for example, pursued tip-offs about rogue landlords around Norfolk, leading to several hard-hitting pieces about people in desperate rental situations; he also edited a Paul Foot award-winning series, written by <a href=\"https://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/star-reporter-emma-youle-wins-investigative-journalism-award-for-the-gazette-s-hidden-homeless-campaign-1-5074814\" title=\"\">Emma Youle for the</a><em><a href=\"https://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/star-reporter-emma-youle-wins-investigative-journalism-award-for-the-gazette-s-hidden-homeless-campaign-1-5074814\" title=\"\"> Hackney Gazette</a>,</em> about homelessness in London.</p> <p>For the Norfolk police story, Bristow and his reporter Dominic Gilbert spent weeks trying to get hold of the investigation report, while Gilbert went out and spoke to the victims. \u201cIt turns out Essex police did a really thorough job, reporting all kinds of failings, and none of that was mentioned in the Norfolk press release.\u201d</p> <p>Their efforts didn\u2019t go unrecognised: the resulting stories, published by the <em>Eastern Daily Press</em> in November and December 2017, were highly commended at last year\u2019s British journalism awards.</p> <p>Without well-resourced, regional journalism such as this, Bristow believes, \u201clocal power would not be held to account across the country. Because of the traditional strength of the local press in Britain no other institutions have developed to do this. There\u2019s got to be something there to let people know what the council and the police are up to, and to name and shame criminals as they go through the courts.\u201d The alternative, according to Bristow, is bleak. \u201cLocal democracy simply doesn\u2019t work if people aren\u2019t kept informed.\u201d <strong>Interview by Killian Fox</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/authors/aamir-mohammed/\" title=\"\">Aamir Mohammed, Wales Online</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"543bc01dc66066d117c99ed065f1f7e15aa057c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/543bc01dc66066d117c99ed065f1f7e15aa057c0/0_815_3744_2247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aamir Mohammed at the Wales online offices.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aamir Mohammed at the Wales online offices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Named young journalist of the year for hard-hitting multimedia stories about family abduction and online suicide</em></p> <p>The 2019 Society of Editors\u2019 young journalist of the year was only nine months into his job at Wales Online (the online home of Welsh daily the <em>Western Mail </em>and its sister title, <em>Wales on Sunday</em>) when he won the award \u2013 and he still hadn\u2019t finished his postponed M.A. dissertation. \u201c\u201cIt\u2019s probably not the right way round to do it,\u201d Aamir Mohammed says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s essential to build that one-to-one contact.

Now, with Yemen in the grip of civil war \u2013 and the UK government having no evacuation procedures for British citizens - a councillor tipped off Mohammed that Saleh\u2019s mother\u2019s was trying to get visas and emergency passports to help Safia and her young family come back.</p> <p>\u201cI knew for [the story] really to have an impact, I needed to get a real sense of what Safia\u2019s life was like,\u201d Mohammed says. \u201cI needed as much detail as possible about how she was surviving her situation, including getting video and pictures.\u201d He spent time with her family in Cardiff and interviewed Safia in Yemen over Whatsapp with a translator, and obtained photographs and videos from Safia. Published in late November 2018, the piece had an immediate effect: Safia got her documents, and was reunited with her mother in January. \u201cThat was a brilliant feeling,\u201d he says, \u201cto have made such a difference.\u201d</p> <p>Mohammed didn\u2019t think about becoming a journalist until he was 15, when a careers adviser pointed out his good grades in English. Mohammed\u2019s father ran a clothes shop, and read the <em>South Wales Echo</em> every day, so his son knew local journalism; on his English and media degree he became \u201creally obsessed\u201d with news blogging. Becoming one of only 20 students on Cardiff University\u2019s news journalism MA (700 applied in his year), Mohammed became known as \u201cthe patch king\u201d for getting lots of stories from his allocated area of Rhymney \u2013 a fact he reveals with a shy pride. \u201cGetting people to trust you and know you care about them is what makes a difference,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Online community groups are a huge help to his work, he says. A post he spotted in his first term of university about a spate of youth crime was his first experience of making local contacts \u2013 he messaged the woman who posted it, then met her in person. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to build that one-to-one contact,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce people saw my stories go live, and trusted me, I was inundated.\u201d</p> <p>Another story commended by the Society of Editors was a feature about the drug Spice in Butetown in Cardiff for which he interviewed users and spent time at the medical centres giving out methadone. And another (written after a local man broadcast his suicide on the internet) was a harrowing piece about online \u201csuicide rooms\u201d, for which Mohammed joined one such chatroom on the dark web. \u201cThose are important stories to be told, so you\u2019ve got to keep telling yourself: don\u2019t get caught up.

She trained with the <em>Big Issue </em>and worked for the <em>Sunday Herald</em> and the <em>Sunday Times</em> before going freelance. In April, for her reporting on homelessness and drug addiction in Scotland, Goodwin won the prestigious Nicola Barry award at the Scottish press awards.</p> <p>Two years ago, Goodwin joined Scotland-based investigative platform<a href=\"https://theferret.scot/\" title=\"\"> the Ferret</a>, which was set up by a group of journalists in 2015. \u201cThey were frustrated with the current news model that doesn\u2019t invest in in-depth reporting or investigations,\u201d she says, \u201cso they set up a co-op which is owned by its members, who are paying subscribers. We also have a couple of funders\u201d \u2013 including Luminate and the Seedbed Trust \u2013 \u201cbut it\u2019s really our members that are at the heart of the Ferret.\u201d Though not exclusively local in its reporting, the platform covers regional public-interest stories at a level of detail few local newspapers can match.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Bureau of Investigative Journalism is able to reach out and tap into the resources of journalists across the country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Periodically, the platform polls its members on subjects they would like to read more about and then covers them in detail over an extended period. One area that Goodwin has been covering is homelessness. Late last year, in partnership with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, she contributed to a series on <a href=\"https://theferret.scot/two-people-per-week-die-homeless/\" title=\"\">homeless deaths</a> around the UK, revealing that at least 94 men and women in Scotland had died while homeless over the previous 12 months.</p> <p>Goodwin\u2019s in-depth knowledge of Glasgow added an extra dimension to her reporting. \u201cA man died in the local night shelter here, and just weeks before, I had interviewed him for a separate piece about homelessness,\u201d she said, \u201cso I was able to go back and listen to that recording, which was quite harrowing, knowing what happened to him subsequently.\u201d</p> <p>As well as appearing on the Ferret, Goodwin\u2019s articles ran on the BIJ\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/local/local-stories\" title=\"\">Bureau Local website</a>, alongside related stories from across the country. \u201cThen<em> Channel 4 News</em> covered it and were able to show that [homeless people dying in high numbers] was a UK-wide issue. That\u2019s the strength of organisations like the Bureau,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s able to reach out and tap into the resources of journalists right across the country.\u201d</p> <p>For Goodwin, maintaining a close, two-way relationship with readers is crucial. \u201cAt the Ferret we try to make sure we\u2019re very much engaged with our members and we report the things that are important to them, as well as things we think are in the public interest,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s a way of getting back to building communities around the work that we do.\u201d <strong>KF</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/annette-belcher/\" title=\"\">Annette Belcher, Birmingham Live</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3729135e5ccba0e31948f1989f10d4038f84ee2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3729135e5ccba0e31948f1989f10d4038f84ee2e/0_295_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Annette Belcher at the Birmingham Live offices.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annette Belcher at the Birmingham Live offices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Birmingham-based content editor at the Local Democracy Reporting Service</em></p> <p>Belcher, 35, was born in the Black Country and studied journalism in Wolverhampton before getting her first job with the Trinity Mirror group (now known as Reach). Her career has involved several transitions. \u201cI started as a reporter on our weekly title and progressed on to a daily, the <em>Birmingham Mail</em>. Then it was the transition from print to online, becoming a multimedia journalist on [the <em>Mail\u2019</em>s sister website] Birmingham Live.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With online platforms we\u2019re able to get even more information out there, cover stories in greater depth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In her 12 years as a reporter based in Birmingham, she is most proud of the <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/birminghamlive-launches-brumfeeds-2019-after-16187249\" title=\"\">#BrumFeeds</a> campaign for the Trussell Trust, which operates food banks across Birmingham. \u201cWe\u2019d been writing a lot in Birmingham Live about how people are becoming more and more reliant on food banks, but we felt that there was more we could do. So our aim when we launched in April 2018 was to collect 100 tonnes of food [from readers and the general public], equivalent to 100,000 meals, but we managed to blitz that figure and more than double it by December,\u201d says Belcher. \u201cWe did two massive events in the city centre: one was the launch and the second one was called the Big Drop, where we managed to collect a tonne of food in one day.\u201d</p> <p>Now her role has changed again: in April, Belcher joined the Local Democracy Reporting Service, launched by the BBC in 2017 as a counterbalance to clickbait, funding regional journalists to report on council meetings, crime stories and other areas that might not otherwise be covered in depth by local newspapers in the digital era. Though Belcher works out of the Birmingham Live offices, her role as content editor involves liaising with news desks across the country to promote LDRS material and tailor it for individual news websites.</p> <p>\u201cLocal journalism is a changing landscape, and very different from the days of print,\u201d says Belcher. \u201cBut with online platforms we\u2019re able to get even more information out there, cover stories in greater depth and better serve our communities, which is what local journalism is all about.\u201d</p> <p>Thanks to campaigns such as #Brumfeeds, combined with an intimate understanding of local readerships, the appetite for local journalism remains strong, Belcher believes. \u201cPeople really feel that they have a voice,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen national titles have come and gone, we\u2019ll still have that place within local communities. We have longevity because we\u2019ve built up loyalty with them.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the sounds fast disappearing from British homes in the past 15 years has been that of a fat local newspaper falling on to a doormat. That daily or weekly alert to the goings-on in the courts and councils and schools and streets a walk or a bus ride from where we live is no longer an anticipated feature of a majority of lives. From 2005 to the end of 2018, there was a net loss of 245 local news titles. An estimated 58% of the country is now served by no regional newspaper. Last week, Mark Thompson, former director general of the BBC and current chief executive of the New York Times, suggested in a keynote lecture that the closures would only increase without a dramatic shift in policy and investment, and that \u201cA society which fails to provide its different communities and groups with the means to listen and come to understand each other\u2019s pasts and presents shouldn\u2019t be surprised if mutual incomprehension and division are the consequence. If you doubt that any of this connects to real-world politics and national wellbeing, you need to pay more attention.\u201d On a national level the relative decline in print journalism has been partly compensated by the shift online and a blizzard of information from other media; locally, that is not the case. Many of us are increasingly likely to hear more news of the Twitter-trending lives of Piers Morgan or Kim Kardashian than the people with whom we share our own town. The effect of that shift is arguably every bit as damaging to community as the decline in footfall on the high street. A local newspaper, at its best, reflects the place in which you live in all its minute complexity \u2013 its celebrations and its commiserations and its incarcerations; it not only holds powerful local figures to account, it shapes shared feelings of hope and of anger and helps to piece together the serial story of where you are. The editor of the long-defunct Barrow Herald, in Cumbria, expressed that relationship in these terms: \u201cNothing interests a man more than the news of his own neighbourhood. We continue our endeavours to cram our sheet full of facts \u2013 facts possessing as much local interest as possible. Our chief object is to make this paper a faithful record of everything of public importance that may transpire in Barrow.\u201d What happens when that object and faith is lost? A 2016 study by King\u2019s College London, found UK towns whose local newspapers had suffered closure showed a \u201cdemocracy deficit\u201d that resulted in measurably reduced community engagement by local people and a heightened distrust of public institutions. \u201cWe can all have our own social media account, but when local papers are depleted or in some cases simply don\u2019t exist, people lose a communal voice. They feel angry, not listened to and more likely to believe malicious rumour,\u201d Dr Martin Moore, the author of the study, observed. The absence was felt in the national conversation too. Good stories have usually filtered up the news chain from reporters on the ground. The King\u2019s study found that the third of parliamentary constituencies that were no longer covered by a dedicated daily local newspaper at the time of the 2015 general election received scant mention during it. The Cairncross Review into the crisis was published earlier this year. It drew a familiar portrait of the reasons for this decline. The business model of local news (and by extension local democracy) was entirely dependent on classified advertising. When estate agents, car dealers and other local retailers moved their investment in \u201ceyeballs\u201d on to search engines, money drained away. The collapse in finance led to cutbacks in newsrooms and papers became thinner and more distant from their audience, further reducing their appeal. In particular, Dame Frances Cairncross concluded, despite many honourable and heroic exceptions, that those elements that gave local news its storytelling bite and purpose became largely unaffordable: \u201cThe cost of investigative journalism is great and rarely seems to pay for itself\u2026\u201d Her recommendations to the government argued for a system of direct funding of public-interest news outlets and charitable status for some publishers. The review also recommended urgent investigation by the competition regulator into the dominance of the advertising market by Facebook and Google. Some small-scale efforts to fix local news have already been made along the lines that Cairncross suggested. The BBC \u2013 whose website is part of the competitive problem for commercial local news \u2013 created the Local Democracy Reporting Service to fund 150 journalists to cover council meetings and local public services, and to share stories both with local news organisations and the corporation. Most of the other investment in news-resuscitation is promised, ironically, by Facebook and Google, who have each launched ambitious $100m-a-year schemes (covering Britain and the US) to find ways to rebuild the local news economies that between them they have effectively destroyed. Cynics might believe these schemes to be a pre-emptive strike against regulators compromising elements of their profit engines. Google funded the Bureau Local, a branch of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, last year with a \u00a3500,000 grant, with the aim of supporting public-interest journalism in the UK by publishing free data online. Last week it announced a multimillion dollar investment in Archant, \u201cthe News Corp of East Anglia\u201d, which owns a range of successful local titles from the Hackney Gazette to the New European. The money was to be devoted to testing models of local online news in three \u201cnews deserts\u201d that have lost coverage. While such experiments take place \u2013 and there is cause for optimism, too, in smaller co-operative and community models of news gathering \u2013 the critical business of investigating local stories for local people persists in many areas and thrives in a few. The best journalism always has a sense of vocation. We feature insights from some of those outstanding professionals who, despite everything, continue to operate in that spirit, who understand the importance of getting the story straight for the people it affects most directly. Amanda Cameron, Bristol Post Late-career news journalist who exposed a mock slave auction in a local school Originally from New Zealand, former medical writer Amanda Cameron retrained as a journalist in her late 30s. Now 53, she is a local news democracy reporter for the Bristol Post, following a stint at the Bath Chronicle. Cameron\u2019s 2018 scoop about a mock slave auction at a Bath comprehensive went national: seven white pupils had tied a black pupil to a lamppost in the playground and whipped him. The headteacher tried to expel the pupils, but governors overruled him. \u201cThere was so much secrecy from the school when I was trying to find out what happened,\u201d Cameron says. \u201cIt felt very adversarial, and the community was very divided around what I was trying to do. Some people attacked me [verbally] for reporting it, wanting me to leave the school alone.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cThis was something that had to be challenged. I felt vindicated when the story came out.\u201d Cameron\u2019s early days in news journalism included a year at a New Zealand tabloid. \u201cThat was a real baptism of fire. There was so much competition to get headlines.\u201d Working at the Bath Chronicle in the UK was very different, she says. \u201cYou instantly got out into the community, and started to meet its people, and understand its issues fully.\u201d She reported a successful four-year fight by the residents of a local estate, Foxhill, to save their homes from demolition \u2013 which would have resulted in the loss of more than 200 social homes for rent \u2013 and she is passionate about local journalism\u2019s importance in the wider media landscape. \u201cLocally, you can follow up the impact of a story in a way that nationals haven\u2019t always got the time to commit to. Seeing what happens next is so important.\u201d Last October, Cameron started working as a local democracy reporter for the news publisher Reach from the offices of the Bristol Post. The local democracy initiative was launched by the BBC in 2017 and allocated 144 new reporters to news organisations across England, Scotland and Wales, to boost coverage of local authorities and other public sector meetings. It\u2019s been a breath of air, she says, to go into that detail; her recent stories include objections to the building of three new tower blocks on the site of a former fire station, and the accusation by a former GP that the local NHS is breaking national rules to deny people hip operations. \u201cThe reporting of the story is now the most important thing with my job, rather than finding an audience. There\u2019s still a pressure to feed the beast in local journalism, to think of the insatiable appetite of your audience above everything.\u201d She\u2019s also fired up by how vital her work feels in 2019: she\u2019s sitting before the seats of power at a regional level every day, finding out about decisions that will have considerable impact on local communities. \u201cMy priority is holding power to account locally, and it\u2019s such an important time to be doing this. People have got so inured to austerity in many ways. It\u2019s not a headline any more. It should be.\u201d Interview by Jude Rogers Jennifer Williams, Manchester Evening News Twice Orwell prize-nominated investigative reporter whose series on Manchester\u2019s hidden homelessness caused a political storm \u201cI keep being asked when I\u2019m moving to London as my work\u2019s getting known \u2018nationally\u2019,\u201d Jennifer Williams says, a note of weariness in her voice. \u201cI\u2019d rather ask a different question: why aren\u2019t there more reporters like me all over the country? Why are places outside London not properly represented?\u201d One of the UK\u2019s most respected investigative journalists, Williams has undertaken some impressively dogged and far-reaching reporting. Take last year\u2019s series Hidden Homeless. She\u2019d had \u201can inkling\u201d, she says, \u201cthat single men were being placed in derelict houses a few years ago. So I started to talk to people, and the story kept growing.\u201d She discovered that councils were placing placing families in flea-ridden, drug-infested guest houses, and went to see the mice, mould and rotting cupboards for herself. She found that people not in \u201cpriority need\u201d were being directed to unlivable dwellings by homeless associations and local housing providers, with their landlords collecting more than \u00a33,000 a month in housing benefit regardless. She also revealed how the deaths of homeless people were not being properly recorded, focusing on heartbreaking stories like that of Stefan Tomkins, who was crushed to death in the bin where he was sleeping. Williams\u2019s reporting had a significant impact: Manchester town hall announced an emergency review, mayor Andy Burnham promised to buy up slum properties, and the Office of National Statistics started recording the deaths of the homeless. It wasn\u2019t the first time her work had led to policy changes. In 2017, her investigation into the use of the drug Spice by care-leavers, prisoners and the homeless led to agencies recording incidents involving the drug for the first time, and won her specialist writer of the year at the Regional Press awards. Both investigations led to nominations for the Orwell prize. Was she proud when the authorities paid attention? \u201cYes. That\u2019s why I do what I do. I want my work to change things.\u201d Born in Ruthin, north Wales, Williams was fascinated by politics from a young age. She remembers hearing Geoffrey Howe\u2019s incendiary cabinet resignation speech in parliament in the car with her dad in 1990 (\u201che always had news on the radio\u201d) and the sleaze scandals of the John Major years. \u201cI found them so interesting and intriguing. I got so precocious about it, I was reading Private Eye when I was 12.\u201d Becoming a music fan in her teens, she changed tack, wanting to be a music journalist, but after an English degree at Manchester University, returned to her earlier interests. She did an NCTJ qualification by distance learning \u201cbecause I couldn\u2019t afford to go anywhere, and couldn\u2019t drive\u201d. She learned a lot \u2013 \u201cparticularly that you shouldn\u2019t learn about journalism at a distance. It\u2019s really important when you\u2019re a local journalist to be around people.\u201d That is more necessary than ever in the age of the internet, she says. When she started at the Stockport Express in 2007, their newsroom had one person to put articles online. \u201cIt was a crazy time to start out, because it was clear that everything was undergoing this massive revolution, and happening very quickly, and no one really knew what to do.\u201d Nevertheless, she believes that journalism\u2019s role in society hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether someone reads a story through Facebook or in print. The most important question is the same to me: are you still serving the readers properly in your work? If you are, then they\u2019ll read it. Williams\u2019s job involves plenty of pedestrian tasks too, such as reporting \u201con things that happen there and then\u201d,going to council and combined authority meetings, and keeping on top of Freedom of Information Act requests and long-term projects. Recent work includes reports on regional inequality in the UK and the troubling inefficiencies of the police\u2019s new computer system. She sees the future of local journalism as bright. \u201cHolding power to account and keeping on top of that for your readers is so important \u2013 and there\u2019s an appetite to hear more than that now.\u201d JR Tom Bristow, Archant press, Norwich Norwich-based investigations editor for regional Archant titles including Eastern Daily Press. Shortlisted for an Amnesty media award in 2011 and highly commended at last year\u2019s British journalism awards In July 2017, the Norwich-based newspaper Eastern Daily Press published a short news piece about an investigation at the heart of the local constabulary. One year earlier, a Norfolk police doctor had been convicted after admitting to 13 indecent assaults against female officers. Questions were raised about an initial cover-up \u2013 the assaults dated as far back as 1993 \u2013 but, according to a Norfolk police statement, an investigation by Essex police had concluded with no charges or calls for further action. \u201cAfter we published,\u201d says Tom Bristow, 32, \u201cvictims of the doctor got in touch, very annoyed, saying: \u2018Hang on a sec, this isn\u2019t what happened.\u2019\u201d They said the paper needed to find the full Essex investigation report if they wanted tell the whole story. \u201cAnd that,\u201d he says, \u201cis where we came in.\u201d In 2016, Bristow, originally from London, was appointed to a newly formed investigations unit at Archant, which owns Eastern Daily Press and more than 50 other local newspapers around the country. \u201cWe were getting all these tips that we weren\u2019t pursuing because we were so focused on the day-to-day,\u201d he says. The idea was that, as editor of the three-person unit, serving local papers in Suffolk and London as well as Norfolk, Bristow would be able to step back and focus on knottier stories that required time and resources to unpick. Bristow had form in this area. On his first reporting job with the Southport Visiter, soon after graduating from Edinburgh university, he carried out an investigation into Lancashire gang masters, which got him shortlisted for the Amnesty media awards in 2011. \u201cThat really gave me confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my first job, on a tiny weekly paper, and I was being listed alongside the BBC. I thought, wow, this is worth doing.\u201deading up the investigations unit at Archant feels like \u201ca very unusual and luxury position\u201d, says Bristow. He has, for example, pursued tip-offs about rogue landlords around Norfolk, leading to several hard-hitting pieces about people in desperate rental situations; he also edited a Paul Foot award-winning series, written by Emma Youle for the Hackney Gazette, about homelessness in London. For the Norfolk police story, Bristow and his reporter Dominic Gilbert spent weeks trying to get hold of the investigation report, while Gilbert went out and spoke to the victims. \u201cIt turns out Essex police did a really thorough job, reporting all kinds of failings, and none of that was mentioned in the Norfolk press release.\u201d Their efforts didn\u2019t go unrecognised: the resulting stories, published by the Eastern Daily Press in November and December 2017, were highly commended at last year\u2019s British journalism awards. Without well-resourced, regional journalism such as this, Bristow believes, \u201clocal power would not be held to account across the country. Because of the traditional strength of the local press in Britain no other institutions have developed to do this. There\u2019s got to be something there to let people know what the council and the police are up to, and to name and shame criminals as they go through the courts.\u201d The alternative, according to Bristow, is bleak. \u201cLocal democracy simply doesn\u2019t work if people aren\u2019t kept informed.\u201d Interview by Killian Fox Aamir Mohammed, Wales Online Named young journalist of the year for hard-hitting multimedia stories about family abduction and online suicide The 2019 Society of Editors\u2019 young journalist of the year was only nine months into his job at Wales Online (the online home of Welsh daily the Western Mail and its sister title, Wales on Sunday) when he won the award \u2013 and he still hadn\u2019t finished his postponed M.A. dissertation. \u201c\u201cIt\u2019s probably not the right way round to do it,\u201d Aamir Mohammed says. One of the stories that most impressed the judges was Mohammed\u2019s 2018 long-form feature about a Cardiff-born woman, Safia Saleh, who was abducted from the city in 1986 as a toddler by her father, who took her to his home country, Yemen. Now, with Yemen in the grip of civil war \u2013 and the UK government having no evacuation procedures for British citizens - a councillor tipped off Mohammed that Saleh\u2019s mother\u2019s was trying to get visas and emergency passports to help Safia and her young family come back. \u201cI knew for [the story] really to have an impact, I needed to get a real sense of what Safia\u2019s life was like,\u201d Mohammed says. \u201cI needed as much detail as possible about how she was surviving her situation, including getting video and pictures.\u201d He spent time with her family in Cardiff and interviewed Safia in Yemen over Whatsapp with a translator, and obtained photographs and videos from Safia. Published in late November 2018, the piece had an immediate effect: Safia got her documents, and was reunited with her mother in January. \u201cThat was a brilliant feeling,\u201d he says, \u201cto have made such a difference.\u201d Mohammed didn\u2019t think about becoming a journalist until he was 15, when a careers adviser pointed out his good grades in English. Mohammed\u2019s father ran a clothes shop, and read the South Wales Echo every day, so his son knew local journalism; on his English and media degree he became \u201creally obsessed\u201d with news blogging. Becoming one of only 20 students on Cardiff University\u2019s news journalism MA (700 applied in his year), Mohammed became known as \u201cthe patch king\u201d for getting lots of stories from his allocated area of Rhymney \u2013 a fact he reveals with a shy pride. \u201cGetting people to trust you and know you care about them is what makes a difference,\u201d he says. Online community groups are a huge help to his work, he says. A post he spotted in his first term of university about a spate of youth crime was his first experience of making local contacts \u2013 he messaged the woman who posted it, then met her in person. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to build that one-to-one contact,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce people saw my stories go live, and trusted me, I was inundated.\u201d Another story commended by the Society of Editors was a feature about the drug Spice in Butetown in Cardiff for which he interviewed users and spent time at the medical centres giving out methadone. And another (written after a local man broadcast his suicide on the internet) was a harrowing piece about online \u201csuicide rooms\u201d, for which Mohammed joined one such chatroom on the dark web. \u201cThose are important stories to be told, so you\u2019ve got to keep telling yourself: don\u2019t get caught up. Keep a clear mind. It\u2019s your job.\u201d The job is not a glamorous one, neither are the hours particularly healthy, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s every evening, every weekend, if I\u2019m honest. You\u2019re never really off as a local journalist.\u201d He spends a lot of time drinking coffee at community groups, catching up with people he knows, but says he enjoys going to work every single day. \u201cI really like representing underrepresented communities. Even though the pressure to get big stories is tough, that\u2019s what really drives me.\u201d JR Karin Goodwin, The Ferret, Glasgow Glasgow-based freelance journalist who writes for investigative platform the Ferret \u201cMore than ever, the public desperately needs good journalism that holds people to account and covers stories important to local communities,\u201d says Karin Goodwin, who has lived in Glasgow for nearly 20 years and now writes about social affairs. \u201cA lot of the old news models have failed the public, and we need new and better ones to take their place.\u201d Goodwin, who grew up in Ayrshire, became a journalist in her mid-20s. She trained with the Big Issue and worked for the Sunday Herald and the Sunday Times before going freelance. In April, for her reporting on homelessness and drug addiction in Scotland, Goodwin won the prestigious Nicola Barry award at the Scottish press awards. Two years ago, Goodwin joined Scotland-based investigative platform the Ferret, which was set up by a group of journalists in 2015. \u201cThey were frustrated with the current news model that doesn\u2019t invest in in-depth reporting or investigations,\u201d she says, \u201cso they set up a co-op which is owned by its members, who are paying subscribers. We also have a couple of funders\u201d \u2013 including Luminate and the Seedbed Trust \u2013 \u201cbut it\u2019s really our members that are at the heart of the Ferret.\u201d Though not exclusively local in its reporting, the platform covers regional public-interest stories at a level of detail few local newspapers can match. Periodically, the platform polls its members on subjects they would like to read more about and then covers them in detail over an extended period. One area that Goodwin has been covering is homelessness. Late last year, in partnership with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, she contributed to a series on homeless deaths around the UK, revealing that at least 94 men and women in Scotland had died while homeless over the previous 12 months. Goodwin\u2019s in-depth knowledge of Glasgow added an extra dimension to her reporting. \u201cA man died in the local night shelter here, and just weeks before, I had interviewed him for a separate piece about homelessness,\u201d she said, \u201cso I was able to go back and listen to that recording, which was quite harrowing, knowing what happened to him subsequently.\u201d As well as appearing on the Ferret, Goodwin\u2019s articles ran on the BIJ\u2019s Bureau Local website, alongside related stories from across the country. \u201cThen Channel 4 News covered it and were able to show that [homeless people dying in high numbers] was a UK-wide issue. That\u2019s the strength of organisations like the Bureau,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s able to reach out and tap into the resources of journalists right across the country.\u201d For Goodwin, maintaining a close, two-way relationship with readers is crucial. \u201cAt the Ferret we try to make sure we\u2019re very much engaged with our members and we report the things that are important to them, as well as things we think are in the public interest,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s a way of getting back to building communities around the work that we do.\u201d KF Annette Belcher, Birmingham Live Birmingham-based content editor at the Local Democracy Reporting Service Belcher, 35, was born in the Black Country and studied journalism in Wolverhampton before getting her first job with the Trinity Mirror group (now known as Reach). Her career has involved several transitions. \u201cI started as a reporter on our weekly title and progressed on to a daily, the Birmingham Mail. Then it was the transition from print to online, becoming a multimedia journalist on [the Mail\u2019s sister website] Birmingham Live.\u201d In her 12 years as a reporter based in Birmingham, she is most proud of the #BrumFeeds campaign for the Trussell Trust, which operates food banks across Birmingham. \u201cWe\u2019d been writing a lot in Birmingham Live about how people are becoming more and more reliant on food banks, but we felt that there was more we could do. So our aim when we launched in April 2018 was to collect 100 tonnes of food [from readers and the general public], equivalent to 100,000 meals, but we managed to blitz that figure and more than double it by December,\u201d says Belcher. \u201cWe did two massive events in the city centre: one was the launch and the second one was called the Big Drop, where we managed to collect a tonne of food in one day.\u201d Now her role has changed again: in April, Belcher joined the Local Democracy Reporting Service, launched by the BBC in 2017 as a counterbalance to clickbait, funding regional journalists to report on council meetings, crime stories and other areas that might not otherwise be covered in depth by local newspapers in the digital era. Though Belcher works out of the Birmingham Live offices, her role as content editor involves liaising with news desks across the country to promote LDRS material and tailor it for individual news websites. \u201cLocal journalism is a changing landscape, and very different from the days of print,\u201d says Belcher. \u201cBut with online platforms we\u2019re able to get even more information out there, cover stories in greater depth and better serve our communities, which is what local journalism is all about.\u201d Thanks to campaigns such as #Brumfeeds, combined with an intimate understanding of local readerships, the appetite for local journalism remains strong, Belcher believes. \u201cPeople really feel that they have a voice,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen national titles have come and gone, we\u2019ll still have that place within local communities. We have longevity because we\u2019ve built up loyalty with them.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I meet Philip Pullman 24 hours after he has got into trouble for idly musing on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philippullman/status/1167043783634104326?lang=en\" title=\"\">Twitter</a> that he would like to hang Boris Johnson. \u201cIt was a silly joke,\u201d he admits, looking slightly embarrassed as he enters his sitting room with a plate of biscuits for us, perching them on teetering stacks of books beneath which there is said to be a coffee table. He says his publishers were a bit miffed: threatening to murder the prime minister was clearly not how they had agreed to start the publicity campaign for his forthcoming children\u2019s novel, <em>The Secret Commonwealth</em>, and Pullman had to publicly retract his words after there were complaints. \u201cBut,\u201d the 72-year-old author adds, his tone brightening, while one of his dogs clambers on to his lap and the other maintains a vigil beside the biscuits, \u201cthe upshot was I gained 2,000 followers on Twitter!\u201d</p> <p>Pullman creates magical realms in his award-winning fiction, writing it in his 16th-century farmhouse in a village outside Oxford, where he lives with his wife and his ukuleles and cockapoos and overflowing shelves. But if I expected to meet someone otherworldly, I was wrong. Pullman, who has two sons and several grandchildren, is very much of <em>this</em> world, and can talk in detail about the shadowy machinations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a> as well as the designs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/victoria-beckham\" title=\"\">Victoria Beckham</a> and the woodworking videos he sometimes gets hooked watching on YouTube. His observation of the government is not one-sided: he tells me that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>, as education secretary, once invited him to discuss literacy. Pullman told him that \u201cthe basics\u201d weren\u2019t grammar and spelling, as Gove believed, \u201cbecause everybody who\u2019s got a word processor knows you correct those at the last minute,\u201d but rather nursery rhymes, songs, a love of language itself. Nothing came of it, \u201cbut I\u2019ll give him credit: he was very courteous and he listened, and there was a civil servant making notes. And Gove cracked a joke about me being \u2018at the heart of the Magisterium now\u2019, so he had plainly read my books.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a decent joke, given that the Magisterium is the shadowy, authoritarian body that governs the country in Pullman\u2019s two trilogies: <em>His Dark Materials</em>, which began in 1995, and now <em>The</em> <em>Book of Dust</em>, of which <em>The Secret Commonwealth</em> is the second part. His best-known character, Lyra, is the heroine of all of them. The first trilogy took her from age 11 to early teens. The second trilogy began with her as a baby, in a prequel, but now leaps forward to Lyra\u2019s early 20s, when she is finally an undergraduate at Oxford, like Pullman was. Naturally, she is once again doing battle with power, sniffing out corruption and fighting it as David to the Magisterium\u2019s Goliath.</p> <p>It is set in an unreal, almost British past, yet this book feels more consciously pegged to our present than the others. There are references to refugees landing on Greek islands and a character named Nur Huda el-Wahabi, after a schoolgirl who died in Grenfell Tower. (Her teacher won a bid in the <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/pullman-name-character-nur-huda-el-wahabi-after-bids-top-32k-576121\" title=\"\">Authors for Grenfell Tower auction</a> to name a character in his next book and Pullman was very keen). Halfway through the book, Lyra explains what \u201cbullshitting\u201d really is, and, shortly afterwards, a character from the Magisterium is heard elsewhere telling someone that, \u201cWe should delicately and subtly undermine the idea that truth and facts are possible in the first place. Once the people have become doubtful about the truth of anything, all kinds of things will be open to us.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder if people such as Gove, Johnson and Trump, with their \u201cfake news\u201d, \u201chad enough of experts\u201d and Brexiteering narratives were on his mind when he wrote it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca4114883e2335bc386625447290841f01e47d3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca4114883e2335bc386625447290841f01e47d3a/9_320_1363_817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The prime minister doesn\u2019t mind who he hurts. He doesn\u2019t mind if he destroys the truth or not\u2019: on Boris Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really for me to judge,\u201d he says, preferring not to tell people what to take from his work, explicitly, though \u201cit might be the case\u201d. He nods. \u201cInevitably, I am affected by the political background of the times, because I\u2019m a citizen as well as a writer, and I\u2019m interested in political news.\u201d</p> <p>Pullman is more than happy to talk about politics in itself, though. He believes the EU referendum was \u201ca terrible thing, a terrible mistake. Parliament is now not sovereign any more. It\u2019s the will of the people that\u2019s apparently sovereign, and this is terribly dangerous because the will of the people can easily be manipulated, as we saw in Germany. Dictators <em>love</em> referendums.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The will of the people can easily be manipulated</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He lives in a Tory stronghold, where he has to vote Lib Dem, because a vote for Labour would be wasted, so he strongly believes in electoral reform. In any case, the thing that raises our current politics \u201cfrom farce to tragedy is the lack of opposition from the Labour party. People say they elected the wrong Miliband. I think they elected the wrong Ed actually. Ed Balls would have been a marvellous leader. So that was a big mistake, and then saddling themselves with an electoral system that weighs it so much in favour of the trade unions. That\u2019s populism again. If party leaders were elected simply and solely by MPs, we\u2019d get a much better choice of leaders. But it\u2019s also open to corruption of the Tory sort, where they\u2019ve managed to franchise the choice of their leadership out to elderly members of bowls clubs. That\u2019s all right, they deserve a vote too \u2013 but <em>all</em> of the vote?\u201d</p> <p>Did he ever believe in Corbyn?</p> <p>\u201cCorbyn is most at home on the back of a lorry with a microphone in his hand. He\u2019s one of nature\u2019s backbench rebels. He\u2019s not at home in committee rooms making deals, agreeing with, making compromises. He\u2019s not formed, by nature, to be the leader of a party, let alone a prime minister, and it\u2019s an absolute tragedy that he\u2019s now locked into it.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll take that as a no, then. As for the prime minister: \u201cWell, he\u2019s a psychopath. Or he\u2019s a sociopath. He\u2019s born without the normal human reactions of shame, embarrassment, you know, all those things\u2026 He\u2019s without them. He doesn\u2019t mind who he hurts. He doesn\u2019t mind whether he destroys the truth or not. In those respects, of course, he\u2019s learned a lot from Trump; that you can go into a high office of state and throw your weight around and break things, and nobody minds, or nobody manages to stop you. And the opposition is so helpless, so useless.\u201d</p> <p>If Johnson does hold an election, Pullman suspects he will pitch it as \u201cpeople versus parliament \u2013 and he\u2019ll be on the side of the people. I mean, it\u2019s just a joke \u2013 but he could do it and he could win and it\u2019s terribly dangerous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"702ed81b07f2206aa12718f5429b9762a0d1aa1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/702ed81b07f2206aa12718f5429b9762a0d1aa1b/1081_117_2417_1450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove giving a thumbs-up during the British Conservative party leadership campaign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018To regard the basics as being spelling properly, and not ending a sentence with a preposition, is a monstrous perversion\u2019. Pictured: Michael Gove.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vudi Xhymshiti/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I mention that the first trilogy of Lyra books, in which children are taken away into camps and mistreated, stripped of their daemons (their animal souls), also feels prescient now, looking at the American border with Mexico.</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d Pullman says. \u201cGosh, I\u2019m a prophet and I don\u2019t know it. We\u2019re living in very interesting times and there\u2019s going to be a big crisis of some sort, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p> <p>A TV production of <em>His Dark Materials</em> is coming soon to the BBC and HBO, starring James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Pullman seems reasonably interested when I bring it up, but points out that it\u2019s hardly the first production of it. There were the stage plays at the National Theatre in 2003, then the audiobook, which he found \u201ca bit disconcerting\u201d because so many of the cast were from <em>The Archers</em>. Then the Hollywood film of the trilogy, which got cancelled after the first one, which was sad, because he loves Nicole Kidman and wanted to see her reach the stage of her character\u2019s trajectory where she is \u201cbeing overpowered by the love for Lyra that she couldn\u2019t help feeling\u201d. (He had written to Kidman himself to ask her to be in it. \u201cBut if the letter hadn\u2019t worked, I was going to cross out her name and write \u2018Dear Cate Blanchett\u2019 instead.\u201d)</p> <p>Disconcertingly, the new show\u2019s American executive producer has issued a statement denying that Pullman\u2019s stories are anti-religion, which is hardly accurate, but clearly something deemed necessary to assuage the Bible Belt, which raged about the movie and its anti-Christian devilry. I bring this up and Pullman sighs, gutturally.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica is an entirely different place,\u201d he says. \u201cWe kind of fooled ourselves into thinking we can understand them.\u201d</p> <p>Interestingly, though, the new book finds Lyra losing her way with magic and becoming something of a down-hearted rationalist. This takes us to the heart of Pullman\u2019s paradox: that his books seek to undo the institution of Christianity while he remains steeped in its liturgical beauty; and that he respects science so deeply that he uses it to furnish his impossible, imaginary worlds. <em>The Secret Commonwealth</em> ends, after 687 pages, with the words \u201cTo be continued.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I am spared to write the third book, all will be made clear, I hope,\u201d he says, half joking, half not. After years of prostate trouble and surgery, and his wife\u2019s own medical issues, he says that, \u201cNeither of us is in very good health, and travelling anywhere or going out for long evenings are not really possible any more. But I don\u2019t mind that a bit. I don\u2019t want to travel anywhere.\u201d Indeed, he researched some of the faraway locations in his new book, such as Istanbul, by strolling down the roads on Google Street View. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s summoning all his strength to put on a brave face for the interview, but he does seem on excellent form today, making the tea, showing me round, giving me a lift in their car back to Oxford station.</p> <p>And, of course, there\u2019s always Twitter, where he remains as lively as ever. \u201cI got into terrible trouble a year or two ago because I said, in all innocence, \u2018Look what is this quarrel between feminists and trans people? What\u2019s the argument about?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The prime minister is without the normal human reactions of shame and embarrassment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He claims, rather mischievously, that he still doesn\u2019t understand the debate about whether gender can be overthrown biologically or socially, but I suggest it\u2019s a relevant topic to his books, in which almost all children are born with a daemon of the opposite sex, who represents the other part of them, perhaps their soul. The daemon changes animal until puberty, when it takes a fixed form and the child finds out who they really are. It does make me think about the question of trans children and blocking puberty. He turns very thoughtful about this.</p> <p>\u201cIf I had a child, boy or girl, who felt passionately from an early age, <em>manifestly</em> that they were in the wrong body, I hope I would be understanding and as kind as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t think I\u2019d do is hasten them away to an endocrinologist. I know that if you want to transition, it is physically more plausible, or persuasive, if you do it before puberty, but is a child before puberty capable of\u2026 I mean the answer is, we don\u2019t know, do we? We don\u2019t know. The only thing we can do is to be as kind as possible.\u201d</p> <p>A former teacher, Pullman is hugely interested in what we tell children and how we raise them. He is a fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelrosen\" title=\"\">Michael Rosen</a>, and believes that <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/some-kids-i-taught-and-what-they-taught-me-9781509840298.html\" title=\"\">Kate Clanchy\u2019s book </a><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/some-kids-i-taught-and-what-they-taught-me-9781509840298.html\" title=\"\">Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me</a></em> \u201cshould be in every single staff room\u201d.</p> <p>He stopped teaching before the national curriculum even came in, \u201cso I\u2019m really speaking like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells when I talk about education now.\u201d As for the literacy regime in primary schools today: \u201cTo regard the basics as being spelling properly, and not ending a sentence with a preposition, is a monstrous perversion of everything that\u2019s right and true. Fronted adverbials? Nonsense. It drives me <em>mad</em> to think about them teaching that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"908ec280ccd1819d94ded467fa18757ad52bea07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/908ec280ccd1819d94ded467fa18757ad52bea07/0_1151_4890_2932/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Pullman standing with his hands in his pockets in his garden, smiling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re living in very interesting times and there\u2019s going to be a big crisis of some sort\u2019: Philip Pullman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma Hardy/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has seen SATs tests where they say, \u201cSpend 15 minutes making your plan and 45 minutes writing the story.\u201d \u201cWhen I used to speak to classes, I would say yes you must make a plan when you write the story, but write the story first and make the plan afterwards, because that way the plan will be exactly like the story and you\u2019ll get more marks.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not joking \u2013 this is how he does it himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not doing it backwards. I call it doing it the right way.\u201d</p> <p>We discuss the growing obsession in academy schools with strictness. He says that when he was at school, his teachers had been in the war, so weren\u2019t going to be scared by a bunch of kids. \u201cThe French teacher had been on the Arctic convoys; the geography teacher had driven tanks in the desert. The physics teacher, he was a brute, he\u2019d flown Catalina seaplanes across the Atlantic.\u201d When Pullman himself came to teach, he lacked their sense of authority, \u201cso the only thing I could do to keep them in order was to tell them stories.\u201d He also observed that every class already had a king and a queen who the other children looked up to, so if you sussed out who they were, and focussed on them for the first few weeks, the rest of the class would follow.</p> <p>We go outside to look at the decorative boxes he\u2019s been making in his carpentry workshop, only to discover that the two cockapoos, Coco and Mixie, who look like designer doggies, but behave like feral beasts, have escaped. Some minutes later, after Pullman has set off down his acres of land to look for them, I find them in the next-door neighbours\u2019 garden, having the time of their lives. We haul them back into the house and discover that they have also eaten the biscuits, leaving a trail of fallen books behind them.</p> <p><em>The Secret Commonwealth: The Book of Dust Volume Two by Philip Pullman is published on 3 October by Penguin at \u00a320.

      "bodyText": "I meet Philip Pullman 24 hours after he has got into trouble for idly musing on Twitter that he would like to hang Boris Johnson. \u201cIt was a silly joke,\u201d he admits, looking slightly embarrassed as he enters his sitting room with a plate of biscuits for us, perching them on teetering stacks of books beneath which there is said to be a coffee table. He says his publishers were a bit miffed: threatening to murder the prime minister was clearly not how they had agreed to start the publicity campaign for his forthcoming children\u2019s novel, The Secret Commonwealth, and Pullman had to publicly retract his words after there were complaints. \u201cBut,\u201d the 72-year-old author adds, his tone brightening, while one of his dogs clambers on to his lap and the other maintains a vigil beside the biscuits, \u201cthe upshot was I gained 2,000 followers on Twitter!\u201d Pullman creates magical realms in his award-winning fiction, writing it in his 16th-century farmhouse in a village outside Oxford, where he lives with his wife and his ukuleles and cockapoos and overflowing shelves. But if I expected to meet someone otherworldly, I was wrong. Pullman, who has two sons and several grandchildren, is very much of this world, and can talk in detail about the shadowy machinations of Dominic Cummings as well as the designs of Victoria Beckham and the woodworking videos he sometimes gets hooked watching on YouTube. His observation of the government is not one-sided: he tells me that Michael Gove, as education secretary, once invited him to discuss literacy. Pullman told him that \u201cthe basics\u201d weren\u2019t grammar and spelling, as Gove believed, \u201cbecause everybody who\u2019s got a word processor knows you correct those at the last minute,\u201d but rather nursery rhymes, songs, a love of language itself. Nothing came of it, \u201cbut I\u2019ll give him credit: he was very courteous and he listened, and there was a civil servant making notes. And Gove cracked a joke about me being \u2018at the heart of the Magisterium now\u2019, so he had plainly read my books.\u201d It\u2019s a decent joke, given that the Magisterium is the shadowy, authoritarian body that governs the country in Pullman\u2019s two trilogies: His Dark Materials, which began in 1995, and now The Book of Dust, of which The Secret Commonwealth is the second part. His best-known character, Lyra, is the heroine of all of them. The first trilogy took her from age 11 to early teens. The second trilogy began with her as a baby, in a prequel, but now leaps forward to Lyra\u2019s early 20s, when she is finally an undergraduate at Oxford, like Pullman was. Naturally, she is once again doing battle with power, sniffing out corruption and fighting it as David to the Magisterium\u2019s Goliath. It is set in an unreal, almost British past, yet this book feels more consciously pegged to our present than the others. There are references to refugees landing on Greek islands and a character named Nur Huda el-Wahabi, after a schoolgirl who died in Grenfell Tower. (Her teacher won a bid in the Authors for Grenfell Tower auction to name a character in his next book and Pullman was very keen). Halfway through the book, Lyra explains what \u201cbullshitting\u201d really is, and, shortly afterwards, a character from the Magisterium is heard elsewhere telling someone that, \u201cWe should delicately and subtly undermine the idea that truth and facts are possible in the first place. Once the people have become doubtful about the truth of anything, all kinds of things will be open to us.\u201d I wonder if people such as Gove, Johnson and Trump, with their \u201cfake news\u201d, \u201chad enough of experts\u201d and Brexiteering narratives were on his mind when he wrote it. \u201cIt\u2019s not really for me to judge,\u201d he says, preferring not to tell people what to take from his work, explicitly, though \u201cit might be the case\u201d. He nods. \u201cInevitably, I am affected by the political background of the times, because I\u2019m a citizen as well as a writer, and I\u2019m interested in political news.\u201d Pullman is more than happy to talk about politics in itself, though. He believes the EU referendum was \u201ca terrible thing, a terrible mistake. Parliament is now not sovereign any more. It\u2019s the will of the people that\u2019s apparently sovereign, and this is terribly dangerous because the will of the people can easily be manipulated, as we saw in Germany. Dictators love referendums.\u201d He lives in a Tory stronghold, where he has to vote Lib Dem, because a vote for Labour would be wasted, so he strongly believes in electoral reform. In any case, the thing that raises our current politics \u201cfrom farce to tragedy is the lack of opposition from the Labour party. People say they elected the wrong Miliband. I think they elected the wrong Ed actually. Ed Balls would have been a marvellous leader. So that was a big mistake, and then saddling themselves with an electoral system that weighs it so much in favour of the trade unions. That\u2019s populism again. If party leaders were elected simply and solely by MPs, we\u2019d get a much better choice of leaders. But it\u2019s also open to corruption of the Tory sort, where they\u2019ve managed to franchise the choice of their leadership out to elderly members of bowls clubs. That\u2019s all right, they deserve a vote too \u2013 but all of the vote?\u201d Did he ever believe in Corbyn? \u201cCorbyn is most at home on the back of a lorry with a microphone in his hand. He\u2019s one of nature\u2019s backbench rebels. He\u2019s not at home in committee rooms making deals, agreeing with, making compromises. He\u2019s not formed, by nature, to be the leader of a party, let alone a prime minister, and it\u2019s an absolute tragedy that he\u2019s now locked into it.\u201d I\u2019ll take that as a no, then. As for the prime minister: \u201cWell, he\u2019s a psychopath. Or he\u2019s a sociopath. He\u2019s born without the normal human reactions of shame, embarrassment, you know, all those things\u2026 He\u2019s without them. He doesn\u2019t mind who he hurts. He doesn\u2019t mind whether he destroys the truth or not. In those respects, of course, he\u2019s learned a lot from Trump; that you can go into a high office of state and throw your weight around and break things, and nobody minds, or nobody manages to stop you. And the opposition is so helpless, so useless.\u201d If Johnson does hold an election, Pullman suspects he will pitch it as \u201cpeople versus parliament \u2013 and he\u2019ll be on the side of the people. I mean, it\u2019s just a joke \u2013 but he could do it and he could win and it\u2019s terribly dangerous.\u201d I mention that the first trilogy of Lyra books, in which children are taken away into camps and mistreated, stripped of their daemons (their animal souls), also feels prescient now, looking at the American border with Mexico. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d Pullman says. \u201cGosh, I\u2019m a prophet and I don\u2019t know it. We\u2019re living in very interesting times and there\u2019s going to be a big crisis of some sort, isn\u2019t there?\u201d A TV production of His Dark Materials is coming soon to the BBC and HBO, starring James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Pullman seems reasonably interested when I bring it up, but points out that it\u2019s hardly the first production of it. There were the stage plays at the National Theatre in 2003, then the audiobook, which he found \u201ca bit disconcerting\u201d because so many of the cast were from The Archers. Then the Hollywood film of the trilogy, which got cancelled after the first one, which was sad, because he loves Nicole Kidman and wanted to see her reach the stage of her character\u2019s trajectory where she is \u201cbeing overpowered by the love for Lyra that she couldn\u2019t help feeling\u201d. (He had written to Kidman himself to ask her to be in it. \u201cBut if the letter hadn\u2019t worked, I was going to cross out her name and write \u2018Dear Cate Blanchett\u2019 instead.\u201d) Disconcertingly, the new show\u2019s American executive producer has issued a statement denying that Pullman\u2019s stories are anti-religion, which is hardly accurate, but clearly something deemed necessary to assuage the Bible Belt, which raged about the movie and its anti-Christian devilry. I bring this up and Pullman sighs, gutturally. \u201cAmerica is an entirely different place,\u201d he says. \u201cWe kind of fooled ourselves into thinking we can understand them.\u201d Interestingly, though, the new book finds Lyra losing her way with magic and becoming something of a down-hearted rationalist. This takes us to the heart of Pullman\u2019s paradox: that his books seek to undo the institution of Christianity while he remains steeped in its liturgical beauty; and that he respects science so deeply that he uses it to furnish his impossible, imaginary worlds. The Secret Commonwealth ends, after 687 pages, with the words \u201cTo be continued.\u201d \u201cIf I am spared to write the third book, all will be made clear, I hope,\u201d he says, half joking, half not. After years of prostate trouble and surgery, and his wife\u2019s own medical issues, he says that, \u201cNeither of us is in very good health, and travelling anywhere or going out for long evenings are not really possible any more. But I don\u2019t mind that a bit. I don\u2019t want to travel anywhere.\u201d Indeed, he researched some of the faraway locations in his new book, such as Istanbul, by strolling down the roads on Google Street View. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s summoning all his strength to put on a brave face for the interview, but he does seem on excellent form today, making the tea, showing me round, giving me a lift in their car back to Oxford station. And, of course, there\u2019s always Twitter, where he remains as lively as ever. \u201cI got into terrible trouble a year or two ago because I said, in all innocence, \u2018Look what is this quarrel between feminists and trans people? What\u2019s the argument about?\u2019\u201d He claims, rather mischievously, that he still doesn\u2019t understand the debate about whether gender can be overthrown biologically or socially, but I suggest it\u2019s a relevant topic to his books, in which almost all children are born with a daemon of the opposite sex, who represents the other part of them, perhaps their soul. The daemon changes animal until puberty, when it takes a fixed form and the child finds out who they really are. It does make me think about the question of trans children and blocking puberty. He turns very thoughtful about this. \u201cIf I had a child, boy or girl, who felt passionately from an early age, manifestly that they were in the wrong body, I hope I would be understanding and as kind as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t think I\u2019d do is hasten them away to an endocrinologist. I know that if you want to transition, it is physically more plausible, or persuasive, if you do it before puberty, but is a child before puberty capable of\u2026 I mean the answer is, we don\u2019t know, do we? We don\u2019t know. The only thing we can do is to be as kind as possible.\u201d A former teacher, Pullman is hugely interested in what we tell children and how we raise them. He is a fan of Michael Rosen, and believes that Kate Clanchy\u2019s book Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me \u201cshould be in every single staff room\u201d. He stopped teaching before the national curriculum even came in, \u201cso I\u2019m really speaking like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells when I talk about education now.\u201d As for the literacy regime in primary schools today: \u201cTo regard the basics as being spelling properly, and not ending a sentence with a preposition, is a monstrous perversion of everything that\u2019s right and true. Fronted adverbials? Nonsense. It drives me mad to think about them teaching that.\u201d He has seen SATs tests where they say, \u201cSpend 15 minutes making your plan and 45 minutes writing the story.\u201d \u201cWhen I used to speak to classes, I would say yes you must make a plan when you write the story, but write the story first and make the plan afterwards, because that way the plan will be exactly like the story and you\u2019ll get more marks.\u201d He\u2019s not joking \u2013 this is how he does it himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not doing it backwards. I call it doing it the right way.\u201d We discuss the growing obsession in academy schools with strictness. He says that when he was at school, his teachers had been in the war, so weren\u2019t going to be scared by a bunch of kids. \u201cThe French teacher had been on the Arctic convoys; the geography teacher had driven tanks in the desert. The physics teacher, he was a brute, he\u2019d flown Catalina seaplanes across the Atlantic.\u201d When Pullman himself came to teach, he lacked their sense of authority, \u201cso the only thing I could do to keep them in order was to tell them stories.\u201d He also observed that every class already had a king and a queen who the other children looked up to, so if you sussed out who they were, and focussed on them for the first few weeks, the rest of the class would follow. We go outside to look at the decorative boxes he\u2019s been making in his carpentry workshop, only to discover that the two cockapoos, Coco and Mixie, who look like designer doggies, but behave like feral beasts, have escaped. Some minutes later, after Pullman has set off down his acres of land to look for them, I find them in the next-door neighbours\u2019 garden, having the time of their lives. We haul them back into the house and discover that they have also eaten the biscuits, leaving a trail of fallen books behind them.

What more could anybody want?</p> <p>Excellent, that is, as long as you don\u2019t worry about details such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/22/west-ham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">limp 2-0 defeat at West Ham</a> last Sunday. Or that the weekend kicked off with United eighth in the Premier League table. Or that a club with a proud cavalier tradition have scored just 18 goals in their last 20 games. Or that the one outfielder of undoubted outstanding quality spent the summer trying to leave. Or that Old Trafford, essentially undeveloped in more than two decades, has an entirely appropriate air of shabbiness. Or that this is, relative to the rest of the league, the worst Manchester United squad in at least 30 years. Or that the share price has fallen 36% since its peak at the end of August last year.</p> <p>It is that last detail that might prompt the most concern in the United boardroom. Revenues may be at record levels but last week United announced a fourth-quarter loss of \u00a322.2m. Failure to qualify for the Champions League this season will make that hard to recover, particularly if United do not finish in the top four again this season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"36c5b7a0bfc84a683912f93ff5da35337857f84a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36c5b7a0bfc84a683912f93ff5da35337857f84a/0_0_683_2361/289.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United team line-ups from 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019.\" width=\"289\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United team line-ups from 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No Credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On-pitch underperformance is finally beginning to hit the bottom line. The problem now is the rot runs so deep it is in danger of toxifying everything. It\u2019s easy to say that Alexis S\u00e1nchez was past it when he arrived at United, but Fred wasn\u2019t. \u00c9ric Bailly wasn\u2019t. Henrikh Mkhitaryan wasn\u2019t. United have become a club that drag players down.</p> <p>Then there are those who once bristled with promise and then stagnated: Adnan Januzaj, Luke Shaw, Phil Jones, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard. The danger of that pattern continuing seems all the more acute now United have switched to signing youth.</p> <p>Daniel James has had a very good start to his United career. He has scored three goals, all of them of supreme quality. He is undoubtedly a player of great potential. But he is 21, came into the Swansea side only last season and had never played a Premier League game before August. He is somebody to be bedded in slowly, to be given time to develop. He should not be United\u2019s main creative threat and it\u2019s unfair to saddle him with that burden.</p> <p>It\u2019s true in part that James has been thrust front and centre by injuries but that itself only raises further questions. How have United ended up with a squad so imbalanced that a couple of absentees can have such a profound impact? And just why have United already suffered so many noncontact injuries this season? Bad luck can happen, of course, but you don\u2019t have to be Twitter\u2019s Dutch fitness maven Raymond Verheijen to wonder whether Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s summer of sweat may have been counterproductive.</p> <p>The squad Solskj\u00e6r inherited from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho ran less on average than any other in the Premier League. That\u2019s not necessarily to say it was unfit, more that Mourinho\u2019s aversion to pressing meant running was far less important to his side than it is for many others.</p> <p>Solskj\u00e6r then tried to implement a running game and for almost three glorious months it worked, bringing 14 wins in 17 games. Then fatigue set in, injuries mounted and United won just two of their last 12 games of last season. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/06/paris-saint-germain-manchester-united-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">3-1 victory at Paris Saint-Germain</a> in the Champions League now represents a cliff edge.</p> <p>That\u2019s the generous explanation, and it was one the club were keen to push through summer tours, in which all anybody seemed to talk about was how hard they were working. There is probably some truth to that theory but, as with everything else at United these days, it raises more questions than it answers.</p> <p>First, the issue of why the injuries have recurred. Perhaps United overdid it in the summer or, as was suggested last week, day-to-day training is in some way flawed. It may simply be misfortune but the point is wider than the injuries: there can be no confidence now in United\u2019s structures. There was much sneering when Manchester City, on dismissing Roberto Mancini in 2013, spoke of the need for a \u201cholistic\u201d approach, but United now is what happens when there is nothing holistic about a club beyond the general atmosphere of decline. What does it say about planning at the club if they replace one manager with another whose style is so different that players get injured trying to keep up?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b94f29e479ef01ffaee2bbfbfc3e3e614866c2cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b94f29e479ef01ffaee2bbfbfc3e3e614866c2cc/0_27_2938_1764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Pogba, Manchester United\u2019s one outfield player of outstanding quality, spent the summer trying to leave.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Pogba, Manchester United\u2019s one outfield player of outstanding quality, spent the summer trying to leave.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In that sense, Solskj\u00e6r can be portrayed as a patsy. It increasingly appears that his early success lay less in his being Solskj\u00e6r than in his being not\u2011Mourinho, while his appointment was characteristic of a leadership that blows with the wind, pursuing short-term popularity without any grand plan. But it may be that a squad this piecemeal, patched together from the remnants of four very different managers\u2019 inclinations under a board that has demonstrated little in the way of football expertise, makes the act of management almost impossible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/27/manchester-united-pressure-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-positive\">\u2018I never said it was going be easy\u2019: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is staying positive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ed Woodward, United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, has insisted patience will be shown towards Solskj\u00e6r. That makes sense in as much as the manager doesn\u2019t seem the biggest problem at the club. Paul Scholes has suggested that it will take \u201cfour or five\u201d transfer windows to make United competitive again, but why would a leadership that has presided over such decay for the past six years suddenly be able to put it right in two?</p> <p>At the investors\u2019 conference call this past week, shareholders raised only two questions with the CEO: about how the loan system works and about expansion in China, where the club\u2019s app is now producing country-specific content. As an indication of the lack of football expertise and where the club\u2019s priorities lie, it was exemplary. But this cannot endure.</p> <p>Prolonged exile from the Champions League will surely dull the lustre even of Manchester United. All those noodle partners and official lubricants presumably didn\u2019t sign up to be associated with scraps for Europa League qualification.</p> <p>For Woodward and United, far more serious questions are coming.</p>",

But he is 21, came into the Swansea side only last season and had never played a Premier League game before August. He is somebody to be bedded in slowly, to be given time to develop. He should not be United\u2019s main creative threat and it\u2019s unfair to saddle him with that burden. It\u2019s true in part that James has been thrust front and centre by injuries but that itself only raises further questions. How have United ended up with a squad so imbalanced that a couple of absentees can have such a profound impact? And just why have United already suffered so many noncontact injuries this season? Bad luck can happen, of course, but you don\u2019t have to be Twitter\u2019s Dutch fitness maven Raymond Verheijen to wonder whether Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s summer of sweat may have been counterproductive. The squad Solskj\u00e6r inherited from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho ran less on average than any other in the Premier League. That\u2019s not necessarily to say it was unfit, more that Mourinho\u2019s aversion to pressing meant running was far less important to his side than it is for many others. Solskj\u00e6r then tried to implement a running game and for almost three glorious months it worked, bringing 14 wins in 17 games. Then fatigue set in, injuries mounted and United won just two of their last 12 games of last season. The 3-1 victory at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League now represents a cliff edge. That\u2019s the generous explanation, and it was one the club were keen to push through summer tours, in which all anybody seemed to talk about was how hard they were working. There is probably some truth to that theory but, as with everything else at United these days, it raises more questions than it answers. First, the issue of why the injuries have recurred. Perhaps United overdid it in the summer or, as was suggested last week, day-to-day training is in some way flawed. It may simply be misfortune but the point is wider than the injuries: there can be no confidence now in United\u2019s structures. There was much sneering when Manchester City, on dismissing Roberto Mancini in 2013, spoke of the need for a \u201cholistic\u201d approach, but United now is what happens when there is nothing holistic about a club beyond the general atmosphere of decline. What does it say about planning at the club if they replace one manager with another whose style is so different that players get injured trying to keep up? In that sense, Solskj\u00e6r can be portrayed as a patsy. It increasingly appears that his early success lay less in his being Solskj\u00e6r than in his being not\u2011Mourinho, while his appointment was characteristic of a leadership that blows with the wind, pursuing short-term popularity without any grand plan. But it may be that a squad this piecemeal, patched together from the remnants of four very different managers\u2019 inclinations under a board that has demonstrated little in the way of football expertise, makes the act of management almost impossible. Ed Woodward, United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, has insisted patience will be shown towards Solskj\u00e6r. That makes sense in as much as the manager doesn\u2019t seem the biggest problem at the club. Paul Scholes has suggested that it will take \u201cfour or five\u201d transfer windows to make United competitive again, but why would a leadership that has presided over such decay for the past six years suddenly be able to put it right in two? At the investors\u2019 conference call this past week, shareholders raised only two questions with the CEO: about how the loan system works and about expansion in China, where the club\u2019s app is now producing country-specific content. As an indication of the lack of football expertise and where the club\u2019s priorities lie, it was exemplary. But this cannot endure. Prolonged exile from the Champions League will surely dull the lustre even of Manchester United. All those noodle partners and official lubricants presumably didn\u2019t sign up to be associated with scraps for Europa League qualification. For Woodward and United, far more serious questions are coming.",

These guys are brawling in every corner of the ring and giving no quarter! Shots to the head and body. Porter catches Spence with a loaded right hand midway through the 12th that might have hurt Spence, but he looks like he\u2019s taken it OK. Porter continues to press the action, outthrowing and outlanding Spence it seems, though Spence is landing plenty of shots as his opponent lunges in. There\u2019s the bell and we\u2019ll wait on the official cards.

More two-way action from these warriors, both giving as good as they\u2019re getting. And now Porter goes down! It was a left hand smack on the chin that landed right as Porter was throwing a punch in the final minute! A beautifully thrown punch. Porter beats the count and he\u2019s flailing into the emergency, throwing everything he\u2019s got. But it\u2019s too late in the frame to steal the round back. That might be the difference ... but it sets the table for what should be a cracker of a 12th!</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 10-8 Porter (Spence 105-103 Porter)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d903bd48f08fbb0c171d6aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T05:06:34.678Z\">6.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 10</strong></p> <p>War! Both guys continue to let their hands go, trading heavy-handed shots on the inside. For three straight minutes. It\u2019s too much to give you the blow by blow. Suffice it to say both are giving as good as they\u2019re getting and it\u2019s another too close to call. Spence just barely edges it on my card but it\u2019s yet another razor-thin choice. Spence has a cut on the corner of his left eye, the first cut of his professional career (but it appears to have come from a head butt). Both men are in truly extraordinary shape; it\u2019s unbelievable they\u2019ve been able to sustain this pace. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 10-9 Porter (Spence 95-95 Porter)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d903a928f084ab84172f244\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T05:01:35.429Z\">6.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 9</strong></p> <p>Porter is landing the bigger shots early in the eighth, including a flush uppercut that knocks Spence\u2019s sweat into the front row. Porter is keeping this pace up somehow. He\u2019s alternating to the head and body, but Spence is right there firing back. Neither guy is giving an inch. This is some fight, truly. Now Spence is opening up with a devastating left-right combination to the head. How is Porter still upright? Porter just relentless and might have won that round on volume, but Spence landed enough stinging shots in the final round to nick it on my card. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 10-9 Porter (Spence 85-86 Porter)</strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9039a08f084ab84172f23b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T04:57:09.350Z\">5.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 8</strong></p> <p>Spence\u2019s face looking more marked up than we\u2019ve ever seen. Spence lands a big left hand that moves Porter backward. Porter deals with it like he\u2019s dealt with every problem so far: throwing back with abandon. Spence is still trying to set traps but Porter can\u2019t even let him get the bait down. Crunching right hand by Spence upstairs. Spence then triples up a jab out of the exchange and follows up with a left, but Porter rolls out of it and lands a heavy right. This is wild! Another difficult round to call! I\u2019ve got to give it to Porter, who seems to be outhustling and outworking the cool-tempered champion before him. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 9-10 Porter (Spence 75-77 Porter)</strong><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T04:57:25.532Z\">at 5.57am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d90389d8f084ab84172f237\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T04:52:51.700Z\">5.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 7</strong></p> <p>The punch stats indicate Spence is outlanding Porter to the body by a nearly three-to-one margin, but Porter is certainly landing the flashier shots. Spence is fighting Porter\u2019s fight. Wildly exciting, really. And no idea where this one is headed. Both men look fresh midway through the seventh, which has been a bit of a slower frame for both. Yet it\u2019s Porter who has thrown and landed more. Spence continues to hit Porter right on the beltline with the body shots, but Porter\u2019s trucks do seem to be riding a bit high. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 9-10 Porter (Spence 66-67 Porter)</strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9037928f081108db9beb8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T04:48:34.045Z\">5.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 6</strong></p> <p>Spence is picking up the pace early in the sixth, getting Porter up against the ropes and opening up to the head and body. Another warning for Spence from referee Jack Reiss, this time for coming over Porter\u2019s back on the clinch. Spence is landing one body shot after another. These must be taking their toll on Porter, who can\u2019t possibly sustain the frenetic pace he established early over 12 rounds. Two minutes in and this is a Spence round. Porter slips inside and lands a nice right hand. Spence just a little more accurate as I see it. I\u2019ll give it to him which brings it to three-all on my card, but at least four of the six have been too close to call. The official cards could be all over the map. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 10-9 Porter (Spence 57-57 Porter)</strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9036928f084ab84172f235\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T04:44:24.518Z\">5.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 5</strong></p> <p>Spence doing better here in the fifth as Porter\u2019s activity has slowed just slightly. Man, Porter is really going for it tonight. The 31-year-old is swarming into the pocket and letting his hands go with abandon, refusing to let Spence sit back and pick him apart with the surgical precision that\u2019s been his calling card. Head-body combination by Porter! But Spence is landing his shots: a crisp left, then another. Another close round but this one to Spence.</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 10-9 Porter (Spence 47-48 Porter)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d90359c8f081108db9beb87\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T04:40:59.411Z\">5.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 4</strong></p> <p>Porter is landing more hard shots on Spence early in the fourth, both to the head and body. Porter lands another two shots flush on Spence and he\u2019s backed him up against the ropes! What an effort by Porter tonight. Another big left hook by Porter on Spence\u2019s temple and he\u2019s really beating up on the favorite! This is being fought at Porter\u2019s preferred distance and pace and he\u2019s reaping the rewards. Spence landing as well, doing great work to the body that might not be getting the attention of the crowd or the judges. Spence is sitting on that counter but he hasn\u2019t found a place to detonate it yet due to Porter\u2019s relentless activity. Porter landed 26 punches in that round according to the punch statistics, which is the most ever landed on Spence in a round.</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 9-10 Porter (Spence 37-39 Porter)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9034b58f084ab84172f22e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T04:36:22.404Z\">5.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 3</strong></p> <p>Porter is throwing far more punches and punches in combination, but Spence lands the first good blow of the third with a left to the body. A very nice right to the head upstairs by Spence, followed by a pair of punishing body shots by Spence which are really straying near to if now below the beltline. An all-out action fight, really! Both fighters are really letting their hands go! Now the referee has stopped the action to warn Spence about hitting below the belt. Porter backs up Spence with a combo! Another close round to call, this time due to an excess of two-way action, but we\u2019ll give it to Porter. Very fun fight!</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 9-10 Porter (Spence 28-29 Porter)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9033988f081108db9beb83\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T04:31:48.741Z\">5.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 2</strong></p> <p>A crisp counter left by Spence early in the second, but Porter comes back immediately with a shot of his own. A sharp left-hand lead by Spence catches his opponent right on the jaw. Porter catches Spence off balance with a right hand upstairs which sends the Texan sprawling back: it looks worse than it was. Porter is lunging forward with shots upstairs, really letting his hands go. He\u2019s the busier fighter. Spence far more measured and judicious. Must say Porter may be getting the attention of the judges in this round and the first based on activity, regardless of whether the punches are landing. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 9-10 Porter (Spence 19-19 Porter)</strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9032c68f084ab84172f228\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T04:27:59.701Z\">5.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 1</strong></p> <p>And we\u2019re off! The fighters circle each other in the center of the ring trading quick probing jabs. Spence holding his ground, Porter darting in and out bouncing on his heels. Porter giving a bit of ground allowing Spence to come forward. Interesting chess match in the opening 90 seconds despite no substantial punces landed. Spence remaining in the pocket as Porter keeps darting around remaining an elusive target. A couple of nice body shots by Spence with about a half-minute to go. A very difficult round to score due to the paucity of landed shots, but I\u2019ll nick it to Spence based on his body work.</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 10-9 Porter (Spence 10-9 Porter)</strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9031068f084ab84172f226\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T04:21:03.159Z\">5.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u2019s ringwalk time! </strong>Shawn Porter makes his way from the tunnel first clad in a thousand-studded gold vest and his familiar megawatt smile.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check out the full fight report below. The ringside judges have given their scores: 116-111 to Spence, 115-112 to Porter ... and 116-111 to Spence! Errol Spence Jr has unified the IBF and WBC welterweight titles by a split decision. Round 12 More of the same! These guys are brawling in every corner of the ring and giving no quarter! Shots to the head and body. Porter catches Spence with a loaded right hand midway through the 12th that might have hurt Spence, but he looks like he\u2019s taken it OK. Porter continues to press the action, outthrowing and outlanding Spence it seems, though Spence is landing plenty of shots as his opponent lunges in. There\u2019s the bell and we\u2019ll wait on the official cards. By our unofficial tally, Spence\u2019s knockdown was the difference. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 9-10 Porter (Spence 114-113 Porter) Round 11 Spence lands a crisp right hook early in the round when Porter falls off balance. More two-way action from these warriors, both giving as good as they\u2019re getting. And now Porter goes down! It was a left hand smack on the chin that landed right as Porter was throwing a punch in the final minute! A beautifully thrown punch. Porter beats the count and he\u2019s flailing into the emergency, throwing everything he\u2019s got. But it\u2019s too late in the frame to steal the round back. That might be the difference ... but it sets the table for what should be a cracker of a 12th! Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 10-8 Porter (Spence 105-103 Porter) Round 10 War! Both guys continue to let their hands go, trading heavy-handed shots on the inside. For three straight minutes. It\u2019s too much to give you the blow by blow. Suffice it to say both are giving as good as they\u2019re getting and it\u2019s another too close to call. Spence just barely edges it on my card but it\u2019s yet another razor-thin choice. Spence has a cut on the corner of his left eye, the first cut of his professional career (but it appears to have come from a head butt). Both men are in truly extraordinary shape; it\u2019s unbelievable they\u2019ve been able to sustain this pace. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 10-9 Porter (Spence 95-95 Porter) Round 9 Porter is landing the bigger shots early in the eighth, including a flush uppercut that knocks Spence\u2019s sweat into the front row. Porter is keeping this pace up somehow. He\u2019s alternating to the head and body, but Spence is right there firing back. Neither guy is giving an inch. This is some fight, truly. Now Spence is opening up with a devastating left-right combination to the head. How is Porter still upright? Porter just relentless and might have won that round on volume, but Spence landed enough stinging shots in the final round to nick it on my card. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 10-9 Porter (Spence 85-86 Porter) Round 8 Spence\u2019s face looking more marked up than we\u2019ve ever seen. Spence lands a big left hand that moves Porter backward. Porter deals with it like he\u2019s dealt with every problem so far: throwing back with abandon. Spence is still trying to set traps but Porter can\u2019t even let him get the bait down. Crunching right hand by Spence upstairs. Spence then triples up a jab out of the exchange and follows up with a left, but Porter rolls out of it and lands a heavy right. This is wild! Another difficult round to call! I\u2019ve got to give it to Porter, who seems to be outhustling and outworking the cool-tempered champion before him. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 9-10 Porter (Spence 75-77 Porter) Round 7 The punch stats indicate Spence is outlanding Porter to the body by a nearly three-to-one margin, but Porter is certainly landing the flashier shots. Spence is fighting Porter\u2019s fight. Wildly exciting, really. And no idea where this one is headed. Both men look fresh midway through the seventh, which has been a bit of a slower frame for both. Yet it\u2019s Porter who has thrown and landed more. Spence continues to hit Porter right on the beltline with the body shots, but Porter\u2019s trucks do seem to be riding a bit high. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 9-10 Porter (Spence 66-67 Porter) Round 6 Spence is picking up the pace early in the sixth, getting Porter up against the ropes and opening up to the head and body. Another warning for Spence from referee Jack Reiss, this time for coming over Porter\u2019s back on the clinch. Spence is landing one body shot after another. These must be taking their toll on Porter, who can\u2019t possibly sustain the frenetic pace he established early over 12 rounds. Two minutes in and this is a Spence round. Porter slips inside and lands a nice right hand. Spence just a little more accurate as I see it. I\u2019ll give it to him which brings it to three-all on my card, but at least four of the six have been too close to call. The official cards could be all over the map. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 10-9 Porter (Spence 57-57 Porter) Round 5 Spence doing better here in the fifth as Porter\u2019s activity has slowed just slightly. Man, Porter is really going for it tonight. The 31-year-old is swarming into the pocket and letting his hands go with abandon, refusing to let Spence sit back and pick him apart with the surgical precision that\u2019s been his calling card. Head-body combination by Porter! But Spence is landing his shots: a crisp left, then another. Another close round but this one to Spence. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 10-9 Porter (Spence 47-48 Porter) Round 4 Porter is landing more hard shots on Spence early in the fourth, both to the head and body. Porter lands another two shots flush on Spence and he\u2019s backed him up against the ropes! What an effort by Porter tonight. Another big left hook by Porter on Spence\u2019s temple and he\u2019s really beating up on the favorite! This is being fought at Porter\u2019s preferred distance and pace and he\u2019s reaping the rewards. Spence landing as well, doing great work to the body that might not be getting the attention of the crowd or the judges. Spence is sitting on that counter but he hasn\u2019t found a place to detonate it yet due to Porter\u2019s relentless activity. Porter landed 26 punches in that round according to the punch statistics, which is the most ever landed on Spence in a round. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 9-10 Porter (Spence 37-39 Porter) Round 3 Porter is throwing far more punches and punches in combination, but Spence lands the first good blow of the third with a left to the body. A very nice right to the head upstairs by Spence, followed by a pair of punishing body shots by Spence which are really straying near to if now below the beltline. An all-out action fight, really! Both fighters are really letting their hands go! Now the referee has stopped the action to warn Spence about hitting below the belt. Porter backs up Spence with a combo! Another close round to call, this time due to an excess of two-way action, but we\u2019ll give it to Porter. Very fun fight! Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 9-10 Porter (Spence 28-29 Porter) Round 2 A crisp counter left by Spence early in the second, but Porter comes back immediately with a shot of his own. A sharp left-hand lead by Spence catches his opponent right on the jaw. Porter catches Spence off balance with a right hand upstairs which sends the Texan sprawling back: it looks worse than it was. Porter is lunging forward with shots upstairs, really letting his hands go. He\u2019s the busier fighter. Spence far more measured and judicious. Must say Porter may be getting the attention of the judges in this round and the first based on activity, regardless of whether the punches are landing. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 9-10 Porter (Spence 19-19 Porter) Round 1 And we\u2019re off! The fighters circle each other in the center of the ring trading quick probing jabs. Spence holding his ground, Porter darting in and out bouncing on his heels. Porter giving a bit of ground allowing Spence to come forward. Interesting chess match in the opening 90 seconds despite no substantial punces landed. Spence remaining in the pocket as Porter keeps darting around remaining an elusive target. A couple of nice body shots by Spence with about a half-minute to go. A very difficult round to score due to the paucity of landed shots, but I\u2019ll nick it to Spence based on his body work. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Spence 10-9 Porter (Spence 10-9 Porter) It\u2019s ringwalk time! Shawn Porter makes his way from the tunnel first clad in a thousand-studded gold vest and his familiar megawatt smile. Now it\u2019s Shawn Porter, who makes the long walk to the geographically appropriate LA by Trapboy Freddy in a black and silver robe. Jimmy Lennon Jr takes the microphone and we\u2019re into the announcements. David Benavidez has just stopped Anthony Dirrell in the ninth round to regain the WBC super middleweight title. Dirrell suffered a terribly unlucky cut midway through the fight before a slow-starting Benavidez closed the show. The undefeated 22-year-old from Phoenix is immediately touted as one of the youngest ever two-time champions at 168lbs, an interesting flex considering he was stripped of his title the first time after testing positive for cocaine, but OK. Now it\u2019s time for the main event with Spence and Porter set to make their ringwalks in the next 10 minutes or so. Here\u2019s a look at how Spence and Porter match up ahead of tonight\u2019s main event. Porter is roughly a 6-1 underdog in the contest, a number that\u2019s less a slight to his standing as a two-time welterweight champion and more a nod to Spence, who just may be the finest boxer in the world today, pound for pound. Hello and welcome to Los Angeles for tonight\u2019s welterweight unification title fight between Errol Spence Jr and Shawn Porter. Spence, who\u2019s owned the IBF\u2019s version of the 147lbs championship for the last two years, and Porter, who holds the WBC strap, are set to meet at Staples Center to unify two of the four major belts and set the table for even bigger blockbusters in what\u2019s been boxing\u2019s showcase division for the last decade or more. Right now we\u2019re two fights into tonight\u2019s three-fight pay-per-view undercard. In the opener, Josesito Lopez dropped John Molina Jr twice before stopping him in the eighth round of a scheduled 10-round welterweight bout. And moments ago Mario Barrios outpointed Batyr Akhmedov for the WBA\u2019s vacant regular super lightweight title, whatever that is, coming on strong in the second half of the fight to win by scores of 114-112, 115-111 and 116-111. That leaves one more prelim before the main event with Anthony Dirrell defending his WBC super middleweight title against David Benavidez, meaning Spence and Porter should walk about an hour from right now, give or take. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s column on Nigel Benn\u2019s surprise comeback.",

Hoteliers have to be compensated, probably to the tune of tens of millions of pounds. And the biggest cost involves refunding customers for future bookings. The whole bundle could run to \u00a3500m. The travel industry has an insurance scheme, but taxpayers could still be on the hook for a shortfall.</p> <p>Consideration must also be given to the pain caused to employees and customers. On social media, you can find desperate former Thomas Cook airline crew and branch staff appealing for new employment opportunities. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/21/thomas-cook-planes-put-on-standby-to-rescue-travellers-as-talks-go-to-wire\" title=\"\">Operation Matterhorn</a>, the Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s repatriation effort, has been slick but holidaymakers have nonetheless suffered stress and disruption.</p> <p>Should the government have saved Thomas Cook instead? No. That argument was aired immediately after the company\u2019s collapse but its credibility has weakened by the day.</p> <p>Thomas Cook was in an ugly financial state. Even a \u00a3200m contribution from public coffers to a wider creditor-led \u00a31.1bn restructuring plan might not have been enough. The high court witness statement from the company\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, described a balance sheet deficit of \u00a33.1bn. Frankly, Wrightbus, the Ballymena-based Routemaster bus company that was last week\u2019s other major corporate collapse, had a better claim for public rescue \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/25/wrightbus-goes-into-administration-1400-jobs-routemaster-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">it wasn\u2019t saved</a>.</p> <p>Postmortems on Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse, however, are essential. The Insolvency Service and the Financial Reporting Council will do their work but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/26/mps-announce-inquiry-thomas-cook-collapse\" title=\"\">the inquiry by the business select committee</a>, chaired by the Labour MP Rachel Reeves, will be the first step.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Shareholders would not have cheered a rights issue but the job of directors is to take the long view</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reeves should not be too obsessed with her idea that the downfall of Thomas Cook \u201cappears to be a sorry tale of corporate greed\u201d. Yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/23/hedge-funds-win-big-from-short-selling-thomas-cook-shares\" title=\"\">\u00a335m in pay over 12 years for the past three chief executives</a> looks appalling, but treat the numbers with care. Of Fankhauser\u2019s notional \u00a38.4m haul, about \u00a34m seems to have been in the form of shares he held until they became worthless.</p> <p>Incompetence and hubris in the boardroom look to be the direct causes. Fankhauser, in post for four years, and Frank Meysman, chairman since 2011, must explain why they didn\u2019t fix a fragile balance sheet when it seemed possible.</p> <p>The stock market valued Thomas Cook\u2019s equity at \u00a32bn as late as May 2018. Shareholders would not have cheered a rights issue to raise, say, \u00a3500m at that point, but the job of directors is to take the long view. Fankhauser and Meysman could have pitched a reasonable argument along these lines: repay some debt, lower the interest costs and allow more investment in new, company-owned hotels, the focus of the turnaround strategy.</p> <p>In November 2017 in the annual report, Meysman wrote that \u201ca highly competitive environment ... has contributed to the collapse of a number of competitors in the last 12 months\u201d, so he was clearly aware of the external risks. Given that Thomas Cook itself almost failed in 2011, reducing debt should have been the absolute priority. The most astonishing statistic in the whole saga is that the company paid \u00a31.2bn in interest charges after 2010.</p> <p>As for the accounting angle, Reeves\u2019s committee must ask why Thomas Cook recorded so many one-off charges and \u201cseparately disclosed items\u201d over the years. The company was in restructuring mode, so heavy use of exceptional items is not unusual, but EY, after it took over from PwC as auditor in 2017, challenged some of the treatments.

      "bodyText": "Almost a week after the collapse of Thomas Cook, the cost of failure looks as severe as feared. Repatriating 150,000 holidaymakers could mean a bill of \u00a3100m. Hoteliers have to be compensated, probably to the tune of tens of millions of pounds. And the biggest cost involves refunding customers for future bookings. The whole bundle could run to \u00a3500m. The travel industry has an insurance scheme, but taxpayers could still be on the hook for a shortfall. Consideration must also be given to the pain caused to employees and customers. On social media, you can find desperate former Thomas Cook airline crew and branch staff appealing for new employment opportunities. Operation Matterhorn, the Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s repatriation effort, has been slick but holidaymakers have nonetheless suffered stress and disruption. Should the government have saved Thomas Cook instead? No. That argument was aired immediately after the company\u2019s collapse but its credibility has weakened by the day. Thomas Cook was in an ugly financial state. Even a \u00a3200m contribution from public coffers to a wider creditor-led \u00a31.1bn restructuring plan might not have been enough. The high court witness statement from the company\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, described a balance sheet deficit of \u00a33.1bn. Frankly, Wrightbus, the Ballymena-based Routemaster bus company that was last week\u2019s other major corporate collapse, had a better claim for public rescue \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t saved. Postmortems on Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse, however, are essential. The Insolvency Service and the Financial Reporting Council will do their work but the inquiry by the business select committee, chaired by the Labour MP Rachel Reeves, will be the first step. Reeves should not be too obsessed with her idea that the downfall of Thomas Cook \u201cappears to be a sorry tale of corporate greed\u201d. Yes, \u00a335m in pay over 12 years for the past three chief executives looks appalling, but treat the numbers with care. Of Fankhauser\u2019s notional \u00a38.4m haul, about \u00a34m seems to have been in the form of shares he held until they became worthless. Incompetence and hubris in the boardroom look to be the direct causes. Fankhauser, in post for four years, and Frank Meysman, chairman since 2011, must explain why they didn\u2019t fix a fragile balance sheet when it seemed possible. The stock market valued Thomas Cook\u2019s equity at \u00a32bn as late as May 2018. Shareholders would not have cheered a rights issue to raise, say, \u00a3500m at that point, but the job of directors is to take the long view. Fankhauser and Meysman could have pitched a reasonable argument along these lines: repay some debt, lower the interest costs and allow more investment in new, company-owned hotels, the focus of the turnaround strategy. In November 2017 in the annual report, Meysman wrote that \u201ca highly competitive environment ... has contributed to the collapse of a number of competitors in the last 12 months\u201d, so he was clearly aware of the external risks. Given that Thomas Cook itself almost failed in 2011, reducing debt should have been the absolute priority. The most astonishing statistic in the whole saga is that the company paid \u00a31.2bn in interest charges after 2010. As for the accounting angle, Reeves\u2019s committee must ask why Thomas Cook recorded so many one-off charges and \u201cseparately disclosed items\u201d over the years. The company was in restructuring mode, so heavy use of exceptional items is not unusual, but EY, after it took over from PwC as auditor in 2017, challenged some of the treatments. Why hadn\u2019t the company\u2019s own audit committee done so previously? There must also be an explanation of why a \u00a31.1bn goodwill writedown on the purchase of MyTravel appeared in the interim results only this year \u2013 the acquisition itself happened in 2007. Fankhauser and Meysman, no doubt, will issue grovelling apologies to the committee. That\u2019s the usual form for directors who have failed. It\u2019s an explanation for their actions, though, that former employees deserve to hear. If recession is looming, governments must start spending now The economic optimists reject the suggestion from the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development that everyone should prepare for a global recession, arguing that these institutions missed the last financial crash and are desperate to avoid a repeat of their mistake, even if it means forecasting the next one many years before it actually happens. In her first public statement after being confirmed as the new head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva said last week that the global economy needed to be ready to cope with a fresh economic downturn. The week before, the OECD\u2019s chief economist, Laurence Boone, was notably downbeat, citing the chilling effect of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China and the uncertainty created by Brexit as reasons to be gloomy. The main message from both organisations was directed at governments, which they believe must be prepared to step up their spending now that the private sector has seen the warning signs of recession and stopped investing. The last time the global economy dealt with a shock, governments played a part in the rescue. That was in the days when leaders such as Gordon Brown could command the attention of his peers in arguing for a comprehensive and costly lifeboat. Then, after the 2008 crash, the job of rebuilding crisis-hit economies was left to central banks. Hence the era of ultra-low interest rates. The justified fear is that the next crisis will be characterised by governments pleading poverty to justify inaction. Either they will argue they are bereft of the necessary funds or that borrowing is already too high. Georgieva knows central banks have little firepower left after a decade of providing cheap money, which is why she is right to call on governments to open their wallets now, and not wait until it\u2019s too late. EDF is well insulated from cost of nuclear power The UK\u2019s first new nuclear plant in a generation was once expected to cost \u00a312bn. Today, Hinkley Point in Somerset is expected to cost almost double that, and there is no guarantee costs won\u2019t continue to climb. The latest estimate revealed last week by French energy group EDF piled an extra \u00a32.9bn on to the cost of the project, which could reach \u00a322.5bn by the time it begins powering British homes in 2025. EDF delivered the news with a shrug. After all, it is not the first time the French nuclear giant has admitted that work on the Somerset site will cost more and take longer than it first hoped. And it won\u2019t \u201cadd a penny\u201d to home energy bills, it said. But the cost increase raises difficult questions over the government\u2019s plan to support another of EDF\u2019s nuclear projects, at Sizewell in Suffolk, by putting the taxpayer on the hook for cost overruns. The government argues that a funding model which shares the financial risk between EDF and British energy consumers would lower the overall energy cost.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has set out plans for 40 new hospitals as the Tories prepare to make the NHS a key battleground in the next general election. The prime minister heads into a Conservative party conference fighting battles on several fronts, including more claims about his association with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri. On Saturday, Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, accused him of whipping up fears of rioting and deaths on the streets if Brexit is not delivered by 31 October so he could seek to invoke emergency powers and avoid extending the UK\u2019s EU membership beyond that date. With the conference opening in Manchester on Sunday, Johnson said the government was embarking on \u201cthe biggest hospital building programme in a generation\u201d. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, he said spending on the NHS was \u201cabsolutely central\u201d to his vision of a \u201cunited society and a united country\u201d. Under the plans drawn up by health secretary Matt Hancock, he said they would be spending \u00a313bn on what officials described as \u201cnew\u201d hospitals; either with entirely new buildings or gutting existing structures to create state-of-the-art facilities. Taken alongside the extra \u00a333.9bn the government has committed to the NHS each year by 2023, he claimed it was \u201cthe largest sum that has ever been invested in the NHS\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re launching the biggest hospital building programme in a generation.

It\u2019s the biggest programme of hospital building in a generation.\u201d On Friday, the prime minister was referred to the police complaints body to assess whether he should face a criminal investigation over his links to entrepreneur Arcuri. Arcuri loaned more than \u00a3700,000 to her own fledgling technology company shortly before it won a \u00a3100,000 government grant. It is unclear where the money channelled to Hacker House, a start-up with hardly any income, came from. Johnson has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to his links to Arcuri. Announcing his hospitals plan, Johnson said it would begin with a \u00a32.7bn cash injection for six hospitals over the next five years. The remaining projects, including up to a dozen smaller rural hospitals, would be completed over the second half of the next decade. Ministers are also providing \u00a3100m in \u201cseed funding\u201d to help 21 trusts develop plans to rebuild or construct 34 hospitals, including up to a dozen community hospitals in Dorset. Following the supreme court ruling his suspension of Parliament was unlawful, the prime minister offered support for a suggestion by attorney general Geoffrey Cox that in future justices may need to undergo a US-style vetting by politicians. \u201cI think, if judges are to pronounce on political questions in this way, then there is at least an argument that there should be some form of accountability,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lessons of America are relevant.\u201d Johnson arrived in Manchester for a conference which faces being overshadowed by moves to oust him at Westminster.

      "body": "<p>Deep in the night of 29 January 2012, Fatih Ozcan had an unusual dream. Then 27, and a waiter in a Turkish restaurant in York, Ozcan dreamed he was holding \u201cloads of cash\u201d while standing in front of his boss. When he arrived at the restaurant for his 5pm shift the next day, he was impatient to speak with his employer. \u201cI was saying: \u2018Where is he? I need him.\u2019 I was telling everyone I had to play the lottery with the boss,\u201d Ozcan says. After two hours of pestering, Ozcan\u2019s boss agreed to play. Two days later, the winning EuroMillions numbers were drawn \u2013 the pair won \u00a31m.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had loads of dreams that have become true, but they were little things, like travelling somewhere or having a nice day,\u201d he says. Ozcan was certain this dream was prophetic and that he and his boss would win money together, because a month earlier he prayed for wealth for the first time. \u201cMy boss and my colleagues didn\u2019t believe it, but I believed it and that\u2019s why I pressured him for hours.\u201d</p> <p>Every month premonitions hit the headlines \u2013 from the (ironically predictable) claims of Uri Geller to the countless celebrities who claim they foresaw 9/11 (including Michael Caine, Christine Lampard and Richard Madeley).

It takes him an hour to gather information.

He assesses \u201csignals\u201d from his team of precog \u201cviewers\u201d in conjunction with traditional market analysis. \u201cIf eight people say the markets are going to go up and two people say the market is going to go down, you make a decision based on both experience and intuition.\u201d His clients include inventors, stakeholders and entrepreneurs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been extremely helpful for me,\u201d says Andrea Driver, a 50-year-old from Sacramento who has been using Soul Rider\u2019s services for a year. Earlier this year, Austin advised her against purchasing a piece of land for her business \u2013 it later emerged there were permit issues with the location. \u201cHaving him tapping into that, precogging that, was very helpful.\u201d It is easy to be sceptical of psychic claims. At one point during our call, Austin says he has \u201ca feeling there\u2019s a reason you opted to write this story\u201d. </p> <p>Er, yes, I say sheepishly, I was commissioned by an editor.</p> <p>Both Austin and Smith also say they don\u2019t want to use their powers to become millionaires themselves. Yet Caroline Watt, a parapsychologist at the University of Edinburgh, says studies have found a \u201csmall\u201d but \u201cstatistically significant\u201d precognitive effect in humans. \u201cI know that sceptical scientists would argue it is not possible to look into the future, therefore it is obviously nonsense when a study claims a positive effect,\u201d she says. However, Watt says there are some well-controlled studies that are hard to explain. She cites a 1989 meta-analysis of 309 \u201cfuture-telling\u201d studies conducted on 50,000 subjects between 1935 and 1987. The analysis concluded that \u201cevidence for an overall effect is strong.\u201d In 2016, researchers from the University of New South Wales found that \u201cnon-conscious emotional information\u201d enables us to make better decisions \u2013 in short, intuition exists. If it\u2019s accepted we subconsciously gather hidden information from our surroundings, is precognition a possibility?</p> <p>Despite this evidence, Watt warns that people shouldn\u2019t put much stock (or shares) in the precog economy. \u201cI would say it is a form of gambling because, although there may be a tiny effect, it\u2019s not something of much practical use. The odds might be 1 in 1,000. I wouldn\u2019t bet my house or my health on that.\u201d</p> <p>Mossbridge is an optimist. While she agrees with Watt\u2019s \u201csmall but statistically significant\u201d framing, she believes further research is needed. \u201cScientists never used to be able to study meditation, because it was seen as too \u2018woo woo\u2019, but then people meditated and reduced stress, so now studies get funded,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it always works \u2013 science is the last to jump on the bandwagon.\u201d</p> <p>If science is last, then the military is first. Many precogs don\u2019t just look into the future, Smith and Austin both use a technique known as \u201cremote viewing\u201d to explore distant targets in the present and the past. In 1995, the CIA declassified documents related to a secret army project, Stargate, that spent $20m researching remote viewing for 20 years, from the 1970s onwards. The files concluded that \u201cremote viewers can be used as collectors in conjunction with other intelligence sources\u201d. A major success came in 1976, when a remote viewer named Rosemary Smith found the location of a lost Soviet spy plane (in 1995, former president Jimmy Carter confirmed the incident had taken place). Yet Ray Hyman, a psychology professor tasked by the CIA to evaluate Stargate, wrote of consistent methodological problems, concluding there was little evidence remote viewing worked, let alone that it was useful in intelligence operations.</p> <p><em><strong>Gail Husick, 55,</strong></em> is a former partner in a law firm who founded a remote-viewing agency in Washington in 2014. Among other things, the Husick Group has helped the police with missing-person cases, found a lost passport, searched for stolen art and advised an entrepreneur on technology patents. Fees begin at $3,000.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the information business,\u201d she says, claiming she is not a \u201ctypical\u201d psychic. \u201cI had a pretty traditional education and family background. I went to Harvard Law School, I practised in Silicon Valley.\u201d After experiencing precognitive dreams, Husick trained as a remote viewer \u2013 as part of Stargate, the government funded a project at Stanford Research Institute to create a remote viewing training protocol. Husick compares remote viewing to an aperture opening and closing rapidly, like the flash of images you might get when recalling your childhood bedroom. She gives her viewers a vague instruction, for example, \u201cYour target is a location,\u201d and they get into a meditative state before sketching and jotting down what they see. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like seeing a memory, except it\u2019s just a place you haven\u2019t been before.\u201d As such, Husick warns that remote viewing is \u201calmost never 100% accurate\u201d and is best used alongside other information.</p> <p>Tim O\u2019Brien, 61, is a Microsoft employee from Seattle who was adopted as a child and employed Husick to help find his birth mother. Over several months, Husick produced a 25-page report that O\u2019Brien says gave \u201cvery, very intimate\u201d details about his mother that she later confirmed to be true. O\u2019Brien says these details include the fact that his mother worked in a mercantile environment and is very short, and that O\u2019Brien\u2019s conception was non- consensual and distressing. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that it wasn\u2019t just lucky guessing.\u201d O\u2019Brien found his mother a year after Husick\u2019s report \u2013 but not because of it. \u201cThey tried to pinpoint the town and were inaccurate,\u201d he says, adding this \u201ccaused an unnecessary side-track\u201d in his journey. Yet he has no regrets, and recommends remote viewing to others. \u201cI think it\u2019s a valuable tool.\u201d</p> <p>Husick offers to conduct a remote-viewing session for me. I choose a location \u2013 a small hut-like pagoda on the northwestern corner of Nami Island, a micronation in South Korea where my boyfriend proposed to me earlier this summer.</p> <p>Husick used 13 remote viewers for the task and then sent me her report. I was initially unimpressed by the results. The viewers saw \u201ca curved structure\u201d that resembled a pit or an amphitheatre, there was reference to tiered seating, and Husick\u2019s report mentioned a tunnel, mine, or shaft. \u201cThere is a sense of intense desire, danger, threat, aggression and competition associated with the target location,\u201d the report reads, somewhat insultingly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Those who buy into the precog economy don\u2019t like to publicise the fact \u2013 police forces prefer to keep quiet about it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I tell Husick the viewing failed, she is unperturbed. \u201cI understand your initial reaction. Most people expect us to be like psychics in the movies and the reality is that our work is much more painstaking,\u201d she says. She explores Nami Island on Google and finds several consistencies with the viewers\u2019 visions. She points out that several viewers spoke of a tower-like feature near the target location \u2013 a zipwire runs from the mainland to the island. The report shows that Viewer 12 saw \u201cmultiples of human males rappelling downwards suspended by rope-like cords\u201d. Husick adds that, although I didn\u2019t see it, there is cascaded seating on the island \u2013 in a garden area \u2013 and it\u2019s adorned with flags, just as one viewer drew. She explains that if I were a real client, multiple sessions would have been undertaken, and this report is just a \u201cfirst pass\u201d at the target.</p> <p>Husick considers our session a success; I remain confused. The viewers\u2019 results are over 200 pages long. For every result that makes me gasp (Viewer 12 drew a structure that looks remarkably like my pagoda), another dampens my mood (one viewer saw an \u201cindustrial wasteland\u201d and \u201curban decay\u201d \u2013 the island is lush and green, and peacocks wander freely).</p> <p>Should I put stock in Husick\u2019s consistencies? Professor French says a cognitive bias known as \u201csubjective validation\u201d means people consider information correct if it has personal value to them (he notes that no one is immune and, thanks to his career, he himself has a vested interest in being a sceptic). \u201cHow do we know that those correspondences didn\u2019t just occur by chance? In 200 pages, there\u2019s bound to be elements that match any location you go to,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Yet Mossbridge argues it\u2019s still a growing business. \u201cThere are more and more people who are building applications of this work. Some are legitimate and some are not, but they\u2019re getting customers who are buying their work for reasonable and sometimes exorbitant prices, which means that the sceptics are not winning.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that those who do buy into the precog economy don\u2019t like to publicise the fact. Austin, Husick and Smith all say that police forces who work with them prefer to keep quiet about it, and Austin believes the precog economy will have to stay on the \u201cdownlow\u201d as it expands. \u201cIt scares people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt scares the hell out of them.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Winning the lottery</strong></em> after a precognitive dream was the least remarkable part of Fatih Ozcan\u2019s story. The waiter only found out he\u2019d won nine days after the draw, because his boss kept the ticket and refused to halve the winnings. After protracted police proceedings, Ozcan took him to court. It was a distressing time \u2013 telling the story makes his voice shake. \u201cPeople were telling me I had no chance of winning the court case,\u201d he says. Yet midway through his ordeal, he received reassurance in the middle of the night. \u201cI had another dream showing me I would win the case,\u201d he recalls. After a week-long trial in 2014, a judge ruled that Ozcan should be given his \u00a3500,000 share.</p>",

He assesses \u201csignals\u201d from his team of precog \u201cviewers\u201d in conjunction with traditional market analysis. \u201cIf eight people say the markets are going to go up and two people say the market is going to go down, you make a decision based on both experience and intuition.\u201d His clients include inventors, stakeholders and entrepreneurs. \u201cIt\u2019s been extremely helpful for me,\u201d says Andrea Driver, a 50-year-old from Sacramento who has been using Soul Rider\u2019s services for a year. Earlier this year, Austin advised her against purchasing a piece of land for her business \u2013 it later emerged there were permit issues with the location. \u201cHaving him tapping into that, precogging that, was very helpful.\u201d It is easy to be sceptical of psychic claims. At one point during our call, Austin says he has \u201ca feeling there\u2019s a reason you opted to write this story\u201d. Er, yes, I say sheepishly, I was commissioned by an editor. Both Austin and Smith also say they don\u2019t want to use their powers to become millionaires themselves. Yet Caroline Watt, a parapsychologist at the University of Edinburgh, says studies have found a \u201csmall\u201d but \u201cstatistically significant\u201d precognitive effect in humans. \u201cI know that sceptical scientists would argue it is not possible to look into the future, therefore it is obviously nonsense when a study claims a positive effect,\u201d she says. However, Watt says there are some well-controlled studies that are hard to explain. She cites a 1989 meta-analysis of 309 \u201cfuture-telling\u201d studies conducted on 50,000 subjects between 1935 and 1987. The analysis concluded that \u201cevidence for an overall effect is strong.\u201d In 2016, researchers from the University of New South Wales found that \u201cnon-conscious emotional information\u201d enables us to make better decisions \u2013 in short, intuition exists. If it\u2019s accepted we subconsciously gather hidden information from our surroundings, is precognition a possibility? Despite this evidence, Watt warns that people shouldn\u2019t put much stock (or shares) in the precog economy. \u201cI would say it is a form of gambling because, although there may be a tiny effect, it\u2019s not something of much practical use. The odds might be 1 in 1,000. I wouldn\u2019t bet my house or my health on that.\u201d Mossbridge is an optimist. While she agrees with Watt\u2019s \u201csmall but statistically significant\u201d framing, she believes further research is needed. \u201cScientists never used to be able to study meditation, because it was seen as too \u2018woo woo\u2019, but then people meditated and reduced stress, so now studies get funded,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it always works \u2013 science is the last to jump on the bandwagon.\u201d If science is last, then the military is first. Many precogs don\u2019t just look into the future, Smith and Austin both use a technique known as \u201cremote viewing\u201d to explore distant targets in the present and the past. In 1995, the CIA declassified documents related to a secret army project, Stargate, that spent $20m researching remote viewing for 20 years, from the 1970s onwards. The files concluded that \u201cremote viewers can be used as collectors in conjunction with other intelligence sources\u201d. A major success came in 1976, when a remote viewer named Rosemary Smith found the location of a lost Soviet spy plane (in 1995, former president Jimmy Carter confirmed the incident had taken place). Yet Ray Hyman, a psychology professor tasked by the CIA to evaluate Stargate, wrote of consistent methodological problems, concluding there was little evidence remote viewing worked, let alone that it was useful in intelligence operations. Gail Husick, 55, is a former partner in a law firm who founded a remote-viewing agency in Washington in 2014. Among other things, the Husick Group has helped the police with missing-person cases, found a lost passport, searched for stolen art and advised an entrepreneur on technology patents. Fees begin at $3,000. \u201cWe\u2019re in the information business,\u201d she says, claiming she is not a \u201ctypical\u201d psychic. \u201cI had a pretty traditional education and family background. I went to Harvard Law School, I practised in Silicon Valley.\u201d After experiencing precognitive dreams, Husick trained as a remote viewer \u2013 as part of Stargate, the government funded a project at Stanford Research Institute to create a remote viewing training protocol. Husick compares remote viewing to an aperture opening and closing rapidly, like the flash of images you might get when recalling your childhood bedroom. She gives her viewers a vague instruction, for example, \u201cYour target is a location,\u201d and they get into a meditative state before sketching and jotting down what they see. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like seeing a memory, except it\u2019s just a place you haven\u2019t been before.\u201d As such, Husick warns that remote viewing is \u201calmost never 100% accurate\u201d and is best used alongside other information. Tim O\u2019Brien, 61, is a Microsoft employee from Seattle who was adopted as a child and employed Husick to help find his birth mother. Over several months, Husick produced a 25-page report that O\u2019Brien says gave \u201cvery, very intimate\u201d details about his mother that she later confirmed to be true. O\u2019Brien says these details include the fact that his mother worked in a mercantile environment and is very short, and that O\u2019Brien\u2019s conception was non- consensual and distressing. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that it wasn\u2019t just lucky guessing.\u201d O\u2019Brien found his mother a year after Husick\u2019s report \u2013 but not because of it. \u201cThey tried to pinpoint the town and were inaccurate,\u201d he says, adding this \u201ccaused an unnecessary side-track\u201d in his journey. Yet he has no regrets, and recommends remote viewing to others. \u201cI think it\u2019s a valuable tool.\u201d Husick offers to conduct a remote-viewing session for me. I choose a location \u2013 a small hut-like pagoda on the northwestern corner of Nami Island, a micronation in South Korea where my boyfriend proposed to me earlier this summer. Husick used 13 remote viewers for the task and then sent me her report. I was initially unimpressed by the results. The viewers saw \u201ca curved structure\u201d that resembled a pit or an amphitheatre, there was reference to tiered seating, and Husick\u2019s report mentioned a tunnel, mine, or shaft. \u201cThere is a sense of intense desire, danger, threat, aggression and competition associated with the target location,\u201d the report reads, somewhat insultingly. When I tell Husick the viewing failed, she is unperturbed. \u201cI understand your initial reaction. Most people expect us to be like psychics in the movies and the reality is that our work is much more painstaking,\u201d she says. She explores Nami Island on Google and finds several consistencies with the viewers\u2019 visions. She points out that several viewers spoke of a tower-like feature near the target location \u2013 a zipwire runs from the mainland to the island. The report shows that Viewer 12 saw \u201cmultiples of human males rappelling downwards suspended by rope-like cords\u201d. Husick adds that, although I didn\u2019t see it, there is cascaded seating on the island \u2013 in a garden area \u2013 and it\u2019s adorned with flags, just as one viewer drew. She explains that if I were a real client, multiple sessions would have been undertaken, and this report is just a \u201cfirst pass\u201d at the target. Husick considers our session a success; I remain confused. The viewers\u2019 results are over 200 pages long. For every result that makes me gasp (Viewer 12 drew a structure that looks remarkably like my pagoda), another dampens my mood (one viewer saw an \u201cindustrial wasteland\u201d and \u201curban decay\u201d \u2013 the island is lush and green, and peacocks wander freely). Should I put stock in Husick\u2019s consistencies? Professor French says a cognitive bias known as \u201csubjective validation\u201d means people consider information correct if it has personal value to them (he notes that no one is immune and, thanks to his career, he himself has a vested interest in being a sceptic). \u201cHow do we know that those correspondences didn\u2019t just occur by chance? In 200 pages, there\u2019s bound to be elements that match any location you go to,\u201d he says. Yet Mossbridge argues it\u2019s still a growing business. \u201cThere are more and more people who are building applications of this work. Some are legitimate and some are not, but they\u2019re getting customers who are buying their work for reasonable and sometimes exorbitant prices, which means that the sceptics are not winning.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that those who do buy into the precog economy don\u2019t like to publicise the fact. Austin, Husick and Smith all say that police forces who work with them prefer to keep quiet about it, and Austin believes the precog economy will have to stay on the \u201cdownlow\u201d as it expands. \u201cIt scares people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt scares the hell out of them.\u201d Winning the lottery after a precognitive dream was the least remarkable part of Fatih Ozcan\u2019s story. The waiter only found out he\u2019d won nine days after the draw, because his boss kept the ticket and refused to halve the winnings. After protracted police proceedings, Ozcan took him to court. It was a distressing time \u2013 telling the story makes his voice shake. \u201cPeople were telling me I had no chance of winning the court case,\u201d he says. Yet midway through his ordeal, he received reassurance in the middle of the night. \u201cI had another dream showing me I would win the case,\u201d he recalls. After a week-long trial in 2014, a judge ruled that Ozcan should be given his \u00a3500,000 share.",

British subjects, most of them from the Caribbean, lost their jobs and their access to proper healthcare \u2013 and were in many cases deported to countries that they had last seen as young children. Gentleman tracked down one of them, Vernon Vanriel, in coastal Jamaica \u2013 where he was \u201cliving in an abandoned roadside grocery shack, with no electricity, no running water, no glass in the windows, and a flimsy plywood door that allowed the torrential rain to seep in\u201d.</p> <p>If much of this story is familiar that\u2019s largely due to Gentleman, whose reporting for the <em>Guardian</em> on this shameful episode saw her named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/11/guardians-amelia-gentleman-named-journalist-of-the-year\" title=\"\">journalist of the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/11/guardians-amelia-gentleman-named-journalist-of-the-year\" title=\"\">year</a> at the 2018 British journalism awards. It\u2019s still shocking to read about people who had given so much care to this country \u2013 nurses, NHS drivers, special needs teaching assistants \u2013 being treated so coldly. Jocelyn John, who was four when she arrived from Grenada in 1963, was expelled by the Home Office and told she had a baggage allowance of 20 kilos \u2013 \u201cYou will be expected to pay for any excess.\u201d</p> <p>On many occasions, <em>The Windrush Betrayal</em> reads like a <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/black-mirror\" title=\"\">Black Mirror</a></em>-style dystopia. Eviction notices were outsourced to Capita, who communicated by text: \u201cMessage from the UK Border Agency. You are required to leave the UK as you no longer have right to remain.\u201d Vans were hired to drive around London boroughs with billboards declaring: \u201cGo Home or Face Arrest.\u201d On 14 February 2013, the Home Office <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ukhomeoffice/status/302095617092632576\" title=\"\">twitter account announced</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ukhomeoffice/status/302095617092632576\" title=\"\">:</a> \u201c#Rosesareredvioletsareblue, if your marriage is a sham we\u2019ll be on to you ... #happyvalentinesday\u201d.</p> <p>Gentleman\u2019s book contains valuable lessons \u2013 about the importance of maintaining paper-based archives, of allowing citizens direct access to officials, and of supporting investigative journalism.

For Viv Adams, though, even the idea of return is an anathema: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a question of it being a sign of failure; it would be a sign of destruction.\u201d Amelia Gentleman\u2019s The Windrush Betrayal is a withering account of what happened when the Conservative party decided, in the words of the then home secretary Theresa May, \u201cto create here in Britain a really hostile environment for illegal migration\u201d. British subjects, most of them from the Caribbean, lost their jobs and their access to proper healthcare \u2013 and were in many cases deported to countries that they had last seen as young children. Gentleman tracked down one of them, Vernon Vanriel, in coastal Jamaica \u2013 where he was \u201cliving in an abandoned roadside grocery shack, with no electricity, no running water, no glass in the windows, and a flimsy plywood door that allowed the torrential rain to seep in\u201d. If much of this story is familiar that\u2019s largely due to Gentleman, whose reporting for the Guardian on this shameful episode saw her named journalist of the year at the 2018 British journalism awards. It\u2019s still shocking to read about people who had given so much care to this country \u2013 nurses, NHS drivers, special needs teaching assistants \u2013 being treated so coldly. Jocelyn John, who was four when she arrived from Grenada in 1963, was expelled by the Home Office and told she had a baggage allowance of 20 kilos \u2013 \u201cYou will be expected to pay for any excess.\u201d On many occasions, The Windrush Betrayal reads like a Black Mirror-style dystopia. Eviction notices were outsourced to Capita, who communicated by text: \u201cMessage from the UK Border Agency. You are required to leave the UK as you no longer have right to remain.\u201d Vans were hired to drive around London boroughs with billboards declaring: \u201cGo Home or Face Arrest.\u201d On 14 February 2013, the Home Office twitter account announced: \u201c#Rosesareredvioletsareblue, if your marriage is a sham we\u2019ll be on to you ... #happyvalentinesday\u201d. Gentleman\u2019s book contains valuable lessons \u2013 about the importance of maintaining paper-based archives, of allowing citizens direct access to officials, and of supporting investigative journalism. It closes with a worrying question: \u201cHow will the same department register the 3.5 million EU nationals who will need formal confirmation of their status in the UK after Brexit?\u201d \u2022 Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation by Colin Grant is published by Vintage (\u00a318.99).

On Sunday Nine papers published that the report, undertaken by a former bureaucrat, Peter Shergold, encouraged the government to create a \u201cmore positive narrative\u201d on refugees, and warned against a shift towards selecting refugees on a work-ready basis rather than on humanitarian need. The report was completed in February, but the immigration minister, David Coleman, is refusing to release it, despite the opposition and others, including Guardian Australia, trying to get it under freedom of information laws. When the review was commissioned by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in December, he said Shergold would recommend policy improvements and \u201cbetter ensure refugees and humanitarian entrants can make valuable contributions to our society and our economy\u201d. Guardian Australia understands Coleman does not intend to release the report until the end of the year when it is expected to be published along with the government\u2019s response. Labor\u2019s assistant immigration spokesman, Andrew Giles, said taxpayers had paid for the work that was aimed at improving the integration, employment and settlement outcomes of refugees in this country. \u201cRefugees have too often lived incredibly painful and dangerous lives, and when they settle in Australia we should be doing everything we can to help people get the support they need, find work and integrate into the community,\u201d he said. \u201cFailing to release this report is treating the public with contempt, as well as letting down refugees and our communities.\u201d According to details published on Sunday, Shergold recommended more funding be allocated to better tailor settlement services to individual refugees and their families, and to bring together services in central locations. The review also criticised the way settlement services for the 18,750 refugees who come to Australia each year under the United Nations-assisted humanitarian resettlement program are coordinated. The Settlement Council of Australia has told Guardian Australia there was a hope the \u201cclosely guarded\u201d report would lead to more integrated services. \u201cWe think it will have quite big implications for the sector \u2026 and how it\u2019s funded,\u201d said its chief executive, Tammy Wolffs. \u201cThere was a shake-up recently of the way settlement services have been funded and we can see there are better opportunities for integration and funding of settlement services, and the services and opportunities our sector can provide to refugees and other migrants who come through.\u201d \u2022 On 30 September 2019 the photograph on this article was replaced.

That\u2019s not the issue for the UK, but politicians like the idea of military service knocking our wayward teenagers into shape, physically and otherwise.</p> <p>So is military conscription what 21st-century Britain needs to get discipline up and crime down? No, says an <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ej/article-abstract/129/622/2522/5490322\" title=\"\"><em>Economic Journal</em> study</a> of conscription in Sweden.

Any day now a politician is bound to call for the return of military conscription of our youths into national service. David Cameron was trying to get there with his National Citizens Service, before events, as they say, got in the way. Lots of countries still do this, especially if they\u2019re near to Russia and its tendency to annex bits of other states. That\u2019s not the issue for the UK, but politicians like the idea of military service knocking our wayward teenagers into shape, physically and otherwise. So is military conscription what 21st-century Britain needs to get discipline up and crime down? No, says an Economic Journal study of conscription in Sweden. Indeed, it has the exact opposite effect, with military service significantly increasing the chances of young men committing crime afterwards \u2013 convictions go up by 32%. The effect is driven by young men from disadvantaged groups or who had criminal histories. In part that is because military service means they are less likely to get established in jobs. In fact, conscription (even of the Swedish variety) widened inequality \u2013 reducing earnings and employment for those from disadvantaged groups while increasing incomes for those from more wealthy backgrounds. So there\u2019s a lot more our politicians can do to help the youth of today \u2013 from providing better job or housing security to doing something about climate change. If any of them veer off track and start banging on about national service, consider it your national duty to put them straight. \u2022 Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

      "body": "<p>From Benguela, a city on the west coast of Angola, it takes four hours to reach the village of Cabio by car, first on potholed highways and then on unmarked sandy tracks that take you deep into the bush. It is a remote place, and a poor one. Its 82 inhabitants live in tiny houses built of mud bricks and corrugated iron. Its open-air church is little more than an arrangement of sticks. Its school is a blackboard tacked to a tree.</p> <p>For the newcomer, however, Cabio has a surprise up its sleeve. Though barely reachable by road, the village is a stop on the Benguela Railway, which runs from the port of Lobito in the west all the way to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the east. The railway, which fell into disrepair during Angola\u2019s brutal civil war, was reconstructed between 2006 and 2014 by the Chinese, and with it Cabio\u2019s station. Flamingo pink, in the Portuguese style, it could not look more incongruous if it tried.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-zip/giv-3902AZVSInNqJgUk/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-zip/giv-3902AZVSInNqJgUk/\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Thanks to its proximity to this railway, Cabio was strategically important during the war, and although there are no soldiers here now, its inhabitants still live with a legacy of those days. Next to the village, on a hill where livestock should be able to graze and children to play, is a minefield laid to protect a former army position (this point was held by the armed wing of the People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA], the party that now governs the country). It is the size of seven football pitches.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2019/sep/29/the-mine-clearing-women-of-angola-in-pictures\">The mine-clearing women of Angola \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During the worst of the fighting, Cabio was evacuated. When its people returned, no one told them what had happened to their land while they were away. \u201cBut our animals kept dying,\u201d says Jose Palanga, the village chief. \u201cThat was how we knew.\u201d In Angola, a cow can be worth up to $600; to lose one means the difference between a family eating and going hungry. \u201cThe minefield was destroying our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cried out for help. We begged for it.\u201d None came.</p> <p>As the years ticked by, the villagers could only be grateful that no human had yet stepped on a mine (anti-personnel mines of the kind buried here detonate easily; all it takes is a child playing with a stick).</p> <p>But last January, <a href=\"https://www.halotrust.org/\" title=\"\">the Halo Trust</a>, the British landmine charity, set up camp in the village, bringing with it a small army of its own in the form of 18 Angolan women mine clearers. Having since removed 197 mines and 50 items of unexploded ordnance from the area, it hopes to complete the job next month \u2013 at which point the land will be returned to the villagers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20a53f6143ecbd6db5a5658d0a1b9e91cbba81da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20a53f6143ecbd6db5a5658d0a1b9e91cbba81da/461_18_2579_1548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Princess Diana walking in one of the safety corridors of the landmine fields of Huambo in 1997 and Prince Harry in Dirico last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Princess Diana walking in one of the safety corridors of the landmine fields of Huambo in 1997 and Prince Harry in Dirico last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juda Ngwenya/Dominic Lipinski/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how happy we\u2019ll be,\u201d says Palanga. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to build. Perhaps more families will come here. Perhaps the village will get bigger.\u201d</p> <p>The mine clearers, who live on site for 24 days at a time, are part of 100 Women, a project that aims to empower those involved, as well as to clear mines. So far, 78 have been recruited. Most clear mines, but some work in other capacities: for instance, as cooks. For one in five, this is their first job. Many are single mothers; three-quarters have three or more dependents. The work brings with it a decent salary, and some will tell you happily that it has helped them to buy land, even to build a house.</p> <p>But the gains are not only financial. Clearing mines is both extremely dangerous and of immense benefit to Angola, one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. The job brings with it a certain respect.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I heard they weren\u2019t just recruiting men, I felt it was my duty to show that women could do this, too, by being one of them,\u201d says Maria Niva, who at 19 is one of the youngest women at Cabio (Niva is one of those who met the Duke of Sussex when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/27/prince-harry-follows-in-dianas-footsteps-in-fight-against-landmines\" title=\"\">he visited a \u201ctransformed\u201d Huambo </a>last week, hoping to boost the anti-landmine campaign begun there by his mother, Princess Diana).</p> <p>Wasn\u2019t she frightened? \u201cThe first time I saw an explosion, yes, I was. But you get used to things.\u201d She smiles. \u201cA big change is coming to Angola. It will be safe at last, and that will be amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Her optimism is infectious. But the task ahead is huge. Angola\u2019s civil war began in 1975. By the time it ended in 2002, more than 500,000 Angolans were dead, millions had been displaced, and its countryside, cities and roads were covered in mines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce0d0141e48ebf947062fb5175d3ea0cfd213429\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce0d0141e48ebf947062fb5175d3ea0cfd213429/0_417_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Niva prepares her equipment before going to work.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria Niva prepares her equipment before going to work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How many mines are there in Angola? It\u2019s impossible to say. The various factions left no maps. Halo, which has 381 staff here working in 28 operational teams, has so far cleared 100,000 landmines (75 different kinds of devices, manufactured in 22 different countries). In Cuito Cuanavale alone \u2013 the site, between August 1987 and March 1988, of the biggest battle in Africa since the second world war \u2013 it has cleared 35,000 mines. Across Angola, 1,100 known minefields remain, in which there may be up to 500,000 devices.</p> <p>Could the country, a signatory of the 1997 Ottawa treaty, the convention banning landmines, meet its commitment to being mine-free by 2025? Only if the work, whose estimated cost is \u00a3214m, is fully funded by international donors such as the US and British governments. More money is needed. Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, has said that at the current rate of funding, Angola will not be mine-free until 2046.</p> <p>The women at Cabio camp rise at five, put on their boots and uniforms, and line up outside their tents for registration, their faces still morning-soft as they respond to their names (I\u2019ve spent the night in camp with them). Five minutes later, they and their protective gear are in the back of a truck, and moments after this they are by the railway line. Although highly trained \u2013 each one attended a month-long de-mining course \u2013 every shift begins with a demonstration of part of the process: a reminder of the ever-present dangers of the work ahead (these dangers are brought home to me when, before I join them, a note is made of my blood group). An ambulance also waits beside the railway line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"61c31af94cfb5198c479c08f3cd7fde99e53904b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61c31af94cfb5198c479c08f3cd7fde99e53904b/0_525_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Suzana Soares: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see the area we\u2019ve cleared.\u201d\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suzana Soares: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see the area we\u2019ve cleared.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After this, the sun now almost up, they spread out, each claiming a spot at the edge of land that has already been cleared. A whistle blows: a sign they should get ready to begin. When it sounds for a second time, they fall to their knees, moving their metal detectors over a small rectangle of earth they have first carefully marked out with red cord. If the detector makes no sound, they shuffle forwards, and repeat. Beside them is a bucket of tools: shears for tackling the brush; painted sticks to mark areas that have been cleared. In some places, Halo uses heavy machinery to clear mines. But Cabio\u2019s isolation, and the lie of the land, make that impossible here. The job must be done by hand, inch by inch. It is intense work, and they do it in half-hour segments, a 10-minute break between each one.</p> <p>\u201cI like blowing the whistle,\u201d says Suzana Soares, with a grin. Soares, who is 28, started as a cook, moved into mine clearing and <a href=\"https://www.halotrust.org/latest/halo-updates/stories/100-women-in-angola-suzanas-story/\" title=\"\">is now a section commander</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility to make sure they\u2019re all safe; that they all take a break. It\u2019s a big job, and I\u2019ve been chosen from among all these girls.\u201d</p> <p>While she\u2019s away, her sister looks after her small daughter. She misses her, and finds this hard. \u201cIt\u2019s not a piece of cake,\u201d she says. But it\u2019s worth it. She is no longer dependent on her parents; she can give her child anything she needs. Like everyone here, her family was affected by the war. Now she has the chance to effect change in her country: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see the area we\u2019ve cleared.\u201d</p> <p>There is a kind of feminism in the air. Esperan\u00e7a Ngando, who is 24, tells me she was compelled to apply for a job at Halo when the recruiter told her that her work would save people\u2019s lives (she is another of those who met Harry in Huambo \u2013 though when I speak to her the week before his visit, she has no idea who he is). \u201cThose words got to me,\u201d she says. When she realised she would have to live in a tent in the bush for weeks at a time, she cried: she has a husband and three-year-old son. But she likes the life now. She has found solidarity here. \u201cWe\u2019re happy together. It\u2019s a family.\u201d</p> <p>Some days, the women find nothing. But on the morning of my visit, a mine is discovered \u2013 this makes them all very happy \u2013 and before I leave, it is detonated in a controlled blast. Watching such an explosion, you wonder how anyone who comes unexpectedly into contact with such a device could possibly survive. But survive they do, albeit with horrifying injuries. The 2014 census recorded 88,000 living victims of the explosive remnants of war (the real number is probably higher). Accidents, moreover, continue to happen even in areas that, officially, have been cleared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c1a46025da16b80295caef64ea083b6e3b1cf7e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1a46025da16b80295caef64ea083b6e3b1cf7e4/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manuel Rodriguez with his mother Ermelinda Victoria Jaime.

      "bodyText": "From Benguela, a city on the west coast of Angola, it takes four hours to reach the village of Cabio by car, first on potholed highways and then on unmarked sandy tracks that take you deep into the bush. It is a remote place, and a poor one. Its 82 inhabitants live in tiny houses built of mud bricks and corrugated iron. Its open-air church is little more than an arrangement of sticks. Its school is a blackboard tacked to a tree. For the newcomer, however, Cabio has a surprise up its sleeve. Though barely reachable by road, the village is a stop on the Benguela Railway, which runs from the port of Lobito in the west all the way to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the east. The railway, which fell into disrepair during Angola\u2019s brutal civil war, was reconstructed between 2006 and 2014 by the Chinese, and with it Cabio\u2019s station. Flamingo pink, in the Portuguese style, it could not look more incongruous if it tried. Thanks to its proximity to this railway, Cabio was strategically important during the war, and although there are no soldiers here now, its inhabitants still live with a legacy of those days. Next to the village, on a hill where livestock should be able to graze and children to play, is a minefield laid to protect a former army position (this point was held by the armed wing of the People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA], the party that now governs the country). It is the size of seven football pitches. During the worst of the fighting, Cabio was evacuated. When its people returned, no one told them what had happened to their land while they were away. \u201cBut our animals kept dying,\u201d says Jose Palanga, the village chief. \u201cThat was how we knew.\u201d In Angola, a cow can be worth up to $600; to lose one means the difference between a family eating and going hungry. \u201cThe minefield was destroying our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cried out for help. We begged for it.\u201d None came. As the years ticked by, the villagers could only be grateful that no human had yet stepped on a mine (anti-personnel mines of the kind buried here detonate easily; all it takes is a child playing with a stick). But last January, the Halo Trust, the British landmine charity, set up camp in the village, bringing with it a small army of its own in the form of 18 Angolan women mine clearers. Having since removed 197 mines and 50 items of unexploded ordnance from the area, it hopes to complete the job next month \u2013 at which point the land will be returned to the villagers. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how happy we\u2019ll be,\u201d says Palanga. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to build. Perhaps more families will come here. Perhaps the village will get bigger.\u201d The mine clearers, who live on site for 24 days at a time, are part of 100 Women, a project that aims to empower those involved, as well as to clear mines. So far, 78 have been recruited. Most clear mines, but some work in other capacities: for instance, as cooks. For one in five, this is their first job. Many are single mothers; three-quarters have three or more dependents. The work brings with it a decent salary, and some will tell you happily that it has helped them to buy land, even to build a house. But the gains are not only financial. Clearing mines is both extremely dangerous and of immense benefit to Angola, one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. The job brings with it a certain respect. \u201cWhen I heard they weren\u2019t just recruiting men, I felt it was my duty to show that women could do this, too, by being one of them,\u201d says Maria Niva, who at 19 is one of the youngest women at Cabio (Niva is one of those who met the Duke of Sussex when he visited a \u201ctransformed\u201d Huambo last week, hoping to boost the anti-landmine campaign begun there by his mother, Princess Diana). Wasn\u2019t she frightened? \u201cThe first time I saw an explosion, yes, I was. But you get used to things.\u201d She smiles. \u201cA big change is coming to Angola. It will be safe at last, and that will be amazing.\u201d Her optimism is infectious. But the task ahead is huge. Angola\u2019s civil war began in 1975. By the time it ended in 2002, more than 500,000 Angolans were dead, millions had been displaced, and its countryside, cities and roads were covered in mines. How many mines are there in Angola? It\u2019s impossible to say. The various factions left no maps. Halo, which has 381 staff here working in 28 operational teams, has so far cleared 100,000 landmines (75 different kinds of devices, manufactured in 22 different countries). In Cuito Cuanavale alone \u2013 the site, between August 1987 and March 1988, of the biggest battle in Africa since the second world war \u2013 it has cleared 35,000 mines. Across Angola, 1,100 known minefields remain, in which there may be up to 500,000 devices. Could the country, a signatory of the 1997 Ottawa treaty, the convention banning landmines, meet its commitment to being mine-free by 2025? Only if the work, whose estimated cost is \u00a3214m, is fully funded by international donors such as the US and British governments. More money is needed. Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, has said that at the current rate of funding, Angola will not be mine-free until 2046. The women at Cabio camp rise at five, put on their boots and uniforms, and line up outside their tents for registration, their faces still morning-soft as they respond to their names (I\u2019ve spent the night in camp with them). Five minutes later, they and their protective gear are in the back of a truck, and moments after this they are by the railway line. Although highly trained \u2013 each one attended a month-long de-mining course \u2013 every shift begins with a demonstration of part of the process: a reminder of the ever-present dangers of the work ahead (these dangers are brought home to me when, before I join them, a note is made of my blood group). An ambulance also waits beside the railway line. After this, the sun now almost up, they spread out, each claiming a spot at the edge of land that has already been cleared. A whistle blows: a sign they should get ready to begin. When it sounds for a second time, they fall to their knees, moving their metal detectors over a small rectangle of earth they have first carefully marked out with red cord. If the detector makes no sound, they shuffle forwards, and repeat. Beside them is a bucket of tools: shears for tackling the brush; painted sticks to mark areas that have been cleared. In some places, Halo uses heavy machinery to clear mines. But Cabio\u2019s isolation, and the lie of the land, make that impossible here. The job must be done by hand, inch by inch. It is intense work, and they do it in half-hour segments, a 10-minute break between each one. \u201cI like blowing the whistle,\u201d says Suzana Soares, with a grin. Soares, who is 28, started as a cook, moved into mine clearing and is now a section commander. \u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility to make sure they\u2019re all safe; that they all take a break. It\u2019s a big job, and I\u2019ve been chosen from among all these girls.\u201d While she\u2019s away, her sister looks after her small daughter. She misses her, and finds this hard. \u201cIt\u2019s not a piece of cake,\u201d she says. But it\u2019s worth it. She is no longer dependent on her parents; she can give her child anything she needs. Like everyone here, her family was affected by the war. Now she has the chance to effect change in her country: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see the area we\u2019ve cleared.\u201d There is a kind of feminism in the air. Esperan\u00e7a Ngando, who is 24, tells me she was compelled to apply for a job at Halo when the recruiter told her that her work would save people\u2019s lives (she is another of those who met Harry in Huambo \u2013 though when I speak to her the week before his visit, she has no idea who he is). \u201cThose words got to me,\u201d she says.

In Huambo, the next stop on my journey, only one uncleared mine field remains, and as a result, the city has grown hugely since Diana\u2019s visit in 1997. Minefield H013, which she crossed in full protective kit, has been fully cleared since 2005, and is now, as her son found out when he walked in her footsteps last week, a busy street, thronged with people and traffic (in 1997, it was still semi-rural).

Adaptable, foldable, portable and (virtually) unpinchable, it is the urban equivalent of a queue-busting fast pass at a theme park. But now this lifelong townie is eyeing up the countryside and planning trips that will take it further afield and into pastures new. To capture cycling\u2019s inherent spirit of adventure, Brompton has created the Explore edition. If you imagine that means chunkier wheels, suspension and mud-splattered cranks, you will be disappointed. In fact, it means little more than a very comfortable saddle, a pouch that you can load with accessories to keep you on the go and special six-speed gearing to take the thigh-burn out of steep hills. It has also been given tan-walled tyres and an earthy paint job so that you\u2019ll blend into the landscape rather than looking like a metropolitan escape artist. To be fair to Brompton, the Explore does push home the fact that these little bikes really can go anywhere. Intrepid riders have already pedalled them at the South Pole and from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats. So, forget the office and cycle somewhere new.</p> <h2>Cool kit</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c82b8ba1cfb5acc6a8913d743a6fd69ee7e03fa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c82b8ba1cfb5acc6a8913d743a6fd69ee7e03fa8/0_767_2400_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hats off to the world championships: UCI\u2019s cap with rainbow stripes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hats off to the world championships: UCI\u2019s cap with rainbow stripes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Santini, the producers of the official UCI kit, have created this UCI Collection so you can wear your own rainbow stripes.

      "bodyText": "Brompton Explore Price \u00a31,570, cyclesurgery.com Gears 6 Saddle Brooks Cambium C17 All-Weather Few bikes are more perfectly evolved for city living than the Brompton. Adaptable, foldable, portable and (virtually) unpinchable, it is the urban equivalent of a queue-busting fast pass at a theme park. But now this lifelong townie is eyeing up the countryside and planning trips that will take it further afield and into pastures new. To capture cycling\u2019s inherent spirit of adventure, Brompton has created the Explore edition. If you imagine that means chunkier wheels, suspension and mud-splattered cranks, you will be disappointed. In fact, it means little more than a very comfortable saddle, a pouch that you can load with accessories to keep you on the go and special six-speed gearing to take the thigh-burn out of steep hills. It has also been given tan-walled tyres and an earthy paint job so that you\u2019ll blend into the landscape rather than looking like a metropolitan escape artist. To be fair to Brompton, the Explore does push home the fact that these little bikes really can go anywhere. Intrepid riders have already pedalled them at the South Pole and from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats. So, forget the office and cycle somewhere new. Cool kit Santini, the producers of the official UCI kit, have created this UCI Collection so you can wear your own rainbow stripes. Worn on or off the bike to add some extra style to your look, Santini\u2019s Cycling Cap has a UCI Collection design with rainbow stripes on the peak. The central breathable mesh insert keeps things cool and when worn peak down you\u2019ll get excellent protection from the elements.

      "bodyText": "Up until a month ago, it sometimes seemed like everybody vaped, from international celebrities to local teens. Now, it can feel as if everybody is trying to quit. Amid reports of at least 805 cases of vaping-related lung injury in 46 states and one US territory, states including New York, Massachusetts, Michigan and Rhode Island have all banned sales of flavored electronic cigarette products. In California, where e-cigarette giant Juul Labs is headquartered, the matter has particularly hit home, with the state\u2019s department of public health issuing an advisory this week urging \u201ceveryone to refrain from vaping\u201d and the governor launching a $20m public awareness campaign about the dangers of it. Even Donald Trump is developing a federal flavored e-cigarette ban. \u201cThey\u2019ve been touted as safer than cigarettes, even to the extreme of being safe, period,\u201d said John Maa, a past president of the San Francisco Marin Medical Society. \u201cBut we don\u2019t really know what the effects of chronic vaping is on your lungs.\u201d And yet it was not that long ago that vaping was widely accepted as the healthier alternative to cigarettes. When e-cigarettes entered the US marketplace in about 2007, they were billed as a tool to help smokers quit smoking . Like cigarettes, they contain nicotine, but not its parent compound, tobacco, which kills up to half its users. To many, the process of vaping also felt better than smoking and with a wide variety in flavors, they appealed to an audience much wider than smokers. \u201cSomeone who doesn\u2019t smoke might pick up a cigarette, take a few puffs, cough, and question why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d Maa said. \u201cBut with an electronic cigarette, it\u2019s tasty.

And in far too many cases, the kids didn\u2019t know what they were doing. Almost two-thirds of Juul users ages 15 to 24 surveyed by the Truth Initiative in 2018 did not know that their Juuls contained highly addictive nicotine, a substance known to be particularly harmful for youth whose brains are still developing. \u201cThese kids were trying them out because they tasted nice,\u201d said Mahzad Hite, an attorney working on a number of personal injury lawsuits against Juul. \u201cNicotine can have long lasting and sometimes permanent effects on the brain of people under the age of 26. We\u2019re seeing kids who were honor students who are now failing their classes. We\u2019re seeing kids who were athletes who can longer perform.\u201d Hite works at the San Francisco-based law firm Levin Simes Abrams, which has filed 60 lawsuits against Juul in the past months. \u201cThe science is developing, and I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing so many reports now, even though vaping has been around for years,\u201d said attorney Rachel Abrams. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing people going in with lung issues and not knowing what\u2019s contributing to them and not willing to admit that they\u2019re vaping.\u201d Abrams and Hite represent clients who have ended up in the hospital because of lung issues believed to have been caused by vaping.

The US attorney\u2019s office of the northern district of California has opened a criminal investigation into Juul, the Wall Street Journal reported this week, though the focus of the inquiry is still unclear. On Thursday, San Joaquin County district attorney Tori Salazar announced that she was launching both a criminal and civil investigation into Juul, looking into the company\u2019s marketing and targeting of youth. The US Federal Trade Commission is also investigating whether Juul used deceptive social marketing that targeted minors. On Wednesday, Juul\u2019s chief executive Kevin Burns stepped down and was replaced by KC Crosthwaite, chief strategy officer at Altria, the tobacco giant that is Juul\u2019s largest shareholder. \u201cI have long believed in a future where adult smokers overwhelmingly choose alternative products like Juul,\u201d Crosthwaite said in a statement. \u201cThat has been this company\u2019s mission since it was founded, and it has taken great strides in that direction.

      "body": "<p><strong>Gen del Alma Jiji Red, Tupungato, Mendoza, Argentina 2018 (from \u00a317.50, <a href=\"http://standrewswinecompany.com\">St Aandrew\u2019s Wine Company</a>; <a href=\"http://noblegreenwines.co.uk\">Noble Geen Wines</a>)</strong> Of the thousands of wine tastings that are put on by the wine trade in London over the course of a year, one of the highlights is always an annual event hosted by 12 of the UK\u2019s best small importers. As ever this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dirtydozentasting.com/\">Dirty Dozen</a> tasting was packed to the rafters with sommeliers, merchants and press looking for the importers\u2019 latest discoveries (each showed a couple of dozen wines each) \u2013 and an insight into what\u2019s going on in each of their areas of expertise. What\u2019s new? Well, Indigo Wines, originally known for bringing the best of a new wave of Spanish wines to the UK, has been branching out and was showing a pair of wines that show off the new, funkier side of Argentine wine from winemaking couple Andrea Mufatto and Gerardo Michelini. Their wild-cherried, slippery textured, super-fresh red blend was a personal favourite.</p> <p><strong>Julien Sunier Morgon, Beaujolais, France 2017 (\u00a327.50, <a href=\"http://robersonwine.com\">Roberson Wine</a>)</strong> The Jiji red is representative of a kind of red winemaking that has been the fashionable default around the world for some time now. It\u2019s a style \u2013 genre might be a better word \u2013 loosely inspired by or indebted to the wines of Burgundy and Beaujolais, where elegance, freshness and what tends to be called drinkability is more prized than power. Examples on various points of this spectrum abounded at The Dirty Dozen, from the almost piercingly racy, vividly coloured, fresh-berried exhilaration of Anselmo Mendes Vinh\u00e3o 2018 (\u00a314, <a href=\"http://bottleapostle.com\">Bottle Apostle</a>) from Portugal\u2019s northern, and generally white winemaking Vinho Verde to the beautifully elegant, Burgundy-challenging perfumed prettiness of German pinot noir in Weingut J\u00fclg Sp\u00e4tbrugner, Pfalz 2015 (\u00a313.48, <a href=\"http://howardripley.com\">Howard Ripley</a>). And from the astonishingly good, gorgeously poised modern Californian of Hirsch Sonoma Coast An Andreas Fault Pinot Noir 2016 (\u00a364, <a href=\"http://robersonwine.com\">Roberson Wine</a>) to the outstanding, deep, layered but super-silky and fresh-finishing Beaujolais of Julien Sunier.</p> <p><strong>Tenuta Tobia Rosso No 1, Tuscany Italy 2014 (\u00a318.95, <a href=\"http://swig.co.uk\">Swig</a>)</strong> One of my favourite white wines at the Dirty Dozen tasting was actually a good deal more powerful than many of the reds: Ellio Ottin Petite Arvine 2017 (from \u00a325, <a href=\"http://oldbridgewine.co.uk\">Old Bridge Wine</a>; <a href=\"http://laywheeler.com\">Lay &amp; Wheeler</a>) from the high altitude vines of the Valle d\u2019Aosta in far northwestern Italy clocks in at 14.5% alcohol. But the weight and fullness and honeyed peachiness of a wine made from a grape variety, petite arvine, better known for making some of Switzerland\u2019s best whites, is balanced by a racing stream of cool freshness. A similar balancing act between toasty-creamy richness and a tart-apple bite of juicy freshness can be found in Dewaldt Heyns Weathered Hands Chein Blanc, Tulbagh, South Africa (\u00a317.25, <a href=\"tel:h2vin.co.uk\">H2Vin</a>). For a red of power and southern-sun infused flavour, Tuscany provided a Dirty Dozen standout in the complex form of Tenuta Tobia\u2019s warm earthy, leathery, dried herby smoothie from vines near the Brunello di Montalcino zone.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Gen del Alma Jiji Red, Tupungato, Mendoza, Argentina 2018 (from \u00a317.50, St Aandrew\u2019s Wine Company; Noble Geen Wines) Of the thousands of wine tastings that are put on by the wine trade in London over the course of a year, one of the highlights is always an annual event hosted by 12 of the UK\u2019s best small importers. As ever this year\u2019s Dirty Dozen tasting was packed to the rafters with sommeliers, merchants and press looking for the importers\u2019 latest discoveries (each showed a couple of dozen wines each) \u2013 and an insight into what\u2019s going on in each of their areas of expertise. What\u2019s new? Well, Indigo Wines, originally known for bringing the best of a new wave of Spanish wines to the UK, has been branching out and was showing a pair of wines that show off the new, funkier side of Argentine wine from winemaking couple Andrea Mufatto and Gerardo Michelini. Their wild-cherried, slippery textured, super-fresh red blend was a personal favourite. Julien Sunier Morgon, Beaujolais, France 2017 (\u00a327.50, Roberson Wine) The Jiji red is representative of a kind of red winemaking that has been the fashionable default around the world for some time now. It\u2019s a style \u2013 genre might be a better word \u2013 loosely inspired by or indebted to the wines of Burgundy and Beaujolais, where elegance, freshness and what tends to be called drinkability is more prized than power. Examples on various points of this spectrum abounded at The Dirty Dozen, from the almost piercingly racy, vividly coloured, fresh-berried exhilaration of Anselmo Mendes Vinh\u00e3o 2018 (\u00a314, Bottle Apostle) from Portugal\u2019s northern, and generally white winemaking Vinho Verde to the beautifully elegant, Burgundy-challenging perfumed prettiness of German pinot noir in Weingut J\u00fclg Sp\u00e4tbrugner, Pfalz 2015 (\u00a313.48, Howard Ripley). And from the astonishingly good, gorgeously poised modern Californian of Hirsch Sonoma Coast An Andreas Fault Pinot Noir 2016 (\u00a364, Roberson Wine) to the outstanding, deep, layered but super-silky and fresh-finishing Beaujolais of Julien Sunier. Tenuta Tobia Rosso No 1, Tuscany Italy 2014 (\u00a318.95, Swig) One of my favourite white wines at the Dirty Dozen tasting was actually a good deal more powerful than many of the reds: Ellio Ottin Petite Arvine 2017 (from \u00a325, Old Bridge Wine; Lay &amp; Wheeler) from the high altitude vines of the Valle d\u2019Aosta in far northwestern Italy clocks in at 14.5% alcohol. But the weight and fullness and honeyed peachiness of a wine made from a grape variety, petite arvine, better known for making some of Switzerland\u2019s best whites, is balanced by a racing stream of cool freshness. A similar balancing act between toasty-creamy richness and a tart-apple bite of juicy freshness can be found in Dewaldt Heyns Weathered Hands Chein Blanc, Tulbagh, South Africa (\u00a317.25, H2Vin). For a red of power and southern-sun infused flavour, Tuscany provided a Dirty Dozen standout in the complex form of Tenuta Tobia\u2019s warm earthy, leathery, dried herby smoothie from vines near the Brunello di Montalcino zone.

      "bodyText": "In the explosive whistleblower complaint released this week, in which an intelligence official sounds the alarm over Donald Trump\u2019s effort to solicit the help of Ukraine in his bid for re-election, one name is repeated: Rudy Giuliani. The former New York mayor appears in flashing lights at the top of the document. In the second paragraph, the anonymous whistleblower says: \u201cThe president\u2019s personal lawyer, Mr Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort.\u201d The author goes on to refer to Giuliani 31 times, painting a picture of a lawyer who in the service of his old friend and now personal client \u2013 Trump \u2013 set himself up as a virtual state within a state. Giuliani is accused of circumventing national security protocols as he scurried between Washington and Kyiv carrying private orders from the president, many of dubious legality. That the man who was hailed as a national hero, \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d, in the wake of 9/11 should now find himself accused of undermining national security amid a billowing impeachment scandal is extraordinary in itself. Even more astonishing is that so many of the details of the Ukraine connection have been put into the public domain by Giuliani himself. He has been so willing to speak openly on cable TV and social media about his dealings with top Ukrainian officials seeking dirt on the leading Democratic presidential candidate, former vice-president Joe Biden, that he has deepened Trump\u2019s legal peril almost on a daily basis. On Thursday, Giuliani posted a tweet that extended the crisis from the White House to the state department. In the tweet, he reproduced a July text message from Kurt Volker, then US special representative to Ukraine, introducing Giuliani to a key adviser of the Ukrainian president. The chilling undertone of the tweet was unmistakable: if I\u2019m going down, you\u2019re going down with me. Giuliani\u2019s overseas consulting work in eastern Europe stretches back to the mid-2000s. But his prominence in Ukraine grew after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, when he parlayed his close relationship with the president into security contracts and speaking appearances. By his own account, Giuliani\u2019s fixation with Ukraine began last November when, he told Fox News, he was approached by a \u201cvery significant distinguished investigator\u201d. He has not named the investigator, though the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and other sources have illuminated close ties between the former mayor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who until last month was Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor, and Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor, Viktor Shokin. As the complaint sets out, Giuliani met Lutsenko at least twice: in New York in January and in Warsaw the following month. The timing of those encounters could be important in the rapidly unfolding impeachment inquiry in Washington, as they came at a key moment for Lutsenko. The prosecutor was facing growing criticism in Kyiv over stalled investigations into corruption. In November 2018, when Giuliani says he began to focus on the country, Lutsenko offered to resign after a young anti-corruption activist, Kateryna Handziuk, died from a sulphuric acid attack. Lutsenko stayed in office. But the Guardian has learned that he began seeking a lifeline to the US, in the hope it might save him as difficulties back home intensified. That lifeline was Giuliani. \u201c[Lutsenko] strongly needed some political ally, he believed that Giuliani could convey specific messages to Trump, and he created this message to become more interesting to the American establishment,\u201d said a law enforcement source familiar with the Giuliani-Lutsenko connection. That Giuliani might have been fed information by Ukraine\u2019s then top prosecutor that was adulterated to make it more appealing to Trump is a startling potential twist in the developing scandal. According to the Guardian\u2019s source, Lutsenko appeared in conversation with Giuliani to have invented a \u201cdon\u2019t prosecute\u201d list he claimed was given to him by the then US ambassador to Kyiv, Marie Yovanovitch \u2013 news of which apparently made its way up to Trump. Yovanovitch was abruptly removed in May after Giuliani pressed for changes in the embassy. Giuliani has since claimed without evidence that the \u201cdon\u2019t prosecute\u201d list was part of a liberal anti-Trump conspiracy that included Yovanovitch and was bankrolled by the philanthropist George Soros. The US state department has dismissed the claim as an \u201coutright fabrication\u201d. \u2018Very helpful to my client\u2019 Ukraine\u2019s main attraction for Giuliani was the hope it might provide valuable damaging intelligence on Biden, who launched his presidential bid in April.

Lutsenko later changed his tune, and told the Washington Post this week Hunter Biden had done nothing wrong. \u201cFrom the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,\u201d the former prosecutor said.

Well, not all the time. I\u2019ve had so-called \u2018loved by A-listers\u2019 facials where I\u2019ve left with a greasy, filthy face. But at the Face Place, however, my skin went from congested to pores so clean you could eat off it. It is a no-nonsense facial with a clinical approach, which I love \u2013 anything floaty is a waste of money. The key is extractions (a facial without extractions is like a car without wheels). Be warned, a heated dome is placed on your face to prepare it for this process, so claustrophobes may struggle. The current used encourages collagen production. A facial massage gets rid of excess fluids, toxins and puffiness. A vitamin C and zinc infusion provides the glow, particularly after a skin peel (yes it tingles, but not unbearably so). The result is decongested, contoured, glowing skin and no downtime. Which is exactly why Hollywood loves it.</p> <h2>On my radar: three of the best skin-loving foundations</h2> <p><strong>Turn up the base </strong>All dewy-skin fans will love this liquid foundation.

A facial massage gets rid of excess fluids, toxins and puffiness. A vitamin C and zinc infusion provides the glow, particularly after a skin peel (yes it tingles, but not unbearably so). The result is decongested, contoured, glowing skin and no downtime. Which is exactly why Hollywood loves it. On my radar: three of the best skin-loving foundations Turn up the base All dewy-skin fans will love this liquid foundation. It\u2019s medium to full cover, but is feather light, oil-free, goes on like a serum and comes in 50 shades. The dream. Anastasia Beverly Hills Luminous Foundation, \u00a343, selfridges.com All-day ready Created with cutting-edge technology, this skin-loving formula (infused with SPF and antioxidants) adapts to skin so you get a \u2018just applied\u2019 finish \u2013 all day long. Shiseido Synchro Skin Self-Refreshing Foundation, \u00a339, shiseido.com The gentle touch The calming properties of blue lotus and camomile in this \u2018flex\u2019 foundation (no creases or caking) make a long-wear base that\u2019s perfect for sensitive and acneic skins.

It opened in July and occupies a simple hut on the edge of <a href=\"http://stepneycityfarm.org/\" title=\"\">Stepney City Farm</a> in London\u2019s East End. There\u2019s mismatched furniture, games of Jenga and Scrabble on the tables, and an awful lot of peace. I suspect it would be a calming space in which to linger in any circumstances, but chefs Alice Wilson and Matt Hall are busily providing a whole bunch of edible reasons for going there in the first place. The Humble Bee feels like a place where nothing bad can happen, and keep not happening.</p> <p>The city-farm setting is key. So far, it\u2019s providing just 15% of the ingredients, but will, in time, provide much more. There are those who will tell you that places like this are a solution to the apparent iniquities of Big Food Retail, with capital letters; of long supply chains, and concrete jungles so far from the fields; that we could all eat local if only we put our minds to it, and lifted the paving stones to find the dark fertile earth beneath. It\u2019s a sweet fantasy, though a fantasy all the same. The proponents of practical urban farming always seem to underestimate the true scale of the demand for food in densely populated cities.</p> <p>None of that should detract from the vital importance of places like this. Saying city farms have educational value is like saying a glass of water will quench your thirst. Of course they do. There are arts and training projects here for people with disabilities; regularly the paths throng with visits by schools. It is space in which the old skills are kept alive. But there are other less tangible virtues to do with simple wellbeing and an environment that has been nurtured into life for the past 40 years by the local community. The farm has returned the favour, by nurturing the community within which it sits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c1b7f61bbe01fb3ae0e019253c33b5ab3111a45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c1b7f61bbe01fb3ae0e019253c33b5ab3111a45/687_487_4039_2423/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A round white plate with thick egg mayo, discs of chorizo and a few pieces of rocket on toast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Outrageous\u2019: egg mayonnaise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On these three acres they grow giant pumpkins and broad beans, beetroots and garlic, redcurrants, rhubarb and so much more besides. There are farm animals, too, including pigs, sheep, ducks and geese, kept not as pets for children merely to coo over, although there is a bit of that. The animals are bred for market. It is a working farm with a purpose. On an early autumn day, with the warm sun now a little lower in the sky, and the foliage starting to sag with weight from a long, exhausting summer of frenetic growth, the rest of the city beyond the gates feels a very long way away.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Eggs cooked soft then broken up and heaped one atop the other, with thin discs of chorizo</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wilson and Hall, who have worked everywhere from high-end restaurants through community caf\u00e9s to food banks, met at the Borough Market outpost of steak mavens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/18/jay-rayner-restaurant-hawksmoor-air-street\" title=\"\">Hawksmoor</a>. There is a little meat on the menu here, some of it from the animals kept on the farm. Breakfasts do offer a bacon sandwich. But for the most part the menu scribbled on the blackboard goes the way of the vegetable. What defines it all is the attention to the fundamentals. Today for \u00a36.50, there is a salad of both roasted and pickled fennel, with the caramelised, nutty bite of roasted Jerusalem artichokes, heaps of soft green lentils and cherry tomatoes bursting from their skins.

      "bodyText": "The Humble Bee Caf\u00e9. Stepney City Farm, Stepney Way, London E1 3DG. No bookings. All food \u00a33.25 to \u00a36.50 Lunch at the Humble Bee Caf\u00e9 is a meal in a very happy place. It opened in July and occupies a simple hut on the edge of Stepney City Farm in London\u2019s East End. There\u2019s mismatched furniture, games of Jenga and Scrabble on the tables, and an awful lot of peace. I suspect it would be a calming space in which to linger in any circumstances, but chefs Alice Wilson and Matt Hall are busily providing a whole bunch of edible reasons for going there in the first place. The Humble Bee feels like a place where nothing bad can happen, and keep not happening. The city-farm setting is key. So far, it\u2019s providing just 15% of the ingredients, but will, in time, provide much more. There are those who will tell you that places like this are a solution to the apparent iniquities of Big Food Retail, with capital letters; of long supply chains, and concrete jungles so far from the fields; that we could all eat local if only we put our minds to it, and lifted the paving stones to find the dark fertile earth beneath. It\u2019s a sweet fantasy, though a fantasy all the same. The proponents of practical urban farming always seem to underestimate the true scale of the demand for food in densely populated cities. None of that should detract from the vital importance of places like this. Saying city farms have educational value is like saying a glass of water will quench your thirst. Of course they do. There are arts and training projects here for people with disabilities; regularly the paths throng with visits by schools. It is space in which the old skills are kept alive. But there are other less tangible virtues to do with simple wellbeing and an environment that has been nurtured into life for the past 40 years by the local community. The farm has returned the favour, by nurturing the community within which it sits. On these three acres they grow giant pumpkins and broad beans, beetroots and garlic, redcurrants, rhubarb and so much more besides. There are farm animals, too, including pigs, sheep, ducks and geese, kept not as pets for children merely to coo over, although there is a bit of that. The animals are bred for market. It is a working farm with a purpose. On an early autumn day, with the warm sun now a little lower in the sky, and the foliage starting to sag with weight from a long, exhausting summer of frenetic growth, the rest of the city beyond the gates feels a very long way away. Wilson and Hall, who have worked everywhere from high-end restaurants through community caf\u00e9s to food banks, met at the Borough Market outpost of steak mavens Hawksmoor. There is a little meat on the menu here, some of it from the animals kept on the farm. Breakfasts do offer a bacon sandwich. But for the most part the menu scribbled on the blackboard goes the way of the vegetable. What defines it all is the attention to the fundamentals. Today for \u00a36.50, there is a salad of both roasted and pickled fennel, with the caramelised, nutty bite of roasted Jerusalem artichokes, heaps of soft green lentils and cherry tomatoes bursting from their skins. For a dab of colour there are a few purple blooms. It\u2019s a big, thoughtful bowl of the good things. Most of the rest of the menu looks like a bunch of open sandwiches, each at a little over a fiver. Then they turn up and it becomes clear that the thick slice of sourdough underneath \u2013 from Rockstar Bakers in Herne Hill \u2013 while part of the offering, is essentially a platform, upon which the kitchen assembles its ideas. You can measure the depth of these \u201csandwiches\u201d with a long ruler. One comes spread thickly with their own punchy hummus. On top are slabs of roasted butternut squash, like crescent suns, their bright orange set against the crimson of pickled beetroot. There are torn basil leaves and, for a salty kick, cairns of crumbled feta. On another, feta is whipped to smooth and invited to play tag with dollops of spiced baba ganoush. Texture comes from roasted tomatoes and the peppery intent of watercress. Their take on egg mayonnaise is simply outrageous. The chickens must have worked overtime to stack this one serving.

      "body": "<p>Disabled children have been \u201cairbrushed\u201d out of bestselling children\u2019s fiction for more than a century in order to present an unrealistic version of the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/david-baddiel\" title=\"\">David Baddiel</a> has said.</p> <p>The comedian and children\u2019s author criticised popular modern children\u2019s books for featuring fewer disabled characters than were portrayed during the Victorian era, when children with disabilities often starred in bestselling novels, such as Tiny Tim in Charles Dickens\u2019s <em>A Christmas Carol</em>.</p> <p>Over the past 12 months, only one book in the top 100 bestselling children\u2019s fiction titles explicitly referred to \u201cdisability\u201d and stated this in the descriptions provided by publishers, according to data from <a href=\"https://nielsenbook.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Nielsen Book</a> research shared exclusively with the <em>Observer</em>. That book, about an amputee bank robber, was <em>Bad Dad </em>by David Walliams. Baddiel, who has just written his own novel starring a disabled child, said that among bestselling children\u2019s stories \u201cdisabled characters aren\u2019t represented enough, which is not just an issue for disabled people. In my opinion, it\u2019s an issue for all children.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cLeaving [disabled people] out of children\u2019s understanding of the world is wrong ethically and socially \u2013 and in terms of storytelling, because children do know what the world is like.\u201d</p> <p>At the Observer\u2019s request,<strong> </strong>Nielsen conducted research and found that just 165 (or 0.2%) of the 77,000 children\u2019s fiction titles sold in the past 12 months had the words \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cdisability\u201d in the description from the publishers. Nielsen also analysed the data it holds<strong> </strong>about all the children\u2019s fiction titles published since 1898 and found just 708 books containing these keywords in the publishers\u2019 descriptions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"14ea67eea9b06bc9b892dba6eaad21d846e07350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14ea67eea9b06bc9b892dba6eaad21d846e07350/0_190_3500_4372/801.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Cratchit carries Tiny Tim on his shoulders \u2013 both are characters from \u2018A Christmas Carol\u2019 by Charles Dickens.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Cratchit carries Tiny Tim on his shoulders \u2013 both are characters from \u2018A Christmas Carol\u2019 by Charles Dickens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead of excluding disabled characters from stories, which Baddiel describes as a \u201cweird convention\u201d of many children\u2019s books, writers should be helping children understand that disabled people are not defined by their disability. \u201cSomewhere in the children\u2019s book universe, there exists a very old-fashioned notion that we mustn\u2019t sully children\u2019s innocence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of teaching children about the world. It\u2019s about reflecting the real experiences a child might have.\u201d Baddiel was speaking ahead of the publication this month of his sixth novel for children, <em>The Taylor Turbochaser</em>. It stars Amy Taylor, an 11-year-old disabled petrolhead who transforms her motorised wheelchair into Baddiel\u2019s version of the batmobile, but with added fish tanks, and drives her friends to Scotland on a cowpat-fuelled adventure.</p> <p>Like Baddiel\u2019s other children\u2019s books, <em>The Taylor Turbochaser </em>is a story about a child whose wish comes true \u2013 not a novel about having a disability. And, unlike the disabled children in popular children\u2019s classics such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/may/27/review-johanna-spyri-heidi\" title=\"\">Heidi</a> </em>and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/apr/12/review-frances-hodgson-burnett-the-secret-garden\" title=\"\">The Secret Garden,</a></em> who miraculously learn to walk after they get some fresh air, Amy remains in her wheelchair at the end of the story. It is her unhappy, divorced dad who is healed most by her journey.</p> <p>Baddiel was inspired by his memories of playing at driving his father\u2019s Triumph Spitfire. He decided to write a novel about a child who could actually drive \u2013 and the idea of a disabled girl who wanted to \u201cpimp her ride\u201d popped into his head.</p> <p>\u201cOnce I had that story idea, nothing could hold me back. The idea that you might not put a disabled character in a children\u2019s book because of some weird convention \u2013 I don\u2019t understand the point of that. You make your story richer by including diversity of experience. And, also, it\u2019s real.\u201d</p> <p>He acknowledged that there must be books he doesn\u2019t know about that do star disabled characters and that some less famous writers may be more fearful about breaking conventions in case it alienates publishers or parents, and he feels lucky he can write about what he wants to. \u201cBecause I am a bestselling author, I have a certain licence.\u201d</p> <p>A report by the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/19/whats-taking-so-long-childrens-books-still-neglect-bame-readers-finds-study\" title=\"\">earlier this month</a> further criticised the lack of diversity in children\u2019s books. It found just 4% of new children\u2019s books contain a minority-ethnic hero, and only 7% featured any BAME characters at all. The proportion of minority-ethnic pupils at UK schools is 33%.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/13/highly-concerning-picture-books-bias-worsens-as-female-characters-stay-silent\" title=\"\">Similar research,</a> carried out by Guardian Books on the top 100 bestselling children\u2019s picture books earlier this year, found that only five featured a BAME character in a central role. Only one included a disabled character, and she did not speak or play a main role in the story.</p> <p>Other popular authors, such as Katherine Rundell, have also included disabled characters in their novels over the past year, and forthcoming titles from publishers suggest that in 2020 more writers will follow suit. In February, Walker Books will publish <em>The Good Hawk,</em> set in an alternative post-apocalyptic Scotland. One of the lead characters has Down\u2019s syndrome. In April, Canongate will publish <em>The Infinite,</em> starring an autistic girl who is obsessed with numbers and can time travel.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 September and 1 October 2019: to give more detail about the parameters of the Nielsen research; and to clarify that Baddiel had noted during the interview that there would be in existence inclusive children\u2019s books of which he was unaware.</p>",

Nielsen also analysed the data it holds about all the children\u2019s fiction titles published since 1898 and found just 708 books containing these keywords in the publishers\u2019 descriptions. Instead of excluding disabled characters from stories, which Baddiel describes as a \u201cweird convention\u201d of many children\u2019s books, writers should be helping children understand that disabled people are not defined by their disability. \u201cSomewhere in the children\u2019s book universe, there exists a very old-fashioned notion that we mustn\u2019t sully children\u2019s innocence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of teaching children about the world. It\u2019s about reflecting the real experiences a child might have.\u201d Baddiel was speaking ahead of the publication this month of his sixth novel for children, The Taylor Turbochaser. It stars Amy Taylor, an 11-year-old disabled petrolhead who transforms her motorised wheelchair into Baddiel\u2019s version of the batmobile, but with added fish tanks, and drives her friends to Scotland on a cowpat-fuelled adventure. Like Baddiel\u2019s other children\u2019s books, The Taylor Turbochaser is a story about a child whose wish comes true \u2013 not a novel about having a disability. And, unlike the disabled children in popular children\u2019s classics such as Heidi and The Secret Garden, who miraculously learn to walk after they get some fresh air, Amy remains in her wheelchair at the end of the story. It is her unhappy, divorced dad who is healed most by her journey. Baddiel was inspired by his memories of playing at driving his father\u2019s Triumph Spitfire. He decided to write a novel about a child who could actually drive \u2013 and the idea of a disabled girl who wanted to \u201cpimp her ride\u201d popped into his head. \u201cOnce I had that story idea, nothing could hold me back. The idea that you might not put a disabled character in a children\u2019s book because of some weird convention \u2013 I don\u2019t understand the point of that. You make your story richer by including diversity of experience. And, also, it\u2019s real.\u201d He acknowledged that there must be books he doesn\u2019t know about that do star disabled characters and that some less famous writers may be more fearful about breaking conventions in case it alienates publishers or parents, and he feels lucky he can write about what he wants to. \u201cBecause I am a bestselling author, I have a certain licence.\u201d A report by the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education earlier this month further criticised the lack of diversity in children\u2019s books. It found just 4% of new children\u2019s books contain a minority-ethnic hero, and only 7% featured any BAME characters at all. The proportion of minority-ethnic pupils at UK schools is 33%. Similar research, carried out by Guardian Books on the top 100 bestselling children\u2019s picture books earlier this year, found that only five featured a BAME character in a central role. Only one included a disabled character, and she did not speak or play a main role in the story. Other popular authors, such as Katherine Rundell, have also included disabled characters in their novels over the past year, and forthcoming titles from publishers suggest that in 2020 more writers will follow suit. In February, Walker Books will publish The Good Hawk, set in an alternative post-apocalyptic Scotland. One of the lead characters has Down\u2019s syndrome. In April, Canongate will publish The Infinite, starring an autistic girl who is obsessed with numbers and can time travel. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 September and 1 October 2019: to give more detail about the parameters of the Nielsen research; and to clarify that Baddiel had noted during the interview that there would be in existence inclusive children\u2019s books of which he was unaware.",

Her new album, <strong><a href=\"https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/8658353--iberia-y-francia\" title=\"\">Iberia y Francia</a></strong> (Chandos), takes a different direction: the French composers Ravel and Debussy are matched with their Spanish near contemporaries De Falla, Alb\u00e9niz and Mompou, displaying the elusive but audible musical resonances between the two cultures. As Cooper writes, the connections are \u201cmore felt than proven\u201d.</p> <p>Ravel, born in the French Basque region just a long walk from the Spanish border, is represented by the Pavane pour une infante d\u00e9funte and Alborada del gracioso. Cooper gives vitality and style to four pieces from Alb\u00e9niz\u2019s hot, atmospheric <em>Iberia</em> suite and two <em>Canci\u00f3n y Danza</em> by Mompou. A favourite from this recital disc is her account of Debussy\u2019s L\u2019isle joyeuse, played with crystalline precision and dreamy freedom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bc0ac2a8912809aa9597db3a833b078e93f38c8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc0ac2a8912809aa9597db3a833b078e93f38c8c/0_0_2390_3000/797.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Tyson American pianist\" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Tyson American pianist</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Steiner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 For complementary listening, a Spanish thread runs through Andrew Tyson\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/8655961--landscapes\" title=\"\">Landscapes: Scarlatti, Schubert, Alb\u00e9niz, Mompou</a></strong> (Alpha Classics). The <a href=\"https://www.andrewtysonpiano.com/\" title=\"\">young American pianist</a>, fast making a name, explores ideas of landscape, like Cooper driven by instinct and musical sense rather than anything more literal. Four sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti frame Schubert\u2019s early Sonata in A, D664, Alb\u00e9niz\u2019s<em> Iberia</em>, <em>Book 1</em> and Mompou\u2019s three Paisajes, inspired by Barcelona, the composer\u2019s home city. Tyson\u2019s playing in the Scarlatti is crisp and incisive, his Schubert buoyant and unburdened by melancholy, his Alb\u00e9niz poetic and seductive. He and Cooper overlap on only one piece: Alb\u00e9niz\u2019s Evocaci\u00f3n, his febrile, hers more languid.

      "bodyText": "\u2022 The British pianist Imogen Cooper, among the most versatile and lyrical of performers, has been associated with exploratory Schubert cycles, with Liszt, Brahms, Schumann, Mozart, all authoritatively committed to disc. Her new album, Iberia y Francia (Chandos), takes a different direction: the French composers Ravel and Debussy are matched with their Spanish near contemporaries De Falla, Alb\u00e9niz and Mompou, displaying the elusive but audible musical resonances between the two cultures. As Cooper writes, the connections are \u201cmore felt than proven\u201d. Ravel, born in the French Basque region just a long walk from the Spanish border, is represented by the Pavane pour une infante d\u00e9funte and Alborada del gracioso. Cooper gives vitality and style to four pieces from Alb\u00e9niz\u2019s hot, atmospheric Iberia suite and two Canci\u00f3n y Danza by Mompou. A favourite from this recital disc is her account of Debussy\u2019s L\u2019isle joyeuse, played with crystalline precision and dreamy freedom. \u2022 For complementary listening, a Spanish thread runs through Andrew Tyson\u2019s Landscapes: Scarlatti, Schubert, Alb\u00e9niz, Mompou (Alpha Classics). The young American pianist, fast making a name, explores ideas of landscape, like Cooper driven by instinct and musical sense rather than anything more literal. Four sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti frame Schubert\u2019s early Sonata in A, D664, Alb\u00e9niz\u2019s Iberia, Book 1 and Mompou\u2019s three Paisajes, inspired by Barcelona, the composer\u2019s home city. Tyson\u2019s playing in the Scarlatti is crisp and incisive, his Schubert buoyant and unburdened by melancholy, his Alb\u00e9niz poetic and seductive. He and Cooper overlap on only one piece: Alb\u00e9niz\u2019s Evocaci\u00f3n, his febrile, hers more languid. Two pianists, two contrasting styles, both entirely persuasive. \u2022 Radio 3 this week focuses on the music and culture of Al-Andalus. Hannah French is joined by musicologist Jonathan Shannon and Islamic art historian Sabiha al Khemir on The Early Music Show (today, 12 noon). Words and Music: Al-Andalus, Nights in the Gardens of Spain (today, 5.30pm) visits Granada and the Alhambra.",

      "bodyText": "The Politician (Netflix) The $50 Million Art Swindle (BBC Two) | iPlayer The Conspiracy Files: Vaccine Wars (BBC Two) | iPlayer Peaky Blinders (BBC One) | iPlayer A Confession (ITV1) | ITV Hub While very little could reasonably compete with the grand guignol unfolding on our daily screens \u2013 I assume Peter Morgan is even now sharpening pencils for the two-hour comic drama Balmoral, or The One in Which the Queen Gets \u201cLied\u201d To \u2013 Netflix at least had a stab at reflecting how one man\u2019s lust for power can lead, with dreary inevitability, to insanely tangled webs, venality and cynicism. And the kind of hubris, the seed of destruction, a man carries within him from birth, ancient as original sin. In The Politician, Payton wants to be president. Of the US, of course \u2013 but first he\u2019ll settle for student body president. It helps for the aesthetics that, as a school in a wealthy Santa Barbara \u2019burb, rather than an Appalachian backwood where everyone wears twigs, it\u2019s easy on the eye. It also features a stellar cast \u2013 Ben Platt, Gwynnie Paltrow, Jessica Lange, January Jones, Bette Midler \u2013 and carries itself along splendidly on wings of style, wit and viciousness. Showrunner Ryan Murphy (Glee, Feud) has pulled off the neat trick of remorselessly bashing achingly PC millennial sensibilities while celebrating the warmth of the individuals involved. John Hughes managed something similar, if less snarky, with the \u201cbrat pack\u201d 30-odd years ago. And so Payton, and various rivals, compete in these newly \u201cwoke\u201d days for running mates. Endlessly watchable, it goes to the heart of politics itself. Already it\u2019s been commissioned for a whole new series, which will see our antihero in a grownup proper battle for real votes. And Payton, despite his multifarious drawbacks \u2013 a sense of high entitlement, an absence of authenticity or ability to feel empathy, plus he\u2019s just not that clever or even that cunning \u2013 has you, somehow, rooting for him throughout. But never mind the full plot: this is worth the watching for the sideswipes alone. I was bizarrely disappointed, given the body of her previous work, in Vanessa Engle\u2019s The $50 Million Art Swindle, the outre tale of Michel (or Michael, depending on whom he was trying to impress) Cohen. Who garnered much trust in the New York and LA art markets, became utterly addicted (and millions in debt) to stock trading, used his art pull to finagle wire transfers, selling (say) one Picasso five times over to (say) Swiss buyers \u2013 and, when the balls got too numerous to juggle, fled NY in panic for Rio. Jailed, he escaped, crossed the Amazon to Guyana, made it back to rural France, where he now lives anonymously, on benefits, reunited with wife and sons. Part of my disappointment stemmed surely from so much pre-publicity: if I read one puff piece in last week\u2019s supplements for how Engle had tracked down Cohen where Interpol and hired hitmen had failed I must have read a full two dozen: when the BBC hype machine gets wind of a Thomas Crown-style global chase, it doesn\u2019t know how to let go. After so much ramping up, it was almost bound to fall short. And I know that, technically, this wasn\u2019t a victimless crime, but it was also rather hard to care much about the rich dupes. Cohen, on the other hand, had lost it all (his family must have the stoicism of saints, presumably forbearing for ever to mention their previous NY affluence, the horses and the Steinways). Had I stumbled across this documentary unheralded (so often less is more), I would have stumbled on a fascinating tale of a good man gone addicted, though with a differing interpretation of \u201ctheft\u201d than Engle\u2019s: he insisted they were just \u201cloans\u201d, which he still intends to pay back. On benefits, in rural France, and it\u2019s $50m and change. The Conspiracy Files: Vaccine Wars gave a fair crack of the whip to both sides in the debate, which was good of them given that there\u2019s only one side for any but the feeble-minded to be on. We saw some morons, some even elected, reacting to various rulings (as did \u201cDr\u201d Andrew Wakefield) as simply proof that there was a conspiracy against them and therefore an excuse to double down on the lies.

I don\u2019t necessarily wish to get all Jo Swinson-antidemocratic on any of your asses, but the prospect of mandatory vaccination must now loom. Peaky Blinders played a blinder in its season close, and as ever it was a double header between Tommy (Cillian Murphy) and Alfie Solomons (Tom Hardy) that stole and haunted the eyes: in a seedy Margate back room, those seven minutes mesmerised. Never mind the substance, feel the style. Roll on season six and, most likely, seven. In one of which Arthur is almost bound to sack his anger management counsellor. Or shoot them.

Outside, he allowed himself a ruminative twitch of the head, a puff of the cheeks: the equivalent in any other soul of a leaping ankle tap and jazz hands. And then it all went bin fire-wrong, Brexit-wrong. Quite how the tricksier niceties of the 1984 Pace Act could have enthralled us for a full hour is thanks entirely to the quality of writer Jeff Pope and the acting talent before us: Freeman, certainly, but also Joe Absolom, playing a squirrelly killer in ways they wouldn\u2019t recognise down in Doc Martin\u2019s Portwenn, and Siobhan Finneran and, notably, Imelda Staunton.

As such, there\u2019s little room here for questions like \u201cwhat\u2019s the big single, lads?\u201d \u2013 though Aibophobia, a palindromic puzzle with instrumental parts learned and recorded, Twin Peaks-style, in reverse before being replayed forward, or Couch Combover, with its staccato postpunk riffs and uneasily catchy refrains about fly-swatters and bath-bombs, stand out. It\u2019s the terror of tracks like Laggard, with its self-destruct siren synths, distant dinosaur screams and erratic, tumbling drums, though, that stay with you long after you escape the twisting corridors of Ballintubbert House.",

      "body": "<p>Can a leopard change its spots, asks Israeli film-maker Guy Nattiv in this troublingly slick drama, based on the true story of Bryon Widner, a reformed US white supremacist who had two years of painful laser treatment to remove the racist tattoos that covered his body and face. The already anxious, clattering sound design is punctuated by the violent puff of the laser gun.</p> <p>There are inklings that Jamie Bell\u2019s Widner might not be like the other skinheads; he cares for his dog and plays family man to single mother Julie (Danielle Macdonald). It\u2019s this new relationship that makes him think twice about knifing black kids and torching mosques as a member of the racist Vinlanders Social Club and so the film follows his attempts to extricate himself from his \u201cfamily\u201d.</p> <p>Bell is magnetic in the role, and there\u2019s real chemistry between him and Macdonald, but the film\u2019s formal glossiness and frequent overhead shots create distance between the viewer and the hate crimes on display.

      "bodyText": "Can a leopard change its spots, asks Israeli film-maker Guy Nattiv in this troublingly slick drama, based on the true story of Bryon Widner, a reformed US white supremacist who had two years of painful laser treatment to remove the racist tattoos that covered his body and face. The already anxious, clattering sound design is punctuated by the violent puff of the laser gun. There are inklings that Jamie Bell\u2019s Widner might not be like the other skinheads; he cares for his dog and plays family man to single mother Julie (Danielle Macdonald). It\u2019s this new relationship that makes him think twice about knifing black kids and torching mosques as a member of the racist Vinlanders Social Club and so the film follows his attempts to extricate himself from his \u201cfamily\u201d. Bell is magnetic in the role, and there\u2019s real chemistry between him and Macdonald, but the film\u2019s formal glossiness and frequent overhead shots create distance between the viewer and the hate crimes on display. The film works hard to complicate the character of Widner, but flattens the pernicious culture that formed him.",

On the eve of the ceremony marking establishment of the People\u2019s Republic on 1 October that year, the then 27-year-old page editor at the <em>People\u2019s Daily</em> worked through the night to ensure the paper would come out without a glitch. The next day he joined the celebrations with his colleagues, while his wife stayed at home with their baby.</p> <p>The streets were filled with the sound of people chatting and singing. With the five-star red national flags billowing, hundreds of thousands of people waited for hours before Mao Zedong appeared on the balcony of the Gate of Heavenly Peace to announce the founding of the PRC. \u201cWe were so excited. We thought: at last, the Chinese people are united,\u201d said He, now 97. His first article after the founding day was headlined \u201cFrom darkness into brightness\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a decade of civil war before ... so we were looking forward to building a democratic and peaceful China under a coalition government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Tuesday, China will mark the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/no-drones-drinking-or-dissent-china-lays-down-law-ahead-of-70th-anniversary\" title=\"\">70th anniversary of the founding of the communist regime</a> with fireworks and a massive military parade to showcase legions of troops and its latest weaponry, much like the one attended by the young journalist. But for He the show of national strength will lead to reflections on his lost dreams of a democratic China.</p> <p>The early years of the PRC\u2019s coalition government consisted of several political parties under the leadership of the Communists guided by the principle of Mao\u2019s \u201cnew democracy\u201d. During that phase the Communist party was supposed to share power before advancing on to socialism and finally communism. \u201cThe ideas of the Communist party\u2019s new democracy and a coalition government won over us,\u201d said He, with a tinge of sadness in his voice. \u201cWe really had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/29/chaos-hope-change-stories-from-70-years-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china\" title=\"\">great hopes for new China</a>, but the result wasn\u2019t quite what we expected,\u201d said He.</p> <p>As a teenager, He had loathed the corrupt and dictatorial rule under the Nationalist party before 1949. With ideals of fraternity, freedom and equality in mind, he and many other young people saw the Communists as the answer to the salvation of China, as championed by Mao and the party propagandists in the 1940s.</p> <p>From 1943 to 1946, the Communist party mouthpiece Xinhua Daily had an editorial every year on 4 July, America\u2019s Independence Day, praising democratic ideals. In interviews with foreign journalists, Mao praised President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s advocacy of four freedoms, particularly the freedom from fear and freedom of speech.</p> <p>\u201cWe thought when the Communist party was in power it would follow the US democratic path. We genuinely believed that Mao would implement it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after people gain power, it\u2019s easy to become dictatorial.\u201d</p> <p>He got involved with the Communist party because of his democratic ideals. Under the National party, when communist sympathisers were harshly oppressed, 18-year-old He and his friends formed an underground reading group to study pro-democracy publications. After he went to study journalism in 1943 at the prestigious Fudan University, then based in the southwestern city of Chongqing during the Sino-Japanese war, he and his girlfriend (who became his wife) helped set up a student newspaper which acted as a front for clandestine communist activities.</p> <p>After their names got on the Nationalist government\u2019s blacklist, they escaped to the nearest communist base in July 1946, where they joined the newly founded People\u2019s Daily \u2013 then operating secretly in the rural part of the northern province of Hebei. They even changed their names to protect their families \u2013 to this day, he still uses He Yanling, his adopted name. They became party members a year later.A few years after the regime took over, Mao began to abandon his new democracy principles. Political movements such as the \u201cthought reform\u201d campaign and anti-rightism of the 1950s, which attacked intellectuals as bourgeois class enemies, the Great Leap Forward in 1958 \u2013 a radical agricultural campaign that led to 40 million people starving to death \u2013 and the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976 blighted the lives of millions of ordinary people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab0dde7c5feb89e4265f7c2c17cd9c466f1b98cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab0dde7c5feb89e4265f7c2c17cd9c466f1b98cc/0_148_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tiananmen Square protests, June 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tiananmen Square, June 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Widener/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He and his wife, Song Zheng, were implicated in 1959 in the \u201canti-right opportunist campaign\u201d for having reported about people starving to death and party cadres\u2019 abuse of power during the Great Leap Forward in rural China. In the Cultural Revolution, he was castigated as a \u201ccounter-revolution revisionist\u201d and \u201ccapitalist roader\u201d and put under detention. \u201cFor more than two decades, there was no productivity and no improvement of people\u2019s lives \u2013 that wasn\u2019t socialism,\u201d He sighed.</p> <p>\u201cMao had a big ego and wouldn\u2019t admit to his mistakes. He suppressed voices of discontent to uphold his ruling position. He launched class struggles, and people who disagreed with him were cast as dissidents from hostile classes. Things developed into the Cultural Revolution, and even he lost control over that.\u201d</p> <p>Mao died in 1976, and the tumultuous decade of chaos came to an end. In 1978 the reformist leader Hu Yaobang began to rehabilitate political victims and the party began a programme of political and economic liberalisation. Hu\u2019s death sparked the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement, which ended in a bloody military crackdown on 4 June 1989.</p> <p>He said he \u201calmost completely lost hope\u201d over the brutality of the crushing of students and ordinary people who were calling for democracy, but was also worried about the future of political and economic reforms. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t lose hope completely, because most people in the party were opposed to it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>After He and his wife retired, they and two other retired state media journalists spent nearly two decades researching historical archives and interviewing people like themselves who risked their lives as idealistic students under the Nationalist party to advocate communism before 1949.</p> <p>This resulted in three volumes of books, with the last volume unable to be published in China because of the candid chronicling of the tragic fates of former underground party members who suffered in countless political movements under the Communist regime. Many intellectuals were banished to hard labour in the countryside for their \u201cbourgeois\u201d and \u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d political stance.</p> <p>Reflecting on his life, He said he didn\u2019t feel cheated by the Communist party, like some people from his generation. He said he and many in the party had been shocked when Mao abandoned his New Democracy principles in 1952, but he had gone along with it and had even believed that some sacrifices of freedoms under Mao\u2019s \u201csocialist transformation\u201d drive were justified.</p> <p>\u201cI too had doubts \u2026 but Mao enjoyed a supreme status in new China and the cult of personality was strong. People who expressed doubts were seen as \u2018lagging behind\u2019,\u201d He said.</p> <p>Seventy years on, He is philosophical about his lost dreams of democracy and freedom. While he does not like the tightening of ideological control that has happened over recent years, He feels it is the authorities\u2019 response to China finding itself in an increasingly complex international order.</p> <p>In view of the rise of nationalism and unilateralism, as well as economic crises in the west, which young idealists like him looked up to for democratic inspiration in the 1940s, He believes its \u201cinitial glitz of democratic spirit has been slowing and tarnishing\u201d while China\u2019s power has been rising. \u201cAs to what is genuine freedom and democracy,\u201d he said, \u201cthe absolute standard has been lost.\u201d</p> <h2>Seventy years of turbulence <br></h2> <p><strong>1949</strong> Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. </p> <p><strong>1950-51</strong> The campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries begins.</p> <p><strong>1953-1956</strong> Mao implements socialist transition, abandoning his promises of \u201cnew democracy\u201d.</p> <p><strong>1957</strong> The \u201canti-rightist movement\u201d purges at least 550,000 people, mostly intellectuals with liberal economic and political views.</p> <p><strong>1958-1961</strong> The Great Leap Forward leads to 40 million people starving to death.</p> <p><strong>1966-1976</strong> The Cultural Revolution produces massive upheaval and unleashes unprecedented brutality.

Under the National party, when communist sympathisers were harshly oppressed, 18-year-old He and his friends formed an underground reading group to study pro-democracy publications. After he went to study journalism in 1943 at the prestigious Fudan University, then based in the southwestern city of Chongqing during the Sino-Japanese war, he and his girlfriend (who became his wife) helped set up a student newspaper which acted as a front for clandestine communist activities. After their names got on the Nationalist government\u2019s blacklist, they escaped to the nearest communist base in July 1946, where they joined the newly founded People\u2019s Daily \u2013 then operating secretly in the rural part of the northern province of Hebei. They even changed their names to protect their families \u2013 to this day, he still uses He Yanling, his adopted name. They became party members a year later.A few years after the regime took over, Mao began to abandon his new democracy principles. Political movements such as the \u201cthought reform\u201d campaign and anti-rightism of the 1950s, which attacked intellectuals as bourgeois class enemies, the Great Leap Forward in 1958 \u2013 a radical agricultural campaign that led to 40 million people starving to death \u2013 and the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976 blighted the lives of millions of ordinary people. He and his wife, Song Zheng, were implicated in 1959 in the \u201canti-right opportunist campaign\u201d for having reported about people starving to death and party cadres\u2019 abuse of power during the Great Leap Forward in rural China. In the Cultural Revolution, he was castigated as a \u201ccounter-revolution revisionist\u201d and \u201ccapitalist roader\u201d and put under detention. \u201cFor more than two decades, there was no productivity and no improvement of people\u2019s lives \u2013 that wasn\u2019t socialism,\u201d He sighed. \u201cMao had a big ego and wouldn\u2019t admit to his mistakes. He suppressed voices of discontent to uphold his ruling position. He launched class struggles, and people who disagreed with him were cast as dissidents from hostile classes. Things developed into the Cultural Revolution, and even he lost control over that.\u201d Mao died in 1976, and the tumultuous decade of chaos came to an end. In 1978 the reformist leader Hu Yaobang began to rehabilitate political victims and the party began a programme of political and economic liberalisation. Hu\u2019s death sparked the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement, which ended in a bloody military crackdown on 4 June 1989. He said he \u201calmost completely lost hope\u201d over the brutality of the crushing of students and ordinary people who were calling for democracy, but was also worried about the future of political and economic reforms. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t lose hope completely, because most people in the party were opposed to it,\u201d he said. After He and his wife retired, they and two other retired state media journalists spent nearly two decades researching historical archives and interviewing people like themselves who risked their lives as idealistic students under the Nationalist party to advocate communism before 1949. This resulted in three volumes of books, with the last volume unable to be published in China because of the candid chronicling of the tragic fates of former underground party members who suffered in countless political movements under the Communist regime. Many intellectuals were banished to hard labour in the countryside for their \u201cbourgeois\u201d and \u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d political stance. Reflecting on his life, He said he didn\u2019t feel cheated by the Communist party, like some people from his generation. He said he and many in the party had been shocked when Mao abandoned his New Democracy principles in 1952, but he had gone along with it and had even believed that some sacrifices of freedoms under Mao\u2019s \u201csocialist transformation\u201d drive were justified. \u201cI too had doubts \u2026 but Mao enjoyed a supreme status in new China and the cult of personality was strong. People who expressed doubts were seen as \u2018lagging behind\u2019,\u201d He said. Seventy years on, He is philosophical about his lost dreams of democracy and freedom. While he does not like the tightening of ideological control that has happened over recent years, He feels it is the authorities\u2019 response to China finding itself in an increasingly complex international order. In view of the rise of nationalism and unilateralism, as well as economic crises in the west, which young idealists like him looked up to for democratic inspiration in the 1940s, He believes its \u201cinitial glitz of democratic spirit has been slowing and tarnishing\u201d while China\u2019s power has been rising. \u201cAs to what is genuine freedom and democracy,\u201d he said, \u201cthe absolute standard has been lost.\u201d Seventy years of turbulence 1949 Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 1950-51 The campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries begins. 1953-1956 Mao implements socialist transition, abandoning his promises of \u201cnew democracy\u201d. 1957 The \u201canti-rightist movement\u201d purges at least 550,000 people, mostly intellectuals with liberal economic and political views. 1958-1961 The Great Leap Forward leads to 40 million people starving to death. 1966-1976 The Cultural Revolution produces massive upheaval and unleashes unprecedented brutality. Up to two million people are killed. 1976 Mao dies. The cause of his death is not known. 1978 Political and economic liberalisation. Tens of thousands of Cultural Revolution victims are rehabilitated. 1989 Pro-democracy protests by students and workers in Tiananmen Square in Beijing end on 4 June after a military crackdown that kills an estimated 10,000. 2008 Protests erupt across Tibet, triggering a crackdown. 2012 Xi Jinping takes over as Communist party chief and assumes the presidency in March 2013. 2014 Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cumbrella movement\u201d protests against Beijing\u2019s plans to vet candidates for elections in 2017. 2015 China ends the one-child policy imposed in the 1970s. 2018 China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress votes to remove a two-term limit on the presidency from the country\u2019s constitution, allowing Xi Jinping to remain in office indefinitely. 2019 A controversial extradition bill sparks a wave of anti-government protests in Hong Kong.",
