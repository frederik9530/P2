      "body": "<p>A record number of antisemitic incidents has been recorded in the UK for the first six months of this year by the <a href=\"https://cst.org.uk/about-cst/mission-statement\">Community Security Trust</a>.</p> \n<p>There were 892 reported incidents between January and June, a 10% increase on the same period of 2018 \u2013 which also had a record high \u2013 said the CST, a charity that monitors antisemitism and provides security for the British Jewish community.</p> \n<p>More than a third of the incidents involved social media, again a significantly higher proportion than in 2018. The CST said the data was likely to understate the scale of the problem, as campaigns directed at individuals could comprise hundreds or even thousands of tweets, images or posts within a concentrated timespan, but be recorded by the trust as a single incident.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is the third year in a row that CST has seen an increase in reports of antisemitic incidents,\u201d said David Delew, the trust\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe problem is spreading across the country and online. It reflects deepening divisions in our society and it is causing increasing anxiety in the Jewish community. It will take people of all communities and backgrounds standing together to turn this tide of hate around.\u201d</p> \n<p>Almost two-thirds of the incidents took place in Greater London and Greater Manchester, home to the two largest Jewish populations in the UK. But there was a fall of about 1% in incidents in those two areas, whereas in other places, in Hertfordshire, Merseyside, Gateshead, Leeds, Birmingham and Wales, the trust recorded an increase.</p> \n<p>The number of violent antisemitic assaults rose from 62 in the first half of 2018 to 85 in the same period of 2019. None were classified by the CST as \u201cextreme violence\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/07/antisemitic-incidents-uk-record-high-third-year-in-row-community-security-trust\">Antisemitic incidents in UK at record high for third year in a row</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There were 38 incidents of damage and desecration of Jewish property; 710 of abusive behaviour, including verbal abuse, graffiti, abuse via social media and one-off cases of hate mail; 49 direct threats; and 10 cases of mass-mailed leaflets or emails.</p> \n<p>Sixty-two public figures became targets, as well as 102 Jewish community organisations, events and commercial premises.</p> \n<p>The highest monthly totals were in February and March, with 182 and 169 incidents respectively. These were months when issues relating to Jews and antisemitism were prominent because of the continuing controversy over antisemitism in the Labour party, the CST said.</p> \n<p>In those two months, the trust recorded 55 incidents specifically related to allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"72ec8820-c277-41ed-a210-a8f024a48b7f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In 2016 the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) agreed this working definition of antisemitism:</p>\n    <p>\"Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\"</p>\n    <p>The IHRA definition goes on to state:</p>\n    <p>\"Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for 'why things go wrong'. It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.\"</p>\n    <p>The IHRA provides the following as examples of antisemitism:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective \u2014 such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n     <li>Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.<br>&nbsp;</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Highlighting the number of incidents relating to alleged antisemitism in the Labour party, Marie van der Zyl, president of the <a href=\"https://www.bod.org.uk/\">Board of Deputies of British Jews</a>, said: \u201cThis makes shameful reading for the party\u2019s leadership. They must finally take the steps required to rid their party of this appalling racism. Defeating the evil of antisemitism will take a concerted effort by the country\u2019s political leadership and civil society to ensure that this country remains a safe and happy place for the Jewish community.\u201d</p> \n<p>The trust has been recording antisemitic incidents since 1984, and it has shared its data with the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council since 2015.</p> \n<p>Mark Hamilton of the NPCC said: \u201cIt can never be acceptable to abuse someone because of their ethnicity or religion, but we see that there are still far too many in our society who are prepared to act illegally, fuelled by global events, divisions in our own society, or by bigoted ideologies. The police will continue to improve our services to victims and to help bring offenders to justice.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A record number of antisemitic incidents has been recorded in the UK for the first six months of this year by the Community Security Trust. There were 892 reported incidents between January and June, a 10% increase on the same period of 2018 \u2013 which also had a record high \u2013 said the CST, a charity that monitors antisemitism and provides security for the British Jewish community. More than a third of the incidents involved social media, again a significantly higher proportion than in 2018. The CST said the data was likely to understate the scale of the problem, as campaigns directed at individuals could comprise hundreds or even thousands of tweets, images or posts within a concentrated timespan, but be recorded by the trust as a single incident. \u201cThis is the third year in a row that CST has seen an increase in reports of antisemitic incidents,\u201d said David Delew, the trust\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe problem is spreading across the country and online. It reflects deepening divisions in our society and it is causing increasing anxiety in the Jewish community. It will take people of all communities and backgrounds standing together to turn this tide of hate around.\u201d Almost two-thirds of the incidents took place in Greater London and Greater Manchester, home to the two largest Jewish populations in the UK. But there was a fall of about 1% in incidents in those two areas, whereas in other places, in Hertfordshire, Merseyside, Gateshead, Leeds, Birmingham and Wales, the trust recorded an increase. The number of violent antisemitic assaults rose from 62 in the first half of 2018 to 85 in the same period of 2019. None were classified by the CST as \u201cextreme violence\u201d. There were 38 incidents of damage and desecration of Jewish property; 710 of abusive behaviour, including verbal abuse, graffiti, abuse via social media and one-off cases of hate mail; 49 direct threats; and 10 cases of mass-mailed leaflets or emails. Sixty-two public figures became targets, as well as 102 Jewish community organisations, events and commercial premises. The highest monthly totals were in February and March, with 182 and 169 incidents respectively. These were months when issues relating to Jews and antisemitism were prominent because of the continuing controversy over antisemitism in the Labour party, the CST said. In those two months, the trust recorded 55 incidents specifically related to allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party. Highlighting the number of incidents relating to alleged antisemitism in the Labour party, Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: \u201cThis makes shameful reading for the party\u2019s leadership. They must finally take the steps required to rid their party of this appalling racism. Defeating the evil of antisemitism will take a concerted effort by the country\u2019s political leadership and civil society to ensure that this country remains a safe and happy place for the Jewish community.\u201d The trust has been recording antisemitic incidents since 1984, and it has shared its data with the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council since 2015. Mark Hamilton of the NPCC said: \u201cIt can never be acceptable to abuse someone because of their ethnicity or religion, but we see that there are still far too many in our society who are prepared to act illegally, fuelled by global events, divisions in our own society, or by bigoted ideologies. The police will continue to improve our services to victims and to help bring offenders to justice.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A motorway service station overlooking the Severn Bridge has been named the worst in England after visitors criticised its unwelcoming 1960s exterior and \u201cgrim and dismal\u201d toilets. Severn View services on the M48 in Gloucestershire \u2013 near the village of Aust to the north of Bristol \u2013 attracted a customer satisfaction rating of just 72% in a survey of facilities offered by the 111 service stations across the English motorway network. Norton Canes (Roadchef) services between junctions 6 and 7 of the M6 toll road in Staffordshire was rated the best for the second year running in the survey by the independent watchdog Transport Focus. The results are published on Thursday in the watchdog\u2019s third annual Motorway Services User Survey, in which 11,600 drivers were questioned on issues such as the state of the buildings and toilets, food and drink, and staff friendliness. Overall, motorway service operators performed well: 90% of visitors said they were satisfied with the experience and facilities on offer. However, HGV drivers and others who drive for a living were the least satisfied group at 83%, down from 88% last year. Many users complained of being ripped off by overpriced food and drink. Only 59% rated the food they bought to eat on the premises as value for money \u2013 down from 66% last year, prompting calls for more variety and healthier choices.

That was basically even with the 40% who disagreed with the statement.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>There are a few ways to look at these numbers, and none are complementary to Trump. You can say that more voters believe Trump is racist than believed a segregationist running for president in 1968 was. You could be generous to Trump and say that the spread between racist and not a racist (5 points in Trump\u2019s case and 1 point in Wallace\u2019s case) is closer because more voters were undecided on Wallace. Even so, the net margin for Trump being a racist is wider than it was in Wallace\u2019s case.</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s well worth reading <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/politics/poll-trump-racist/index.html\">the whole analysis, <strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong> </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d41e8378f08c7e177d42436\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T19:43:24.780Z\">8.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ben Carson kicked off of church property in Baltimore</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ben Carson, the US Housing and Urban Development (HUD) secretary, </strong>was in Baltimore today to speak about HUD programs to help impoverished communities. </p> <p>But in the wake of Trump\u2019s racist attacks on Baltimore, Morning Star Baptist church kicked Carson off their property, where he planned to hold a press conference, <a href=\"https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/07/31/hud-secretary-ben-carson-baltimore-trump-tweets/\">reports local news station WJZ</a>. </p> <p>Gregory Evans, a member of the church, told WJZ that Carson\u2019s representatives should have spoken to the church before cleaning up the property and setting up a press conference there.

In other news: Kelly Craft has been confirmed as the new US ambassador to the United Nations. Craft has been criticized for her absenteeism from her previous post as the US envoy to Canada, and her views on climate change. Nearly half the House Democrats now support an impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump, according to an Associated Press tally on Wednesday. The number has jumped since Robert Mueller testified last week about his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate by a quarter point . The move comes after Donald Trump has applied significant pressure on the central bank to lower rates in order to stimulate economic growth. A church in Baltimore kicked Ben Carson, the US housing and urban development (Hud) secretary, off its property. A member of the church said asking Carson to leave had nothing to do with him being a member of the Trump administration. The Senate confirmed Kelly Craft to serve as Trump\u2019s ambassador to the UN. Craft succeeds Nikki Haley, who announced her resignation in October. Craft came under fire earlier this year for spending more than half her time as ambassador to Canada absent from her post. During her confirmation process Democrats expressed concerns at her family\u2019s investments in the fossil fuel industry; Craft is married to Joseph Kraft, a billionaire coal magnate from Kentucky. After initially saying in an interview that she appreciates \u201c both sides of the science\u201d on climate change, she acknowledged during her confirmation hearing that global heating was driven by human activity. However, she rejected the idea of the US re-entering the Paris climate agreement. With the second night of the Democratic debates a couple of hours away, immigrant rights protestors have blocked traffic at an international crossing between Detroit and Canada. In a press release, Carlos Rojas, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Cosecha, said: \u201cA vague commitment to support immigration reform is an empty promise that we cannot accept...We need to know that candidates are serious about solving the daily crisis undocumented workers and families have been facing for decades, and that means putting an immediate end to all detention and deportation on their first day in office\u201d Joe Biden has announced his Snapchat debut, with a splash. The account so far has featured his granddaughters. The move has been met with... skepticism. Maanvi Singh here, taking over on the West Coast. The Trump administration imposed sanctions against the Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. The Treasury department\u2019s press release said the sanctions were imposed because Zarif \u201cacted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly\u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. The move was anticipated in June when the Trump administration ordered new sanctions against Khamenei and announced that it would be levying fresh sanctions against Zarif, Iran\u2019s top diplomat, as well. In a statement, the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said: \u201cThe United States is sending a clear message to the Iranian regime that its recent behavior is completely unacceptable...Foreign Minister Javad Zarif spreads the regime\u2019s propaganda and disinformation around the world through these mediums.\u201d Tensions with Tehran have been escalating since May. Zarif responded in a tweet. Trump canceled strikes against Iran last month, which he initially ordered in retaliation for Tehran shooting down an American drone. Nearly half the House Democrats now support an impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump, according to an Associated Press tally on Wednesday. The number has jumped since Robert Mueller testified last week about his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate by a quarter point to a range of 2% to 2.25%. The move comes after Donald Trump has applied significant pressure on the central bank to lower rates in order to stimulate economic growth. In the wake of Trump\u2019s racist attacks on Baltimore, a church in the city kicked Ben Carson, the US housing and urban development (Hud) secretary, off its property. A member of the church said asking Carson to leave had nothing to do with him being a member of the Trump administration. Guardian political correspondent, Lauren Gambino, writes that tonight\u2019s debate will see Joe Biden face rival Kamala Harris in a highly anticipated rematch after a searing confrontation during last month\u2019s presidential debate. The former vice-president has also traded jabs with Bernie Sanders and Harris over healthcare, which was a major topic of debate on Tuesday night and revealed some of the sharpest divisions in the party. Harris released her version of a Medicare for All plan that would cover all Americans without abolishing private health insurance. But the California senator is likely to face questions over how she would implement such a plan without raising taxes on middle-class Americans, as she has insisted is possible. Biden, who has released a healthcare plan that would build on the Affordable Care Act passed under the Obama-Biden administration, said Harris\u2019s claim that it is possible to pay for Medicare for All without raising taxes on the middle class existed in \u201ca fantasy world\u201d. No candidate mentioned Biden on Tuesday, in a sign that despite his early lead in the primary contest, his campaign \u2013 or at least his ideas \u2013 is not dominating the field. CNN polling wizard, Harry Enten, has an analysis of a Quinnipiac University poll released this week that shows 51% of voters believe Donald Trump is a racist. Harry says that while the president\u2019s opponents might not be surprised by the results, it\u2019s a significant result because a majority of voters say the president is racist. Enten writes: Compare these numbers to a Harris poll from September 1968. Former Alabama Gov. George Wallace, a segregationist, was running for president as an opponent to the Civil Rights movement. As he campaigned, 41% agreed when asked whether Wallace was a racist. That was basically even with the 40% who disagreed with the statement. There are a few ways to look at these numbers, and none are complementary to Trump. You can say that more voters believe Trump is racist than believed a segregationist running for president in 1968 was. You could be generous to Trump and say that the spread between racist and not a racist (5 points in Trump\u2019s case and 1 point in Wallace\u2019s case) is closer because more voters were undecided on Wallace. Even so, the net margin for Trump being a racist is wider than it was in Wallace\u2019s case. It\u2019s well worth reading the whole analysis, here. Ben Carson, the US Housing and Urban Development (HUD) secretary, was in Baltimore today to speak about HUD programs to help impoverished communities. But in the wake of Trump\u2019s racist attacks on Baltimore, Morning Star Baptist church kicked Carson off their property, where he planned to hold a press conference, reports local news station WJZ. Gregory Evans, a member of the church, told WJZ that Carson\u2019s representatives should have spoken to the church before cleaning up the property and setting up a press conference there. Evans said asking Carson to leave had nothing to do with him being a member of the Trump adminstration. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the Fed cut the interest rate because of weak global growth and trade policy developments that have been disruptive to the world economy. This, though the US labour market remaining strong with the lowest unemployment rate since the late 1960s. \u201cWe see those as threats to what is clearly a favorable outlook. And we see this action as designed to support them and keep that outlook favorable,\u201d Powell said. Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign raised $1.1m after the debate last night, reports Guardian political correspondent, Lauren Gambino. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper immediately following the debate, Sanders celebrated his success with fundraising from small-dollar donors instead of the traditional campaign model of fundraising from the wealthy. \u201cI am extraordinarily proud,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI think we have broken the world\u2019s record in now having two million individual contributions at this point in the campaign, averaging all of $19 a piece. I don\u2019t think anybody has done that. I am proud of that.\u201d Because of how campaign finance laws work, there is no way to independently verify these numbers at the moment, but Sanders\u2019s campaign said he passed the two million threshold on 11 July. Last week, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign said she had received one million small-dollar contributions. As expected, the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate by a quarter point to a range of 2% to 2.25%. The Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, Richard Partington, said the interest rate cut is \u201can indication that the world\u2019s largest economy is running out of steam.\u201d The move comes after Donald Trump has applied significant pressure on the central bank to lower rates in order to stimulate economic growth. The president had called the Fed an \u201canchor wrapped around our neck\u201d and blamed rate rises last year for an unspectacular growth rate in the US. However, economists had been expecting the central bank to lower its headline rate as economic growth slows. Rising trade tensions between the US and China have served as a brake on international trade. Nearly half the House Democrats now support an impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump, according to an Associated Press tally on Wednesday. There are 113 Democrats and one Republican in the House that have publicly backed impeachment. The number has jumped since Robert Mueller testified last week about his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. \u201cSome two dozen House Democrats added their names after Mueller\u2019s appearance last week on Capitol Hill,\u201d according to the AP. This is far from the 218 votes needed to pass legislation in the House, where Democrats hold a 235-seat majority. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were the clear winners of last night\u2019s debate, with John Delaney and Marianne Williamson also getting some attention for their performance last night - not necessarily in a good way. Jeffrey Epstein appeared in Manhattan federal court later this morning, about one week after he was reportedly found unconscious in his jail cell with neck injuries. Epstein\u2019s case has drawn extensive attention, largely because of his purported ties to powerful, politically connected men, including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. The Washington National Cathedral has warned Donald Trump\u2019s words \u201cgive cover to white supremacists,\u201d in the wake of his recent attacks on minority lawmakers, Baltimore and the congressman who represents the city, Elijah Cummings. Mongolia\u2019s government has gifted the president\u2019s 13-year-old son, Barron Trump, with a horse named Victory, according to the White House. Mongolia\u2019s government frequently gifts horses to foreign dignitaries - former US defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Chuck Hagel received horses after visiting Mongolia, as did Joe Biden. An unfortunate trend is developing in the Democratic debates - no candidates mentioning Puerto Rico. In the last round of debates, Julian Castro made a passing reference to it in the second night of debates, but since then, the island\u2019s governor has been forced out of office amid protests. Mongolia\u2019s government has gifted the president\u2019s 13-year-old son, Barron Trump, with a horse named Victory, according to the White House. The horse will remain in Mongolia but the Trumps are \u201cvery grateful\u201d for the gift, said press secretary Stephanie Grisham. Mongolia\u2019s government frequently gifts horses to foreign dignitaries - former US defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Chuck Hagel received horses after visiting Mongolia. Joe Biden, the Democratic frontrunner, has also received a horse from Mongolia. Upon accepting the horse while in Mongolia in 2005, Rumsfeld declared: \u201cI am proud to be the owner of that proud animal.\u201d He named it Montana. Biden received his horse while visiting Mongolia in 2011. He named the creature Celtic. Coincidentally, Hagel also gave his horse an Irish name in 2014: Shamrock. Hagel gave it the name Shamrock because it was the mascot of the high school he graduated from, according to the New York Times. After Hagel announced the name, the Times reported: \u201cThen he turned sadly to address Shamrock. \u2018You be good while I\u2019m gone,\u2019 he said.\u201d He\u2019s back ... The president is back on Twitter, defending himself against accusations of racism by calling himself the \u201cleast racist person in the world\u201d and insulting the intelligence of one of the most prominent black TV journalists in the US. Ohio representative Tim Ryan\u2019s campaign has issued a statement about his decision to not put his hand over his heart during the national anthem at the Democratic debate last night, saying it was an accident. Congressman Ryan wasn\u2019t protesting and didn\u2019t mean to make any statement last night in Detroit, it was a moment of absentmindedness while on a debate stage that won\u2019t happen again. He was, in fact, singing along with the choir to honor our country. Congressman Ryan loves our country and will continue to honor the flag during the anthem in future events, as he has in countless events in the past. The Washington National Cathedral has warned Donald Trump\u2019s words \u201cgive cover to white supremacists,\u201d in the wake of his recent attacks on minority lawmakers, Baltimore and the congressman who represents the city, Elijah Cummings. The Washington DC-based Episcopal cathedral is one of the country\u2019s pre-eminent religious institutions and has been the site of presidential funerals, inauguration prayer services and memorials. It is not the first time the Cathedral has been critical of Trump policies, but it is certainly the most specific criticism of Trump\u2019s normal behavior. This week, President Trump crossed another threshold. Not only did he insult a leader in the fight for racial justice and equality for all persons; not only did he savage the nations from which immigrants to this country have come; but now he has condemned the residents of an entire American city. Where will he go from here? Make no mistake about it, words matter. And, Mr. Trump\u2019s words are dangerous. These words are more than a \u201cdog-whistle.\u201d When such violent dehumanizing words come from the President of the United States, they are a clarion call, and give cover, to white supremacists who consider people of color a sub-human \u201cinfestation\u201d in America. They serve as a call to action from those people to keep America great by ridding it of such infestation. Violent words lead to violent actions. When does silence become complicity? What will it take for us all to say, with one voice, that we have had enough? The question is less about the president\u2019s sense of decency, but of ours. As leaders of faith who believe in the sacredness of every single human being, the time for silence is over. We must boldly stand witness against the bigotry, hatred, intolerance, and xenophobia that is hurled at us, especially when it comes from the highest offices of this nation. We must say that this will not be tolerated. To stay silent in the face of such rhetoric is for us to tacitly condone the violence of these words. We are compelled to take every opportunity to oppose the indecency and dehumanization that is racism, whether it comes to us through words or actions. The statement was signed by Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington; the Very Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, dean of Washington National Cathedral; and the Rev. Canon Kelly Brown Douglas, canon theologian of Washington National Cathedral. With Donald Trump and UK prime minister Boris Johnson promising to reach a trade agreement to offset the economic costs of the UK leaving the EU (Brexit), US congressional leaders and diplomats have warned they can\u2019t back a plan if Brexit affects the Irish border. The Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, spoke with Republican and Democrat lawmakers about the strong bipartisan opposition to any UK trade deal in the event of a threat to the 1998 Good Friday agreement, and to the open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Pete King, the Republican co-chair of the Friends of Ireland group, said the threat to abandon the backstop and endanger the open border was a \u201cneedless provocation\u201d, adding that his party would have no compunction about defying Trump over the issue. \u201cI would think anyone who has a strong belief in Northern Ireland and the Good Friday agreement the open border would certainly be willing to go against the president,\u201d King said. In the event of a hard Brexit, in the absence of guarantees for the Northern Ireland agreement, the strength of sentiment among Irish Americans \u2013 a tenth of the population, many of them in swing states \u2013 could make it an issue in next year\u2019s presidential and congressional elections. Donald Trump is emboldening a \u201cdark psychic force\u201d in the US, declared self-help guru and Democratic hopeful Marianne Williamson last night. Williamson proved yet again to be a spring of viral moments, such as when she bluntly explained to a child reporter, that no, she does not have any pets. Before you buy a \u201cstop the dark psychic force 2020\u201d shirt, it\u2019s important to note Williamson has a terrible record when it comes to health and science. She said in June that requiring children to get vaccines is \u201cdraconian\u201d and has argued that all people should avoid treating clinical depression with medicine. That said, she emerged last night as the only candidate who actually has an outlined plan for the US to pay reparations to the descendants of the enslaved. Her response to a question about reparations, and her plan to spend $500bn to pay them, was impassioned: We need to realize that when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in America, it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with. That great injustice has to do with the fact there were 250 years of slavery followed by another 100 years of domestic terrorism. What makes me qualified to say $200 to $500 billion? I\u2019ll tell you what makes me qualified. If you did the math of the 40 acres and a mule, given that there were 4 to 5 million slaves at the end of the Civil War\u2014they were all promised 40 acres and a mule for a family of four. If you did the math today it would be trillions of dollars. And I believe that anything less than $100 billion is an insult, and I believe that $200 to $500 billion is politically feasible today, because so many Americans realize there is an injustice that continues to form a toxicity underneath the surface. Jeffrey Epstein is due to appear in Manhattan federal court later this morning, about one week after he was reportedly found unconscious in his jail cell with neck injuries. The Manhattan US Attorney\u2019s Office alleged earlier in July that Epstein \u201csexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\u201d from 2002 to 2005. Some of his victims were just 14 years-old, prosecutors also alleged. Epstein\u2019s case has drawn extensive attention, largely because of his purported ties to powerful, politically connected men, including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. The Guardian\u2019s opinion panelists are in with their assessments of last night\u2019s debate \u2013 essentially concluding it was a good night to be Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Theodore R Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, noted the debate went on for two hours before candidates mentioned black people and the specific challenges they face. And once the topic of black America finally came up, the candidates rushed to discuss their respective policy proposals that they hoped would signal their seriousness about racial equality, from the funding of black colleges to the study of reparations. But black voters know that campaign promises rarely materialize once a candidate becomes president, so one\u2019s reputation, trustworthiness, and passion tend to be what wins black support. On this score, the candidates were who we thought they were. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were the only two on stage who entered the evening with observable black support in their coalition, and it will remain that way after tonight. With Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders fending off attacks about their ambitious, left-leaning plans on Tuesday night, the rest of the Democratic field is bracing for their debate this evening. The frontrunners tonight \u2013 Joe Biden and Kamala Harris \u2013 are unlikely to face as many existential questions about how far left the Democrat party is while their competitors, like the rest of the field last night, fight for name recognition and break out moments to keep their campaign\u2019s afloat. It\u2019s been more than 12 hours since Donald Trump tweeted, which means he stayed silent through the debates. His campaign did, however, sent a blitz of emails during the event. Place your bets now for how long Trump can keep his fingers off the \u201cTweet\u201d button as one of his main Twitter targets, the Federal Reserve, is expected this afternoon to cut interest rates for the first time in a decade. For months, Trump has been pushing the Fed to cut rates on Twitter - and in the process defied the presidential norm of keeping the central bank sectioned off from the political sphere. It\u2019s a slightly unusual move for the Fed as interest rates are usually lowered when the economy is slow, which it is not. Today, we\u2019ll have the live updates and analysis on the Fed announcement this afternoon, as well as previews of tonight\u2019s debates.",

      "bodyText": "Computer hackers and propaganda specialists working in the British army are to be placed in a single division, as part of a reorganisation designed to reflect a belief that the boundary between peace and war has become increasingly blurred. The cyber and intelligence experts will be consolidated into a reborn 6th Division \u2013 one of three in the army with a strength of 14,500 \u2013 which will also contain ground troops who can be used in secret, special forces-type operations. Lt Gen Ivan Jones, the commander of the British field army, said the plan reflected the fact that \u201cthe character of warfare continues to change\u201d and \u201cthe boundaries between conventional and unconventional warfare\u201d had become blurred. One of the early tasks for the rebranded unit is to better tackle disinformation and fake news emerging from Russia and elsewhere. For example, at the end of a recent exercise in Croatia, stories circulated that British soldiers had tried to abduct a native child only to be fought off by locals. \u201cWhat happened was that a handful of incidents that happened after the exercise, regrettable stories of soldiers accused of vandalism or urinating in public, were exaggerated online locally and began to appear in local media. We need people on the ground from the new 6th Div who can quickly counter that,\u201d a military source said. However, deliberate disinformation has been used in Mosul and northern Iraq \u201cto great effect\u201d to undermine Islamic State, army sources indicated, although they declined to provide further details for security reasons. British combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan finished 10 and five years ago, and while the military are now engaged in some covert missions such as in Yemen, conventional war fighting is currently rare. Troops are more likely to be engaged in peacekeeping and security operations, such as leading a Nato battlegroup on the Russian border in Estonia, or engaged in exercises in parts of the world where a visible UK presence is deemed politically desirable. But there is an increasing view that conflict has moved to the electronic and information arenas \u2013 particularly with Russia, but also with countries such as China and Iran \u2013 in which a key question is whether the UK can play a role to ensure that countries in eastern Europe remained allied with the west. Earlier this year, Gen Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, the chief of general staff, argued that peace and war were \u201ctwo increasingly redundant states\u201d because authoritarian regimes were \u201cexploiting the hybrid space that exists in between\u201d. The reorganisation has been undertaken within the existing defence budget, although the army remains several thousand short of its target full-time strength of 82,000, with overall troop numbers at their lowest levels since before the two world wars. In the race to be prime minister, the eventual winner Boris Johnson promised only to maintain defence spending at the existing level of just over 2% of GDP, unlike defeated rival Jeremy Hunt, who said he would lift it by \u00a315bn to 2.5%. Generals hope that it will be possible to further retrain soldiers keen to work or improve their skills as hackers or information specialists to enhance the capabilities of the 6th Division, based in Upavon in Wiltshire. The change will also see the army\u2019s 1st Division reorganised to focus more clearly on logistics, engineers and medics.

A report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has found that BlackRock has eroded the value of its $6.5tn funds by betting on oil companies that were falling in value and by missing out on growth in clean energy investments. The report found that BlackRock\u2019s multibillion-dollar investments in the world\u2019s largest oil companies \u2013 including ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP \u2013 were responsible for the bulk of its losses. The fund manager was also stung by the collapse of big US fossil fuel companies, including General Electric, and the coal mining company Peabody. BlackRock faces growing pressure to divest from fossil fuels by investors and environmental groups, which have accused the asset manager of dragging its feet on the climate crisis. Tim Buckley, a director at IEEFA and co-author of the report, said BlackRock\u2019s enormous financial heft meant it should take responsibility for leading on the climate emergency. Its combined funds are larger than the economy of Japan, the third largest economy in the world, making it the single largest investor in the global coal industry and one of the top three investors in most big oil companies. \u201cBlackRock wields an enormous amount of influence and shoulders a huge responsibility to the wider community. It has the power to lead globally to address climate risk, yet, to date, it remains a laggard,\u201d Buckley said. The report follows a stark warning from the Bank of England over the \u201csignificant risks to the economy and to the financial system\u201d posed by fossil fuel investments. The Bank has estimated that investments worth $20tn could be left \u201cstranded\u201d as governments set more ambitious climate targets. BlackRock has denied responsibility for its fossil fuel investments because the majority of its funds track investment indices which are controlled by third parties, meaning it does not choose individual companies to back. The IEEFA has used the report to call on BlackRock to propose its own low emissions index benchmark for the passive funds to avoid risking its clients\u2019 investments. It has also called on the fund to appoint a new independent chairman and refresh its 18-strong board, where six members are former executives from companies with close ties to the fossil fuel industry.

But Root and Trevor Bayliss, the England captain and head coach respectively, are understood to have been surprised during a meeting on Wednesday with Ranjan Madugalle, the International Cricket Council match referee, when they saw it on the running order agreed by the two countries without being asked formally.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/31/name-15-intimidating-venues-edgbaston-tim-paine\">I could name 15 more intimidating venues than Edgbaston, says Tim Paine</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Eoin Morgan, England\u2019s one-day captain, agreed to the same request from Paine before the one-day international series last summer and there was perhaps an assumption, either by Cricket Australia or by the ICC, that the same would apply once more. Root, while not looking to stoke up ill-feeling between the teams, is said to be less than convinced of the necessity for what is essentially a PR move, not least since it does not take place before any other Test series. It now remains to be seen whether the England captain reluctantly complies and the handshakes take place before play.</p> \n<p>Asked how he expected Australia\u2019s players to behave this series, Root replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll see how that unfolds in the course of the series. To be honest, their behaviour doesn\u2019t really concern me. The thing that concerns me is that we go about things in our own way.

      "bodyText": "Joe Root has been left frustrated at discovering pre-match player handshakes are listed among the events before the Ashes opener on Thursday despite not being consulted. Tim Paine, the Australia captain, has looked to bring in the football\u2011inspired goodwill ritual at the start of every Test series his side play as a way of rebuilding their image after the ball\u2011tampering scandal in South Africa last year. But Root and Trevor Bayliss, the England captain and head coach respectively, are understood to have been surprised during a meeting on Wednesday with Ranjan Madugalle, the International Cricket Council match referee, when they saw it on the running order agreed by the two countries without being asked formally. Eoin Morgan, England\u2019s one-day captain, agreed to the same request from Paine before the one-day international series last summer and there was perhaps an assumption, either by Cricket Australia or by the ICC, that the same would apply once more. Root, while not looking to stoke up ill-feeling between the teams, is said to be less than convinced of the necessity for what is essentially a PR move, not least since it does not take place before any other Test series. It now remains to be seen whether the England captain reluctantly complies and the handshakes take place before play. Asked how he expected Australia\u2019s players to behave this series, Root replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll see how that unfolds in the course of the series. To be honest, their behaviour doesn\u2019t really concern me. The thing that concerns me is that we go about things in our own way. It\u2019s really important we look after that and don\u2019t get too wrapped up in how they play their cricket.\u201d On a personal level Root is being driven by the memories of ending England\u2019s 4-0 defeat in Australia 18 months ago stricken on a sickbed as he looks to fulfil a boyhood dream of becoming an Ashes-winning captain. At a ground that Paine claimed would not make his top 15 most intimidating in the world Root named an XI denying Jofra Archer his debut with Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes preferred. As well as explaining his own move to No 3 as a way of spreading experience in the batting order, Root recalled the feeling of losing his only previous Ashes series as captain. It was a tough ending for him when struck down by gastroenteritis in Sydney and forced to retire ill on 58. Root, who was so poorly he missed Australia\u2019s players celebrating, said: \u201cI felt gutted and raw at the end of it. I never want to be there and lose a big series like the Ashes but it does make you more steely and desperate to go out and turn things round this time.\u201d Asked what it would mean to lead an England side to an Ashes win, having previously tasted it as a player in 2015, he replied: \u201cI dreamed about it from being a little boy and obviously it became more real by being put in a position to have that opportunity.\u201d A big difference from 18 months ago is the presence of Ben Stokes, who missed that series during the fallout from the Bristol incident but has since returned to the Test side and, following his heroics in the World Cup final, been restored as vice-captain. Root revealed he had been making the request for Stokes as his No 2 for some time and said: \u201cHe has the full respect of everyone because of how he approaches training and every big moment. You know he is going to throw himself into it and he\u2019s never going to ask something from you that he wouldn\u2019t expect from himself. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have him as vice\u2011captain again \u2013 it\u2019s an opportunity for him to come to the fore. As you\u2019ve seen throughout the World Cup, when he\u2019s been given added responsibility, he\u2019s stepped up to it and I expect the same in this series.\u201d Archer\u2019s omission will disappoint those wowed by his World Cup performances but England feared he was not yet ready for the physical exertions of Test cricket following the side issue that required painkilling injections during that victorious campaign. With Sussex playing only Twenty20 cricket before the Lord\u2019s Test on 14 August, Archer may have to build up his bowling workloads in the nets unless England can arrange a loan deal for the Worcestershire match against Australia that sits in between. Such a move is not unprecedented \u2013 Andrew Strauss played for Somerset on loan from Middlesex before the 2011 series with India \u2013 but England may wish to deny Australia\u2019s batsmen the chance to face Archer early.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 1 August. Top stories The besieged gaming empire Crown Resorts has yet to satisfy the Victorian gambling regulator it has fixed nine serious problems at its flagship Melbourne casino, including money laundering risks and the presence of alleged criminals. The recommendations from the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation were to be in place by 1 July, but documents provided by its chairman, Ross Kennedy, show the gaming group has not done enough to discharge them. Yesterday Crown hit back at this week\u2019s media revelations in newspaper ads signed by its board of directors, slamming Nine\u2019s coverage as a \u201ca deceitful campaign\u201d that \u201cunfairly attempted to damage Crown\u2019s reputation\u201d. The powerful US backers of a conservative conference being held in Sydney next week say the event won\u2019t be a one-off, and they are committed to making it a \u201cmulti-year, forever-type project\u201d aimed at galvanising the right wing of Australian politics. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking at having this event running many, many years down the track,\u201d CPAC organiser Andrew Cooper told Guardian Australia, \u201cand we have a vision for this that has thousands and thousands of attendees, not hundreds and hundreds.\u201d The conference will feature the Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, Tony Abbott and Mark Latham. On Tuesday night in the Senate, the event was attacked by Labor senator Kristina Keneally as a \u201ctalkfest of hate\u201d, with particular focus on the attendance of Raheem Kassam, a former chief adviser to Farage and editor-in-chief of Breitbart. NBN Co should focus less on recouping the $50bn taxpayer investment in the project and more on value for customers, the ACCC head, Rod Sims, has said. \u201cWe must ignore those who worry about the value of assets that are sunk, and focus on how the NBN can best contribute to Australia,\u201d Sims plans to say in a speech to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and Australian Energy Regulator conference in Brisbane. Sims told Guardian Australia that with the NBN almost completed, it should offer more affordable basic plans rather than trying to get people to pay for higher speeds they may not need. World Forty people have appeared in a Hong Kong courtroom facing up to 10 years in jail on rioting charges over their role in mass protests that have convulsed the city since June. Boris Johnson has sent his most senior EU adviser and Brexit negotiator to Brussels, to deliver in person his message that the UK will leave without a deal unless the bloc abolishes the Irish backstop. Germany\u2019s interior minister is calling for restraint after far-right politicians sought to exploit for political gain the death of an eight-year-old boy who was pushed in front of a train at Frankfurt station this week. The financier Jeffrey Epstein looked physically healthy when he appeared in court in New York on Wednesday in his sex trafficking case, about a week after reportedly being found unconscious in his jail cell with neck injuries. A prominent British art dealer who defrauded his clients out of millions by using a scheme that involved masterpieces by artists including Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall has been sentenced to up to 12 years in prison. Opinion and analysis In ecological terms the royal family is a herd of elephants trashing the forest but Prince Harry\u2019s plans to have only two children is good news, writes the Guardian\u2019s former environment editor John Vidald. \u201cThe planet is not responding well to your jet-setting lifestyle, and two more little Sussexes adopting Dad and Mum\u2019s ways won\u2019t help,\u201d Vidal writes. \u201cOver a lifetime, the average British-born babe will emit up to 150 times more CO2 than one born in Ethiopia. You are only 34, and you have probably already emitted more CO2 and other greenhouse gases than most of the 18 million people living in Malawi will do in their lifetimes.\u201d Sorry, men, but we are still the slackest of the sexes, writes Greg Jericho. However you want to cut it, it is clear that women are the workers of the nation \u2013 and most of it is unpaid. \u201cHousework and taking care of your children does not bring a wage, nor appear in the GDP figures, yet of course were you to pay someone to do those tasks it most definitely would. The latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, released on Tuesday, shows that this work is overwhelmingly done by women and at levels that really should shame men in this country.\u201d Sport England regained some pride in the final women\u2019s Ashes T20 in Bristol overnight, beating Australia by 17 runs, despite another brilliant 60 not out from Ellyse Perry. But that did little to change the fact that Australia have comprehensively outplayed them throughout the series. Tim Paine has come in from the cold to the lead the charge in the men\u2019s Ashes, which begin at Edgbaston on Thursday. Paine is determined to make his chance count and cap a remarkable rise when he seeks to become the first Australian since 2001 to captain a side to Ashes victory on English soil. Thinking time: Meal planning \u2013 middle-class hobby or good sense? Kate Turner is aware that the chalkboard meal planner in her kitchen can bewilder visitors. \u201cFriends come round and go, \u2018Wow, my God!,\u2019\u201d says the author of My Zero-Waste Kitchen.

It\u2019s a money-saver for anybody.\u201d But where do you start? Here are 10 detailed tips from experts. Media roundup From Orange to Bendigo and Kalgoorlie, a new gold rush is in full swing, the Australian Financial Review reports. Advances in exploration techniques, new approaches to mining and the highest Australian-dominated gold price in history are contributing to the rush, described as a \u201cgamechanger\u201d. The Age reports that fewer families are sending their children to religious schools, prompting one major Melbourne Catholic boys school to consider going co-ed to ward off decline.

But the team was able to hold onto its two most prized prospects, outfielder Kyle Tucker and right-handed pitcher Forrest Whitley.</p> <p>Greinke, 35, is in the midst of another stellar season. Before his outing against the Yankees, the right-hander was carrying a 10-4 record and 2.87 ERA. His .943 WHIP is tops in the National League. He has been an All-Star in each of the last three of his four seasons in Arizona. He is 197-122 with a 3.36 ERA in his 16-year career entering Wednesday.</p> <p>Sanchez, 27, was an All-Star in 2016 and led the AL in winning percentage and ERA. He has struggled mightily this season, however, winning just three games while losing a league-worst 14 and sporting a 6.07 ERA in 23 starts. He has a 32-33 career record with a 3.96 ERA.</p> <p>Biagini, 29, is 3-1 with a 3.86 ERA in 49 games out of the bullpen this season, picking up a save along the way.</p> <p>In four seasons, he has a 4.76 ERA in 203 games. He has 22 career starts but 18 of those were in 2017 and none of them came this season.</p> <p>The Astros now have a rotation of Justin Verlander, Gerrit Cole, Wade Miley, Greinke, and Sanchez. Between Verlander, Cole and Greinke, they have three pitchers in the top 10 in the majors in ERA, three in the top five in WHIP, two in the top three in hits per nine innings, two of the top 10 in walks per nine innings, and three of the top five in innings pitched.</p> <h2>San Francisco drop big contract while adding relief</h2> <p>The Giants have traded former closer Mark Melancon to the Atlanta Braves for right-handed reliever Daniel Winkler and a minor league pitcher.</p> <p>Melancon signed a $62 million, four-year contract with San Francisco in December 2016 but didn\u2019t emerge as the dominant closer he had been in part because of injuries.</p> <p>He had just 15 saves in his two-plus seasons with the Giants. </p> <p>In addition, San Francisco sent right-handed reliever Sam Dyson to the Twins and kept 2014 World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner. </p> <p>The 34-year-old right-hander is 4-2 with a 3.50 ERA in 43 appearances and 46 1/3 innings this season. </p> <p>When the Giants acquired him, Melancon had saved at least 30 games in three straight seasons, recording a majors-best 51 in 2015. He went 47 for 51 in save opportunities in 75 relief appearances last season with Pittsburgh and Washington, </p> <p>Winkler is 3-1 with a 4.98 ERA in 27 appearances this season. The Giants also received Class A pitcher Tristan Beck.</p> <h2>Cubs boost offense with Castellanos swap</h2> <p>The Chicago Cubs acquired outfielder Nicholas Castellanos from the Detroit Tigers for two minor league pitchers. </p> <p>The 27-year-old Castellanos hit .273 with 11 home runs and 37 RBIs for Detroit this season. He\u2019s played third base and in the outfield during his career and has been considered a liability defensively, but Castellanos gives Chicago a productive bat against left-handed pitching. </p> <p>Detroit received right-handers Paul Richan and Alex Lange. </p> <p>Castellanos is tied for the major league lead with 37 doubles. He has a .347 average and a 1.026 OPS this year in 72 at-bats against lefties. </p> <h2>Dodgers add infield depth</h2> <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers added infielder Jedd Gyorko, acquiring him from the St Louis Cardinals for left-hander Tony Cingrani and minor league righty Jeffry Abreu.</p> <p>The Dodgers also receive international cap space and cash considerations.</p> <p>The 30-year-old Gyorko has been on the injured list since 8 June with back and right wrist issues. He\u2019s hitting .196 on the season.</p> <p>Cingrani is also out following left shoulder surgery and hasn\u2019t pitched this season.</p> <p>The Dodgers entered the day with a 70-39 record, easily the best mark in the National League.</p> <h2>Nationals upgrade taxed bullpen</h2> <p>The Washington Nationals tried to upgrade their bullpen, acquiring relievers Roenis Elias and Hunter Strickland from Seattle and Daniel Hudson in a trade with Toronto.</p> <p>The Mariners received a trio of minor league pitchers from the Nationals left-handers Taylor Guilbeau and Aaron Fletcher and right-hander Elvis Alvarado.

      "bodyText": "Zack Greinke held the New York Yankees to two runs on two hits over five innings on Wednesday, and that was the good news for the Bronx Bombers when it comes to the veteran pitcher. In the closing minutes of the 4 pm ET trade deadline, the Houston Astros reportedly acquired Greinke from the Arizona Diamondbacks, the second last-minute pitching pickup that shifts the Astros to the favorites to win the American League over the Yankees. The Athletic\u2019s Ken Rosenthal was the first to report the Greinke deal. What\u2019s more, the New York Post\u2019s Joel Sherman reported that the Yankees were in pursuit of Toronto pitcher Aaron Sanchez ... and the Astros got him, too. The Blue Jays also sent pitcher Joe Biagini to Houston with Sanchez, reportedly in exchange for outfielder Derek Fisher. According to multiple reports, the Diamondbacks got four prospects for Greinke: first baseman/outfielder Seth Beer (the Astros\u2019 No 3 prospect per MLB Pipeline), right-handed pitcher JB Bukauskas (No 4), righty Corbin Martin (No 5) and utility player Joshua Rojas (No 22). But the team was able to hold onto its two most prized prospects, outfielder Kyle Tucker and right-handed pitcher Forrest Whitley. Greinke, 35, is in the midst of another stellar season. Before his outing against the Yankees, the right-hander was carrying a 10-4 record and 2.87 ERA. His .943 WHIP is tops in the National League. He has been an All-Star in each of the last three of his four seasons in Arizona. He is 197-122 with a 3.36 ERA in his 16-year career entering Wednesday. Sanchez, 27, was an All-Star in 2016 and led the AL in winning percentage and ERA. He has struggled mightily this season, however, winning just three games while losing a league-worst 14 and sporting a 6.07 ERA in 23 starts. He has a 32-33 career record with a 3.96 ERA. Biagini, 29, is 3-1 with a 3.86 ERA in 49 games out of the bullpen this season, picking up a save along the way. In four seasons, he has a 4.76 ERA in 203 games. He has 22 career starts but 18 of those were in 2017 and none of them came this season. The Astros now have a rotation of Justin Verlander, Gerrit Cole, Wade Miley, Greinke, and Sanchez. Between Verlander, Cole and Greinke, they have three pitchers in the top 10 in the majors in ERA, three in the top five in WHIP, two in the top three in hits per nine innings, two of the top 10 in walks per nine innings, and three of the top five in innings pitched. San Francisco drop big contract while adding relief The Giants have traded former closer Mark Melancon to the Atlanta Braves for right-handed reliever Daniel Winkler and a minor league pitcher. Melancon signed a $62 million, four-year contract with San Francisco in December 2016 but didn\u2019t emerge as the dominant closer he had been in part because of injuries. He had just 15 saves in his two-plus seasons with the Giants. In addition, San Francisco sent right-handed reliever Sam Dyson to the Twins and kept 2014 World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner. The 34-year-old right-hander is 4-2 with a 3.50 ERA in 43 appearances and 46 1/3 innings this season. When the Giants acquired him, Melancon had saved at least 30 games in three straight seasons, recording a majors-best 51 in 2015. He went 47 for 51 in save opportunities in 75 relief appearances last season with Pittsburgh and Washington, Winkler is 3-1 with a 4.98 ERA in 27 appearances this season. The Giants also received Class A pitcher Tristan Beck. Cubs boost offense with Castellanos swap The Chicago Cubs acquired outfielder Nicholas Castellanos from the Detroit Tigers for two minor league pitchers. The 27-year-old Castellanos hit .273 with 11 home runs and 37 RBIs for Detroit this season. He\u2019s played third base and in the outfield during his career and has been considered a liability defensively, but Castellanos gives Chicago a productive bat against left-handed pitching. Detroit received right-handers Paul Richan and Alex Lange. Castellanos is tied for the major league lead with 37 doubles. He has a .347 average and a 1.026 OPS this year in 72 at-bats against lefties. Dodgers add infield depth The Los Angeles Dodgers added infielder Jedd Gyorko, acquiring him from the St Louis Cardinals for left-hander Tony Cingrani and minor league righty Jeffry Abreu. The Dodgers also receive international cap space and cash considerations. The 30-year-old Gyorko has been on the injured list since 8 June with back and right wrist issues. He\u2019s hitting .196 on the season. Cingrani is also out following left shoulder surgery and hasn\u2019t pitched this season. The Dodgers entered the day with a 70-39 record, easily the best mark in the National League. Nationals upgrade taxed bullpen The Washington Nationals tried to upgrade their bullpen, acquiring relievers Roenis Elias and Hunter Strickland from Seattle and Daniel Hudson in a trade with Toronto. The Mariners received a trio of minor league pitchers from the Nationals left-handers Taylor Guilbeau and Aaron Fletcher and right-hander Elvis Alvarado. Washington sent minor league right-hander Kyle Johnston to Toronto for Hudson, who can become a free agent at the end of the season. Elias has been Seattle\u2019s primary closer for the majority of the season after Strickland suffered a lat strain in the opening week and missed several months. Strickland has appeared in just four major league games this season. Elias has appeared in 44 games and was 4-2 with a 4.40 ERA and 14 saves for Seattle. The 32-year-old Hudson went 6-3 with a 3.00 ERA and two saves in 45 games for the Blue Jays. Brewers improve pitching with late swap Milwaukee has acquired left-hander Drew Pomeranz and righty Ray Black from the San Francisco Giants for infield prospect Mauricio Dubon. Also Wednesday, San Francisco obtained second baseman Scooter Gennett from the Reds for a player to be named. Cincinnati will send cash to the Giants to cover part of Gennett\u2019s $9,775,000 salary. Until the Giants recently began winning, there had been speculation for months that left-handed ace Madison Bumgarner the 2014 World Series MVP would be on the trading block, but he is staying put as San Francisco (54-53) tries to contend in manager Bruce Bochy\u2019s final season before retirement. The Brewers were looking to add pitching depth given a decision was expected Tuesday on whether left-hander Gio Gonzalez would need a stint on the injured list after he left his start last Friday against the Cubs with tightness in his pitching shoulder. Pomeranz can work as a starter or reliever. Milwaukee acquired right-hander Jordan Lyles from the Pirates on Monday to boost the rotation. Yanks add arm at deadline The Yankees got a pitcher at the deadline for one of their Class A affiliates. New York acquired left-hander Alfredo Garcia from the Colorado Rockies for right-handed reliever Joseph Harvey in a deal announced shortly after the 4 p.m. deadline to make deals. The Yankees have been seeking pitching upgrades for the big league club. Garcia won\u2019t be that, at least not this year. The 20-year-old is 2-9 with a 6.28 ERA in Class A. He\u2019s struck out 103 in 90 1/3 innings. Harvey pitched 10 innings out of New York\u2019s bullpen this year as a rookie, posting a 4.50 ERA. Phils bolster outfield The Philadelphia Phillies bolstered their outfield by acquiring veteran Corey Dickerson from the Pittsburgh Pirates for cash and a player to be named. Dickerson, who could become a free agent at the end of the season, hit .317 with four home runs and 25 RBIs for the Pirates. The 30-year-old missed most of the first half of the season with a strained throwing shoulder. The Pirates acquired Dickerson from Tampa Bay on the eve of the 2018 regular season. Dickerson responded by hitting .300 with 13 home runs and 55 RBIs. He also won his first career Gold Glove for his play in left field. Pittsburgh\u2019s fade from contention after the All-Star break and the rise of young outfielder Bryan Reynolds in Dickerson\u2019s absence made him expendable for a team now looking toward 2020 and beyond. A\u2019s fill out rotation with starter The playoff-contending Oakland Athletics have acquired starter Tanner Roark from the Cincinnati Reds, filling out a rotation that also could have left-hander Sean Manaea back soon. Oakland dealt outfield prospect Jameson Hannah to Cincinnati. The Reds are sending Oakland $2.1 million to offset much of the $3,225,806 remaining in Roark\u2019s $10 million salary. The A\u2019s began the day a half-game out of the second AL wild-card spot. Roark lasted a season-low 3 1/3 innings during Cincinnati\u2019s 11-4 loss to the Pirates on Tuesday. He is 6-7 in 21 starts with a 4.24 ERA and can become a free agent after the season. Manaea struck out eight in six innings of a rehab start at Triple-A this week. He\u2019s likely to get one more rehab start before being activated. He had shoulder surgery last September.",

In his last known public statement, made through al-Qaida\u2019s media outlet in March 2018, Hamza bin Laden had threatened Saudi Arabia and called on the people of the Arabian peninsula to revolt.

      "bodyText": "Congratulations to Mauricio Pochettino, who has been nominated for a top Fifa award. The 47-year-old is on the shortlist for the best men\u2019s coach alongside Pep Guardiola, J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Brazil\u2019s Tite. It is a great accolade, the coaching version of the Ballon d\u2019Or, but after what Pochettino has been saying this week he may yet have to be excused on a technicality. Following the pre-season victory against Real Madrid on Tuesday Pochettino used his press conference to remind everyone he is not in fact Tottenham\u2019s coach but their manager. Although at that moment he did not feel like it. \u201cToday I feel like I am the coach,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI am not in charge and I know nothing about the situation of my players. I am only coaching them and trying to get the best from them. Sell, buy players, sign contract, not sign contract \u2013 I think it is not in my hands, it\u2019s in the club\u2019s hands and [chairman] Daniel Levy.

Australia would indeed appear to be \u2018just too good\u2019, but am I being too simplistic in putting it down to superior fielding (followed by batting and bowling)? Time was, it was the fielding excellence of Australia\u2019s men\u2019s side which allowed us to edge so many wins (my memory is telling me that a baseball coach was responsible for that halcyon era, but I could be wrong!) \u2026 At any rate: as I commented during the second T20, it\u2019s marvellous to see the never-say-die spirit of England in this contest. It\u2019s not over yet, right?\u201d</p> <p>Not <em>yet. </em>Australia are a great fielding side but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s the biggest reason for their dominance.

The good news for England is that the torment is almost over. The bad news is that there isn\u2019t enough Aloe Vera in the world to heal the scars caused by Australia\u2019s pitiless excellence this summer. This has been a traumatic thrashing for England; the kind that, if you\u2019re not careful, bleeds into the next Ashes series, and the next, and the next, until one day you start dining out on the fact you once beat Ellyse Perry\u2019s outside edge.</p> <p>A win tonight would give Australia a 14-2 series victory, which would be a record since the points system was introduced in 2013. (England won 12-4 that year.) England have avoided defeat only once, in the one-off Test match, and they were second best in that game as well.</p> <p>Their <em>Ashes horribilis </em>has prompted the kind of soul-searching and domestic-structure-bemoaning this country does so readily. England can play better - there\u2019s your daily insight, folks! - but they are still the second best team in the world. For mine, this Ashes has been more about Australia\u2019s strengths than their weaknesses. </p> <p>On reflection it was naive to think England had much of a chance. They are playing against the greatest team in women\u2019s cricket history. But I doubt England will draw much succour from that.</p> <p><strong>The match </strong>begins at 6.30pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T17:01:26.520Z\">at 6.01pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you with our match report from Bristol. Thanks for your company; please join us tomorrow for the other Ashes. Goodnight! They are best team in the world by a mile, and for the most part they have completely outplayed England. But England will hope this was a glimpse of a brighter future, particularly in the performances of their two 20-year-old spinners, Sophie Ecclestone and the debutant Mady Villiers. They bowled beautifully to take combined figures of five for 42 from eight overs, which ensured an England victory despite a brilliant 60 not out from Ellyse Perry. 20th over: Australia 122-8 (Perry 60, Schutt 8) That\u2019s a really impressive victory from England. It doesn\u2019t change what has been a dreadful series, but they played with pride and purpose to deservedly beat an Australian side who were intent on going through the series unbeaten. Katherine Brunt roars with delight after securing England\u2019s victory. Wareham mistimes a pull straight to Sciver at mid-on, and Australia need 27 from 3 balls. 19th over: Australia 112-7 (Perry 58, Wareham 0) Ecclestone ends a masterful spell with figures of 4-1-22-3. What a beautiful, crafty spinner she is becoming. Australia - or rather Ellyse Perry - need 28 from 6 balls. Ecclestone finishes her spell with two wickets in two balls. Kimmince misses a swing across the line and is trapped in front. England are going to end a miserable series on a high. Jonassen is plumb LBW after missing a reverse sweep, and Australia need 28 from 7 balls. 18th over: Australia 103-5 (Perry 50, Jonassen 8) Perry completes the usual half-century from 45 balls, but the match is slipping away from Australia. They manage only six from Cross\u2019s third over, which means the target is now 37 from 12 balls. If Perry wins this game, they might as well rename cricket in her honour, never mind this Ashes series. 17th over: Australia 97-5 (Perry 46, Jonassen 6) For England, in this position, singles are the new dot balls. There are two to start Ecclestone\u2019s third over, followed by two actual dot balls. Perry inside-edges a rare hack past leg stump for a couple, but that\u2019s it for the over - just four runs from it. For a 20-year-old, that was such an accomplished over from Ecclestone. 16th over: Australia 93-5 (Perry 43, Jonassen 5) Perry launches Villiers over long-on for her second six, another majestic stroke, and Jonassen completes a good over for Australia by driving through mid-off for four. Thirteen from the over. Villiers ends a fine debut with figures of 4-0-20-2. 15th over: Australia 80-5 (Perry 35, Jonassen 0) Brunt clenches her fists at the end of another excellent over. She has had quite some match. Australia need 60 from 30 balls. Katherine Brunt strikes again! Haynes hoicks a length ball straight to deep midwicket, where Danni Wyatt takes an easy catch. That\u2019s Brunt\u2019s second wicket to go with a rapid 25 not out. 14th over: Australia 77-4 (Perry 34, Haynes 7) Brilliant batting from Perry, who cracks boundaries off the first two deliveries from Shrubsole - the first over mid-off, the second to wide long-on. A single off each of the last four deliveries makes it a good over for Australia. The quicker bowlers have been easier to hit tonight, in both innings, and it\u2019s no surprise that the England spinners, Ecclestone and Villiers, have combined figures of 5-1-16-3. 13th over: Australia 65-4 (Perry 24, Haynes 5) England will assume nothing while Ellyse Perry is at the crease. But, accomplished as she is at scoring off almost every delivery, a required rate of almost 11 an over looks extremely tricky. 12th over: Australia 57-4 (Perry 21, Haynes 2) The debutant Mady Villiers is winning this match for England. Another parsimonious over gives her wonderful figures of 3-0-7-2, and leaves Australia needing 83 from 48 balls. 11th over: Australia 54-4 (Perry 19, Haynes 1) Perry drives Ecclestone for a straight six, the first of the innings. Yet even that isn\u2019t enough for Australia to keep up with the required rate. Nine runs from the over; the required rate is now 9.55. 10th over: Australia 45-4 (Perry 11, Haynes 0) Australia need 95 from 60 balls. Two wickets in the over for Villiers! Gardner lunged forward at a delivery angled across her from round the wicket, and Jones completed a really smart stumping. Villiers, on her debut, has figures of two for four! Mady Villiers gets her first international wicket! Healy, dropped in Villiers\u2019 previous over, lofts a low full toss high to long off, where Ecclestone takes the catch. For the first time in the Ashes, England are in control of a match against Australia. 9th over: Australia 43-2 (Healy 28, Perry 9) England rotated the strike expertly for most of their innings, and Perry is starting to do the same for Australia. She and Healy take eight from Cross\u2019s over, all in ones and twos. 8th over: Australia 35-2 (Healy 26, Perry 3) The debutant Mady Villiers comes into the attack - and she drops Healy off her own bowling from the second ball! It was a fairly routine chance as Healy smacked the ball back at hear, but it burst through her hands. That can only be nerves because she\u2019s usually a very accomplished fielder. It was a fine over nonetheless, with just two runs from it. Australia need 105 from 72 balls. Whether they win or lose, this has been such an admirable performance from England. 7th over: Australia 33-2 (Healy 25, Perry 2) Nat Sciver\u2019s first over goes for six, all in ones and twos. The required rate is up to 8.38 per over. 6th over: Australia 27-2 (Healy 21, Perry 0) Replays confirm that was a superb decision from the umpire Alex Wharf. And it was an even better over from Eccelstone - not just a wicket maiden, but a Lanning wicket maiden. Breaking news: Meg Lanning is out! It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s been dismissed in an IT20 against England since 2016, and it was a lovely piece of bowling from Sophie Ecclestone - an arm ball that beat Lanning on the inside and hit the pad in front of middle stump. It was pad first, then bat a split second later, and the umpire Alex Wharf raised the finger. 5th over: Australia 27-1 (Healy 21, Lanning 2) An inside-edge saves Lanning from being plumb LBW first ball, and then a mistimed pull from Healy lands just short of Shrubsole running in from mid-off. This is England\u2019s chance, right here. Australia need 113 from 90 balls. The first wicket of the innings for England. Beth Mooney, who was starved of the strike in the first four overs, clunks Brunt straight to Kate Cross in the covers. She faced only six balls out of 25 in the innings, and that manifested itself in a slightly desperate stroke. 4th over: Australia 24-0 (Healy 20, Mooney 2) Healy launches Shrubsole high over extra cover for four. She has already hit more boundaries than any of the England batters, although there have been a lot of dot balls in between the boundaries. 3rd over: Australia 18-0 (Healy 15, Mooney 1) Healy continues to punish England square of the wicket, cutting the new bowler Katherine Brunt for her third boundary. She has monopolised the strike (14 balls from 18) and the scoring (15 from 18). \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Sarah Bacon. \u201cSo what are your thoughts? Australia would indeed appear to be \u2018just too good\u2019, but am I being too simplistic in putting it down to superior fielding (followed by batting and bowling)? Time was, it was the fielding excellence of Australia\u2019s men\u2019s side which allowed us to edge so many wins (my memory is telling me that a baseball coach was responsible for that halcyon era, but I could be wrong!) \u2026 At any rate: as I commented during the second T20, it\u2019s marvellous to see the never-say-die spirit of England in this contest. It\u2019s not over yet, right?\u201d Not yet. Australia are a great fielding side but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s the biggest reason for their dominance. I should qualify this observation by saying that I know the square root of very little. 2nd over: Australia 12-0 (Healy 10, Mooney 0) Anya Shrubsole shares the new ball. Her first ball is short, wide and slapped up and over the off side for four by Healy. Shrubsole gets her length right after that, with a bit of inswing as well, and completes the over with five dot balls. 1st over: Australia 8-0 (Healy 6, Mooney 0) Kate Cross starts the innings with a legside wide. Great stuff. Alyssa Healy pulls the third legal delivery behind square for four, an emphatic statement of intent. She is such a dangerous batter. If England can dismiss her cheaply - and Mooney, and Lanning, and Perry - they will have a chance. 20th over: England 139-5 (Winfield 26, Brunt 25) The last over of the innings, bowled by Jonassen, goes for 10 more. Winfield reverse sweeps breezily over the infield for four, bringing up a lovely fifty partnership from only 36 balls, and England steal an extra run from each of the last two deliveries with the aid of poor fielding from the bowler Jonassen. England scored 43 from the last four overs, which has given them a chance of a consolation victory. Australia need 140 to win. 19th over: England 129-5 (Winfield 21, Brunt 21) Katherine Brunt, the concept of defiance in human form, is dragging England towards a competitive total. She slog-sweeps Schutt over midwicket for six, the highlight of another productive over for England: 13 from it, including four byes when a yorker somehow beats Brunt, the leg stump and Healy. 18th over: England 116-5 (Winfield 18, Brunt 14) Winfield cuffs Gardner over midwicket for four, a superbly placed shot that bisects two fielders on the boundary, and then makes room to drive classily over mid-off for four more. England have scored 20 from the last two overs. 17th over: England 105-5 (Winfield 9, Brunt 13) Kimmince concedes her first boundary off the last ball of her spell, with Brunt pulling zestily over midwicket for four. That was a cracking shot. 16th over: England 96-5 (Winfield 7, Brunt 6) Winfield swings Wareham back over her head for four two, with Haynes making an outstanding sliding stop on the boundary. 15th over: England 93-5 (Winfield 4, Brunt 6) Thing is, England have played well tonight. They haven\u2019t felt sorry for themselves, which would have been the easy option. They\u2019ve been bright, aggressive and purposeful. And they\u2019re still, in all probability, going to lose the match. Australia are just so good. 14th over: England 87-5 (Winfield 2, Brunt 2) Two wickets in three balls! Ashleigh Gardner, bowling around the wicket, angles one across Jones, who tries to work to leg and gets a gossamer-thin edge that is smartly taken by the unsighted Healy. Alyssa Healy gives Heather Knight a send off after running her out. Knight came back for a tight second to midwicket and was beaten by a blistering throw from Perry, who changed her mind at the last minute and threw to the keeper\u2019s end when she realised Knight was struggling. Healy collected the throw and broke the stumps in one movement with Knight just short of her ground. 13th over: England 82-3 (Knight 22, Jones 19) Six from Kimmince\u2019s over. England are still struggling to hit boundaries - there have only five in the innings - but they will be pleased with how few dot balls there have been. 12th over: England 76-3 (Knight 19, Jones 17) A lovely shot from Amy Jones, who charges the first ball from the legspinner Georgia Wareham and drives it sweetly over mid-off for four. It\u2019s the start of a very good over for England - 12 from it - with Jones dragging another boundary behind square on the leg side. 11th over: England 64-3 (Knight 19, Jones 5) Jones survives a precautionary stumping referral after some nifty work from Healy. Three from Jonassen\u2019s over. I\u2019m slightly surprised Perry hasn\u2019t returned for an over, given her hold over Jones this summer. 10th over: England 61-3 (Knight 18, Jones 3) Knight is beaten for pace by consecutive deliveries from Vlaeminck, who has a lovely rhythm this evening. She then survives an LBW appeal - it was going down - and a run-out chance from the same delivery. A difficult over ends on a high when she swings the final delivery over square leg for six. Great shot. 9th over: England 54-3 (Knight 12, Jones 3) Knight, who has started purposefully, back cuts Kimmince for a couple. England are struggling to find the boundary, with just a four and a six from Wyatt, but they have manoeuvred the bowling pretty well. 8th over: England 48-3 (Knight 8, Jones 1) The new batter Amy Jones gets off the mark - not just in the match but the IT20 series. That was a very impressive opening over from Vlaeminck, with a top speed of 75mph. The pace of Tayla Vlaeminck is too much for Nat Sciver. She top-edges an attempted pull high in the air to third man, where Kimmince calmly takes the catch. 7th over: England 45-2 (Knight 6, Sciver 5) Delissa Kimmince replaces Megan Schutt. The tempo has changed since the departure of Wyatt, with England dealing exclusively in singles. There are five more from Kimmince\u2019s first over. 6th over: England 40-2 (Knight 4, Sciver 2) Knight scrambles to make her ground after taking a tight run to mid-on off the bowling of Jonassen. That\u2019s one of four singles from the over. England\u2019s intent has been much better today; they are just short of confidence. 5th over: England 36-2 (Knight 2, Sciver 0) It is happening again. After a slightly scruffy start, Australia are taking control of the game. Wyatt makes room to cut Schutt, misses and is bowled. That ends a perky innings of 20 from 19 balls, and leaves England in a bit of bother. 4th over: England 31-1 (Wyatt 17, Knight 1) Heather Knight has promoted herself to No3. Jess Jonassen strikes with her third ball! Beaumont runs down the track and chips tamely to mid-on, where Beth Mooney takes a comfortable catch. That was a pretty meek stroke from Beaumont, who was berating herself even before it had reached Mooney. 3rd over: England 28-0 (Wyatt 15, Beaumont 5) After a front-foot no-ball from Perry, Beaumont is caught at midwicket off the resulting free hit. Wyatt, again on the charge, slices Perry majestically over backward point for six. That\u2019s an awesome stroke. This has been a fine start from England - not so much the runs as the intent with which they have played. \u201cEngland are a very good team, and if they\u2019re being made to look so bad, the rest of the sides don\u2019t stand a chance against Australia,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cLook out, people, the Aussie women might just become the most dominant cricket team we\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d 2nd over: England 17-0 (Wyatt 7, Beaumont 4) Wyatt, on the charge, slaps Megan Schutt over cover for the first boundary. It\u2019s been a busy start from England, who get four bonus runs when a big inswinger from Schutt beats both Wyatt and the keeper Healy. 1st over: England 6-0 (Wyatt 1, Beaumont 3) Ellyse Perry\u2019s first over is a bit of a mixed bag. There\u2019s a leg-side wide to Wyatt, who is also beaten by a beauty outside off stump. Beaumont then drags a short ball towards mid-on, where the sprawling Vlaeminck does very well to save a couple of runs. England have, as we suspected, made a change to their batting order: Tammy Beaumont will open with Danni Wyatt. It\u2019s a beautiful evening in Bristol. The players are ready, the umpires are ready. Let us flay. Amy Jones is listed to open for England, but she may drop down the order after a miserable time in the white-ball matches. She has made five runs in five innings, with four ducks, although she made a superb 64 on Test debut before this IT20 series. Spin! Spin! Spin! The young bowling allrounder Mady Villiers makes her England debut, while Australia bring in the fast bowler Tayla Vlaeminck. England Jones (wk), Wyatt, Beaumont, Knight (c), Sciver, Winfield, Brunt, Shrubsole, de Villiers, Ecclestone, Cross. Australia Healy (wk), Mooney, Lanning (c), Perry, Gardner, Haynes, Jonassen, Wareham, Kimmince, Schutt, Vlaeminck. \u201cWe want to finish off on a high,\u201d says Meg Lanning. \u201cWe need three hours of hard work tonight and we\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d Pre-match reading Here\u2019s Geoff Lemon on the great Meg Lanning, who has scored 388 runs against England in IT20s since she was last dismissed. And even that was a run out. Good evening. The good news for England is that the torment is almost over. The bad news is that there isn\u2019t enough Aloe Vera in the world to heal the scars caused by Australia\u2019s pitiless excellence this summer. This has been a traumatic thrashing for England; the kind that, if you\u2019re not careful, bleeds into the next Ashes series, and the next, and the next, until one day you start dining out on the fact you once beat Ellyse Perry\u2019s outside edge. A win tonight would give Australia a 14-2 series victory, which would be a record since the points system was introduced in 2013. (England won 12-4 that year.) England have avoided defeat only once, in the one-off Test match, and they were second best in that game as well. Their Ashes horribilis has prompted the kind of soul-searching and domestic-structure-bemoaning this country does so readily. England can play better - there\u2019s your daily insight, folks! - but they are still the second best team in the world. For mine, this Ashes has been more about Australia\u2019s strengths than their weaknesses. On reflection it was naive to think England had much of a chance. They are playing against the greatest team in women\u2019s cricket history. But I doubt England will draw much succour from that. The match begins at 6.30pm.",

You can\u2019t go through a whole season one match at a time.\u201d Dale said in a forthright statement on Tuesday that he had indeed provided the EFL with proof of funds, including to cope as requested with a possible \u00a31.5m loss which he described as \u201cfictional\u201d. But Jevans said that the EFL had asked for evidence that former players \u2013 who were part of the squad which won promotion from League Two in May but then revealed they had not been paid since February \u2013 have now been paid all the money owing to them. Full-time staff must now also be paid in full, as they are classed as \u201cfootball creditors\u201d in any insolvency procedure, such as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) which Bury entered into last month. At the time of the CVA, in which Dale committed to paying \u201cnon-football creditors\u201d 25p for every pound owed, players were stated to have been owed \u00a3405,815, within a total of almost \u00a31m owed to football creditors. No separate category was noted for wages owed to full-time staff. Jevans said the EFL has also been asking for evidence that: \u201cThe club could operate for a season, which means running a stadium, paying players, staff, stewards; we asked for that in very simple terms. Currently we have not received what we have asked for.\u201d Dale told the Guardian in response that the CVA will be financed and cover the former players\u2019 wages, that he is still in discussions with the EFL over the \u201cmythical \u00a31.5m,\u201d and said that current players have all been paid. Jevans added that the EFL will reflect on its rules governing takeovers in the light of the crisis at Bury which has followed Dale\u2019s \u00a31 takeover in December, as part of the league\u2019s ongoing review of its governance.",

      "body": "<p>This is the summer that keeps on giving. It is debatable whether fans are ready for another gut-wrenching, umbrella-handle-chewing sequence of cricket matches, let alone the protagonists in the middle, who have rollercoasted as far as the final and semi-final of a World Cup, which came to its sensational climax little more than a fortnight ago. But the Ashes are here after a necessarily truncated buildup.</p> \n<p>There has not been enough time to squeeze in all the usual hype. The prospect of 5-0 has been only briefly circulated and no one is too bothered by that; it is such a well-worn path; there has been little talk of headbutting the line, elite honesty or the magic of the baggy green, though Cameron Bancroft did take the precaution of packing his Australian cap when setting off to play for Durham, a wise move as it turns out.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jul/31/fuss-over-joe-roots-move-to-no-3-is-just-another-part-of-ashes-mythology\">Fuss over Joe Root\u2019s move to No 3 is just another part of Ashes mythology | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There has barely been time to speak of sandpaper in advance of the Edgbaston Test when the three prodigals return to the fray for Australia. Bancroft is expected to be back at the earliest opportunity alongside Steve Smith and David Warner, which removes the charge that a nascent Test career was ruined for ever by the myopic sensitivities of the senior members of the Australia side in Cape Town. He has been batting adhesively in tricky English conditions for the past two or three months, so their selectors will surely seize this chance to clear some consciences and renew Bancroft\u2019s international career.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Ben Stokes is restored as England\u2019s vice-captain. There is no time or inclination to agonise whether that is appropriate. The Bristol incident is now ancient history.</p> \n<p>So the buildup to an Ashes series, so often reminiscent of a poor pantomime accompanied by a bit of cod psychology, has been none the worse for the shortage of time. Instead, both teams have hurriedly assembled in Birmingham with more serious matters on their minds \u2013 such as what constitutes their best team. Neither side can be sure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b355a9b7-dc66-48f4-ace6-eb1e47ddd0bd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Igc5oO04hc0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Australia have two decisions to make: who bats at No 6 and who joins Pat Cummins, James Pattinson and Nathan Lyon in their bowling attack. There are three surprising contenders for that No 6 spot: Marnus Labuschagne \u2013 the definitive pronunciation will become clear once Jim Maxwell wraps his tongue round those syllables \u2013 offers a bit of leg-spin; Mitchell Marsh, who enjoyed his comeback in the last Ashes series could give assistance with his medium-pace bowling; and there is Matthew Wade, once the team\u2019s wicketkeeper but now, following the modern trend, a prolific specialist batsman. The better the pitch looks for batting the more likely one of those who can bowl gets a place.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>More surprising to the casual onlooker is that Australia are highly likely to split up the quartet who were their wicket-takers in the last Ashes series two years ago. The expectation is that Mitchell Starc, supreme throughout most of the World Cup, will be on the sidelines, a handy bowler to find himself ferrying the drinks in a yellow bib. At best he is competing with Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle for the third pace slot.</p> \n<p>Australia are setting great store on Siddle\u2019s effectiveness in English conditions, which has been enhanced after playing for Essex in the Championship. In the meantime they can legitimately claim that they have a fast bowling unit that is the envy of every Test nation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d6c9f0e8-6307-4b0c-96a3-c76b801cbf53\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LKVH_MoRoVE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>England had some tricky choices to make in this department but they have decided not to delay them. Their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/31/jofra-archer-misses-out-as-broad-and-anderson-reunited-for-first-ashes-test\" title=\"\">four-man pace attack will comprise Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes and Stokes</a>. They have gone for experience rather than pace, presumably on the assumption there will be some assistance for the seam bowlers at what has become England\u2019s favourite ground, the Brummie Colosseum. Both sides have the resources to juggle with their attack according to conditions and fitness. And they will surely do so.</p> \n<p>The England batting line-up is no longer a puzzle either but it is a curious thing. The Joes will be at three and four but the surprise is that Root will be ahead of Denly. What has happened \u2013 apart from being bowled out for 85 \u2013 for the plan to change so abruptly after that bizarre Test <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/26/england-ireland-lords-test-day-three-live-cricket\" title=\"\">against Ireland?</a></p> \n<p>The hope is that Root actively favours this move and that it is not a case of him dutifully, though reluctantly, kowtowing to his senior advisers. Root is the captain and England\u2019s best player and it is important he feels comfortable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jul/31/david-gower-leaving-sky-ashes-cricket\">David Gower was always so welcoming to viewers but he now faces long goodbye | Emma John</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The old Australian adage, promoted by Trevor Bayliss, that the best players always bat at three, may be outdated. Steve Smith now bats at four; Allan Border seldom came out higher than that; Steve Waugh was always at five or six. In previous Ashes series the Root at three conundrum might have been debated for a month; there has been little time for it here.</p> \n<p>All is set for the off; palms are sweatier and heartbeats quicker as more melodrama awaits on the horizon. Thankfully there has not been much time for too many predictions either but here are a couple. If England can get to 80 for two on a regular basis, then they will win the series but, as they say down under, that is a big ask. A personal guess is a 3-2 victory, given the frailty of both batting sides, the potency of their bowlers and the wonderfully devious Duke ball. But to which side?</p> \n<p>England: Roy, Burns, Root, Denly, Buttler, Stokes, Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Woakes, Broad, Anderson.</p> \n<p>Australia (possible): Warner, Bancroft, Khawaja, Smith, Head, Wade, Paine, Cummins, Pattinson, Siddle, Lyon.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This is the summer that keeps on giving. It is debatable whether fans are ready for another gut-wrenching, umbrella-handle-chewing sequence of cricket matches, let alone the protagonists in the middle, who have rollercoasted as far as the final and semi-final of a World Cup, which came to its sensational climax little more than a fortnight ago. But the Ashes are here after a necessarily truncated buildup. There has not been enough time to squeeze in all the usual hype. The prospect of 5-0 has been only briefly circulated and no one is too bothered by that; it is such a well-worn path; there has been little talk of headbutting the line, elite honesty or the magic of the baggy green, though Cameron Bancroft did take the precaution of packing his Australian cap when setting off to play for Durham, a wise move as it turns out. There has barely been time to speak of sandpaper in advance of the Edgbaston Test when the three prodigals return to the fray for Australia. Bancroft is expected to be back at the earliest opportunity alongside Steve Smith and David Warner, which removes the charge that a nascent Test career was ruined for ever by the myopic sensitivities of the senior members of the Australia side in Cape Town. He has been batting adhesively in tricky English conditions for the past two or three months, so their selectors will surely seize this chance to clear some consciences and renew Bancroft\u2019s international career. Meanwhile Ben Stokes is restored as England\u2019s vice-captain. There is no time or inclination to agonise whether that is appropriate. The Bristol incident is now ancient history. So the buildup to an Ashes series, so often reminiscent of a poor pantomime accompanied by a bit of cod psychology, has been none the worse for the shortage of time. Instead, both teams have hurriedly assembled in Birmingham with more serious matters on their minds \u2013 such as what constitutes their best team. Neither side can be sure. Australia have two decisions to make: who bats at No 6 and who joins Pat Cummins, James Pattinson and Nathan Lyon in their bowling attack. There are three surprising contenders for that No 6 spot: Marnus Labuschagne \u2013 the definitive pronunciation will become clear once Jim Maxwell wraps his tongue round those syllables \u2013 offers a bit of leg-spin; Mitchell Marsh, who enjoyed his comeback in the last Ashes series could give assistance with his medium-pace bowling; and there is Matthew Wade, once the team\u2019s wicketkeeper but now, following the modern trend, a prolific specialist batsman. The better the pitch looks for batting the more likely one of those who can bowl gets a place. More surprising to the casual onlooker is that Australia are highly likely to split up the quartet who were their wicket-takers in the last Ashes series two years ago. The expectation is that Mitchell Starc, supreme throughout most of the World Cup, will be on the sidelines, a handy bowler to find himself ferrying the drinks in a yellow bib. At best he is competing with Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle for the third pace slot. Australia are setting great store on Siddle\u2019s effectiveness in English conditions, which has been enhanced after playing for Essex in the Championship. In the meantime they can legitimately claim that they have a fast bowling unit that is the envy of every Test nation. England had some tricky choices to make in this department but they have decided not to delay them. Their four-man pace attack will comprise Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes and Stokes. They have gone for experience rather than pace, presumably on the assumption there will be some assistance for the seam bowlers at what has become England\u2019s favourite ground, the Brummie Colosseum. Both sides have the resources to juggle with their attack according to conditions and fitness. And they will surely do so. The England batting line-up is no longer a puzzle either but it is a curious thing. The Joes will be at three and four but the surprise is that Root will be ahead of Denly. What has happened \u2013 apart from being bowled out for 85 \u2013 for the plan to change so abruptly after that bizarre Test against Ireland? The hope is that Root actively favours this move and that it is not a case of him dutifully, though reluctantly, kowtowing to his senior advisers. Root is the captain and England\u2019s best player and it is important he feels comfortable. The old Australian adage, promoted by Trevor Bayliss, that the best players always bat at three, may be outdated. Steve Smith now bats at four; Allan Border seldom came out higher than that; Steve Waugh was always at five or six. In previous Ashes series the Root at three conundrum might have been debated for a month; there has been little time for it here. All is set for the off; palms are sweatier and heartbeats quicker as more melodrama awaits on the horizon. Thankfully there has not been much time for too many predictions either but here are a couple. If England can get to 80 for two on a regular basis, then they will win the series but, as they say down under, that is a big ask. A personal guess is a 3-2 victory, given the frailty of both batting sides, the potency of their bowlers and the wonderfully devious Duke ball. But to which side? England: Roy, Burns, Root, Denly, Buttler, Stokes, Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Woakes, Broad, Anderson. Australia (possible): Warner, Bancroft, Khawaja, Smith, Head, Wade, Paine, Cummins, Pattinson, Siddle, Lyon.",

Striking a slightly prickly figure on the eve of the series \u2013 perhaps understandably so after 14 months of fielding questions about his team\u2019s conduct since the ball-tampering scandal last year \u2013 the Australia captain looked to play down England\u2019s stronghold. \u201cEngland haven\u2019t lost here in how long?\u201d asked Paine, rhetorically, in reference to an 11-match winning run for the home side across all formats. \u201cI don\u2019t even know, I haven\u2019t looked at it and it doesn\u2019t concern us. \u201cWe think our best cricket is good enough and the Edgbaston pitch and Edgbaston crowd and grandstand, or whatever it is, won\u2019t play a part in deciding this Test match.\u201d Asked if there was a more intimidating ground in world cricket right now, he tersely replied: \u201cThan this? I could name you 15.\u201d Australia have not won at Edgbaston since the 2001 Ashes Test and Paine has played only two Twenty20 games at the ground. Pakistan, not England, were the opponents back then, with the wicketkeeper yet to experience the boisterous Hollies Stand in Ashes cricket. But despite his assertion, Paine admitted he has spoken to Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft \u2013 the trio who served suspensions for their part in the Cape Town incident \u2013 given that the boos that the first two received during their World Cup semi-final defeat at Edgbaston three weeks ago are likely to increase. \u201cIt\u2019s got the potential to unsettle anyone,\u201d Paine said: \u201cThey\u2019re human beings, they\u2019ve got feelings, they\u2019re no different to anyone else. I thought the guys handled themselves superbly throughout the World Cup. We spoke about the fact we think it\u2019s going to go up a notch. When it does you\u2019ve got a plan in place to handle it and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.\u201d Clearly the behaviour of his side will be heavily scrutinised over the next seven weeks but Paine believes they have turned a corner in this respect, with Australia having not received any disciplinary points since that fiery series against South Africa. Paine revealed a quote \u2013 wrongly \u2013 attributed to Winston Churchill is being used to form their position on the subject. \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken a little bit about this in the last 12 months. Our guys understand what\u2019s expected of them. They are role models not just for Australian people but all around the world. There\u2019s been a quote hanging around the changing room this week from Winston Churchill and that\u2019s that \u2018behaviour doesn\u2019t lie\u2019. We can talk all we like about how we\u2019re going to behave. You guys will see how we behave and can judge for yourselves.\u201d Paine said the misattributed quote was shared by the team\u2019s assistant coach, Brad Haddin, whose aggressive wicket-celebrations during the 2015 World Cup final was in keeping with Australia\u2019s previously hard\u2011edged approach. Aside from such talk, Paine was also asked about his own worth to the side, given it is nearly 13 years since his solitary first-class century for Tasmania. Alex Carey, while similarly lacking a back catalogue of runs at first-class level, impressed during the World Cup but missed out on an Ashes berth. Paine replied: \u201cI\u2019m 34 years old. I don\u2019t really care about my place in the side any more. I\u2019m here to do a job. I\u2019ve been put in this team to captain and keep wicket to the best of my ability. That\u2019s all I can do. \u201cAt 34 years of age if you\u2019re looking further ahead than the next Test match, you\u2019re kidding yourself. I realise how lucky I am, the position I\u2019ve come from and the position I\u2019m now in. I\u2019m enjoying the job I\u2019m doing, loving being in England, being part of an Ashes series, and I\u2019m just looking to enjoy it as much as I can.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One of the biggest holes in any economic discussion is the lack of accounting for unpaid work. Housework and taking care of your children does not bring a wage, nor appear in the GDP figures, yet of course were you to pay someone to do those tasks it most definitely would. The latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, released on Tuesday, shows that this work is overwhelmingly done by women and at levels that really should shame men in this country. Five years ago when looking at that year\u2019s release of the Hilda survey and the level of housework done by men and women I suggested that \u201cwhen you combine hours worked in employment, housework and childcare, men come off looking like a bunch of lazy, couch-lying, TV-watching sloths\u201d. It annoyed a few at the time, but the news alas, is that things have not improved much at all. Sorry men, but we are still the slackest of the sexes. The Hilda survey helpfully divides household up into a few groups \u2013 those where the main breadwinner is the man, is the woman, and where they both earn the same, and then whether or not they have dependent children. If we first look at those couples without children we see that in all cases women spend more hours on housework regardless of who is the main breadwinner: And before everyone gets up in arms about how yes they might do less housework but they spend more time outside fixing things up etc, the Hilda survey defines \u201chouse work\u201d as: Household errands, such as shopping, banking, paying bills and keeping financial records (but not driving children to school and other activities); Housework, such as preparing meals, washing dishes, cleaning house, washing clothes, ironing and sewing; and Outdoor tasks, including home maintenance (repairs, improvements, painting, etc.), car maintenance or repairs, and gardening. So it covers everything (driving kids to school counts as childcare, which we will get to later). Now to be fair, when we add in hours of paid work (which includes commutes) the picture looks better for men. In the case where men are the main breadwinner of a couple with no children they end up doing more paid work plus housework on average than women, but in no other situation do they do so: But where things really start to get distorted is when we include children into the mix. And just in case you think we\u2019re talking about breastfeeding, the Hilda survey defines \u201cchild care\u201d as \u201cplaying with your children, helping them with personal care, teaching, coaching or actively supervising them, or getting them to child care, school or other activities\u201d. In all cases women on average do more than seven hours extra a week childcare than men: Now yes you can understand in a household where the male is the main breadwinner that the father spends just under 11 hours a week on childcare compared to nearly 26 hours by the mother. But in cases where the woman is the main breadwinner they still on average spend 19.3 hours on child care compared to 11.2 by the man. That is pretty stunning. When we add housework into the mix we see clearly that it is not as if men are balancing out the load by doing the chores while the mother takes care of the children. Among couples who earn the same amount, women do on average 1.5 times the amount of housework and childcare than do men \u2013 14 extra hours a week. Women who are the main breadwinner have it easier \u2013 they only do 13 more hours a week than men! But when we add in paid work does it all balance out? Yes for households where the male is the main breadwinner, but it\u2019s not even close in the other two situations: In households where both partners earn the same, women on average do more than four and half hours a week total work more than their male partners (or around 6% more); while in households where women earn the most, they do nearly 13 hours more work \u2013 19% more. Little wonder that in all households women rated their satisfaction with the amount of free time they had lower than men: The good news is things have improved. Slightly. In 2002-04 women did around 1.7 times the amount of housework and childcare that men did in households where they both earned the same amount compared with the current 1.5 times: But the survey found that women on average are working more paid hours than they did in 2002-04, which means when we combine paid and unpaid work each week, there is little change \u2013 women still do around the same amount of hours each week more than men as they did in 2002-04: So sure, we men can pat ourselves on our backs, relatively speaking we\u2019re doing more household work and child caring than we did once. But cripes. However you want to cut it, it is clear that women are the workers of the nation. And most of it is unpaid. Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "An investigation of funeral providers has found a widespread lack of transparency, with high prices, varying costs and some sellers taking days to provide customers with quotes. A national mystery shop conducted by consumer group Choice found that 14 out of 36 providers did not give customers an estimated cost within 48 hours. And when they did, many gave lump sums, not itemised bills, ranging into the thousands. Saimi Jeong, an investigative journalist with Choice, said the same service \u2013 allowing people to view the body of their loved one \u2013 cost $110 at one provider and $1,600 at another, with no explanation for the difference. Jeong said she frequently encountered \u201cunexplained price differences\u201d and confusing charges. \u201cOne funeral home quoted $5,600 for a direct cremation in our mystery shop,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we looked at the costs, over half of this was made up by an opaque \u2018professional service fee\u2019.\u201d Funeral providers are regulated on a state-by-state basis, with the strictest regulations in Victoria, with New South Wales soon to follow, Jeong said. The NSW Department of Fair Trading is currently considering new rules that would make it easier for consumers to understand funeral charges. These would include a 48-hour timeframe to provide a price. In Victoria, providers are currently required to provide a \u201cclear and legible price list\u201d, and must offer the option of a basic funeral service, among other requirements. But in the Choice mystery shop \u2013 which ranged across the entire country \u2013 Jeong found many providers did not explain their charges. She said consumers, in such vulnerable situations, could be easily confused. For one option with just cremation and no service, she said $3,000 still went towards \u201cprofessional services\u201d. \u201cA direct cremation with no funeral service cost $5,600. When almost $3,000 of that is going towards a professional service fee, you do wonder where that money is actually going if they don\u2019t break that down further. Especially when there is no funeral. \u201cAll they are organising is transport, storage and the actual cremation. Apart from that you wouldn\u2019t think that would be something that costs $3,000.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Choice has written to NSW Fair Trading to recommend that providers should also be required to provide prices for specific items. Of the 36 funeral homes, 20 were owned by Invocare (the largest provider in the Asia-Pacific), 12 were independent, and four were owned by Propel, another funeral company. \u201cOverall, we had 14 that didn\u2019t provide any written quotes despite being asked for them in 48 hours,\u201d Jeong said. \u201cWe had to chase some of them, and in the end that number went down to nine.

But in his first remarks on the Crown crisis, Kennedy defended the agency\u2019s performance.

Victorian law requires the VCGLR to complete a full review of Crown\u2019s Melbourne license every five years. While the most recent review, finished in June last year, was the VCGLR\u2019s deepest dive into Crown\u2019s operations in the casino\u2019s 25-year history, it failed to appease critics such as Robinson who regard the regulator as ineffective. It also left unfinished an investigation into the arrest and conviction for illegal gambling promotion of 19 Crown staff in China \u2013 an inquiry that has now been running for two years and remains on foot. Crown was asked to complete two of the 20 recommendations made in the review \u2013 to \u201cfully engage\u201d Crown\u2019s independent directors in oversight of the Melbourne casino and to review the qualifications of committee chairs \u2013 by 1 January. The VCGLR is satisfied Crown has met these recommendations. Another eight, which include requirements to use data analytics to identify problem gamblers, are either due later in the year or have no due date. This leaves the 10 recommendations where Crown has yet to satisfy the VCGLR it has done enough. Crown was given a 1 July deadline to reassess its risk systems \u201cand upgrade them where required\u201d, \u201cundertake a robust review of internal controls\u201d to make sure its compliance department knew about projects that might need regulatory approval and \u201cundertake a comprehensive review of its policy for the making and revocation of voluntary exclusion orders\u201d, which allow people to bar themselves from the casino. By the same date, it was also to develop a policy allowing \u201cfamily members and friends\u201d to bar problem gamblers, put up new responsible gambling signs, develop a new responsible gambling policy and expand facial recognition technology to cover every entrance to the casino. The same deadline also applies to two important recommendations related to law enforcement: that Crown \u201cundertake a robust review\u201d, with input from financial intelligence agency Austrac, \u201cto ensure that anti-money laundering risks are appropriately addressed\u201d and that it \u201cimplement a policy to make an exclusion order\u2026 where a person has engaged in significant unacceptable conduct in the casino or is the subject of serious criminal charges\u201d.

Brad Haddin was about to pass the Australian wicketkeeping baton to Peter Nevill.</p> \n<p>During one of Australia\u2019s tour games before that Ashes series, the question was asked where Paine had got to. There was always an interest in him after he made his Test debut at Lord\u2019s in 2010 against Pakistan (alongside Steve Smith), a year after making his one and only century in the canary yellow against England opening the batting in an ODI.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/31/name-15-intimidating-venues-edgbaston-tim-paine\">I could name 15 more intimidating venues than Edgbaston, says Tim Paine</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He was nowhere, it was assumed on the basis of all this.

      "bodyText": "Four years ago, Tim Paine was behind the stumps for Banbury Cricket Club. He wasn\u2019t the overseas player in the county championship, but rather, the Home Counties Premier League \u2013 and living with the club chairman in North Oxfordshire. He was 30, had averaged 18 in his previous Sheffield Shield season and his most important finger had been operated on seven times. Brad Haddin was about to pass the Australian wicketkeeping baton to Peter Nevill. During one of Australia\u2019s tour games before that Ashes series, the question was asked where Paine had got to. There was always an interest in him after he made his Test debut at Lord\u2019s in 2010 against Pakistan (alongside Steve Smith), a year after making his one and only century in the canary yellow against England opening the batting in an ODI. He was nowhere, it was assumed on the basis of all this. But that was wrong. It was in this humble setting where Paine learned to love cricket again. \u201cIt really rekindled the fire,\u201d he said last year when looking back at the experience. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.\u201d Now? He\u2019s the man wearing the armband in one of the least likely of Ashes captaincies. The Tasmanian would be as mindful as anybody that this is a one-time chance to do something no Australian skipper has since 2001. Little wonder, then, he is determined to make it count. Whilst not formally a selector, Paine may as well be with the faith stored in him by coach Justin Langer. Together, they have taken a pragmatic approach to picking a team that sits outside the conventions of recent years. There is no better evidence of this than in how the fast bowling jigsaw is being put together this time around.

      "bodyText": "A pilot, a nurse and several teenage students were among 40 people who appeared in a Hong Kong courtroom on Wednesday facing up to 10 years in jail on rioting charges over their role in mass protests that have convulsed the city since June. Anger at the potential heavy sentences brought hundreds of demonstrators to the courtroom doors in support of the group inside, chanting \u201crevolution of our time\u201d and \u201cliberate Hong Kong\u201d. Rights groups warned that the riot charge and heavy-handed policing showed a \u201cflagrant disregard\u201d of city residents\u2019 rights and appeared aimed mostly at stifling dissent, as authorities grapple with the worst political crisis since the handover from British rule in 1997. The threat of rioting charges has been a source of anger since the protest movement began in early June, but this is the first time they have been deployed against demonstrators. \u201cBy using such vague charges against pro-democracy protesters, the Hong Kong authorities seem intent on sending a chilling warning to anyone considering taking part in future protests,\u201d Amnesty International said in a statement. Hong Kong law defines rioting as the unlawful assembly of three or more people, where any person \u201ccommits a breach of the peace\u201d. The arrests were made over peaceful protests at the weekend that turned violent, with police unleashing teargas and rubber bullets against demonstrators who hurled umbrellas, rocks, eggs and gas canisters back at officers. \u201cWhile there was violence over the weekend, the definitions of illegal assembly and rioting under Hong Kong law are so broad they fall far short of international standards,\u201d Amnesty said. \u201cIt is highly questionable that individuals facing these sweeping charges would have a fair chance of defending themselves at trial.\u201d In a sign of how broad-based support for the protests has been, the people arrested ranged from a pilot with the city\u2019s flagship airline Cathy Pacific, to a chef, an electrician and a construction worker, according to local news reports. The youngest is 16, the oldest 41. Most were released on bail of around HK$1000 (\u00a3104), with a curfew from midnight to 6am, and many ordered to stay in Hong Kong. Protests were originally spurred by concerns over a now-shelved extradition law, that would have effectively removed the legal firewall between Hong Kong and China. But they have expanded to cover fury at police brutality, and wider questions about the future of Hong Kong as an autonomous city within an ever-more assertive China. And while the riot charges and the prospect of long sentences may have alarmed some would-be protesters, for others it has just increased their fury. \u201cI\u2019m not scared to protest. This whole thing today is just making me more angry,\u201d said Gartner, a 21-year-old protester outside the court who declined to give his full name. The arrests had already spurred fresh unrest on Tuesday evening, as hundreds of protesters gathered at police stations where the group was being held, and faced riot police who deployed pepper spray and batons to try and disperse the crowd. Photos of a policeman pointing a shotgun at protesters near Kwai Chung police station circulated rapidly, spurring outrage. Police said the weapon was loaded only with non-lethal bean bags, and was being used because the officer felt under threat. In one video circulated on social media, a police officer was seen punching a photographer, then wildly waving a baton at a journalist, who was wearing a yellow vest and who was forced to flee. Outside Tin Shui Wai station, it the early hours of Wednesday morning, a private car drove by and let off fireworks towards the crowd, injuring six. There were no immediate arrests although police said they strongly condemned the attack. Adding to the sense of crisis in Hong Kong as the position of authorities and protesters appeared to harden, a senior official from Donald Trump\u2019s administration said on Wednesday that the United States was monitoring what appeared to be a buildup of Chinese forces on the border, Bloomberg news agency reported. The exact nature of the military buildup was unclear, the unnamed official said, but armed police or military appeared to be gathering just outside Hong Kong territory. China warned on Monday, in a rare direct intervention, that violent protesters should be swiftly punished. Despite peaceful protests drawing a reported 2 million people, a government official blamed the unrest on a \u201cfew radicals\u201d. \u201cNo civilised society or rule of law society will tolerate rampant violence,\u201d said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the office which handles Hong Kong and Macau events for Beijing. It was the first time the office has given a press conference since the 1997 handover from colonial rule. \u201cIn our view, the most dangerous situation in Hong Kong is that violent crimes have not been effectively stopped,\u201d he added.",

      "body": "<p>We tend to learn better from experience than from what we have simply been told. So for many in Europe, sleepless nights and suffocating buses or workplaces have helped to make real the threat posed by global heating. Now statistics are reinforcing the message. Last week the UK had the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/29/met-office-confirms-new-uk-record-temperature-of-387c\" title=\"\">hottest day on record</a>: 38.7C in Cambridge. New records were set in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands in July, and June was the hottest month in US history. The Met Office says that the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/31/uks-10-hottest-years-on-record-have-occurred-since-2002-met-office\" title=\"\">10 hottest years</a> on record have all been since 2002.</p> <p>Heatwaves naturally occur in summer, but they did not used to be so hot, or so frequent. Experts say that the UK\u2019s sweltering weather last summer was made 30 times more likely by global heating. That link has sunk in: <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/science/articles-reports/2019/07/31/most-brits-blame-climate-change-recent-heatwave\" title=\"\">in a new survey</a>, 77% believed the recent heatwave was partially or wholly caused by the climate crisis. As temperatures reach unprecedented levels, so does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/05/greta-thunberg-effect-public-concern-over-environment-reaches-record-high\" title=\"\">public concern about the environment</a>.</p> <p>Yet while global heating is just that, its impact varies even within countries. Most people <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/0p1xmjs3e8/YouGov%20-%20July%202019%20heatwave.pdf\" title=\"\">surveyed in July </a>considered the weather too hot. But, while 73% of people in the east of England judged it too hot, in chillier Scotland only 47% of people agreed \u2013 and a slightly larger proportion thought it just right or not warm enough. Some may look forward to warmer staycations and the chance to grow grapes in their back garden.</p> <p>Even those alarmed by July\u2019s heat may not envision the full scale of the climate crisis. The connection between global heating and heatwaves seems self-evident. It\u2019s intuitively harder to link it to other extreme weather events, and to take in experts\u2019 warnings that Britain seems to be getting wetter as well as warmer. It\u2019s more difficult still to fully comprehend how harsh its impact will be elsewhere.</p> <p>For many people, even a small rise in temperatures will be catastrophic. A new report from Monash University in Melbourne warns that the climate crisis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/31/climate-crisis-already-causing-deaths-and-childhood-stunting-report-reveals\" title=\"\">is already causing deaths</a>; one of its authors said almost 400 people died from heat stress and heatstroke during fires in Victoria 10 years ago. It predicts climate-related stunting, malnutrition and lower IQ in children within the coming decades; a 2018 report from the World Health Organisation predicted that an additional 250,000 deaths a year will occur between 2030 and 2050 due to global heating.</p> <p>Some places will experience more severe temperature shifts or will find it harder to adapt than others, often through lack of resources. Poorer countries, which broadly speaking are the least to blame for the climate crisis \u2013 emitting less carbon dioxide per capita \u2013 will suffer most. A hurricane or wildfire is deadlier when there is little capacity to prepare for it or to speed recovery. Families that spend most of their income on food struggle to eat when crops suffer.</p> <p>A recent study found that global heating <a href=\"https://time.com/5575523/climate-change-inequality/\" title=\"\">has already increased global inequality</a>: in most poor countries, higher temperatures are very likely to have resulted in lower economic output than they would otherwise have enjoyed, while richer nations were not harmed to the same degree, and some were potentially able to actually benefit. Bangladesh and sub-Saharan African nations are among those hit. The research ties in with previous projections that by 2100 the average income in the poorest countries will be 75% lower than it would be without climate change, and that some wealthy countries might even see higher incomes.</p> <p>Yet none of these problems will be fully contained within national borders. Drought and famine are already forcing families from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/29/guatemala-climate-crisis-migration-drought-famine\" title=\"\">attempt to migrate</a> to the United States when they are unable to feed themselves. A World Food Programme study of Central American migrants found that almost half were food insecure. A 4C rise this century, which is now considered a realistic prospect, would produce at least 300 million refugees and drown cities in the US and China. It is the duty of richer nations to do all they can to hold back the soaring temperatures which they did most to produce, and to take what action they can to mitigate their impact \u2013 abroad as well as at home. It is also in their self-interest.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We tend to learn better from experience than from what we have simply been told. So for many in Europe, sleepless nights and suffocating buses or workplaces have helped to make real the threat posed by global heating. Now statistics are reinforcing the message. Last week the UK had the hottest day on record: 38.7C in Cambridge. New records were set in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands in July, and June was the hottest month in US history. The Met Office says that the UK\u2019s 10 hottest years on record have all been since 2002. Heatwaves naturally occur in summer, but they did not used to be so hot, or so frequent. Experts say that the UK\u2019s sweltering weather last summer was made 30 times more likely by global heating. That link has sunk in: in a new survey, 77% believed the recent heatwave was partially or wholly caused by the climate crisis. As temperatures reach unprecedented levels, so does public concern about the environment. Yet while global heating is just that, its impact varies even within countries. Most people surveyed in July considered the weather too hot. But, while 73% of people in the east of England judged it too hot, in chillier Scotland only 47% of people agreed \u2013 and a slightly larger proportion thought it just right or not warm enough. Some may look forward to warmer staycations and the chance to grow grapes in their back garden. Even those alarmed by July\u2019s heat may not envision the full scale of the climate crisis. The connection between global heating and heatwaves seems self-evident. It\u2019s intuitively harder to link it to other extreme weather events, and to take in experts\u2019 warnings that Britain seems to be getting wetter as well as warmer. It\u2019s more difficult still to fully comprehend how harsh its impact will be elsewhere. For many people, even a small rise in temperatures will be catastrophic. A new report from Monash University in Melbourne warns that the climate crisis is already causing deaths; one of its authors said almost 400 people died from heat stress and heatstroke during fires in Victoria 10 years ago. It predicts climate-related stunting, malnutrition and lower IQ in children within the coming decades; a 2018 report from the World Health Organisation predicted that an additional 250,000 deaths a year will occur between 2030 and 2050 due to global heating. Some places will experience more severe temperature shifts or will find it harder to adapt than others, often through lack of resources. Poorer countries, which broadly speaking are the least to blame for the climate crisis \u2013 emitting less carbon dioxide per capita \u2013 will suffer most. A hurricane or wildfire is deadlier when there is little capacity to prepare for it or to speed recovery. Families that spend most of their income on food struggle to eat when crops suffer. A recent study found that global heating has already increased global inequality: in most poor countries, higher temperatures are very likely to have resulted in lower economic output than they would otherwise have enjoyed, while richer nations were not harmed to the same degree, and some were potentially able to actually benefit. Bangladesh and sub-Saharan African nations are among those hit. The research ties in with previous projections that by 2100 the average income in the poorest countries will be 75% lower than it would be without climate change, and that some wealthy countries might even see higher incomes. Yet none of these problems will be fully contained within national borders. Drought and famine are already forcing families from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to attempt to migrate to the United States when they are unable to feed themselves. A World Food Programme study of Central American migrants found that almost half were food insecure. A 4C rise this century, which is now considered a realistic prospect, would produce at least 300 million refugees and drown cities in the US and China. It is the duty of richer nations to do all they can to hold back the soaring temperatures which they did most to produce, and to take what action they can to mitigate their impact \u2013 abroad as well as at home. It is also in their self-interest.",

      "bodyText": "Financier Jeffrey Epstein looked physically healthy when he appeared in court in New York on Wednesday in his sex trafficking case, about a week after reportedly being found unconscious in his jail cell with neck injuries. He wore dark blue jail scrubs during his brief appearance in Manhattan federal criminal court on Wednesday morning, in a proceeding scheduled before the apparent incident behind bars last week. There were no signs of injuries that had been reported at the time and he appeared well and more neatly presented than at some previous hearings. His lawyers did not bring up the incident in court and refused to comment on the topic following the hearing, which focused on scheduling issues. Prosecutor Alison Moe asked for a June 2020 trial date to be set, telling the judge: \u201cWe don\u2019t think that any delay in this case is in the public interest.\u201d The Manhattan US attorney\u2019s office alleged earlier in July that Epstein \u201csexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\u201d from 2002 to 2005. Some of his victims were just 14 years old, prosecutors alleged. The disgraced financier, who was arrested on 6 July, pleaded not guilty several weeks ago. Epstein has long been accused of sexually abusing underage girls. He also has purported connections to Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, and moved in elite circles, including for several years in a relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late British media tycoon Robert Maxwell. Epstein and the Miami US attorney\u2019s office, headed at the time by Alexander Acosta, brokered a plea deal in 2008 that closed a federal inquiry involving at least 40 teenage girls. Under this arrangement, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges, which presented far less potential jail time than if he had faced federal charges. The Miami Herald reporter Julie K Brown exposed the secretive nature of this agreement. Acosta resigned from his post as Trump\u2019s labor secretary following extensive criticism of the deal. Epstein has unsuccessfully requested bail while awaiting trial. The 66-year-old, who registered as a sex offender following the Florida case, had maintained through lawyers that he neither posed a danger nor risk of flight. In rejecting Epstein\u2019s request, Judge Richard Berman said, \u201cthe government has established danger to others and to the community by clear and convincing evidence\u201d, adding: \u201cI doubt that any bail package can overcome a danger to the community.\u201d Epstein\u2019s lawyers are appealing against the decision, according to court filings. Late last week, Judge Berman also ruled in favor of prosecutors\u2019 proposed protective order, which will keep case materials relating to \u201cthe government\u2019s ongoing investigation of uncharged individuals\u201d under wraps.",

Just like March\u00e9 Forville in Cannes, it\u2019s a great place to people-watch and become acquainted with tasty street food. Legend has it that the batter for the local chickpea pancake, <em>socca</em>, was poured on the heads of invading Turks in the 16th century. It was later served up to peasants throughout the 19th century, as an afternoon snack or <em>merenda</em>. Socca is cooked like a crepe, costs next to nothing and is beloved by renowned chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi. The region is also home to <em>pan bagnat</em>, a sandwich made from wheat bread called pain de campagne (literally \u201cbread from the countryside\u201d), rubbed with garlic and olive oil. It\u2019s filled with the contents of salad ni\u00e7oise \u2013 boiled eggs, succulent local tomatoes, fresh tuna, anchovies (optional) and Proven\u00e7al olives \u2013 and drizzled with vinegar.</p> <p><strong>Cool off on Nice\u2019s Castle Hill<br></strong>Nice\u2019s Colline du Ch\u00e2teau once housed an impregnable fortress, which was taken down and redesigned as a park in the early 19th century for the influx of European visitors. Take the tourist train from Promenade des Anglais, ride in the lift or climb the steps (the park is 93 metres above the Baie des Anges), cooling off next to the impressive manmade waterfall, built from bricks taken from the castle\u2019s dungeon.</p> <p><strong>Visit Cannes\u2019 medieval fortress and fishing quarter<br></strong>In the 12th century, the monks built a coastal fortress called Mus\u00e9e de la Castre, which today houses an eclectic art collection. Climb its 109 steps for sublime 360-degree views over the small fishing village of Le Suquet, which grew over the course of 400 years into present-day Cannes. Today, these cobbled streets make the perfect pit stop for an affordable bite to eat.</p> <p><em>Discover the unexpected side of Nice and the </em><em>C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur region with easyJet flights from London, Bristol and Liverpool</em><em>.

Take in some literature as you rumble through the region; think Francois Sagan\u2019s Bonjour Tristesse (set on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur and one of Le Monde\u2019s 100 best books of the century) or F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s Tender is the Night, which used the majestic H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes as a backdrop. Pick up some fritters from the stalls at Condamine market in Monte Carlo for your journey; they\u2019re called Barbajuan (uncle John), named after the man who supposedly fried his ravioli when he couldn\u2019t find any sauce to accompany them. Discover traditional fishing life at Port de l\u2019Olivette The Grimaldi family\u2019s 14th-century chateau forms the cultural heart of Antibes\u2019 old town, and houses the Picasso museum, where he painted for six months in 1946. Traditional fishing still happens at Port de l\u2019Olivette, on the other side of the bay. Have a drink, watching the sailors come and go on wooden boats. Swim in Billionaires\u2019 Bay at Cap d\u2019Antibes The 5km hike from Plage de la Garoupe winds its way gently up and around Antibes\u2019 headland, over rocky outcrops and through the scent of wild herbs. Stop for a swim in Billionaires\u2019 Bay, admiring some of the most expensive houses in the region from the turquoise waters below. Tuck into street food at Nice\u2019s flower market Local farmers have been selling their wares under the striped awnings of Nice\u2019s Cours Saleya market since 1897. Just like March\u00e9 Forville in Cannes, it\u2019s a great place to people-watch and become acquainted with tasty street food. Legend has it that the batter for the local chickpea pancake, socca, was poured on the heads of invading Turks in the 16th century. It was later served up to peasants throughout the 19th century, as an afternoon snack or merenda. Socca is cooked like a crepe, costs next to nothing and is beloved by renowned chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi. The region is also home to pan bagnat, a sandwich made from wheat bread called pain de campagne (literally \u201cbread from the countryside\u201d), rubbed with garlic and olive oil. It\u2019s filled with the contents of salad ni\u00e7oise \u2013 boiled eggs, succulent local tomatoes, fresh tuna, anchovies (optional) and Proven\u00e7al olives \u2013 and drizzled with vinegar. Cool off on Nice\u2019s Castle Hill Nice\u2019s Colline du Ch\u00e2teau once housed an impregnable fortress, which was taken down and redesigned as a park in the early 19th century for the influx of European visitors. Take the tourist train from Promenade des Anglais, ride in the lift or climb the steps (the park is 93 metres above the Baie des Anges), cooling off next to the impressive manmade waterfall, built from bricks taken from the castle\u2019s dungeon. Visit Cannes\u2019 medieval fortress and fishing quarter In the 12th century, the monks built a coastal fortress called Mus\u00e9e de la Castre, which today houses an eclectic art collection. Climb its 109 steps for sublime 360-degree views over the small fishing village of Le Suquet, which grew over the course of 400 years into present-day Cannes. Today, these cobbled streets make the perfect pit stop for an affordable bite to eat.

      "body": "<p>There are the usual signs that it is getting closer. The Ashes white noise starts to fade. The Ashes hum starts to die back, wider current of Ashes anxiety to fall away. And suddenly Test cricket begins to pare itself back to the basic, atomic level business of Australian bowlers against English batsmen, Baggy Green in the field against starchy whites at the wicket. Look back and cricket\u2019s oldest two\u2011hander has so often pegged itself out this way. Hence, perhaps, the strikingly emotive response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/29/joe-root-no-3-england-ashes-australia-david-warner-bruised-thigh\" title=\"\">Joe Root\u2019s announcement that he will move up one space to bat No 3 </a>for England in Thursday\u2019s first Test at Edgbaston.</p> \n<p>It is the smallest of changes, the kind of tweak that might pass unremarked in any other less\u2011storied sport. But this is not any other sport and Root to three is a shift of England\u2019s own supporting architecture, a pre-series riposte to Australia\u2019s greatest strength, and a move that may well define how the start of this series plays out.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/31/jofra-archer-misses-out-as-broad-and-anderson-reunited-for-first-ashes-test\">Jofra Archer misses out as Broad and Anderson reunite for first Ashes Test</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Beyond this it is a change that twangs away one of the big fat major chords of cricket\u2019s most relentlessly self-mythologising contest. An England captain at No 3; a potent Aussie pace attack; five clear Ashes Tests stretching away over the dog days of late summer. This is a kind of sporting perfection.</p> \n<p>Forget the No 3 slot, which is largely an Australia-based obsession. This is a country where first drop is another of those sporting details to be tearfully fetishised, another holy relic in a place where strong, noble outdoorsy men perform valiant, nation-defining feats in the middle of all that clear-blue Australian heat, in the land of the rapidly softening new ball.</p> \n<p>The importance of English batting against Australian bowling is wider than this: not just a defining contest in most Ashes series but a dynamic that cuts across the basics of the sport and of the relations between these two nations, at least in the inflamed sporting imagination.</p> \n<p>In cricket\u2019s class structure batsmen have always been gentlemen and bowlers the players, the workers, agricultural hands there to provide the staging for their elegantly swiping lordships.

      "bodyText": "There are the usual signs that it is getting closer. The Ashes white noise starts to fade. The Ashes hum starts to die back, wider current of Ashes anxiety to fall away. And suddenly Test cricket begins to pare itself back to the basic, atomic level business of Australian bowlers against English batsmen, Baggy Green in the field against starchy whites at the wicket. Look back and cricket\u2019s oldest two\u2011hander has so often pegged itself out this way. Hence, perhaps, the strikingly emotive response to Joe Root\u2019s announcement that he will move up one space to bat No 3 for England in Thursday\u2019s first Test at Edgbaston. It is the smallest of changes, the kind of tweak that might pass unremarked in any other less\u2011storied sport. But this is not any other sport and Root to three is a shift of England\u2019s own supporting architecture, a pre-series riposte to Australia\u2019s greatest strength, and a move that may well define how the start of this series plays out. Beyond this it is a change that twangs away one of the big fat major chords of cricket\u2019s most relentlessly self-mythologising contest. An England captain at No 3; a potent Aussie pace attack; five clear Ashes Tests stretching away over the dog days of late summer. This is a kind of sporting perfection. Forget the No 3 slot, which is largely an Australia-based obsession. This is a country where first drop is another of those sporting details to be tearfully fetishised, another holy relic in a place where strong, noble outdoorsy men perform valiant, nation-defining feats in the middle of all that clear-blue Australian heat, in the land of the rapidly softening new ball. The importance of English batting against Australian bowling is wider than this: not just a defining contest in most Ashes series but a dynamic that cuts across the basics of the sport and of the relations between these two nations, at least in the inflamed sporting imagination. In cricket\u2019s class structure batsmen have always been gentlemen and bowlers the players, the workers, agricultural hands there to provide the staging for their elegantly swiping lordships. In this view of cricket bowlers are revolutionaries too, Bolsheviks inverting the class system, the only people on the pitch allowed to strike, bloody, tear down and generally overthrow their opponent, to question their basic pluck and courage. When David Warner said he saw fear in the eyes of England\u2019s No 3, Jonathan Trott, at the Gabba six years ago this was more than simply shithousery. It was cultural shithousery, something buried in the deep Australian sporting soul, the voice not only of one crowing Australian, but of those that crowed before him, the noble dead, stretching right back through these generational collisions. In an interesting twist the two series the English tend to remember, the Bodyline tour and the 2005 Ashes, were thrilling inversions of this dynamic, with English fast bowlers mimicking Australian aggression. Either side there is a history of English resistance to Australian fire, from Hobbs and Sutcliffe putting on 105 on a Melbourne sticky, watched by a captivated Don Bradman, and discussed in print 60 years later by Richie Benaud (one of the most holy Australian moments in all Australian cricketdom, a vast groaning six\u2011tier cake of Baggie Green goodness) through to Lillee and Thomson and their gleefully punkish acts of high-speed vandalism against a particularly baleful and doomed England order. Ever since then the fate of most Ashes series has been defined by England\u2019s ability to resist this force: from Warne, McGrath and Lee, to Harris and Johnson and now to Cummins, Starc and Pattinson. And so back to Root and to No 3. There has been a degree of weary harrumphing at his unwillingness to move up the order. It is an easy point to make. What\u2019s one spot? What relevance could three or four have when the real variables are pitches and bowlers and shine on the ball? What difference does it make when England have been opening the batting with a series of interchangeable polystyrene tailors\u2019 mannequins for the past three years? But Root is right.

This could be a defining series for England\u2019s captain, in a format and a contest where so often how a player feels, the idea of being settled, of being able to channel energy the right way, has made such a difference. Top-order Test batting is a complex business, a matter of angles and pressure, just as in England the job of a No 3 is different, less about walking out and leading from the front, more about defence and protection and adaptability. There are two other key points about that move and about the need for Root to be sure. First, it is striking just how much better he is than everyone else in England\u2019s batting. Nobody else in that top eight averages anywhere near 40, bar Jason Roy\u2019s one-Test effort. Root averages 49.

The spectacle of one English batsman leading the way has been a theme from David Gower\u2019s majestic floppy\u2011hatted brutality at No 3 in 1985 to three hundreds in the series for Chris Broad opening in 1986\u201187; to Ian Bell\u2019s wonderful stand-alone hundreds at Trent Bridge, Lord\u2019s and Chester Le-Street at No 5 in 2013. This time around England\u2019s batting is power-packed but undeniably brittle, part of the wider tide of first-class cricket around the world. The Test team has given a debut to six top-order batsmen in the past two years. None has yet made a hundred. The default opener Rory Burns has spent time this week at Surrey with Neil Stewart, his youth team coach, working on the basics of batting and a technique that when it goes, really goes. Alongside him Jason Roy will attack every time, even if attacking is only selectively the right thing to do. England have the capacity to fall apart like an overly dunked digestive biscuit against a fine, high-pace Australian attack. Pat Cummins has 94 Test wickets at 22, James Pattinson 70 at 26. They have one possible weakness. They have played two Tests in England between them. They will face in Root a No 3 who averages 54 at home; who has 11 hundreds in 43 Tests in England; and who must feel there is an edge to be seized or lost by thrusting himself forward to meet the challenge.

      "bodyText": "Ladbrokes Coral will pay a \u00a35.9m penalty, one of the largest imposed by the Gambling Commission, over \u201csystemic failings\u201d to protect problem gamblers who lost hundreds of thousands of pounds. The regulator detailed a litany of transgressions by Ladbrokes Coral between 2014 and 2017, finding that it failed to fulfil its obligations to \u201cprotect customers from gambling harm\u201d and prevent money laundering. When the company became aware of the problem, it simply reduced the number of its customers it deemed \u201chigh risk\u201d, rather than investing to protect them the commission\u2019s investigation found. \u201cThese were systemic failings at a large operator, which resulted in consumers being harmed and stolen money flowing though the business and this is unacceptable,\u201d the commission\u2019s executive director, Richard Watson, said. The failures include neglecting to ask one customer who lost \u00a31.5m over three years about their source of funds, despite clear signs of problem gambling such as logging into their account 10 times a day and losing \u00a364,000 in a month. Ladbrokes did not ask any questions of another customer who lost \u00a398,000 over two and a half years, had 460 attempted deposits declined and even asked the operator to stop sending them marketing promotions. The bookmaker, owned by Isle of Man-based firm GVC, also failed to intervene when customer who deposited more than \u00a3140,000 in the first four months of their account being open. The commission said that in one case Ladbrokes identified \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about a customer but continued to allow them to place large wagers. The failings continued even after the company and its management should have known about them, the Commission said, adding that it was still investigating individuals who could lose their licence to operate in the industry. As part of the settlement GVC will pay \u00a34.8m towards responsible gambling causes and will forfeit \u00a31.1m to \u201caffected parties\u201d. It will also review the top 50 customers for the years 2015-17 to consider whether any further failings can be identified.

He lists three priorities: second referendum and remain; spend focused on those most in need; and address the traditional Labour heartlands that have been hardest hit by years of Tory austerity.</p> <p>Clearly these are linked. There are other priorities, too, but I would highlight just one, a fourth, which again is integrally connected to Chakrabortty\u2019s points: democratisation. Isn\u2019t this the moment to grasp the nettle and to reconfigure our failing democracy? Local government has been crushed and must be reinvigorated. The Lords must be replaced by a democratically elected second chamber. The first-past-the-post electoral system has passed its sell-by date: time for proportional representation. And of course there\u2019s more: Labour should commit to wholesale constitutional reform having initiated citizens\u2019 assemblies to flesh out the details.</p> <p>The coming general election is a real \u201c1945 moment\u201d, or could be if Labour wins. The thought of losing is simply unbearable.<br><strong>Jol Miskin</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 Alastair Cambell\u2019s editorship of the New European seems to have clouded his previous electoral intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/29/jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-brexit\" title=\"\">An open letter to Corbyn: why I have to quit your party</a>, Journal, 30 July). Could he explain how embracing the remain and referendum position he advocates would make Labour \u201cpoised to win an election\u201d? If Labour did so, it risks failing to win the crucial 30-odd marginal leave-voting constituencies from the Tories and also losing to them 30 Labour-held marginals that voted leave in 2017. The position recommended would deny Labour all these marginals and destroy its chance of winning an election; and almost guarantee the return of a Johnson government.<br><strong>Bryn Jones</strong><br><em>Bath</em></p> <p>\u2022 Alastair Campbell states his concern with, among other issues, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stance on Brexit. As a Labour party member I agree, but I appreciate how difficult an issue it is for the party given the numbers of Labour voters who want to leave the EU. I also wonder how New Labour under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and advised by Campbell would have reacted given their instinct for triangulation when confronted with difficult polling data. Perhaps Alastair should reflect on New Labour\u2019s record on joining the euro, the key EU issue of the day, which was ducked because of hostile public opinion whipped up by the Tory right despite firm evidence of the prospect of increased trade with the eurozone and increased though modest growth in GDP.<br><strong>Steve Flatley</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p>\u2022 If Labour loses the next election, it will be largely due to the ongoing lack of support from people like Alastair Campbell, who has chosen to undermine him at every step, rather than capitalise on Corbyn\u2019s initial success in attracting several hundred thousand new members and promoting policies which appeal to principled and idealistic younger voters. When Labour is the only party with a hope of creating a fairer and better society, why does the Guardian persist in giving Campbell column inches, even on the front page, and topping the list of articles in the Journal section? With his support for the Iraq war, dodgy dossier, Tory-lite policies and abrasive style, for which I have never heard a glimmer of apology, Campbell seems to me to have done more real harm to the Labour cause than Jeremy Corbyn.<br><strong>Eleanor Ellington</strong><br><em>Bath</em></p> <p>\u2022 A Labour party without Alastair Campbell is like a Republican party without Richard Nixon: improved. Campbell should reflect on how Blairite neoliberalism, making only minor changes in the Thatcher-era political settlement and proclaiming itself to be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/26/mandelson-people-getting-filthy-rich\" title=\"\">intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes</a>\u201d while allowing instant access to Britain for low-skilled workers from the EU accession countries of Bulgaria and Romania to delight New Labour\u2019s friends in business and the political correctness lobby, meanwhile assuming that Labour\u2019s traditional voters had nowhere to go, has brought us to the current situation.<br><strong>Christopher Clayton</strong><br><em>Chester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Campbell says Labour has been \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/30/boris-johnson-prime-minister-brexit-news-warned-no-deal-brexit-could-lead-to-farmers-blocking-roads-in-protest-live-news?page=with:block-5d4013928f08cf92bb7799de#block-5d4013928f08cf92bb7799de\" title=\"\">taken over by people who until recently were communists, they were Stalinists, and they still are</a>\u201d. Such ideologies are anathema to me and I\u2019m sure to the thousands of other members who simply want to see policies that are rooted in fairness brought back to mainstream politics. Policies not like PFI, created by Blair, but proper state ownership of the NHS and social care. Policies like public ownership of utilities (that we all once owned before they were stolen by Thatcher) that plough profits back into investment into the service instead of giving dividends to shareholders, policies like fair taxation properly enforced, policies that redress the imbalance in funding between private and state education. These are policies that Attlee (onto whom Campbell projects his view) would advocate, not fear. These are policies that would benefit the majority of citizens and not just the wealthy.<br><strong>Andy Burge</strong><br><em>Hertford</em></p> <p>\u2022 \u201cRemember Iraq?\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/30/finding-ones-place-on-the-spectrum\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 31 July) has became the kneejerk riposte to anyone referencing the pre-Corbyn era. Yes, I remember Iraq.

      "bodyText": "Well said, Aditya Chakrabortty (Labour risks total wipeout if it fails to see Johnson threat, 31 July). He lists three priorities: second referendum and remain; spend focused on those most in need; and address the traditional Labour heartlands that have been hardest hit by years of Tory austerity. Clearly these are linked. There are other priorities, too, but I would highlight just one, a fourth, which again is integrally connected to Chakrabortty\u2019s points: democratisation. Isn\u2019t this the moment to grasp the nettle and to reconfigure our failing democracy? Local government has been crushed and must be reinvigorated. The Lords must be replaced by a democratically elected second chamber. The first-past-the-post electoral system has passed its sell-by date: time for proportional representation. And of course there\u2019s more: Labour should commit to wholesale constitutional reform having initiated citizens\u2019 assemblies to flesh out the details. The coming general election is a real \u201c1945 moment\u201d, or could be if Labour wins. The thought of losing is simply unbearable. Jol Miskin Sheffield \u2022 Alastair Cambell\u2019s editorship of the New European seems to have clouded his previous electoral intelligence (An open letter to Corbyn: why I have to quit your party, Journal, 30 July). Could he explain how embracing the remain and referendum position he advocates would make Labour \u201cpoised to win an election\u201d? If Labour did so, it risks failing to win the crucial 30-odd marginal leave-voting constituencies from the Tories and also losing to them 30 Labour-held marginals that voted leave in 2017. The position recommended would deny Labour all these marginals and destroy its chance of winning an election; and almost guarantee the return of a Johnson government. Bryn Jones Bath \u2022 Alastair Campbell states his concern with, among other issues, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stance on Brexit. As a Labour party member I agree, but I appreciate how difficult an issue it is for the party given the numbers of Labour voters who want to leave the EU. I also wonder how New Labour under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and advised by Campbell would have reacted given their instinct for triangulation when confronted with difficult polling data. Perhaps Alastair should reflect on New Labour\u2019s record on joining the euro, the key EU issue of the day, which was ducked because of hostile public opinion whipped up by the Tory right despite firm evidence of the prospect of increased trade with the eurozone and increased though modest growth in GDP. Steve Flatley York \u2022 If Labour loses the next election, it will be largely due to the ongoing lack of support from people like Alastair Campbell, who has chosen to undermine him at every step, rather than capitalise on Corbyn\u2019s initial success in attracting several hundred thousand new members and promoting policies which appeal to principled and idealistic younger voters. When Labour is the only party with a hope of creating a fairer and better society, why does the Guardian persist in giving Campbell column inches, even on the front page, and topping the list of articles in the Journal section? With his support for the Iraq war, dodgy dossier, Tory-lite policies and abrasive style, for which I have never heard a glimmer of apology, Campbell seems to me to have done more real harm to the Labour cause than Jeremy Corbyn. Eleanor Ellington Bath \u2022 A Labour party without Alastair Campbell is like a Republican party without Richard Nixon: improved. Campbell should reflect on how Blairite neoliberalism, making only minor changes in the Thatcher-era political settlement and proclaiming itself to be \u201cintensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes\u201d while allowing instant access to Britain for low-skilled workers from the EU accession countries of Bulgaria and Romania to delight New Labour\u2019s friends in business and the political correctness lobby, meanwhile assuming that Labour\u2019s traditional voters had nowhere to go, has brought us to the current situation. Christopher Clayton Chester \u2022 Campbell says Labour has been \u201ctaken over by people who until recently were communists, they were Stalinists, and they still are\u201d. Such ideologies are anathema to me and I\u2019m sure to the thousands of other members who simply want to see policies that are rooted in fairness brought back to mainstream politics. Policies not like PFI, created by Blair, but proper state ownership of the NHS and social care. Policies like public ownership of utilities (that we all once owned before they were stolen by Thatcher) that plough profits back into investment into the service instead of giving dividends to shareholders, policies like fair taxation properly enforced, policies that redress the imbalance in funding between private and state education. These are policies that Attlee (onto whom Campbell projects his view) would advocate, not fear. These are policies that would benefit the majority of citizens and not just the wealthy. Andy Burge Hertford \u2022 \u201cRemember Iraq?\u201d (Letters, 31 July) has became the kneejerk riposte to anyone referencing the pre-Corbyn era. Yes, I remember Iraq. But I also remember three consecutive Labour landslide election victories, when the defeat of the Tories meant peace in Northern Ireland, hospital waiting lists down, education spending up and knowing that a Labour vote actually meant something.

In its founding year he led the editorial team of Undercurrents (known affectionately as Undies) to the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, where they distributed a special issue on energy and organised an exhibition on alternative technologies. The publication lasted 10 years before merging with Resurgence magazine.</p> <p>In 1975 Godfrey co-edited (with Peter Harper) Radical Technology, a book with contributions from many of the Undies stable that was perhaps best known for the series of Visions drawings by the anarchist artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/clifford-harper\" title=\"\">Clifford Harper</a>. In the same year Godfrey published his influential book Living on the Sun, which advanced the then novel idea that industrial countries could make a transition to renewable power.</p> <p>In 1976 he joined the Open University, where he created and led the Alternative Technology Group (later the Energy and Environment Research Unit), which pioneered teaching and research into renewable energy. His own research concentrated on wind and solar systems (and involved some fun with early electric bikes). He edited the first three editions (1996, 2004, 2012) of Renewable Energy: Power for a Sustainable Future, the bestselling introductory textbook on renewable energy.</p> <p>Godfrey was born in Brentford, west London, to Kevin Boyle, a quantity surveyor, and his wife, Phyllis (nee Snodgrass). The family moved when Godfrey was a baby to Belfast, where he and his sister, Mary, grew up, and where Godfrey was educated at St Malachy\u2019s college. He enrolled for an electrical engineering degree at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, where he ran societies, published alternative magazines, and was part of a small group of techies who ran a pirate radio station. Unfortunately he failed his finals, and when he was awarded an OU personal chair in 2009, he became perhaps the only professor in the UK without a degree.</p> <p>Moving to London from Belfast, he worked as a journalist on Electronics Weekly, where he met Sally Maloney, whom he married in 1973. Sally did the graphic design and layout for Undercurrents. They had two children, Holly and Katie, and settled in Milton Keynes, living as part of the <a href=\"https://www.diggersanddreamers.org.uk/communities/existing/rainbow-housing-co-operative\" title=\"\">Rainbow Housing Cooperative</a> that Godfrey was instrumental in establishing. They divorced in 1992. In later years Godfrey lived in London and Devon with his partner, Romy Fraser.</p> <p>He loved music, especially jazz, and played the keyboard, harmonica and accordion in an OU band, Wimpey 3. He visited Glastonbury festival for many years and until the end of his life enjoyed being introduced to new music. </p> <p>He is survived by Romy, Holly, Katie and four grandchildren.</p>",

In the same year Godfrey published his influential book Living on the Sun, which advanced the then novel idea that industrial countries could make a transition to renewable power. In 1976 he joined the Open University, where he created and led the Alternative Technology Group (later the Energy and Environment Research Unit), which pioneered teaching and research into renewable energy. His own research concentrated on wind and solar systems (and involved some fun with early electric bikes). He edited the first three editions (1996, 2004, 2012) of Renewable Energy: Power for a Sustainable Future, the bestselling introductory textbook on renewable energy. Godfrey was born in Brentford, west London, to Kevin Boyle, a quantity surveyor, and his wife, Phyllis (nee Snodgrass). The family moved when Godfrey was a baby to Belfast, where he and his sister, Mary, grew up, and where Godfrey was educated at St Malachy\u2019s college. He enrolled for an electrical engineering degree at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, where he ran societies, published alternative magazines, and was part of a small group of techies who ran a pirate radio station. Unfortunately he failed his finals, and when he was awarded an OU personal chair in 2009, he became perhaps the only professor in the UK without a degree. Moving to London from Belfast, he worked as a journalist on Electronics Weekly, where he met Sally Maloney, whom he married in 1973. Sally did the graphic design and layout for Undercurrents. They had two children, Holly and Katie, and settled in Milton Keynes, living as part of the Rainbow Housing Cooperative that Godfrey was instrumental in establishing. They divorced in 1992. In later years Godfrey lived in London and Devon with his partner, Romy Fraser. He loved music, especially jazz, and played the keyboard, harmonica and accordion in an OU band, Wimpey 3. He visited Glastonbury festival for many years and until the end of his life enjoyed being introduced to new music. He is survived by Romy, Holly, Katie and four grandchildren.",

      "body": "<p>Though Julia Farron, who has died aged 96, was recognised as one of the most versatile, intelligent and valued members of the company now known as the Royal Ballet, her career did not follow the obvious pattern of rising from the ranks of the corps de ballet to dance Odette/Odile, Aurora and Juliet. Indeed, she did not perform any of these roles during her time with the Royal Ballet\u2019s predecessor companies, the Vic-Wells and Sadler\u2019s Wells, from the late 1930s onwards, or from its inception in 1956 until her official retirement, or appearances after it in the 1960s.</p> <p>Rather, she was a great tackler of recently created virtuoso roles, even in 1951 being thrown on at the last minute as ballerina in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/jan/08/dance1\" title=\"\">George Balanchine</a>\u2019s challenging Ballet Imperial, a work in which she otherwise loved leading the corps de ballet. But while most dancers move towards <a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/news/cracking-the-code-the-meaning-of-mime-in-ballet\" title=\"\">mime roles</a> such as the Queen in The Sleeping Beauty as a sequel to dancing virtuoso solos, she was the graceful and elegant, albeit young, Queen when <a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/news/awakening-the-sleeping-beauty-re-opening-the-royal-opera-house-after-world-war-ii\" title=\"\">the Sadler\u2019s Wells Ballet reopened the Royal Opera House in 1946</a>. Six years later she was dancing the second girl in the Florestan pas de trois in the same work so precisely and buoyantly that it sparkled with an entirely new brilliance.</p> <p>As she went on as a performer, she created more substantial roles. Among these were the narrow-minded, jealous, puritanical Hannah in Mirror for Witches (1952) and the lively Tarantella on Veneziana (1953), both choreographed by Andr\u00e9e Howard, and for John Cranko the dramatic Princess Belle Epine in Benjamin Britten\u2019s The Prince of the Pagodas (1957), and Jocasta in Antigone (1959).</p> <p>Farron took on roles that relied on characterisation and drama as well as dance, and she had the ability to make them her own. The ballet photographer Gordon Anthony claimed that when she took over the ghostly role of Alicia from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Alicia Markova</a> in The Haunted Ballroom, created by his sister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/09/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Ninette de Valois</a>, the character changed from ethereal to more vicious: where Markova was ectoplasm Farron was a poltergeist. Farron was more successful than Margot Fonteyn as the vivacious Mam\u2019zelle Angot in L\u00e9onide Massine\u2019s ballet, and in Robert Helpmann\u2019s The Miracle in the Gorbals (1945) her Prostitute was more voluptuous, if less exotic and flamboyant, than those of other interpreters. She also brought tenderness and conviction to the scene of her conversion at the end of that ballet.</p> <p>Born Joyce Farron-Smith in London, she was the daughter of Hugh Farron-Smith, a civil servant, and his wife, Amy (nee Ellis), a teacher. She began her training at the Cone school in London, and became one of the first pupils to win a scholarship to the Vic-Wells school in London, from which she graduated into the Vic-Wells ballet company at the age of 14, having undoubtedly benefited from the training of the 1930s, which combined fast, detailed footwork with generous use of the upper body. De Valois was the director of the Vic-Wells company, and in 1937 persuaded Joyce to change her name to Julia and drop Smith from her surname. </p> <p>Her performing career began with the role of a dancing snowflake in a pantomime Cinderella at Drury Lane during its 1934-35 run. The following Christmas she was Will o\u2019 the Wisp in the children\u2019s production of Bluebell in Fairy Land at the Scala theatre, London. By this time she had also performed as Clara in The Nutcracker and Little Bo-Peep in De Valois\u2019s Nursery Suite.</p> <p>As a member of the Vic-Wells company she danced in many of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/frederickashton\" title=\"\">Frederick Ashton</a>\u2019s ballets: as a Bridesmaid in Ashton\u2019s Le Baiser de la F\u00e9e, a Belfry Spirit in Apparitions, and famously as the smallest dancer in the company she created the role of P\u00e9p\u00e9 the dog in Ashton\u2019s anarchic A Wedding Bouquet, set to Lord Berners\u2019 rendition of Gertrude Stein\u2019s text, all in 1936. That year, too, she danced in a performance of Wagner\u2019s opera Tannh\u00e4user during which an on-stage fountain leaked and the bacchanal was performed ankle-deep in water.</p> <p>In 1939 it appeared that Farron would have a breakthrough when Ashton chose her to lead the cast in Cupid and Psyche. However, although he used her soft, fluid style to good effect and included choreographically interesting material such as his ballerina\u2019s \u201cwalking on air\u201d motif for the first time, the ballet itself was one of his rare disasters. </p> <p>She toured with Sadler\u2019s Wells Ballet throughout the second world war, including one visit <a href=\"https://islingtonblogs.typepad.com/sadlers-wells-archive/ballet/page/2/\" title=\"\">to the Netherlands</a> that was cut short as German troops invaded, and in roles such as Mademoiselle Theodore in The Prospect Before Us and the Betrayed Girl in The Rake\u2019s Progress. Along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/beryl-grey\" title=\"\">Beryl Grey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/02/dame-gillian-lynne-obituary\" title=\"\">Gillian Lynne</a> and other colleagues, she recalled the period in David Bintley\u2019s BBC Four film <a href=\"http://www.balletnews.co.uk/dancing-in-the-blitz-how-ww2-made-british-ballet/\" title=\"\">Dancing in the Blitz: How World War II Made British Ballet</a> (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01s4z2h\" title=\"\">2014</a>). </p> <p>After the war, Farron began performing with the South African choreographer and dancer Alfred Rodriguez, whom she married in 1948. She missed the Sadler\u2019s Wells conquest of New York in 1949 owing to the birth of her son, Christopher, but Ashton continued to choreograph for her after the war, including in the cameo role of vengeful Diana in Sylvia (1952) and in the dazzling Neapolitan Dance added to Swan Lake, which was so successful that it continues to be included in new productions. In 1958, by which time Sadler\u2019s Wells had become the Royal Ballet, Ashton also showcased her as the deserted Bertha in Ondine.</p> <p>Her official retirement from the ballet stage came in the summer of 1961, but she would return as a guest to the Royal Ballet throughout the 1960s, creating Lady Capulet in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kenneth-macmillan\" title=\"\">Kenneth MacMillan</a>\u2019s Romeo and Juliet (1965) and taking on the role of the venomous fairy Carabosse in <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/peter-wright\" title=\"\">Peter Wright</a>\u2019s staging of The Sleeping Beauty (1968).</p> <p>She also became an inspiring teacher at the Royal Ballet School (1964-82), before moving to the Royal Academy of Dance, where she was assistant director (1982-83) and director (1983-89).

      "body": "<p>Kate Turner is aware that the chalkboard meal-planner in her Sussex kitchen can bewilder visitors. \u201cFriends come round and go: \u2018Wow, my God!\u2019,\u201d says the author of My Zero-Waste Kitchen. That breakfast, lunch and dinner wallchart (Wednesday: porridge; Dad\u2019s salad; pilaf; Thursday: cereal, tuna sandwiches; spinach pie) may look overwhelming, but Turner insists: \u201cIt\u2019s not scary. Not having to think about what you\u2019re cooking is liberating. It saves money, time and stress.\u201d</p> <p>Meal-planning has a way to go before it becomes mainstream, but it has long been a hit with weight-loss experts and wellness gurus, and the growing desire to cut food waste has led to a new wave of interest.</p> <p>True, using every scrap of your shopping across purposefully planned meals is a habit you have to develop. But whether you cook complex dishes from scratch every night or are more of a pasta-and-sauce person, to Turner, planning makes unbeatable ecological and financial sense. \u201cIf you\u2019re wasting food, you\u2019re wasting money,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m really keen this isn\u2019t seen as a middle-class hobby. It\u2019s a money-saver for anybody.\u201d</p> <p>But where do you start? Here are 10 tips from experts.</p> <h2><strong>Plan your week in food</strong></h2> <p>Whether you use a Google doc, a spreadsheet, a magnetic fridge whiteboard or a simple notepad, you first need to setup a seven-day planner that you can easily edit \u2013 one week being a reasonable timeframe in which to use fresh ingredients before they spoil. If you prefer, there are apps (Yummly, SideChef, Smart Recipes) that can help you pick meals and recipes and generate shopping lists.</p> <p>Make it enjoyable, urges the chef <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/20/miguel-barclay-one-pound-meals-budget-friendly-lunch-dinner-recipes\" title=\"\">Miguel Barclay, the author of One Pound Meals</a>: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to start on Monday. Start on Friday night\u2019s curry if that\u2019s the meal you look forward to most, or Sunday roast if that\u2019s non-negotiable. If cooking\u2019s not exciting, in six months you\u2019ll be back on takeaways.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Allow for real life</strong></h2> <p>A meal plan should not dictate your life. As you plan, jot down what you are doing each day (meeting mates for a drink after work, picking the kids up late from football) and think about what time you have to cook, if at all. Working across seven days gives you flexibility. You can stay late in the pub or order a takeaway on a whim without creating disastrous waste. \u201cI can\u2019t be rigid about it,\u201d says Turner. \u201cWork and family life don\u2019t allow for that. If meals get shunted around the week, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Find your MO</strong></h2> <p>Food offers infinite possibilities. To write a quick meal plan, you need to narrow them down, establishing a framework that works for you. You might start by choosing three meats a week, from a whole chicken to a pack of bacon, then select recipes that use those meats across two or three different meals. Or you might be led by leftovers: select three main meals you love, then choose recipes for the other days that use up any raw or cooked remants. Cooking dinner plus an extra portion for lunch at work the next day is a third way to minimise cost and waste. \u201cThat way you only have to plan seven dinners and two lunches each week, on Saturday and Sunday, which simplifies everything,\u201d says Limahl Asmall, the author of Tiny Budget Cooking.</p> <p>In choosing meats, think about leftovers. You can use cold roast beef as pie filling or in a sandwich but, arguably, it\u2019s less user-friendly than leftover roast chicken, which can be used shredded in stir-fries, or in soups and salads.</p> <p>Another useful discipline is to stick to one type of cuisine each week (Indian, Italian, Chinese), so you don\u2019t end up having to use leftover pak choi in a lasagne. \u201cIf you do Thai on Tuesday and pizza on Wednesday, you\u2019ll have waste,\u201d says Rachel Beckwith, the family editor at BBC Good Food magazine.</p> <h2><strong>Embrace the internet</strong></h2> <p>\u201cWhatever I\u2019ve got left over from my last dish, I use as the first piece of the jigsaw for my next recipe,\u201d says Barclay, a pro chef with a vast mental Rolodex of ideas to draw on. But where should the rest of us look for inspiration? \u201cType \u2018leftover chicken recipes\u2019 into Google,\u201d he suggests. \u201cThere\u2019s the 10 best leftover chicken recipes, pictures, everything.

      "bodyText": "Kate Turner is aware that the chalkboard meal-planner in her Sussex kitchen can bewilder visitors. \u201cFriends come round and go: \u2018Wow, my God!\u2019,\u201d says the author of My Zero-Waste Kitchen. That breakfast, lunch and dinner wallchart (Wednesday: porridge; Dad\u2019s salad; pilaf; Thursday: cereal, tuna sandwiches; spinach pie) may look overwhelming, but Turner insists: \u201cIt\u2019s not scary. Not having to think about what you\u2019re cooking is liberating. It saves money, time and stress.\u201d Meal-planning has a way to go before it becomes mainstream, but it has long been a hit with weight-loss experts and wellness gurus, and the growing desire to cut food waste has led to a new wave of interest. True, using every scrap of your shopping across purposefully planned meals is a habit you have to develop. But whether you cook complex dishes from scratch every night or are more of a pasta-and-sauce person, to Turner, planning makes unbeatable ecological and financial sense. \u201cIf you\u2019re wasting food, you\u2019re wasting money,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m really keen this isn\u2019t seen as a middle-class hobby. It\u2019s a money-saver for anybody.\u201d But where do you start? Here are 10 tips from experts. Plan your week in food Whether you use a Google doc, a spreadsheet, a magnetic fridge whiteboard or a simple notepad, you first need to setup a seven-day planner that you can easily edit \u2013 one week being a reasonable timeframe in which to use fresh ingredients before they spoil. If you prefer, there are apps (Yummly, SideChef, Smart Recipes) that can help you pick meals and recipes and generate shopping lists. Make it enjoyable, urges the chef Miguel Barclay, the author of One Pound Meals: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to start on Monday. Start on Friday night\u2019s curry if that\u2019s the meal you look forward to most, or Sunday roast if that\u2019s non-negotiable. If cooking\u2019s not exciting, in six months you\u2019ll be back on takeaways.\u201d Allow for real life A meal plan should not dictate your life. As you plan, jot down what you are doing each day (meeting mates for a drink after work, picking the kids up late from football) and think about what time you have to cook, if at all. Working across seven days gives you flexibility. You can stay late in the pub or order a takeaway on a whim without creating disastrous waste. \u201cI can\u2019t be rigid about it,\u201d says Turner. \u201cWork and family life don\u2019t allow for that. If meals get shunted around the week, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Find your MO Food offers infinite possibilities. To write a quick meal plan, you need to narrow them down, establishing a framework that works for you. You might start by choosing three meats a week, from a whole chicken to a pack of bacon, then select recipes that use those meats across two or three different meals. Or you might be led by leftovers: select three main meals you love, then choose recipes for the other days that use up any raw or cooked remants. Cooking dinner plus an extra portion for lunch at work the next day is a third way to minimise cost and waste. \u201cThat way you only have to plan seven dinners and two lunches each week, on Saturday and Sunday, which simplifies everything,\u201d says Limahl Asmall, the author of Tiny Budget Cooking. In choosing meats, think about leftovers. You can use cold roast beef as pie filling or in a sandwich but, arguably, it\u2019s less user-friendly than leftover roast chicken, which can be used shredded in stir-fries, or in soups and salads. Another useful discipline is to stick to one type of cuisine each week (Indian, Italian, Chinese), so you don\u2019t end up having to use leftover pak choi in a lasagne. \u201cIf you do Thai on Tuesday and pizza on Wednesday, you\u2019ll have waste,\u201d says Rachel Beckwith, the family editor at BBC Good Food magazine. Embrace the internet \u201cWhatever I\u2019ve got left over from my last dish, I use as the first piece of the jigsaw for my next recipe,\u201d says Barclay, a pro chef with a vast mental Rolodex of ideas to draw on. But where should the rest of us look for inspiration? \u201cType \u2018leftover chicken recipes\u2019 into Google,\u201d he suggests. \u201cThere\u2019s the 10 best leftover chicken recipes, pictures, everything. There is no secret to finding recipes: just type it into Google, pick one, move on. Google are trying to make driverless cars. Do you not think they moved on to that after they sorted out the leftover-chicken recipes?\u201d Build a staples cupboard It needn\u2019t be huge, but put together a store cupboard of basic carbs (dried pasta, lentils, rice); flavourings (soy sauce, stock cubes, dry herbs, spices); tins (pulses, tomatoes, tuna); and frozen veg, such as peas. You will be ready to tackle most planned meals. Check your fridge before you shop According to Love Food Hate Waste, 30% of people don\u2019t; almost half of us forget to check the freezer; and 44% of 18 to 34-year-olds go shopping without making a list. Browsing online can be helpful by showing you pack sizes as you write your meal plan, but deliveries can often include short-dated products or already ripe fruit that you need to speed-eat, disrupting that plan. Instead, shop in person, ideally somewhere you can weigh out the ingredients you need. Write your shopping list in a rough date order as a reminder to buy items with a longer sell-by date that you plan to use later in the week. Choose any deals wisely, warns Beckwith. \u201cIt\u2019s a false economy if you buy something two-for-one and it goes bad in the fridge. Supermarkets want you to pay for that wastage.\u201d Buy big, versatile flavours \u201cChorizo and bacon are perfect examples,\u201d says Barclay. \u201cA little goes a long way, whereas something like steak is very poor value.\u201d Treat yourself early in the week Use prime ingredients with a short shelf-life early, as through the week you will accumulate leftovers that require retooling \u2013 into a sausage, tomato and cabbage chilli pasta, say, or a one-pot stew. \u201cI use more curries and bolognese-type recipes at the end of the week, where it doesn\u2019t show if a courgette\u2019s gone past its best. It\u2019s more forgiving, especially things with spices,\u201d says Beckwith. The freezer is your friend A well-organised freezer is the bedrock of minimal-waste meal planning. It allows you to save most leftovers or tired, withering items (bananas, pureed fruits, chopped onions and garlic, herbs blitzed into a pesto etc), and maintain a stash of meals to fall back on when you are too busy or cannot be mithered cooking. How you store things is a matter of taste and budget (reusable zip-lock bags, Tupperware, recycled plastic takeaway containers), but clearly label everything, including the date frozen and ideal use-by date, which will usually be within three months. Make the most of the weekend \u201cAn hour or two of prep each weekend (making meals for the freezer or, perhaps cooking mince that you can turn into a shepherd\u2019s pie) will make it far more likely that you stick to your meal plan during the week. A warning: test any recipes before you XXL them. Making a huge vat of revolting veggie chilli for the freezer that you reluctantly trudge through over several weeks will definitely erode your enthusiasm for this whole meal-planning malarkey.",

      "body": "<p>It is one of nature\u2019s cruellest jokes: by the time we are old enough to be entrusted with eyebrows, we have often already ruined them. The effects of improper eyebrow maintenance in our teenage years may last a lifetime; a battlefield massacre you see reflected back at you every time you look in the mirror.</p> <p>But even into adulthood, eyebrow-related mishaps may occur. This week, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/9605818/angry-bird-beautician-botched-eyebrows-holiday/\">the Sun reported</a> that 37-year-old Colline Rees from Llanelli, south Wales, had a family holiday ruined after a botched eyebrow treatment left her too embarrassed to pose for photos. After a trainee therapist accidentally waxed off most of her right eyebrow, the salon attempted to fix the mistake by painting thick, black dye on Rees\u2019s brows. \u201cAll my close friends and family were saying I look like something out of the Angry Birds,\u201d Rees said.</p> <p>At least Rees was left with eyebrows \u2013 sort of. When Hattie Grylls decided to shape her eyebrows while on a family holiday aged 13, her dad\u2019s rusty old razor was the closest implement to hand. The 26-year-old Londoner, who works in publishing, says: \u201cI still get a rash from embarrassment just thinking about it.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, thin eyebrows were in vogue. \u201cI\u2019d just started shaving my legs and got my period. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m a woman now.\u2019\u201d Plus, Grylls had started a tentative holiday romance with a boy called Alex, and she hoped her new, adult eyebrows would seal the deal.</p> <p>\u201cI was trying to do it methodically,\u201d Grylls says. The trouble is, a razor isn\u2019t that precise. \u201cI\u2019d overdo it on one side, so I\u2019d do a bit more to even it out on the other side.\u201d Reader, she shaved her eyebrows off.</p> <p>After surveying the damage to her face, Grylls borrowed her mum\u2019s eyeliner, drew them back on, and went downstairs for lunch. \u201cDad said: \u2018You\u2019re never using my razor again.\u2019\u201d It wasn\u2019t all bad: even sans eyebrows, Grylls managed to kiss Alex later that week.</p> <p>Not all victims are so lucky. When Ben Horsley-Summer was 20, he was into \u201cshouty\u201d music, and had a face full of piercings and long black hair to boot. Two eyebrow piercings in an unusual place \u2013 the centre of his brows, directly above his pupils \u2013 seemed like a good bet.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be a bit different,\u201d Horsley-Summer, a 34-year-old marketing manager from Guildford, recalls. \u201cGet something no one else has. The guy in the piercing shop said: \u2018Are you sure?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When Horsley-Summer took out his piercings five years later, he realised what the piercer had meant: he had two bald spots in the centre of his eyebrows.It took nearly a decade for the hair to grow back. His advice to anyone thinking of getting an eyebrow piercing? \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Get a tattoo where no one can see it.\u201d</p> <p>If a calamity should befall your eyebrows, don\u2019t do as 27-year-old Kimberley Hall did, and heap disaster upon disaster. Hall, a police service adviser from Edinburgh, bought a precision hair trimmer with the intention of tidying up her eyebrows, but a combination of a hangover and a momentary lapse in concentration proved ruinous.</p> <p>\u201cI shaved half of my right eyebrow off by accident,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThen I thought, I can\u2019t have half an eyebrow \u2013 so I decided taking it all off was a better decision.\u201d (It was not.) Looking upon her work with despair, Hall made yet another unforced error, and decided to get a fringe cut to cover it up. \u201cIt was a double disaster,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI had to tell people about the eyebrow straight away, because they were judging my terrible hair.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, the decision is out of your hands.

      "bodyText": "It is one of nature\u2019s cruellest jokes: by the time we are old enough to be entrusted with eyebrows, we have often already ruined them. The effects of improper eyebrow maintenance in our teenage years may last a lifetime; a battlefield massacre you see reflected back at you every time you look in the mirror. But even into adulthood, eyebrow-related mishaps may occur. This week, the Sun reported that 37-year-old Colline Rees from Llanelli, south Wales, had a family holiday ruined after a botched eyebrow treatment left her too embarrassed to pose for photos. After a trainee therapist accidentally waxed off most of her right eyebrow, the salon attempted to fix the mistake by painting thick, black dye on Rees\u2019s brows. \u201cAll my close friends and family were saying I look like something out of the Angry Birds,\u201d Rees said. At least Rees was left with eyebrows \u2013 sort of. When Hattie Grylls decided to shape her eyebrows while on a family holiday aged 13, her dad\u2019s rusty old razor was the closest implement to hand. The 26-year-old Londoner, who works in publishing, says: \u201cI still get a rash from embarrassment just thinking about it.\u201d At the time, thin eyebrows were in vogue. \u201cI\u2019d just started shaving my legs and got my period. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m a woman now.\u2019\u201d Plus, Grylls had started a tentative holiday romance with a boy called Alex, and she hoped her new, adult eyebrows would seal the deal. \u201cI was trying to do it methodically,\u201d Grylls says. The trouble is, a razor isn\u2019t that precise. \u201cI\u2019d overdo it on one side, so I\u2019d do a bit more to even it out on the other side.\u201d Reader, she shaved her eyebrows off. After surveying the damage to her face, Grylls borrowed her mum\u2019s eyeliner, drew them back on, and went downstairs for lunch. \u201cDad said: \u2018You\u2019re never using my razor again.\u2019\u201d It wasn\u2019t all bad: even sans eyebrows, Grylls managed to kiss Alex later that week. Not all victims are so lucky. When Ben Horsley-Summer was 20, he was into \u201cshouty\u201d music, and had a face full of piercings and long black hair to boot. Two eyebrow piercings in an unusual place \u2013 the centre of his brows, directly above his pupils \u2013 seemed like a good bet. \u201cIt would be a bit different,\u201d Horsley-Summer, a 34-year-old marketing manager from Guildford, recalls. \u201cGet something no one else has. The guy in the piercing shop said: \u2018Are you sure?\u2019\u201d When Horsley-Summer took out his piercings five years later, he realised what the piercer had meant: he had two bald spots in the centre of his eyebrows.It took nearly a decade for the hair to grow back. His advice to anyone thinking of getting an eyebrow piercing? \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Get a tattoo where no one can see it.\u201d If a calamity should befall your eyebrows, don\u2019t do as 27-year-old Kimberley Hall did, and heap disaster upon disaster. Hall, a police service adviser from Edinburgh, bought a precision hair trimmer with the intention of tidying up her eyebrows, but a combination of a hangover and a momentary lapse in concentration proved ruinous. \u201cI shaved half of my right eyebrow off by accident,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThen I thought, I can\u2019t have half an eyebrow \u2013 so I decided taking it all off was a better decision.\u201d (It was not.) Looking upon her work with despair, Hall made yet another unforced error, and decided to get a fringe cut to cover it up. \u201cIt was a double disaster,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI had to tell people about the eyebrow straight away, because they were judging my terrible hair.\u201d Sometimes, the decision is out of your hands. Two years ago, Humzah, 20, a student at Exeter University, fell asleep at a house party. He woke up to find his eyebrows had been partly shaved off. \u201cI had to wear makeup for about a month afterwards, which would usually melt off halfway through the day, making me look incredibly strange.\u201d To any teenagers who may be reading this, about to absent-mindedly do some facial landscape gardening using your mum\u2019s Venus: put the razor down. Unless it\u2019s already too late \u2013 in which case, don\u2019t worry. They\u2019ll grow back. Eventually. Probably.",

They know a thing or two about diplomacy\u201d \u2013 Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cRegarding winning a letter of the day prize (Fiver passim): My husband David won a copy of Football Manager at least two years ago (if not more \u2013 the memory is too painful as I\u2019ve never won letter of the day despite being well ahead in the number of Fiver letters published competition between us). He did receive it and, as neither of us was interested in playing it, I offered it to my students as a charity raffle prize. It was refused\u201d \u2013 Katie Maddock. \u201cJust to cheer up those letter o\u2019the day winners who never got their prize, I thought I\u2019d let you know that I did get my book but I haven\u2019t bothered reading it yet\u201d \u2013 Matt Emerson. \u201cRe: \u505a\u4e00\u4e2a. So it seems \u2018do one\u2019 and \u2018make one\u2019 are the same in Chinese\u201d \u2013 Jon Gordon (and 1,056 others). \u201cIn reply to Trevor Towson. Seems you\u2019re right in regards to \u2018railway stop offs\u2019. In my own city, Liverpool, it\u2019s Edge Hill (rather famous in railway history). But I have to take my hat off to the scaffolding company Climax, which backs on to the railway at Broadgreen. Their slogan is: \u2018Why get off at Edge Hill. When you can climax in Broadgreen\u2019\u201d \u2013 Stephen Sullivan. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Hubert O\u2019Hearn. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Paulo Dybala will get his chat on with Maurizio Sarri after he returns to Juventus training before deciding whether to wedge himself into Manchester United\u2019s bloated squad. England\u2019s Phil Neville and USA! USA!! USA!!! head coach Jill Ellis have been nominated for best women\u2019s coach at the Best Fifa Football gongs. A winding-up petition issued against Bury over tax-knack has been dismissed by the high court. Meanwhile, Nigel Clough reckons the Premier League should help them out. \u201cI genuinely think there is enough money in football at the moment to support everybody,\u201d said Clough. \u201cI know the Premier League have so much control because they control the purse strings, but also there is a responsibility to the rest of football.\u201d Football authorities from around the world have called on Saudi Arabia to stop allowing live matches to be screened illegally. \u201cWe request that the Saudi Ministry of Culture and the Saudi government take swift and decisive action against BeoutQ,\u201d read a letter that is sure to put the frighteners on them. And Sheffield United have agreed a club-record \u00a320m deal to sign Oli McBurnie, who regularly popped out from behind his beard to score loads of goals for Swansea last season. STILL WANT MORE? Our Premier League previews continue apace with No 5: Burnley and No 6: Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea. Two more sleeps till the Championship kicks off. Ben Fisher shifts into preview mode. And here are 10 of the best Championship signings. Asked and answered by the Knowledge boffins: which goalkeepers scored on their debuts? Gavin Willacy uses his inside knowledge to look at how Charlton\u2019s academy keeps producing whizzy tyros who go far. Take Him to Asia, leave Him on bench. What was the point, asks John Duerden. The Football League has bared its teeth to Bury, but \u2013 hey \u2013 we can all do better, writes proper journalist David Conn.

      "bodyText": "Self-flagellation comes a little easier when standing in the winner\u2019s enclosure after one of the season\u2019s most valuable events. \u201cPanicked\u201d, \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201ca mess\u201d were three of the ways John Gosden described the first half of Too Darn Hot\u2019s season here on Wednesday but that is now a distant memory thanks to a half-length win in the Sussex Stakes, a third Group One victory in five days for Gosden and his jockey, Frankie Dettori. Too Darn Hot carried all before him in an unbeaten four-race career at two, earning the highest end-of-season rating for a juvenile since the incomparable Frankel. But his second season opened with a run of four straight defeats \u2013 honourable, for the most part, but defeats all the same. A recent Group One win in France steadied the ship but this victory was the one that really mattered and confirmation duly followed that Too Darn Hot will retire to Dalham Hall Stud at the end of the season. There were two or three strides in the course of the race when a hard-luck story suddenly seemed possible. Too Darn Hot was in a slight pocket and Circus Maximus, who beat him in the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot, had already struck for home. Dettori, though, is riding like a man who can see 10 seconds into the future and, having waited a couple of seconds for some running room away from the rail, he launched Too Darn Hot after his old rival and chased him down with something to spare. Dettori has won three consecutive Group Ones in Britain for the second time this summer and has a live chance to make it four in a row when he rides Mehdiyaah, the second-favourite, in the Nassau Stakes here on Thursday.

Her comments did not go down well with Jeremy Corbyn and his closest advisers, who don\u2019t want Labour to be defined principally as a remain party, and it was widely assumed that this led to Thornberry being \u2018punished\u2019 when she was not allowed to stand in for Corbyn at the next PMQs when he was absent.</p> <p>But this does not seem to have discouraged Thornberry. <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/news/105676/emily-thornberry-warns-jeremy-corbyn-labour-would\">According to PoliticsHome</a>, in an interview in Australia Thornberry said Labour would be \u201coff our bloody rockers\u201d not to campaign for remain in all circumstances in any future referendum.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s official position on this has evolved. Earlier this year Corbyn firmly committed the party to backing a referendum on no deal, or a Tory Brexit deal, and then he went further, saying that if a future Labour government were to negotiate a Brexit deal, that would be put to a referendum too. He says, in a referendum on no deal or a Tory deal, Labour would back remain. But Corbyn has left open the option of Labour backing leave in a referendum on a deal negotiated by a Labour government, or at least staying neutral.</p> <p>Thornberry says, even if Labour negotiated its own Brexit deal, it should campaign for remain. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that any deal, or no deal, or whatever this government comes up with, should be put back to the British people so they can be asked: is this what you voted for? Because if you did, that\u2019s fine.</p> <p>But we don\u2019t think it is what you voted for. And I\u2019m firmly of the view that Labour\u2019s policy should be that whatever deal a government comes up with \u2013 no ifs, no buts, as Boris Johnson says \u2013 we should put it back to the people, we should have another referendum, and that Labour should campaign to remain.</p> <p>When I\u2019ve been talking to people here in Australia ... what\u2019s really come home to me is that one of the reasons for the increased success of the Australian economy ... is that you increased your trade with your closest neighbours, and yet in Britain what we\u2019re doing is walking away from our closest neighbours and our biggest trading allies.</p> <p>And people that I\u2019ve spoken to here appreciate that, and I have to say practically all of them ... have said if we get an opportunity to remain in the European Union, we should take it.

If that was his thinking before his meeting with the Sinn Fein delegation this morning, it didn\u2019t work because <strong>Mary Lou McDonald,</strong> the Sinn Fein president, was fairly scathing when she spoke at her press briefing afterwards. Sinn Fein leaders never come away from meetings with British prime ministers exuding joy and goodwill (and mostly DUP leaders don\u2019t either), but even by Sinn Fein standards, this was quite withering. Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>McDonald accused Johnson of being \u201ccomplacent\u201d about the damage Brexit would cause the whole of Ireland. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no doubt that Boris Johnson\u2019s first priority coming to Ireland is his interest, Tory interest, British interests, as he sees them, and it seems to me that he is quite complacent at the idea of Ireland being the collateral damage. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that nobody believed Johnson\u2019s claim (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/31/boris-johnson-holds-talks-in-belfast-as-sinn-fein-says-border-poll-must-follow-no-deal-brexit-live-news?page=with:block-5d4143218f0845f89e3179e9#block-5d4143218f0845f89e3179e9\">9.29am)</a> to be impartial between the DUP and Sinn Fein.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He tells us that he will act with absolute impartiality.

Nobody believes that because there are no grounds to believe that there is any kind of impartiality, much less strict impartiality.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the Tory/DUP confidence and supply agreement had \u201cpoisoned the groundwater\u201d in Northern Ireland politically. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have told him that the confidence and supply agreement between the Tories and the DUP poisoned the groundwater here politically and made it very, very, very difficult to sustain a negotiation, much less to land on a conclusion or an agreement.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said Johnson had to stop acting like the DUP\u2019s gofer. </strong>She said Johnson asked the Sinn Fein team for their advice. She went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have strongly advised that to make progress here he needs to ensure that he is not the DUP\u2019s gofer. He needs to stop mollycoddling them. He needs to spell out the realities of life to them.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She criticised what he has said about how Northern Ireland addresses legacy issues (ie, killings during the Troubles).</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have advised him that his commentary thus far on these issues as British prime minister has been damaging and very, very dangerous.</p> </blockquote> <p>That seemed to be a reference to Johnson telling Tory MPs, in his first address to the 1922 Committee as party leader, that<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-promises-to-protect-troubles-soldiers-from-persecution-8hxgp3f5c\"> the persecution of military veterans facing historical allegations over their conduct in Northern Ireland has \u201cgot to stop\u201d.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>She said her team told Johnson that it would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d to refuse to allow Northern Ireland a border poll in the event of a no deal Brexit.</strong> See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/31/boris-johnson-holds-talks-in-belfast-as-sinn-fein-says-border-poll-must-follow-no-deal-brexit-live-news?page=with:block-5d4143218f0845f89e3179e9#block-5d4143218f0845f89e3179e9\"> 9.29am </a>for more on McDonald\u2019s thinking on this. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said the DUP were denying the people of Northern Ireland their rights</strong>.

But the government is also supposed to be neutral as it mediates between DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in on restoring power-sharing. Asked how impartial he would be in the light of the dinner with the DUP last night, Johnson said as he arrived at Stormont this morning:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s all there in the Good Friday agreement. We believe in complete impartiality and that\u2019s what we are going to observe.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said he would be focusing on getting the executive functioning again.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Clearly the people in Northern Ireland have been without a government, without Stormont, for two years and six months so my prime focus this morning is to do everything I can to help that get up and running again because I think that\u2019s profoundly in the interests of people here, of all the citizens here in Northern Ireland.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he attached \u201chuge importance to the letter, spirit of the Belfast/ Good Friday agreement and will be insisting on that\u201d. </strong>He was speaking in the context of Brexit, and addressing claims that a no-deal Brexit would undermine the Good Friday agreement.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn F\u00e9in president, said that Brexit changes the terms of debate in Northern Ireland, boosting the case for Irish reunification. </strong>Speaking on the Today programme, she said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Traditionally the argument and the discourse [in Northern Ireland] has been between green and orange, between Irishness and Britishness. But Brexit changed that and added a new dimension, a critical dimension, which is European or not? Inside the European Union or not? And for the purposes of the north of Ireland, a very direct choice, economically, socially, politically, as to whether or not this part of the island wishes to become a sort of backwater, marooned somewhere between the Tories in Number 10 and the very, very destructive agenda of the DUP.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said there were now unionists willing to consider the case for reunification following Brexit. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For everybody across society, Brexit has raised fundamental questions around the wisdom and the sustainability of the partition of our island which we have lived with now since the 1920s ... It\u2019s changed the entire political dynamic, it has changed the parameters of the conversation. In the course of the debate that we will have about constitutional change, lots of people for whom a united Ireland would still not be their first preference, who would still have a strong attachment to union, even they now are willing and eager to have the conversation [about Irish reunification].</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said it would be \u201cscandalous\u201d to refuse Northern Ireland a referendum on joining a united Ireland after a no deal Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the event of a hard Brexit and a crash Brexit, I don\u2019t know for the life of me how anybody could sustain an argument that things remain the same ... </p> <p>I don\u2019t know how Britain could crash this part of Ireland out of the EU with all of the attendant harm and damage economically and politically and, with a straight face, suggest to any of us who live on this island that we should not be given the democratic opportunity as per the Good Friday agreement to decide our future. I think that would be quite scandalous.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she thought there were already grounds for holding a referendum in the north. </strong>Under the terms of the Good Friday agreement, the UK government is obliged to hold a referendum, or \u201cborder poll\u201d, if at any time it seems \u201clikely\u201d that a majority in the north would vote to form part of a united Ireland. McDonald said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a matter that I had explored at great length since I became the leader of Sinn Fein with Theresa May and with Karen Bradley [the former Northern Ireland secretary]. And I raised this matter with Julian Smith [the new Northern Ireland secretary] when I met him the other day.

I mean, this northern state is built on the assumption of a perpetual unionist majority. That political majority has been lost in three successive elections ...

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has wrapped up a morning of talks with the five main parties in Northern Ireland having heard multiple warnings from them about how damaging a no deal Brexit would be (see 11.06am, 11.16am, and 12.10pm). It was his first visit to Northern Ireland as prime minister, and his first proper engagement with the parties, but there was no sign that he had made any progress towards getting Sinn Fein and the DUP to agree to the resumption of power-sharing. It would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d if a no-deal Brexit was not followed by a poll on Irish reunification, the leader of Sinn F\u00e9in has warned Boris Johnson, also telling the prime minister that no one believed he was impartial on Northern Ireland. Any future US-UK trade deal would almost certainly be blocked by the US Congress if Brexit affects the Irish border and jeopardises peace in Northern Ireland, congressional leaders and diplomats have warned. Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry has said the party would be \u201coff our bloody rockers\u201d not to seize the chance to remain in the EU via a second referendum, in an interview which put her at odds with comments from Jeremy Corbyn over the weekend. Investment in Britain\u2019s car industry has effectively stopped amid fears over Brexit, with a \u201cpitiful\u201d \u00a390m pledged for new developments in the first six months of this year, according to the industry body. Campaigners have called for the government to scrap the \u201cnasty\u201d two-child limit on benefits after the latest official figures showed that nearly 600,000 children were affected by the controversial policy. Boris Johnson has sent his most senior EU adviser and Brexit negotiator to Brussels to deliver in person his message that the UK will leave without a deal unless the bloc abolishes the Irish backstop. As Daniel Boffey reports, David Frost, a former British ambassador to Denmark who was also an adviser to Johnson when he was foreign secretary, is to hold talks with EU officials over the next 48 hours. Labour has written to the elections watchdog urging pre-emptive action to ensure a US-based pro-Brexit lobbying group, co-run by Nigel Farage, does not risk \u201cdark money\u201d from overseas subverting the UK electoral system. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The YouGov poll (see 3.47pm) was commissioned by the Times. In the write-up in the paper (paywall), Matt Chorley points out that it reveals a striking gender gap in voting intention. A breakdown of the results shows support for the Tories among men has risen from 23 per cent to 35 per cent since [Boris] Johnson was named leader. Among women it rose by one point to 29 per cent. At the same time support for Labour among women has risen from 19 per cent to 25 per cent. Another way of putting it would be to say that, amongst men, the Tories have a 16-point lead over Labour (35% v 19%). Amongst women the Tory lead is just four points (29% v 25%). You can read all the detailed figures here (pdf). YouGov has some polling out today that is encouraging for Boris Johnson. As the YouGov write-up says, the figures are also grim for Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson is still the public\u2019s preferred prime minister over Jeremy Corbyn, with twice as many people choosing the former (42%) over the latter (21%). A further 34% of people can\u2019t choose between the two. Here is Matthew Goodwin, an academic specialism in the study of populism, commenting on the poll. After Boris Johnson left Stormont the new Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, called the parties together for a meeting. Afterwards he said: Following my initial meetings with the political parties this week and last, I met with the leaders of the five main parties this afternoon to move the talks process forward. I have asked the five independent working group leads to hold further meetings and report back early next week. I will discuss further steps with the Irish government once I have received their reports. It is my priority to restore devolution as soon as possible. This is from the Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald on Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Belfast. In the comments someone asked if Boris Johnson visited the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency when he was in Wales yesterday. There had been no media, so I posted a reply saying he hadn\u2019t. But I was wrong; he did visit. This is from Iain McIntosh, a local Tory councillor. As Sky\u2019s Emily Ashton points out, it is unusual for a politician to do a visit like that and not to include a walkabout. In their comments after their meeting with Boris Johnson, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, and her deputy, Nigel Dodds, both criticised the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar. Foster said described comments Varadkar made last week suggesting a no deal Brexit could increase the chance of Ireland being reunited as \u201cproject fear mark two from the taoiseach\u201d. And Dodds criticised him for talking up the prospect of a border poll. He said: Leo Varadkar is in breach of the Belfast agreement by talking that up. The reality is that the conditions are not met and those who create this hysteria about it are actually running contrary to the agreement. Let\u2019s get real here, the idea that many unionists will turn around and vote for a united Ireland on the basis of the current developments, I think, is something that is not reflected in the reality of people on the ground. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, and her deputy Nigel Dodds, both spoke to the media after their discussions with Boris Johnson. Here are the main points they made. Foster said Johnson had told them he would be never be neutral on the issue of the union. But the UK government would be neutral on the administration of government within Northern Ireland, she said. She said people should not confuse the two issues, which were different. She said Johnson had told them he was not minded to have a border poll in Northern Ireland, as Sinn Fein is demanding. (See 9.29am.) She said: Talk of a border poll, he told us, was not something that he was entertaining. Dodds said Johnson had told them he was \u201cvery, very committed\u201d to carrying forward the confidence and supply agreement between the DUP and the Tories. Foster and Dodds both strongly defended the agreement. Dodds said Sinn Fein were wrong to claim it had \u201cpoisoned the groundwater\u201d in Northern Ireland politically. (See 11.06am.) And Foster said it had benefited everyone in Northern Ireland. She explained: The confidence and supply agreement has been good for the people of Northern Ireland. You would think, to hear some people, it\u2019s a bad thing that has been visited on the people of Northern Ireland. We have delivered an extra \u00a31bn for the people of Northern Ireland which they would not otherwise have if it were not for the relationship between ourselves and the current government. Dodds rejected claims that a no deal Brexit would create an insuperable problem at the Irish border. He explained: There is a border, of course there\u2019s a border. We are not the united Ireland. We have a political border, we have a fiscal border, we have a currency border, we have a VAT border, we have a security border. So clearly there will be borders. But the issue is, how do we manage checks and controls so that there is no hard border. The Irish government have already made the point that that can be done away from the border even in the event of a no deal. Foster urged the Irish government to \u201cdial down the rhetoric\u201d and engage with Johnson. She said: There are ways to with this issue [the backstop] if there is a willingness on both sides. And so I hope that Dublin will dial down the rhetoric and there will be a willingness to engage with our new prime minister. Foster said it would be a mistake for Johnson to rule out going for a no deal Brexit if he cannot get a better deal from Brussels. She explained: I sometimes wonder have people ever been in negotiations when they take things off the table before you get to the end of a negotiation. Of course you keep it on the table. Dodds rejected suggestions that it was inappropriate for Johnson to have a private dinner with DUP leaders last night. He said the DUP talk to the government at Westminster all the time. Boris Johnson has now finished his talks with the five main Northern Ireland parties, and he has left Stormont. From what the parties have been saying, there is no sign that he has made any progress towards reviving the power-sharing executive. Downing Street has released this statement about his talks. The prime minister met five of Northern Ireland\u2019s main political parties today in Belfast. The overarching purpose of these meetings was to discuss moving forward in the ongoing power sharing talks and getting the Northern Irish democratic institutions back up and running as soon as possible. The prime minister told all of the parties that he was determined to bring this process to a successful conclusion and that he would do everything he could to make it happen. He said that while there had been constructive progress in recent weeks at Stormont, that there now needed to be serious and intense engagement to get this done and that he had faith that all parties would step up to the challenge. The discussions also included Brexit, where the prime minister made clear that the UK would be leaving the EU on October come what may, and restated his intention to do so with a deal. He said that in all scenarios, the government is steadfast in its commitment to the Belfast/Good Friday agreement and that in no circumstances would there be physical checks or infrastructure on the border. He also made clear his belief and commitment in the rigorous impartiality set out in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, while at the same time reaffirming his determination to strengthen the Union and Northern Ireland\u2019s place within it. They also discussed what the UK government could do to support Harland &amp; Wolff and Wrightbus. Alongside the new secretary of state, Julian Smith, he said he was looking forward to engaging widely and seeing more of this fantastic part of our United Kingdom. Jeremy Corbyn has urged Boris Johnson to nationalise the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Northern Ireland to stop it closing. When George Osborne was chancellor, as part of his austerity programme, which concentrated heavily on welfare cuts, he introduced a \u2018two-child rule\u201d which meant people could not claim child tax credits or the child element of universal credit for more than two children from April 2017. It was sometimes referred to as the \u201crape clause\u201d because among the exceptions allowed were mothers who could prove their third child was conceived as a result of rape. Today HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions have published a document (pdf) showing how many people have been affected. It says that since 2017 almost 160,000 households have lost money as a result. More than 60,000 of those are single-parent households, as this graph shows. The total number of children in these households is almost 600,000. The figures also show that 510 women have been granted an exception due to the \u201crape clause\u201d, or \u201cnon-consensual conception\u201d, as the report puts it. Child tax credits or the child element of universal credit can be worth \u00a32,780 to families with two children. Commenting on today\u2019s figures, Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: Every child deserves a good start in life, but today\u2019s figures are a grim reminder of the human cost of this nasty policy, which says that some children are more deserving than others purely on the basis of their birth order - and which mostly affects working families. In the UK we would never turn a third-born child away from school or hospital. How can it be right to deny the same young children the support they need to enjoy a childhood free from poverty when their family falls on hard times? Back at Stormont Nichola Mallon, the deputy leader of the SDLP, said Boris Johnson does not understand the issues facing Northern Ireland after her team met the prime minister. This is from the BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack. This is from UTV\u2019s Tracey Magee. And this is what Mallon said on Twitter earlier, before her meeting. After Labour was beaten by the Lib Dems in the European elections Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said the party should have been been more explicitly pro-remain. Her comments did not go down well with Jeremy Corbyn and his closest advisers, who don\u2019t want Labour to be defined principally as a remain party, and it was widely assumed that this led to Thornberry being \u2018punished\u2019 when she was not allowed to stand in for Corbyn at the next PMQs when he was absent. But this does not seem to have discouraged Thornberry. According to PoliticsHome, in an interview in Australia Thornberry said Labour would be \u201coff our bloody rockers\u201d not to campaign for remain in all circumstances in any future referendum. Labour\u2019s official position on this has evolved. Earlier this year Corbyn firmly committed the party to backing a referendum on no deal, or a Tory Brexit deal, and then he went further, saying that if a future Labour government were to negotiate a Brexit deal, that would be put to a referendum too. He says, in a referendum on no deal or a Tory deal, Labour would back remain. But Corbyn has left open the option of Labour backing leave in a referendum on a deal negotiated by a Labour government, or at least staying neutral. Thornberry says, even if Labour negotiated its own Brexit deal, it should campaign for remain. She said: I think that any deal, or no deal, or whatever this government comes up with, should be put back to the British people so they can be asked: is this what you voted for? Because if you did, that\u2019s fine. But we don\u2019t think it is what you voted for. And I\u2019m firmly of the view that Labour\u2019s policy should be that whatever deal a government comes up with \u2013 no ifs, no buts, as Boris Johnson says \u2013 we should put it back to the people, we should have another referendum, and that Labour should campaign to remain. When I\u2019ve been talking to people here in Australia ... what\u2019s really come home to me is that one of the reasons for the increased success of the Australian economy ... is that you increased your trade with your closest neighbours, and yet in Britain what we\u2019re doing is walking away from our closest neighbours and our biggest trading allies. And people that I\u2019ve spoken to here appreciate that, and I have to say practically all of them ... have said if we get an opportunity to remain in the European Union, we should take it. Because if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re off our bloody rockers. Naomi Long, the Alliance party leader and MEP, does not seem to have been impressed by Boris Johnson when they met, according to the BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack. In a statement released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which is calling for a second referendum on Brexit, Peter Hain, the former Labour Northern Ireland secretary, says Boris Johnson should be speaking to people living by the border with Ireland on his visit to find out what Brexit will mean. Hain says: Boris Johnson is using Northern Ireland for stake money in his gamble with the future of the UK. He is willing to see security and progress threatened, damaged or even destroyed if it helps him in his drive to push the UK out of the EU without the people being given the final say. Maybe Mr Johnson should spend more time talking to ordinary people in the towns and villages by the border, where the local economies face devastation if no deal is forced on them. After twenty-one years of progress since the Belfast agreement it is disgraceful that Boris Johnson has so little grip on the realities of Northern Ireland\u2019s finely balanced politics that he believes a simple promise not to put infrastructure on the frontier line itself solves all problems. Enforcing new customs checks, wherever they come, will mean massively increasing state intrusion into the lives and businesses of those who regularly cross the border and that poses a real threat to the economy - and ultimately to security. Boris Johnson cannot have his no deal or hard Brexit and keep the border open and invisible. All of this is a million miles away from anything discussed in the referendum campaign and that is why it is essential we have a people\u2019s vote. The Ulster Unionist party told Boris Johnson that it did not want a no deal Brexit, the BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack reports. There are various protests going on at Stormont to mark Boris Johnson\u2019s visit. This picture shows anti-Brexit protesters and pro-rights campaigners who are standing together under the statue of Edward Carson. And these are Harland and Wolff employees, who are campaigning to save their shipyard. Boris Johnson sometimes seem to think that he can win people over with a bit of personal charm. If that was his thinking before his meeting with the Sinn Fein delegation this morning, it didn\u2019t work because Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn Fein president, was fairly scathing when she spoke at her press briefing afterwards. Sinn Fein leaders never come away from meetings with British prime ministers exuding joy and goodwill (and mostly DUP leaders don\u2019t either), but even by Sinn Fein standards, this was quite withering. Here are the main points. McDonald accused Johnson of being \u201ccomplacent\u201d about the damage Brexit would cause the whole of Ireland. She said: There is no doubt that Boris Johnson\u2019s first priority coming to Ireland is his interest, Tory interest, British interests, as he sees them, and it seems to me that he is quite complacent at the idea of Ireland being the collateral damage. She said that nobody believed Johnson\u2019s claim (see 9.29am) to be impartial between the DUP and Sinn Fein. She said: He tells us that he will act with absolute impartiality. We\u2019ve told him that nobody believes that. Nobody believes that because there are no grounds to believe that there is any kind of impartiality, much less strict impartiality. She said the Tory/DUP confidence and supply agreement had \u201cpoisoned the groundwater\u201d in Northern Ireland politically. She said: We have told him that the confidence and supply agreement between the Tories and the DUP poisoned the groundwater here politically and made it very, very, very difficult to sustain a negotiation, much less to land on a conclusion or an agreement. She said Johnson had to stop acting like the DUP\u2019s gofer. She said Johnson asked the Sinn Fein team for their advice. She went on: We have strongly advised that to make progress here he needs to ensure that he is not the DUP\u2019s gofer. He needs to stop mollycoddling them. He needs to spell out the realities of life to them. She criticised what he has said about how Northern Ireland addresses legacy issues (ie, killings during the Troubles). She said: We have advised him that his commentary thus far on these issues as British prime minister has been damaging and very, very dangerous. That seemed to be a reference to Johnson telling Tory MPs, in his first address to the 1922 Committee as party leader, that the persecution of military veterans facing historical allegations over their conduct in Northern Ireland has \u201cgot to stop\u201d. She said her team told Johnson that it would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d to refuse to allow Northern Ireland a border poll in the event of a no deal Brexit. See 9.29am for more on McDonald\u2019s thinking on this. She said the DUP were denying the people of Northern Ireland their rights. She said: The DUP have used every contrivance to frustrate social and political progress here and to ensure the continuing denial of rights. They have used this as a ruse to really trample on the views of the majority of people who live here, whether it\u2019s in relation to rights issues or in relation to Brexit. This was a particular reference to the DUP\u2019s opposition to marriage equality for Northern Ireland and to legislation to benefit Irish language speakers. She said any move to direct rule in Northern Ireland - something the government has not ruled out in the event of a no deal Brexit - would be unacceptable and very dangerous in turning the clock back. At Stormont Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn Fein president, is speaking to the media following the Sinn Fein delegations meeting with Boris Johnson. She says they stressed their opposition to a no deal Brexit, and their view that no deal would justify another border poll. She says Sinn Fein accused the DUP of holding up the restoration of power-sharing. She says Johnson assured them he would be impartial in dealings between the DUP and Sinn Fein. She says they told him that no one believed that. McDonald says her team told Johnson no one believes his claim to be impartial between the DUP and Sinn Fein. She is now taking questions. In response to a question about the DUP, she says there is an axis between the DUP and the Tories. She says the Tories will do anything and everything to remain in government. In coming to Ireland, he is only interested in his interests and Britain\u2019s interests. He says Johnson is \u201ccomplacent\u201d about Ireland suffering collateral damage from a no deal Brexit. Sinn Fein accuses Johnson of being \u201ccomplacent\u201d about risks to Ireland from a no deal Brexit. In her Today programme interview this morning Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn Fein\u2019s president, said she has been asking the UK government to explain what needs to happen for another referendum to take place in Northern Ireland on joining a united Ireland. (See 9.29am.) The last one was in 1973. This Institute for Government briefing sets out some possible criteria that might apply. As part of the Good Friday Agreement, an explicit provision for holding a Northern Ireland border poll was made in UK law. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 states that \u201cif at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland\u201d, the secretary of state shall make an order in council enabling a border poll. It is not clear exactly what would satisfy this requirement. The Constitution Unit suggests that a consistent majority in opinion polls, a Catholic majority in a census, a nationalist majority in the Northern Ireland assembly, or a vote by a majority in the assembly could all be considered evidence of majority support for a united Ireland. However, the secretary of state must ultimately decide whether the condition has been met. The IfG note also includes this chart on polling that undermines McDonald\u2019s claim that support for Irish reunification in the north is rising. The Scottish Conservatives have said they will not \u201cdeal with hypotheticals\u201d after the SNP challenged Ruth Davidson to give \u201ca cast-iron guarantee\u201d that her MPs will vote to block a no-deal Brexit. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Davidson, pointing to suggestions that her opposition to a no deal Brexit is \u201clittle more than meaningless empty rhetoric ...a cynical PR exercise designed to distance you from Boris Johnson, in the knowledge that the Tory party is tanking in the polls in Scotland and came fourth place in the European elections on just 11%\u201d. The letter comes after Boris Johnson visited Scotland on Monday, meeting both first minister Nicola Sturgeon and Davidson, who warned the prime minister on the eve of his visit that she could not support a no deal Brexit. The read-out from their meeting was resolutely reassured, saying that she backed his Brexit strategy \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d. The meeting was, the Guardian understands, overwhelming positive, and covered a lot of ground in terms of how Westminster can best serve Scotland. Responding to Blackford\u2019s letter, a Scottish Conservatives spokesman said: We\u2019re not going to jump ahead 15 stages or deal with hypotheticals \u2013 everyone\u2019s focus is getting a deal done with the EU that can get through parliament. But the fact remains that Davidson has quite a circle to square. Should Johnson call a general election on a platform of no deal, how will she stand, given her own stated opposition and the knowledge that \u2013 as Blackford points out \u2013 her party in Scotland has lost significant numbers of votes to the Brexit party? Will she call on her own MPs to vote against the prime minister? And how does she sell Johnson and his so-called \u2018war cabinet\u2019 to those centre right voters who signed up to her re-framing on the Scottish Tories? The economic shock of a disorderly Brexit in Ireland would shrink employment by 34,000 jobs by the end of next year, the country\u2019s central bank has said. In its quarterly bulletin (pdf) it says GDP growth for 2019 would be reduced from 4.9% to 4.5% if there was a crash out on 31 October, but the country would suffer a massive hit 2020 with growth falling from 4.1 to 0.7 per cent. Household and business spending would fall while exports would fall \u201cdue to an immediate and large reduction in demand from the UK and the fall in sterling\u201d. \u201cAs a result, by the end of 2020 our estimates suggest that there would be around 34,000 fewer jobs in the economy compared to the level of employment that could be realised in a no-Brexit scenario,\u201d it says. However it warns that \u201cthere is an unavoidably high degree of uncertainty\u201d about the modelling of its forecasts because Brexit is without precedent. Boris Johnson is in Northern Ireland this morning where he has just started what will be a series of talks with the five main parties. The last time he was here, for a hustings during the Tory leadership contest, he sounded as if he knew almost nothing about the reasons for the suspension of the power-sharing executive. He should be better informed by lunchtime. We\u2019ll find out, because he is expected to address the media later. Johnson himself and others have also been speaking to the media ahead of the talks, at Stormont and on the usual morning programmes. Here are some of the points they have been making. Johnson claimed that the UK government will be bound by \u201ccomplete impartiality\u201d as it oversees talks designed to get the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland up and running again. The DUP is propping up the Conservative government at Westminster through the confidence and supply arrangement, and last night Johnson had a private dinner with DUP leaders. But the government is also supposed to be neutral as it mediates between DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in on restoring power-sharing. Asked how impartial he would be in the light of the dinner with the DUP last night, Johnson said as he arrived at Stormont this morning: It\u2019s all there in the Good Friday agreement. We believe in complete impartiality and that\u2019s what we are going to observe. He also said he would be focusing on getting the executive functioning again. Clearly the people in Northern Ireland have been without a government, without Stormont, for two years and six months so my prime focus this morning is to do everything I can to help that get up and running again because I think that\u2019s profoundly in the interests of people here, of all the citizens here in Northern Ireland. He said he attached \u201chuge importance to the letter, spirit of the Belfast/ Good Friday agreement and will be insisting on that\u201d. He was speaking in the context of Brexit, and addressing claims that a no-deal Brexit would undermine the Good Friday agreement. Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn F\u00e9in president, said that Brexit changes the terms of debate in Northern Ireland, boosting the case for Irish reunification. Speaking on the Today programme, she said: Traditionally the argument and the discourse [in Northern Ireland] has been between green and orange, between Irishness and Britishness. But Brexit changed that and added a new dimension, a critical dimension, which is European or not? Inside the European Union or not? And for the purposes of the north of Ireland, a very direct choice, economically, socially, politically, as to whether or not this part of the island wishes to become a sort of backwater, marooned somewhere between the Tories in Number 10 and the very, very destructive agenda of the DUP. She said there were now unionists willing to consider the case for reunification following Brexit. She said: For everybody across society, Brexit has raised fundamental questions around the wisdom and the sustainability of the partition of our island which we have lived with now since the 1920s ... It\u2019s changed the entire political dynamic, it has changed the parameters of the conversation. In the course of the debate that we will have about constitutional change, lots of people for whom a united Ireland would still not be their first preference, who would still have a strong attachment to union, even they now are willing and eager to have the conversation [about Irish reunification]. She said it would be \u201cscandalous\u201d to refuse Northern Ireland a referendum on joining a united Ireland after a no deal Brexit. In the event of a hard Brexit and a crash Brexit, I don\u2019t know for the life of me how anybody could sustain an argument that things remain the same ... I don\u2019t know how Britain could crash this part of Ireland out of the EU with all of the attendant harm and damage economically and politically and, with a straight face, suggest to any of us who live on this island that we should not be given the democratic opportunity as per the Good Friday agreement to decide our future. I think that would be quite scandalous. She said she thought there were already grounds for holding a referendum in the north. Under the terms of the Good Friday agreement, the UK government is obliged to hold a referendum, or \u201cborder poll\u201d, if at any time it seems \u201clikely\u201d that a majority in the north would vote to form part of a united Ireland. McDonald said: This is a matter that I had explored at great length since I became the leader of Sinn Fein with Theresa May and with Karen Bradley [the former Northern Ireland secretary]. And I raised this matter with Julian Smith [the new Northern Ireland secretary] when I met him the other day. I think it\u2019s very important that the British system sets out very clearly for all of us what it and they would understand to be the point of threshold, the trigger point at which a border poll or a referendum would be called ... I think some of the thresholds have been met. I mean, this northern state is built on the assumption of a perpetual unionist majority. That political majority has been lost in three successive elections ... The demographic patterns have been well discussed and well aired and they are moving in on direction. That for me is not the most compelling of arguments but it is a reality. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said that her party\u2019s confidence and supply arrangement with the Tories was still in place. On the subject of continuing it, she told Sky News it was not just a matter of money. For example, she said her party particularly welcomed Johnson\u2019s decision to appoint a veterans minister and to set up an office for veterans\u2019 affairs because, she said, Northern Ireland has more people in the armed forces per head of population than anywhere else in the UK. Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP\u2019s chief whip, told the Today programme he thought the risks of a no deal Brexit were now \u201csignificant\u201d. Asked about claims this could lead 40,000 jobs being lost in Northern Ireland, he said that estimate was at the \u201cvery high end of the scale\u201d. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

He added: \u201cWe\u2019d just got back from a walk on the hillside and it started to rain a little, then within minutes it was this astonishing downpour. \u201cYou can see just walking around the village the effect that it has had. People\u2019s gardens are covered in silt and mud, their lawns don\u2019t exist any more. The farmers \u2013 the hay that they\u2019ve just taken and baled up has been strewn everywhere, so that will be written off. I guess livestock has been lost, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s turned this part of Reeth, the lower part, into a virtual lake, and everyone is working hard to try and recover it.\u201d Commuters faced chaos Wednesday morning as heavy rain flooded the railway between Manchester Piccadilly and Crewe/Stoke-on-Trent, causing both lines to be blocked. Northern Rail said trains had been suspended between Ribblehead and Kirkby Stephen after a landslip between Dent and Ribblehead. Train services between Salford Crescent and Wigan Wallgate have been forced to run at reduced speed, and commuters were told to expect delays and cancellations. In Manchester, an airport road was closed for the third day in a row due to heavy rain. The A555 Manchester airport link road was entirely submerged in deep flood water Wednesday morning despite being pumped clear the day before. In the Yorkshire Dales, a moorland road used in the 2014 Tour de France was impassable due to flood water. Mountain rescue crews were called out on Tuesday to help police and fire services rescue people in cars along Grinton Moor Road between Grinton and Leyburn. The flooding also led to traffic delays across England. Traffic England issued flooding alerts on the A5103 northbound between the M56 and junction with the M60, and warned drivers of congestion caused by flooding on the M56 eastbound between junctions J7 and J3A. The Met Office issued weather warnings for Scotland and parts of central and northern England. Up to 40mm of rain in two hours was predicted in places. The Met Office has warned that as the rainfall continuesthere could further delays and cancellations to train and bus services, and sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and someroad closures. The Environment Agency has issued 12 flood warnings across the UK, from North Yorkshire, Lancashire and the West Midlands. The flooding has affected properties and roads, blocking access to certain areas. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 August 2019. An earlier version referred to the village of Cogden Gill. This should have been the village of Grinton.",

To make sure your last-minute shindig is one to remember, here are a few tips to elevate your soiree without breaking a sweat.</p> <p><strong>Curate the guest list<br></strong>Forget Facebook. In 2019 we WhatsApp. Forming a WhatsApp group for your party creates a space for invitees who don\u2019t know each other to break the ice, and keeps your guest list to only people who know you well enough to have their number, not whoever you feel obliged to add as you scroll through every person you\u2019ve ever met since 2006. If two invitees are exes, invite both, tell them to discuss who (if not both) should attend, and assure them they\u2019ll both be ejected if they start rowing in the kitchen.

If this sentence counts as high praise from anyone, it\u2019s Doherty. The 33-year-old choreographer doesn\u2019t do pretence, either in performance or off stage. When I ask her frequent collaborator the Belfast-born composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/02/david-holmes-it-was-a-modern-day-wrecking-crew\">David Holmes</a> about her, he uses the word \u201craw\u201d three times.</p> <p>That visceral honesty has set her apart in a sea of highly curated contemporary dance brands. Doherty has a rare ability to connect a gesture with the web of emotions that sustain it. In Hard to Be Soft, her hair tucked away in a small bun, she re-creates the muscle memory and social performance of masculinity with complete empathy \u2013 and choreographs it for others, too, including a moving father-son duo.

It\u2019s the middle of the afternoon, and we settle into the tiny, near-empty bar of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Bastille. She is here to perform Hard to Be Soft. It\u2019s the first time one of her creations is on in central Paris rather than in smaller suburban theatres. French venues have been strong supporters of her work from the start, but she admits the local pecking order had escaped her. \u201cIt\u2019s only this time I\u2019ve realised that all my other gigs [have been] at the end of the M\u00e9tro lines!\u201d</p> <p>She is a rarity among artists, a ball of no-nonsense candour and intuition, who seems physically allergic to affectation. A few days earlier, I had watched a visibly tired Doherty, still reeling from the premiere of her latest work, <a href=\"https://www.paris-art.com/oona-doherty-atelier-de-paris-cdcn-lady-magma/\">Lady Magma</a>, deliver one-sentence answers on a panel at the European festival <a href=\"https://aerowaves.org/\">Aerowaves</a>. When asked about her influences, she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t really watch dance.\u201d (Not entirely true, for the record.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/151242266\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/151242266?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>She is rested and more expansive when we sit down, but immediately points out that her gender-bending exploration of masculine tropes in Hard to Be Soft as well as 2016\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.oonadohertyweb.com/hope-hunt\">Hope Hunt</a> came about by accident. The parts she dances in both were created for male friends: she only took over when they got other jobs. \u201cI had never read or looked at anything to do with gender before people started asking me: how did you come to make a gender piece?\u201d</p> <p>Hard to Be Soft also involves a group of powerful teenage girls, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSuEnGGzgIU\">Sugar Army</a>, who are recruited locally in every city and defy \u201cfeminine\u201d expectations (without forgoing lipstick, at least in Paris). Doherty has a dream for her international Sugar Armies: to bring them together for a dance protest in front of Stormont.</p> <p>Holmes calls her \u201ca sponge\u201d. \u201cOona is constantly making it up as she\u2019s going along, listening, absorbing, almost creating on the spot. What she does is really sophisticated, but it\u2019s also completely from the street, so it\u2019s got this real guttural realism to it.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up in Belfast, Doherty was a self-avowed tomboy. Her Northern Irish mother moved the family there from London when she was 10; she and her brother got in trouble for their accents. She started dancing at an after-school club, taking part in her Catholic school\u2019s musicals: \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed to do Cats. I think it was too sexy for the nuns.\u201d</p> <p>Still, religion seeped into her imagination. She once described Hard to Be Soft as a \u201cneon bright prayer\u201d, its design has a church-like feel to it, with light filtering from above. In primary school, Doherty thought she might become a nun herself. When her mother stopped going to mass because it was \u201ctoo depressing\u201d, she went alone to apologise to God for her family\u2019s absence.</p> <p>She over-corrected in some ways as a young adult, getting kicked out of the London Contemporary Dance School after being beset by feelings of inadequacy. \u201cI started acting up, going out with this crazy Sardinian DJ, partying, spending my student loan. That was to do with my ego,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was the best thing that ever happened to me, because then I worked as a waitress, and for the first time in my life, I really missed dancing.\u201d</p> <p>After completing degrees at Ulster University and Laban, Doherty spent four years with T.r.a.s.h, a now defunct Dutch company known for extreme, punk-style experimentation. In 2014, she gravitated back to Northern Ireland. \u201cI was drinking and drugging up too much, I had to go home,\u201d she says frankly. She has no regrets. \u201cWhen I\u2019m working, it helps me to remember what it felt like to be really deep in a ketamine hole, to be like: oh, too much coke. All of that can come back into use in the nervous system to make physical states.\u201d</p> <p>Bangor, the Belfast suburb where her family lives and where Doherty can go on long runs by the sea, has the opposite, grounding effect. She is fiercely protective of her roots. \u201cI\u2019m really serious about myself, and a pain in the ass sometimes. That\u2019s why I like Belfast: it keeps you normal. The artists are amazing, but they don\u2019t let you be an idiot.\u201d </p> <p>At the Atelier de Paris in April, she also unveiled a new work, Lady Magma. This 70s-flavoured, slightly chaotic \u201critual\u201d, another collaboration with Holmes, was born out of an exercise of breathing and release, and reads like a no-holds-barred exploration of female pleasure. \u201cWhen you practise really opening a muscle, and really releasing it, that\u2019s the most simple version of how you can actually let go of shit,\u201d Doherty says, adding that it has led to soul-searching about her own body. \u201cWhen you\u2019re having sex, sometimes it\u2019s hard to truly release into your own pleasure, because you hold a bit of tension. You\u2019re aware, even if you\u2019re trying to not be aware, of what you look like.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time, Doherty isn\u2019t on stage in Lady Magma, although she climbed on a bench in the hall of the theatre before the premiere to lead the audience in breathing exercises. \u201cWhat are you looking for today?\u201d she asked one woman near her. \u201cEmotion,\u201d came the reply, and some of Doherty\u2019s own stress seemed to ebb away as she nodded. She still has her doubts about her ability as a choreographer. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a show yet that has played and done well without me being in it,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just really good at dancing.\u201d</p> <p>The paucity of arts funding in Northern Ireland means there is no guarantee where support will come from for her next projects. Not that Doherty is about to wallow in self-pity. \u201cI\u2019ve had quite an easy life, you know, compared to a lot of people. Geez! I\u2019m a white girl doing contemporary dance!

      "bodyText": "European and US stock markets are mostly trading higher and the pound has rebounded ahead of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s rate decision at 7pm BST. Good-bye \u2013 we\u2019ll be back tomorrow to report on the outcome of the Bank of England\u2019s monthly meeting and its latest growth and inflation forecasts. Dow Jones up 0.2% Nasdaq up 0.2% S&amp;P 500 up 0.02% FTSE 100 down 0.7% Dax up 0.53% CAC 40 up 0.33% FTSE MiB up 0.65% Ibex down 0.18% Traders are buying the pound ahead of the Fed meeting, says Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. He told the Guardian: The market is so short of sterling to be running into a Fed meeting. There is life in cable. We\u2019ve got a little bit of life in what\u2019s been to all intents and purposes a twitching corpse. Looking ahead, he reckons it will take a significant deterioration in the political climate to push the pound below $1.20. If there is a sustained move below that level, however, he believes the pound could quickly fall to $1.10 and perhaps even down to the all-time low of $1.05 plumbed in 1985 during the Thatcher-era sterling crisis. Sterling has risen as much as 0.7% in the last few minutes, to $1.2224. Earlier this week, it fell to a 28-month low of $1.2120. Other analysts attributed the recovery to portfolio readjustments at the end of the month. Lee Hardman, FX strategist at MUFG, told Reuters: We are just seeing stabilisation after four very bad days. [The bounce] doesn\u2019t change the bigger picture and the pound will continue to weaken but clearly it won\u2019t be a one-way street. While the FTSE 100 has hit the day\u2019s low, the German stock market has been boosted by comments from the White House that the trade talks in Shanghai were constructive. The remarks echoed those made by Beijing earlier today. The Dax in Frankfurt has bounced 0.5% on the news. The bounce in sterling has pushed the export-heavy FTSE 100 index down 0.77% to 7587.71, down 58.6 points, because a higher pound is bad news for exporters. Sterling has extended its gains and is now 0.53% higher against the dollar, rising above $1.22, and is up 0.6% against the euro at \u20ac1.0963. Wall Street has opened higher. Dow Jones up 46.64 points, or 0.17%, at 27,244 S&amp;P 500 up 1.92 points, or 0.06%, at 3015 Nasdaq up 14 points, or 0.17%,at 8287 As far as the European Central Bank is concerned, the outgoing president Mario Draghi is locking his successor into a \u201cdangerous round of stimulus,\u201d writes Hans-Werner Sinn, professor emeritus of economics and public finance at the University of Munich. Sinn serves on the German economy ministry\u2019s advisory council. Draghi will be succeeded by Christine Lagarde, the current chief of the International Monetary Fund, on 1 November. With the eurozone data out of the way, markets are now looking ahead to the Fed rate decision later today. A quarter-point (25 basis-point) cut seems likely and there could be further reductions in months to come. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: There\u2019s been a lot of speculation over the past few weeks over whether we\u2019ll get to see the US Federal Reserve cut rates by 25bps or 50bps when they conclude their July meeting later today, when the real discussion ought to be about whether they should be even cutting rates at all... At the end of last year, the real concern was that the Fed was tightening too quickly, in the face of growing storm clouds, however the central bank quickly realised that to do such a thing might well be a mistake. Now it appears that the Fed is about to embark on a rate cut, which too all intents and purposes looks like an attempt to mollify a US President who has his own agenda, and who thinks the central bank is a tool for his own political ends. Quite simply the current data in no way warrants a rate cut, whether it be 25bp or 50bp, with trend growth much higher than when the Fed started its hiking cycle and unemployment which is still near multi year lows. Geoffrey Yu, head of UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management, said about the conclusion of the trade talks: With expectations from this week\u2019s trade talks at rock bottom, the fact that there has been no negative outcome will be viewed as marginally positive for markets. China\u2019s declaration of intent on increasing its agricultural purchases from the US is a clear nod to President Trump\u2019s tweet but does not change the fact that tariffs remain a sideshow to the key rivalry around technology. Markets will be now be primed for further signals from the next round of talks scheduled for September. European stock markets are trading higher, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.27% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.4% after Italian GDP data for the second quarter was better than expected, showing that the economy escaped a contraction. Separate data showed the eurozone grew by 0.2% in the second quarter, half the pace seen in the first quarter, and inflation slowed in July. More encouragingly, the unemployment rate fell to 7.5% in June, the lowest since 2008. There is some relief on the trade war front. Beijing described a new brief round of trade talks with US officials in Shanghai today as \u201cconstructive\u201d. They included a discussion of further purchases of US farm goods and an agreement to reconvene in September. They were the first face-to-face talks since a ceasefire was agreed last month. On currency markets, the dollar is close to two-month highs ahead of the Fed\u2019s rate decision at 7pm BST. Robust US data have made a half-point rate cut less likely, heightening expectations of a quarter-point cut. The dollar index is flat at 98.091. The pound has risen slightly against the dollar and the euro, by 0.16% to $1.21722 and 0.21% to \u20ac1.0919, after hitting a 28-month low this week. Growth in Italy was flat in the second quarter, slightly better than the contraction of 0.1% economists had pencilled in - but pointing to a stagnating economy. The German GDP figures for the second quarter come out in a couple of weeks. Retail sales in June in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy were surprisingly strong, rising by 3.5% from the previous month \u2013 the biggest increase since December 2006. The German jobs market was resilient, separate data showed. The Spanish economy grew by 0.5% in the second quarter, the slowest growth since mid-2014, according to figures out today. This compares with 0.2% in France and in the eurozone as a whole. Nicola Nobile, lead eurozone economist at consultancy Oxford Economics, said: The eurozone data today confirm that the economy has moved down a gear as worsening external conditions and the increase in uncertainty continue to take their toll. While Spain continues to be the eurozone\u2019s strongest performer, its GDP out-turn (+0.5%) for Q2 was still a negative surprise, marking the slowest growth in five years and suggesting that the resilience of the Spanish economy is gradually fading. Looking forward, the continued weakness in eurozone surveys suggest that a robust pick-up in GDP growth in H2 2019 is not on the cards. For the European Central Bank, the question is not whether to stimulate the economy more, but by how much it will do so in September, said Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING. Clearly, the economy is expanding at a slow cruising speed that seems too low for inflation to increase quickly towards the ECB target. And that gives the Bank more ammunition to act in the autumn. While 0.2% is still a decent growth pace, concerns about the economy in the second half of the year are not decreasing, despite monetary stimulus being on its way. Today\u2019s inflation data should confirm the dovish view of a softening inflation outlook as core inflation was weaker than expected at 0.9%. Nadia Gharbi, economist at Pictet Wealth Management, tweeted: This chart from Eurostat shows how economic growth in the eurozone has weakened since last year. Yesterday, French data showed the eurozone\u2019s second-biggest economy grew 0.2% between April and June, down from 0.3% in the first quarter. Until now the French economy has held up better than some of its neighbours including Germany because it is less reliant on exports and less exposed to swings in the global economy. Here is some instant reaction to the eurozone figures. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, tweeted: More encouragingly, the unemployment rate in the eurozone fell to 7.5% in June, from 7.6% in May, according to Eurostat. It is the lowest jobless rate since July 2008. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Czechia (1.9%) and Germany (31.%). The highest unemployment rates were in Greece (17.6% in April) and Spain (14%). Inflation has also slowed in the eurozone, to 1.1% in July compared with 1.3% in June, marking the lowest reading in 17 months. The data will strengthen expectations that the European Central Bank will add further stimulus in September, after its president Mario Draghi said last week that the economic outlook was worsening. The eurozone grew by 0.2% in the second quarter, down from 0.4% in the first quarter, according to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate \u2013 as expected by economists. The annual growth rate fell to 1.1% from 1.2%. This means growth is back to the meagre rates seen at the end of last year. European\u2019s main stock markets are now mostly trading higher, ahead of the eurozone GDP data for the second quarter. Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.25% at 12,177 France\u2019s CAC up 0.09% at 5,516 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.4% at 21,362 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.1% at 8,976 UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 0.3% at 7,621 On the FTSE 250, Aston Martin is the second-biggest faller, while the biggest loser is the shopping centre operator Intu, which owns the Trafford mall in Manchester. Its shares slumped more than 21% to 55.46p. The company\u2019s net rental income fell 7.7% on a like-for-like basis in the six months to June, and its half-year loss widened to \u00a3830m from \u00a3486m. Intu has been hit by a number of retailers going into administration or resorting to company voluntary agreements (CVAs), a type of insolvency procedure, to stay in business. CVAs allow retailers to shut shops and negotiate rent reductions and have been used by household names such as House of Fraser and Debenhams. Others, including Toys R Us and electronics chain Maplin have collapsed into administration, and the last Maplin store closed in June. Among all the gloomy UK corporate news this morning, Next has cheered traders. The clothing chain has bucked the downward trend on the high street and lifted its full-year sales and profit forecasts. The shares are the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 this morning, up 8.4% at \u00a360.89. In Germany, unemployment rose less than expected in July. Official figures showed the number of people out of work rose by 1,000 to 2.28m last month in seasonally adjusted terms, compared with expectations of an increase of 2,000. The unemployment rate stayed at 5%. Daniel Terzenbach, a senior official at the Federal Labour Office, said: Unemployment and underemployment increased in July, mainly due to the beginning of the summer break. The demand from companies for new employees is declining slightly and employment is continuing to increase, albeit less dynamically than recently. However, Carsten Brzeski, chief German economist at ING, noted that in non-seasonally adjusted terms unemployment increased by 59,200 to 2.275m, the highest total since March. He said it was the worst July performance since 2015. The industrial slowdown of the last 12 months is finally leaving its mark on the domestic economy and more particularly on the labour market. Employment expectations in the manufacturing industry have already fallen sharply since the end of 2017 and are currently at their lowest level since early 2010. Aston Martin shares have lurched even lower after the carmaker posted a near-\u00a380m loss, and are now down more than 20% at 451.6p. Here is our story: Investment in Britain\u2019s car industry has ground to a halt amid fears over Brexit, with a \u201cpitiful\u201d \u00a390m pledged for new developments in the first six months of this year, according to the industry body, our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Caroll writes. The Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders has told Britain\u2019s new prime minister Boris Johnson that a Brexit deal is essential to help the embattled industry to bounce back, or carmakers will need the same type of tax breaks farmers get to stay afloat. The pound has rebounded slightly from a 28-month low hit earlier this week, trading more than 0.1% higher against both the dollar and the euro. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at trading platform Spreadex, said: Hardly a robust recovery after the multi-year-low-hitting panic of the last couple of sessions, but better than the alternative. Not that there weren\u2019t negative headlines for the pound to glom onto \u2013 members of Congress have warned that any future US-UK trade deal would be blocked if it endangered peace in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile Dignity, Britain\u2019s biggest listed funeral services firm, has axed its dividend after its underlying pre-tax profits almost halved in the first six months of this year to \u00a323.9m. The shares are down almost 10%. It said it had been hit by a drop in the number of funerals it conducted and a shift towards cheaper, no-frills services. Consumers are becoming more demanding and sophisticated. Values are changing, with increased secularism and a growing demand for personalised, lower-cost services, supported with online resources. There are fewer visits to the high street and more online research and shopping around. Britain\u2019s competition watchdog has been investigating the funerals sector, where prices are much higher than in the rest of Europe. Shares in Taylor Wimpey, the housebuilder, fell 4% after a 9.4% slide in underlying pre-tax profits to \u00a3300m in the first half \u2013 despite a special 2020 dividend of 11p a share. The FTSE 100, now down 0.24%, has also been dragged down by wealth manager St James\u2019s Place and highstreet bank Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, said profits were hit by another \u00a3550m charge related to claims or mis-sold payment protection insurance. The bank posted a pre-tax profit of \u00a32.9bn for the first half of the year, below City forecasts of \u00a33.45bn, sending its shares 4.4% lower. Its chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio said the deepening Brexit crisis had dragged down business confidence. St James\u2019s Place shares are down 5.6% after it also missed profit expectations due to weaker sentiment among the wealth manager\u2019s clients. In a flurry of corporate news, the luxury British carmaker Aston Martin has slumped to a half-year loss following a near-20% drop in European demand. The shares, which floated at \u00a319 last October, fell 17% to a mere 473.2p this morning. James Bond\u2019s favourite car marque has had a tough year since it debuted on the London Stock Exchange with much fanfare. The Dax fell 2.18% yesterday with all sectors trading lower, with disappointing earnings from Lufthansa. We were expecting the German stock market to bounce back today but it\u2019s flat at the moment. Trade worries have resurfaced, after Donald Trump talked China down on Twitter yesterday \u2013 while US and Chinese officials kicked off a new round of trade talks in Shanghai. European stock markets have disappointed at the open. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC opened flat while markets in Spain, Italy and Portugal rose slightly. In London, the FTSE 100 index is down 0.15%, or 11.5 points, at 7634.82. Consumers are propping up the UK\u2019s economic performance but key sectors are showing signs of strain as Boris Johnson threatens to take the UK out of the EU without a deal, according to analysis by my economics colleague Richard Partington. To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian monitors eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After yesterday\u2019s heavy losses, European markets are expected to bounce back today ahead of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s rate decision. A number of disappointing corporate earnings reports and weak economic data, along with trade and Brexit worries sent shares lower yesterday. The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates today for the first time in a decade, by a quarter point to a target range of 2% to 2.25%. The Fed\u2019s policy statement and chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference will be closely watched for any clues as to whether there will be further rate cuts in coming months. Economists at Daiwa said: We would expect a relatively dovish assessment, underscoring the downside risks to the outlook from abroad and concerns that US inflation will remain below target for far longer than originally anticipated, therefore leaving the door open for further cuts this year. Before that, in the eurozone we will get the first estimates of GDP for the second quarter and July inflation. Last week, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi issued a bleak assessment, saying that the eurozone\u2019s economic outlook is getting \u201cworse and worse\u201d \u2013 and that the bank should inject more stimulus. GDP growth is expected to have slowed to 0.2% between April and June, half the pace seen in the first three months of the year. However, German retail sales for June were much better than expected with a monthly increase of 3.5%, following a decline of 0.6% in June, according to data released this morning. In Asia, shares fell, rattled by fresh trade war fears after Donald Trump issued new threats to Beijing. As a new round of trade talks between the US and China started in Shanghai, Trump tweeted that if he is re-elected in November 2020, \u201cthe deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now...or no deal at all\u201d. The pound remains under pressure amid rising fears of a disorderly Brexit and is trading at $1.2155, after falling to $1.2120 on Tuesday, rattled by the no-deal rhetoric by Boris Johnson\u2019s government. It has lost more than 4% so far this month and is on track for its worst monthly performance since October 2016. The latest house price index from the building society Nationwide, out this morning, showed house prices rose 0.3% in July from June, while the annual rate slowed to 0.3% from 0.5%. Nationwide said uncertainty about Brexit and its impact on the economy were acting as a drag on the market.

      "body": "<p>Germany\u2019s interior minister has called for restraint after far-right politicians sought to exploit for political gain the death of an eight-year-old boy who was pushed in front of a train at Frankfurt station this week.</p> <p>An Eritrean-born man who lives in Switzerland is accused of pushing the boy and his mother onto the tracks. The mother was able to roll to safety under the platform seconds before a high-speed train hit her son, killing him instantly. </p> <p>Local media reported that the boy and his mother were on their way to Austria for their summer holiday at the time of the attack. The suspect fled but was intercepted by passengers, including an off-duty police officer, who tackled him to the ground. He faces charges of murder and attempted murder.</p> <p>\u201cThe country is polarised,\u201d Horst Seehofer, the German interior minister, said on Wednesday, and even though actual crime levels were down, \u201cthe feeling of security in the population is very strained right now\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Germany\u2019s interior minister has called for restraint after far-right politicians sought to exploit for political gain the death of an eight-year-old boy who was pushed in front of a train at Frankfurt station this week. An Eritrean-born man who lives in Switzerland is accused of pushing the boy and his mother onto the tracks. The mother was able to roll to safety under the platform seconds before a high-speed train hit her son, killing him instantly. Local media reported that the boy and his mother were on their way to Austria for their summer holiday at the time of the attack. The suspect fled but was intercepted by passengers, including an off-duty police officer, who tackled him to the ground. He faces charges of murder and attempted murder. \u201cThe country is polarised,\u201d Horst Seehofer, the German interior minister, said on Wednesday, and even though actual crime levels were down, \u201cthe feeling of security in the population is very strained right now\u201d. Strict measures must be taken against criminals, he added, but \u201cwe cannot allow either the exploitation nor the downplaying of crimes by immigrants\u201d. Politicians from the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) were quick to emphasise the fact that the suspect, identified by police as Habte Araya, was an Eritrean on the run from police in neighbouring Switzerland. Shortly after the attack, AfD \u2013 alluding to the summer and autumn of 2015 when the chancellor, Angela Merkel, allowed an estimated 1 million refugees into the country \u2013 tweeted: \u201cHow many citizens have to be offered up on the altar of this welcome culture which knows no bounds?\u201d Alice Weidel, the party\u2019s co-leader, said the attack was the latest evidence that the government\u2019s open policy towards refugees in 2015 had put Germans in danger. \u201cThe horror of this crime can hardly be beaten,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cWhat else needs to happen? Once and for all protect the citizens of this country instead of this boundless welcome culture!\u201d Konstantin von Notz, a Green MP, called Weidel\u2019s tweet \u201cappalling\u201d and accused her of making political capital out of the Frankfurt killing. \u201cTo connect the harrowing crime in Frankfurt with the 2015 refugee crisis in order to profit from it, is glaringly false and politically simply the most extreme level of disgusting \u2013 though it\u2019s clearly part of the AfD\u2019s method,\u201d he tweeted. The Frankfurt killing is the latest in a series of high-profile crimes perpetrated by non-German citizens - including the gang rape of an 18-year-old-girl in the Ruhr valley town of M\u00fclheim by Bulgarian youths and the death of a 34-year-old woman who was also pushed onto train tracks, for which a Kosovan man has been charged \u2013 which the AfD has seized on. The party\u2019s unrelenting criticism of Merkel\u2019s so-called \u201copen door\u201d approach has helped fuel its elevation to the main opposition party in the Bundestag. Tensions are also running high over a series of crimes attributed to the far right, including the racially motivated shooting of a 26-year-old Eritrean man in W\u00e4chtersbach, near Frankfurt, threats made against members of the far-left Die Linke party and attacks on mosques across the country. The most prominent incident in recent months was the murder of the pro-refugee Christian Democratic Union politician Walter L\u00fcbcke. According to prosecutors his suspected killer has numerous links to the far right. Since Monday passersby have being laying flowers, cuddly toys, candles and chocolates on platform seven, where the boy died. A fierce debate over how to protect Germany\u2019s rail passengers is dominating news networks, with many calling for a greater police presence and more closed-circuit television. Hundreds of people gathered at the station on Tuesday night for an event organised by the railway\u2019s religious mission to pay tribute to the boy and express support to his family. Police separated about 50 far-right demonstrators from the rest of the crowd, including a woman who held a banner which read \u201cThis politics is killing the people\u201d. A man aligned to a leftwing group shouted in her direction: \u201cHe should have pushed you in front of the train.\u201d People should not allow \u201chatred to spread\u201d, said Carsten Baumann, the head of the railway mission, who called for unity. \u201cA glance at social media shows that this crime is being misused in order to divide society.

But I got the job.</p> <p>I went to West Berlin in 1982 to document what was called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/berlinwall\">Mauerkrankheit</a></em>, which roughly translates as \u201cwall sickness\u201d. It was a disorder, identified in Berlin, caused by the fact that you\u2019re living in this divided city, surrounded by the tension between the Soviet and American sectors. It\u2019s a slow-motion trauma that culminates in depression. I heard that nearly 10% of people living in the east were diagnosed with it.</p> <p>In the west, I discovered a different side to the disorder. Every Saturday, punks would hang out, drink beer and blare music through their soundsystems. Cars would be set alight and bank windows smashed in. The cops would arrive, teargas them and send them running to find shelter in nearby bars, and the whole cycle would repeat. They were sceptical of me to begin with. One guy even headbutted me. In retrospect, I think that was a sign of acceptance.</p> <p>Getting to know them wasn\u2019t easy, and it happened in the strangest of ways.

In early August Rwanda&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/01/rwanda-closes-border-with-dr-congo-over-deadly-ebola-outbreak-goma\">announced that it was closing its border with DRC</a>.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has long said that the national and regional risk levels are very high and containment of the spread to North Kivu and Ituri provinces was unlikely, unless a break in the fighting made it safe for health workers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is Ebola and how do you treat it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola</a>&nbsp;hemorrhagic fever is caused by a virus that has a reservoir among forest animals, including monkeys and bats. It is spread through body fluids, which is why carers \u2013 mostly female relatives and nursing staff \u2013 are particularly at risk. It causes fever, aches and diarrhoea and attacks the immune system, causing blood clotting cells to malfunction so that victims bleed extensively and die if their immune system cannot fight off the viral infection.</p>\n    <p>Drugs are still experimental. Patients are isolated and treated by nurses wearing full protective body suits and masks who try to boost their immune response. Friends and relatives are quarantined for 21 days. Prevention measures include washing hands at every opportunity and safe burial practices, with no touching or washing of the body, as is traditional in some cultures.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How does this compare with other outbreaks?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The 2013 and 2016 outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea spread for months through forest regions in west&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a>&nbsp;where Ebola was unknown before the emergency was recognised. It escalated when it emerged in towns and cities, with 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths.</p>\n    <p>DRC successfully stamped out nine previous Ebola outbreaks in rural areas within a matter of a few months.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/aid\">Aid</a>&nbsp;agencies, infectious disease experts and the WHO say it will be very hard to bring this outbreak under control, even though they have had vaccines and experimental drugs from the outset.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the contributing factors to this outbreak?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is almost no functioning state in much of eastern DRC. There is an almost total lack of basic services such as power, education, roads, healthcare, and the authority of the government only extends to the edges of urban areas.</p>\n    <p>Police are corrupt, predatory and violent. In rural zones, militia and armed bands provide security and employment opportunities but also steal, rape and kill at will. It is one of the most hostile environments faced by aid and health workers anywhere in the world.</p>\n    <p>Mistrust of officials and foreigners is harming efforts to tackle the disease and conspiracy theories are rampant. Some believe the outbreak is fake news spread by rapacious NGOs and the UN to justify their presence in the country and allow the extraction of valuable mineral resources.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jasonburke\"><b>Jason Burke</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The escalating crisis has led to a row within the DRC\u2019s health ministry, which is co-ordinating national efforts to contain the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>Last week, DRC\u2019s health minister <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-49077156\">Olly Ilunga resigned</a> in protest against the country\u2019s handling of the Ebola outbreak.

      "bodyText": "A second death linked to the Ebola virus has been confirmed in the densely populated city of Goma, located at the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s porous border with Rwanda. The first case of Ebola in Goma \u2013 an evangelical preacher \u2013 contributed to the World Health Organization decision to declare the Ebola crisis in DRC an international public health emergency. The city, which has a population of 2 million, shares a porous land border with Rwanda and has an international airport. It is often used by international travellers as a gateway to DRC. The Ebola outbreak in DRC began exactly a year ago on Thursday and has claimed more than 1,803 lives, according to figures published on Wednesday, making it the second deadliest outbreak of the disease on record. The second patient began showing symptoms of the disease on 22 July, after arriving in Goma from DRC\u2019s northeastern Ituri province, according to Associated Press reports. Aruna Abedi, in charge of coordinating the Ebola response in North Kivu, the worst-hit province, said the second patient had already been ill for 11 days before he sought treatment. \u201cHis was really a hopeless case, because the illness was already at an advanced stage and he died overnight Tuesday,\u201d Abedi said. The case is not connected to the one previously detected in Goma. The escalating crisis has led to a row within the DRC\u2019s health ministry, which is co-ordinating national efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Last week, DRC\u2019s health minister Olly Ilunga resigned in protest against the country\u2019s handling of the Ebola outbreak. Ilunga said international agencies were pressuring his government to allow the testing of a new vaccine developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson. The row over the vaccine trials began after Ilunga banned clinical trials of the new vaccine in DRC, according to Stat News. Ebola vaccines are difficult to develop because they have to be tested during outbreaks. In the previous outbreak in West Africa, one vaccine, produced by Merck, was successfully trialled in Guinea. The success of that trial meant preventative Merck vaccines could be given to citizens in the DRC and potentially contain the outbreak. But Ilunga has argued that trialling vaccines in Ebola-affected regions could erode public trust in the government. Merck\u2019s vaccine requires only a single shot, whereas Johnson&amp; Johnson\u2019s new vaccine has to be taken in two doses. Officials and NGOs fear that discrepancies in the vaccination schedules \u2013 where some people were getting one shot, while others were getting two \u2013 could fuel rumours about the vaccines in local communities. Ilunga also said that delivering two doses would be logistically difficult in a region where there is a high rate of displacement and where people frequently travel. \u201cHow can you, in an environment where people are traveling a lot, where people have no identity card, how can you organise a two-dosage vaccination in rural areas?\u201d he was reported as saying. \u201cYou vaccinate somebody today and say, \u2018Come back two months later\u2019 \u2026 even from a logistical point of view, it\u2019s not feasible.\u201d Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, who is now heading the Ebola response in DRC said Goma had been preparing for more Ebola cases for many months, and that the latest patient would receive treatment at a facility in the city. \u201cThe response teams continue to work to decontaminate the home [of the patient] and the high-risk contacts of the case have been identified and will be vaccinated from tomorrow,\u201d Muyembe-Tamfum said.",

Now UK audiences can see her directorial debut Holiday (co-scripted by her with Johanne Algren), an icily accomplished drama about sexual violence, toxic masculinity and toxic femininity, in a pretty familiar Euro-hardcore style not dissimilar to the manner of shock veterans such as Ulrich Seidl or Gaspar No\u00e9.</p> <p>It\u2019s about a damaged and dysfunctional young woman gradually becoming complicit in the abusive relationship she is having with her middle-aged gangster employer/boyfriend: a kind of Stockholm-Vichy syndrome.

With the glittering waters of the ocean and the Hockney blue of the infinity pools around which young women are expected to dance decorative attendance on fatter, older, paranoid guys, this is a world that can only be called Hate Island.</p> <p>Victoria Carmen Sonne gives a horribly convincing and mesmerically uncomfortable performance as Sascha, a young woman in skimpy swimwear who is the trophy girlfriend and abuse victim of Michael (Lai Yde), a gang boss who presides over a cringing court of mob lieutenants and their various mums and kids. Sonne brilliantly shows Sascha\u2019s creepy, childlike narcissism, gazing at her reflection in changing room mirrors in a celebratory stupor. She zooms about the place on a motor-scooter, wearing a floating, trailing, Isadora Duncan-type scarf. A local tries to warn her about the danger of this accessory but Sascha won\u2019t listen.

Then there is the yet more sinister Bobby (Yuval Segal), another violent man with a pterodactyl expression whose abusive relationship with Sascha may or may not be known to Michael.

      "body": "<p>My book, <a href=\"http://www.stuartkells.com/thelibrary/\">The Library: A Catalogue of Wonders</a>, began as an essay on writers\u2019 libraries but quickly grew to encompass public and fictional ones as well. Ancient, modern and imaginary libraries have all accumulated compelling and irresistible stories. </p> <p>Mysterious filaments connect fictional libraries to each other, and to real libraries. Here are my favourites.</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong><a href=\"http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/1065-Bag-End-A-Very-English-Place.php\">The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien</a><br></strong>Tolkien\u2019s works are set in an exquisitely realised fantasy world that features grand libraries, such as those of Minas Tirith and Rivendell, but also humble ones, such as those of the Shire. The best Shire libraries are at Undertowers, Great Smials, Brandy Hall and Bag End, an English country house in miniature and underground. Bag End has everything a civilised Hobbit could ever need: panelled walls, a tiled floor, fireplace, fine furniture and low bookshelves \u2013 because Hobbits don\u2019t like ladders.<em> </em>The Lord of the Rings features accurate descriptions of tablets, scrolls, codices and even the bindings of fabled Shire books such as the Red Book of Westmarch, and the Yearbook of Tuckborough, known as Yellowskin.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n04/adam-smyth/not-to-be-read-without-shuddering\">The Catalogue of Rare Books Not for Sale by John Donne</a><br></strong>When Paul Masson noticed that the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale had few Latin and Italian books from the 15th century, he decided to fabricate a list of volumes that would enhance the catalogue. What, <a href=\"https://www.akg-images.co.uk/archive/-2UMEBMBZBSDF7.html\">Colette asked</a>, was the use of books that did not exist? \u201cWell,\u201d Masson answered indignantly, \u201cI can\u2019t be expected to think of everything!\u201d Sometime between 1603 and 1611, Donne produced this similarly fanciful booklist. Its imaginary titles \u2013 such as Hoby\u2019s Afternoon Belchings and Luther\u2019s On Shortening the Lord\u2019s Prayer \u2013&#xa0;aimed to impart pseudo-wisdom to courtiers. Also in this tradition of imaginary booklists is <a href=\"http://thingfinder.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-codpiece-of-law.html\">the catalogue compiled by Rabelais</a> that includes The Codpiece of the Law, The Testes of Theology and Martingale Breeches with Back-flaps for Turd-droppers.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"http://speculiction.blogspot.com/2014/08/review-of-tik-tok-by-john-sladek.html\">Tik-Tok by John Sladek</a><br></strong>This 1983 novel is about a cynical robot that becomes vice president of the US. Sladek imagines a vast, interplanetary mobile library aboard the Liberian-registered Doodlebug, a luxurious spaceship for interplanetary tourists. After an economic slump, the ship is repurposed to transport livestock. Tik-Tok frequents the silent ballroom, the deluxe bathrooms and the first-class library, which he consults by category: books about Mars; autobiographies of former nuns; books that feature a robot named Robbie; books whose titles begin with \u201cU\u201d and which conceal \u201cprofane meanings\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8dfb8354145cbd8f85889ec060db40c8b87b8ad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dfb8354145cbd8f85889ec060db40c8b87b8ad0/0_0_3438_5200/661.jpg\" alt=\"A long way from Babel \u2026 Jorge Luis Borges at home in Buenos Aires in 1983.\" width=\"661\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A long way from Babel \u2026 Jorge Luis Borges at home in Buenos Aires in 1983.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Pillitz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jan/03/fiction.jorgeluisborges\">The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges</a> <br></strong>In 1938, Borges banged his head and entered a speechless delirium. His mother revived him by reading aloud from CS Lewis. Soon after, Borges conceived this vision of an infinite library composed of interconnected hexagonal rooms, all identical and containing standardised bookshelves and randomised books. In this infinite repository, most texts are gibberish but many are not. The library contains every book ever written, as well as every book that might be. Sought after titles include: \u201cEverything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels\u2019 autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Basilides\">gospel of Basilides</a>, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages \u2026 \u201d</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/umberto-eco-obituary\">The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco</a></strong><br>In a Benedictine monastery, Eco had an epiphany that led him to create the most captivating library in fiction: the abbey library in this international bestseller. When constructing the collection, Eco had in mind Borges\u2019s labyrinth. As finally conceived, it features hexagonal rooms and a librarian, \u201cJorge da Burgos\u201d. Perhaps oddly, Eco\u2019s book rooms are less historically accurate than Tolkien\u2019s. The chief libraries of medieval Europe held fewer than 2,000 volumes. Eco\u2019s abbey library of an impossible 87,000 books drew criticism from mediaevalists. But, as Lucien Polastron noted, \u201cDream and fantasy laugh at accountants.\u201d</p> <p><strong>6. The Cemetery of Lost Books in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview25\">The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n</a><br></strong>In Zaf\u00f3n\u2019s baroque novel, Daniel Sempere hides a volume in this secret collection, itself hidden in the heart of old Barcelona. Zaf\u00f3n took inspiration from galleries of mirrors; stories within stories; the multi-level bookshop of <a href=\"https://www.francisedwards.co.uk/\">Francis Edwards in Hay-on-Wye</a>; the multi-room London bookshop <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26881734\">of Wilfrid Voynich</a>, said to have been organised in a deliberate sequence of crammed spaces so as to enhance the sense of drama and discovery; Eco\u2019s abbey library; and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/library/The-effects-of-the-French-Revolution#ref249369\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/library/The-effects-of-the-French-Revolution#ref249369\">d\u00e9p\u00f4ts litt\u00e9raires </a></em><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/library/The-effects-of-the-French-Revolution#ref249369\">of revolutionary France</a>, in which looted books were amassed on a brutal scale.</p> <p><strong>7. The Citadel Library in A Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin<br></strong>In the bestselling fantasy series, the Citadel at Oldtown features a great library \u2013 the largest of its kind in Westeros \u2013 that is a medieval marvel. As realised in Game of Thrones on TV, the library features a vast central hall in which a suspended structure of lenses and mirrors diffuses natural light. The library\u2019s most valuable and dangerous books are stored behind locked gates, and are chained to the shelves, just as they are at <a href=\"https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Unseen_University\">Unseen University on Discworld</a> and in the <a href=\"https://www.herefordcathedral.org/chained-library\">cathedral library of Hereford</a>.</p> <p><strong>8. Peter Kien\u2019s books in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/07/featuresreviews.guardianreview25\">Auto-da-F\u00e9 by Elias Canetti</a><br></strong>Peter Kien, a middle-aged Sinologist, assembles some 25,000 volumes in his Vienna apartment. His insatiable appetite for books is matched only by the fear that they will be lost in fire. He marries his sturdy housekeeper with the idea that she will help keep the books safe. Instead, she forces him out of his apartment and he enters a nightmarish world of cutthroats, con artists, seedy bars and bungling police. The book ends with a powerful depiction of the horror of burning books.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/12/top-10-fictional-booksellers\">Top 10 fictional booksellers</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://jeroenthoughts.wordpress.com/2015/11/20/jack-vance-night-lamp-1996/\">Night Lamp by Jack Vance</a><br></strong>In the abandoned palace of Somar, the characters Jaro and Skirl find a library crowded with ancient illustrated books that smell pleasantly of wax and preservative. Part diary, part poem, each book is a repository of a unique artistic vision that allows the author to live for ever in a half-dream within the lovingly created pages. Behind the library walls are passages that lead to safe houses and the homes of ghouls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"659bc92e840192120343ec3eda94995d650b1cdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/659bc92e840192120343ec3eda94995d650b1cdb/0_568_3300_1979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Night Bookmobile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unpredictable opening hours \u2026 The Night Bookmobile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Audrey Niffenegger</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/108/1085316/the-night-bookmobile/9780224089524.html\">The Night Bookmobile by Audrey Niffenegger</a></strong><br>Another fantastical treatment of books and death. A young woman encounters a mobile library, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/nightbookmobile?page=2\">a kind of Winnebago\u2013Tardis</a>, that contains every book she has ever read or skimmed. The librarian, Mr Openshaw, carefully curates the collection. The woman searches but doesn\u2019t see it for another nine years. When she meets Openshaw again, she begs to become his assistant. He refuses but she studies librarianship and goes to work at the Chicago Public Library. Twelve years on, she is reunited with Openshaw and the Bookmobile, but he again refuses to hire her before the decisive event I won\u2019t spoil. </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.stuartkells.com/thelibrary/\">The Library: A Catalogue of Wonders</a> by Stuart Kells is published by Text.<br></p>",

The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco In a Benedictine monastery, Eco had an epiphany that led him to create the most captivating library in fiction: the abbey library in this international bestseller. When constructing the collection, Eco had in mind Borges\u2019s labyrinth. As finally conceived, it features hexagonal rooms and a librarian, \u201cJorge da Burgos\u201d. Perhaps oddly, Eco\u2019s book rooms are less historically accurate than Tolkien\u2019s. The chief libraries of medieval Europe held fewer than 2,000 volumes. Eco\u2019s abbey library of an impossible 87,000 books drew criticism from mediaevalists. But, as Lucien Polastron noted, \u201cDream and fantasy laugh at accountants.\u201d 6. The Cemetery of Lost Books in The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n In Zaf\u00f3n\u2019s baroque novel, Daniel Sempere hides a volume in this secret collection, itself hidden in the heart of old Barcelona. Zaf\u00f3n took inspiration from galleries of mirrors; stories within stories; the multi-level bookshop of Francis Edwards in Hay-on-Wye; the multi-room London bookshop of Wilfrid Voynich, said to have been organised in a deliberate sequence of crammed spaces so as to enhance the sense of drama and discovery; Eco\u2019s abbey library; and the d\u00e9p\u00f4ts litt\u00e9raires of revolutionary France, in which looted books were amassed on a brutal scale. 7. The Citadel Library in A Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin In the bestselling fantasy series, the Citadel at Oldtown features a great library \u2013 the largest of its kind in Westeros \u2013 that is a medieval marvel. As realised in Game of Thrones on TV, the library features a vast central hall in which a suspended structure of lenses and mirrors diffuses natural light. The library\u2019s most valuable and dangerous books are stored behind locked gates, and are chained to the shelves, just as they are at Unseen University on Discworld and in the cathedral library of Hereford. 8. Peter Kien\u2019s books in Auto-da-F\u00e9 by Elias Canetti Peter Kien, a middle-aged Sinologist, assembles some 25,000 volumes in his Vienna apartment. His insatiable appetite for books is matched only by the fear that they will be lost in fire. He marries his sturdy housekeeper with the idea that she will help keep the books safe. Instead, she forces him out of his apartment and he enters a nightmarish world of cutthroats, con artists, seedy bars and bungling police. The book ends with a powerful depiction of the horror of burning books. 9. Night Lamp by Jack Vance In the abandoned palace of Somar, the characters Jaro and Skirl find a library crowded with ancient illustrated books that smell pleasantly of wax and preservative. Part diary, part poem, each book is a repository of a unique artistic vision that allows the author to live for ever in a half-dream within the lovingly created pages. Behind the library walls are passages that lead to safe houses and the homes of ghouls. 10. The Night Bookmobile by Audrey Niffenegger Another fantastical treatment of books and death. A young woman encounters a mobile library, a kind of Winnebago\u2013Tardis, that contains every book she has ever read or skimmed. The librarian, Mr Openshaw, carefully curates the collection. The woman searches but doesn\u2019t see it for another nine years. When she meets Openshaw again, she begs to become his assistant. He refuses but she studies librarianship and goes to work at the Chicago Public Library. Twelve years on, she is reunited with Openshaw and the Bookmobile, but he again refuses to hire her before the decisive event I won\u2019t spoil. \u2022 The Library: A Catalogue of Wonders by Stuart Kells is published by Text.",

      "bodyText": "The family of a Libyan member of parliament and campaigner abducted by armed men two weeks ago fear she may have been subjected to torture and sexual violence. Seham Sergiwa, who is also a prominent women\u2019s rights activist, disappeared from her home in the eastern city of Benghazi on 17 July and has not been heard from since. Relatives believe Sergiwa, 56, may have been silenced by forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar, the 75-year-old military strongman who controls much of the east of the country. Hours before the abduction, Sergiwa, who has has a doctorate in clinical psychology, told an interviewer on a pro-Haftar TV channel that Haftar\u2019s supporters included \u201cextremists\u201d, and called for the Muslim Brotherhood, the major Islamist organisation seen as a principal foe by Haftar, to be included in a unity government. Sergiwa has repeatedly criticised the continuing offensive launched by Haftar\u2019s self-styled Libyan National Army against Tripoli, the capital and seat of the fragile UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), in April. Her husband was shot in the legs during the raid and was badly beaten. Her 14-year-old son was also assaulted and injured. Both were in hospital for several days. \u201cWe have had no news since the abduction,\u201d said Sergiwa\u2019s niece Nicole, speaking from Indiana in the US. \u201cWe thought it might just be an arrest, even though her family was beaten and shot up. But we are worrying that she is still alive and being hurt in ways we cannot imagine \u2026 torture, rape.\u201d Sergiwa came to prominence as a campaigner against sexual violence in Libya after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, and was elected to the country\u2019s new legislative assembly in 2014. \u201cShe is truly an amazing person who speaks her mind. She would never compromise her principles. She does what she thinks is right. She has been speaking out forcefully against Haftar,\u201d her niece said. The family say masked members of the 106th Brigade, a force commanded by one of Haftar\u2019s sons, were seen at Sergiwa\u2019s home when she was taken away. Witnesses also described fighters from other armed groups present during the raid, including at least one militia faction with a reputation for brutal treatment of civilians. The words \u201cthe army is a red line\u201d were sprayed on the outside of the house, an apparent warning to other critics of Haftar\u2019s forces. Libya has been plunged into a new crisis by Haftar\u2019s offensive which has so far led to more than a thousand civilian deaths and derailed diplomatic efforts to reconcile two rival armed political factions. After rapid early gains, Haftar\u2019s forces have stalled as resistance by a coalition of militias fighting for the GNA has hardened. Jalel Harchaoui, of the Clingendael Institute, a thinktank based in The Hague, said the military setbacks had undermined the authority of Haftar and his forces. One consequence was that the slightest criticism could provoke a very strong reaction. \u201cSergiwa is a highly educated woman, clearly someone who has shown a commitment to liberal values and human rights. She is not a crusader against Haftar but wanted to show the world there was a way to be independent \u2026 But it is a very, very polarised atmosphere,\u201d Harchaoui said. A spokesman for the Benghazi-based government\u2019s interior ministry, Tarek El-Kharraz, said an investigation was under way to determine Sergiwa\u2019s whereabouts, but denied any involvement by forces loyal to Haftar in her disappearance. The UN support mission in Libya has expressed its concern over Sergiwa\u2019s disappearance and called on Libyan authorities to investigate the matter, warning against \u201cunlawful arrest and abduction based on political views\u201d. Tim Eaton, an analyst at London\u2019s Chatham House, said the abduction was a clear indication that Haftar or his associates would not tolerate dissent about the Tripoli offensive. \u201cIt is a snapshot of an army \u2026 that is increasingly intolerant of dissent and unwilling to subject itself to civilian authority,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cThe broader context is that the April offensive was launched when the United Nations secretary general was in Tripoli advocating a political settlement, which shows that Haftar\u2019s forces don\u2019t attach much credibility to the UN. The muted international response to the offensive proved them correct.\u201d As in Syria and Yemen, the conflict in Libya has been aggravated by regional rivalries. Turkey and Qatar have broadly supported western forces, while the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt have backed the east, with growing tacit support from the French. Italy, France and the UN have run often competing peace processes, sometimes reflecting commercial interests. The French government, the European power closest to Haftar, insists it had no prior warning of his assault. Analysts say the outcome could shape not just the politics of Libya, but also the security of the Mediterranean, and the relevance of democracy across the Middle East and north Africa. A statement from the family described Sergiwa as \u201ca moderate and progressive woman\u201d who had returned from the UK to help her country. \u201cThe silencing of women and democracy in favour of dictatorship should not be tolerated. Above all, Seham is not only a politician, but a mother, daughter, sister and wife. We desperately want to welcome her home alive,\u201d the statement said.",

Chekhov wrote the play as a comedy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/30/rupert-everett-uncle-vanya-theatre-royal-bath?CMP=share_btn_tw\">Everett told the Guardian recently</a>, and while his production is not the first to draw out the absurdist elements of this fin-de-si\u00e8cle masterpiece about mid-life malaise, fewer have gone as far as this daringly jaunty production, adapted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/28/david-hare-boris-johnson-tom-hiddleston-betrayal-the-night-manager-delay-marina-wheeler\">David Hare</a>.</p> <p>Much of the comedy is delivered by Everett himself, who gives a flamboyant performance as a louche, growly Vanya, wandering around barefoot and eking out pained humour from lines as lugubrious as: \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect day to hang yourself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"578ef16c72a9bb5b8565d6a0ac541692f442aacf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/578ef16c72a9bb5b8565d6a0ac541692f442aacf/0_0_2400_2084/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy as Yelena and Katherine Parkinson as Sonya in Uncle Vanya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"868\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elegant restraint \u2026 Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy as Yelena and Katherine Parkinson as Sonya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nobby Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not all, however, attest to the play\u2019s outright success as a comedy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2015/aug/07/cate-blanchett-and-richard-roxburgh-two-decades-on-stage-for-the-sydney-theatre-company-in-pictures\">Richard </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2015/aug/07/cate-blanchett-and-richard-roxburgh-two-decades-on-stage-for-the-sydney-theatre-company-in-pictures\">Roxburgh</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2015/aug/07/cate-blanchett-and-richard-roxburgh-two-decades-on-stage-for-the-sydney-theatre-company-in-pictures\">, who played Vanya opposite Cate Blanchett</a> in the Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s acclaimed 2012 production, likened it to a No\u00ebl Coward play without the jokes, and it feels occasionally thus in this production. Some actors \u2013 particularly John Light as the defeated Dr Astrov and Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy as Yelena, the beautiful, bored wife of the elderly professor \u2013 seem to be playing it straight, which grates against the comic elements.</p> <p>But the tonal inconsistencies are ironed out so that the depression and despair is balanced against the bursts of farce and bathos. Katherine Parkinson steers brilliantly between humour and torment as Vanya\u2019s plain niece, Sonya, and is winningly dorky around Astrov, for whom she harbours a passion. Her shift to pathos, when her love is not returned, is done with pitch perfection. Meanwhile, the small part of the nursemaid, Marina, is made big with characterful humour in Ann Mitchell\u2019s hands.</p> <p>Not everything works seamlessly: Yelena, who sparks much of the play\u2019s emotional turbulence, is played with elegant restraint by Po\u00e9sy but her relationship to the professor is neglected. Light is a likable misanthrope as Dr Astrov, and we feel his despair as a medic with disease and death rising in the peasant population around him. But his interest in trees and reforestation as an alternative way to save humanity is turned rather too heavy handedly into a climate-change message in Hare\u2019s script.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e75df6f0ffff08fa96c0a298a8b9863dd56ce7ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e75df6f0ffff08fa96c0a298a8b9863dd56ce7ba/87_187_2538_1523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Parkinson with Rupert Everett.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katherine Parkinson with Rupert Everett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nobby Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the second half, the comedy begins to glitter and gleam against Chekhovian darkness. The pressure-cooker blend of boredom, disappointment and simmering anger builds to boiling point as the cast languishes in the Russian countryside, barricaded by their bourgeois privilege against the pestilence and poverty of the peasants who surround them.</p> <p>The scene of Dr Astrov\u2019s stolen kiss with Yelena, when it comes, is a powerful one, set against the tragicomedy of Vanya\u2019s own fast-wilting romantic hopes.

      "bodyText": "Last year, Rupert Everett gave a heart-wrenching performance in The Happy Prince, a film about the elderly Oscar Wilde in which he played the writer not as a predictably witty dandy but a tragic figure stuttering towards the end of his life. Here, in his directorial stage debut, Everett approaches Uncle Vanya with a similarly counterintuitive touch. Chekhov wrote the play as a comedy, Everett told the Guardian recently, and while his production is not the first to draw out the absurdist elements of this fin-de-si\u00e8cle masterpiece about mid-life malaise, fewer have gone as far as this daringly jaunty production, adapted by David Hare. Much of the comedy is delivered by Everett himself, who gives a flamboyant performance as a louche, growly Vanya, wandering around barefoot and eking out pained humour from lines as lugubrious as: \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect day to hang yourself.\u201d Not all, however, attest to the play\u2019s outright success as a comedy. Richard Roxburgh, who played Vanya opposite Cate Blanchett in the Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s acclaimed 2012 production, likened it to a No\u00ebl Coward play without the jokes, and it feels occasionally thus in this production. Some actors \u2013 particularly John Light as the defeated Dr Astrov and Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy as Yelena, the beautiful, bored wife of the elderly professor \u2013 seem to be playing it straight, which grates against the comic elements. But the tonal inconsistencies are ironed out so that the depression and despair is balanced against the bursts of farce and bathos. Katherine Parkinson steers brilliantly between humour and torment as Vanya\u2019s plain niece, Sonya, and is winningly dorky around Astrov, for whom she harbours a passion. Her shift to pathos, when her love is not returned, is done with pitch perfection. Meanwhile, the small part of the nursemaid, Marina, is made big with characterful humour in Ann Mitchell\u2019s hands. Not everything works seamlessly: Yelena, who sparks much of the play\u2019s emotional turbulence, is played with elegant restraint by Po\u00e9sy but her relationship to the professor is neglected. Light is a likable misanthrope as Dr Astrov, and we feel his despair as a medic with disease and death rising in the peasant population around him. But his interest in trees and reforestation as an alternative way to save humanity is turned rather too heavy handedly into a climate-change message in Hare\u2019s script. By the second half, the comedy begins to glitter and gleam against Chekhovian darkness. The pressure-cooker blend of boredom, disappointment and simmering anger builds to boiling point as the cast languishes in the Russian countryside, barricaded by their bourgeois privilege against the pestilence and poverty of the peasants who surround them. The scene of Dr Astrov\u2019s stolen kiss with Yelena, when it comes, is a powerful one, set against the tragicomedy of Vanya\u2019s own fast-wilting romantic hopes. When the final eruption of high passion comes in his murderous attempts at the professor\u2019s life, there is a perfect meeting point between tragedy and comedy. Charles Quiggin\u2019s set draws out and deepens the romantic strains of the script in subtle, visual ways, capturing the seasons with the sounds of birds, the swish of wind against foliage, the hues of autumnal or spring light. The cast, too, form melancholy stage tableaux at times, sitting in beautiful formations that hint at psychological states. The play might be set in turn-of-the-20th-century Russia, but in these moments they appear like figures from an Edward Hopper painting, bearing all the loneliness of the modern age. \u2022 At Theatre Royal, Bath, until 3 August.",

A largely solo affair in the early days, Sweeney spent his Tuesday evenings as Beats in Space, mixing live and talking to callers. When he started working for James Murphy\u2019s DFA label, his star began to shine, tapping into the mid-00s punk-dance scene and honing his affable, downbeat charm. When he graduated in 2003, the show continued \u2013 it\u2019s now considered one of the longest running college radio shows in the US, and has featured hundreds of guest DJs.

They\u2019ve grown up on US club sounds like Chicago footwork and Baltimore bass as much as UK jungle and breaks-centric rave, and their sets feel thoroughly modern for it. While Sherelle cut her chops on youth station Reprezent Radio, their joint show on NTS Radio, XTC, is aptly named \u2013 hinting at rave legacies while focusing on the thrill of the now, with beats from 160BPM-and-climbing.</p> <p><strong>RA.686: Russell EL Butler</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/resident-advisor/ra686-russell-el-butler\">  <iframe height=\"460\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F654645554&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Russell EL Butler is a producer and DJ from Bermuda who lives in Oakland. Drawing from the Bay Area\u2019s electronic music and radical black political histories, their 2018 album, The Home I\u2019d Build for Myself and All My Friends, taps into ideas of place and African diaspora. Their core inspiration is Detroit electro duo, Drexciya, who Butler says \u201creinvented a black mythos\u201d with their emotive, oceanic electronics. For their Resident Advisor podcast, Butler finds a softer groove than on some of their solo productions: softer elements (melancholic synth pop and romantic R&amp;B) create contours in the tougher elements (modular electronics, and new house and techno jams).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/03/the-months-best-mixes-dj-duke-mczo-gabber-eleganza\">The month's best mixes: infectious singeli and full-throttle floorfillers</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Groove 216: D Tiffany</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/groove-magazin/groove-podcast-216-d-tiffany\">  <iframe height=\"460\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F649487306&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>In her hometown of Vancouver, D Tiffany hosted DIY dance parties and co-founded Intersessions, a workshop series for women to access production and DJ equipment.

      "bodyText": "Neptunian Influence: ADAB Much of the science fiction that influences electronic music comes from popular western culture: with televised rocket countdowns and moon landings, space flight is man\u2019s technological, and sometimes national, conquest of the unknown. Yet for many underground techno artists, Afrofuturism holds a deep aesthetic value: it\u2019s not a conquest of, but a return to, the cosmos, where spiritual connections and identities can flourish. For the themed mix series Neptunian Influence, Cleveland-based artist and member of underground party crew In Training, Miah Benton (AKA ADAB), creates a fascinating, psychedelic mix of hard drums, cosmic reverberations and searching voices. Beats in Space 1000 with Tim Sweeney When Tim Sweeney moved from Maryland to study at New York University in 1999, he signed up to host on the campus radio station, WNYU 89.1 FM. A largely solo affair in the early days, Sweeney spent his Tuesday evenings as Beats in Space, mixing live and talking to callers. When he started working for James Murphy\u2019s DFA label, his star began to shine, tapping into the mid-00s punk-dance scene and honing his affable, downbeat charm. When he graduated in 2003, the show continued \u2013 it\u2019s now considered one of the longest running college radio shows in the US, and has featured hundreds of guest DJs. Last week, Beats in Space celebrated its 1,000th broadcast. For these two and a half hours, it\u2019s Sweeney at the controls: playing some of his favourite records throughout the years, all punctuated by sweet messages left on the hotline by past guests. XTC with Fauzia and Sherelle Sherelle and Fauzia are two London-based DJs, radio hosts and friends who have been bringing killer selections and a sense of joy to the drum and bass scene. They\u2019ve grown up on US club sounds like Chicago footwork and Baltimore bass as much as UK jungle and breaks-centric rave, and their sets feel thoroughly modern for it. While Sherelle cut her chops on youth station Reprezent Radio, their joint show on NTS Radio, XTC, is aptly named \u2013 hinting at rave legacies while focusing on the thrill of the now, with beats from 160BPM-and-climbing. RA.686: Russell EL Butler Russell EL Butler is a producer and DJ from Bermuda who lives in Oakland. Drawing from the Bay Area\u2019s electronic music and radical black political histories, their 2018 album, The Home I\u2019d Build for Myself and All My Friends, taps into ideas of place and African diaspora. Their core inspiration is Detroit electro duo, Drexciya, who Butler says \u201creinvented a black mythos\u201d with their emotive, oceanic electronics. For their Resident Advisor podcast, Butler finds a softer groove than on some of their solo productions: softer elements (melancholic synth pop and romantic R&amp;B) create contours in the tougher elements (modular electronics, and new house and techno jams). Groove 216: D Tiffany In her hometown of Vancouver, D Tiffany hosted DIY dance parties and co-founded Intersessions, a workshop series for women to access production and DJ equipment. After spending time in Australia \u2013 where she met sister-in-sound, Roza Terenzi \u2013 she returned to Canada and started her own label, Planet Euphorique, which hits a sweet spot between deep house rhythms, dusky electro and ambient breaks. Her sound feels fresh rather than nostalgic, and there\u2019s a real playfulness to her taut, powerful blends. Keep an ear out for a moment from the Queen of Pop in this new mix for German publication Groove. Bleep Mix 71: Logos When UK producer Logos was writing his 2019 album, Imperial Flood, he spent a lot of time listening to Brian Eno\u2019s Ambient 4: On Land and thinking about ecological soundscapes. Through his record label Different Circles, which he runs with Mumdance, Logos has spent years working on a sound that\u2019s moved from \u201cweightless\u201d \u2013 ambient grime instrumentalism that uses sonic vacuums to maximise impact \u2013 into something more robust and sinister, using field recordings and sound collage to uncanny effect. This extends to his taste in techno music, and his style of DJing. In this Bleep mix, Logos focuses on tactile movements and dark energies, featuring tracks from UK contemporaries like Demdike Stare and Pessimist, among others.",

      "bodyText": "A new generation of national nature reserves are being created to help improve people\u2019s health and mitigate the effects of climatic extremes, according to the chair of the government\u2019s conservation watchdog. The South London Downs reserve is the first in a series of landscapes that will be designated a national nature reserve this year, said Tony Juniper of Natural England. Several more will follow this autumn, including what he described as one \u201cvery significant\u201d newly protected area. Juniper said these new reserves highlighted his austerity-hit agency\u2019s determination to do \u201cthe practical work of conservation\u201d that would also help the government meet its target of net zero emissions and help England adapt to global heating. The South London Downs reserve is only the third national nature reserve to be created in the capital, and protects 417 hectares (1,030 acres) of flower-rich chalk downland on the border of Croydon and Surrey. It includes Farthing Downs and Happy valley. Juniper said: \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful area of natural beauty, it\u2019s very close to where people live and another reminder of how much benefit we can get for our society through the intelligent and wise management of the natural environment and its restoration.\u201d In a wide-ranging interview on his vision for Natural England, which he admits has been \u201cmassively depleted\u201d by budget cuts, Juniper welcomed Boris Johnson\u2019s reaffirmation of the emissions target and said the agency could play \u201ca central role in helping government meet net zero\u201d. Juniper, who has campaigned on climate change for years as former executive director of Friends of the Earth, said tackling greenhouse gas emissions had so far focused on reducing the use of fossil fuels in energy and domestic heating, and electrifying transport. But he said climate change policy and the nature conservation agenda \u201cshould be two sides of the same coin\u201d. Restoring peatland helps capture carbon and prevent flooding, for instance, while forest restoration and wildlife-friendly food production can also sequester more carbon. Juniper also explained how natural systems can help adapt to global heating \u2013 such as planting trees in cities to lessen the urban heat island effect during heatwaves. \u201cImproving the health of natural systems is one of our most cost-effective and effective ways of achieving adaptation to climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe opportunity to harness nature-based solutions is huge but it does require quite a lot of joining up.\u201d According to Juniper, such solutions require a coordinated effort across government and its agencies including Natural England, the Forestry Commission and the Environment Agency. Juniper said he hoped nature could be restored in England through legally binding targets similar to those for climate change, via a post-Brexit environment bill. Biodiversity would be measured using existing datasets on water quality, farmland birds, areas of flower-rich grassland and insect abundance, with successive governments committed to improvement. \u201cIt\u2019s really about the extent to which the country wants to own that kind of long-term ambition, and I think we do,\u201d he said. Juniper welcomed the emergence of Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes and said such mass protests helped him fight for more resources within government. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s possible to think there\u2019s some activists and a minority interest calling for big ambitious goals but actually when it appears as it is \u2013 a much more mainstream agenda \u2013 that helps enormously. When it comes to the children and the school strikes, nobody has got more moral authority than the young people who will own the consequences,\u201d he said. Juniper\u2019s appointment as chair of Natural England in April was a surprise, not least because the influential environmentalist was joining a beleaguered organisation whose funding has been halved over five years. Conservationist critics have attacked Natural England for licensing the badger cull and pursuing hen harrier \u201cbrood management\u201d whereby chicks of the endangered bird of prey are removed from nests on grouse moors to help the shooting industry thrive. Juniper signalled his discomfort with the badger cull but said it was the watchdog for nature\u2019s statutory duty to license it as the government instructed. He said: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that Natural England would not have advised that a badger cull should be done but the reality is that we\u2019ve been asked to do it and under the framework agreement that we have with Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] we are obliged to take forward that policy.\u201d Critics of Natural England\u2019s \u201chen harrier recovery plan\u201d say it rewards lawbreakers, with hen harriers illegally killed to ensure there are enough red grouse to shoot. Juniper cited research by his agency that revealed tagged hen harriers mostly \u201cdisappeared\u201d on grouse moors \u2013 strong evidence of illegal killing by grouse moor interests. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unequivocal that it is still a problem,\u201d he said. But Juniper also argued that the \u201cbrood management\u201d trial was vital to ensure shooting stakeholders assisted the hen harrier\u2019s recovery. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more chance of convincing those people to come on the journey if they can see that they\u2019ve got part of what they think is the solution for them also on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cMy only benchmark is whether the hen harrier recovers or not. That\u2019s all I\u2019m concerned about.\u201d Juniper said he had not yet been promised any extra resources to help Natural England but he was determined to show that looking after the natural environment was not a cost, but \u201can essential investment in the future of our country\u201d. \u201cWe know that dividend from healthy nature is bigger than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an investment in the nation\u2019s health but also an investment in resilience against climate change, it\u2019s an investment in essential infrastructure in terms of flood protection and water purity and it\u2019s also an investment in long-term food security because in the end all our food comes from nature. \u201cToo often it\u2019s been easy to see the environment as an inconvenience that\u2019s getting in the way of development and progress.

      "bodyText": "Set on the southern tip of stunning Vancouver Island, Victoria may be Vancouver\u2019s smaller sibling in terms of size, but what it lacks in big city hustle is more than made up for by its cultural and historical clout, fantastic bar and dining scene, gorgeous natural surrounds , walkability and local charm. And as with any new city to explore, it is the local side of things that you\u2019ll want to get acquainted with on your visit. So, where do Victorians go for the best cocktail, brunch, day trip or cultural fix? Read on to find out \u2026 What to do Hot tourist spots such as FanTan Alley, the Parliament buildings and Fisherman\u2019s Wharf are not to be missed from any Victoria trip itinerary, but making time for the smaller attractions is also important \u2013 and small is the very essence of the Victoria Bug Zoo, a two-room mini-zoo that will delight (and potentially disgust) visitors of all ages. Housing about 50 species of live tropical bugs to view and experience, the zoo\u2019s friendly and knowledgeable tour guides will have even insectophobes seeing these creepy but fascinating critters in a new light. Butchart Gardens, a sunken garden in a former quarry Speaking of insects, there are sure to be many hanging out at Butchart Gardens. In 1912, Jennie Butchart began transforming the former limestone quarry that made up her back yard into a beautiful sunken garden \u2013 and things escalated. Today, the gardens are a national historic site, span more than 22 hectares and showcase more than 900 types of plant, as well as a carousel, night illuminations, boat tours, firework displays, and an outdoor ice-skating rink in the winter. Whatever the season, this is one attraction worth adding to the itinerary. If you\u2019re in the mood to take in one of the finest views in Victoria, then head to Mount Douglas Park lookout, which offers panoramic views of greater Victoria to the north and west, the Haro Strait to the east and downtown Victoria to the south. Rainy day, or just fancy resting your feet after a long day sightseeing? Mix things up and get your game face on, with a trip to Interactivity Board Game Cafe. It not only sells board games, but also has more than 800 available to sit and enjoy in-house. Slurp one of their homemade milkshakes while you play, or head over to the 19+ side of the store, where there\u2019s craft beer on tap. And for the ultimate R&amp;R break, head to the Oak Bay Beach Hotel\u2019s Boathouse Spa and Baths. Open daily, this slice of heaven features three heated outdoor mineral pools with breathtaking oceanfront views across the Salish Sea. When it comes to places to unwind, it doesn\u2019t get much better than this. The view over the harbour; Interactivity Board Game Cafe Where to eat With more restaurants per capita than almost any other city in Canada, deciding where to eat in Victoria can be almost overwhelming \u2013 but you can\u2019t really go wrong with The Tapa Bar. Friendly service and Spanish- and Mexican-inspired tapas dishes is the name of the game at this charming spot in Victoria\u2019s historic Trounce Alley. Tuck yourself into the warm and inviting interior, or do it alfresco on the small patio \u2013 either is the perfect setting for washing down impeccable patatas bravas with a glass of sangria. If you\u2019re looking for more of a unique dining experience, look no further than the 1888 heritage home turned restaurant, cafe and shop, Nourish Kitchen &amp; Cafe. Sure, it\u2019s overlooking the inner harbour, but this isn\u2019t a place that just relies on location \u2013 the seasonal menu is as fresh as it is delicious. Part and Parcel The same is true of the more casual counter-serve cafe Part and Parcel. Don\u2019t be put off by the slightly underwhelming exterior: exquisitely plated salads, sandwiches and mains, made with locally sourced ingredients, are a delight for the eyes and taste buds \u2013 while the relaxed vibe makes it the perfect sightseeing pit stop. No locals\u2019 favourites list would be complete without mentioning Uchida Eatery. Tiny, busy, and serving lunch only until they sell out (and yes, they do sell out), you\u2019ll have to be quick to enjoy the oh-so-tasty Japanese delights created daily by Uchida\u2019s talented chef. Build your own teishoku from the range of simple but beautifully presented dishes, and experience an authentic taste of Japan. Cold Comfort Ice Cream (top); Uchida Eatery Complete your Victoria dining experience with a treat for your sweet tooth at Cold Comfort Ice Cream. Their \u201ccuriously-flavoured\u201d slogan isn\u2019t just a marketing ploy \u2013 with rotating offerings such as Canadian Breakfast (buttermilk, candied bacon, blueberry pancakes and maple), Christmas Tree (Douglas fir ice-cream, mandarin orange sorbet) and the amazing Best Break-up Ever (every fatty and sugary thing imaginable), this isn\u2019t your average dessert stop. Where to drink Whether you\u2019re after a mid-afternoon aperitif or an evening tipple, the Livet has the benefit of a downtown location but the feeling of a hidden gem, featuring imaginative cocktails, share plates and a buzzy atmosphere (especially when the after-work crowd hits). Grab a seat on the balcony one story up for some open-air delight, then while away the hours sipping, snacking, and people watching. The Livet (top); Little Jumbo Cocktails On the subject of cocktails, speakeasy-inspired joint Little Jumbo Cocktails combines the best of classic and modern mixology, serving craft creations that change every six weeks and are designed to pair perfectly with the small plates menu. One visit and you\u2019ll see why it\u2019s a Victoria locals\u2019 favourite. For caffeine connoisseurs, Discovery Coffee cafe and roastery is a must-visit. With roasting happening daily on-site, brew methods chosen depending on the type of bean, and fresh handmade doughnuts prepared in-house every morning, it\u2019s hardly surprising Discovery now has five locations in the Victoria area. Discovery Coffee Venture a little farther afield (a 30-minute drive or one-hour bus journey from central Victoria) and you\u2019ll find an idyllic spot for a drink, courtesy of the Sea Cider Farm &amp; Ciderhouse, a family owned orchard and ciderhouse that is well worth the trip. Open to the public year-round for tastings, the four-hectare farm is home to 1,300 apple trees, made up of over 50 varieties of heritage apples.

This independent spot hosts local acts and touring bands passing through the city, with an eclectic range of styles including classic rock, jazz, blues, soul, indie, hip-hop and more. Bookworms, meanwhile, will find retail bliss in Munro\u2019s Books, which has enticed readers through its doors since 1963 (doors that now, after a relocation, lead into a magnificent building, formerly a bank).

      "body": "<p>Don\u2019t leave at the interval. The first of this double bill of queer one-act plays by Tennessee Williams is sluggish and shy, leaving you wondering why the King\u2019s Head bothered to revive it. But the second, never performed in Williams\u2019s lifetime because of its overtly gay characters, is a bullet of a show with a shattering lead performance.</p> <p>Something Unspoken, the first play of the night, is a tentative dip into the relationship between wealthy Cornelia (Annabel Leventon) and Grace (Fiona Marr), her meek secretary of 15 years. On Sarah Mercad\u2019s pastel-pink set, the pyjama-clad pair gingerly skirt the topic of romance, all the while interrupted by a repeatedly ringing phone.

      "bodyText": "Don\u2019t leave at the interval. The first of this double bill of queer one-act plays by Tennessee Williams is sluggish and shy, leaving you wondering why the King\u2019s Head bothered to revive it. But the second, never performed in Williams\u2019s lifetime because of its overtly gay characters, is a bullet of a show with a shattering lead performance. Something Unspoken, the first play of the night, is a tentative dip into the relationship between wealthy Cornelia (Annabel Leventon) and Grace (Fiona Marr), her meek secretary of 15 years. On Sarah Mercad\u2019s pastel-pink set, the pyjama-clad pair gingerly skirt the topic of romance, all the while interrupted by a repeatedly ringing phone. Williams cautiously toys with reputation and loyalty, and drops delicate imagery into their language \u2013 Grace compares the way they\u2019ve aged, her hair grey cobwebs to Cornelia\u2019s silver \u2013 but the lyrical allusiveness quickly becomes monotonous.

      "body": "<p>My best friend and I live on opposite sides of London, but we share a hairdresser. Once every two months, she makes the 90-minute journey to my flat and we both have our highlights done by Lesley, the fastest bleaching brush in the west. While she works, we gossip and cackle and unpack every idle thought and silly piece of trivia we\u2019ve forgotten to tell each other during the intervening weeks. Afterwards we preen, we put music on and she goes through my bedroom and tries on my clothes. For a few hours it feels as though we\u2019re teenagers again. Only with much better hair.</p> <p>Increasingly I\u2019m realising it\u2019s these small, informal moments-between-moments that really make a friendship. The getting-readys. The morning-afters. The shall-we-just-stay-ins.</p> <p>Far and away my favourite moment of freshers\u2019 week at university was the night I spent holed up in a halls of residence dorm room watching a DVD of Fawlty Towers, with a group of new friends who, like me, had elected to skip the Crazy Wild West Hoedown happening in the campus bar downstairs. While everyone else cavorted in panic-bought Stetsons to Cotton Eye Joe, we watched Basil being hit unconscious by the falling moose\u2019s head and congratulated ourselves on our choices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bc82f3153cf44cac67da6e0a97f0fb59fea9a838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc82f3153cf44cac67da6e0a97f0fb59fea9a838/105_0_719_719/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren Bravo, second from the right, and friends\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Housemates, pub quiz team and confidantes: Bravo, second from right, with friends</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Bravo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those new friends went on to become my housemates, my pub quiz team, my unofficial counsellors and confidantes. They\u2019re the people with whom I have staged a gleeful fake Christmas every December for the past 12 years, the festivities growing marginally more civilised as our lives have (we eat our turkey dinner around a table now \u2013 not, as in 2009, out of saucepans while sat on the stairs). And when we reminisce, our favourite memories are never the big-ticket items. End of year balls? Fine. Graduation? Cool, I suppose. But the spontaneous kitchen dance parties? Legendary. Likewise the best part of a big night out was rarely the night itself; it was the <a href=\"https://www.greygoose.com/en-gb/cocktails/grey-goose-vodka/bloody-mary.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bloody Marys</a> with brunch the next day, that clink of ice and hit of pepper, as we pieced together everyone\u2019s juicy titbits from the night before like a great big gossip jigsaw.</p> <p>It\u2019s how so many of my most cherished friendships were forged \u2013 not in life-changing experiences, but in leisurely hours spent talking nonsense, howling with laughter at nothing in particular. It\u2019s easy to feel affection for everyone in the dazzle of a Big Life Moment, or the warmth of its afterglow. But it\u2019s on the ordinary days, the rainy days and Mondays, that you find your true ride-or-dies.</p> <p>And that\u2019s especially true as you get older. As people disperse across cities, counties, even countries, and friendship has to be increasingly meted out between the Big Life Moments; the weddings, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/live-victoriously/2019/may/09/jack-whitehall-no-friend-is-so-tenuous-you-shouldnt-throw-a-party-for-them\">birthday drinks</a>, the housewarmings and baby showers. When the casual, everyday chit-chat we used to take for granted gets relegated to WhatsApp groups and Instagram likes, and IRL meet-ups have to be scheduled weeks in advance. Idling away time together becomes a rare luxury, while savouring it becomes all the more important. No longer the easy proximity and empty diaries, which meant you could fill an evening with one magic word: \u201cpub?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/live-victoriously/2019/may/09/jack-whitehall-no-friend-is-so-tenuous-you-shouldnt-throw-a-party-for-them\">Jack Whitehall: \u2018No friend is so tenuous you shouldn\u2019t throw a party for them\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The significant milestones can give you lovely reasons to celebrate, sure \u2013 but they can also pile on the pressure. How many times have you heard happy couples lament that they barely had a chance to exchange more than two words with their friends on their wedding day, before being swept away by a wave of excitable aunts? The hen weekends where you\u2019re so stressed about the logistics of getting everyone from the pottery class to the knicker-making workshop that you forget to have a good time. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/live-victoriously/2019/jul/24/fine-weather-fine-food-insta-brags-why-you-should-entertain-alfresco-this-summer\">dinners</a> where it takes so long to catch up on everyone\u2019s top-line news that you\u2019re still discussing mortgage rates and maternity leave by the time the bill comes. If we rely on the Big Life Moments to bring us together, we risk missing out on the deeper conversations and the daft interludes, both of which can make even the most ordinary of days feel like a special occasion.</p> <p>So it\u2019s important to remember all of the other ways you connect with people \u2013 and the other people you connect with.

      "bodyText": "My best friend and I live on opposite sides of London, but we share a hairdresser. Once every two months, she makes the 90-minute journey to my flat and we both have our highlights done by Lesley, the fastest bleaching brush in the west. While she works, we gossip and cackle and unpack every idle thought and silly piece of trivia we\u2019ve forgotten to tell each other during the intervening weeks. Afterwards we preen, we put music on and she goes through my bedroom and tries on my clothes. For a few hours it feels as though we\u2019re teenagers again. Only with much better hair. Increasingly I\u2019m realising it\u2019s these small, informal moments-between-moments that really make a friendship. The getting-readys. The morning-afters. The shall-we-just-stay-ins. Far and away my favourite moment of freshers\u2019 week at university was the night I spent holed up in a halls of residence dorm room watching a DVD of Fawlty Towers, with a group of new friends who, like me, had elected to skip the Crazy Wild West Hoedown happening in the campus bar downstairs. While everyone else cavorted in panic-bought Stetsons to Cotton Eye Joe, we watched Basil being hit unconscious by the falling moose\u2019s head and congratulated ourselves on our choices. Those new friends went on to become my housemates, my pub quiz team, my unofficial counsellors and confidantes. They\u2019re the people with whom I have staged a gleeful fake Christmas every December for the past 12 years, the festivities growing marginally more civilised as our lives have (we eat our turkey dinner around a table now \u2013 not, as in 2009, out of saucepans while sat on the stairs). And when we reminisce, our favourite memories are never the big-ticket items. End of year balls? Fine. Graduation? Cool, I suppose. But the spontaneous kitchen dance parties? Legendary. Likewise the best part of a big night out was rarely the night itself; it was the Bloody Marys with brunch the next day, that clink of ice and hit of pepper, as we pieced together everyone\u2019s juicy titbits from the night before like a great big gossip jigsaw. It\u2019s how so many of my most cherished friendships were forged \u2013 not in life-changing experiences, but in leisurely hours spent talking nonsense, howling with laughter at nothing in particular. It\u2019s easy to feel affection for everyone in the dazzle of a Big Life Moment, or the warmth of its afterglow. But it\u2019s on the ordinary days, the rainy days and Mondays, that you find your true ride-or-dies. And that\u2019s especially true as you get older. As people disperse across cities, counties, even countries, and friendship has to be increasingly meted out between the Big Life Moments; the weddings, the birthday drinks, the housewarmings and baby showers. When the casual, everyday chit-chat we used to take for granted gets relegated to WhatsApp groups and Instagram likes, and IRL meet-ups have to be scheduled weeks in advance. Idling away time together becomes a rare luxury, while savouring it becomes all the more important. No longer the easy proximity and empty diaries, which meant you could fill an evening with one magic word: \u201cpub?\u201d The significant milestones can give you lovely reasons to celebrate, sure \u2013 but they can also pile on the pressure. How many times have you heard happy couples lament that they barely had a chance to exchange more than two words with their friends on their wedding day, before being swept away by a wave of excitable aunts? The hen weekends where you\u2019re so stressed about the logistics of getting everyone from the pottery class to the knicker-making workshop that you forget to have a good time. The dinners where it takes so long to catch up on everyone\u2019s top-line news that you\u2019re still discussing mortgage rates and maternity leave by the time the bill comes. If we rely on the Big Life Moments to bring us together, we risk missing out on the deeper conversations and the daft interludes, both of which can make even the most ordinary of days feel like a special occasion. So it\u2019s important to remember all of the other ways you connect with people \u2013 and the other people you connect with. Maybe it\u2019s the friend who drags you to their weird evening class once a month, and rewards you with a good cocktail afterwards. The pal who will get up at dawn to drive to a car boot sale, then talk you out of buying a three-foot high stuffed fox (\u201cit\u2019s kitsch!\u201d).

      "body": "<p>In 1975, Nadine Gordimer reflected that \u201cthere are some stories I have gone on writing, again and again, all my life, not so much because the themes are obsessional but because I found other ways to take hold of them\u201d. All of the areas Gordimer\u2019s fiction explores most intently \u2013 South African society, race and the relations between the sexes \u2013 underwent figurative and literal revolutions between 1939, when she published her first story, and her death in 2014. (Her final story collection was published in 2007, her final novel in 2012.) But the connections between her earliest and latest stories are striking, responding as they do to the foreshocks and aftershocks of some of the 20th century\u2019s most dramatic events.</p> <p>Consider her 1947 story Is There Nowhere Else We Can Meet?, which describes a violent encounter between a young white woman and a black man on a lonely country path. From the outset, Gordimer draws our attention to the physical: as she walks, the woman idly runs a twist of pine needles against her thumb, \u201ccatching in gentle resistance as the minute serrations snagged at the skin\u201d. The man\u2019s leg and heel, visible to the woman through his ragged clothing, \u201cshowed the peculiarly dead, powdery black of cold\u201d. When he runs at her, she turns to find him \u201cpanting right into her face\u201d, and they wrestle until she eventually breaks away. The woman\u2019s escape highlights the contrast between the perilous countryside \u2013 \u201cShe ran and ran, stumbling wildly off through the stalks of dead grass, turning over her heels against hard winter tussocks, blundering through trees and bushes\u201d \u2013 and the reassuring security of suburbia: \u201cAnd she was out. She was out on the road. A little way on there were houses, with gardens, postboxes, a child\u2019s swing. A small dog sat at a gate.\u201d It is as if in leaving the path and scaling a fence, she has passed from a nightmare into reassuring wakefulness. But the opposite reading might also be true: the hostile land beyond the fence is real, and the manicured zone it protects nothing more than a dream that, sooner or later, will end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2158baf28f81dd6ce432c5187ad5870a7d899591\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2158baf28f81dd6ce432c5187ad5870a7d899591/0_48_2452_3064/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gordimer, pictured in 1961.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gordimer in 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gallo Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This idea of the South African society Gordimer lived in \u2013 first in the mining town of Springs, later in Johannesburg \u2013 being a countrywide illusion, is one her work often returns to, and which she described in a 1963 essay: \u201cThe \u2018problems\u2019 of my country did not set me writing; on the contrary, it was learning to write that sent me falling, falling through the surface of \u2018the South African way of life\u2019.\u201d The young woman\u2019s encounter with the black man in Is There Nowhere Else We Can Meet? has momentarily torn a hole in this surface.

Gordimer\u2019s narrator glimpses the awfulness of the system of which he is a passive supporter and beneficiary, then pushes the realisation away. At the story\u2019s end he considers the dead man\u2019s father \u2013 who has gone back to Rhodesia without his son but with a suit \u2013 to have done quite well out of the episode.

In the 1950s the population was classified by race, and segregation of urban areas was enforced. But black South Africans could still be union members, and the African National Congress remained a legal party. (Although membership was a contentious matter: Gordimer\u2019s 1959 story <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1960/01/09/something-for-the-time-being\">Something for the Time Being</a> depicts a black political agitator arguing with his white employer about his right to wear an ANC badge.) <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sharpeville-massacre-marked-turning-point-in-south-africas-history/\">These allowances ended with the 1960 Sharpeville massacre</a>, when the police killed 69 protesters and injured 180.

Not all of them are directly political \u2013 she is just as interested in extramarital affairs as John Updike or James Salter (her 1984 story Sins of the Third Age is particularly Salterian), and she also wrote stories about humans pitted against nature, such as The Gentle Art (1960), a vivid piece about a night-time crocodile safari.</p> <p>But her work underwent a tonal shift during the 1960s, and comes to express a more militant point of view in the 1970s and 80s. In 1975 she published Town and Country Lovers, one of her most coldly furious critiques of apartheid. The first section of the story describes a relationship between a white Austrian geologist working for a mining company and a black shop girl. Their affair, movingly described, has a bleak loneliness to it that arises from its prohibition: \u201cOn Sundays she got into his car in the basement garage and they drove to the country and picknicked away up in the Magaliesberg, where there was no one.\u201d Gordimer relates their arrest with stark simplicity, the flat, their haven, seeming to shake with the policemen\u2019s \u201cstrong, unhurried blows\u201d on the door. From this moment the narrative becomes procedural, and the lovers become subjects to be examined:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They were taken to the police station where they were at once separated and in turn led for examination by the district surgeon. The man\u2019s underwear was taken away and examined, as the sheets had been, for signs of his seed \u2026 Her thighs and knees trembled uncontrollably while the doctor looked into her and touched her deep inside with more hard instruments, carrying wafers of gauze.</p> </blockquote> <p>After this come court statements and a newspaper report. \u201cI lived with the white man in his flat,\u201d the woman says. \u201cHe had intercourse with me sometimes. He gave me tablets to prevent me becoming pregnant.\u201d \u201cEven in my own country,\u201d the man tells a reporter, \u201cit\u2019s difficult for a person from a higher class to marry one from a lower class.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/fiction/tessa-hadley-reads-nadine-gordimer\">Tessa Hadley has </a><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/fiction/tessa-hadley-reads-nadine-gordimer\">called these closing words</a> \u201chorrible dead things\u201d, and they are; we have witnessed such intimacy between these lovers that to see them be reduced to strangers again is profoundly sapping. Their story doesn\u2019t build to a climax, but drains away to a grim emptiness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gordimer wrote a lot \u2013 more than 200 stories \u2013 which almost always entails a trade-off in consistency</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second section, about the relationship between Paulus, a white farmer\u2019s son and Thebedi, the daughter of one of the black farmworkers, is an even more menacing portrait of South Africa\u2019s race laws. \u201cThe farm children play together when they are small,\u201d it begins, \u201cbut once the white children go away to school they soon don\u2019t play together any more\u201d. Paulus is aberrant, continuing to show affection to Thebedi; by the time he leaves school they are lovers. She marries another farmworker, but is already pregnant with Paulus\u2019s child. Returning from college, Paulus discovers that Thebedi has a \u201cvery light\u201d baby, with \u201ca quantity of straight, fine floss\u201d on its head. When he murders the child, it\u2019s uncertain whether he does so through fear of discovery or genuine disgust. Most likely it is some hideous combination of the two: the state\u2019s laws promote fear and disgust of the other, even when that other was once beloved. But it is the uncertainty that is Gordimer\u2019s masterstroke.</p> <p>If Town and Country Lovers describes how the South African state could control its inhabitants, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40547641?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\">Something Out There</a> (1984) looks at a different response: violent resistance. Although it is technically a novella, I want to include it here in part because it\u2019s one of the best things Gordimer wrote, and also because she chose it for inclusion in her final volume of selected stories. The contrast between the \u201ctension\u201d described by the narrator of Six Feet of the Country and the South Africa portrayed in Something Out There is stark. In the opening few pages, Mrs Klopper, one of Gordimer\u2019s most acerbic examples of conservative Afrikaner womanhood, explains why she doesn\u2019t have black servants:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t want anyone in my place, I don\u2019t want all that business of having to lock up my sugar and tea \u2013 no, I\u2019ll rather do everything myself. I can\u2019t stand to feel one of them there at my back all the time.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gordimer entwines two storylines: the first is about a wild, humanoid animal (it turns out to be a baboon) that terrorises an affluent Johannesburg neighbourhood. The second is about a revolutionary cell, two of whom are white and two black, who rent a farmhouse outside the city and prepare an attack on a nearby power station. Gordimer exploits the dramatic irony of the white suburbanites\u2019 fear of the creature rampaging in their midst while the real-estate agent and his wife consider the white revolutionaries \u2013 terrorists, they will later call them \u2013 to be upstanding young people, and their black colleagues, who are the key operatives with the technical expertise required to handle explosives, just \u201chouseboys\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7e546a0daaa9ef25f8548b0e04687fe4263d9ec4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e546a0daaa9ef25f8548b0e04687fe4263d9ec4/0_37_1102_1377/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gordimer with Archbishop Desmond Tutu in 1991, just after her Nobel win was announced.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gordimer with Archbishop Desmond Tutu in 1991, just after her Nobel prize was announced.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: taken from picture library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fragmentary structure of Something Out There allows Gordimer to carry out an unusually wide survey of South African society, moving from residents\u2019 association meetings to revolutionary training camps, art galleries to ancient mines, and combines several of Gordimer\u2019s primary modes: the lyrical, the social, the comedic, the political, and, most prominently, the ironic. No matter how briefly they appear, every character is made real. Yet finally it is a national atmosphere that the novella depicts, the atmosphere of a country where the prime minister makes speeches about a \u201ctotal onslaught\u201d, where a husband warns his wife not to chase black thieves because \u201cthey\u2019ll knife you if you catch them\u201d, where terrorists are seeping across the borders with Zimbabwe and Mozambique, and where \u201cwhatever you do, you can\u2019t call yourself safe\u201d.</p> <p>Something Out There marks the end of Gordimer\u2019s most accomplished period, which began with the collection Livingstone\u2019s Companions in 1970, and encompassed the novels The Conservationist, Burger\u2019s Daughter and July\u2019s People. She won the Nobel prize for literature in 1991, and wrote several more novels and story collections in the 1990s and 2000s, but the standard of these books is erratic. In truth, all her story collections are erratic. In the New York Times in 1984, Salman Rushdie called Letter from His Father, a story in Something Out There in which Gordimer imagines a response to Franz Kafka\u2019s famous Letter to His Father, \u201can unmitigated disaster\u201d, and he was right.</p> <p>But the reasons why Gordimer\u2019s talent never flowed evenly through her work are twofold: she wrote a lot \u2013 more than 200 stories \u2013 which almost always entails a trade-off in consistency, and she was always keen to experiment, which means her failures are often noble ones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/20/nadine-gordimer-life-times-review\">Life Times: Stories 1952-2007 by Nadine Gordimer \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The real pity is that, of all the stories Gordimer wrote, only her final two collections remain in print and they are probably the poorest examples of her work. The career-spanning anthology <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/20/nadine-gordimer-life-times-review\">Life Times</a> is the better option, but it would be possible to compile a far superior single volume of her short stories that showed the true scale of her achievement. There is little eagerness for such a project at the moment, however. Gordimer died in 2014, and she is currently in the doldrums many writers enter in the years immediately after death. She has only been mentioned in this paper a handful of times since she died, and Hedley Twidle, a senior lecturer at the University of Cape Town, tells me she is barely read in South Africa today. Her reputation is further hampered by the work she wrote from a black perspective, which were controversial then and remain so now, when the question of who has the right to tell certain stories is such a vexed one. It doesn\u2019t help that these stories, the most prominent being Oral History (1980) and <a href=\"https://granta.com/the-ultimate-safari/\">The Ultimate Safari</a> (1988), are far from her best work.</p> <p>Gordimer said her writing was profoundly influenced by politics. She was defined by a historical moment, the apartheid era, and now it appears she has been trapped by it. She is a relic, and a series of poor reviews for her final books serve as a misleading introduction to her work for readers today. Sometimes even the good ones do her no favours: praising Life Times in the New York Review of Books, Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn singled out the syrupy misfire, Dreaming of the Dead, as one of her best stories, a baffling judgment that could persuade most first-time readers not to bother with the rest. She once noted that to write a short story \u201cis to express from a situation in the exterior or interior world the life-giving drop \u2013 sweat, tear, semen, saliva \u2013 that will spread an intensity on the page; burn a hole in it.\u201d At the moment that intensity can only smoulder, awaiting the readers who will one day fan it back to life.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1975, Nadine Gordimer reflected that \u201cthere are some stories I have gone on writing, again and again, all my life, not so much because the themes are obsessional but because I found other ways to take hold of them\u201d. All of the areas Gordimer\u2019s fiction explores most intently \u2013 South African society, race and the relations between the sexes \u2013 underwent figurative and literal revolutions between 1939, when she published her first story, and her death in 2014. (Her final story collection was published in 2007, her final novel in 2012.) But the connections between her earliest and latest stories are striking, responding as they do to the foreshocks and aftershocks of some of the 20th century\u2019s most dramatic events. Consider her 1947 story Is There Nowhere Else We Can Meet?, which describes a violent encounter between a young white woman and a black man on a lonely country path. From the outset, Gordimer draws our attention to the physical: as she walks, the woman idly runs a twist of pine needles against her thumb, \u201ccatching in gentle resistance as the minute serrations snagged at the skin\u201d. The man\u2019s leg and heel, visible to the woman through his ragged clothing, \u201cshowed the peculiarly dead, powdery black of cold\u201d. When he runs at her, she turns to find him \u201cpanting right into her face\u201d, and they wrestle until she eventually breaks away. The woman\u2019s escape highlights the contrast between the perilous countryside \u2013 \u201cShe ran and ran, stumbling wildly off through the stalks of dead grass, turning over her heels against hard winter tussocks, blundering through trees and bushes\u201d \u2013 and the reassuring security of suburbia: \u201cAnd she was out. She was out on the road. A little way on there were houses, with gardens, postboxes, a child\u2019s swing. A small dog sat at a gate.\u201d It is as if in leaving the path and scaling a fence, she has passed from a nightmare into reassuring wakefulness. But the opposite reading might also be true: the hostile land beyond the fence is real, and the manicured zone it protects nothing more than a dream that, sooner or later, will end. This idea of the South African society Gordimer lived in \u2013 first in the mining town of Springs, later in Johannesburg \u2013 being a countrywide illusion, is one her work often returns to, and which she described in a 1963 essay: \u201cThe \u2018problems\u2019 of my country did not set me writing; on the contrary, it was learning to write that sent me falling, falling through the surface of \u2018the South African way of life\u2019.\u201d The young woman\u2019s encounter with the black man in Is There Nowhere Else We Can Meet? has momentarily torn a hole in this surface. Still reeling, she asks herself why she didn\u2019t simply give the man the money he presumably wanted from her. \u201cWhat did I fight for?\u201d she wonders. This could be a pragmatic response to a dangerous situation, but when read back through Gordimer\u2019s subsequent work, which charted her own development from liberal to radical, and her belief in the necessity of, as she wrote in 1976, \u201ca black majority government elected by unqualified franchise\u201d, it\u2019s possible to detect a more profound yearning in the young woman\u2019s thoughts, a yearning amplified by the story\u2019s title. Once this idea takes root, all the white Africans in Gordimer\u2019s fiction seem to know, whether they admit it or not, that they don\u2019t quite belong. This sense of alien incursion is powerfully communicated by Inkalamu\u2019s Place (1965), in which a UN worker drives out into the country to visit a grand house she knew in her childhood. Inkalamu Williamson lived there, an Englishman who took \u201cnative women\u201d as his wives, and had a brood of children that were \u201call shades of brown and yellow-brown, quite different from Inkalamu and my father and us\u201d. She finds the red mud house in a state of collapse and \u201cblurred with overgrowth\u201d. Yet she can still see it as it was, \u201cthree storeys tall, a sandcastle reproduction of a large, calendar-picture English country house\u201d. The ruined white man\u2019s house, in the final stages of being reclaimed by mango trees and forest plants, feels like something from a story by Conrad, as if the aftermath of some variant of Heart of Darkness or An Outpost of Progress has been stumbled on decades later. It becomes clear, as the narrator brings adult wisdom to bear on her childhood memories, and when she meets one of Inkalamu\u2019s daughters running a nearby store, that Inkalamu took more than he gave. He didn\u2019t properly educate his children or make much provision for them, having sold off most of his land before he died. \u201cI was glad that the Williamsons were rid of their white father, and could live,\u201d the narrator states, although she does not recognise the barriers Inkalamu\u2019s mixed-race children face. (Albeit not necessarily apartheid: the precise setting of Inkalamu\u2019s Place isn\u2019t revealed.) In her 1953 story Six Feet of the Country, narrated by a white man who has moved with his wife to a farm 10 miles outside Johannesburg, we see Gordimer\u2019s growing disdain for liberalism. (\u201cI am a white South African radical,\u201d she told the Times in 1974, \u201cdo not call me a \u2018liberal\u2019.\u201d) This man might mock the \u201clook of insanely inane certainty\u201d exhibited by \u201call who are possessed by the master-race theory\u201d, but his own views prove to be retrograde: In the country, there is a lingering remnant of the pre-transitional stage; our relationship with the blacks is almost feudal. Wrong, I suppose, obsolete, but more comfortable all around. When the brother of Petrus, one his farmworkers, dies on his property, he notifies the authorities because the man had crossed into South Africa from Rhodesia without a permit. When Petrus asks his boss to get the body back so his family can bury him, the narrator becomes enmeshed in a maddening bureaucratic exchange that reveals how little a black body was worth under apartheid. Gordimer\u2019s narrator glimpses the awfulness of the system of which he is a passive supporter and beneficiary, then pushes the realisation away. At the story\u2019s end he considers the dead man\u2019s father \u2013 who has gone back to Rhodesia without his son but with a suit \u2013 to have done quite well out of the episode. Gordimer would reuse this outline in her novel The Conservationist, which won the Booker prize in 1974. \u201cWhen Johannesburg people speak of \u2018tension\u2019,\u201d the narrator of Six Feet of the Country comments, \u201cthey don\u2019t mean hurrying people in crowded streets, the struggle for money, or the general competitive character of city life. They mean the guns under the white men\u2019s pillows and the burglar bars on the white men\u2019s windows. They mean those strange moments on city pavements when a black man won\u2019t stand aside for a white man.\u201d When Gordimer wrote this, the apartheid system was growing more draconian. In the 1950s the population was classified by race, and segregation of urban areas was enforced. But black South Africans could still be union members, and the African National Congress remained a legal party. (Although membership was a contentious matter: Gordimer\u2019s 1959 story Something for the Time Being depicts a black political agitator arguing with his white employer about his right to wear an ANC badge.) These allowances ended with the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, when the police killed 69 protesters and injured 180. After Sharpeville the ANC was banned, and a year later its military wing began a campaign of violence against the South African state. South Africa\u2019s worsening political climate runs like a tidemark through Gordimer\u2019s stories. Not all of them are directly political \u2013 she is just as interested in extramarital affairs as John Updike or James Salter (her 1984 story Sins of the Third Age is particularly Salterian), and she also wrote stories about humans pitted against nature, such as The Gentle Art (1960), a vivid piece about a night-time crocodile safari. But her work underwent a tonal shift during the 1960s, and comes to express a more militant point of view in the 1970s and 80s. In 1975 she published Town and Country Lovers, one of her most coldly furious critiques of apartheid. The first section of the story describes a relationship between a white Austrian geologist working for a mining company and a black shop girl. Their affair, movingly described, has a bleak loneliness to it that arises from its prohibition: \u201cOn Sundays she got into his car in the basement garage and they drove to the country and picknicked away up in the Magaliesberg, where there was no one.\u201d Gordimer relates their arrest with stark simplicity, the flat, their haven, seeming to shake with the policemen\u2019s \u201cstrong, unhurried blows\u201d on the door. From this moment the narrative becomes procedural, and the lovers become subjects to be examined: They were taken to the police station where they were at once separated and in turn led for examination by the district surgeon. The man\u2019s underwear was taken away and examined, as the sheets had been, for signs of his seed \u2026 Her thighs and knees trembled uncontrollably while the doctor looked into her and touched her deep inside with more hard instruments, carrying wafers of gauze. After this come court statements and a newspaper report. \u201cI lived with the white man in his flat,\u201d the woman says. \u201cHe had intercourse with me sometimes. He gave me tablets to prevent me becoming pregnant.\u201d \u201cEven in my own country,\u201d the man tells a reporter, \u201cit\u2019s difficult for a person from a higher class to marry one from a lower class.\u201d Tessa Hadley has called these closing words \u201chorrible dead things\u201d, and they are; we have witnessed such intimacy between these lovers that to see them be reduced to strangers again is profoundly sapping. Their story doesn\u2019t build to a climax, but drains away to a grim emptiness. The second section, about the relationship between Paulus, a white farmer\u2019s son and Thebedi, the daughter of one of the black farmworkers, is an even more menacing portrait of South Africa\u2019s race laws. \u201cThe farm children play together when they are small,\u201d it begins, \u201cbut once the white children go away to school they soon don\u2019t play together any more\u201d. Paulus is aberrant, continuing to show affection to Thebedi; by the time he leaves school they are lovers. She marries another farmworker, but is already pregnant with Paulus\u2019s child. Returning from college, Paulus discovers that Thebedi has a \u201cvery light\u201d baby, with \u201ca quantity of straight, fine floss\u201d on its head. When he murders the child, it\u2019s uncertain whether he does so through fear of discovery or genuine disgust. Most likely it is some hideous combination of the two: the state\u2019s laws promote fear and disgust of the other, even when that other was once beloved. But it is the uncertainty that is Gordimer\u2019s masterstroke. If Town and Country Lovers describes how the South African state could control its inhabitants, Something Out There (1984) looks at a different response: violent resistance. Although it is technically a novella, I want to include it here in part because it\u2019s one of the best things Gordimer wrote, and also because she chose it for inclusion in her final volume of selected stories. The contrast between the \u201ctension\u201d described by the narrator of Six Feet of the Country and the South Africa portrayed in Something Out There is stark. In the opening few pages, Mrs Klopper, one of Gordimer\u2019s most acerbic examples of conservative Afrikaner womanhood, explains why she doesn\u2019t have black servants: I don\u2019t want anyone in my place, I don\u2019t want all that business of having to lock up my sugar and tea \u2013 no, I\u2019ll rather do everything myself. I can\u2019t stand to feel one of them there at my back all the time. Gordimer entwines two storylines: the first is about a wild, humanoid animal (it turns out to be a baboon) that terrorises an affluent Johannesburg neighbourhood. The second is about a revolutionary cell, two of whom are white and two black, who rent a farmhouse outside the city and prepare an attack on a nearby power station. Gordimer exploits the dramatic irony of the white suburbanites\u2019 fear of the creature rampaging in their midst while the real-estate agent and his wife consider the white revolutionaries \u2013 terrorists, they will later call them \u2013 to be upstanding young people, and their black colleagues, who are the key operatives with the technical expertise required to handle explosives, just \u201chouseboys\u201d. The fragmentary structure of Something Out There allows Gordimer to carry out an unusually wide survey of South African society, moving from residents\u2019 association meetings to revolutionary training camps, art galleries to ancient mines, and combines several of Gordimer\u2019s primary modes: the lyrical, the social, the comedic, the political, and, most prominently, the ironic. No matter how briefly they appear, every character is made real. Yet finally it is a national atmosphere that the novella depicts, the atmosphere of a country where the prime minister makes speeches about a \u201ctotal onslaught\u201d, where a husband warns his wife not to chase black thieves because \u201cthey\u2019ll knife you if you catch them\u201d, where terrorists are seeping across the borders with Zimbabwe and Mozambique, and where \u201cwhatever you do, you can\u2019t call yourself safe\u201d. Something Out There marks the end of Gordimer\u2019s most accomplished period, which began with the collection Livingstone\u2019s Companions in 1970, and encompassed the novels The Conservationist, Burger\u2019s Daughter and July\u2019s People. She won the Nobel prize for literature in 1991, and wrote several more novels and story collections in the 1990s and 2000s, but the standard of these books is erratic. In truth, all her story collections are erratic. In the New York Times in 1984, Salman Rushdie called Letter from His Father, a story in Something Out There in which Gordimer imagines a response to Franz Kafka\u2019s famous Letter to His Father, \u201can unmitigated disaster\u201d, and he was right. But the reasons why Gordimer\u2019s talent never flowed evenly through her work are twofold: she wrote a lot \u2013 more than 200 stories \u2013 which almost always entails a trade-off in consistency, and she was always keen to experiment, which means her failures are often noble ones. The real pity is that, of all the stories Gordimer wrote, only her final two collections remain in print and they are probably the poorest examples of her work. The career-spanning anthology Life Times is the better option, but it would be possible to compile a far superior single volume of her short stories that showed the true scale of her achievement. There is little eagerness for such a project at the moment, however. Gordimer died in 2014, and she is currently in the doldrums many writers enter in the years immediately after death. She has only been mentioned in this paper a handful of times since she died, and Hedley Twidle, a senior lecturer at the University of Cape Town, tells me she is barely read in South Africa today. Her reputation is further hampered by the work she wrote from a black perspective, which were controversial then and remain so now, when the question of who has the right to tell certain stories is such a vexed one. It doesn\u2019t help that these stories, the most prominent being Oral History (1980) and The Ultimate Safari (1988), are far from her best work. Gordimer said her writing was profoundly influenced by politics. She was defined by a historical moment, the apartheid era, and now it appears she has been trapped by it. She is a relic, and a series of poor reviews for her final books serve as a misleading introduction to her work for readers today. Sometimes even the good ones do her no favours: praising Life Times in the New York Review of Books, Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn singled out the syrupy misfire, Dreaming of the Dead, as one of her best stories, a baffling judgment that could persuade most first-time readers not to bother with the rest. She once noted that to write a short story \u201cis to express from a situation in the exterior or interior world the life-giving drop \u2013 sweat, tear, semen, saliva \u2013 that will spread an intensity on the page; burn a hole in it.\u201d At the moment that intensity can only smoulder, awaiting the readers who will one day fan it back to life.",

Indefatigable, the king conspired, this time with his former enemies the Scots, to fight a second civil war, in which, again, he was defeated.

None took root. Eventually, after Cromwell\u2019s death in 1658, England\u2019s flirtation with non-monarchical government fizzled out.

Although the Puritan colonies of New England were strongly inclined towards the good old cause of parliament and godly reformation, and paid heed to the requests of London for the capture of Whalley and Goffe, their unobtrusive sympathies were with their fellow Puritans. Indeed Matthew Jenkinson presents a delightful comedy of recalcitrance \u2013 of delayed, incompetent or misdirected pursuit of the regicides on the part of the authorities in New England.</p> <p>Whalley and Goffe, sailing under assumed names, had left England from Gravesend on 14 May 1660, just 11 days before the arrival of Charles II at Dover, and four days before the House of Lords had decreed the seizure of the regicides. They arrived in the Boston area in late July, and were soon feted by the residents of Puritan Cambridge, the location of Harvard College. But at the end of November news reached the colony of Massachusetts that the men were excluded from the Act of Indemnity. It would certainly improve the colony\u2019s awkward relations with the crown were the men to be turned in. The fugitives decided to move south to another Puritan colony at New Haven, in what would become Connecticut. In the spring of 1661 the Masachusetts authorities received a royal mandate for the arrest of Whalley and Goffe, but it was not until May, after some judicious dithering, that Governor Endecott appointed two Boston-based royalists, Thomas Kellond and Thomas Kirke, to track them down.</p> <p>Prevarication and sly protectiveness were the order of the day in New Haven too, and the regicide hunters eventually returned to Boston duped, frustrated and led a merry dance by Deputy Governor William Leete, Whalley and Goffe having been at times no more than two miles away from their pursuers.</p> <p>In 1664 the crown sent commissioners to New England, part of whose subtly worded remit was to investigate the affair of the missing regicides. Charles II himself was now part of the charade of shadow-boxing. Weary of too much bloodshed, he was happy enough to have regicides languish in prison and to \u2018coax\u2019 the loyalty of his subjects in New England, but reluctant to see more executions. Still Whalley and Goffe thought it prudent to move on again, spending the rest of their days around the settlement of Hadley in the back country of Massachusetts, where they were visited by Dixwell, their fellow regicide on the run.</p> <p>In due course, as Jenkinson notes, Whalley and Goffe entered into the folklore of New England, not as regicides, but less pejoratively as \u201cthe Judges\u201d. Yet the deeds of the Roundheads amounted to much more than a colourful ancestral heritage for the peoples of 18th-century New England. English civil war precedents played a significant part in framing debates over the authority of the motherland in the decades leading up to the American revolution. Indeed, in 1765 during the frenzied atmosphere that accompanied the imposition of the Stamp Act on the colonies, the house of Thomas Hutchinson, the loyalist lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts, was ransacked by a patriot mob. Hutchinson, it transpires, had owned the diary of William Goffe. By chance, some entries had been transcribed and were kept elsewhere. The destruction of the diary nonetheless leaves the reader all the more impressed at Jenkinson\u2019s detective work in reconstructing the stories of men on the run.</p> <p><em> </em></p> <p>\u2022<em> Charles I\u2019s Killers in America is published by Oxford (RRP \u00a320).

Yet the deeds of the Roundheads amounted to much more than a colourful ancestral heritage for the peoples of 18th-century New England. English civil war precedents played a significant part in framing debates over the authority of the motherland in the decades leading up to the American revolution. Indeed, in 1765 during the frenzied atmosphere that accompanied the imposition of the Stamp Act on the colonies, the house of Thomas Hutchinson, the loyalist lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts, was ransacked by a patriot mob. Hutchinson, it transpires, had owned the diary of William Goffe. By chance, some entries had been transcribed and were kept elsewhere. The destruction of the diary nonetheless leaves the reader all the more impressed at Jenkinson\u2019s detective work in reconstructing the stories of men on the run. \u2022 Charles I\u2019s Killers in America is published by Oxford (RRP \u00a320).

Progressives emerge triumphant from fiery Detroit debate It was pitched as a battle between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for the leadership of the party\u2019s left wing. Instead, the Democratic presidential debate in Detroit on Tuesday saw the two progressive senators team up to weather fierce attacks from moderate candidates such as Johns Hickenlooper and Delaney, who said Sanders\u2019 signature Medicare for All policy represented \u201cthe creep toward socialism\u201d. Warren responded that Democrats could not win back the White House with \u201csmall ideas and spinelessness\u201d. Key moments. Sabrina Siddiqui rounds up the major takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s debate, while our panel of experts pick their winners. No We Can\u2019t? Bhaskar Sunkara says Sanders and Warren showed up their moderate rivals as the \u201cNo We Can\u2019t\u201d Democrats, while Kate Aronoff argues that it\u2019s high time some of the C-listers crowding the field dropped out. ACLU: 900 child separations since judge ordered curtailment The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) says more than 900 migrant children have been separated from their families at the US-Mexican border since last June, when a judge ordered US immigration authorities to sharply curtail the practice. In a Tuesday court filing, the group said 911 children had been split from their families at the border since the 2018 court order, and that one in five of them were under five years old. \u2018Criminal conduct.\u2019 The judge who issued the 2018 court order said family separation should halt except in limited circumstances, such as a parent\u2019s criminal history. Of the 911 separated children, 678 had parents facing criminal allegations. Pregnant detainees. Under Obama, immigration authorities had a policy of presumption of release for all pregnant women. But in the Trump era more and more pregnant migrants are facing prolonged detention, as Cady Voge reports. Canada fugitives were let go after alcohol checkpoint stop The two teenagers accused of killing three people in remote northern Canada were stopped by authorities at an alcohol search checkpoint in Manitoba last week, but Split Lake First Nations safety officers let them go because the pair had not yet been named as suspects. It is a frustrating revelation amid the manhunt for Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, who are suspected of fatally shooting American Chynna Deese and her Australian boyfriend, Lucas Fowler, along with Leonard Dyck, a Canadian botanist. Long getaway. The teenagers are believed to have driven 3,000km (1,800 miles) from British Columbia \u2013 where the victims were found dead \u2013 to Manitoba, where they crashed their Toyota RAV4 on a gravel road near the town of Gillam, set it alight and vanished. Hong Kong protests continue after rioting charges Several hundred people were involved in tense protests at two police stations in Hong Kong late on Tuesday, as 20 pro-democracy demonstrators appeared in court charged with rioting amid the continuing political crisis in the former British colony. The 20 had been arrested on Sunday during another round of violent clashes with police. The rare charge of rioting can lead to a prison sentence of up to 10 years. Chinese influence. The Trump administration reports a buildup of Chinese forces on the Hong Kong border, while westerners living in Hong Kong are being targeted online by Chinese state media and local lawmakers accusing them of stoking the unrest. Crib sheet The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in more than a decade, a sign that the central bank believes the economy\u2019s long period of growth may be coming to an end. North Korea has fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast, the South Korean military has said, maintaining tensions on the peninsula less than a week after Pyongyang\u2019s previous such test. At least 28 people are dead after their bus hit a Taliban roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Yet UN figures suggest more civilians have been killed in 2019 by Nato and the Afghan government than by the Taliban and other militant groups. A female rhinoceros at San Diego Zoo has given birth to North America\u2019s first southern white rhino calf conceived through artificial insemination, raising hopes that wild rhino populations can be brought back from the brink of extinction. Must-reads Why Ben Lecomte is paddling in plastic The 52-year-old long-distance swimmer Ben Lecomte is freestyling through the Great Pacific Garbage Patch from Hawaii to San Francisco, to better understand how plastic is affecting our oceans. There is no \u201ctrash island\u201d, the Frenchman tells Esha Chhabra, but rather an \u201cunderwater smog of microplastic\u201d.

Today, Nina Lakhani reports from Choluteca in Honduras, where coastal towns will soon be wiped out by rising sea levels.

As she prepares to return to the stage at 86, Clark tells Elle Hunt about stoking controversy with with Harry Belafonte, her friendship with Karen Carpenter \u2013 and a dressing room encounter with the King.

      "bodyText": "George Calombaris has said he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the $7.8m underpayment scandal that has engulfed his restaurant empire, pleading with the public not to \u201cpunish my people\u201d. But as the celebrity chef sought to draw a line under the scandal with an emotional television apology to his current and former staff and a vow to keep his eateries open, at least one former employee expressed scepticism at his \u201cdisingenuous\u201d pledge to be a \u201cvoice for change\u201d in the industry. Calombaris\u2019s reputation has taken a hit after the Fair Work Ombudsman fined his Made Establishment company $200,000 over a failure to pay award rates, penalty rates, casual loadings, overtime and other allowances. In an interview on ABC\u2019s 7.30 program on Wednesday night, Calombaris denied his company had systemically tried to deny people what they were owed. \u201cIt\u2019s called not having the proper infrastructure in the background to make sure that the classifications are being checked and done correctly,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be on top of that, all this stuff, there\u2019s a whole myriad of stuff that needs to be ticked and checked and checked and tripled-checked that weren\u2019t being done. \u201cThere is no excuse for what I did. There is no excuse.\u201d Calombaris said the company had \u201cself-reported\u201d when it discovered the underpayment in 2017. It went on to pay out $2.6m to more than 160 people, but this month a Fair Work Ombudsman investigation put the actual figure at nearly $8m. Asked if he had first become aware of the issue in 2017, he said: \u201cIn 2015 there was a letter that came to us about some issues that we needed to fix in terms of [classifications]. \u201cI\u2019ll own up to that. And assuming that it would all be fixed, that\u2019s when in 2017 we discovered that there was a problem.\u201d Calombaris\u2019s Melbourne-based restaurant empire includes the Hellenic Republic, Gazi and Jimmy Grants. Orlaith Belfrage, a former Hellenic Republic worker and Hospo Voice leader, said she welcomed Calombaris\u2019s mea culpa. But she was unconvinced by a pledge from Calombaris to become a \u201cvoice for change\u201d in the industry. She claimed she had not received the full backpay she believed she was owed from her two years at Hellenic Republic, while Nine newspapers has also reported that two other staff have come forward saying they were also underpaid. \u201cI find it a little bit disingenuous to be apologising before there\u2019s been a full resolution,\u201d Belfrage told Guardian Australia. \u201cThere have been employers that have just been paying people properly from the very beginning of their businesses \u2026 I just think they should be the voice for change and should be supported, not people that have historically made mistakes.\u201d A Made spokeswoman said it had now correctly compensated \u201call known affected former and current employees\u201d. The company has sought to contact former employees \u201cin light of their recent accusations to discuss their concerns\u201d but had not yet heard back, she said. In the interview, Calombaris also discussed the news that he and his two fellow MasterChef hosts were leaving the show. Reports claimed the trio had left after Network Ten refused to grant them large pay increases. Calombaris did not answer when asked if the hosts had asked for pay rises of up to 40%. \u201cWhat I can say is that the sticking point that we got to with MasterChef and with Channel Ten was simply time.\u201d he said. \u201cThe dollars were all signed off.\u201d He also vowed to keep his restaurants open. \u201cDon\u2019t punish my people,\u201d he said. \u201cJust know when you come into one of our restaurants, know when you pay the bill, that \u2026 my people are getting paid and paid correctly.\u201d He said he took \u201cfull responsibility for this\u201d and did not \u201cblame anyone\u201d else. Belfrage said the scandal gave her hope that there would be a move towards improved business models in the hospitality industry. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real reason to personally shame him at all,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it definitely should cause the public to think really think more about this industry and maybe how they can change it.\u201d",

Since the notorious heatwave of 2003 that killed thousands across France, the capital has put in place a heat strategy: cooling areas, a checking system for vulnerable people, shady parks kept open all night.</p> <p>Could these strategies actually work against a predicted record temperature of 42C (107.6F)?

Then I take my fluffy dog for a quick morning walk before the pavement becomes too hot for his paws. It\u2019s pretty hot outside now, but nothing out of the ordinary: I\u2019m mostly cranky and tired from the high temperatures overnight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbc9a67499f5ad11629953327d8358176c097967\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbc9a67499f5ad11629953327d8358176c097967/0_275_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman fans herself inside a metro station in Paris as temperatures rise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman fans herself inside a metro station in Paris as temperatures rise.

According to the Paris heatwave plan, I have a plan to spend <a href=\"https://www.paris.fr/services-et-infos-pratiques/prevention-des-risques-majeurs/les-principaux-risques-majeurs-a-paris/la-canicule-5469\">three hours</a> at low temperatures to avoid adverse health consequences, and I\u2019m prepared with other <a href=\"https://api-site-cdn.paris.fr/images/102074?w=Large\">recommendations</a> of the French health department: I\u2019ve made a personal extreme-heat pack with a spray bottle to mist myself with water, a handheld thermometer and a large bottle of water. I\u2019m ready.</p> <h2><strong>10am, hotel</strong></h2> <p><strong>Temperature outside: </strong>34C<strong><br>Strategy: </strong>spend time in air conditioning</p> <p>The temperature outside my front door has improbably climbed by five degrees in the last hour alone. The city is already uncomfortable: the narrow pavements and heavy traffic make it feel even hotter than 34C. There\u2019s nowhere to hide from the exhaust fumes and the already fierce sun.</p> <p>The official advice is to find air conditioning, so I walk to a nearby hotel. I\u2019m already sweating when I arrive, but as soon as I step into reception my body temperature plunges uncomfortably. I\u2019m also supposed to \u201ceat in sufficient quantities\u201d, which I\u2019m interpreting to mean a buffet spread designed for hungry tourists and involving a lot of cheese. I look around at all the guests. They all passed a blissful night sleeping in 18C. They look refreshed, at ease, unflustered. One woman is wearing a scarf. I hate them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3966e9c9bdcbc20a92b454ad6da3d0f208faaf1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3966e9c9bdcbc20a92b454ad6da3d0f208faaf1e/0_141_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People cool off in the Trocadero fountains across from the Eiffel Tower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People cool off in the Trocadero fountains across from the Eiffel Tower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Rossignol/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>12 noon, 20th arrondissement</h2> <p><strong>Temperature: </strong>38C<strong><br>Strategy: </strong>use the Extrema app to seek out \u2018cool islands\u2019; avoid too much walking</p> <p>If 34C was uncomfortable, 38C is nasty.

The first place it recommends is a library: presumably air-conditioned, unfortunately closed. The next suggestion is a nearby church, the \u00c9glise Saint-Germain-de-Charonne, which is deliciously cool \u2013 but a small mass is being held, and I feel like an intruder, so I pop out to the adjoining cemetery. Here, the heat radiates off the polished gravestones in waves: it\u2019s worse than the street. I drink from a fountain, but the water comes out piping hot. I had heard there was a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=brumisateur+RUE&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj27bTW6NLjAhULuRoKHWCbBb8Q_AUIESgB&amp;biw=1363&amp;bih=564\">water mister</a> nearby, so I set out to find it, but fail. Extrema confirms it was only installed for two days.</p> <p>Tramping around has driven my body temperature straight back up. The health department\u2019s advice is to avoid physical exertion, such as walking long distances. I take the bus to a park.</p> <h2>1pm, Parc des Buttes-Chaumont</h2> <p><strong>Temperature: </strong>41C<strong><br>Strategy: </strong>use a heat map to find green spaces</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"254c8868d812c2e277ae66bc0e40e88624136922\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/254c8868d812c2e277ae66bc0e40e88624136922/0_273_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Families find respite from the harsh sun on the hottest day in Paris at Parc de Buttes-Chaumont\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Families find respite from the harsh sun on the hottest day in Paris at Parc de Buttes-Chaumont.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sara Farid/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve made a huge mistake.

The Buttes-Chaumont is one of the city\u2019s largest parks, with waterfalls, sloping lawns and shady grottoes. Since 2015, it has been open 24 hours a day in summer.

      "bodyText": "Last week, as Paris faced down its hottest day since records began, the city authorities declared their readiness. Since the notorious heatwave of 2003 that killed thousands across France, the capital has put in place a heat strategy: cooling areas, a checking system for vulnerable people, shady parks kept open all night. Could these strategies actually work against a predicted record temperature of 42C (107.6F)? A study released this week shows that the world has never warmed faster than now. By 2050, the average temperature in the hottest month in Paris will rise by six degrees. This heatwave might be the new normal. Now that the heat has eased across Europe, it seems like time for some cool reflection on how effective the official advice actually was. Here\u2019s what happened when I followed it. 9am, home, 20th arrondissement Temperature outside: 29C Strategy: shutter your house, spend three hours at low temperature I wake in a sweat, having managed some fitful sleep with the help of a fan during one of the hottest nights in Paris history. Now it\u2019s time to try to keep my tiny, 100-year-old house as cool as possible. Following the advice of the health department, I close all the shutters. Then I take my fluffy dog for a quick morning walk before the pavement becomes too hot for his paws. It\u2019s pretty hot outside now, but nothing out of the ordinary: I\u2019m mostly cranky and tired from the high temperatures overnight. Back home, the dog gets a big bowl of cold water, and I get ready for my day. According to the Paris heatwave plan, I have a plan to spend three hours at low temperatures to avoid adverse health consequences, and I\u2019m prepared with other recommendations of the French health department: I\u2019ve made a personal extreme-heat pack with a spray bottle to mist myself with water, a handheld thermometer and a large bottle of water. I\u2019m ready. 10am, hotel Temperature outside: 34C Strategy: spend time in air conditioning The temperature outside my front door has improbably climbed by five degrees in the last hour alone. The city is already uncomfortable: the narrow pavements and heavy traffic make it feel even hotter than 34C. There\u2019s nowhere to hide from the exhaust fumes and the already fierce sun. The official advice is to find air conditioning, so I walk to a nearby hotel. I\u2019m already sweating when I arrive, but as soon as I step into reception my body temperature plunges uncomfortably. I\u2019m also supposed to \u201ceat in sufficient quantities\u201d, which I\u2019m interpreting to mean a buffet spread designed for hungry tourists and involving a lot of cheese. I look around at all the guests. They all passed a blissful night sleeping in 18C. They look refreshed, at ease, unflustered. One woman is wearing a scarf. I hate them. 12 noon, 20th arrondissement Temperature: 38C Strategy: use the Extrema app to seek out \u2018cool islands\u2019; avoid too much walking If 34C was uncomfortable, 38C is nasty. As the heat rises from the bitumen, I fire up the city\u2019s dedicated heatwave app, Extrema, which identifies 922 \u201cislands of cool\u201d. The first place it recommends is a library: presumably air-conditioned, unfortunately closed. The next suggestion is a nearby church, the \u00c9glise Saint-Germain-de-Charonne, which is deliciously cool \u2013 but a small mass is being held, and I feel like an intruder, so I pop out to the adjoining cemetery. Here, the heat radiates off the polished gravestones in waves: it\u2019s worse than the street. I drink from a fountain, but the water comes out piping hot. I had heard there was a water mister nearby, so I set out to find it, but fail. Extrema confirms it was only installed for two days. Tramping around has driven my body temperature straight back up. The health department\u2019s advice is to avoid physical exertion, such as walking long distances. I take the bus to a park. 1pm, Parc des Buttes-Chaumont Temperature: 41C Strategy: use a heat map to find green spaces I\u2019ve made a huge mistake. The bus is stifling, airless. My handheld thermometer has maxed out at 43C. I see pedestrians in the burning sunlight and I am jealous of them. Much of the transport system in Paris can be rendered unusable during heatwaves, with metro lines also regularly reaching dangerous temperatures. But 65% of Parisians do not own a car and have little option other than to endure it. I start to regret every decision I have made in life that led me to this bus. Collapsing out at the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, I expect some relief, but temperatures outside have now officially broken the previous record, from 1947, of 40.4C. The Buttes-Chaumont is one of the city\u2019s largest parks, with waterfalls, sloping lawns and shady grottoes. Since 2015, it has been open 24 hours a day in summer. Over half of it is covered with more than 100 enormous old trees, making it one of the coolest places in Paris, according to the heat map. But 41C is 41C. There\u2019s an eerie hush as small family groups and the odd shirtless or bikini-clad individual take refuge in the shade. 2pm, 19th arrondissement town hall Temperature: 42C Strategy: use town hall \u2018refreshment rooms\u2019; check in on loved ones After the 2003 heatwave, Paris set up the Chalex service, which allows vulnerable people to receive telephone check-ups during extreme heat. The worst sufferers can be brought to a refreshment room at their local town hall. In the 19th arrondissement, that\u2019s an air-conditioned meeting room: it\u2019s cool enough inside, but the portable air-conditioner is beginning to struggle against 42C. Emerging again into the blasting heat, I follow another of the health department\u2019s rules: check in on your loved ones. In my case, that means texting my partner to ask how the dog is doing. The dog is lying in front of a fan, his fur gently ruffling. The dog is doing much better than me. I\u2019m still radiating heat, primarily it seems from my face. But I\u2019m also lucky that my loved ones are a young man and a resilient street dog. Elderly relatives, or people with reduced mobility who can\u2019t necessarily make it to cooler spaces on their own, need human connection even more urgently in heat crises. 3pm, 18th arrondissement Temperature: 42C Advice: help the vulnerable In any city, heatwaves are hardest for those who lack shelter. For the hottest part of the day, I join a walking group of city officials and volunteers seeking out women who are living on the streets. The group provides hygiene kits and offers to take the women to cooler spaces. Leading the charge is Dominique Versini, one of the city\u2019s deputy mayors. Versini says the heatwave presents serious problems for all homeless people, but particularly women, who are \u201cin twice as much danger\u201d. Exposed to high levels of violence on the streets and often dealing with trauma, she says, many are afraid to access services such as refreshment rooms and public baths where they could cool off. The temperature hits its all-time maximum: 42.6C. The 18th is one of the densest parts of the city, and the photographer and I are struggling. My body is burning up, and now my anxiety is also rising sharply. I know this heatwave has almost certainly been caused by the human-created climate crisis. Greenhouse emissions are on track to reach a record high. I know I will live, best case, to see these problems get much worse. I feel a kind of existential dread. My muscles are starting to get sore. We duck into a supermarket and I end up caressing my face with a range of chilled goods. Orange juice is pretty good but a glass jar of foie gras works best. 5pm, Bassin de la Villette Temperature: 42.6C Advice: swim in the canal On a normal day, I harbour no desire to jump into the Bassin de la Villette. I have seen the bikes, shopping trolleys and electric scooters being fished out of there, coated in muck. There are rumours of a crocodile. But the outdoor pool alongside it, which is full of filtered canal water, has been in use since 2017 as part of a plan by the mayor, Anne Hidalgo, to make public waterways such as the Seine swimmable in time for the 2024 Olympics. Anyway, at this stage I would happily leap into a Siberian toxic dump-lake if I thought it would cool me down. Unfortunately there\u2019s a monstrous queue to get in, leaving would-be bathers baking along the pavement. Some have given up and are diving into the open canal. Everyone seems fine with this. I eventually make it to the pool, and lower myself with a sound I didn\u2019t know I was capable of: something between a whimper of fear and a groan of satisfaction. The water is a toasty 25.5C, and oddly slimy, but swimming feels incredible. I\u2019m smiling for the first time in more than 24 hours. I try to avoid thinking about how much canal water I\u2019m ingesting, and that E coli scare from a couple of years ago. 6pm, Place de la Bataille de Stalingrad Temperature: 41C Advice: douse yourself in cold water The effects of the pool wear off more or less as soon as I get out of the water and cross a bridge over the canal in full sun.

      "body": "<p>Amid the global rise of rightwing populism, \u201cfascist\u201d has become a common \u2013 indeed over-used \u2013 epithet. The F-word is convenient for critics of the new wave of populism, seeking as it does to tie their opponents to historical movements which nearly all of mainstream society regards as deplorable. But the word is convenient for the right too, allowing them to wave away their critics as overwrought and deranged while avoiding serious discussion of the substance of their policies and rhetoric.</p> <p>Even the Trumpified Republican party is not a fascist movement and Trump is certainly no Hitler. Full-blown fascism usually emerges under the pressure of economic collapse or existential war, but it is constructed from pre-existing social and political raw materials. But while the Trump era hasn\u2019t seen the rise of a true fascism in the United States, it has given us sharp and painful insights into the raw materials out of which a future American fascism might be constructed.</p> <p>Any fascism of the future will be different from that of the 20th century. But it will have to share features with its forebears, including ultranationalism, illiberalism, a strong impulse to regiment society, and the forcible suppression of opposition. This fascism would, in other words, cut against what most Americans still recognize \u2013 even if only to give lip service to \u2013 as the core values of their nation.</p> <p>Yet Trump\u2019s persistent hold on his base shows how a coalition against characteristically American values may be constructed and used to hold power, even if the coalition represents only a minority of the country. In particular, Trump appeals to two overlapping groups \u2013 white evangelicals and white voters motivated primarily by opposition to racial and cultural change \u2013 who each have their own reasons to embrace illiberalism and endorse the power of an illiberal state being used against their enemies.</p> <p>What these groups share is a belief that their very existence is threatened. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/11/trump-administration-evangelical-influence-support\">Evangelical Christian support for Trump</a> is often motivated by the fear that secular liberals are seeking to crush Christianity and banish it from the land. Such a fear lends itself to support for an authoritarian who will crush the opposition before it gets a chance to strike first.

      "bodyText": "Amid the global rise of rightwing populism, \u201cfascist\u201d has become a common \u2013 indeed over-used \u2013 epithet. The F-word is convenient for critics of the new wave of populism, seeking as it does to tie their opponents to historical movements which nearly all of mainstream society regards as deplorable. But the word is convenient for the right too, allowing them to wave away their critics as overwrought and deranged while avoiding serious discussion of the substance of their policies and rhetoric. Even the Trumpified Republican party is not a fascist movement and Trump is certainly no Hitler. Full-blown fascism usually emerges under the pressure of economic collapse or existential war, but it is constructed from pre-existing social and political raw materials. But while the Trump era hasn\u2019t seen the rise of a true fascism in the United States, it has given us sharp and painful insights into the raw materials out of which a future American fascism might be constructed. Any fascism of the future will be different from that of the 20th century. But it will have to share features with its forebears, including ultranationalism, illiberalism, a strong impulse to regiment society, and the forcible suppression of opposition. This fascism would, in other words, cut against what most Americans still recognize \u2013 even if only to give lip service to \u2013 as the core values of their nation. Yet Trump\u2019s persistent hold on his base shows how a coalition against characteristically American values may be constructed and used to hold power, even if the coalition represents only a minority of the country. In particular, Trump appeals to two overlapping groups \u2013 white evangelicals and white voters motivated primarily by opposition to racial and cultural change \u2013 who each have their own reasons to embrace illiberalism and endorse the power of an illiberal state being used against their enemies. What these groups share is a belief that their very existence is threatened. Evangelical Christian support for Trump is often motivated by the fear that secular liberals are seeking to crush Christianity and banish it from the land. Such a fear lends itself to support for an authoritarian who will crush the opposition before it gets a chance to strike first. Trump has shown that evangelicals will support anyone who even pretends to care about their motivating issues \u2013 abortion, Jerusalem, religious freedom \u2013 regardless of his obvious repugnance by any normal understanding of Christian values. This ideology\u2019s beating heart will be a white nationalism motivated by a belief that the \u201ctrue\u201d (read: white) America is under siege from a combination of racial minorities and liberal elites. This conspiratorial worldview likewise lends itself to a support for using state power against these enemies of the people.

I was worried that whatever I talked about would be shared with the school and I didn\u2019t want that, because I was ashamed of my situation,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, after three months, the life coach began getting through to me and she broke it down, showing me the negative things I was doing and where it would lead me, compared with the positives I could gain if I just made different life choices.\u201d These included continuing his education. \u201cLittle successes like finishing college were massive in building my confidence. She also made me realise that I didn\u2019t need social media; I didn\u2019t need to keep comparing myself with other people and searching for approval,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Hailey Yatros, a 26-year-old life coach, says the internet is a key reason why young people are seeking coaching. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/21/generation-z-has-different-attitudes-says-a-new-report\" title=\"\">This generation leans on social media</a> as their means of connection to other people and they don\u2019t really have anything else,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of them get a coach to not be alone. I had a client once who had over 7,000 followers on Instagram and she didn\u2019t have anyone in her life she could confide in if she needed to.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most common questions Yatros receives from clients is what their purpose in life should be. \u201cI laugh when young people come to me asking how they should live their lives, because you\u2019re not meant to know that when you\u2019re in your teens,\u201d she says. \u201cYour life purpose is meant to evolve over time and that question should be asked more than once.

They forget they\u2019re playing a long game.\u201d</p> <p>Yatros is one of a new generation of life coaches in their 20s who approach their young clients with a deeper understanding of the issues they face, since they have similar concerns. Coaching is unregulated, so anyone could call themselves a coach, although Yatros took a qualification through a <a href=\"https://www.dalecarnegie.com/en-gb\" title=\"\">Dale Carnegie training course</a> at 19. \u201cWhen I started, I had clients who were in their 40s, but age has nothing to do with it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about your experiences and what you\u2019ve learned.

Allison Rosengard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Life coaching is not to be confused with therapy. \u201cYou go to therapy because something is broken and you want it to be fixed,\u201d says the life coach Michael Bungay Stanier, \u201cwhereas in coaching we have the philosophy that you\u2019re resourceful, creative and whole and it\u2019s about amplifying what\u2019s working now. Coaching is often short-term \u2013 six to 12 months \u2013 and very positive and goal-oriented, whereas therapy can move much slower and much deeper.\u201d Counselling and therapy qualifications are also more widespread than life coaching, with services accessible via the NHS in the UK \u2013 a provision that does not extend to coaching.</p> <p>Bungay Stanier is 51 and has been coaching for more than 20 years. He thinks the increase in interest among young people is not only down to the anxieties and loneliness wrought by social media, but also because the idea of actively pursuing a career has been destigmatised. \u201cWhen I started, people would get a coach because they were a bit messed up or were struggling,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now coaching is seen as a helpful space to figure stuff out \u2013 it\u2019s almost a badge of honour to show people you\u2019re committed to getting the best out of your life.\u201d He also credits its popularity to a greater sense of questioning among young people. \u201cWhen I was growing up, it was all about buckling down and working the system. Millennials, though, don\u2019t want to put up with the bullshit or jump through hoops; they\u2019re always asking themselves: \u2018What do I want?\u2019 which is a profound and really difficult question.\u201d Coaching can offer them different perspectives, he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd289dc04b73b0f66559a4d509bf7e9c743cdc23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd289dc04b73b0f66559a4d509bf7e9c743cdc23/0_0_3200_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Bungay Stanier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Coaching is almost a badge of honour to show people you\u2019re committed to getting the best out of your life\u2019 ...

I didn\u2019t have much direction,\u201d she says. \u201cLife coaching felt like a safety blanket, connecting with someone who had been there only five or 10 years before me, with similar experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Rosengard\u2019s coach was Kali Rogers, the 31-year-old founder of <a href=\"https://joinblush.com/\" title=\"\">Blush, a </a><a href=\"https://joinblush.com/\" title=\"\">service aimed at </a><a href=\"https://joinblush.com/\" title=\"\">young women</a>. \u201cWomen need a safe space,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cSo, it was important for me to build a platform where they wouldn\u2019t feel judged.\u201d Rogers was also kicking against the stereotypes. \u201cPeople think that life coaching is just for middle-aged men; when I started, all I could find was male executive coaches. I wanted to break the stigma and show that you don\u2019t have to be a man making a million dollars a year, sitting in a corner office, to have this luxury. You can be a 22-year-old woman at her first job and thinking: \u2018Is this my life?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Rosengard has been seeing Rogers for five years. \u201cA good coach is a mentor in all things \u2013 they show you how to be an adult,\u201d Rosengard says. \u201cInitially, I would get a lot of questions from people asking whether I was seeing a therapist and why I needed it, but there\u2019s a greater awareness now. As self-care becomes more popular, the surprised reaction to having a life coach has gone away.\u201d Rosengard\u2019s work with Rogers has led her into a career as a management consultant.</p> <p>Increasingly, young people are choosing life coaching itself as their profession. \u201cThe career is growing rapidly,\u201d says Magdalena Mook, the CEO of the ICF. \u201cWe have 900 new members joining each year, with many Gen Zs training. They will be the future of the profession, as they really see it as a viable career choice.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve grown up with technology and distractions \u2013 we almost have to learn how to look someone in the eye</p> <footer> <cite>Gabby Carpenter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harry Langdon, 26, is based in Jersey and has been practising for three years. \u201cI became obsessed with personal development and enabling people to get the best out of themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cCoaching seemed like the only career choice that would add a sense of purpose to my life. I knew I could connect well with younger people and that they would trust me, because I\u2019m a millennial myself. The demand has been huge.\u201d</p> <p>With prices ranging from \u00a345 a session to <a href=\"https://www.nickhatter.com/prices\" title=\"\">\u00a3500 and above</a>, it is cost rather than any stigma that seems the biggest barrier to accessing a coach. Gabby Carpenter, 19, hired a coach two years ago, when she was applying to get into university. \u201cI had to use all the money I was making in my summer job to afford the sessions, but I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend it to my peers,\u201d she says. \u201cIt might seem a bit woo-woo, but that investment gave me the confidence and structure to get into medical school and will pay off for the rest of my career. It sets you up for life.\u201d Carpenter also believes that the skills she learned through coaching will help her as a doctor. \u201cCoaching teaches you how to communicate properly and how to prioritise different aspects of your life, which is something that we Gen Zs have struggled with,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown up with technology and distractions \u2013 we almost have to learn how to look someone in the eye.\u201d</p> <p>With a new branch of his recruitment company having just opened in Manchester, Dixon plans to continue seeing his own life coach. \u201cYou end up building a really close mentor-like relationship,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s really helped me get that balance between ambition, purpose and life. Young people just need to slow down; once we do, we finally have the space to figure out what we\u2019re good at. From there, we can build much better, more considered lives.\u201d</p>",

I had a client once who had over 7,000 followers on Instagram and she didn\u2019t have anyone in her life she could confide in if she needed to.\u201d One of the most common questions Yatros receives from clients is what their purpose in life should be. \u201cI laugh when young people come to me asking how they should live their lives, because you\u2019re not meant to know that when you\u2019re in your teens,\u201d she says. \u201cYour life purpose is meant to evolve over time and that question should be asked more than once. Lots of young people feel that, if they don\u2019t get what they want right now, they\u2019ll never get it. They forget they\u2019re playing a long game.\u201d Yatros is one of a new generation of life coaches in their 20s who approach their young clients with a deeper understanding of the issues they face, since they have similar concerns. Coaching is unregulated, so anyone could call themselves a coach, although Yatros took a qualification through a Dale Carnegie training course at 19. \u201cWhen I started, I had clients who were in their 40s, but age has nothing to do with it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about your experiences and what you\u2019ve learned. My clients didn\u2019t care how old I was, because we live in a society where people are so thirsty for help: if you can help them, they\u2019ll absolutely take it.\u201d Life coaching is not to be confused with therapy. \u201cYou go to therapy because something is broken and you want it to be fixed,\u201d says the life coach Michael Bungay Stanier, \u201cwhereas in coaching we have the philosophy that you\u2019re resourceful, creative and whole and it\u2019s about amplifying what\u2019s working now. Coaching is often short-term \u2013 six to 12 months \u2013 and very positive and goal-oriented, whereas therapy can move much slower and much deeper.\u201d Counselling and therapy qualifications are also more widespread than life coaching, with services accessible via the NHS in the UK \u2013 a provision that does not extend to coaching. Bungay Stanier is 51 and has been coaching for more than 20 years. He thinks the increase in interest among young people is not only down to the anxieties and loneliness wrought by social media, but also because the idea of actively pursuing a career has been destigmatised. \u201cWhen I started, people would get a coach because they were a bit messed up or were struggling,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now coaching is seen as a helpful space to figure stuff out \u2013 it\u2019s almost a badge of honour to show people you\u2019re committed to getting the best out of your life.\u201d He also credits its popularity to a greater sense of questioning among young people. \u201cWhen I was growing up, it was all about buckling down and working the system. Millennials, though, don\u2019t want to put up with the bullshit or jump through hoops; they\u2019re always asking themselves: \u2018What do I want?\u2019 which is a profound and really difficult question.\u201d Coaching can offer them different perspectives, he says. One year into college, Allison Rosengard, 21, who lives in Boston in the US, found herself asking what her life\u2019s purpose would be. \u201cI was anxious at the time, because my whole childhood was geared up towards getting to college, then once you\u2019re there you\u2019re totally alone. I didn\u2019t have much direction,\u201d she says. \u201cLife coaching felt like a safety blanket, connecting with someone who had been there only five or 10 years before me, with similar experiences.\u201d Rosengard\u2019s coach was Kali Rogers, the 31-year-old founder of Blush, a service aimed at young women. \u201cWomen need a safe space,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cSo, it was important for me to build a platform where they wouldn\u2019t feel judged.\u201d Rogers was also kicking against the stereotypes. \u201cPeople think that life coaching is just for middle-aged men; when I started, all I could find was male executive coaches. I wanted to break the stigma and show that you don\u2019t have to be a man making a million dollars a year, sitting in a corner office, to have this luxury. You can be a 22-year-old woman at her first job and thinking: \u2018Is this my life?\u2019\u201d Rosengard has been seeing Rogers for five years. \u201cA good coach is a mentor in all things \u2013 they show you how to be an adult,\u201d Rosengard says. \u201cInitially, I would get a lot of questions from people asking whether I was seeing a therapist and why I needed it, but there\u2019s a greater awareness now. As self-care becomes more popular, the surprised reaction to having a life coach has gone away.\u201d Rosengard\u2019s work with Rogers has led her into a career as a management consultant. Increasingly, young people are choosing life coaching itself as their profession. \u201cThe career is growing rapidly,\u201d says Magdalena Mook, the CEO of the ICF. \u201cWe have 900 new members joining each year, with many Gen Zs training. They will be the future of the profession, as they really see it as a viable career choice.\u201d Harry Langdon, 26, is based in Jersey and has been practising for three years. \u201cI became obsessed with personal development and enabling people to get the best out of themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cCoaching seemed like the only career choice that would add a sense of purpose to my life. I knew I could connect well with younger people and that they would trust me, because I\u2019m a millennial myself. The demand has been huge.\u201d With prices ranging from \u00a345 a session to \u00a3500 and above, it is cost rather than any stigma that seems the biggest barrier to accessing a coach. Gabby Carpenter, 19, hired a coach two years ago, when she was applying to get into university. \u201cI had to use all the money I was making in my summer job to afford the sessions, but I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend it to my peers,\u201d she says. \u201cIt might seem a bit woo-woo, but that investment gave me the confidence and structure to get into medical school and will pay off for the rest of my career. It sets you up for life.\u201d Carpenter also believes that the skills she learned through coaching will help her as a doctor. \u201cCoaching teaches you how to communicate properly and how to prioritise different aspects of your life, which is something that we Gen Zs have struggled with,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown up with technology and distractions \u2013 we almost have to learn how to look someone in the eye.\u201d With a new branch of his recruitment company having just opened in Manchester, Dixon plans to continue seeing his own life coach. \u201cYou end up building a really close mentor-like relationship,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s really helped me get that balance between ambition, purpose and life. Young people just need to slow down; once we do, we finally have the space to figure out what we\u2019re good at. From there, we can build much better, more considered lives.\u201d",

Encouraged to go to the Netherlands to repair a bad-boy image, he impressed for Eredivisie side Willem II last season. Crowley, who started at Aston Villa before leaving for north London as a 15-year-old, returns to the Midlands with something of a point to prove after unsuccessful loan spells in League One at Barnsley and Oxford. Steven Sessegnon, Fulham His twin brother, Ryan, needs little introduction but this season could be the chance for Steven to make a similar splash. The 19-year-old, who operates at right-back, is also of considerable interest to Tottenham despite the fact he is yet to make his league debut. Part of the England Under-17 team that won the World Cup two years ago, he featured for the Under-20s this summer. Will battle with Cyrus Christie for a starting berth if he stays. Sammie Szmodics, Bristol City Last season was his most productive, scoring 15 goals for Colchester, whom he joined aged seven before making his debut six years ago. The 23-year-old attacking midfielder possesses plenty of verve and has whetted supporters\u2019 appetite with a delicious lob in pre-season. Could prove a snip at \u00a3750,000 and has all the tools to be a fans\u2019 favourite. Another former Colchester player, Macauley Bonne, could shine at Charlton.",

Lambie made the threat during a show of unity by parliamentary crossbenchers on Wednesday about the necessity for stronger accountability measures in response to allegations aired by Nine this week against the casino operator Crown Resorts. On Wednesday the Age reported that the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission will conduct a special investigation into organised crime in Australian casinos. The ACIC\u2019s targeting criminal wealth special investigation will reportedly probe the operation of agents known as junkets who are responsible for bringing high roller clients into casinos, usually from offshore. The government has already referred the allegations aired about Crown to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. ACIC chief, Michael Phelan, reportedly said the \u201cinfrastructure supporting junket operations \u2026 provides opportunities for exploitation by serious and organised crime to conceal and legitimise criminal wealth\u201d. \u201cThe structure of junket operations enables opaqueness around the source of beneficial ownership of funds \u2026 and represents a significant money laundering risk.\u201d Phelan did not name which operators were being examined. On Wednesday Crown issued public advertisements boasting that it has \u201ca comprehensive anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing program\u201d and \u201crobust process\u201d for vetting junket operators through a combination of probity, integrity and police checks. In the ads the Crown board states that junket operators are \u201cnot Crown\u2019s\u201d but rather \u201cindependent operators who arrange for their customers to visit many casinos globally\u201d. In addition to making a public threat about potentially withholding legislative support, Lambie also urged would-be whistleblowers to bring fresh material to non-aligned parliamentarians. \u201cWe have no fear and we have the advantage of privilege in the chamber,\u201d the Tasmanian senator said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got documents you want to produce to us and you don\u2019t want to be named, I tell you what we have no fear in standing up in the chamber and calling them out for what is going on here.\u201d The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick told reporters there was \u201cno question\u201d the crossbench would seek changes to the Morrison government\u2019s bill to establish a federal anti-corruption commission to give it \u201cproper jurisdiction and powers\u201d. Lambie said the Centre Alliance had already drawn up an alternative bill, which had been sent to drafters and will be presented when parliament resumes in five weeks after the winter recess. \u201cObviously I want it to have more teeth than Jaws,\u201d she said. Under the government\u2019s proposal, the ALCEI will be converted into an anti-corruption commission \u2013 a model that has been criticised by some experts. On Tuesday, the independent lower house MP Andrew Wilkie was unsuccessful in his efforts to move a motion establishing a joint parliamentary committee to examine Crown. The attorney general, Christian Porter, instead asked the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to investigate. Porter said it was \u201cthe most appropriate body to consider these allegations\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Wilkie, who blasted Tuesday\u2019s referral, said the Australian public would not accept the \u201cweak integrity commission that has been proposed by the current government\u201d. \u201cThe public want something with teeth. And the public want to know what politicians in this place are trying to hide \u2013 because that\u2019s the only reason you\u2019d oppose an integrity commission.\u201d Wilkie noted the Nine investigation into Crown casino had included claims that two ministers and an MP had lobbied the home affairs department to facilitate entry of VIPs and high-roller gamblers to Australia by private jet. The Greens MP Adam Bandt said while this conduct may not constitute a crime, it could possibly constitute corruption. Lambie declared there were \u201cmorally corrupt\u201d politicians in the parliament. Wilkie said the government\u2019s Australian Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity inquiry was a \u201csnow job\u201d that was only \u201cgood as far as it goes\u201d but could not directly investigate employees of Crown and other government agencies, such as the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation. In a statement on Tuesday, Crown said it \u201cabsolutely rejects allegations of illegality made in parliament today and in recent media reporting\u201d and that it would assist the ACLEI investigation.",

He cut his coaching teeth with Keighley and, after returning to Australia, rose to prominence by steering Northern Pride to Queensland Cup glory. That earned him a stint as Wayne Bennett's number two at Brisbane and he followed the England boss to South Sydney.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Richard Marshall&nbsp;</b><br>Marshall is technically already in position, having succeeded Sean Long as assistant to Justin Holbrook six weeks ago. The 43-year-old was a useful back-row forward in his playing days with Halifax, Huddersfield and London Broncos and had his coaching apprenticeship under Tony Smith at Warrington. He was head coach for four and a half years at Halifax, where he ensured the part-time Championship club were top-four contenders every year until his surprise sacking in April.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Ian Watson&nbsp;</b><br>Watson was a Welsh international scrum-half who gave splendid service to Salford, Rochdale, Halifax, Swinton, Oldham, Leigh and Widnes before carving out a successful coaching career. He began at Swinton before teaming up with his old Wales boss Iestyn Harris at Salford, where he stepped up as head coach in 2016. Constantly working on a tight budget and with a series of off-field issues that would have tested more experienced men, Watson continued to defy all expectations by turning the Red Devils into play-off contenders and his stature was recognised by his addition to the Great Britain backroom team.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Shaun Wane&nbsp;</b><br>It would rank as one of the more unlikely appointments since Wane spent nearly four decades as player, scout and coach at arch rivals Wigan but it cannot be ruled out. Wane, 54, left his home-town club at the end of the 2018 season, shortly after guiding them to a third Grand Final triumph, to take up the part-time role of high-performance coach with the Scottish Rugby Union. But he remains a rugby league man and expressed an interest in the Leeds vacancy earlier in the year. <b>PA Media</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

A plethora of different nationalities and identities have pulled up a chair and, here at Sehaq in Amsterdam, they welcome and make space for everyone. Suddenly, someone is standing on the table dancing, and as more people join in, the meal becomes an exuberant celebration. Some of them have travelled for more than two hours to attend and they don\u2019t want to waste a single second if they have to leave early. For those who can stay, after the meal there will be performances, DJs and partying until late into the night. Most of the people here are LGBT refugees, and this event is one of the few that provides a safe space to socialise and collaborate.

We punish people for being poor, because there seems to be some deep-rooted sense that poverty is a choice. It\u2019s not and never has been. It\u2019s circumstance. It\u2019s existing within systems which are set up by those already privileged enough to access the opportunities. It is not and never has been as easy as \u2018having a go\u2019.

This is a serious matter for the integrity of Australia.</p> <p>I stand in support of my colleagues Senator Wong and Senator Keneally in expressing concern about this conference, CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference, and about the standards that our leaders, particularly the Prime Minister, need to make clear when it comes to the participation of leaders from this place and other places.</p> <p>In the US, CPAC is an annual political conference attended by conservative activists and elected officials from across the United States. CPAC is hosted by the American Conservative Union. Now we have CPAC down under, with a conference in Sydney from 9 to 11 August.</p> <p>What\u2019s this about? Is this a sign that our fierce Australian characteristics of independent thinking are finally capitulating to rejected offerings from overseas?</p> <p>There was a time when we were concerned about how our national discourse was informed. Now it looks like we\u2019re submitting to poisonous ideas without reflection. You can buy a Reagan VIP Freedom Pass to the conference for $599. No one from Newstart will be there; that\u2019s more than their fortnightly allowance. The one-line blurb promoting CPAC in Sydney bills the conference as a chance to \u2018learn\u2019, \u2018have fun\u2019 and \u2018protect the future\u2019. Learn \u2013 what are they going to learn? What do those attending hope to learn from rightwing proselytisers from other hemispheres?</p> <p>Why should our political discourse be polluted by imported poisons and propaganda? Fun \u2013 locked up in a conference room with a clique of visiting rightwing nutters who shouldn\u2019t be allowed in the country. Protect the future \u2013 God save us, if all of those that are in this bunch see themselves as our protectors.</p> <p>Mr President, I invite you to go to the Cpac website and take a look at the line-up of visiting speakers. Some of them shouldn\u2019t be allowed in this country.</p> <p>They obviously have not come by boat! That should not be the reason for them being banned from coming here \u2013 they are more likely to fit into an \u2018intellectual terrorist\u2019 category than that of a tourist. Their demagoguery is a danger to democracy.</p> <p>Australia is so intent on protecting its borders from refugees, but how about protecting our borders from prejudiced zealots and intellectual terrorists?</p> <p>Why do we need to hear the US congressman with a questionable record, Trumpified and infecting Australian politics?</p> <p>And what\u2019s there to learn about rightwing Americans? Or why do we need to hear from someone who is promoted as a \u2018British political activist\u2019\u2013someone who is really a racist bigot?</p> <p>Don\u2019t we have enough homegrown fascists and fanatics? We already have too much homegrown bigotry and racism in our country. Cpac has taken to social media to defend their invitation to this man. Apparently Cpac is proud to have him at the Sydney conference, arguing that free speech is at stake here.</p> <p>Like both of my colleagues, I am a strong defender of free speech, but, like my colleagues, I reject any right to hate speech.</p> <p>We already have enough homegrown bigots and racists in Australia. Extremism should not be allowed into our country. And if Cpac sees itself as the exemplar of Australian conservatism \u2013 look out, everyone.

There is a review under way but if there is a broad discussion going on between the Labor party membership my proposition is simply this. </p> <p>We need to examine the methods by which we determine our policies and the circumstances under which we determine them. The Labor party platform is determined by the Labor party conference \u2013 the commitment to make in terms of the party, the parliamentary executive, these are not matters you can simply remove with a clean sheet of paper. </p> <p>We do have to examine the campaign that was run, have to examine the techniques that we pursued in the messaging be pursued because there are separate questions on the question of the policy substance versus the capacity to communicate. </p> <p>And clearly what\u2019s happened in the last election was a big shock. It\u2019s a big shock around the country and a lot of money was spent on travel insurance. It had to be cashed in as a lot of the party people who have holidays planned had to cash those in. </p> <p>They didn\u2019t anticipate hanging in office any more than we anticipated it, so we need to look at the circumstances where the political system has not been able to respond adequately to people and we have got a Senate inquiry that revived some of these opportunities as well as the party review. </p> <p>[But it it is interesting] just to know, how it is that our messaging has gone so wrong.</p> <p>How it is that we have allowed ourselves to be separated from blue-collar communities and the way we have, and the manner by which identity politics has become so important in the modern discourse in the capacity for ordinary Australians to actually hear what is being said the manner of which is being said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T07:12:00.109Z\">at 8.12am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d4132968f08cf92bb77a3cf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T06:21:49.918Z\">7.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Kristina Keneally</strong> is also asked about Labor voting for the temporary exclusion orders, when it had serious concerns about the legislation. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think you might be referring to the temporary exclusion orders legislation that passed through the parliament last week. There is an important principle there, that we have a scheme in place to safely control and manage the return of foreign fighters, to put them on trial or to control them when they come back into the Australian communities. That is an important principle and not one I am going to just jettison but I am going to make the point that <strong>Peter Dutton </strong>is delivering a scheme that is questionably constitutional, that doesn\u2019t conform to the recommendations of a Liberal-dominated committee, but Patricia, I\u2019m going to be quite frankly putting the public interest first.</p> <p>If the choice is we have no scheme or we have a scheme that is flawed, I am going to go for the scheme that is flawed, and that is going to be on the government if it is proven to be flawed, because the alternative no scheme at all is not a good solution for the Australian community.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Which makes sense, but as Keneally said earlier, when asked whether Labor would vote to extend Asio\u2019s detention and questioning powers for another 12 months, if the government didn\u2019t accept its three-month amendment, given the government has the numbers, it doesn\u2019t matter what Labor does, in terms of the legislation passing.</p> <p>So the only reason Labor would vote for something it doesn\u2019t agree with is to make a statement. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T06:26:21.974Z\">at 7.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d4132108f08d0b6ca53b06e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T06:17:18.660Z\">7.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labor will not be joining the challenges <strong>Paul Karp </strong>has reported on today.

She is talking about the CPAC conference and why she believes Australia needs to stop some speakers from entering, because of what she says is their past hate speech:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it is incumbent on the government to consider two things here. One, will other people that are coming into Australia for this conference really fit within the definitions under our visa system? The immigration system gives the minister latitude to bar entry to Australia for people who seek to create division in the community, promote division in the community. They have seen fit to do that with other speakers in recent months. </p> <p>They haven\u2019t yet seen fit to do it here and I would encourage them to do so. I will also encourage the prime minister who says that he will speak out against extremism in all forms, to speak out against extremism that is coming into Australia through this conference, and particularly to call on his Liberal members not to go through with their appearance at this conference because when the Liberal party and its members go on stage, they give a tick and ... an OK to the type of hate speech that is being imported through this conference. And free speech is different to hate speech, and I\u2019m all for free speech. <strong>Amanda Stoker </strong>says we can talk to racists and decide how it will all be OK. </p> <p>That\u2019s not the case here because the government has already taken decisions to ban people who would seek to create racial division in Australia, and they should do that here.</p> <p>... I find it disturbing; we saw it in Senate question time, [<strong>Mathias Cormann</strong>] could not bring himself to say that it was OK for senator Stoker and Mr Kelly to appear on stage. He took these questions on notice; he condemned the remarks. Quite frankly, we cannot as an Australian community sit back and watch the values that make this country so successful, that <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> often said, we are the most successful multicultural nation on earth, we should uphold that and we shouldn\u2019t sit back and have a relaxed attitude when we have conferences being organised ...</p> <p>The point I\u2019m making is that we should not sit back and let this happen without calling it out, and calling on the Liberal National government to oppose same standards they have applied in recent months.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T06:19:50.631Z\">at 7.19am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d4128528f08d0b6ca53b02b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T05:34:42.753Z\">6.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My inbox is now full of statements from Labor shadow ministers with the title \u201cgovernment misleads on ...\u201d</p> <p>So liar is out, but mislead is in.

Why was that absolute undertaking given when people in Townsville are currently receiving debt recovery notices as recently as this month including this $2,000 robodebt issued on the 8 July? <br></p> <p><strong>Robert</strong>:<br></p> <p>The far north Queensland floods are no different. During natural disasters, such as cyclones, bushfires or floods, it is routine practice of the department of human services to temporarily suspend all complaints activities within an affected local area. This occurred in New South Wales and Victoria after the devastating bushfires earlier this year, as well as in previous natural disasters under governments of all persuasions. I agree is the right thing to do. <br></p> <p>As a general rule, this suspension is in place for six months unless extended. I have asked the department to extend the absence of debt recovery in northern Queensland for the foreseeable future until I\u2019m satisfied that the region has recovered. For the benefit of the house, when the department sends a notification to a citizen, this is what the notifications is. <br></p> <p>And I\u2019ll table it so we are all clear exactly what communication is sent to Australians. It says we need you to check and update your past income information. We need to make sure you receive the right amount of payments from us in the past. <br></p> <p>The ATO has given us information about how much income you earn from work in the past. The information from the ATO is different to the information you\u2019ve reported to us. <br></p> <p>We need your help to check and update your information, you need to do this even if you haven\u2019t received any CentreLink payments for a while. <br></p> <p>Then has a nice big box on what you need to do. You have 28 days from when you receive the letter to update your information. <br></p> <p>Over the page, you\u2019ll find the information we have received from the ATO. Please check this carefully, and then go to human services.gov.au,/ confirm income, or go to MyGov. Documents like payslips or bank statements will help you do this. <br></p> <p>This might mean you will have to pay back money. If you need help, go to human services.gov.au<br></p> <p> I table that documentation for the benefit of the House so everyone can be quite clear as to the type of information that the department sends out. It is sensitive, it doesn\u2019t seek to raise a debt in the first instance, it simply says to Australians, there is a discrepancy between what your assessment is and what the ATO has told us, and please call us.

And of course, as part of that, Mr Speaker, one of the very practical ways in which we are responding to the challenge of homelessness is $60m in grants to eligible organisations to provide new or expanding emergency accommodation facilities as well as $18m to support keeping women safe in their homes initiatives. <br></p> <p>So, Mr Speaker, we have a strong program and commitment when it comes to homelessness, $1.5m, and of course, funding of which can be provided thanks to our strong management of the economy. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T05:03:36.959Z\">at 6.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d411e258f08cf92bb77a368\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T04:52:22.782Z\">5.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The government is on the side of Australians concerned with reducing our waste.

On Monday night, when speaking on ABC television about the robodebt program, the minister said: \u201cThe department won\u2019t be going back after seven years in terms of recovering that.\u201d Why did the minister say that when he knew at the time it was untrue? <br></p> </blockquote> <p>(I wonder what the theme is today, thinking face emoji.)</p> <p><strong>Robert:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The department is moving forward on collecting or seeking income compliance debts from 2013-14. <br></p> <p>There are still existing debts, where customers have been sought to respond to from prior to that year. <br></p> <p>But when it comes to the issue of income compliance, Mr Speaker, it is important to understand where this all began. I refer to an article in the Australian in 2017, by <strong>Rick Morton</strong>, who writes that Labor\u2019s leadership team pioneered the robodebt scheme. <br></p> <p>The member for Sydney and the member for Maribyrnong other virtual godparents of robodebt. Where would Rick Morton have got that from? Rick Morton got that from a media release dated 29 June 2011, a joint media release issued by the member for Sydney and the member for Maribyrnong. It says that they are data matching to recover millions in welfare dollars.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Robert goes on to read from Labor\u2019s press release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A new data matching initiative is expected to claw back millions of dollars from welfare recipients who have debts with the Australian government. <br></p> <p>The minister for human services, <strong>Tanya Plibersek</strong>, and the assistant treasurer, <strong>Bill Shorten</strong>, today said the new initiative will enhance Centrelink\u2019s debt recovery ability and is expected to recover $71m over four years. Beginning on 1 July this year, Centrelink and the ATO will automatically match data on a daily basis as a way of crosschecking former welfare recipients who have a debt with the commonwealth. <br></p> <p>If people fail to come to an arrangement to settle their debts, the government has a responsibility to taxpayers to recover that money. Can I say to the former leader and deputy leader, we agree! We absolutely agree! <br></p> <p>Can I say to the godfather and godmother of income compliance from 2011, from the media release, and I will table it just for the efficacy and good memories of the leader of the opposition and the deputy leader. Income compliance, data matching on a daily basis, was started by those opposite, <strong>and now they seek to stop it in some faux degree of indignation that the income compliance lovechild of the godparents isn\u2019t what they hoped it to be.</strong> Will we have news for the opposition: what they began, we will continue to move forward in the interests of the Australian taxpayer.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p> I mean ... as a love child (or bastard, depending on how much romance you want to attach to my conception) I\u2019m not sure Robert made the best analogy there.

That is what we promised and that is what we delivered. <br></p> <p>And the Labor party sought to oppose us every step of the way.

We see problems, then, with crop production, with water sources being polluted and, in those situations, the food sources for many people, and particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, can be ruined, and particularly in lower-income countries this has a dramatic effect on people\u2019s capacity to gather food and have adequate nutrition. </p> <p>Over a longer term, if this is persistent, that has a bigger effect across wider populations, including higher-income countries too. </p> <p>A lot of research has come out of Canada and been studied over some time that when pregnant women are exposed to traumatic events and, in this case in the Canadian study, in extreme weather events and extreme ice and snowstorms during the early stages of pregnancy, it raises cortisol levels, which is the stress hormone that human beings have and when the stress hormone is raised in early pregnancy, it can have serious effects on the developing foetus and in these studies it\u2019s shown conclusively that the babies born of women who experienced this event had up to 14 IQ points lower than like peers and had longer-term learning development issues. </p> <p>First things first: prevention is better than cure. </p> <p>We need to seriously get on with the business of lowering emissions in Australia, encouraging other countries to do so too, particularly to assist our nearest neighbours in lowering emissions through adoption of renewable energy sources and other mechanisms.</p> <p>That\u2019s the first thing. But we must invest in climate adaption research and one of the things I\u2019m joining with the Global Health Alliance is to call for a multi-institutional research facility to be set up in rural Australia where we can work on innovation and mechanisms to adapt to climate and particularly in the area of health. </p> <p>I\u2019m calling on this for rural Australia because rural Australia is being affected right now. Rural Australia is experiencing extreme weather events which are right now having an effect on rural Australians\u2019 health, with respiratory diseases, with heatwave, responses to heatwave and multiple other impacts on health, including mental health as people try to adapt to prolonged periods of drought.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T03:45:00.232Z\">at 4.45am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d410bcc8f08cf92bb77a2fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T03:32:56.953Z\">4.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Just a reminder that the deadline for <strong>Peter Dutton\u2019s </strong>representative to table the strategic home affairs review which was completed but not made public in the Senate, is rapidly approaching. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d4109978f0845f89e317882\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T03:23:37.356Z\">4.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile ...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LindaBurneyMP/status/1156388645844090882\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Gov has just confirmed in the Senate that 1,054 people have enquired about coming off the Cashless Debit Card.

The headlines, in bold, are theirs:</p> <p><strong>REMARKABLE ALLEGATIONS</strong></p> <p>Last night senator Kristina Keneally launched an extraordinary attack in parliament against the inaugural Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Sydney next week. In a remarkable display of twisted logic, she claimed that conference speakers British political commentator and Muslim, <strong>Raheem Kassam</strong>, was Islamophobic and that Indigenous conservatives <strong>Warren Mundine</strong> and <strong>Jacinta Price</strong> were racist. </p> <p><strong>VISA BAN</strong></p> <p>She called on minister<strong> Peter Dutton</strong> to reject any visa application by Mr Kassam to visit Australia. Raheem Kassam is a Brexiteer and popular commentator and is attending and speaking alongside the head of the UK Brexit party, <strong>Nigel Farage</strong>. CPAC is proud to bring Raheem Kassam to Australia and rejects senator Keneally\u2019s embarrassing attempt to shut down political opponents. Australia is a country with a long history of free speech, something authoritarian hard left opponents such as senator Keneally seek to change simply because they sometimes do not like what their opponents might say. </p> <p><strong>GUILT BY ASSOCIATION</strong></p> <p>Ms Keneally cast aspersions on other speakers and attendees of CPAC including senator <strong>Amanda Stoker </strong>and <strong>Craig Kelly</strong> MP, by using the underhanded tactic of \u201cguilt by association\u201d. </p> <p>The implication of her attack is that speaking at the same event as those she basely accuses of racism is an endorsement of such views. Ms Keneally went so far as to describe the CPAC event as a \u201ctalkfest of hate\u201d, a ludicrous accusation that merely makes use of the kind of language that is used to shut down healthy debate \u2013 a fundamental component of a liberal democracy and a free society. She also describes the speaker list as a \u201cwho\u2019s who of right-wing extremism\u201d, a claim that is objectively false. </p> <p>CPAC organisers, the nonprofit LibertyWorks and the American Conservative Union, view these accusations as a clear indication that CPAC Australia conference is viewed by some as a threat to Ms Keneally\u2019s handlers in the Labor party.\u201d</p> <p>*end statement*</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T01:50:39.699Z\">at 2.50am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d40f0108f0845f89e3177ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T01:35:40.157Z\">2.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jason Clare </strong>was also talking about this on Sky this morning.

Without a federal integrity commission with teeth, public trust and confidence in our federal parliament will continue eroding,\u201d <strong>said David Harper AM, former Victorian supreme court judge and member of the Australia Institute national integrity committee.</strong></p> <p>Centre Alliance crossbench MP Rebekha Sharkie said independents and minor party members wanted the 46<sup>th</sup> parliament to establish a transparent, publicly accessible and properly resourced agency that could do the job the Australian people expected it to do.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a once in a generation opportunity so let\u2019s do it once and let\u2019s do it right,\u201d <strong>said Sharkie, member for Mayo.</strong></p> <p>\u201cThis is such an important area of public policy but the government is ignoring it,\u201d <strong>said senator Rex Patrick, Centre Alliance.</strong></p> <p>\u201cI will introduce legislation for an Icac with teeth. The latest Crown saga reinforces the need for a real Icac,\u201d<strong> said Adam Bandt, Greens member for Melbourne.</strong></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an urgent need for a national integrity commission and not the woefully inadequate model the government has put forward. The community is sick and tired of dodgy behaviour in Canberra. They want to see real action to tackle corruption \u2013 not just a pretence or half-baked measures,\u201d<strong> said Andrew Wilkie, independent member for Clark.</strong></p> <p>\u201cAustralians have an expectation that the parliament and public service meet the highest standards of integrity. We urgently need an effective, national anti-corruption body that is independent, well-resourced and with broad jurisdiction. It\u2019s time for transparency and accountability,\u201d <strong>said Zali Steggall, independent member for Warringah.</strong></p> <p>\u201cAustralians\u2019 trust in parliament is very low. I will work with my crossbench colleagues in the House and Senate for the establishment of a fully resourced commission that has independent authority to investigate, to hold public hearings, to deal effectively with political and public sector misconduct and corruption and to publish its findings.

Firstly, the ordinary norms of human engagement should apply in politics. Too often in our business they\u2019re left at the door. You can\u2019t have as your starting point where you want someone to be or where you think they should be. You\u2019ve got to have as your starting point where they are, respect that and then work back from there. When you do that, you can get good outcomes.</p> <p>Secondly, there are some commentators whose thesis is that the system of politics in Australia is broken, that it\u2019s not possible to achieve reform any more and that the press, the 24/7 media cycle, hung chambers and new quasipolitical groups make it all too hard. I could not disagree more. How challenges manifest themselves certainly changes, but the essence of politics is the same.</p> <p>Our core business is advocacy. Our core business is persuasion: to stake out some territory on an issue, to make a case, to argue it and to carry people along with you. The extent to which political practitioners fail to achieve their objectives is a failure of persuasion and of advocacy. So I encourage all my colleagues to reject the thesis that the system is broken and to embrace core business.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Which is a good message.

He is best known for inviting Holocaust denier <strong>Charles C Johnson </strong>to the 2018 state of the union address in the United States. The person Gaetz invited, Johnson, was permanently banned from Twitter in 2015 after asking for help \u201ctaking out\u201d a Black Lives Matter activist. In 2017 he denied that over 6 million Jewish people were killed in the Holocaust. </p> <p>Congressman Gaetz apologised later for providing the ticket to Mr Johnson. To quote the US lawmaker, he said, \u201cMr Johnson showed up at my door.\u201d Apparently you just have to show up at the congressman\u2019s door and you get to go to the state of the union address. At the same time, Congressman Gaetz insisted that Johnson was not a Holocaust denier \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s not a white supremacist.\u201d How does he know, if he just showed up at his door? For heaven\u2019s sake. These are the people.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Congressman Gaetz is also currently under investigation by the House ethics committee in the US for intimidating a witness. He\u2019s a lifetime member of the NRA \u2013 a commonality for these speakers \u2013 and says that the open carrying of weapons is a right granted not by government but by God.

Sort of how I imagine the Monkeypod lunches went down.</p> <p>Keneally delivered this speech while <strong>Amanda Stoker</strong> was in the president\u2019s chair, so you know, it certainly was direct.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have always welcomed political debate; I have chosen a career where I get to engage with people who hold different views to me, such as Senator McGrath. </p> <p>However, there is a difference between engaging in political debate and spewing vitriolic bile. </p> <p>There is a difference between meeting up at a political conference and associating with racists.</p> <p>And there is a difference between listening to political leaders and influencers and giving a platform to hate speech.</p> <p>Whilst Cpac may have an innocent name, it definitely is not innocent by nature.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to highlight that both the member for Hughes, <strong>Craig Kelly</strong>, and our senator from this place Amanda Stoker, the Liberal senator, are scheduled to be speaking at this event.</p> <p>Now I also note <strong>Warren Mundine</strong> \u2013 who the prime minister handpicked to be the Liberal candidate in Gilmore \u2013 is attending and speaking, along with the Liberal candidate <strong>Jacinta Price.</strong></p> <p>That is their prerogative if they would like to do that but I would like to bring to the Senate\u2019s attention the company these Liberal members of parliament will be keeping, associating with, and sharing a stage with next week.</p> <p> The speakers list is a who\u2019s who of rightwing extremism, with numerous guests having long records of attacks on women, on gay and lesbian people, on Islam, as well as having links to antisemitism.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T22:54:43.360Z\">at 11.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d40bcf78f08d0b6ca53adaf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T22:09:47.693Z\">11.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The new Labor senator <strong>Tim Ayres </strong>used his first speech in parliament to respond to Scott Morrison\u2019s latest invocation of the phrase \u201cunfunded empathy\u201d (he\u2019s used it a few times in the past, from at least 2015 onwards).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m proud to raise that. Yesterday the prime minister described raising Newstart as unfunded empathy. The grotesque, cowardly and dishonest comment. It\u2019s an insult to the 1 million Australians trapped in poverty and unemployment by the current rate. </p> <p>This raises unfunded only because his government refuses to fund it, presumably to defend his own surplus. It reveals a deeper, darker malice, a cruel pea-part beats inside the chest of this mean-spirited government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Labor has only recently openly and publicly called for Newstart to be raised, having hesitated before the election and committing to only reviewing it.</p> <p>That left the Coalition with plenty of room to move \u2013 it didn\u2019t even commit to reviewing it, because, well, it didn\u2019t have to. Labor\u2019s change of heart has now led to a Senate inquiry being set up to review the payment, to investigate by how much it should increase, and the cost to the budget.</p> <p>At the moment, the only side in the parliament not supportive of raising Newstart, or even reviewing it, is the Coalition. There are some outliers, but it is government policy to not touch it. Because it\u2019s too expensive. And it\u2019s not meant to be a substitute for a job. But no one says it is. And living on $350 a week is not exactly living large. But it might make the difference between eating or not. Or being able to get a bus ticket to get to that job interview or not. If anyone thinks that $350 a week is overly generous, well, I suggest you try it. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T23:05:06.143Z\">at 12.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d40b79c8f08cf92bb77a121\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T21:55:33.307Z\">10.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We are at the halfway point for the sitting \u2013 it is all downhill from here.</p> <p>Thank Rihanna.</p> <p>Once again, it is not legislation we are talking about. <strong>Eryk Bagshaw</strong> <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/completely-disempowered-liberal-staffers-speak-up-after-alleged-sexual-assaults-20190729-p52bnw.html\">from the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age published this story overnight</a>, which once again has focused attention on the culture within the Liberal party.</p> <p>There are, by my count, three reviews under way within the Liberal party at a state and federal level on how to bring more women into the party. There was, after the leadership spill, also a massive push, led by <strong>Kelly O\u2019Dwyer</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/17/morrison-asks-for-complaints-process-over-liberal-party-bullying-allegations\">to install a formal complaints process within the federal party</a>.</p> <p>Since then, the party has once again closed ranks, repeatedly assuring those who ask that processes are in place and everything is fine. But this story is bound to put those uncomfortable questions back into the spotlight.</p> <p>Speaking of uncomfortable questions, the Crossbench Five are getting louder in their calls for a federal Icac, after both Labor and the Coalition voted against a parliamentary inquiry into the Crown allegations and possible involvement of former and current parliamentarians. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/30/crown-casino-drivers-allegations-include-freely-available-drugs-and-no-border-checks-for-gamblers\">The government referred the allegations to the law enforcement integrity commission</a>, which it, and Labor used as the reason it was rejecting a parliamentary inquiry push. But the commission has no powers to investigate parliamentarians, which is why the crossbench are once again pushing for a federal integrity commission to deal with these issues.</p> <p>Before the election <strong>Christian Porter</strong> promised to install a commission. But it was seen by critics as being too limited, given that anyone before the commission would have their cases heard behind closed doors, with no one able to report on any investigation until any future court cases had concluded \u2013 and only then, when someone had been found guilty. Given how much the NSW Icac has uncovered from public hearings, that, understandably, had people upset. We haven\u2019t seen much move on that since the election, and the crossbench appear to have lost patience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1156108398993084421\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMissed it by that much\u201d Adam Bandt &amp; his colleagues, Helen Haines, Zali Steggall, Rebekha Sharkie and Andrew Wilkie for a Joint Standing Committee on Crown Casino-they were defeated 127 to 5 when the government and opposition voted together <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmyRemeikis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AmyRemeikis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@murpharoo</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GuardianAus</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/cWWIXjENrc\">pic.twitter.com/cWWIXjENrc</a></p>&mdash; Mikearoo (@mpbowers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1156108398993084421?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Oh, and the issue of Newstart just won\u2019t go away, so suddenly we see the release of figures on the number of people who have missed their \u201cmutual obligations\u201d (jobseeker meetings) from the government.</p> <p>DEIDRE CHAMBERS.</p> <p><strong>Michaelia Cash </strong>had this to say:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Coalition takes the mutual obligation of welfare recipients very seriously.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>When participants have their payments suspended up to 52 times in less than a year, they are not living up to what the taxpayer expects who are giving their hard-earned money to the government.</p> </blockquote> <p>I mean, she didn\u2019t say the words \u201cdole bludger\u201d but she hopes you get the gist.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where we will leave Politics Live for the day. For those asking, the minister representing the home affairs minister is yet to table the strategic review in the Senate, but we will keep an eye on it. We will follow that, and everything else the last sitting day before the winter break throws up from early tomorrow, so I do hope you\u2019ll join us. Given all the talk on Newstart though, I thought I would leave you with this picture, of Shelly Hayes and Ellen Kronen, who travelled from Lismore to parliament today with the Australian Council of Social Service to talk to MPs about why Newstart needs to increase and to remind them that Newstart recipients are humans. They shouldn\u2019t have to. We punish people for being poor, because there seems to be some deep-rooted sense that poverty is a choice. It\u2019s not and never has been. It\u2019s circumstance. It\u2019s existing within systems which are set up by those already privileged enough to access the opportunities. It is not and never has been as easy as \u2018having a go\u2019. And yet, increasingly, it seems that until we have direct experience with someone else\u2019s circumstances, or something approaching what their circumstance might be (a politician on a six-figure salary \u2018doing it tough\u2019 on a lower six-figure salary, for instance). We shouldn\u2019t have to have people explain that to us. And yet, here we are. Take care of you \u2013 and those around you. Pat Dodson has also spoken out in the Senate against the Cpac conference speakers: This could be a pantomime. This is a serious matter for the integrity of Australia. I stand in support of my colleagues Senator Wong and Senator Keneally in expressing concern about this conference, CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference, and about the standards that our leaders, particularly the Prime Minister, need to make clear when it comes to the participation of leaders from this place and other places. In the US, CPAC is an annual political conference attended by conservative activists and elected officials from across the United States. CPAC is hosted by the American Conservative Union. Now we have CPAC down under, with a conference in Sydney from 9 to 11 August. What\u2019s this about? Is this a sign that our fierce Australian characteristics of independent thinking are finally capitulating to rejected offerings from overseas? There was a time when we were concerned about how our national discourse was informed. Now it looks like we\u2019re submitting to poisonous ideas without reflection. You can buy a Reagan VIP Freedom Pass to the conference for $599. No one from Newstart will be there; that\u2019s more than their fortnightly allowance. The one-line blurb promoting CPAC in Sydney bills the conference as a chance to \u2018learn\u2019, \u2018have fun\u2019 and \u2018protect the future\u2019. Learn \u2013 what are they going to learn? What do those attending hope to learn from rightwing proselytisers from other hemispheres? Why should our political discourse be polluted by imported poisons and propaganda? Fun \u2013 locked up in a conference room with a clique of visiting rightwing nutters who shouldn\u2019t be allowed in the country. Protect the future \u2013 God save us, if all of those that are in this bunch see themselves as our protectors. Mr President, I invite you to go to the Cpac website and take a look at the line-up of visiting speakers. Some of them shouldn\u2019t be allowed in this country. They obviously have not come by boat! That should not be the reason for them being banned from coming here \u2013 they are more likely to fit into an \u2018intellectual terrorist\u2019 category than that of a tourist. Their demagoguery is a danger to democracy. Australia is so intent on protecting its borders from refugees, but how about protecting our borders from prejudiced zealots and intellectual terrorists? Why do we need to hear the US congressman with a questionable record, Trumpified and infecting Australian politics? And what\u2019s there to learn about rightwing Americans? Or why do we need to hear from someone who is promoted as a \u2018British political activist\u2019\u2013someone who is really a racist bigot? Don\u2019t we have enough homegrown fascists and fanatics? We already have too much homegrown bigotry and racism in our country. Cpac has taken to social media to defend their invitation to this man. Apparently Cpac is proud to have him at the Sydney conference, arguing that free speech is at stake here. Like both of my colleagues, I am a strong defender of free speech, but, like my colleagues, I reject any right to hate speech. We already have enough homegrown bigots and racists in Australia. Extremism should not be allowed into our country. And if Cpac sees itself as the exemplar of Australian conservatism \u2013 look out, everyone. It\u2019s time for the Prime Minister to act on this matter, as it is a threat to our nation. In case you didn\u2019t listen to that Afternoon Briefing interview with Patricia Karvelas, what you have there is a senior member of the Liberal party calling for the bullying review, which was set up after the leadership spill, to be brought forward. Arthur Sinodinos: The women in question did not get the support that they deserved and they decided to go public. It appears that these incidents sometime back that they were either compelled not to go ahead with them or action was just not taken, or they were ignored or whatever. So I feel for them, there is a review under way at the moment about what happened last year in terms of the allegations around the culture in some parts of the Liberal party because of the bullying around the time of leadership tensions, but that hasn\u2019t come to fruition yet. One of the things I\u2019d like to do with the end of the week, this federal executive meeting, and the margins of that, I\u2019m not attending the meeting itself, and in the margins of that I want to talk to others about how we expedite the review. I think we can\u2019t have a situation where people feel the only option is to go public in this way. I know some of my colleagues have said that the people in question should have gone straight to the police. That\u2019s true, but I can understand some circumstances people are reluctant to take that route because of the concern about the backwash on them, and if they are entirely innocent of anything, it\u2019s a very galling and very public process as you\u2019ve seen in other high-profile cases, so I think we need to get on with it and get the review completed as a measure it is to be taken to strengthen our internal processes and address these matters. ... The review was commissioned after the matters of August last year, so it has been going on a while now and I can understand that we\u2019ve had state elections, federal elections getting in the way, but the reality is that this is a priority and should be treated as a priority and finalised as a priority. Arthur Sinodinos also commented on the allegations put forward by two Liberal staffers regarding how they were treated when they reported alleged sexual abuse to the party. This is one of the stronger comments we have heard from a government MP. Sinodinos will be departing the Senate soon, to take over from Joe Hockey in Washington. How Mike Bowers saw question time: Soz Tfw you\u2019ve answered a question without knowing the context Do I smell toast? \u2018Merit\u2019 in action On the flipside, Patricia Karvelas asks Arthur Sinodinos about the government MPs and former MPs who are speaking at the conservative conference next month, which features some ... shall we say ... people who have said some terrible, awful, disgusting, bigoted and every other Trump adjective, things. Kristina Keneally has called for Peter Dutton to step in and, consistent with what happened with Milo Yiannopoulos, stop some of these speakers coming to Australia on the grounds of hate speech. James Paterson has been among the government MPs who have taken umbrage at the claim that Coalition MP speakers at this conference, which include Craig Kelly and Amanda Stoker, as well as former PM Tony Abbott, are tarred with the same brush. I mean, that is obviously completely different to tarring the Labor party for everything the CFMMEU and John Setka have done, but I digress. Sinodinos: Until it was raised in the parliament today I wasn\u2019t aware that he was coming and I don\u2019t know much about his background. People like that would get vetted on character grounds, and I know a number of other cases where other commentators, Milo Yiannopoulos for example. I must say on the whole though, often with these characters it is better to take them on publicly rather than to seek to drive these things underground, and what they mean by that is to take on the arguments and demolish them. If someone is a Holocaust denier, it is quite straight forward to prove that the Holocaust happened and that 6 million people needlessly lost their lives, and I don\u2019t think we should be afraid to show these people up for what they are. If you are asking me about the decision of some of my colleagues to appear at a conservative action conference, that is their individual decision, but people like Amanda Stoker and Craig Kelly are not the sort of people who would say some of the stuff that was alleged in question time. I think that they would be attending the conference and putting up the mainstream conservative views that they have heard them say in the parliament and elsewhere. Sinodinos says he believes any Coalition speaker at the event will call out those sorts of views \u201cif they get the opportunity\u201d. Kim Carr continues, to explain what he means about \u2018identity politics\u2019: Any group of people that are quite affluent, people who are articulate, people who are well-connected and often in the centre of the cities of our country. This is a problem that has emerged over time. The communication system is geared as city centric, it\u2019s channelling in to a cultural elite that\u2019s not necessarily reflective of the broader community. So when we talk about issues, and climate change for instance, we were not actually talking to the wrought mass of people, which reflect the seriousness of the issues, were getting to the heart of the question, and I\u2019m not saying that we abandon the science or misunderstanding how important these questions are, but we have to talk to people in a manner that we are able to be understood. We might say one thing but the people of this country might hear an entirely different thing. This has been happening for a while and I think too often is a presumption that we are talking to people who are already quite affluent, quite powerful, well-connected, and when talking broadly enough to those communities that have traditionally looked to Labor, who need government the most, who need to be able to see the resources of the government deployed to even up the score, who understand the political and economic system in this country, is not exactly working for the majority of people. And we have failed, I think in some respects, to be effective in our communication strategies. Kim Carr is asked by Patricia Karvelas about this story from Katharine Murphy: I\u2019ve had a very good response. There is a review under way but if there is a broad discussion going on between the Labor party membership my proposition is simply this. We need to examine the methods by which we determine our policies and the circumstances under which we determine them. The Labor party platform is determined by the Labor party conference \u2013 the commitment to make in terms of the party, the parliamentary executive, these are not matters you can simply remove with a clean sheet of paper. We do have to examine the campaign that was run, have to examine the techniques that we pursued in the messaging be pursued because there are separate questions on the question of the policy substance versus the capacity to communicate. And clearly what\u2019s happened in the last election was a big shock. It\u2019s a big shock around the country and a lot of money was spent on travel insurance. It had to be cashed in as a lot of the party people who have holidays planned had to cash those in. They didn\u2019t anticipate hanging in office any more than we anticipated it, so we need to look at the circumstances where the political system has not been able to respond adequately to people and we have got a Senate inquiry that revived some of these opportunities as well as the party review. [But it it is interesting] just to know, how it is that our messaging has gone so wrong. How it is that we have allowed ourselves to be separated from blue-collar communities and the way we have, and the manner by which identity politics has become so important in the modern discourse in the capacity for ordinary Australians to actually hear what is being said the manner of which is being said. Kristina Keneally is also asked about Labor voting for the temporary exclusion orders, when it had serious concerns about the legislation. I think you might be referring to the temporary exclusion orders legislation that passed through the parliament last week. There is an important principle there, that we have a scheme in place to safely control and manage the return of foreign fighters, to put them on trial or to control them when they come back into the Australian communities. That is an important principle and not one I am going to just jettison but I am going to make the point that Peter Dutton is delivering a scheme that is questionably constitutional, that doesn\u2019t conform to the recommendations of a Liberal-dominated committee, but Patricia, I\u2019m going to be quite frankly putting the public interest first. If the choice is we have no scheme or we have a scheme that is flawed, I am going to go for the scheme that is flawed, and that is going to be on the government if it is proven to be flawed, because the alternative no scheme at all is not a good solution for the Australian community.\u201d Which makes sense, but as Keneally said earlier, when asked whether Labor would vote to extend Asio\u2019s detention and questioning powers for another 12 months, if the government didn\u2019t accept its three-month amendment, given the government has the numbers, it doesn\u2019t matter what Labor does, in terms of the legislation passing. So the only reason Labor would vote for something it doesn\u2019t agree with is to make a statement. Labor will not be joining the challenges Paul Karp has reported on today. From acting national secretary, Paul Erickson: \u201cLabor is disappointed by the tactics employed by the Liberal party at the election, which went well beyond the accepted bounds of a vigorously contested campaign \u2013 especially in the divisions of Chisholm and Kooyong. \u201cThe Chinese-language signs used by the Liberal party in those contests were clearly designed to look like official Australian Electoral Commission voting instructions using the AEC colours, for the clear purpose of misleading Mandarin and Cantonese-speaking voters into voting for the Liberal party. \u201cWhile Labor believes there is a strong case that the signs were a breach of the Electoral Act, the significant cost and protracted nature of a legal challenge means we will not be seeking to overturn the outcome through legal action in the court of disputed returns. \u201cInstead, our focus will be on holding the Morrison Liberal government to account and working hard to secure a majority at the next election. \u201cI spoke today with Jennifer Yang, who contested Chisholm on behalf of the Labor party, who echoed her disappointment at the tactics engaged by the Liberal party.\u201d Ms Yang said: \u201cOver the last two months, many members of the local community raised with me how deeply concerned they were about the deceptive tactics employed by the Liberal party. \u201cIt is disappointing that the Liberal party engaged in such disgraceful and misleading behaviour. The people of Chisholm deserved better.\u201d Kristina Keneally is the first guest on Afternoon Briefing. She is talking about the CPAC conference and why she believes Australia needs to stop some speakers from entering, because of what she says is their past hate speech: I think it is incumbent on the government to consider two things here. One, will other people that are coming into Australia for this conference really fit within the definitions under our visa system? The immigration system gives the minister latitude to bar entry to Australia for people who seek to create division in the community, promote division in the community. They have seen fit to do that with other speakers in recent months. They haven\u2019t yet seen fit to do it here and I would encourage them to do so. I will also encourage the prime minister who says that he will speak out against extremism in all forms, to speak out against extremism that is coming into Australia through this conference, and particularly to call on his Liberal members not to go through with their appearance at this conference because when the Liberal party and its members go on stage, they give a tick and ... an OK to the type of hate speech that is being imported through this conference. And free speech is different to hate speech, and I\u2019m all for free speech. Amanda Stoker says we can talk to racists and decide how it will all be OK. That\u2019s not the case here because the government has already taken decisions to ban people who would seek to create racial division in Australia, and they should do that here. ... I find it disturbing; we saw it in Senate question time, [Mathias Cormann] could not bring himself to say that it was OK for senator Stoker and Mr Kelly to appear on stage. He took these questions on notice; he condemned the remarks. Quite frankly, we cannot as an Australian community sit back and watch the values that make this country so successful, that Malcolm Turnbull often said, we are the most successful multicultural nation on earth, we should uphold that and we shouldn\u2019t sit back and have a relaxed attitude when we have conferences being organised ... The point I\u2019m making is that we should not sit back and let this happen without calling it out, and calling on the Liberal National government to oppose same standards they have applied in recent months.\u201d My inbox is now full of statements from Labor shadow ministers with the title \u201cgovernment misleads on ...\u201d So liar is out, but mislead is in. Potato/potatoh lives on. Authorities in Western Australia have charged live export company Emanuel Exports and two former directors with animal welfare offences over a shipment to the Middle East in August 2017, in which more than 2,400 sheep died of heat stress. Footage of the voyage was leaked by whistleblowers to Animals Australia and prompted the review of the heat stress standards for sheep export, which saw both the live export industry and the federal regulator place a ban on the export of sheep from Australia to the Middle East during the northern summer this year. The charges follow an 18-month investigation from the WA primary industries and regional development department, which began before the whistleblower footage was leaked. Emanuel Exports\u2019 managing director, Nicholas Daws, said the company would \u201cvigorously defend the matter in court\u201d. The court date has not yet been set. David Gillespie is delivering a personal statement on the reporting of his comments at the doorstop this morning. He says he has been misrepresented because he was unaware of the allegations raised in the SMH and the Age, because he hadn\u2019t read the story, and thought it was in relation to the leadership spill last year. So he was \u201cmisrepresented\u201d because he commented on something without knowing anything about it. And apparently thought it was normal journalists would be asking about a story almost a year after it was first aired. Just randomly bringing it up on a Wednesday morning. Cool. Beans. Labor\u2019s Penny Wong and Kristina Keneally have been asking Mathias Cormann about the objectionable views of attendees of the CPAC conference, using them to attack the government because MP Craig Kelly and senator Amanda Stoker have agreed to speak at the same event. For the most part, Cormann took the questions on notice, but Keneally quoting Raheem Kassam\u2019s comments about taping Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s mouth shut and her legs \u201cso she can\u2019t reproduce\u201d finally elicited a response. Cormann: The comments that senator Keneally just quoted are disgraceful, highly objectionable and completely outrageous, that I entirely abhor and I\u2019m sure anyone in this Senate chamber abhors. I don\u2019t think that that is a partisan position. These are disgusting comments and I reject them entirely and utterly. I would make the general point that just because you are at an event, you\u2019re not expected to agree with everything that everybody says at that same event. We\u2019ve all been at events in our electorates where people have made highly objectionable points.\u201d When Keneally asked if the Australian government will cancel Kassam\u2019s visa, Cormann replied that he won\u2019t comment on individual cases but all non-citizens must meet the character requirements. \u201cThe strong provisions to refuse or cancel a visa where a person is not of good character will be considered balancing the risk with well established freedom of speech/beliefs.\u201d Wong is now taking note of answers, describing the CPAC conference as an \u201cacademy to learn the dark arts of hate speech\u201d. Wong called on Scott Morrison to make good on promises to promote harmony after the Christchurch attacks and prevent Coalition members from attending. Senator James Paterson said it is a \u201ccheap and nasty smear\u201d to tar Coalition members with the opinions of others speaking at an event. Mark Coulton has a statement to make. He says for the information of the House, the Labor party did instigate a number of trade agreements. Question time ends. And it ends when the papers aren\u2019t even stacked! The government is on the side of flood victims. It will personally yell at the clouds for the next six years for inflicting this tragedy upon you. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: In May the prime minister said his government had \u201cintroduced some passed legislation to deal with the threat of wildlife extinction\u201d. Legislation that at the time didn\u2019t exist and still doesn\u2019t. Why does the prime minister just make stuff up? That is in relation to this story. Morrison: Our government is committed to taking action on the concerns of Australians when it comes to protecting the local quality of our environment. The member for Latrobe, now the assistant minister, during the last election, and in the lead-up to that election, mounted a campaign amongst his local community to ensure that our government was taking action to protect species. That is what our government has been doing and that is what we will continue to keep doing.\u201d Siri, show me \u201cnon answer\u201d. The government is so on the side of workers, it will cover your shift and give you the money no problem. It will deal with Karen in finance for you. It will talk to the Michael McCormack of your office at the Christmas party and act like a human shield. And it will never eat your lunch in the office fridge. Bill Shorten to Stuart Robert The government\u2019s given an absolute undertaking that the debt recovery in the Townsville area hasn\u2019t commenced. Why was that absolute undertaking given when people in Townsville are currently receiving debt recovery notices as recently as this month including this $2,000 robodebt issued on the 8 July? Robert: The far north Queensland floods are no different. During natural disasters, such as cyclones, bushfires or floods, it is routine practice of the department of human services to temporarily suspend all complaints activities within an affected local area. This occurred in New South Wales and Victoria after the devastating bushfires earlier this year, as well as in previous natural disasters under governments of all persuasions. I agree is the right thing to do. As a general rule, this suspension is in place for six months unless extended. I have asked the department to extend the absence of debt recovery in northern Queensland for the foreseeable future until I\u2019m satisfied that the region has recovered. For the benefit of the house, when the department sends a notification to a citizen, this is what the notifications is. And I\u2019ll table it so we are all clear exactly what communication is sent to Australians. It says we need you to check and update your past income information. We need to make sure you receive the right amount of payments from us in the past. The ATO has given us information about how much income you earn from work in the past. The information from the ATO is different to the information you\u2019ve reported to us. We need your help to check and update your information, you need to do this even if you haven\u2019t received any CentreLink payments for a while. Then has a nice big box on what you need to do. You have 28 days from when you receive the letter to update your information. Over the page, you\u2019ll find the information we have received from the ATO. Please check this carefully, and then go to human services.gov.au,/ confirm income, or go to MyGov. Documents like payslips or bank statements will help you do this. This might mean you will have to pay back money. If you need help, go to human services.gov.au I table that documentation for the benefit of the House so everyone can be quite clear as to the type of information that the department sends out. It is sensitive, it doesn\u2019t seek to raise a debt in the first instance, it simply says to Australians, there is a discrepancy between what your assessment is and what the ATO has told us, and please call us. I reiterate to all Australians: if you receive a letter like that, call the department, because it is here to assist. The government is on the side of Australians who can\u2019t find car parks. It is so on your side, it will personally carry your car, wearing bread packets on its feet, through the snow and floods, to make sure you can grab that Newtown piccolo. It will insert molecules into its DNA to turn itself into a bus and get you to where you need to go. It will drive around the block for three hours while you watch Top Gun II. Meanwhile Mark Coulton, who Labor says has misled the chamber in his answer through his characterisation of Labor\u2019s trade agreement record, has so far received counsel from Barnaby Joyce, David Littleproud and Michael McCormack. Jason Clare to Paul Fletcher: Why did the assistant minister for home affairs claim that the rate of homelessness is quote \u201cnot ahead of population growth\u201d, when in fact homelessness is nearly growing at nearly double the rate of Australian\u2019s population? Fletcher: I think our government has a strong track record when it comes to housing, including a strong track record, $1.5bn under the national homelessness agreement to support homelessness services and under that agreement $125m is set aside for homelessness services in 2019-20. The states are matching this funding and have a focus on women and children affected by family and domestic violence. And of course the prime minister earlier this year announced that hundreds more women and children are escaping domestic violence to a safe place to sleep with a $78m investment by the Morrison government, including forming part of our $328m investment to support the fourth action plan of the national plan to reduce violence against women and their children. And I would certainly hope, Mr Speaker, I would certainly hope, that there is acknowledgment of the bipartisan commitment to the importance of government action in this area under the fourth action plan of the national plan to reduce violence against women and their children. And of course, as part of that, Mr Speaker, one of the very practical ways in which we are responding to the challenge of homelessness is $60m in grants to eligible organisations to provide new or expanding emergency accommodation facilities as well as $18m to support keeping women safe in their homes initiatives. So, Mr Speaker, we have a strong program and commitment when it comes to homelessness, $1.5m, and of course, funding of which can be provided thanks to our strong management of the economy. The government is on the side of Australians concerned with reducing our waste. It is so on your side, it will personally follow you around spraying air freshener, if you need it. It will personally grow the worm farms and collect your compost. It will build statues in your honour out of your left over take-away containers. We are back to Melissa Price: Why did the government say that 90% of the work on the submarine project would be Australian, when it won\u2019t be? The minister for defence industry? Price: Back in 2016 we announced a $200bn Australian defence white paper. Included in that is our $90bn naval shipbuilding project. There will be thousands of opportunities within that naval shipbuilding program with respect to jobs for Australians, small businesses. There is an enormous supply chain with respect to shipbuilding and we aren\u2019t done yet. Melissa Price just got in trouble for straying off topic in a dixer answer her office wrote. #deathtodixers The government is on the side of the defence industry. It will give the defence industry a kidney if it needs it. Both of them. It is so on the side of the defence industry, it will camp outside the Apple store for the new iPhone for it, three days in advance of its release. Madeleine King to Mark Coulton: In his last question, the minister for trade and investment said that Labor didn\u2019t sign a trade agreement in its last period of government. Is that true? Coulton: (Simon Birmingham is in the Senate.) ... When this government came to power, 30% of our trade was covered by three trade agreements. It is now 70%. The government is on the side of local investors. It would take a bullet for local investors. It will tell your wife you\u2019re actually at their place, playing poker, and not at the local Furry club, if you\u2019d like. Ged Kearney to Greg Hunt: The minister for home affairs said Australians in waiting lines at public hospitals would be \u201ckicked off those waiting lines because people from Nauru and Manus would be accessing those health services\u201d. Minister, did that happen? Hunt: The significant thing that has happened is this government took steps through the prime minister to make sure that there wasn\u2019t a waiting list of people coming to the mainland. That is what the prime minister did when he opened up Christmas Island. That was a significant step ... That we did not encounter the very problem that the minister for home affairs warned about. The minister for home affairs identified the problem [and] the prime minister solved it.\u201d Solved it ... by it never actually being a thing? In which case I have solved the problem of Idris Elba\u2019s undying love for me, and Rihanna\u2019s and Beyonce\u2019s constant friend requests. Sunrise has apologised for the wording in a tweet containing its Newstart story which said \u201cNew figures have been released showing just how many dole bludgers are trying to take advantage of the welfare system\u201d after many, including journalists Sam Maiden and Juanita Phillips, called out the language. To be clear, no one was talking about the actual story, which was a straight up and down, balanced report on the figures release and the motivations of the government in releasing them. But the language in the tweet is exactly what we have been talking about all day \u2013 and it\u2019s wrong. Tony Burke to Christian Porter: Why did he advise the House that the former Labor government cut funding to the fair work ombudsman by 70% when in fact it increased funding by 96%? Why did he also claim that staff were cut by 20% when in fact staffing rose by 97%?\u201d Porter: I advised the House that when Labor were last in office they cut funding to the fair work ombudsman by 70% and there stopping by 20%, and the reason I advised the House of that is because it is true. What happened with the funding is that there was a time when it reached a peak, and when you were struggling around for your four surpluses delivered in one night you cut the funding from underneath them. The funding and staffing went radically down and the number of investigations went radically down, and Australian workers who wanted a robust organisation to investigate underpayment were left in the lurch. That is what happened, and that is why I informed the house of that.\u201d He goes on to the ensuring integrity bill. Honestly though, the workload must be getting to him (he is basically carrying the whole government\u2019s agenda at the moment, plus trying to run the House) because his answer is certainly a certain Porter de vivre. Karen Andrews is talking about how the government is on the side of manufacturers which, sure, unless you are a car manufacturer, because that didn\u2019t go so well. \u201cUnder the Morrison government we are making manufacturing great again,\u201d Andrews says in a statement, so *Karen* managers everywhere get a shiver down their back. Chris Bowen to Greg Hunt: \u201cWhy did the minister yesterday claim that the granting of an MRI Medicare licence to Sound Radiology was \u2018not under an independent process\u2019 when in fact they were signed off by him in his ministerial office?\u201d Labor MPs pretend to be shocked by this question. To be honest, their ooooohhhhhhh could do with some work. In case you haven\u2019t worked it out, the theme of this QT as far as Labor is concerned is \u2018Why did you [insert minister here] make this misleading statement? LISTEN TO ALL THE MISLEADING STATEMENTS. I mean, the party has been banned from using the word liar except in extreme cases, but if they could paint you a picture with pants on fire, that\u2019s something completely different. Hunt: That is not an accurate representation of what I said. As I confirmed in the House, final decisions ... there are two parts to this, as I said yesterday. No, no. Its application was assessed by the department against a mandatory and substantive criteria outlined in the ATA documentation and all MRI licences are located in the expansion round met the department\u2019s criteria and as they sat in the House yesterday, final decisions were signed off by the Minister. Now this is very interesting. Absolutely. This is very interesting because I\u2019ve been doing a little bit of research into historic processes in this space. (\u201cWere you looking up Wikipedia again,\u201d someone from Labor yells.) And I was hoping she might intervene because this morning the leader of the opposition made an interview in South Australia where he referred to what the Labor party did and he made four errors in one minute in one answer on this. And apart from misrepresenting from what we said yesterday, he also said that Labor went through a process in these matters were determined as they were, but in fact we have gone back and we know from the AMA report that they were determined by the minister. He also said, and I quote \u2018People weren\u2019t making a profit by definition\u2019. Labor awarded these licences to public hospitals. I actually go to the member for Sydney\u2019s release of the 1 November 2012, the member for Sydney, the member for Sturt announced 11 licences in South Australia. And I\u2019ll just list some of them. Doctor Jones and partners, Tennyson centre, Adelaide, Adelaide area, Adelaide diagnostic imaging. Doctor Jones and partners in South Terrace, one in North Terrace in Adelaide. What we see as Benson radiology, Salisbury. All of these show that what the leader of the opposition said this morning was absolute bunk. What he said was the difference is Labor awarded these licences to hospitals, public hospitals, that went to processes. So people weren\u2019t making a profit by definition, and that may be why the ANAO looked at what Labor did and slammed the member for Sydney ...\u201d Catherine King yells out something like \u201cLet\u2019s see what the ANAO says,\u201d and is thrown out under section 94a, which is not the punishment the Speaker seems to think it is. Bob Katter appeared to just blurt a bunch of words out at the microphone, or maybe I just had a stroke. I don\u2019t smell toast, but I just can\u2019t tell. All I know is that I can make no sense of those words. Richard Marles to Josh Frydenberg: Why did the treasurer say yesterday Australians were certainly better off than in 2013, when the data shows that since 2013 wages have been stagnant, household debt has risen, growth has slowed, and median household income has declined in real terms? Frydenberg: Well, Mr Speaker, Australians are better off than they were in 2013 because we have created 1.4m new jobs, Mr Speaker. Thank you for that question, because unemployment was 5.7% in 2013. Today it is 5.2%. Mr Speaker, when we came to government, the gender pay gap was 17.2%. Today it is 14.2%, and a record low, Mr Speaker. When we came to government, employment growth was around 0.7% per year, Mr Speaker. Today it is 2.4%. And Mr Speaker, the other reason why Australians are better off today is because tax cuts have passed this parliament, Mr Speaker. $13m Australians are getting tax cuts because of what we have done on the side of the house. Because unlike Sir Taxalot over there, we are not telling the people of our electorates that we are going to put a retiree tax on them, but they are. We\u2019re not telling them is going to be an increased tax on superannuation, but they are, Mr Speaker. And we are not telling them that we are going to burden family businesses and income earners with higher taxes, because on this side of the house we want Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn.\u201d That question is because Frydenberg cherry picked the Hilda data yesterday to answer his question. SHOCK. Also, I think someone needs to explain to the treasurer how a microphone works. In that you don\u2019t need to yell into a microphone because its literal job is to amplify your voice so that you don\u2019t have to yell. I am aspirational that eventually this message will sink in. As will the idea that just because you think something is clever, doesn\u2019t mean everyone else will. I mean, Sir Taxalot was a mild burn at best. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has addressed allegations of \u201cbullying, harassment and assault\u201d in the media from two former Liberal staffers, describing them in a statement to the Senate as \u201cdeeply distressing and concerning\u201d. The statement was heavy on detail of what current or former staffers should do with a complaint and light on detail about what the Liberal party did or didn\u2019t do with these two particular complaints. Cormann explains that legislation which governs hiring of staffers gives them a right to have complaints investigated confidentially by the department which will tell the member or senator with the consent of the complainant to \u201callow them to address remaining risks in their workplace and take other actions that could or should be taken\u201d. Cormann said that alleged criminal assault \u201cshould be referred to the police for investigation\u201d. \u201cThere is no place for any form of bullying, intimidation or harassment in any workplace \u2013 and the Australian parliament is no different.\u201d Michael McCormack is summoned to the despatch box and the chamber shows the same level of enthusiasm one would face four-day-old sliced bread for breakfast. The question also includes the phrase \u201cdemonstrate to the Australian people how the government is on their side\u201d which is a series of words which now cause my eyes to involuntarily roll so far back inside my head they end up somewhere in January. Linda Burney to Stuart Robert: My question is to the minister for government services. On Monday night, when speaking on ABC television about the robodebt program, the minister said: \u201cThe department won\u2019t be going back after seven years in terms of recovering that.\u201d Why did the minister say that when he knew at the time it was untrue? (I wonder what the theme is today, thinking face emoji.) Robert: The department is moving forward on collecting or seeking income compliance debts from 2013-14. There are still existing debts, where customers have been sought to respond to from prior to that year. But when it comes to the issue of income compliance, Mr Speaker, it is important to understand where this all began. I refer to an article in the Australian in 2017, by Rick Morton, who writes that Labor\u2019s leadership team pioneered the robodebt scheme. The member for Sydney and the member for Maribyrnong other virtual godparents of robodebt. Where would Rick Morton have got that from? Rick Morton got that from a media release dated 29 June 2011, a joint media release issued by the member for Sydney and the member for Maribyrnong. It says that they are data matching to recover millions in welfare dollars.\u201d Robert goes on to read from Labor\u2019s press release. A new data matching initiative is expected to claw back millions of dollars from welfare recipients who have debts with the Australian government. The minister for human services, Tanya Plibersek, and the assistant treasurer, Bill Shorten, today said the new initiative will enhance Centrelink\u2019s debt recovery ability and is expected to recover $71m over four years. Beginning on 1 July this year, Centrelink and the ATO will automatically match data on a daily basis as a way of crosschecking former welfare recipients who have a debt with the commonwealth. If people fail to come to an arrangement to settle their debts, the government has a responsibility to taxpayers to recover that money. Can I say to the former leader and deputy leader, we agree! We absolutely agree! Can I say to the godfather and godmother of income compliance from 2011, from the media release, and I will table it just for the efficacy and good memories of the leader of the opposition and the deputy leader. Income compliance, data matching on a daily basis, was started by those opposite, and now they seek to stop it in some faux degree of indignation that the income compliance lovechild of the godparents isn\u2019t what they hoped it to be. Will we have news for the opposition: what they began, we will continue to move forward in the interests of the Australian taxpayer.\u201d I mean ... as a love child (or bastard, depending on how much romance you want to attach to my conception) I\u2019m not sure Robert made the best analogy there. Plus there is the whole issue of who actually raised the robodebt bastard. Over in the Senate, Mathias Cormann is addressing Eryk Bagshaw\u2019s story. Scott Morrison has not said anything on it as yet, so this is the first senior minister comment. The chamber is ROWDY today. Keith Pitt asks Scott Morrison to explain just how on the side of Australians the government is. VERY is the answer. In fact, the government is so on your side, when you look back and see just one set of footsteps, that is when it carried you*. *Unless you are on Newstart, an asylum seeker, or an inner-city coffee quaffer. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: (Morrison looks a little surprised by this call up. Lately he has been ignored by the Labor party, as it puts it \u201cweak link\u201d strategy into action.) The prime minister said that tax cuts would be legislated before the 1 July. He said that member for Durack would remain environment minister, and he said that the government would create a national integrity commission. Where any of those commitments true? Morrison: I\u2019m very thankful for the leader of the opposition for raising the issue of our commitment to tax cuts. Mr Speaker, those tax cuts, which not only provide tax relief today, but provide tax relief to Australians out in the future as well, for Australians, so the harder they work, the more they earn, and the more they keep of what they earn. That is what we promised and that is what we delivered. And the Labor party sought to oppose us every step of the way. They remain opposed to tax relief, and if they have the opportunity they will roll back the tax relief that has been legislated for the Australian community. Even now, several months after the election, the Labor party continues to tear itself apart about his $387bn of higher taxes. They have members over there who are clinging on to those taxes for dear life. They worked so hard to put that massive tax burden in their election platform to take to the Australian people, and now they know they have to make a choice. Are they going to tax Australians more or follow the government\u2019s approach to make sure they get expenditure under control, that the government lives within its means, that it can deliver the central services that Australians rely on? That is what my government is delivering.\u201d Speaking of the chamber, this is worth taking note of. We are in the chamber, so who\u2019s that MP? It\u2019s Andrew Laming, from Queensland. This game is as much for me as it is the blog \u2013 I look into the chamber every single parliament sitting day and swear there is someone I have never seen before in my life sitting down there. It\u2019s almost question time. Who will be anointed Labor\u2019s weak link target today? Or will it be targets? WHO KNOWS? All I do know is: the GOVERNMENT IS ON YOUR SIDE. Given a climate emergency has been declared in Darwin, our Pacific neighbours keep screaming at us to pay attention and Siberia is currently on fire, this from Helen Haines (speaking to the ABC) is timely: I don\u2019t think people have fully realised yet the impact that climate change is already having and potentially will have on Australia and our near neighbourhood of the Asia-Pacific region. What we see with climate change is extreme weather events and when we have extreme weather events, we have higher incidence of flooding, higher temperatures. We see problems, then, with crop production, with water sources being polluted and, in those situations, the food sources for many people, and particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, can be ruined, and particularly in lower-income countries this has a dramatic effect on people\u2019s capacity to gather food and have adequate nutrition. Over a longer term, if this is persistent, that has a bigger effect across wider populations, including higher-income countries too. A lot of research has come out of Canada and been studied over some time that when pregnant women are exposed to traumatic events and, in this case in the Canadian study, in extreme weather events and extreme ice and snowstorms during the early stages of pregnancy, it raises cortisol levels, which is the stress hormone that human beings have and when the stress hormone is raised in early pregnancy, it can have serious effects on the developing foetus and in these studies it\u2019s shown conclusively that the babies born of women who experienced this event had up to 14 IQ points lower than like peers and had longer-term learning development issues. First things first: prevention is better than cure. We need to seriously get on with the business of lowering emissions in Australia, encouraging other countries to do so too, particularly to assist our nearest neighbours in lowering emissions through adoption of renewable energy sources and other mechanisms. That\u2019s the first thing. But we must invest in climate adaption research and one of the things I\u2019m joining with the Global Health Alliance is to call for a multi-institutional research facility to be set up in rural Australia where we can work on innovation and mechanisms to adapt to climate and particularly in the area of health. I\u2019m calling on this for rural Australia because rural Australia is being affected right now. Rural Australia is experiencing extreme weather events which are right now having an effect on rural Australians\u2019 health, with respiratory diseases, with heatwave, responses to heatwave and multiple other impacts on health, including mental health as people try to adapt to prolonged periods of drought.\u201d Just a reminder that the deadline for Peter Dutton\u2019s representative to table the strategic home affairs review which was completed but not made public in the Senate, is rapidly approaching. Meanwhile ... There hasn\u2019t been a lot of praise flowing between these two parties recently, so this is notable: Jacqui Lambie says she will consider telling the government \u201cwhere to stick their bills\u201d if the federal integrity commission it comes up with doesn\u2019t have \u201cmore teeth than Jaws\u201d. The government needs her vote for the medevac repeal and wants it for the ensuring integrity legislation. There are two more challenges in the court of disputed returns: one by Naomi Hall against Liberal MP Gladys Liu in Chisholm and one by independent Oliver Yates against Josh Frydenberg in Kooyong. Both challenges are based on Chinese-language signs which instructed voters that the \u201ccorrect voting method\u201d was to vote 1 for the Liberal candidate, arguing that these signs were \u201clikely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote\u201d in breach of the Electoral Act. The first petition notes that more than 20% of voters in Chisholm speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home and are likely to be able to read Chinese; and in Kooyong the figure is about 12%. Hall\u2019s case argues that as a consequence some voters were likely to have voted 1 for Liu \u201cnotwithstanding that such was not the vote that they otherwise intended to cast\u201d and argues \u201chad it been the elector\u2019s intention to direct his or her first preference to a candidate other than Liu, that intention was not realised\u201d. Hall wants a declaration that the election in Chisholm is void. Maybe certain representatives are too busy watching city dwellers \u201cquaffing\u201d coffees, to tackle this issue from the National Farmers\u2019 Federation: Fed-up farmers, doctors, surgeons, farm safety experts and rural community members will deliver an ultimatum to the Government in Canberra this week: take action on quad bike safety or more lives will be lost. Unbelievably, the Government continues to stall on implementing recommendations to improve the safety of the popular but dangerous farm vehicle. Led by the NFF, today and tomorrow, the group will continue its call for the adoption of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission\u2019s recommendation to mandate the fitting of Operator Protection Devices (OPDs) to all new quad bikes with 24 months. \u201cAlready this year, seven Australians, including children have lost their lives in quad bike incidents,\u201d NFF Workforce Committee Chair, Farm Safe Chair and NSW farmer, Charles Armstrong said. More than half of the deaths caused by quad bikes are a result of a rollover, often by crushing or asphyxiation, which OPDs prevent. \u201cDeaths and life-altering injuries from quad bikes continue to cut at the heart of rural and regional communities. \u201cThe Government has the opportunity right now, to stem these incidents, but for reasons which aren\u2019t clear to us, has failed to act.\u201d Seems the \u201cunfunded empathy\u201d comment has made it\u2019s way out of the Canberra bubble* *TM Mark Dreyfus on the ensuring integrity (some, but not all unions and leaders are terrible, probably) bill: Putting to one side the many problems with the Liberal party\u2019s preferred model for a commonwealth integrity commission \u2013 their title \u2013 it is notable that we haven\u2019t heard a peep from the attorney general or any other member of the government about their proposed commonwealth integrity commission since the election. There have been no sermons from them about ensuring the integrity of this parliament or the government of Australia. They are so allergic to ensuring integrity \u2013 that\u2019s the title of this bill \u2013 and ensuring integrity in their own ranks that they can\u2019t even bring themselves to talk about an election commitment that they made, which was to bring legislation for a commonwealth integrity commission to this parliament. Just to go back to the list, published by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, of legislation that\u2019s proposed for introduction to this parliament in 2019. There is nothing about the commonwealth integrity commission. They have listed, however, the overseas welfare recipients integrity program bill as a priority; the social services legislation amendment (payment integrity) bill is also apparently a priority \u2013 again, these are very small, focused, targeted integrity measures \u2013 but nothing at all about a national integrity commission, which would grapple with integrity at the national level and across government. When it comes to welfare recipients, you might observe that these phoney tough guys are all about ensuring integrity. When it comes to the union movement, they love to talk about integrity, but if they\u2019re putting their own house in order you\u2019d be left wanting.\u201d Federal Liberal party vice president Karina Okotel spoke on the allegations raised in Eryk Bagshaw\u2019s story this morning while on Sky. She says there does need to be proper processes put in place. My eye twitched just writing the words \u201csection 44\u201d. Michael Staindl, a constituent of Josh Frydenberg in Kooyong, has launched a section 44(1) case against the deputy Liberal leader and treasurer in the court of disputed returns. A spokesman for the court told Guardian Australia the petition was filed today, the last day for such applications. Staindl has confirmed the challenge, explaining that it queries whether Frydenberg has Hungarian citizenship by descent. Staindl said: The long and the short of it is: I\u2019ve known Josh for many years. I\u2019ve been trying to get action on climate change and he makes you feel well heard but I think he\u2019s consistently betrayed me, the electorate and the country on climate change. In the last parliament he gave assurances [of action on the issue] that weren\u2019t convincing to me at all. And as our legislator I think he owes us better integrity than that. He should show us he\u2019s entitled to sit. He might well be, but he\u2019d be stupid if he hasn\u2019t renounced citizenship or can\u2019t prove he [holds only Australian citizenship].\u201d Frydenberg has previously rejected the claim of dual citizenship, arguing: \u201cIt is absurd to think that I could involuntarily acquire citizenship of a foreign country from a stateless mother and grandparents \u2013 it invokes the North Korean example of conferring citizenship on someone against their will.\u201d Under Hungarian law, anyone born in the country between 1941 and 1945 is automatically a citizen, in a bid to address the plight of stateless Jews who fled the Holocaust. Earlier this month a Victorian lawyer, Trevor Poulton \u2013 who has written a novel called The Holocaust Denier \u2013 said he was considering such a challenge, but it appears not to have materialised. Staindl said he noted \u201cwith great alarm and grief that whenever this issue is raised [Frydenberg] raised the Holocaust denier cannons and fires in every direction\u201d. \u201cThis has nothing to do with denial of the Holocaust; it is simply a matter of whether he is an Australian citizen only.\u201d Staindl said if Frydenberg shows evidence he is not Hungarian he could drop the case \u201cotherwise, yes, I\u2019ll see it through\u201d. The CPAC organisers have responded to Kristina Keneally\u2019s Senate speech, calling for some of the speakers to be banned for hate speech. The headlines, in bold, are theirs: REMARKABLE ALLEGATIONS Last night senator Kristina Keneally launched an extraordinary attack in parliament against the inaugural Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Sydney next week. In a remarkable display of twisted logic, she claimed that conference speakers British political commentator and Muslim, Raheem Kassam, was Islamophobic and that Indigenous conservatives Warren Mundine and Jacinta Price were racist. VISA BAN She called on minister Peter Dutton to reject any visa application by Mr Kassam to visit Australia. Raheem Kassam is a Brexiteer and popular commentator and is attending and speaking alongside the head of the UK Brexit party, Nigel Farage. CPAC is proud to bring Raheem Kassam to Australia and rejects senator Keneally\u2019s embarrassing attempt to shut down political opponents. Australia is a country with a long history of free speech, something authoritarian hard left opponents such as senator Keneally seek to change simply because they sometimes do not like what their opponents might say. GUILT BY ASSOCIATION Ms Keneally cast aspersions on other speakers and attendees of CPAC including senator Amanda Stoker and Craig Kelly MP, by using the underhanded tactic of \u201cguilt by association\u201d. The implication of her attack is that speaking at the same event as those she basely accuses of racism is an endorsement of such views. Ms Keneally went so far as to describe the CPAC event as a \u201ctalkfest of hate\u201d, a ludicrous accusation that merely makes use of the kind of language that is used to shut down healthy debate \u2013 a fundamental component of a liberal democracy and a free society. She also describes the speaker list as a \u201cwho\u2019s who of right-wing extremism\u201d, a claim that is objectively false. CPAC organisers, the nonprofit LibertyWorks and the American Conservative Union, view these accusations as a clear indication that CPAC Australia conference is viewed by some as a threat to Ms Keneally\u2019s handlers in the Labor party.\u201d *end statement* Jason Clare was also talking about this on Sky this morning. But here is Labor\u2019s official response to the Newstart figures which came out today, from Brendan O\u2019Connor\u2019s office: The government\u2019s attack on job seekers is a blatant attempt to distract from the division within the government over raising the rate of Newstart. Everyone other than this government knows the current labour market system must work better, connecting unemployed Australians with decent, stable jobs. Publicly shaming people struggling day by day is not helping them get in to work. Labour market programs should be geared to making people more work-ready, help them get the skills they need, and help them to get a secure, decent job. The government is not getting people into work, failing to even respond to the Jobactive Senate inquiry, which reported in February this year. Labor believes in mutual obligation arrangements for jobseekers, but that means the government has an obligation to ensure that the job active service is value for money. Rather than simply attacking people struggling to get work in order to distract from their own internal division, the government should help people to get decent, secure work.\u201d Michaelia Cash\u2019s office just put out the transcript of an interview she had with 2GB this morning, about Newstart and Jobactive and how the jobs are out there. After a few minutes of just how many jobs are out there, in places like Kalgoorlie and Townsville, there was this exchange with a caller: Barbara: I\u2019m good. Michaelia, I\u2019ve just turned 65. When you turn 65, you get no help whatsoever from any provider. I look for a job every single day, have done for the last three years. I get no response from any employer from my applications, and I try my hardest to get a job. You want us to work till we\u2019re 70 but I cannot get a job. Even those over 50 I speak to cannot get a job. Cash: Barbara, absolutely we need to \u2013 if you want to work, we, as a government, need to ensure that we can find a job for you. What I will do is, offline we\u2019ll take your details and we\u2019ll get someone to contact you and have a chat.\u201d I\u2019m sure Barbara and those she knows can just move though, right? Thank you to the readers for pointing out that Mitch Fifield is off to the UN, not the US (although he will be based in New York). Post amended. Mark Dreyfus is standing up in the House talking on the government\u2019s ensuring integrity bill (short title: unions are terrible, probably) and using it as an opportunity to talk about Angus Taylor and the need for a federal Icac. Dreyfus\u2019s main point is that the government wants integrity for unions but not when it comes to themself. \u201cThey are so allergic to ensuring integrity in their own ranks, they can\u2019t even bring themselves to talk about an election commitment that they made, which was to bring a national integrity commission [to the parliament],\u201d he said. Kevin Andrews, who is sitting in the Speaker\u2019s chair, is not having a good time, insisting Dreyfus stick to what is relevant to the legislation. The crossbench has put forward its federal anti-corruption agency demands. Paul Karp was at the press conference and will bring you something on that very soon. In the meantime, here is what the crossbench members and the Australia Institute have to say: Integrity and accountability are critical features of a healthy democracy. Without a federal integrity commission with teeth, public trust and confidence in our federal parliament will continue eroding,\u201d said David Harper AM, former Victorian supreme court judge and member of the Australia Institute national integrity committee. Centre Alliance crossbench MP Rebekha Sharkie said independents and minor party members wanted the 46th parliament to establish a transparent, publicly accessible and properly resourced agency that could do the job the Australian people expected it to do. \u201cThis is a once in a generation opportunity so let\u2019s do it once and let\u2019s do it right,\u201d said Sharkie, member for Mayo. \u201cThis is such an important area of public policy but the government is ignoring it,\u201d said senator Rex Patrick, Centre Alliance. \u201cI will introduce legislation for an Icac with teeth. The latest Crown saga reinforces the need for a real Icac,\u201d said Adam Bandt, Greens member for Melbourne. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgent need for a national integrity commission and not the woefully inadequate model the government has put forward. The community is sick and tired of dodgy behaviour in Canberra. They want to see real action to tackle corruption \u2013 not just a pretence or half-baked measures,\u201d said Andrew Wilkie, independent member for Clark. \u201cAustralians have an expectation that the parliament and public service meet the highest standards of integrity. We urgently need an effective, national anti-corruption body that is independent, well-resourced and with broad jurisdiction. It\u2019s time for transparency and accountability,\u201d said Zali Steggall, independent member for Warringah. \u201cAustralians\u2019 trust in parliament is very low. I will work with my crossbench colleagues in the House and Senate for the establishment of a fully resourced commission that has independent authority to investigate, to hold public hearings, to deal effectively with political and public sector misconduct and corruption and to publish its findings. This is a clear way forward to restore trust in our Parliament,\u201dsaid Helen Haines, independent member for Indi. \u201cThe parliament is less than four weeks old and already we have seen four cases that would have been referred to a federal Icac, and according to the government there\u2019s nothing to see here? It\u2019s disgraceful. We need to get the dirty money out of politics and a federal Icac with teeth is the way to do it,\u201d said senator Jacqui Lambie, independent senator for Tasmania. The Australia Institute national integrity committee of retired judges has put forward a design blueprint and implementation plan for any national integrity commission. Just checking the receipts. One of the people mentioned in Kristina Keneally\u2019s speech to the Senate last night has responded: Michaelia Cash says she is just delivering \u201cfactual information\u201d to the Australian people. Here is some other \u201cfactual information\u201d. Michaelia Cash has defended the timing of her \u201cI\u2019m not saying they are dole bludgers, but here are the numbers of people bludging on the dole\u201d when talking to Sunrise this morning: I am from the side of politics, people are allowed to have an opinion. The prime minister has made it very clear we make no excuses as a government for getting people off welfare and into work. That is our commitment to the Australian people. We are a job-creating government; we are elected to create more jobs which we will do. And our focus is ensuring people are safe. No one has said it would be easy to live on Newstart. The focus of this government is getting you off welfare and into work so that you have a job. The best form ... David, you know this, all of the work you do with small businesses, you know the best form of welfare is a job. This government unashamedly, we will focus to get out of the welfare system and into sustainable employment.\u201d Brett Mason from SBS was kind enough to play me the audio of that doorstop with David Gillespie. Here is how the conversation went down: Reporter: Do you have concerns about how the Liberal party handles allegations of harassment and sexual assault? Gillespie: I don\u2019t know how they handle it. I am in the National party. Reporter: The Coalition in a sense \u2026 Is the Coalition a welcoming place for women? Gillespie: Of course it is, yeah. Reporter: How so? Why? Gillespie: It\u2019s a bit confected. The Coalition is a very welcoming place for women in general. Women politicians in the National party \u2013 we just had three women elected \u2013 and similarly in the Liberal party, there\u2019s plenty of incredibly talented women who are representing Senate position and House of Reps. It is all a bit of a beat-up, I think. Reporter: Well, what do you say to the women who have raised those allegations? Gillespie walked off. \u201cA bit of a beat-up,\u201d says Coalition male MP about whether the Coalition is a welcoming place for women on the day two female Coalition staffers talk about their treatment within the party. The bells are ringing \u2013 which means parliament is about to start. I am already on my fourth coffee, so this is going to be *fun*. *not at all fun We are also talking about abuses of metadata access today because, butter me up and call me milk arrowroot, it turns out that everything people said would happen has happened and the powers aren\u2019t being used as they are meant to be. Paul Karp has done quite a bit of reporting on this lately. The Oz has picked it up today as well. Bill Shorten is also continuing to lead Labor\u2019s attack on robodebt. Following a litany of high profile bungles, Stuart Robert was forced to apologise to a mourning mother whose deceased son was the subject of robodebt hounding even after his death. When the minister was asked how many robodebt notices had turned out to be wrong, he responded: \u201cOf the 800,000 income compliance reviews since 1 July 2016 that have been finalised, 80% have resulted in a debt being collected.\u201d He would not say how many of that 80% had erroneous debt claims reduced. But that still leaves 20% \u2013 or 160,000 debts \u2013 that the minister has confirmed the government got wrong. Mr Robert does appear to have seen the error of his ways when grilled about his false claim on the 7.30 Report that robodebts were not being claimed that were older than seven years. He changed position, stating \u201cas at today\u201d robodebt hounding of historical debts before the 2013-14 financial year would not occur. The question remains: what happens to the people like 82-year-old Canberra woman Wilma Spence who have already been hit with notices for alleged debts big and small dating back to the 1990s? The robodebt farce needs to be addressed, not denied. We support legitimate debt recovery but not for inaccurate debts and not without human oversight. Time\u2019s up for this harsh and inaccurate system. The government needs to go back to the drawing board.\u201d Labor only explicitly said robodebt needed to be scrapped after the election. The push for a proper federal integrity commission from the crossbench is getting serious. The group are speaking today, to discuss what they believe is necessary to bring trust back into the federal political system. From their alert: Crossbench MPs have joined with eminent retired judges and corruption fighters to call for the government to legislate for a national integrity commission \u2013 but one that has real teeth. Who: The Hon David Harper AM, former Victorian supreme court judge Rebekha Sharkie, member for Mayo Andrew Wilkie, member for Clark Adam Bandt, member for Melbourne Helen Haines, member for Indi Zali Steggall OAM, member for Warringah Jacqui Lambie, senator for Tasmania That\u2019ll be held at 10.45 this morning. Michaelia Cash, fresh from releasing stats on Newstart recipients who hadn\u2019t met their mutual obligations, just randomly and at a completely coincidental time to when the push is on to raise the payment, was asked about assault claims raised by Liberal staffers in Eyrk Bagshaw\u2019s story. She said: These are serious allegations and I would say to the parties concerned that they should be referred to the appropriate authorities. Asked if the Liberal party had a problem with women, she had this to say: No, and our record in particular in regards to participation and employment shows that. Ahhhh, still getting in the talking point. What a trooper. In regards to the appropriate authorities comment, Kathryn Greiner, a key and influential member of the Liberal party, had this to say on RN: What did we get out of the royal commission? It starts at the top. That is what I am on about. If we want to bring transformative, conclusive change into the Liberal party, which we clearly need to do, then it starts with the prime minister. And saying to women, \u2018Go to the police,\u2019 is simply another way of shutting people up, so it\u2019s not good enough. And to my view, the Liberal party has got a cultural issue and it needs to address it.\u201d Greiner spoke to Bagshaw for a story a little earlier: Ms Greiner said the Liberal party organisation was less female-friendly than during the 1980s and \u2018had not kept pace\u2019 with broader society. \u201cYoung men in particular, with very little experience of the real world, they are on the up, and they will knock over anyone who gets in their way,\u201d Ms Greiner said in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. Andrew Wilkie had a chat to ABC Breakfast this morning about the need for a federal Icac: I\u2019m confident more whistleblowers will emerge with more stories, adding to the pressure both on the federal government but also the Victorian government. This gives impetus to the push for a federal anti-corruption agency. Some allegations are not necessarily of criminal behaviour, especially in the case of serving politicians but they go to whether behaviour is occurring which might be quite improper, so it might not be criminal but would be in the remit of an effective anti-corruption body so you will see a renewed push by the crossbench. The federal government did go to the recent election with a commitment to establish some corruption body but, you know, many of us had concerns that it would be a relatively ineffective organisation. It\u2019s something with real teeth, not unlike the anti-corruption body in New South Wales which I know has the Icac. There are people who criticise that, but we can remedy the things that are criticised and come up with a really effective federal body.\u201d Mitch Fifield also delivered his valedictory. He\u2019s off to the UN as our ambassador. Fifield left with this final message for his colleagues: If I could, I would leave a few messages as I depart. Firstly, the ordinary norms of human engagement should apply in politics. Too often in our business they\u2019re left at the door. You can\u2019t have as your starting point where you want someone to be or where you think they should be. You\u2019ve got to have as your starting point where they are, respect that and then work back from there. When you do that, you can get good outcomes. Secondly, there are some commentators whose thesis is that the system of politics in Australia is broken, that it\u2019s not possible to achieve reform any more and that the press, the 24/7 media cycle, hung chambers and new quasipolitical groups make it all too hard. I could not disagree more. How challenges manifest themselves certainly changes, but the essence of politics is the same. Our core business is advocacy. Our core business is persuasion: to stake out some territory on an issue, to make a case, to argue it and to carry people along with you. The extent to which political practitioners fail to achieve their objectives is a failure of persuasion and of advocacy. So I encourage all my colleagues to reject the thesis that the system is broken and to embrace core business.\u201d Which is a good message. If we ignore Fifield\u2019s role in helping to bring down two prime ministers, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, which only helped to cement the thesis that the system is broken. But hey, he also sang Ita. Amanda Stoker thanked Kristina Keneally for her contribution. And Keneally finished her Senate speech with this: I would like to know if senator Stoker is comfortable sharing the stage with these people. If senator Stoker cancelled her CPAC appearance it would not be the first time she has withdrawn from such a commitment. In May, during the federal election, the senator was billed to join the Sunshine Coast Safe Communities group. Much like CPAC, it is innocent by name but not by nature. They describe Muslims as \u2018incompatible people\u2019 and Islam as \u2018the destroyer of multiculturalism\u2019. The senator did cancel because she had the flu. I wouldn\u2019t fault her for cancelling her appearance at CPAC. I would say that it would take a lot more than the flu to keep the member for Hughes off the stage. This is a test for the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Is he comfortable with his members of parliament sharing the stage with people like this? Will the prime minister direct them not to attend? Will he step in and show leadership? In John Howard\u2019s time the Liberal party was a broad church but, boy, are the sands shifting now. This is not political activism; this is the normalisation of extreme right wing in Australia. And why is Nick Cater from the Menzies Institute allowing a once-reputable institution to be behind this ugly intolerance? Australians will be uncomfortable with this. The question is: who in the Liberal party will stand up? Will it be the prime minister? Will it be the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg? Will it be the attorney general, Christian Porter? Senator Payne and senator Birmingham: are they comfortable with this type of conference and their colleagues standing up? I can\u2019t speak for Robert Menzies but I have to think that the founder of the Liberal party would be turning in his grave at what this party and the institute in his name have become.\u201d In her speech to the Senate, Keneally continued: The speakers at CPAC and their views don\u2019t stop there. US congressman Mark Meadows is taking the stage. He has advocated conspiracy theories about US President Barack Obama being born in Kenya and in 2012 he vowed to send the then president home to Kenya. Those were his words \u2013 \u201cI will send the President home to Kenya.\u201d The congressman opposes any restrictions on gun purchases and opposes gun registries that would list detailed information about firearm ownership. Late last year Mr Meadows, the US congressman, was fined $40,000 for failing to deal with sexual harassment allegations in his office. He was also recently accused of using an African American public servant as a racist prop. Yes, he\u2019s slated for speaking at Cpac. US congressman Matt Gaetz is also welcome at Cpac. He is best known for inviting Holocaust denier Charles C Johnson to the 2018 state of the union address in the United States. The person Gaetz invited, Johnson, was permanently banned from Twitter in 2015 after asking for help \u201ctaking out\u201d a Black Lives Matter activist. In 2017 he denied that over 6 million Jewish people were killed in the Holocaust. Congressman Gaetz apologised later for providing the ticket to Mr Johnson. To quote the US lawmaker, he said, \u201cMr Johnson showed up at my door.\u201d Apparently you just have to show up at the congressman\u2019s door and you get to go to the state of the union address. At the same time, Congressman Gaetz insisted that Johnson was not a Holocaust denier \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s not a white supremacist.\u201d How does he know, if he just showed up at his door? For heaven\u2019s sake. These are the people. Congressman Gaetz is also currently under investigation by the House ethics committee in the US for intimidating a witness. He\u2019s a lifetime member of the NRA \u2013 a commonality for these speakers \u2013 and says that the open carrying of weapons is a right granted not by government but by God. These are the people attending this event and speaking at it. Kristina Keneally also called in parliament for Peter Dutton to step in and ban one of the speaker\u2019s from entering the country, for hate speech: Let\u2019s start with Raheem Kassam, one of the headline speakers at Cpac. Mr Kassam is described as \u201ca British political activist\u201d according to Cpac\u2019s website. However, the organisers of the event chose to omit the details of what Mr Kassam thinks being an activist is. Mr Kassam has an extensive history of vilifying people on the grounds of their race, religion, sexuality and gender. He has described the Qur\u2019an, the holy book of the Muslim faith, as \u201cfundamentally evil\u201d. Mr Kassam has campaigned for \u201climited migration\u201d against what he describes as \u201clarge-scale Muslim immigration\u201d. He has regularly attacked the LGBTI community with homophobic and transphobic comments on social media. And, there\u2019s this one: after the Scottish National party leader Nicola Sturgeon suffered a miscarriage, Mr Kassam tweeted: Can someone just, like \u2026 tape Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s mouth shut? And her legs, so she can\u2019t reproduce. The question is simple: why is the home affairs minister allowing this individual into the country? Section 501 of the Migration Act exists so that the minister has the power to refuse the visa of an individual of such a character. The minister can refuse a visa if there is a significant risk that an individual would \u201cvilify a segment of the Australian community\u201d, \u201cincite discord\u201d or \u201crepresent danger\u201d to them during their time in Australia. We should not allow a career bigot \u2013 a person who spreads hate speech about Muslims, about women and about gay and lesbian people \u2013to enter our country with the express intent of undermining equity and equality. If the home affairs minister allows Raheem Kassam into the country, he is encouraging a cavalcade of intolerance to continue at Cpac\u2019s talkfest of hate. Another speaker taking to the stage is Matt Schlapp. He is chair of the American Conservative Union, the people behind the event. He is a self-described \u201clover\u201d of the National Rifle Association. He has defended the chief of the NRA for saying, \u201cPeople who want gun control hate freedom.\u201d Mr Schlapp said that, having a Republican politician of colour in the role of chairman of the Republican national convention in the United States was \u201cthe wrong thing to do\u201d. Regrettably, that is not Mr Schlapp\u2019s only instance of racist dog whistling. This is yet another speaker those opposite are willing to share a stage with. Reading through the Hansard last night, and it seems Kristina Keneally had a bit to say about the Cpac conference coming to Australia next month. It\u2019s like conservative Christmas, where people who have been in power for a really, really long time, blame all of society\u2019s problems on people who have not been in power. Sort of how I imagine the Monkeypod lunches went down. Keneally delivered this speech while Amanda Stoker was in the president\u2019s chair, so you know, it certainly was direct. I have always welcomed political debate; I have chosen a career where I get to engage with people who hold different views to me, such as Senator McGrath. However, there is a difference between engaging in political debate and spewing vitriolic bile. There is a difference between meeting up at a political conference and associating with racists. And there is a difference between listening to political leaders and influencers and giving a platform to hate speech. Whilst Cpac may have an innocent name, it definitely is not innocent by nature. I\u2019d like to highlight that both the member for Hughes, Craig Kelly, and our senator from this place Amanda Stoker, the Liberal senator, are scheduled to be speaking at this event. Now I also note Warren Mundine \u2013 who the prime minister handpicked to be the Liberal candidate in Gilmore \u2013 is attending and speaking, along with the Liberal candidate Jacinta Price. That is their prerogative if they would like to do that but I would like to bring to the Senate\u2019s attention the company these Liberal members of parliament will be keeping, associating with, and sharing a stage with next week. The speakers list is a who\u2019s who of rightwing extremism, with numerous guests having long records of attacks on women, on gay and lesbian people, on Islam, as well as having links to antisemitism. The new Labor senator Tim Ayres used his first speech in parliament to respond to Scott Morrison\u2019s latest invocation of the phrase \u201cunfunded empathy\u201d (he\u2019s used it a few times in the past, from at least 2015 onwards). I\u2019m proud to raise that. Yesterday the prime minister described raising Newstart as unfunded empathy. The grotesque, cowardly and dishonest comment. It\u2019s an insult to the 1 million Australians trapped in poverty and unemployment by the current rate. This raises unfunded only because his government refuses to fund it, presumably to defend his own surplus. It reveals a deeper, darker malice, a cruel pea-part beats inside the chest of this mean-spirited government. Labor has only recently openly and publicly called for Newstart to be raised, having hesitated before the election and committing to only reviewing it. That left the Coalition with plenty of room to move \u2013 it didn\u2019t even commit to reviewing it, because, well, it didn\u2019t have to. Labor\u2019s change of heart has now led to a Senate inquiry being set up to review the payment, to investigate by how much it should increase, and the cost to the budget. At the moment, the only side in the parliament not supportive of raising Newstart, or even reviewing it, is the Coalition. There are some outliers, but it is government policy to not touch it. Because it\u2019s too expensive. And it\u2019s not meant to be a substitute for a job. But no one says it is. And living on $350 a week is not exactly living large. But it might make the difference between eating or not. Or being able to get a bus ticket to get to that job interview or not. If anyone thinks that $350 a week is overly generous, well, I suggest you try it. We are at the halfway point for the sitting \u2013 it is all downhill from here. Thank Rihanna. Once again, it is not legislation we are talking about. Eryk Bagshaw from the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age published this story overnight, which once again has focused attention on the culture within the Liberal party. There are, by my count, three reviews under way within the Liberal party at a state and federal level on how to bring more women into the party. There was, after the leadership spill, also a massive push, led by Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, to install a formal complaints process within the federal party. Since then, the party has once again closed ranks, repeatedly assuring those who ask that processes are in place and everything is fine. But this story is bound to put those uncomfortable questions back into the spotlight. Speaking of uncomfortable questions, the Crossbench Five are getting louder in their calls for a federal Icac, after both Labor and the Coalition voted against a parliamentary inquiry into the Crown allegations and possible involvement of former and current parliamentarians. The government referred the allegations to the law enforcement integrity commission, which it, and Labor used as the reason it was rejecting a parliamentary inquiry push. But the commission has no powers to investigate parliamentarians, which is why the crossbench are once again pushing for a federal integrity commission to deal with these issues. Before the election Christian Porter promised to install a commission. But it was seen by critics as being too limited, given that anyone before the commission would have their cases heard behind closed doors, with no one able to report on any investigation until any future court cases had concluded \u2013 and only then, when someone had been found guilty. Given how much the NSW Icac has uncovered from public hearings, that, understandably, had people upset. We haven\u2019t seen much move on that since the election, and the crossbench appear to have lost patience. Oh, and the issue of Newstart just won\u2019t go away, so suddenly we see the release of figures on the number of people who have missed their \u201cmutual obligations\u201d (jobseeker meetings) from the government. DEIDRE CHAMBERS. Michaelia Cash had this to say: The Coalition takes the mutual obligation of welfare recipients very seriously. When participants have their payments suspended up to 52 times in less than a year, they are not living up to what the taxpayer expects who are giving their hard-earned money to the government. I mean, she didn\u2019t say the words \u201cdole bludger\u201d but she hopes you get the gist. Anyone who has had to deal with Jobactive services knows that these aren\u2019t always the most positive of experiences. Plus, we have seen increasing numbers of people who had been on disability payments moved to Newstart \u2013 while still struggling with the health issues which kept them away from work in the first place \u2013 with all the obligations that come with it. But hey, what\u2019s a chronic health problem when you have a box to tick for the government? We\u2019ll bring you all of that, and more. You\u2019ve got Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and the rest of the Guardian brains\u2019 trust \u2013 and I am at least 25% capacity, so that\u2019s exciting. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "Two recent news stories have shone a light on the revolving door between the police and the security industry. The Guardian has revealed that Crossrail employed the security company Control Risks to keep tabs on union members who were campaigning to reinstate a sacked colleague. Emails released to the electrician Frank Morris show that this monitoring involved weekly briefings on the efforts by the Blacklist Support Group and Unite the union to win Morris his job back. Both Control Risks and Crossrail have denied this was anything more than using publicly available information from social media accounts. Two former police officers who were employed by Crossrail are named in these emails. They worked in the security department of the publicly funded project. The emails show they oversaw Control Risks as it monitored the anti-blacklist campaigners. Control Risks was established in 1975 by David Walker, a former SAS officer, and Julian Radcliffe, then managing director of a political risk insurer. It is now a global operation employing thousands and has a history of recruiting former SAS and intelligence officers. There is no suggestion that the employees or Control Risks were engaged in any illegal activity or blacklisting either in their previous careers or currently. Yet time and again, when a company faces legitimate concerns about its activities, its reaction is to reach for the spies. A HM Inspectorate of Constabulary report as far back as 2012 warned of the risk of conflicts of interest if officers from units monitoring extremism transferred to the private sector and then attempted to make use of their old contacts. Meanwhile the Met\u2019s former head of counter-terrorism, Richard Walton, popped up as the co-author of a report from the Policy Exchange thinktank into Extinction Rebellion, arguing that the protest group should be considered an extremist organisation looking to subvert democracy. \u201cThose encountering Extinction Rebellion should be under no illusions about just how destabilising and extremist their agenda is,\u201d the report declares. Walton is a senior fellow at the rightwing thinktank and also runs Counter Terrorism Global Ltd. Walton retired from the Met only days after it was found that he would have had a disciplinary case to answer for his role in spying on the Stephen Lawrence campaign. As well as the warning from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary over the private security sector, the continuing inquiry into undercover policing revealed more than 1,000 organisations have been spied upon since the 1960s. Despite the supposed checks and balances on the police, we have seen numerous covert policing scandals occur over decades. We should be concerned then about the adequacy of the barely-there safeguards and regulations in the private security industry. We should be under no illusions about the potential risks posed by former spooks passing unchecked into the private sector. \u2022 Phil Chamberlain is co-author of Blacklisted: The secret war between big business and union activists",

Finding a copy of her debut collection<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/09/fiction.roundupreviews3\" title=\"\"><em>St Lucy\u2019s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves</em></a>, which was longlisted for the 2007 Guardian first book award, I took it home on a whim. With some books you begin a relationship with an author that will continue hungrily through everything they write.

Finding a copy of her debut collection St Lucy\u2019s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves, which was longlisted for the 2007 Guardian first book award, I took it home on a whim. With some books you begin a relationship with an author that will continue hungrily through everything they write. Russell\u2019s writing inhabits its own universe, with metaphor and simile taking us to strange new places; we are led by the hand and find ourselves completely submerged, only later to come to, groggily, in our own world. In Russell\u2019s second collection, Vampires in the Lemon Grove, women are silkworms and dead presidents live in the bodies of horses. In her novel Swamplandia! the Floridian swamps teem with alligator wrestlers; in her novella Sleep Donation, sleep is a sought-after commodity. Orange World is Russell\u2019s third collection of short stories and it contains all her trademark signs of weirdness: a boy falls in love with a bog girl found preserved in the ground, a land on the watery edge of apocalypse is explored by a woman in a gondola, tornadoes are harnessed and sold at auction like cattle.

On Wednesday, the Western Australian Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development said it had charged both the company and two of its former directors with animal cruelty, under the state\u2019s Animal Welfare Act. They have been summoned to appear in court at a later date. The specific offence relates to transporting an animal \u201cin a way that causes, or is likely to cause, it unnecessary harm\u201d, and carries a maximum penalty of a $50,000 fine or five years imprisonment. The two directors, including former managing director Graham Daws, left the company last year at the same time the federal Department of Agriculture announced it was reviewing its export licence. Emanuel Exports managing director Nicholas Daws, who took over from his father Graham in June last year, said the company would \u201cvigorously defend the matter in court\u201d. The RSPCA welcomed the charges and said the alleged cruelty should not go unpunished. The investigation by the state authority began in February 2018 and was prompted by a mandatory report to the federal agriculture department, triggered by a reported mortality rate of 3.76% of the stock on board. The trigger point for a mandatory mortality report is 2%. Two months later, the federal government called for an urgent review of the heat stress standards and the regulatory culture of the federal agriculture department. It placed a three-month moratorium on exporting to the Middle East during the northern hemisphere summer this year. The department confirmed on Wednesday that the moratorium would be extended to 22 September, and that once trade resumed, shipments through the Middle East would be required to submit a heat stress management plan, adhere to new lower stocking densities, and automatically collect on-deck temperatures to send to the department. The federal government also required an independent observer be placed on all live export ships to the Middle East, although the bulk of those reports are yet to be released. WA agriculture minister, Alannah MacTiernan, warned exporters in 2017, following the death of more than 3,000 sheep on the Emanuel Exports ship Al Messilah, that the state government could prosecute live exporters under its own animal welfare laws and would do so if another mass-mortality event occurred. She dismissed an accusation from the farming lobby that the charges were the result of her own personal vendetta against the company, telling Guardian Australia that incidents like the Awassi voyage \u201cdamages the whole livestock industry, not just live export\u201d. \u201cIt damages Australian agriculture,\u201d she said.",

A club run on a tight budget could not afford to bulk out the squad to cope with extra fixtures in Europe, particularly as Burnley would not know whether they won through to the competition proper until after the transfer deadline. In the event Burnley gave a reasonable account of themselves in qualifying rounds against Aberdeen and Istanbul Basaksehir, before going out to Olympiakos in the play-off round.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/22/sean-dyche-interview-alastair-campbell\">Sean Dyche: 'You're constantly looking for the X factor, that mystical ingredient' | Alastair Campbell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That meant Burnley\u2019s first European adventure in half a century was short and sweet and over by the end of August. As they had lost two of their first three league fixtures by that stage no one was unduly concerned about a truncated Europa League campaign, though Dyche believes the effect of starting the season early and playing six more competitive matches than their Premier League rivals was an energy drain that began to resolve itself only around Christmas.</p> \n<p>Certainly Burnley were barely recognisable as their usual doughty selves in the first half of the season. Their first five games yielded a single point, and after Everton inflicted a 5-1 defeat at Turf Moor on Boxing Day Burnley ended the calendar year in a relegation position. That proved a turning point, however, for with Joe Hart dropped in favour of a return for the former goalkeeping favourite Tom Heaton, Burnley took 18 points from their next eight games to begin the climb out of trouble. There was still the odd scare before the end of the season but the settled side and familiar tenacity that had served the club so well in the past were on show as Burnley made sure of survival with a few games to spare.</p> \n<p>So the question for the coming season is which Burnley are we going to see? The manager has not changed and essentially the team is just the same as before. Sam Vokes dropped down to the Championship with Stoke midway through last season and has been replaced by the long-term Dyche target Jay Rodriguez, while the experienced Erik Pieters has been picked up from Stoke as left-back cover for Charlie Taylor. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/12/peter-crouch-football-nation-england-robot\">Peter Crouch has retired</a>, though as he barely featured in starting lineups last season he is hardly going to be missed.</p> \n<p>One player who would be missed is Dwight McNeil, the 19-year-old winger who made such a breakthrough last season he found himself training with England and attracting attention from Tottenham and Juventus. Dyche and the Turf Moor crowd can probably accept he will be moving onwards and upwards at some point, but would ideally like another season or two from him first. Rejected by Manchester United aged 14, McNeil took the opportunity to sign academy forms at Burnley and looks good enough to perform at the highest level.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/burnley-zip/giv-3902q66fK3iBFhlh/\" data-alt=\"Past five seasons\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/burnley-zip/giv-3902q66fK3iBFhlh/\">Past five seasons</a> \n</figure> \n<p>He has all the pace a winger needs coupled with an appetite for taking on defenders and a willingness to track back when necessary, but what will make it difficult for Aaron Lennon to win his place back in the side is McNeil\u2019s delivery. This is a winger with an end product, an aptitude for the early cross and even an eye for goal. Dyche did not just bring back Heaton after the Everton defeat, he promoted McNeil following a handful of Europa League outings and was rewarded with a winning goal in the next game against West Ham.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/burnley-zip/giv-39028i9qwYcywsX8/\" data-alt=\"Last season's results\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/burnley-zip/giv-39028i9qwYcywsX8/\">Last season's results</a> \n</figure> \n<p>With their smallish squad and the manager\u2019s preference for retaining a settled side Burnley are one of the clubs who will be happy to see each transfer window close. Heaton has been attracting interest from Aston Villa and though Dyche has other goalkeeping options, Burnley would have to move fast if a sizeable bid came in for McNeil, or for James Tarkowski in the event of Harry Maguire\u2019s departure from Leicester triggering a sudden demand for replacement centre-halves.</p> \n<p>Essentially, however, the Burnley blueprint will not change. Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood up front will be expected to provide the goals, with Rodriguez to provide assistance and variation, and though Burnley can play through midfield with the ball on the floor the overall plan will continue to be hitting the big lads up front as quickly as possible. It is not a complicated philosophy, but as countless opposition managers have remarked in the last couple of years, just because you know what Burnley are going to do does not make it any easier to stop them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"68bc874c-c080-4efb-98c1-cd42665645cc\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>No 1:</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-2019-20-preview-arsenal-unai-emery-champions-league-pepe\">Arsenal</a><br><b>No 2:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-201920-preview-no-2-aston-villa\">Aston Villa</a><br><b>No 3:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/premier-league-2019-20-preview-bournemouth-eddie-howe\">Bournemouth</a><br><b>No 4:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/premier-league-201920-preview-no-4-brighton\">Brighton</a><br><b>No 5:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/premier-league-201920-preview-no-5-burnley\">Burnley</a><br><b>No 6:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/premier-league-201920-preview-no-6-chelsea\">Chelsea</a><br><b>No 7:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-2019-20-preview-crystal-palace-hodgson-zaha\">Crystal Palace</a><br><b>No 8:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-201920-preview-no-8-everton\">Everton</a><br><b>No 9:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-2019-20-preview-leicester-brendan-rodgers-perez-tielemans\">Leicester City</a><br><b>No 10:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-201920-preview-no-10-liverpool\">Liverpool</a><br><b>No 11:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/premier-league-201920-preview-no-11-manchester-city\">Manchester City</a><br><b>No 12:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/premier-league-201920-preview-no-12-manchester-united\">Manchester United</a><br><b>No 13:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/premier-league-201920-preview-no-13-newcastle-united\">Newcastle United</a><br><b>No 14:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/premier-league-201920-preview-no-14-norwich-city\">Norwich City</a><br><b>No 15:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/premier-league-201920-preview-no-15-sheffield-united\">Sheffield United</a><br><b>No 16:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/premier-league-201920-preview-no-16-southampton\">Southampton</a><br><b>No 17:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/premier-league-201920-preview-no-17-tottenham\">Tottenham Hotspur</a><br><b>No 18:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/premier-league-201920-preview-no-18-watford\">Watford</a><br><b>No 19:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/premier-league-201920-preview-no-19-west-ham\">West Ham</a><br><b>No 20:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/premier-league-201920-preview-no-20-wolves\">Wolves</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Wood may look ponderous but he has grown into the side and the Premier League to become an effective performer. Barnes is simply one of the most consistent attackers in the top flight, and one of the most consistently underrated.

      "bodyText": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position: 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Paul Wilson\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips) Last season\u2019s position: 15th Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 1,500-1 Burnley finished 15th last season, which is roughly what most people would have expected and would have represented their highest Premier League placing but for the extraordinary events of the season before, when the Clarets kicked off with a win at champions Chelsea and went on to reach \u201cbest of the rest\u201d billing just behind the top six. Yet claiming seventh place and a shot at the Europa League qualifiers turned out to be a mixed blessing for Sean Dyche and his players. A club run on a tight budget could not afford to bulk out the squad to cope with extra fixtures in Europe, particularly as Burnley would not know whether they won through to the competition proper until after the transfer deadline. In the event Burnley gave a reasonable account of themselves in qualifying rounds against Aberdeen and Istanbul Basaksehir, before going out to Olympiakos in the play-off round. That meant Burnley\u2019s first European adventure in half a century was short and sweet and over by the end of August. As they had lost two of their first three league fixtures by that stage no one was unduly concerned about a truncated Europa League campaign, though Dyche believes the effect of starting the season early and playing six more competitive matches than their Premier League rivals was an energy drain that began to resolve itself only around Christmas. Certainly Burnley were barely recognisable as their usual doughty selves in the first half of the season. Their first five games yielded a single point, and after Everton inflicted a 5-1 defeat at Turf Moor on Boxing Day Burnley ended the calendar year in a relegation position. That proved a turning point, however, for with Joe Hart dropped in favour of a return for the former goalkeeping favourite Tom Heaton, Burnley took 18 points from their next eight games to begin the climb out of trouble. There was still the odd scare before the end of the season but the settled side and familiar tenacity that had served the club so well in the past were on show as Burnley made sure of survival with a few games to spare. So the question for the coming season is which Burnley are we going to see? The manager has not changed and essentially the team is just the same as before. Sam Vokes dropped down to the Championship with Stoke midway through last season and has been replaced by the long-term Dyche target Jay Rodriguez, while the experienced Erik Pieters has been picked up from Stoke as left-back cover for Charlie Taylor. Peter Crouch has retired, though as he barely featured in starting lineups last season he is hardly going to be missed. One player who would be missed is Dwight McNeil, the 19-year-old winger who made such a breakthrough last season he found himself training with England and attracting attention from Tottenham and Juventus. Dyche and the Turf Moor crowd can probably accept he will be moving onwards and upwards at some point, but would ideally like another season or two from him first. Rejected by Manchester United aged 14, McNeil took the opportunity to sign academy forms at Burnley and looks good enough to perform at the highest level. He has all the pace a winger needs coupled with an appetite for taking on defenders and a willingness to track back when necessary, but what will make it difficult for Aaron Lennon to win his place back in the side is McNeil\u2019s delivery. This is a winger with an end product, an aptitude for the early cross and even an eye for goal. Dyche did not just bring back Heaton after the Everton defeat, he promoted McNeil following a handful of Europa League outings and was rewarded with a winning goal in the next game against West Ham. With their smallish squad and the manager\u2019s preference for retaining a settled side Burnley are one of the clubs who will be happy to see each transfer window close. Heaton has been attracting interest from Aston Villa and though Dyche has other goalkeeping options, Burnley would have to move fast if a sizeable bid came in for McNeil, or for James Tarkowski in the event of Harry Maguire\u2019s departure from Leicester triggering a sudden demand for replacement centre-halves. Essentially, however, the Burnley blueprint will not change. Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood up front will be expected to provide the goals, with Rodriguez to provide assistance and variation, and though Burnley can play through midfield with the ball on the floor the overall plan will continue to be hitting the big lads up front as quickly as possible. It is not a complicated philosophy, but as countless opposition managers have remarked in the last couple of years, just because you know what Burnley are going to do does not make it any easier to stop them. Wood may look ponderous but he has grown into the side and the Premier League to become an effective performer. Barnes is simply one of the most consistent attackers in the top flight, and one of the most consistently underrated. There may be quicker forwards around, deadlier finishers and more elegant players to watch, but Barnes is perfectly in tune with the way Burnley play. It is hard to imagine him playing for anyone else, just as it is becoming difficult to work out what Burnley would do without him. Dyche, asked at the beginning of last season whether Burnley could consider themselves an established Premier League side, replied: \u201cYou never know\u201d, which was a good answer considering the turbulence that was coming. Surviving a relegation scrap when it was least expected can only make the side stronger, and as long as Dyche remains in charge it is probably safe to predict another season of gradual improvement as Burnley begin their fourth Premier League campaign since winning the Championship in 2016. With their modest budget and tight-knit team Burnley may never be able to take Premier League status for granted, though they have made themselves stronger each season and have shown themselves able to deal with everything thrown at them so far. It is a delicate balancing act at Turf Moor: remove one key element from the structure and one feels the whole edifice may wobble, but until and unless that actually happens Burnley seem set to keep coming back for more.",

The myth to which his title refers is that of the frontier. Other countries have borders, Grandin writes, but \u201conly the United States has had a frontier\u201d, always shifting, and making itself \u2013 and its people \u2013 anew. For most of American history it was an ever-expanding boundary, a terrain less geographic than metaphorical and messianic. It referred at first to the landmass west of the Allegheny Mountains, then to lands west of the Mississippi River, then west of the Rocky Mountains. The frontier would cover most of the planet before it took an abstract turn and came to mean endless economic growth, the cosmos conceived as an ever-expanding market \u2013 overseen, of course, by US banks and a few fleets of aircraft carriers.</p> <p>But before it was anything else, Grandin makes clear, the frontier was a zone of genocidal violence. For the earliest settlers, America was a spiritual aspiration as much as an actual locale. The land\u2019s apparent boundlessness offered a chance at rebirth and redemption. If people lived there already, they would have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/20/california-native-americans-governor-apology-reparations\" title=\"\">to go elsewhere, or be exterminated</a>. And so they were, from the Massachusetts Bay Colony to, eventually, the Pacific. For the men who would later be mythologised as the \u201cFounding Fathers\u201d, conquest \u2013 the right of white settlers to seize whatever land they wanted \u2013 was from the start inseparable from liberty. Freedom, in the American sense of the word, was unimaginable without the frontier, limitless land for the taking just beyond the boundaries of the known.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Class conflict, again and again, would be evaded by deflecting violence outward to the frontier, and by projecting class resentments on to race</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This proved convenient in many ways. Social contradictions \u2013 between the rich and the landless, between those who believed human beings could be owned and those who disagreed \u2013 did not have to be addressed when they could be pushed ever outwards, to the west. If the young nation began to feel too crowded or tense, it could always, in the words of James Madison, \u201cexpand the sphere\u201d.

Transforming centuries of dispossession and slaughter into a font of democratic virtue, he would argue, in Grandin\u2019s paraphrasing, that the frontier\u2019s openness had \u201ccreated the conditions for an unprecedented expansion of the ideal of political equality\u201d.

The frontier was not closed but would move ever outward across the oceans. \u201cTurner\u2019s soothing processional became the official public anthem of a nation moving out into the world, not as a conquering race,\u201d Grandin writes, \u201cbut in the name of humanity.\u201d These were years of what Grandin calls \u201crelentless race terror\u201d at home \u2013 widespread lynchings of African Americans throughout the south, and of Mexicans and Mexican Americans along the southern border \u2013 matched by extraordinary and exterminatory violence abroad.

It became the place where Turner\u2019s transformative magic didn\u2019t work, \u201cthe repository of the racism and brutality that the frontier was said \u2026 to leave behind\u201d. This would at times be startlingly literal: the first real fence along the border was erected in 1945 with posts and wire repurposed from a wartime internment camp for Japanese Americans. Stretches of the border wall that went up in the 1990s were constructed with Vietnam-era helicopter landing pads that the military no longer needed. With nowhere else to go, the violence keeps on spiralling, swirling back in new but always uncannily familiar shapes.</p> <p>The frontier, Grandin argues, is finally closed. These days only arms manufacturers and the most deluded members of the populace \u2013 who find easy employment in thinktanks \u2013 see any result of US military adventurism other than endless and ever-expanding war. Few who are not economists or billionaires have faith in limitless growth. The country is no longer able to push \u201cextremism to the fringe\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Investment in Britain\u2019s car industry has effectively stopped amid fears over Brexit, with a \u201cpitiful\u201d \u00a390m pledged for new developments in the first six months of this year, according to the industry body. Before Brexit clouded the horizon, the automotive industry was investing between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a32.7bn a year in research and development. The Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders (SMMT) said a Brexit deal was imperative to help the embattled industry to bounce back, otherwise the government will face demands for the same type of tax breaks farmers need to stay afloat. The SMMT also revealed that the industry has sunk \u00a3330m into contingency plans for a no-deal. \u201cThat shows you the scale of expenditure having to be made potentially for no reason if we get a deal,\u201d said Mike Hawes, SMMT\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut the most worrying figure is investment. The fear of no deal is causing investors to sit on their hands. There is political uncertainty. There is economic uncertainty. \u201cThe worst outcome would be no deal, that\u2019s what they fear and that is why they are not investing. In terms of underlying trends, undoubtedly \u00a390m is pitiful.\u201d He added: \u201cInvestment-wise, over the last seven years we\u2019ve averaged about \u00a32.5bn to \u00a32.7bn per annum. That fall [to \u00a390m] is precipitous.\u201d The \u00a3330m on contingencies has been spent on areas including new IT systems, regulatory work on chemical storage, warehousing, stockpiling of specialised pallets for parts and insurance for extra stock. Hawes said the industry was preparing for no deal at the end of October but the shutdowns by several companies in April could \u201cnot be easily repeated\u201d. It took BMW six to nine months to plan for that, said Hawes, and it would not be repeated in November. The industry has been one of the most outspoken in the past year over Brexit, arguing a no-deal would kill the sector and more than 100,000 jobs in \u201ca death by a thousand cuts\u201d. Hawes said: \u201cWe have a new prime minister. He said the chances of no deal were a million to one, more power to his elbow. We want an ambitious deal, we need that deal, we can\u2019t have confidence in the future without confidence he can get a deal.\u201d If the UK does crash out of the EU, the car industry will look to the government for tax breaks and other support including reduced energy costs, reduced business rates, R&amp;D tax credits and enhanced capital allowances. Hawes said Jaguar Range Rover\u2019s recent announcement that it is to build an electric version of the Jaguar XJ saloon at its Castle Bromwich factory, safeguarding 2,500 jobs, was \u201crare\u201d good news, but it was an \u201coutlier\u201d and did not reflect the industry trend. A series of blows have hit the sector in recent months, with Honda announcing that it will close its Swindon factory in 2021, and Ford saying its Bridgend engine plant in South Wales will close in September 2020 with the loss of 1,700 jobs. On Monday, owner of Vauxhall, PSA, warned that the car giant will cease production at its Ellesmere Port factory if Brexit makes it unprofitable \u2013 putting 1,000 jobs in north-west England at risk. In addition to Brexit, the industry is facing a softening in global markets. New figures show car production fell by more than a fifth in the first half of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018, with demand at home and abroad falling by double digits. Manufacturing for domestic buyers has fallen by 16.4%, while overseas orders are down by 21%. Hawes said he was \u201crelatively confident\u201d the industry could bounce back if a deal is struck with the EU, as \u201cthe fundamentals\u201d \u2013 including high skilled labour force, strong brands, engineering excellence and high productivity \u2013 made the UK very competitive. If not, it would be looking for support from the government if it was to safeguard jobs. The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cThe UK automotive industry remains one of our great success stories. \u201cWe are at the forefront of designing and manufacturing cutting-edge vehicles, and we continue to talk to industry, including the automotive sector, in the run-up to exit day to ensure they are prepared and can maximise the opportunities of our exit from the EU.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The first round of the second Democratic 2020 presidential debates saw liberal firebrands Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren square off against moderate candidates on issues ranging from healthcare to race relations and Republican \u201ctalking points\u201d. In the latest stage of the race to be the party\u2019s candidate to take on Donald Trump in next year\u2019s US election, Sanders and Warren were joined by the rising stars South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, as well as a range of lesser-known Democrats angling to make a splash on the national stage. Here are the key takeaways from Tuesday night: Progressives v moderates Sanders and Warren have made an indelible impact in defining the Democratic party\u2019s progressive flank, and they dominated the debate on Tuesday, not just in terms of air time. Much of the 2020 Democratic field has rallied behind Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All healthcare proposal, which would revolutionize the US healthcare system and in effect eliminate private medical insurance, while Warren\u2019s ideas to break up big banks and impose a wealth tax on the top 75,000 ultra-rich families in the country are no longer seen as outliers. The moderates nonetheless fought back on Tuesday, warning that Democrats were risking their chances of taking back the White House from Trump in 2020 by promoting policies that might be too radical for the American public. John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman, said proposals such as Medicare forAll were nothing short of \u201cimpossible promises\u201d for \u201cmore free stuff\u201d. Montana\u2019s governor, Steve Bullock, appearing in his first debate, likened the Sanders-Warren agenda to \u201cwishlist economics\u201d. Amy Klobuchar, who serves alongside Warren and Sanders in the US Senate, repeatedly called for ideas that were \u201cgrounded in reality\u201d. Despite the efforts by moderates to undercut the progressive tide, it was still Warren and Sanders who earned the most positive reception from the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness,\u201d said Warren, who also drew cheers for stating that candidates should not run on what they can\u2019t do. Deep divisions on healthcare laid bare Medicare for All, the single-payer healthcare proposal crafted by Sanders, was a focal point of the debate from the outset. Several Democratic 2020 contenders have signed on to Sanders\u2019 plan but candidates have waffled on how far they are willing to go when pressed on what Medicare for All would actually mean for the healthcare industry. On Tuesday, moderates such as Delaney, Bullock and the Ohio representative Tim Ryan attacked Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All vision as unrealistic and politically and financially risky. \u201cWe can go down the road that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren want to take us, which is with bad policies like Medicare for All, free everything, and impossible promises that will turn off independent voters and get Trump re-elected,\u201d Delaney said.

      "bodyText": "A Townsville woman has been hit with a $2,000 robodebt, despite the government\u2019s repeated claims that Centrelink staff had not lifted a \u201cquarantine\u201d on welfare compliance in the flood-affected town. On Tuesday the government services minister, Stuart Robert, issued a statement decrying \u201cfalse rumours of debt notices\u201d and saying \u201cthere is currently no debt recovery for income compliance in the four affected postcodes in the Townsville region\u201d. Questioned in the Senate last week, the social services minister, Anne Ruston, also repeatedly denied reports in Guardian Australia that Centrelink staff had been told to recommence debt compliance in the town. On Wednesday, the Queensland Labor senator Nita Green sought to table the Townsville woman\u2019s debt notice in the Senate. Green, and Labor\u2019s government services minister, Bill Shorten, said the debt was worth about $2,000, though the value is redacted. The debt notice was issued on 8 July and is titled: \u201cAccount Payable\u201d. It states that the money is due on 6 August and is addressed to a Townsville postcode. Ruston told the Senate she would look into the debt notice but expressed \u201cextreme disappointment\u201d the letter was not raised with her privately. Shorten questioned Robert on his previous statements saying debt recovery was not being undertaken in Townsville. \u201cWhy was that absolute undertaking given, when people in Townsville are currently receiving debt recovery notices as recently as this month including this $2,000 robodebt issued on the 8 July?\u201d Shorten said. Robert told Parliament: \u201cAs a general rule, this suspension is in place for six months unless extended. \u201cI have asked the department to extend the absence of debt recovery in northern Queensland for the foreseeable future until I\u2019m satisfied that the region has recovered.\u201d It is unclear when Robert asked his department to extend the quarantine, but Centrelink sources told Guardian Australia that staff had been told they should recommence processing debts within several Townsville postcodes in June. The postcodes had been quarantined after February\u2019s devastating floods. Shorten said in a statement after question time: \u201cFirst Mr Robert said there was no debt compliance in the Townsville area. Now he says he\u2019s ordering it to stop. \u201cBut the robodebt demands keep rolling in to an area still recovering from a natural disaster.\u201d Michael Murray, a lawyer at the Townsville Community Legal Service, previously told Guardian Australia that some residents affected by the floods were now being drawn into the controversial debt recovery program. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people who might have lost their homes or lost their belongings or lost their jobs as a result of the floods, they\u2019re still dealing with all of that. They\u2019re also dealing with the robodebt issue as well,\u201d Murray said. The Townsville mayor, Jenny Hill, also asked the government to suspend welfare compliance in the area. On Monday night, Labor called for the robodebt program to be abolished, but the government says it has a legal obligation to recoup money that it says was overpaid. The scheme is currently the subject of a legal challenge that will go to federal court later in the year. Also on Wednesday, the Senate agreed to its second inquiry into the robodebt scheme in three years. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said the previous inquiry had called for the program to be suspended, but \u201cinstead, the government ramped it up.\u201d \u201cTo this day, people continue to be pursued,\u201d she said. \u201cI hear from so many people that they have given up appealing their debt even though they know they don\u2019t owe anything simply because they cannot keep fighting such an opaque system.\u201d Robert was contacted for comment.",

Kenya\u2019s treaty with Mauritius was recently struck down in the Nairobi High Court. Other countries are considering renegotiations. A spokesperson for 8 Miles said: \u201c8 Miles invests in African businesses to create jobs and improve communities, using high environmental, social and governance standards and generating tax revenues which support the governments where we operate. The companies we invest in pay all taxes in their home jurisdiction in Africa. Only when we sell a company will the sale proceeds be paid back into the fund in Mauritius.\u201d They added: \u201cAny double tax agreements are a matter between the governments who sign these agreements and we comply with such agreements but we do not make them.\u201d This is true, but one of the major reasons governments feel compelled to enter into tax treaties, and are reluctant to terminate those that are harmful, is their anticipation of reactions from investors. As a former negotiator from Zambia told me: \u201cThere\u2019s empirical evidence that [tax treaties] have no effect on investment, but the reality country-to-country is that there\u2019s a bluff going on, and countries don\u2019t want to take the risk of losing big investments.\u201d 8 Miles needs to bring its market power to bear, with a clear commitment to stand by countries that negotiate less damaging tax treaties, and to reconsider its reliance on Mauritius, unless the country gets its house in order. \u2022 Martin Hearson is a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, researching international tax treaties",

      "body": "<p>Since moving to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 2005, my husband Dave and I had attended almost 20 churches. One church we went to never invited us into a Bible study. When I asked a pastor or a Sunday school teacher about Wednesday night Bible studies, I was always told to ask someone else, who told me to ask someone else. This went on for five months, until one Sunday the pastor preached a sermon about the importance of small groups and said from the pulpit that all we had to do was ask to be invited. We never went back.</p> <p>Or there was the church we visited in 2006 that sent three teams of elders to prayer walk around our townhouse. I sent them packing after I opened the door and asked them what they were doing. \u201cCan we speak to your mom?\u201d asked one of the older gentlemen in a suit and a tie.</p> <p>\u201cI am the mom,\u201d I said and slammed the door shut. They left a flyer under the door and walked around our townhouse praying once more, for good measure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;is-extract=true&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F6c671690ce3cc42854cbef0586f079a332e53dab%3Fcrop%3D0_0_323_499&amp;title=God%20Land&amp;author=Lyz%20Lenz&amp;publisher=Indiana%20University%20Press&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F41707938-god-land\" data-alt=\"god land\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&is-extract=true&image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F6c671690ce3cc42854cbef0586f079a332e53dab%3Fcrop%3D0_0_323_499&title=God%20Land&author=Lyz%20Lenz&publisher=Indiana%20University%20Press&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F41707938-god-land\">god land</a> </figure>  <p>After three years of searching, Dave and I finally ended up at an Evangelical Free church. There we met other couples and got involved with the youth group. But even then, that church wasn\u2019t an easy fit for us. Or, I should be clear, it wasn\u2019t an easy fit for me.</p> <p>The church was a lot like the Evangelical churches Dave and I had attended as kids \u2013 raucous music, a pastor who gave sermons that often included video clips and pop culture references. There was no liturgy, there were no organs and most of the people who attended seemed to be our age. Few people drank, no one smoked and they all loved to discuss the Book of Revelation after one too many Mountain Dews at a church party.</p> <p>While I loved the people there, I didn\u2019t like the church\u2019s theology. The church was and is very conservative; their theology was that of the Evangelical Free Church of America, which doesn\u2019t affirm women or gay people as pastors or elders. Strict gender roles were enforced and even seen as freeing. Everybody was white.</p> <p>As someone who doesn\u2019t like to wear bras on principle, I frequently found myself chafing against the strict orthodox interpretation of the Bible and the long lectures I was often given by male members of the church about how if I believed women could be pastors I was questioning the inerrancy of the Bible.</p> <p>But in those early days of my marriage and my adult life, I thought that these problems were minor squabbles. Something to be hashed out over late nights playing board games and drinking wine, or wine for me, Fresca for the rest of them. It was a breezy naivety, born of my childhood raised in an Evangelical homeschool subculture in Texas. Until I went to high school at a public school, everyone I knew believed in a literal six-day creation by the hand and voice of God. Everyone believed that being gay was a sin.</p> <p>I was used to being the outsider \u2013 the lone voice of dissent. I was comfortable with this role because I wasn\u2019t threatened by it. Not yet, anyway. I wasn\u2019t gay. I wasn\u2019t a person of color. I was a woman, but the gentle grasp of patriarchy hadn\u2019t yet threatened to strangle me, because I hadn\u2019t yet tried to get free. Or perhaps I had, but I was so used to a religion that told me I was wrong and objectionable, it never occurred to me there could be another way.</p> <p>Faith was also so much more to me than a God I occasionally sang songs to in church or prayed to over meals. Faith had provided the entire fabric of my existence. It was the cytoplasm in which I existed \u2013 the amniotic fluid that sustained my relationships with my husband and my family. It\u2019s the air I was raised with. My mother read the Bible to us in the mornings, and my father read it to us before I went to sleep at night. I could not conceive of myself outside of religion.</p> <p>Because I could not imagine life outside the womb of my faith, I struggled inside its limitations. I thought there would always be room for me. But the reality was, there was only room for me if I made myself smaller and smaller and smaller, until I disappeared. Or else I\u2019d be pushed out into a bright new horrible, beautiful world, where I would gasp and scream and try to breathe, for once, on my own.</p> <p>But in those early days, I kicked around, trying to make my place, approaching my disagreements head on. During a membership class at our Evangelical church, the one we\u2019d later leave, I eagerly debated the head pastor, Travis, over whether the Bible supported female ordination. My husband, who agreed with the church\u2019s stances, sat stony-faced as I recited the arguments I\u2019d learned from my Lutheran friends and from reading books such as Ten Lies the Church Tells Women. The pastor gamely debated me, but stood strong. \u201cI agree the topic needs more investigation\u201d was all he would allow.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>I didn\u2019t need to be right, I just needed to be treated like someone smart, someone with something to offer besides filling a nursery volunteer spot on Sunday mornings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And I took it, that proffered breadcrumb, as a promise to journey together \u2013 to listen to one another. I took it as a sign of respect. And that\u2019s all I needed. I didn\u2019t need to be right, I just needed to be treated like someone smart, someone with something to offer besides filling a nursery volunteer spot on Sunday mornings. I needed to be treated like a person.</p> <p>The promised investigation never came. That offer was just a way of putting me off, shutting me up. A year later, when I asked if we could have a Bible study that opened up the topic, I wasn\u2019t shut down, I was just ignored. I asked the question of the pastor and he smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Nothing else. And every time I brought it up, that\u2019s what I was told. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p> <p>Death by a thousand maybes.</p> <p>It\u2019s a passive-aggressive technique \u2013 a denial by silence. There is nothing to fight against. Just resolute lips and an unfocused gaze, that refuses to see you, your desperation, humanity and longing. I\u2019m used to that look. I get it a lot. Or at least, I used to.</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent my whole life in conservative Evangelical churches. Born the second of eight kids and raised in Texas, I spent my spiritual childhood hearing hour-long sermons in humid, brown churches filled with the Holy Spirit and brisket and pastors who sweat through their shirtsleeves proclaiming the second coming of the Lord.</p> <p>In Sunday school, we looked for signs and revelations of the impending apocalypse: the tentative peace recently brokered in the Middle East, the talk of rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem, the war on religion we were told that Janet Reno was perpetuating with the attacks on Ruby Ridge and Waco. I went to sleep afraid I\u2019d wake up to find my whole family raptured. When I went to the toilet, I prayed to Jesus not to call me up to heaven right then and there with my pants pulled down.</p> <p>At home my father taught us that numerology showed Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s name worked out to 666. My mother made us read The Hiding Place, and we talked about what we\u2019d do in the end times when we were persecuted for our faith.</p> <p>I read Frank Peretti\u2019s books, hiding under the covers, dreaming about the thin veil between the spiritual world and the one where I bit my nails and prayed for Jesus to make me good. I was no good in the churches of my childhood \u2013 I was too loud, too demanding, I looked too much like a boy, I asked too many questions.</p> <p>By the time I was 18 years old, I\u2019d been in small churches where pastors slept with congregants and in megachurches where youth pastors slept with teens. I\u2019d seen gay women kicked out of the congregations they loved because they wouldn\u2019t apologize for who God created them to be. I\u2019d seen my friend, pregnant at 16, asked to stop singing with the worship team, while the boy who was the father still led prayers on Wednesday nights. By the time I finally went to college, I had given up. For four years, I never went to chapel. I still believed in God, but I didn\u2019t believe in church.</p> <p>After I graduated and married Dave, who\u2019d been raised in the soft evangelicalism of the upper-middle-class white midwestern suburbs, I was determined that we would find a new church together; one that fit both of us.</p> <p>We moved to Cedar Rapids for his job, and the first thing he did was make a list of all the churches he wanted to visit. Without my input. In hindsight, this wasn\u2019t a good sign. But it\u2019s also how he put together our budget, planned vacations and bought cars. I had a choice \u2013 and that choice was to choose from the options on his spreadsheet. And when you are young and in love and used to the patriarchy as a modus operandi, well, you put up with a lot of things without thinking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>We weren\u2019t looking for perfection, we just wanted a home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dave and I worked through the list in alphabetical order until we finally settled into the Evangelical Free church. We weren\u2019t looking for perfection, we just wanted a home. Or, more accurately, I wanted a home. I wanted a place that would accept all of me. Where I wouldn\u2019t be forced to hide my questions and my doubts, swallow my fears and outrage and get along. Perhaps that\u2019s why, when Pastor Travis told me we\u2019d talk about it later or that he was thinking about my idea of the Bible study examining the woman\u2019s role in the church, I took him at his word.</p> <p>Compliance is easier than questioning. The appearance of unity is easier than the messy actualities. And I think part of me always understood that if I pushed too hard, I would be cast out of everything I knew. That I\u2019d lose everything. So I smiled during sermons I hated. I kept silent during Bible studies where people spoke of dinosaurs and humans roaming the earth together before Noah\u2019s flood.</p> <p>Dave and I put everything into that church. We volunteered with the youth on Wednesday nights, I helped with the coffee every Sunday and in the nursery, and we went on a trip to Israel and on a mission trip to El Salvador.</p> <p>On that mission trip, everything fell apart. It fell apart because I asked to lead the prayer during devotionals one morning. Steven, the pastor leading the group, had frowned and told me that wasn\u2019t my place. I was furious. I had a specific story I wanted to share. One of our local hosts, a woman and a pastor, had taken me with her on her visits to the sick people in the village. I\u2019d used my Spanish-English dictionary to talk to a man about how my sisters had been hit by a car, just like he had. How one of my sisters also had a hard time walking. It was a small moment of connection that I wanted to tell everyone about, and I wanted to pray for him.</p> <p>But Steven was upset because I had been with a female pastor, and he didn\u2019t think it was my place to be leading even devotions in our majority male group. Steven\u2019s approach even angered Dave. When I had told Steven that nothing in the Bible prevented me from talking out loud in a small group, he replied by saying: \u201cIt\u2019s there in the scripture, right here where you are told to submit.\u201d</p> <p>When Dave and I returned from the trip, we met with Pastor Travis and voiced our concerns. We had heard that other people had similar concerns with this same pastor, and I said that.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d Travis said.</p> <p>\u201cYou know who,\u201d I said. \u201cThey told me they told you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one told me anything,\u201d he said.</p> <p>My husband spoke up. \u201cWe know people have talked to you about how this man treats people.\u201d</p> <p>Pastor Travis bowed his head and folded his hands for a moment. When he looked up, he met my husband\u2019s eyes and said: \u201cYou are right. I don\u2019t know why I lied and I apologize to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApologize to me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou lied to me, not to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did apologize to you when I apologized to your husband,\u201d Pastor Travis replied, looking not at me but at Dave. We had been going to that church for five years together and here I was, not even worthy of an apology.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>We had been going to that church for five years together and here I was, not even worthy of an apology</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I had trusted Pastor Travis. I had believed that, even though we disagreed, he saw me as a human \u2013 smart, worthy of time and consideration. But in that moment, with his resolute lips and gaze focused somewhere over my head, I saw that I wasn\u2019t a whole person to him. I wasn\u2019t even worthy of my own apology. Whatever story I had told myself about mutual respect turned out to be just a lie. That offer to \u201cjourney together\u201d was just a coded way of saying: \u201cYou\u2019ll eventually grow up and agree with me.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the last time I heard that phrase.</p> <p>Pastor Travis and Steven did try to reach out with apologies for the misunderstandings, but I refused to speak to them. There was no misunderstanding. I thought I was a smart person, fully capable of studying the Bible and engaging with spirituality on my own, and they disagreed. When someone denies the very core of who you are, it\u2019s hard to dialogue.</p> <p>There are so many churches that remain strong while being awful to women or providing safe havens for the power hungry. And there are so many good places that close despite being a home for the hungry, the lost and the hurting. To brush off problems with churches as the problems of the inherently flawed nature of people is to miss the bigger picture: that life and faith can function together in a place where all are welcome and respected.</p>",

Dave and I worked through the list in alphabetical order until we finally settled into the Evangelical Free church. We weren\u2019t looking for perfection, we just wanted a home. Or, more accurately, I wanted a home. I wanted a place that would accept all of me. Where I wouldn\u2019t be forced to hide my questions and my doubts, swallow my fears and outrage and get along. Perhaps that\u2019s why, when Pastor Travis told me we\u2019d talk about it later or that he was thinking about my idea of the Bible study examining the woman\u2019s role in the church, I took him at his word. Compliance is easier than questioning. The appearance of unity is easier than the messy actualities. And I think part of me always understood that if I pushed too hard, I would be cast out of everything I knew. That I\u2019d lose everything. So I smiled during sermons I hated. I kept silent during Bible studies where people spoke of dinosaurs and humans roaming the earth together before Noah\u2019s flood. Dave and I put everything into that church. We volunteered with the youth on Wednesday nights, I helped with the coffee every Sunday and in the nursery, and we went on a trip to Israel and on a mission trip to El Salvador. On that mission trip, everything fell apart. It fell apart because I asked to lead the prayer during devotionals one morning. Steven, the pastor leading the group, had frowned and told me that wasn\u2019t my place. I was furious. I had a specific story I wanted to share. One of our local hosts, a woman and a pastor, had taken me with her on her visits to the sick people in the village. I\u2019d used my Spanish-English dictionary to talk to a man about how my sisters had been hit by a car, just like he had. How one of my sisters also had a hard time walking. It was a small moment of connection that I wanted to tell everyone about, and I wanted to pray for him. But Steven was upset because I had been with a female pastor, and he didn\u2019t think it was my place to be leading even devotions in our majority male group. Steven\u2019s approach even angered Dave. When I had told Steven that nothing in the Bible prevented me from talking out loud in a small group, he replied by saying: \u201cIt\u2019s there in the scripture, right here where you are told to submit.\u201d When Dave and I returned from the trip, we met with Pastor Travis and voiced our concerns. We had heard that other people had similar concerns with this same pastor, and I said that. \u201cWhat? Who?\u201d Travis said. \u201cYou know who,\u201d I said. \u201cThey told me they told you.\u201d \u201cNo one told me anything,\u201d he said. My husband spoke up. \u201cWe know people have talked to you about how this man treats people.\u201d Pastor Travis bowed his head and folded his hands for a moment. When he looked up, he met my husband\u2019s eyes and said: \u201cYou are right. I don\u2019t know why I lied and I apologize to you.\u201d \u201cApologize to me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou lied to me, not to him.\u201d \u201cI did apologize to you when I apologized to your husband,\u201d Pastor Travis replied, looking not at me but at Dave. We had been going to that church for five years together and here I was, not even worthy of an apology. I had trusted Pastor Travis. I had believed that, even though we disagreed, he saw me as a human \u2013 smart, worthy of time and consideration. But in that moment, with his resolute lips and gaze focused somewhere over my head, I saw that I wasn\u2019t a whole person to him. I wasn\u2019t even worthy of my own apology. Whatever story I had told myself about mutual respect turned out to be just a lie. That offer to \u201cjourney together\u201d was just a coded way of saying: \u201cYou\u2019ll eventually grow up and agree with me.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the last time I heard that phrase. Pastor Travis and Steven did try to reach out with apologies for the misunderstandings, but I refused to speak to them. There was no misunderstanding. I thought I was a smart person, fully capable of studying the Bible and engaging with spirituality on my own, and they disagreed. When someone denies the very core of who you are, it\u2019s hard to dialogue. There are so many churches that remain strong while being awful to women or providing safe havens for the power hungry. And there are so many good places that close despite being a home for the hungry, the lost and the hurting. To brush off problems with churches as the problems of the inherently flawed nature of people is to miss the bigger picture: that life and faith can function together in a place where all are welcome and respected.",

      "bodyText": "Eric Pineda runs a modest beachfront restaurant which serves up plates of fresh fish and rice \u2013 and faces imminent destruction. A recent tidal surge razed the nightclub next door, leaving a pastel pink ruin, and in the past two years, several other businesses between Pineda\u2019s property and the Pacific Ocean have been destroyed by sudden waves. \u201cEvery year, the ocean is getting closer and higher. I think we\u2019ve got a year \u2013 maybe two \u2013 before the water takes us too,\u201d said Pineda, 24. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long.\u201d Golden beaches once helped transform this fishing community on the Gulf of Fonseca into a thriving tourist destination. Nowadays, however, there are barely a few metres of sand left, and rising water levels and tidal surges have wiped out roads, homes and businesses. Locals estimate that around a metre of ground is lost every year \u2013 which means this entire community will soon be under water. The same predicament is faced by settlements along the Pacific coast of Honduras, where land and its people are disappearing fast. In recent years, millions of people have fled Central America to escape grinding poverty, institutional collapse and untrammeled violence. But another factor behind the exodus has received less attention: conflicts over natural resources which have been intensified by corporate expansion and climate change. Sea levels are rising around the world, but in this region another local factor is helping speed up coastal degradation: swathes of mangrove forests have been destroyed to make way for industrial shrimp farms which have proliferated even inside protected reserves. Many Honduran shrimps are exported to the US and the UK, where they are sold in major supermarket chains including Waitrose, Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks &amp; Spencer. \u201cThe industry destroys huge mangrove sites promising development, but actually creates very few jobs \u2013 and actually increases poverty by restricting fishing access for locals,\u201d said Dina Morel, director of a local marine conservation organization, known by its acronym Coddeffagolf. According to Morel, shrimp farms are routinely approved in protected areas and environmental violations rarely punished as officials often have vested interests in the profitable industry. \u201cThe consequences of losing this essential ecosystem are clear,\u201d said biologist V\u00edctor Bocanegra. \u201cEnvironmental vulnerability, food insecurity, poverty and social decomposition, which all leads to forced migration.\u201d Mangroves are essential to healthy, resilient coastlines. The sturdy trees protect shorelines from storms and floods, and help prevent erosion by stabilizing sediments with their intertwined roots. They are key factors in marine biodiversity, providing food, clean water, shelter and safety for fish and invertebrates such as crabs, lobsters and prawns. In order to take advantage of this natural symbiosis, acres and acres of shrimp farms have been built inland in ocean inlets which were once safe havens for tidal waves. But the farms block the natural flow of water, causing high tides and storm surges to immerse beach communities instead. On Cede\u00f1o beach, Ariana Tees, 70, is frying fish caught by her husband, Manuel, 67, in a makeshift tarpaulin kitchen just metres from the sea. This is where they live, work, eat and sleep, but every month they are forced further and further back as the ocean inches closer inland. \u201cOf course we\u2019re scared,\u201d said Tees. \u201cBut we\u2019ve nowhere else to go, and there\u2019s no protection from the government, not even a barrier.\u201d Manuel, who has been fishing since he was a child, said: \u201cEvery year there is less fish, and the surges have nowhere to go \u2013 so the water comes here looking for an exit. We\u2019ve woken up in the middle of the night surrounded by water.\u201d He paused, before concluding: \u201cBasically we\u2019re fucked.\u201d The shrimp industry in southern Honduras dates back to the 1970s, but grew exponentially in the 1990s. As a result, in 2000, seven mangrove forests covering over 150,000 acres were designated protected reserves. Despite this, half the region\u2019s mangroves were destroyed between 2000 and 2010 \u2013 largely as a result of fishing concessions sanctioned before the decree, according to research by Coddeffagolf. No one knows exactly how much of the protected areas remain intact, but satellite images seen by the Guardian suggest the situation is critical. The extent of the deforestation can be seen from a mountain peak in San Jos\u00e9 de Las Conchas, 20 miles north of Cede\u00f1o, where the panorama reveals only slivers of protected mangroves nestled between massive manmade shrimp lagoons and the turquoise ocean. Locals say shrimp companies build farms in secret \u2013 hidden from view by a ring of mangroves \u2013 then obtain permits retrospectively. Sales figures suggest shrimp farms are expanding: $216m of shrimps were exported last year, a figure expected to rise by up to 20% in 2019. FundeSur, a social responsibility foundation created by the shrimp industry in 2014, claims to invest $0.02 for every pound of shrimp exported into health, education and environmental projects. But reforestation programmes, which require years of nurturing to ensure hardy shrubs, are rare. FundeSur did not respond to repeated requests for comment. \u201cThere is more deforestation than reforestation, that\u2019s evident for everyone to see,\u201d said Nelson Mart\u00ednez, a grassroots organiser from Guapinol, a nearby community badly damaged by a tidal surge three years ago. \u201cUnless the mangroves are saved, Guapinol will disappear too.\u201d A thin strip of land sandwiched between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, Central America is especially vulnerable to the global climate emergency. Between 1998 and 2017, Honduras was the second country or territory most affected by extreme weather events such as floods, storms, droughts and wildfires, according to the Global Risk Index. (Puerto Rico came first.) Hurricane Mitch \u2013 the most deadly storm in the western hemisphere in over two centuries \u2013 left at least 8,000 people dead and a million others homeless and landless when it struck in 1998. It set the country\u2019s economic development back at least 50 years and triggered the first wave of post-cold war Central American migration to the US. Yet, investment in climate mitigation and adaption programmes such as reforestation and flood defences is falling. Only 0.5% of the central government budget is allocated to environmental protection this year, down from 1.2% in 2010, according to analysis by economist Hugo Pino, a former finance minister and central bank governor. Since a 2009 coup, a profusion of water-guzzling megaprojects \u2013 including dams, mines, and African palm plantations \u2013 has fuelled social conflicts, state repression and migration. Berta C\u00e1ceres, a Goldman environmental prize winner, was murdered in March 2016 in retaliation for leading opposition to the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the river Gualcarque, relied upon by the indigenous Lenca people for food, water and medicines. \u201cThe key issue connecting climate change and governments is water governance \u2013 the politics deciding who gets priority to enough good quality water,\u201d said Professor Ra\u00fal Pacheco-Vega, an environmental politics scholar at the centre for economic research and teaching (Cide) in Mexico. In Honduras, the upshot of water politics is stark: every year during the rainy season, countless communities are cut off, lives are lost, and roads, bridges and schools are damaged. It is a cycle of environmental destruction that exacerbates poverty and drives migration as families search for food, water and safety.

Half a million Hondurans heading north have been apprehended by US and Mexican officials since October 2016. The motives for migration are always complex, but in this region, environmental factors are increasingly important. Pedro Landa from Eric, a Jesuits human rights research organisation, said the lessons from Mitch were never learned. \u201cSince the [2009] coup, the state has been increasingly controlled by mafia politicians with no interest in guaranteeing water supplies or economic development for ordinary people, just for themselves.\u201d",

Ice later revealed that as many as 28 women had miscarried in their custody in the last two years.</p> <p>Migrant advocates and pregnant asylum seekers waiting to cross the border in Tijuana have heard about the increase in miscarriages while in Ice custody.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been anecdotes of women having miscarriages in detention and Ice officers denying they were ever pregnant, so we\u2019re offering pregnancy tests for those who want a record of their pregnancy,\u201d said Phil Canete, lead coordinator for the Refugee Health Alliance, a clinic based in Tijuana.</p> <p>Esther\u2019s description of her time in detention offers a stark picture for a pregnant woman, especially one whose first child had been born premature. Mishori said Esther being a minor also increases the risk for her second pregnancy.</p> <p>Esther said that during the week she and the other detained minors at her facility were only given two meals a day.</p> <p>On a typical weekday she was woken at 5am and given a prenatal vitamin that made her nauseous. At 6am she had breakfast, and at 7am she and her daughter were separated for the day and she went to class until 4pm. She said some teachers brought them a snack of apples or pears, but on most days she said she didn\u2019t eat again until dinner at 5pm.</p> <p>\u201c[Esther] didn\u2019t receive adequate nutrition and that\u2019s very concerning and can affect her and obviously the fetus,\u201d said Mishori.</p> <p>Esther suffered from daily nausea and vomiting, which Mishori said is common for the first trimester, but that it\u2019s vital pregnant women continue gaining weight.</p> <p>In addition to being hungry, Esther recalled constant fatigue, as she was often not allowed to return to her room to rest between her 5am wakeup and her 10pm bedtime.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you think about a woman in that first trimester it\u2019s a period of very great physiological changes that often cause women to be more tired,\u201d Mishori said.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Patrick Fisher, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s Administration for Children and Families, said that every child in custody receives \u201cthree meals a day plus snacks\u201d in addition to other services such as medical and mental healthcare, education and recreation.</p> <p>Esther said that during her time in detention she was taken to three medical visits, and at the second visit she was given an ultrasound and told her baby was a girl. She said the doctors did not mention her weight loss as a problem but did tell her she needed to be drinking a lot of water, which was readily available in the facility.</p> <p>Despite having several family members in the US prepared to be her sponsor, it took two months for Esther to be released.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When he calls, I hold the phone to Milagro\u2019s ear so she can hear him, but she doesn\u2019t say anything, she just cries</p> <footer> <cite>Esther Ramos</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Esther and Aldana decided to flee Honduras because a group of narco-traffickers started killing Aldana\u2019s family members one by one after his brother refused to hand over his small plot of land.

Esther and her daughter spent three days in a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) holding cell, where she said she wasn\u2019t offered any food on her first day and she hardly ate during the next two days. \u201cThey gave us burritos in the morning and at night and a small sandwich during the day, but I only drank the juice because I was scared I would get sick \u2013 all of the food looked like it was prepared a really long time ago,\u201d Esther said. Because she and her daughter are both under 18, they were then sent to a facility for unaccompanied minors in San Benito, Texas, where they were held for over two months. During her time in detention, as her pregnancy progressed, Esther lost 20 pounds. Critics say experiences like Esther\u2019s are becoming more common as pregnant migrants \u2013 whether minors like Esther or adults \u2013 are being detained in increasing numbers and for longer periods of time as the Trump administration cracks down on border crossings. Under the Obama administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) had a policy of presumption of release for all pregnant women, except under \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d. \u201cPregnant women shouldn\u2019t be in detention, period,\u201d said Dr Ranit Mishori, an expert medical consultant for Physicians for Human Rights and professor of Family Medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to overrule the previous policy in March 2018. In February, a 24 year-old Honduran detainee went into premature labor at the Point Isabel detention center in Texas and gave birth to a stillborn baby. Ice later revealed that as many as 28 women had miscarried in their custody in the last two years. Migrant advocates and pregnant asylum seekers waiting to cross the border in Tijuana have heard about the increase in miscarriages while in Ice custody. \u201cThere have been anecdotes of women having miscarriages in detention and Ice officers denying they were ever pregnant, so we\u2019re offering pregnancy tests for those who want a record of their pregnancy,\u201d said Phil Canete, lead coordinator for the Refugee Health Alliance, a clinic based in Tijuana. Esther\u2019s description of her time in detention offers a stark picture for a pregnant woman, especially one whose first child had been born premature. Mishori said Esther being a minor also increases the risk for her second pregnancy. Esther said that during the week she and the other detained minors at her facility were only given two meals a day. On a typical weekday she was woken at 5am and given a prenatal vitamin that made her nauseous. At 6am she had breakfast, and at 7am she and her daughter were separated for the day and she went to class until 4pm. She said some teachers brought them a snack of apples or pears, but on most days she said she didn\u2019t eat again until dinner at 5pm. \u201c[Esther] didn\u2019t receive adequate nutrition and that\u2019s very concerning and can affect her and obviously the fetus,\u201d said Mishori. Esther suffered from daily nausea and vomiting, which Mishori said is common for the first trimester, but that it\u2019s vital pregnant women continue gaining weight. In addition to being hungry, Esther recalled constant fatigue, as she was often not allowed to return to her room to rest between her 5am wakeup and her 10pm bedtime. \u201cWhen you think about a woman in that first trimester it\u2019s a period of very great physiological changes that often cause women to be more tired,\u201d Mishori said. In a statement to the Guardian, Patrick Fisher, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s Administration for Children and Families, said that every child in custody receives \u201cthree meals a day plus snacks\u201d in addition to other services such as medical and mental healthcare, education and recreation. Esther said that during her time in detention she was taken to three medical visits, and at the second visit she was given an ultrasound and told her baby was a girl. She said the doctors did not mention her weight loss as a problem but did tell her she needed to be drinking a lot of water, which was readily available in the facility. Despite having several family members in the US prepared to be her sponsor, it took two months for Esther to be released. Esther and Aldana decided to flee Honduras because a group of narco-traffickers started killing Aldana\u2019s family members one by one after his brother refused to hand over his small plot of land. They traveled by foot and bus with the migrant caravan to reach the US-Mexico border, where they waited two months for their chance to turn themselves in. Aldana was transferred to a detention center in Louisiana where he has been for more than seven months now. Esther said her daughter and husband have always been close but they became especially attached in their last month together because he was always the one holding her; he didn\u2019t want any heavy lifting to hurt Esther\u2019s pregnancy. \u201cWhen he calls, I hold the phone to Milagro\u2019s ear so she can hear him, but she doesn\u2019t say anything, she just cries,\u201d Esther said. They both hope he\u2019s released from detention before her baby is due next month, but they have no idea if that will happen. About Esther and her time in detention, Mishori said she ticks a lot of boxes of some of the most vulnerable people: being a woman, pregnant, having a child and being a child herself. \u201cSo, that\u2019s sort of the big picture here, that she shouldn\u2019t have been in detention at all,\u201d Mishori said.

      "bodyText": "John Sidoti took a touch. Then another. In his personalised Matildas kit, the New South Wales minister for sport was feeling the momentum. The ball was racing away but, if he stretched, he could probably make it. He couldn\u2019t. On Tuesday afternoon, at an event to support Australia\u2019s 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup bid, Sidoti dribbled through a field of talented junior Matildas, and fell over head first. Sidoti was in good spirits as he joined the hallowed halls of politicians failing completely at sport. \u201cI was weaving through them, but I was getting carried away,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about up and coming Matildas. I was living my childhood dream.\u201d The Juventus-supporting Sydney MP denied any accusations of diving. \u201cThe pitch wasn\u2019t fantastic. I\u2019ve got pointy shoes \u2026 I\u2019ve got my wedding shoes on practically. \u201cI think it highlights that my days in soccer are over. End of the day, everything we do is about the grassroots, and supporting women\u2019s sport.\u201d But can anything top the irony of a sports minister tripping himself up? John Howard The iconic Australian political sporting fail happened on a dirt pitch in Pakistan. On a visit to the earthquake-damaged area of Dhanni in 2005, John Howard set up stumps. The three wobbly deliveries echoed down the generations, even as they failed to make it to the crease. Malcolm Turnbull In 2017, Malcolm Turnbull took some time off from the Liberal party conference in Perth to shoot some hoops. It did not go well. Kevin Rudd Kevin Rudd has always been popular with the kids. A lot of that is due to his constant willingness to enter the fiery lunchtime arena of handball. Rudd\u2019s technique is unconventional but still beautiful, a kind of whole-body followthrough, where his entire being ripples with the effort. From Kelvin Grove State College: To Brisbane State High School: But chin-ups did not go so well: Boris Johnson Whereas Sidoti had the good grace to fail in front of the junior Matildas, other politicians have happily swept small children from their path to prove themselves good at sport. See the new UK prime minister, Boris Johnson: In 2006, Johnson also did this to the former German international Maurizio Gaudino in the 87th minute of a charity game. Bob Katter Sometimes a picture can be composed so perfectly, with such an understanding of form and framing and movement, that it flows before your eyes. Like the Mona Lisa\u2019s smile following you across the room, there is no escaping the image of Bob Katter, neck bulging, as he monsters three young kids at a family game of beach rugby. No footage seems to exist, but you don\u2019t need it. Tony Abbott The genuinely athletic Tony Abbott made headlines in 2016, when after being ousted as PM he stole the wave of a 17-year old surfer at Noosa. The triathlete politician appeared in the surf, \u201cjust sitting there on his board, waiting for a wave\u201d, according to Ivy Thomas. \u201cBecause I was on the inside of him and it\u2019s a right-hand break, I technically had right of way \u2026 That was supposed to be my wave \u2013 but I don\u2019t really mind,\u201d she said. Abbott also formerly captained his Sydney University rugby team, and made a return to the field in 2018, playing loose-head prop, but was injured after eight minutes. Donald Trump Did you know that Donald Trump took part in the WWE in 2007, where he tackled the chairman Vince McMahon before then slowly shaving him bald? I didn\u2019t either. Scott Morrison In April, in the middle of the election campaign, Scott Morrison embarked on a sports blitz, picking up, kicking and heading any ball or racquet shaped object that found itself near him. The pictures were not flattering: But oddly, some of the footage was. Barack Obama And finally, to dispel the dozens of failures and embarrassments above, enjoy Barack Obama being very good at basketball. The 44th president of the United States was an avid player, who won a state championship in college in Hawaii and organised regular games while in office.",

Tide + Seek bikinis and swimsuits (\u00a365) are made using only Repreve, a polyester created from 100%-recycled plastic (mainly bottles), as are trunks from Riz Board Shorts (\u00a398). Synthetic swimwear sheds microfibres of plastic when washed, which can end up in the ocean. To combat this, Cora Ball\u2019s laundry ball (\u00a329.95) and Guppyfriend\u2019s washing bag (\u00a324) are designed to catch the fibres; the latter also reduces fibre shedding and protects clothes. Sunscreen The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) recommends using marine-safe sunscreen for holidays, wherever you are, as certain chemicals can harm marine life, including creatures found in UK waters, it says. \u201cUnfortunately sunscreens have been shown to have an impact on the marine environment \u2013 not just coral reefs but also other marine organisms,\u201d the MCS said. \u201cOxybenzone and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (octinoxate) are particularly harmful, and MCS recommends avoiding sunscreens with these ingredients.\u201d Bans on sunscreen containing these chemicals are planned in Palau island in the Pacific (from 2020), Hawaii (2021), and Key West in Florida (2021), and although they are not outlawed in Mexico, many cenotes and other tourist destinations ask visitors not to use them. Sunscreen is categorised as chemical (absorbs UV rays) or mineral (creates a layer on top of the skin to deflect them). Chemical ones often require less-frequent application and, unlike some mineral ones, don\u2019t leave a white cast on the skin. Boots says its Soltan suncream (from \u00a33.50) contains neither oxybenzone nor octinoxate, because it sources \u201cingredients that protect environments across the globe\u201d. Amazinc has a mineral sunscreen (from \u00a311), made from a combination of zinc oxide, magnesium oxide and lanolin, that comes in plastic-free, zero-waste packaging. Key to its eco-friendly credentials is that it doesn\u2019t use nano mineral particles, which can harm the environment. It also avoids titanium dioxide because of the unsustainable high-temperature processes associated with its production as a UV filter. Shade Cream makes all-natural mineral sunscreen using four ingredients: zinc oxide, unrefined beeswax, shea butter and coconut oil (the last two being 100% Soil Association-certified organic). It also comes in a plastic-free tub and isn\u2019t tested on animals. Sunglasses W R Yuma 3D-prints its sunglasses from recycled plastic found on the banks of waterways around Antwerp. It and partner company Stormkop work with local children to collect and clean waste for creative projects, aiming to help change perspectives on the value of waste material. Some of the plastic is then shredded and melted into 3D printing filament (ink), and used to print glasses (from \u00a3115). Handcrafted from sustainable bamboo, Wear Panda sunglasses (from \u00a369) have low environmental impact compared with most plastic shades. Bamboo is durable, renewable and relatively easy to grow, without needing pesticides or fertilisers. The company also works with Optometry Giving Sight, and for every pair it sells, someone without access to eye care will receive a medical eye examination and a free pair of prescription glasses. Another one-for-one initiative comes from Wildwood, which plants a tree for every pair of sunglasses sold, to help combat deforestation. Each pair of handmade sunglasses, with carved wooden frames (from \u00a369), is named after an endangered species and comes in a natural bamboo case. Flip-flops Thongs, slops, jandals \u2026 whatever you call them, they are worn by millions of people around the world. Recycling plastic flip-flops is difficult \u2013 some companies use them to create new products, such as OceanSole in Kenya \u2013 but largely they end up in landfill. The longer-term option is to buy ones made from sustainable materials. Ethletic uses sustainable, Fairtrade materials for its Rubb flip-flops (\u00a318), which are vegan and created from 100% FSC-certified natural rubber from small farms in Sri Lanka. They are strong, lightweight and come in a range of colours. It also makes Fair-flops (\u00a322), using the same rubber, with an organic cotton canvas top layer. Brothers We Stand has created flip-flops by fusing rubber particles from old tyres, without adhesives or harmful chemicals. It says that the Ecoalf (\u00a335), which comes in black, is the \u201cfirst 100%-recycled flip-flop\u201d. Beach toys Green Toys sand playset (\u00a316.49) includes a brightly coloured bucket with a hard-wearing cotton rope, plus a spade, fork and castle mould. All are made from 100% recycled plastic and free from PVC, BPA and phthalates. Also from Green Toys is the EcoSaucer Flying Disc (\u00a34.99), and like all its products it comes in recycled-cardboard packaging. Created from Planwood, an eco-material made from waste-sustainable rubberwood sawdust from its factory, and coloured with organic pigments, the PlanToys sand playset (\u00a329.99, Babipur) includes a bucket and three fish-shaped spades. All its toys come in recycled, non-toxic packaging. \u201cChanging the world one bubble at a time,\u201d Dr Zigs has created a giant bubble kit (\u00a319.99) that includes wooden wands from sustainable sources, untreated cotton ropes and non-toxic bubble mix.

I know a lot of Tory MPs and I am sad to say the public is basically correct.\u201d Now back to the present day, wherein Cummings is a key adviser to Boris Johnson. The prime minister has clashed with the Irish taoiseach over Brexit \u2013 the former saying the EU must drop the backstop to avoid a no-deal Brexit, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/30/johnson-varadkar-clash-over-irish-backstop-phone-call-brexit\">latter declaring it must stay</a>. Johnson is visiting Northern Ireland today.</p> \n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/31/how-has-brexit-vote-affected-the-uk-economy-july-verdict\">monthly Brexit analysis</a> is out today and suggests consumers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/31/british-consumer-keeps-uk-plc-afloat-as-key-sectors-start-to-sink\">propping up Britain\u2019s economic performance but key sectors are showing signs of strain</a>: the pound has slumped to its lowest against the greenback in 28 months. Wage growth has accelerated at the fastest annual rate since 2008 while retail sales rose by 3.8% on the year. However, there has been a slump in company activity as Brexit uncertainty bites, with both building and manufacturing falling into contraction. Professor David Blanchflower, former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, notes that Johnson \u201conly has 100 days to deliver on his dreamland Brexit pledges. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/31/no-deal-brexit-talk-has-hit-home-hard-two-experts-debate-the-data\">economically disastrous no-deal Brexit seems increasingly likely</a>.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Homeowner dream fades \u2013 </strong>Seventy per cent of young people believe owning a home is out of their generation\u2019s reach despite 91% wishing they could afford one, according to Santander. The bank has carried out the largest ever survey of potential first-time buyers in Britain and estimates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/31/young-britons-believe-dream-of-owning-home-is-over-survey-says\">fewer than 25% of 18- to 34-year-olds will be in a position to buy a home by the year 2026.</a> In 2006 around half of those under 34 were able to get on the property ladder, the bank says. Santander is calling for more flexible lending affordability criteria to help young people who struggle to save for a deposit, as well as lower stamp duty to encourage owners to sell family homes they have outgrown.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Midweek catch-up</strong></p> \n<p>&gt; North Korea has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/30/north-korea-unidentified-projectiles-fired-south-korea\">launched another volley of missiles into the sea</a>, after last week\u2019s test of a new short-range model.</p> \n<p>&gt; The Canadian double murder fugitives Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/31/canada-manhunt-suspects-were-let-go-after-being-stopped-at-checkpoint\">stopped for an alcohol check</a> by officers at a first nations community, but let go when they didn\u2019t have any, police have said.

The bacterial infection is passed on through tick bites, and without prompt diagnosis and antibiotics it can permanently damage the joints and nervous system. Scientists have forecast that diagnoses could top 8,000 this year compared with previous estimates of between 2,000 and 3,000 a year. \u201cThe point is that it\u2019s a lot, and it\u2019s everywhere, and that\u2019s why people should be informed,\u201d said Dr Victoria Cairns, the lead author of the study. Infection rates are higher in Scotland \u2013 probably due to its wetter climate which ticks like, and popularity with hikers \u2013 as well as in the south-west and south of England.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Johnson to EU \u2013 drop backstop or no deal Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray ushering you into the briefing room. It has emerged that Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave svengali, gave a speech in 2017 indicting the Conservatives did not care about poorer people or the NHS. \u201cThat is what most people in the country have thought about the Tory party for decades. I know a lot of Tory MPs and I am sad to say the public is basically correct.\u201d Now back to the present day, wherein Cummings is a key adviser to Boris Johnson. The prime minister has clashed with the Irish taoiseach over Brexit \u2013 the former saying the EU must drop the backstop to avoid a no-deal Brexit, and the latter declaring it must stay. Johnson is visiting Northern Ireland today. Our monthly Brexit analysis is out today and suggests consumers are propping up Britain\u2019s economic performance but key sectors are showing signs of strain: the pound has slumped to its lowest against the greenback in 28 months. Wage growth has accelerated at the fastest annual rate since 2008 while retail sales rose by 3.8% on the year. However, there has been a slump in company activity as Brexit uncertainty bites, with both building and manufacturing falling into contraction. Professor David Blanchflower, former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, notes that Johnson \u201conly has 100 days to deliver on his dreamland Brexit pledges. An economically disastrous no-deal Brexit seems increasingly likely.\u201d * * * Homeowner dream fades \u2013 Seventy per cent of young people believe owning a home is out of their generation\u2019s reach despite 91% wishing they could afford one, according to Santander. The bank has carried out the largest ever survey of potential first-time buyers in Britain and estimates fewer than 25% of 18- to 34-year-olds will be in a position to buy a home by the year 2026. In 2006 around half of those under 34 were able to get on the property ladder, the bank says. Santander is calling for more flexible lending affordability criteria to help young people who struggle to save for a deposit, as well as lower stamp duty to encourage owners to sell family homes they have outgrown. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; North Korea has launched another volley of missiles into the sea, after last week\u2019s test of a new short-range model. &gt; The Canadian double murder fugitives Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky were stopped for an alcohol check by officers at a first nations community, but let go when they didn\u2019t have any, police have said. The pair had not yet been named as suspects when they passed through the Manitoba community, where alcohol is banned. &gt; Protesters have clashed with police again in Hong Kong as 20 of their number were hauled before a court charged with rioting. Video shows one police officer pointing a shotgun at demonstrators. &gt; The UK is becoming hotter and wetter with fewer snow days, the Met\u2019s annual report on the subject says. A study of data stretching back to 1884 has found the 10 warmest years have all occurred since 2002, with 2014 taking the top spot. On average between 2009 and 2018 the UK was 0.9C warmer than the average for 1961\u20131990. &gt; Ten of the 20 Democratic candidates have taken part in another debate, this time in Detroit. Among them, the prominent contenders Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and rising stars Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke. &gt; The UK\u2019s cherry industry, which nearly collapsed 20 years ago under competition from overseas product, has bounced back with predictions of a bumper harvest this year. Some supermarkets say they no longer need to import during the British season. * * * Leave to keep paying \u2013 Young, lawful migrants who have grown up in the UK are being forced into destitution by recurring Home Office fees that have shot up from \u00a3601 to \u00a32,033. Meanwhile the length of time a resident must wait before applying for British citizenship has gone up from six years to 10 \u2013 pushing people into an increasingly precarious existence. Fees for \u201climited leave to remain\u201d are applied per person and status must be renewed every 30 months \u2013 leaving families paying thousands of pounds every two and a half years to stay on track. Ijeoma Moore, now 24, only speaks English and completed all her formal education in the UK, yet was nearly deported at the age of 15. The fees to continue her limited leave to remain, as well the \u00a31,000 NHS surcharges on migrants, and uncertainty over her university fees, have been crippling: \u201cThey keep moving the goalposts. It means I can never relax \u2013 I need to save just in case.\u201d * * * \u2018More police not enough\u2019 \u2013 Austerity-driven cuts that have left disadvantaged children vulnerable to gangs must be reversed to repair Britain\u2019s \u201csocial fabric\u201d and reduce crime, a police chief has said. Jon Boutcher, the chief constable of Bedfordshire, said no number of extra police officers would make the streets safer and significant numbers of offenders must be diverted from crime with a bigger investment in social services, education and mental health. The home affairs select committee of MPs has declared youth violence a social emergency. Its chair, Yvette Cooper, said the government had presided over a \u201cperfect storm of youth service cuts, police cuts, more children being excluded from school and a failure of statutory agencies to keep them safe\u201d. * * * \u2018It\u2019s everywhere\u2019 \u2013 Lyme disease in the UK may be three times more prevalent than previous estimates, according to new research. The bacterial infection is passed on through tick bites, and without prompt diagnosis and antibiotics it can permanently damage the joints and nervous system. Scientists have forecast that diagnoses could top 8,000 this year compared with previous estimates of between 2,000 and 3,000 a year. \u201cThe point is that it\u2019s a lot, and it\u2019s everywhere, and that\u2019s why people should be informed,\u201d said Dr Victoria Cairns, the lead author of the study. Infection rates are higher in Scotland \u2013 probably due to its wetter climate which ticks like, and popularity with hikers \u2013 as well as in the south-west and south of England. Our story has tips on how to avoid being bitten, and what to do if you are. Today in Focus podcast: Ungoverned obscenity Oliver Laughland discusses the mass protests in Puerto Rico that led to Ricardo Rossell\u00f3\u2019s resignation as governor. And: Larry Elliott on why sterling is at a 28-month low. Lunchtime read: \u2018Beautiful and terrifying\u2019 \u2013 the US by night For nearly 50 years, the photographer Camilo Jos\u00e9 Vergara has been documenting poor, segregated neighbourhoods in large US cities.

After winning back-to-back World Cups, the coach of the US women\u2019s football team, Jill Ellis, is stepping away on a high note. And a Transylvanian cricketer whose bowling technique was initially mocked online has been hailed as a hero after saying his love of the game trumped any criticism. Pavel Florin, a professional bodyguard by day and player-president of Romania\u2019s Cluj Cricket Club in his spare time, became an overnight sensation after a video of his wobbly deliveries against French club Dreux in the European Cricket League on Tuesday went viral. Business The pound faces another tumultuous day on the foreign exchanges today after falling to its lowest level for 28 months on Tuesday amid alarm that Boris Johnson could take the UK out of the European Union without a deal. Sterling had some respite overnight, climbing a fraction to $1.216. Consumers face rising prices for imported goods and holidaymakers will see their summer breaks abroad become much more costly. The pound is buying \u20ac1.09. Brexit concerns also hit shares in Asia overnight but all eyes will be on the US Federal Reserve later with rates expected to be cut by at least 0.25%.

      "body": "<p>One of Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lenders has found that 70% of young people now believe that the homeownership dream is over for their generation.</p> <p>Having carried out the largest-ever survey of potential first-time buyers, Santander said its own figures suggest less than 25% of 18- to 34-year-olds will be in a position to buy a home by the year 2026.</p> <p>The Spanish-owned bank said that while 91% of the young people interviewed still aspire to own a home, over two-thirds said it was unlikely to happen unless they received the deposit from their parents. Back in 2006, around half of those under 34 were able to get on the property ladder, the bank said.</p> <p>The study found that the sharpest fall in first-time buyer homeownership has been among those on middle-incomes \u2013 those earning between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 this year. Of the new buyers who had been able to buy, two-thirds reported having household incomes of more than \u00a340,000. </p> <p>Miguel Sard, managing director of Santander Mortgages, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that while the aspiration to own a home is just as strong as in previous generations, it\u2019s a dream that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/17/one-in-three-uk-millennials-will-never-own-a-home-report\">looking increasingly out of reach</a>.

      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lenders has found that 70% of young people now believe that the homeownership dream is over for their generation. Having carried out the largest-ever survey of potential first-time buyers, Santander said its own figures suggest less than 25% of 18- to 34-year-olds will be in a position to buy a home by the year 2026. The Spanish-owned bank said that while 91% of the young people interviewed still aspire to own a home, over two-thirds said it was unlikely to happen unless they received the deposit from their parents. Back in 2006, around half of those under 34 were able to get on the property ladder, the bank said. The study found that the sharpest fall in first-time buyer homeownership has been among those on middle-incomes \u2013 those earning between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 this year. Of the new buyers who had been able to buy, two-thirds reported having household incomes of more than \u00a340,000. Miguel Sard, managing director of Santander Mortgages, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that while the aspiration to own a home is just as strong as in previous generations, it\u2019s a dream that is looking increasingly out of reach. Without change, homeownership in the UK is at risk of becoming the preserve of only the wealthiest young buyers over the next decade. This report should be a wake-up call for industry and the government to think more creatively to keep the homeownership dream alive for the next generation of first-time buyers.\u201d Sard said the average age of a first-time buyer has increased from 25 to 33 years old in the last two decades, and 40% have already started a family. As a result, Santander found that the most sought-after first-time buyer property is now a three-bedroom house. The report, entitled The future of the homeownership dream, also called for the industry and the government to rethink the mortgage market. It said the financial authorities should consider more flexible lending affordability criteria. It has also called on the government to lower stamp duty to incentivise those considering downsizing the family home they have outgrown. Half of the 5,000 non-homeowners aged 18-40 questioned for the survey said that owning their own home was one of their top life goals \u2013 more than having children (27%) or getting married (19%). Santander found that 42% of potential first-time buyers had saved nothing at all towards their first home. Men had saved twice as much as women (\u00a311,660 compared with \u00a35,620), while one in three men and nearly half of women (48%) had not saved anything.",

What everyone remembers most about his Prom debut is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpN2k5zz81o\" title=\"\">the Finnish folk song</a> he played and sang as an encore: with the assurance of a standup comic, he got the Royal Albert Hall audience singing along as he led from the fiddle. \u201cIt was fun. It was the first time I\u2019d performed at the Proms, and I\u2019d only been in the hall once before, to hear Nigel Kennedy. In the second half, people in the audience handed him drinks, and he starting riffing in and out of Jimi Hendrix. He treated it like his living room. So maybe that helped me with the folk music thing.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpN2k5zz81o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gpN2k5zz81o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Perhaps, but it is worth remembering that Kuusisto, 42, wouldn\u2019t have been able to work the Proms audience like that had he not just given such a musically searching and technically brilliant performance of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. That is what makes him such an exciting performer: Kuusisto has impeccable credentials as a serious concert violinist, but is happiest applying them to unclassifiable projects outside the usual classical formulae \u2013 often involving electronics, or improvising, or both. He is the kind of musician who can change the way you think about what you are hearing.</p> <p>As he prepares to return to the Proms, the idea of changing things has been on his mind.

This juxtaposes the humorous children\u2019s concert favourite with text and video showing how unhumorously mankind treats the animals in question. Does he like projects that shock? \u201cNot really. The cancer one was a little scary,\u201d he says, referring to a Wigmore Hall recital last year that mixed Bach\u2019s and his own music with readings from a cancer research scientist and footage of the lab and operating theatre. \u201cBut the idea is to have people leaving the concert feeling freer \u2013 to present them with what they\u2019re afraid of in a way that will allow them to think about it without a sense of doom and gloom.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm wondering when tech is going to be fast and sensitive enough to be able to perform satisfyingly from Finland, for example, to an audience in San Francisco</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Can one musician really change things? \u201cIt\u2019s more a feeling of joining a movement.

      "body": "<p>In a whitewashed studio in northern Denmark, 11 unemployed strangers are embarking on a hearty rendition of Yellow Submarine. Jonas Thrys\u00f8e is not one of them. At least, not yet. The 36-year-old has agoraphobia, rarely leaves the house and can\u2019t think of anything worse than a group singalong. And yet by the second chorus he is putty in the choirmaster\u2019s hands. \u201cI swore I\u2019d just stand at the back and listen,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the mood was infectious.\u201d</p> \n<p>Out of work and in his second year of sick leave because of anxiety and panic attacks, Thrys\u00f8e had become isolated. \u201cI\u2019d avoid situations where I thought I\u2019d get anxious, until I ended up avoiding all situations. It was a vicious circle,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>With a master\u2019s degree in European studies, Thrys\u00f8e had dreamed of a career in Brussels or the Danish government. \u201cBut things got so bad I couldn\u2019t even leave the house. It was \u2026 a kick in the groin,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Then the Kulturvitaminer (culture vitamins) programme came along, offering Thrys\u00f8e and other unemployed people in Aalborg with stress, anxiety or depression the chance to go on a crash culture course. Partly funded by the Danish health authority, and administered by the local jobcentre, the municipalities of Aalborg, Silkeborg, Nyborg and Vordingborg set up pilot schemes to encourage cultural participation for those unemployed or on state sick leave.</p> \n<p>Mikael Odder Nielsen, the Aalborg course leader, says: \u201cWe wanted to see if we could make people\u2019s mental health better, reduce social isolation and help them get back into the labour market via culture.\u201d</p> \n<p>Participants were invited to go on two or three cultural excursions a week for 10 weeks. This appealed to Thrys\u00f8e. \u201cIt was an activity that would get me out of the house, something that wasn\u2019t a medical appointment, where I was treated as \u2018normal\u2019. Because I am not my anxiety, I\u2019m me. And the course helped me feel like \u2018me\u2019 again,\u201d he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"905e50bcd8f87072d8515216860294b4244ce089\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/905e50bcd8f87072d8515216860294b4244ce089/0_336_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a street in Aalborg, Denmark\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aalborg is one of four areas involved in the Kulturvitaminer project.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walter Bibikow/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/17/the-best-things-in-life-are-free-but-where-are-they\">The best things in life are free \u2026 but where are they?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Evy Mortenson, 49, was working in a kindergarten in 2013 when work-related stress resulted in unemployment, followed by periods of ill health and chronic insomnia for the next six years. \u201cBefore I went down with stress, I would often go to concerts and museums,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then I stopped.

      "bodyText": "In a whitewashed studio in northern Denmark, 11 unemployed strangers are embarking on a hearty rendition of Yellow Submarine. Jonas Thrys\u00f8e is not one of them. At least, not yet. The 36-year-old has agoraphobia, rarely leaves the house and can\u2019t think of anything worse than a group singalong. And yet by the second chorus he is putty in the choirmaster\u2019s hands. \u201cI swore I\u2019d just stand at the back and listen,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the mood was infectious.\u201d Out of work and in his second year of sick leave because of anxiety and panic attacks, Thrys\u00f8e had become isolated. \u201cI\u2019d avoid situations where I thought I\u2019d get anxious, until I ended up avoiding all situations. It was a vicious circle,\u201d he says. With a master\u2019s degree in European studies, Thrys\u00f8e had dreamed of a career in Brussels or the Danish government. \u201cBut things got so bad I couldn\u2019t even leave the house. It was \u2026 a kick in the groin,\u201d he says. Then the Kulturvitaminer (culture vitamins) programme came along, offering Thrys\u00f8e and other unemployed people in Aalborg with stress, anxiety or depression the chance to go on a crash culture course. Partly funded by the Danish health authority, and administered by the local jobcentre, the municipalities of Aalborg, Silkeborg, Nyborg and Vordingborg set up pilot schemes to encourage cultural participation for those unemployed or on state sick leave. Mikael Odder Nielsen, the Aalborg course leader, says: \u201cWe wanted to see if we could make people\u2019s mental health better, reduce social isolation and help them get back into the labour market via culture.\u201d Participants were invited to go on two or three cultural excursions a week for 10 weeks. This appealed to Thrys\u00f8e. \u201cIt was an activity that would get me out of the house, something that wasn\u2019t a medical appointment, where I was treated as \u2018normal\u2019. Because I am not my anxiety, I\u2019m me. And the course helped me feel like \u2018me\u2019 again,\u201d he says. Evy Mortenson, 49, was working in a kindergarten in 2013 when work-related stress resulted in unemployment, followed by periods of ill health and chronic insomnia for the next six years. \u201cBefore I went down with stress, I would often go to concerts and museums,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then I stopped. Nothing made me happy or even made sense any more.\u201d After several temporary contracts but no improvement in her health, Mortenson\u2019s caseworker at the jobcentre enrolled her for Kulturvitaminer. \u201cAs soon as I walked into the welcome meeting, I felt a sense of relief. It was a shared experience and there were no expectations, we were just all there together in a judgment-free space,\u201d she says. This was key, because many participants have not taken part in cultural activities for years, if ever, says Nielsen. \u201cIf you are depressed, culture is often the first thing you don\u2019t bother with, you\u2019re too preoccupied with getting through the day. My role is to get them used to this world again, or even introduce it for the first time,\u201d he says.

So spending several hours in a studio, listening to her early records \u2013 as she was recently forced to do, for a compilation of songs from her seven-decade career \u2013 was \u201ckind of torture\u201d, she says. She affects a groan, eyes rolling beneath their spidery lashes.</p> <p>Clark is among the bestselling British female artists of all time, with one of the largest chart spans of any artist in history. She has been on Desert Island Discs three times: in 1951 (when she was just 18); 1982; and 1995. She made her debut as a child entertainer shortly before her tenth birthday in 1942; this October, the month before she turns 87, she will return to the West End as the bird lady in Mary Poppins.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx06XNfDvk0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zx06XNfDvk0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It was in 1964 that she became famous worldwide, with Downtown, the smash hit that beat the Beatles to a Grammy and led her to be anointed \u201cthe First Lady of the British Invasion\u201d. It went to No 1 in the US \u2013 \u201cThere was no escaping it. It cut through absolutely everything\u201d \u2013 and Clark was quickly sucked into the upper echelons of American show business.</p> <p>She worked with Fred Astaire, Dean Martin, Bobby Darin and the Muppets. Steve McQueen, the King of Cool, told her he loved her in a restaurant.

The Carpenters, then unsigned, were performing at the afterparty. Impressed, Clark introduced herself and pointed them out to Herb Alpert, who went on to sign them to A&amp;M. She did not run into Karen often, but \u201cwe had that connection, so that every time we did see each other, we were close\u201d.</p> <p>When Clark and Carpenter \u2013 then the two \u201ctop girls\u201d of the world of pop \u2013 met Elvis Presley in his dressing room after a show, he angled for a threesome, she says. \u201cHe was raring to go. Karen was lovely, but she was kind of innocent. I felt sort of responsible for her, so I got her out of there. Then I looked round, and Elvis was at the door, and he looked at me, like: \u2018I\u2019m going to get you one day.\u2019\u201d But he never did, she tells my voice recorder directly. \u201cSome people think he did.

But when I ask what period of Elvis it was, she jumps at the implication. \u201cOh, it was when he was at his best! But he was almost too much.\u201d</p> <p>After Carpenter died from complications resulting from anorexia in 1983, Clark paid tribute to her \u201cvery dear friend\u201d and her \u201cstrange, tragic end\u201d at the Royal Albert Hall. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d she says now. \u201cI remember from the first time I met her, I saw the different phases of this thing, I could sense that something was going on.

But he was a hard taskmaster.\u201d She whistles, rolls her eyes. \u201cI think that was probably the secret to it. Not a lot of fun, no \u2013 but very, very clever.\u201d Clark says she only had a \u201cnightmare session\u201d with one producer: Bob Crewe. \u201cHe just wanted to make me sound different.\u201d</p> <p>The music industry has come under a lot of scrutiny, for sexual harassment and abuse \u2013 did she ever feel vulnerable, especially as a young woman? She considers the question carefully. Women have changed; the world has, too. \u201cI\u2019ve come across all that stuff, of course.\u201d She pauses for a long time. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into that,\u201d she says softly, almost to herself. Then she recaptures her train of thought. \u201cIt\u2019s right that women should come out and say what has to be said. It\u2019s still a world that\u2019s controlled by men. I think the world would be very different if more women were in power.\u201d</p> <p>Clark was first discovered at age nine on It\u2019s All Yours, a BBC show that broadcast children\u2019s messages for the troops. When rehearsal was interrupted by an air raid, Clark volunteered to sing to settle the jittery audience. She found herself on stage, standing on a box to reach a big, old-fashioned microphone \u2013 the first she had ever sung into, in front of the first orchestra she had ever seen. \u201cI sang, and the orchestra joined in \u2013 just like in a movie. That was the beginning, really.\u201d</p> <p>Billed as \u201cBritain\u2019s Shirley Temple\u201d and \u201cthe Singing Sweetheart\u201d, Clark went on to record hundreds of songs for the forces and toured the UK by train. She recalls sleeping in the luggage racks alongside Julie Andrews, three years her senior. \u201cNow, she could really sing,\u201d says Clark. \u201cWe\u2019d get off the train, do our little things, get back on and go home.

She was a good-luck charm for the troops, her picture plastered on tanks. \u201cI was sweet and had a sweet little voice \u2013 that was all that was asked of me, really.\u201d But her education suffered; when she did make it to school, she was bullied for being famous.</p> <p>Aged about 12, Clark was contracted as an actor by the Rank Organisation, Britain\u2019s largest film company, and remained there through her teenage years. She wanted to be Ingrid Bergman, but there were no roles for adolescents. Her chest was bound as late as age 16, to protect her image as a child star in ankle socks. \u201cI think I was part of a moment in people\u2019s wartime lives that they wanted to keep precious,\u201d she says. \u201cMe becoming a woman \u2013 they didn\u2019t want to see that.\u201d</p> <p>But Clark was growing up and wanted to sing more grown-up songs. \u201cAnd, of course, as soon as I did anything like that, we\u2019d get letters coming in: \u2018We don\u2019t want Our Pet singing about LOVE\u2019. What was I supposed to sing? The Little Shoemaker for ever?\u201d It was a desperately unhappy time \u2013 she has said she came close to a breakdown \u2013 compounded by her fraught relationship with her father Leslie, who was also her manager and a frustrated actor. \u201cHe enjoyed the so-called glamour of it, probably more than I did, and I think he could see me slipping away. It was not easy, for either of us.\u201d</p> <p>Clark eventually terminated their relationship, which, she says firmly, was \u201cnecessary, but not easy\u201d. Does she feel any resentment towards him? She is quiet, stops and starts. \u201cI adored my father. He was my idol for many, many years. This is hard for me to talk about.\u201d There was \u201cnothing weird going on\u201d, she adds hurriedly; \u201cbut when we parted, it was very, very painful\u201d.</p> <p>She was also dismayed to discover that she was broke, her finances having been handled for her during her entire career. \u201cThat was a surprise, put it that way.\u201d But she had two hit records, With All My Heart (1957) and Alone (1958), and, together with her sister, was able to pull together enough for the two of them to rent a flat in London. Now in her mid-20s, Clark was independent for the first time in her life \u2013 she got herself a pink sports car, and \u201cseveral boyfriends\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/11/petula-clark-tony-hatch-how-we-made-downtown\">Petula Clark: how we made Downtown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then she was called across the Channel by her record company, which was irked that a French singer, Dalida, had had some success covering Clark\u2019s songs. After a successful show at the Olympia theatre in Paris, she was persuaded to record in French by the promise of spending time with the record company\u2019s \u201cgorgeous\u201d PR man, Claude Wolff. \u201cThey said: \u2018He\u2019ll be taking you around.\u2019 <em>\u00c7a change tout</em>.\u201d</p> <p>You knew what you wanted when you saw it, I say. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was going to get <em>married</em> to him!\u201d she says. \u201cBut he was kind of dishy.\u201d</p> <p>Clark couldn\u2019t speak French, Wolff couldn\u2019t speak English, and he had an \u201cextremely beautiful\u201d girlfriend (\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand her\u201d). But at the end of her three weeks in Paris, the night before she was due to go back to London, Wolff came to her hotel. \u201cHe said: \u2018You come with me\u2019 \u2013 dot dot dot.\u201d </p> <p>After a long-distance love affair between London and Paris, they decided that she would move to Paris, where her career was taking off. The British press was resentful, accused her of running away from her past. Clark is adamant: she left England because she wanted to be with the man she loved. But \u201cit was nice to get away from being \u2018Our Pet\u2019. The great thing about becoming a star in France was they knew nothing about my past. They thought I was sexy.

Clark has spoken often with regret about her \u201cmother\u2019s guilt\u201d, believing she handled neither parenthood nor her career as well as she could have \u2013 a concern she has expressed to her children. \u201cThey say: \u2018What are you talking about? We had a great time.\u2019\u201d Wolff and nannies shouldered the burden, but it required compromise all round, she says, personally and professionally. \u201cThey weren\u2019t always easy choices \u2013 and leaving the children was always traumatic.\u201d</p> <p>Clark and Wolff have been married 58 years and continue to live together in Geneva \u2013 but now lead mostly separate lives.

      "bodyText": "Petula Clark does not like to look back. She does not celebrate birthdays \u2013 hates nostalgia. So spending several hours in a studio, listening to her early records \u2013 as she was recently forced to do, for a compilation of songs from her seven-decade career \u2013 was \u201ckind of torture\u201d, she says. She affects a groan, eyes rolling beneath their spidery lashes. Clark is among the bestselling British female artists of all time, with one of the largest chart spans of any artist in history. She has been on Desert Island Discs three times: in 1951 (when she was just 18); 1982; and 1995. She made her debut as a child entertainer shortly before her tenth birthday in 1942; this October, the month before she turns 87, she will return to the West End as the bird lady in Mary Poppins. It was in 1964 that she became famous worldwide, with Downtown, the smash hit that beat the Beatles to a Grammy and led her to be anointed \u201cthe First Lady of the British Invasion\u201d. It went to No 1 in the US \u2013 \u201cThere was no escaping it. It cut through absolutely everything\u201d \u2013 and Clark was quickly sucked into the upper echelons of American show business. She worked with Fred Astaire, Dean Martin, Bobby Darin and the Muppets. Steve McQueen, the King of Cool, told her he loved her in a restaurant. Meeting celebrities was exciting, she says, but \u201cthe really great people\u201d stand out \u2013 Quincy Jones was \u201cwonderful\u201d, and she and Harry Belafonte \u201cadored each other\u201d. \u201cI think he kind of fancied me,\u201d she adds, somewhat bashfully.

She recalls sleeping in the luggage racks alongside Julie Andrews, three years her senior. \u201cNow, she could really sing,\u201d says Clark. \u201cWe\u2019d get off the train, do our little things, get back on and go home. It was fun \u2013 and not a lot of kids were having fun.\u201d Vera Lynn was \u201cthe Forces\u2019 Sweetheart\u201d, and Clark was their \u201cLittle Girl\u201d, representing the children they had left behind. She was a good-luck charm for the troops, her picture plastered on tanks. \u201cI was sweet and had a sweet little voice \u2013 that was all that was asked of me, really.\u201d But her education suffered; when she did make it to school, she was bullied for being famous. Aged about 12, Clark was contracted as an actor by the Rank Organisation, Britain\u2019s largest film company, and remained there through her teenage years. She wanted to be Ingrid Bergman, but there were no roles for adolescents. Her chest was bound as late as age 16, to protect her image as a child star in ankle socks. \u201cI think I was part of a moment in people\u2019s wartime lives that they wanted to keep precious,\u201d she says. \u201cMe becoming a woman \u2013 they didn\u2019t want to see that.\u201d But Clark was growing up and wanted to sing more grown-up songs. \u201cAnd, of course, as soon as I did anything like that, we\u2019d get letters coming in: \u2018We don\u2019t want Our Pet singing about LOVE\u2019. What was I supposed to sing? The Little Shoemaker for ever?\u201d It was a desperately unhappy time \u2013 she has said she came close to a breakdown \u2013 compounded by her fraught relationship with her father Leslie, who was also her manager and a frustrated actor. \u201cHe enjoyed the so-called glamour of it, probably more than I did, and I think he could see me slipping away. It was not easy, for either of us.\u201d Clark eventually terminated their relationship, which, she says firmly, was \u201cnecessary, but not easy\u201d. Does she feel any resentment towards him? She is quiet, stops and starts. \u201cI adored my father. He was my idol for many, many years. This is hard for me to talk about.\u201d There was \u201cnothing weird going on\u201d, she adds hurriedly; \u201cbut when we parted, it was very, very painful\u201d. She was also dismayed to discover that she was broke, her finances having been handled for her during her entire career. \u201cThat was a surprise, put it that way.\u201d But she had two hit records, With All My Heart (1957) and Alone (1958), and, together with her sister, was able to pull together enough for the two of them to rent a flat in London. Now in her mid-20s, Clark was independent for the first time in her life \u2013 she got herself a pink sports car, and \u201cseveral boyfriends\u201d. Then she was called across the Channel by her record company, which was irked that a French singer, Dalida, had had some success covering Clark\u2019s songs. After a successful show at the Olympia theatre in Paris, she was persuaded to record in French by the promise of spending time with the record company\u2019s \u201cgorgeous\u201d PR man, Claude Wolff. \u201cThey said: \u2018He\u2019ll be taking you around.\u2019 \u00c7a change tout.\u201d You knew what you wanted when you saw it, I say. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was going to get married to him!\u201d she says. \u201cBut he was kind of dishy.\u201d Clark couldn\u2019t speak French, Wolff couldn\u2019t speak English, and he had an \u201cextremely beautiful\u201d girlfriend (\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand her\u201d). But at the end of her three weeks in Paris, the night before she was due to go back to London, Wolff came to her hotel. \u201cHe said: \u2018You come with me\u2019 \u2013 dot dot dot.\u201d After a long-distance love affair between London and Paris, they decided that she would move to Paris, where her career was taking off. The British press was resentful, accused her of running away from her past. Clark is adamant: she left England because she wanted to be with the man she loved. But \u201cit was nice to get away from being \u2018Our Pet\u2019. The great thing about becoming a star in France was they knew nothing about my past. They thought I was sexy. I thought that was pretty great!\u201d Her marriage to Wolff was unusually feminist for the time: \u201cIt was a partnership.\u201d They had two daughters and a son. Clark has spoken often with regret about her \u201cmother\u2019s guilt\u201d, believing she handled neither parenthood nor her career as well as she could have \u2013 a concern she has expressed to her children. \u201cThey say: \u2018What are you talking about? We had a great time.\u2019\u201d Wolff and nannies shouldered the burden, but it required compromise all round, she says, personally and professionally. \u201cThey weren\u2019t always easy choices \u2013 and leaving the children was always traumatic.\u201d Clark and Wolff have been married 58 years and continue to live together in Geneva \u2013 but now lead mostly separate lives. They have \u201cdrifted apart\u201d, says Clark, gently: \u201cHe has his life and I have mine. How can you talk about that? Personal relationships are complicated, and it\u2019s very difficult to explain that to the world.\u201d Is she happy? She sounds surprised to be asked, stops and starts with her answer. \u201cUm, yeah. You know, happiness \u2013 I actually wrote a song called Happiness.\u201d She pauses, and it takes me a moment to realise that she is quoting song lyrics. \u201cIt comes and goes, it\u2019s like a summer rose, and we settle for contentment and the status quo \u2013 and suddenly it\u2019s there again.\u201d A complete recording of Petula Clark\u2019s 1974 Valentine\u2019s Day concert at the Royal Albert Hall will be released later this year. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 July 2019. An earlier version included a picture of Barbara Hancock in Finian\u2019s Rainbow, miscaptioned as Petula Clark, and has now been replaced.",

      "bodyText": "The British consumer is holding up the country\u2019s economic performance but key sectors are showing signs of strain as Boris Johnson threatens to take the UK out of the EU without a deal, according to a Guardian analysis. In a sign of the mounting stress facing the economy, the pound has slumped to the lowest level against the US dollar for 28 months amid rising fears that Johnson may pursue a no-deal Brexit. The slide in sterling comes as economic growth dips to stalling point. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), a leading thinktank, said this month there is a one-in-four chance the UK has already tipped into recession even before the threat of a disorderly departure on 31 October. Global economic growth is also slowing against the backdrop of the US-China trade war, with the impact spilling back on Britain. However, economic growth has been supported by consumers continuing to spend, despite a slowdown in activity among businesses as they put spending decisions on hold. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), said Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit stance represented the biggest threat to a fragile economy. \u201cCompany bosses continue to warn Johnson against pursuing a no-deal Brexit and he ought to listen. Such a scenario is the biggest downside risk to the UK economy and would be a disaster for living standards,\u201d he said. To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian monitors eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was better than expected. One met its forecast while two fell short of expectations. Presented with the challenge of Brexit alongside the global slowdown, the Bank will update its growth forecasts on Thursday with its quarterly inflation report and a press conference featuring its governor, Mark Carney. Threadneedle Street is expected to keep interest rates at 0.75% until there is greater clarity over Brexit, though economists widely believe the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal would trigger an emergency rate cut. Despite mounting concerns over the path ahead, the latest economic data revealed a mixed picture for Britain. Among bright spots was inflation remaining at the Bank\u2019s target rate of 2% for June and wage growth accelerating at the fastest annual rate since 2008, helping households to strengthen their finances. Consumer spending increased unexpectedly by 1% on the month in June, despite a forecast for a 0.3% contraction among City economists, in a sign that Britons tuned out of the political drama at Westminster. The under-pressure high street also put in a strong performance as retail sales rose by 3.8% on the year, also beating forecasts. However, there were signs of storm clouds gathering. Business surveys revealed a slump in company activity as Brexit uncertainty bites, with both the building and manufacturing sectors falling into contraction. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply showed the service sector barely recorded growth in June, in a sign GDP likely fell in the second quarter. The services sector, which ranges from banking to restaurants and hotels, accounts for around 80% of gross domestic product. Economists warned that activity would probably continue shrinking as the summer turns into autumn, because Johnson ramping up no-deal rhetoric could lead companies to put investment decisions on hold. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the MPC, said growth was slowing as Brexit loomed.

No\u00ebl Coward once remarked on \u201cthe potency of cheap music\u201d, and politics is no different. Labour\u2019s campaigning strategy since 2017 has been predicated on the fact that in Theresa May it faced a mortally wounded and half-hearted foe. Hell, she couldn\u2019t even turn a commanding poll lead into a Commons majority. Of course Corbyn could negotiate a better Brexit! May might name \u201cthe burning injustices\u201d but only Labour would spend the billions to fix them. You can\u2019t say the same of Johnson, who gladly gives Brussels the finger. His strategy is essentially the same as May\u2019s one-time adviser Nick Timothy urged on her: to turn remain v leave into the sole dividing line of our times and so steal blue-collar seats off Labour. Only this time, 11 Downing Street has a chancellor willing to write his cheques.</p> \n<p>Johnson has already scored headlines merely for reheating old promises by George Osborne and May on the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d and on towns \u2013 just wait until he really starts to splash the cash.

Marxist grandpa won\u2019t give you the Brexit you want, will run the new blue message, come with me. Meanwhile, here\u2019s a few million to electrify your train line, or for your local car plant.

So what if the Conservatives lose Richmond Park, as long as they gain Crewe and Nantwich?</p> \n<p>How does Labour fight this? Well, it can ignore Alastair Campbell, who suffers the chronic ailment of the ageing greyback in believing that any story, however big, is always about him. Ditching Corbyn this close to an election will plunge the opposition into chaos. Nor do I put much faith in fact-checking Johnson\u2019s more outrageous claims or past. Much of the public will shrug, believing quite rightly that chameleons are meant to change while bullshitters specialise in bullshit and that their new prime minister is both. Instead, I would suggest three main things.First, it needs to come out wholeheartedly for a second referendum and remain. There is no future in doing anything else against a government that treats no deal as a test of its virility. I have been among those urging Labour not to go along with this hard-right plot to feed the country to the vultures, and frustrated as it tweaks its position every fortnight: enough. If need be, appoint a spokesperson who can argue the case for remain without physically squirming.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/29/jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-brexit\">Jeremy Corbyn, I no longer want to be a member of your Labour party | Alastair Campbell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Second, it needs to go bigger and bolder on its spending commitments, making clear the money will not be disbursed from Westminster solely on big infrastructure projects but will be entrusted to local communities to spend. Every time Johnson promises some spending, Labour should retort: which are you going to believe, his press releases or the devastation you can see on your high street, at your town hall and local food bank? We\u2019ll fix that \u2013 in partnership with you. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has spoken imaginatively about public works, but he should concentrate on putting more money into the pockets of those who have none \u2013 by fixing our broken social security system. That means scrapping universal credit and rolling back the meanness of our means-tested benefits.</p> \n<p>Finally, Labour needs to shrug off its historic complacency about its heartlands. The decline of the trade unions has taken with it a whole tradition of civic labourism that used to turn workers into voters. In Momentum, Corbyn has a self-described social movement that ought to be laying on advice about how to get the benefits you\u2019re entitled to and how to tackle rogue landlords and predatory bosses.</p> \n<p>I share the frustration many have with Labour as it has dragged its feet over antisemitism and Brexit. It has been appalling. But if Johnson gets his way with Brussels and at the next election, that will certainly be the end of any hope of a leftwing government for a generation. Think through the ructions that could follow, and it may mean Labour reduced from a mass party to the kind of shrunken husk German voters now see in the Social Democratic party. The stakes are that big. I return to my starting thought: the task is to beat Boris Johnson and the low dishonesty of his hard-right chumminess.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Every time Johnson promises some spending, Labour should retort: which are you going to believe, his press releases or the devastation you can see on your high street, at your town hall and local food bank? We\u2019ll fix that \u2013 in partnership with you. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has spoken imaginatively about public works, but he should concentrate on putting more money into the pockets of those who have none \u2013 by fixing our broken social security system. That means scrapping universal credit and rolling back the meanness of our means-tested benefits. Finally, Labour needs to shrug off its historic complacency about its heartlands. The decline of the trade unions has taken with it a whole tradition of civic labourism that used to turn workers into voters. In Momentum, Corbyn has a self-described social movement that ought to be laying on advice about how to get the benefits you\u2019re entitled to and how to tackle rogue landlords and predatory bosses. I share the frustration many have with Labour as it has dragged its feet over antisemitism and Brexit. It has been appalling. But if Johnson gets his way with Brussels and at the next election, that will certainly be the end of any hope of a leftwing government for a generation. Think through the ructions that could follow, and it may mean Labour reduced from a mass party to the kind of shrunken husk German voters now see in the Social Democratic party. The stakes are that big. I return to my starting thought: the task is to beat Boris Johnson and the low dishonesty of his hard-right chumminess. \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist",

Tesco says production is once again thriving and is now so strong that \u2013 along with Waitrose \u2013 the supermarket no longer needs to import the fruit during the British season in order to meet customer demand. The UK season is notoriously short \u2013 from mid-June to mid-September, with late-season cherries coming from Scotland.

      "bodyText": "Sterling slides on growing no-deal Brexit risk The pound has sold-off against the euro and the US dollar in the past month, with investors ramping up the sell orders after Boris Johnson entered Downing Street and stepped up the rhetoric over a no-deal Brexit. Sterling has fallen by more than 4% against the US dollar to trade below $1.22 and by almost 3% against the euro to about \u20ac1.09. The slide comes as many Britons head abroad on holiday, hitting them in the pocket. Economists also warn the price of importing goods to Britain will likely rise, pushing up inflation. The US investment bank Morgan Stanley expects the pound could fall to a range of $1-$1.10 if the UK exits the EU without a deal. That would threaten breaching the all-time low of $1.04 reached briefly in early 1985. Stocks rise as US-China trade war cools An easing in tensions between the US and China over trade has helped global equities markets to recover sharply over the past month, driving the FTSE 100 index of top UK companies to the highest levels this year. Expectations of major central banks cutting interest rates has also fuelled a sense of optimism in share dealing rooms. The weaker pound has also driven the FTSE 100 higher, as many firms in the blue-chip index make the bulk of their earnings in foreign currency. The FTSE 100 has risen by about 200 points in the past month to trade around 7,670.

      "body": "<p>On Friday 27 September, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, by then comfortably settled into Downing Street and just five weeks away from the Brexit deadline, would, if he walked out of his front door, find himself faced with an unusual group of protesters.</p> <p>More than 5,000 headteachers from across England are promising to walk out of their schools to take part in a mass march on Westminster to highlight once again the shortfall in education funding that has been making headlines for months if not years. It is their second such protest and there will be more.</p> <p>Such are the difficulties faced by schools that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/04/figures-reveal-english-schools-cant-afford-to-teach-five-days-a-week\">teachers are having to close at lunchtime on Fridays</a> because they can\u2019t afford to teach a full week, teaching jobs and teaching assistant roles are being cut to save money, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-49111807\">parents are being asked to carry out maintenance work, </a>subjects are being cut and headteachers have turned their begging bowls to parents who are being asked to make regular donations to keep their school afloat.</p> <p>Johnson, famously educated at Eton college and Oxford University, has been quick to flag up his concerns about education, promising to reverse the cuts that have blighted England\u2019s schools in recent years with an additional \u00a34.6bn per annum by 2022/23. Opinion varies on how much of an impact his pledges will make, given the scale and deep-seated nature of the crisis schools in England are facing and the lack of detail in the offer.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first time the government has officially recognised what school leaders have been saying for years,\u201d said Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders union NAHT. \u201cThat school funding has been cut in real terms, while at the same time schools have been faced with rapidly rising costs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2019-07-30T12:12:10/embed.html\" data-alt=\"The majority of local authority-maintained schools spent more than their income in 2016-17\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2019-07-30T12:12:10/embed.html\">The majority of local authority-maintained schools spent more than their income in 2016-17</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut schools cannot budget based on warm words alone. There is confusion over what is actually being promised and when. What schools need is a clear and concrete funding plan to be officially announced \u2013 and they need it now.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), is more dismissive. \u201cOur message to Boris Johnson is that, if he is serious about a domestic agenda which includes education as his top priority, we need more than just promises on the side of a bus. We need real money for real pupils in real schools.\u201d</p> <p>The NEU together with the NAHT, the Association of School and College Leaders and the f40 group of lowest-funded local authorities have said an additional \u00a312.6bn is needed by 2022/23 to reverse cuts and provide \u201ca standard of education that society expects\u201d. Johnson\u2019s offer, which fails to address the particularly acute problems in special educational needs and post-16 funding, falls short by quite a margin.</p> <p>The background to the budget crisis in schools, according to the Institute for Financial Studies (IFS), is an <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/13306\">8% real terms cut in funding </a>between 2009/10 and 2017/18. A 2019 <a href=\"https://epi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/School-Revenue-Balances-in-England_EPI.pdf\">report by the Education Policy Institute</a> (EPI) found that almost one in three (30%) local authority maintained secondary schools were in deficit in 2017/18 \u2013 up from just 8% in 2014. At the same time, while pupil numbers have gone up, teacher recruitment and retention has struggled to keep pace. An <a href=\"https://epi.org.uk/publications-and-research/the-teacher-labour-market-in-england/\">earlier EPI report </a>found just 60% of teachers are still working in state-funded schools five years after starting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2019-07-30T12:11:14/embed.html\" data-alt=\"More than a quarter of local authority-maintained secondary schools were in deficit in 2016-17\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2019-07-30T12:11:14/embed.html\">More than a quarter of local authority-maintained secondary schools were in deficit in 2016-17</a> </figure>  <p>Johnson\u2019s education pledges began with a blunder. During the leadership campaign he promised to raise minimum per pupil funding to \u00a35,000 a year in secondary schools and \u00a34,000 in primaries. His aim was to appease Tory MPs who have made life uncomfortable for the government, repeatedly railing against higher funding in (deprived) London at the expense of (less disadvantaged) schools in their constituencies.</p> <p><a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/johnsons-school-funding-pledge-amounts-to-0-1-increase/\">SchoolsWeek calculated that Johnson\u2019s big offer</a> would in fact amount to a tiny sum \u2013 around \u00a350m in extra funding or a 0.1% increase in overall school spending. \u201cThey thought it was a large figure and it turned out to be small,\u201d said Jonathan Simons, who was head of education in the prime minister\u2019s strategy unit when Gordon Brown was prime minister and is now director of education at Public First policy consultancy. \u201cThings are done at speed. You don\u2019t have a huge amount of specialists around. They overestimated the cost of it.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s subsequent commitment to reverse the cuts in per pupil spending and return them to 2015 levels was a much more substantial offer. \u201cThere\u2019s a political driver for this,\u201d said Simons. \u201cEducation is rising up the political agenda \u2013 in polling we know it is one of the top three or four issues for the public. We know in 2017 that a lot of people switched their vote from Conservative to Labour on the issue of schools funding.\u201d</p> <p>The Tories, he says, are obsessed, with winning back the 18 to 24-year-old cohort, and giving more money to schools is part of that.</p> <p>Luke Sibieta, an IFS fellow who has extensively researched education spending, agrees the additional \u00a34.6bn per annum is a significant increase in education funding, and could make a real difference to school budgets and to classrooms. How much of an impact it has depends when the money will be made available and what it will have to cover.</p> <p>\u201cThe \u00a34.6bn is almost set in stone now, particularly now he has mentioned it in the House of Commons. That will be a significant boost to school funding, enough to reverse the 8% cuts since 2010. The big question is when that will occur.

      "bodyText": "On Friday 27 September, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, by then comfortably settled into Downing Street and just five weeks away from the Brexit deadline, would, if he walked out of his front door, find himself faced with an unusual group of protesters. More than 5,000 headteachers from across England are promising to walk out of their schools to take part in a mass march on Westminster to highlight once again the shortfall in education funding that has been making headlines for months if not years. It is their second such protest and there will be more. Such are the difficulties faced by schools that teachers are having to close at lunchtime on Fridays because they can\u2019t afford to teach a full week, teaching jobs and teaching assistant roles are being cut to save money, parents are being asked to carry out maintenance work, subjects are being cut and headteachers have turned their begging bowls to parents who are being asked to make regular donations to keep their school afloat. Johnson, famously educated at Eton college and Oxford University, has been quick to flag up his concerns about education, promising to reverse the cuts that have blighted England\u2019s schools in recent years with an additional \u00a34.6bn per annum by 2022/23. Opinion varies on how much of an impact his pledges will make, given the scale and deep-seated nature of the crisis schools in England are facing and the lack of detail in the offer. \u201cThis is the first time the government has officially recognised what school leaders have been saying for years,\u201d said Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders union NAHT. \u201cThat school funding has been cut in real terms, while at the same time schools have been faced with rapidly rising costs. \u201cBut schools cannot budget based on warm words alone. There is confusion over what is actually being promised and when. What schools need is a clear and concrete funding plan to be officially announced \u2013 and they need it now.\u201d Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), is more dismissive. \u201cOur message to Boris Johnson is that, if he is serious about a domestic agenda which includes education as his top priority, we need more than just promises on the side of a bus. We need real money for real pupils in real schools.\u201d The NEU together with the NAHT, the Association of School and College Leaders and the f40 group of lowest-funded local authorities have said an additional \u00a312.6bn is needed by 2022/23 to reverse cuts and provide \u201ca standard of education that society expects\u201d. Johnson\u2019s offer, which fails to address the particularly acute problems in special educational needs and post-16 funding, falls short by quite a margin. The background to the budget crisis in schools, according to the Institute for Financial Studies (IFS), is an 8% real terms cut in funding between 2009/10 and 2017/18. A 2019 report by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) found that almost one in three (30%) local authority maintained secondary schools were in deficit in 2017/18 \u2013 up from just 8% in 2014. At the same time, while pupil numbers have gone up, teacher recruitment and retention has struggled to keep pace. An earlier EPI report found just 60% of teachers are still working in state-funded schools five years after starting. Johnson\u2019s education pledges began with a blunder. During the leadership campaign he promised to raise minimum per pupil funding to \u00a35,000 a year in secondary schools and \u00a34,000 in primaries. His aim was to appease Tory MPs who have made life uncomfortable for the government, repeatedly railing against higher funding in (deprived) London at the expense of (less disadvantaged) schools in their constituencies. SchoolsWeek calculated that Johnson\u2019s big offer would in fact amount to a tiny sum \u2013 around \u00a350m in extra funding or a 0.1% increase in overall school spending. \u201cThey thought it was a large figure and it turned out to be small,\u201d said Jonathan Simons, who was head of education in the prime minister\u2019s strategy unit when Gordon Brown was prime minister and is now director of education at Public First policy consultancy. \u201cThings are done at speed. You don\u2019t have a huge amount of specialists around. They overestimated the cost of it.\u201d Johnson\u2019s subsequent commitment to reverse the cuts in per pupil spending and return them to 2015 levels was a much more substantial offer. \u201cThere\u2019s a political driver for this,\u201d said Simons. \u201cEducation is rising up the political agenda \u2013 in polling we know it is one of the top three or four issues for the public. We know in 2017 that a lot of people switched their vote from Conservative to Labour on the issue of schools funding.\u201d The Tories, he says, are obsessed, with winning back the 18 to 24-year-old cohort, and giving more money to schools is part of that. Luke Sibieta, an IFS fellow who has extensively researched education spending, agrees the additional \u00a34.6bn per annum is a significant increase in education funding, and could make a real difference to school budgets and to classrooms. How much of an impact it has depends when the money will be made available and what it will have to cover. \u201cThe \u00a34.6bn is almost set in stone now, particularly now he has mentioned it in the House of Commons. That will be a significant boost to school funding, enough to reverse the 8% cuts since 2010. The big question is when that will occur. Schools will be keen to receive it soon, given the pressures they are facing at the moment. The other big question mark is what it will include.\u201d If it has to cover, for example, increases in employer pension contributions, which will cost \u00a31.5bn a year alone, it will disappear rapidly, said Sibieta. There\u2019s also the recent 2.75% pay rise for teachers to fund from September \u2013 the government has so far only agreed to fund 0.75%, the remainder will have to be found by schools. Sibieta said the devil will be in the detail of the Johnson offer, but he agrees with Whiteman that the \u00a34.6bn marks a significant shift by the Conservatives who for years batted off headteachers\u2019 cries for help, insisting record sums were going into schools. \u201cThey are acknowledging there have been big cuts in school budgets \u2013 that\u2019s a big change in itself.\u201d Jules White, headteacher at Tanbridge House School, Horsham, West Sussex and organiser of September\u2019s march on Downing Street, has listened carefully to what Johnson has to offer and says there are currently no plans to call off the protest. \u201cInput of \u00a34.6bn will be welcome but that will only take us back to where we were in 2010,\u201d he said, speaking from a blustery clifftop in Jersey on the second day of his summer holiday. \u201cThe temptation for a short-term fix to quieten heads and parents down will not work. \u201cWe are crying out for long investment \u2013 not only in financial terms but in meaningful integrated decision making too. The question is, will Mr Johnson seize the moment and dare to be different, or tread the same path that has let down our schools and pupils for so long and so badly?\u201d Education in numbers \u00a34.6bn \u2013 the amount Boris Johnson has pledged to increase school funding by per annum by 2022/23; \u00a312.6bn \u2013 the figure teaching unions and school leaders say is required to reverse cuts and provide the education society expects; 8% \u2013 the real-terms cut in school spending per pupil between 2009/10 and 2017/18.",

      "bodyText": "Young people who have grown up in the UK are being forced into destitution as a result of Home Office fees that have more than trebled in the past five years. The cost of renewing an application for a resident with limited leave to remain has increased by 238% in five years \u2013 from \u00a3601 per person in 2014 to \u00a32,033 in January 2019. Let us Learn, which is part of the charity Just for Kids Law, compiled the data as part of a report by young UK migrants about life on the 11-year route to British citizenship. Limited leave to remain is granted to people with a strong connection to the UK including those who have lived in Britain for number of years or who have family or property here. The length of time that some residents must wait before becoming eligible to apply for British citizenship has almost doubled since 2012, from six years to 11 \u2013 pushing thousands of lawful migrants into an increasingly precarious existence. Fees for a limited leave to remain application are applied per person rather than per household, and status must be renewed every 30 months \u2013 meaning that some families are paying tens of thousands of pounds every two and a half years to stay on track. Let Us Learn said it had seen cases where parents were forced to choose which child\u2019s status they could afford to maintain, without enough money to pay fees for the whole family, causing further insecurity. Andrew Noel, 24, has lived in Britain since he was 11, but lost his family home and ended up having to drop out of university due to the changes. Noel had received most of his formal education in Britain and did not realise he would not be eligible for student finance assistance until he applied to university. After his family realised that they needed to apply for limited leave to remain, it took years to save up for the fees.

But he could still have his status revoked at any time if he is unable to keep up with the payments. Some young people have had to resort to crowdfunding to make it through university, or have had to work 40-hour weeks alongside full-time study. The \u00a32,033 fee includes a \u00a31,000 contribution to the NHS, which campaigners have called a double tax. Chrisann Jarrett, who has limited leave to remain and founded Let Us Learn, said: \u201cThe \u00a32,033 cost includes \u00a31,000 for the compulsory health service levy.

      "body": "<p>Ijeoma Moore\u2019s favourite TV programme is Dancing on Ice. Her favourite meal is fish and chips. The only language she speaks is English and she completed all her formal education in Britain. But, according to the Home Office, she is not British.</p> <p>This was something Moore, now 24, realised two days after her 15th birthday \u2013 when she was taken to a deportation centre with her father and her younger brother, then 10.</p> <p>Her father was visiting from Nigeria for her birthday. They were having breakfast and getting ready to make the 15-minute walk to school when there was a loud knock on the door. \u201cMy Dad was suspicious \u2013 nobody knocks at that time, right?\u201d she recalls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/31/leave-to-remain-but-no-home-to-remain-in-after-fees-treble\">Leave to remain \u2013 but no home to remain in after fees treble</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was the UK Border Agency. Its officers put her in the back of a car and Moore sat still, terrified one of her schoolmates would see her.</p> <p>\u201cIt was heartbreaking. I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong and yet I was being treated like a criminal \u2013 my Dad in handcuffs, me and my brother holding back tears,\u201d she said.</p> <p>What ensued was weeks or months \u2013 Moore is unsure \u2013 in a detention centre. She could not speak to her mother or use her laptop or phone. After being released, she was put in foster care. It took her years to reconnect with her mother, who was terrified that she would get her children deported if they reunited.</p> <p>That was in 2010. Moore\u2019s family had overstayed their visas and needed to apply for limited leave to remain. They had a strong connection to the UK \u2013 Moore had lived in the UK since she was two and her mother had worked the whole time they had been there, so they thought the process would be easy.</p> <p>Instead, Moore\u2019s mother spent years saving for lawyers and application fees. She sold jewellery and borrowed from family friends. Once they had the cash, there were setbacks. But, after a few bad lawyers and several failed applications, Moore was finally granted status in 2015.</p> <p>In the past few years, the fees charged to people with leave to remain have shot up \u2013 from \u00a3601 in 2014 to \u00a32,033 in 2019.</p> <p>The time that must pass before people can apply for citizenship after receiving status has also risen \u2013 from six years to 10 \u2013 meaning that Moore\u2019s family would need to save tens of thousands more.</p> <p>The \u00a32,033 charge has to be paid every 30 months by every member in Moore\u2019s family, but they have no idea if it will increase again or by how much. It puts Moore constantly on edge. \u201cThey keep moving the goalposts. It means I can never relax \u2013 I need to save just in case.\u201d</p> <p>If her family were to miss a payment, they would have to start the 10-year-route all over again.</p> <p>In some ways, Moore considers herself lucky: in 2015, the supreme court granted those with limited leave to remain the right to study in the UK with full access to home fees \u2013 exempting students like her from international charges of up to \u00a326,000.</p> <p>But students must have lived here for half of their lives and have been granted leave to remain more than once to be eligible. Moore did not initially meet these requirements, and so had to wait. She watched, depressed, as her contemporaries opened their results and headed off to university.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a blow to the guts,\u201d she says, remembering the sadness of seeing her best friend move on without her.</p> <p>\u201cYou grow up believing that you are entitled to go to university if you work hard enough. I was a brilliant student.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Moore spent a few years volunteering with Let Us Learn and working for children\u2019s charity Coram while she saved towards her second set of fees, which she has just paid.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'If you cut me open, I\u2019d bleed the British flag'</p> <footer> <cite>Ijeoma Moore</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those fees included a \u00a31,000 NHS surcharge. The charge was initially touted as a tax on visiting migrants \u2013 but Moore points out it is something she already pays for in her taxes.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like they view us a source of income. It makes me feel worthless, like I\u2019m not human,\u201d she said.</p> <p>This year, Moore found out that she would finally be heading to university. But the weight of the next set of fees hangs over her. \u201cIt feels never-ending. I\u2019m still going through it \u2013 by the time I graduate I\u2019ll be 30.\u201d</p> <p>She will have to work full-time alongside her second year exams. The uncertainty and the trauma of being detained, she says, has left her with mental health problems.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no flexibility for something to go wrong in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI need therapy. There is so much I\u2019ve been through and it\u2019s still unresolved. Even now, I\u2019m thinking, how is this going to turn out for me? Sometimes I just can\u2019t cope.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what she would say to the Home Office if she had the chance, Moore said: \u201cIf you cut me open, I\u2019d bleed the British flag. Being British is so much more than a piece of paper. I want them to realise that we are young people and we have grown up here. There is nowhere else that we could call home.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ijeoma Moore\u2019s favourite TV programme is Dancing on Ice. Her favourite meal is fish and chips. The only language she speaks is English and she completed all her formal education in Britain. But, according to the Home Office, she is not British. This was something Moore, now 24, realised two days after her 15th birthday \u2013 when she was taken to a deportation centre with her father and her younger brother, then 10. Her father was visiting from Nigeria for her birthday. They were having breakfast and getting ready to make the 15-minute walk to school when there was a loud knock on the door. \u201cMy Dad was suspicious \u2013 nobody knocks at that time, right?\u201d she recalls. It was the UK Border Agency. Its officers put her in the back of a car and Moore sat still, terrified one of her schoolmates would see her. \u201cIt was heartbreaking. I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong and yet I was being treated like a criminal \u2013 my Dad in handcuffs, me and my brother holding back tears,\u201d she said. What ensued was weeks or months \u2013 Moore is unsure \u2013 in a detention centre. She could not speak to her mother or use her laptop or phone. After being released, she was put in foster care. It took her years to reconnect with her mother, who was terrified that she would get her children deported if they reunited. That was in 2010. Moore\u2019s family had overstayed their visas and needed to apply for limited leave to remain. They had a strong connection to the UK \u2013 Moore had lived in the UK since she was two and her mother had worked the whole time they had been there, so they thought the process would be easy. Instead, Moore\u2019s mother spent years saving for lawyers and application fees. She sold jewellery and borrowed from family friends. Once they had the cash, there were setbacks. But, after a few bad lawyers and several failed applications, Moore was finally granted status in 2015. In the past few years, the fees charged to people with leave to remain have shot up \u2013 from \u00a3601 in 2014 to \u00a32,033 in 2019. The time that must pass before people can apply for citizenship after receiving status has also risen \u2013 from six years to 10 \u2013 meaning that Moore\u2019s family would need to save tens of thousands more. The \u00a32,033 charge has to be paid every 30 months by every member in Moore\u2019s family, but they have no idea if it will increase again or by how much. It puts Moore constantly on edge. \u201cThey keep moving the goalposts. It means I can never relax \u2013 I need to save just in case.\u201d If her family were to miss a payment, they would have to start the 10-year-route all over again. In some ways, Moore considers herself lucky: in 2015, the supreme court granted those with limited leave to remain the right to study in the UK with full access to home fees \u2013 exempting students like her from international charges of up to \u00a326,000. But students must have lived here for half of their lives and have been granted leave to remain more than once to be eligible. Moore did not initially meet these requirements, and so had to wait. She watched, depressed, as her contemporaries opened their results and headed off to university. \u201cIt was a blow to the guts,\u201d she says, remembering the sadness of seeing her best friend move on without her. \u201cYou grow up believing that you are entitled to go to university if you work hard enough. I was a brilliant student.\u201d Instead, Moore spent a few years volunteering with Let Us Learn and working for children\u2019s charity Coram while she saved towards her second set of fees, which she has just paid. Those fees included a \u00a31,000 NHS surcharge. The charge was initially touted as a tax on visiting migrants \u2013 but Moore points out it is something she already pays for in her taxes. \u201cI feel like they view us a source of income. It makes me feel worthless, like I\u2019m not human,\u201d she said. This year, Moore found out that she would finally be heading to university. But the weight of the next set of fees hangs over her. \u201cIt feels never-ending. I\u2019m still going through it \u2013 by the time I graduate I\u2019ll be 30.\u201d She will have to work full-time alongside her second year exams. The uncertainty and the trauma of being detained, she says, has left her with mental health problems. \u201cThere is no flexibility for something to go wrong in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI need therapy. There is so much I\u2019ve been through and it\u2019s still unresolved. Even now, I\u2019m thinking, how is this going to turn out for me? Sometimes I just can\u2019t cope.\u201d Asked what she would say to the Home Office if she had the chance, Moore said: \u201cIf you cut me open, I\u2019d bleed the British flag. Being British is so much more than a piece of paper. I want them to realise that we are young people and we have grown up here. There is nowhere else that we could call home.\u201d",

But it is unclear whether the pregnancy will take. Scientists have preserved sperm samples from several male northern rhinos, though they have yet to acquire permission from the Kenyan government to harvest eggs from the two surviving females. Members of Durrant\u2019s team in San Diego are working to circumvent the need to harvest eggs by converting frozen cells preserved from northern white rhinos into stem cells that could develop into sperm and eggs. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to have a self-sustaining herd of pure northern white rhinos,\u201d Durrant said. Right now, the team is working on improving artificial insemination procedures and testing whether each of their southern rhino females is healthy and capable of childbirth and child-rearing.

      "bodyText": "Over the next four months, Australia\u2019s elite sportsmen and women take on the world in a period jam-packed with top-level competition. Starting with the men\u2019s Cricket World Cup, which gets under way in the UK this week, the nation\u2019s elite athletes will contest no fewer than five world cups \u2013 in football, netball, basketball and rugby as well as cricket \u2013 and two Ashes series between now and September. That\u2019s a lot of sport to cram in and the good news is that most of it can be watched live on free-to-air TV in Australia, although given that the majority of events will take place on the other side of the world, actually staying up and watching as it happens may make things tricky. Thank goodness then for the on-demand options. Here\u2019s how you can follow it all on Australian screens and devices. Men\u2019s ICC Cricket World Cup 30 May-14 July Steve Smith and David Warner return following their ball tampering bans as Australia seek to defend their crown in hostile conditions in the UK. As part of an historic deal done with the ICC, which was in place for the 2015 World Cup and will extend to next year\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup on home soil, the Nine Network will show every ball of Australia\u2019s campaign live, plus the semi-finals and final. Fox Cricket has the rights to show every single game of the tournament and through its digital streaming offshoot, Kayo Sports, subscribers will have access to each match on demand as well. Matches to watch out for Saturday 1 June: Australia\u2019s opening game v Afghanistan \u2013 22.30 AEST Tuesday 25 June: England v Australia \u2013 19.30 AEST Sunday 14 July: World Cup final \u2013 19.30 AEST Women\u2019s Fifa World Cup 7 June-8 July Sam Kerr leads Australia to the tournament in France, where the Matildas hope to do better than the quarter-final appearance they managed last time out, four years ago in Canada. In terms of broadcasts, it\u2019s the same initial arrangement as last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup in Russia \u2013 all Australia games will be available live on SBS, while digital subscription service Optus has the rights to every game. Of course, things didn\u2019t pan out quite as planned at the tournament in Russia, and SBS ended up taking on many more games than expected, but Optus appears to have since overcome its technological difficulties and a smooth, incident-free service is expected over the course of the five-week tournament. Last week Optus announced complimentary access to its service will be given to school-aged children. Matches to watch out for Sunday 9 June: Australia\u2019s opening Group C game v Italy \u2013 21.00 AEST Friday 14 June: Australia v Brazil \u2013 02.00 AEST Monday 8 July: World Cup final \u2013 01.00 AEST Netball World Cup 12 July-21 July To be held in Liverpool, in the north-west of England, the Netball World Cup is another tournament which Australia head into as defending champions \u2013 and another where hosts England loom as potential party poopers.

On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/31/fresh-unrest-in-hong-kong-after-44-protesters-charged-with-rioting\">dozens of protesters faced court accused of rioting in the wake of Sunday\u2019s violence.</a></p> <p>In one example, Ann Chiang, a Hong Kong pro-Beijing lawmaker, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chianglaiwan/videos/vb.537711586254667/638471966671514/?type=2&amp;theater\">shared</a> a video of a foreign worker who regularly livestreams the protests and tweets under the name <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HongKongHermit\">Hong Kong Hermit</a>, and questioned why he was at every protest as a \u201ccommander\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HongKongHermit/status/1153349431841832960\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">They\u2019re saying we were pointing and discussing tactics.

He said messages like that \u201creally changed my mind about what\u2019s happening here\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been warned by locals in my neighbourhood that I could be in danger if pro-Beijing people knew that was me in that photo [being circulated],\u201d he added, explaining that the area where he lived was a stronghold for a local pro-establishment party. His wife has asked him if their family is in danger.</p> <p>Even journalists have been targeted. Ta Kung Pao, a Chinese state-owned newspaper based in Hong Kong, described the movements of a New York Times employee as \u201csuspicious\u201d, publishing a photograph of him as well as a close-up image of his phone, showing the text message conversation he was having about the protests with colleagues. Several other state-owned publications ran similar stories.</p> <p>The same Ta Kung Pao article mentioned that Austin Ramzy, a New York Times reporter in Hong Kong, had written \u201c18 reports\u201d, \u201cmost of which have criticised Hong Kong police officers and the HKSAR government while turning a blind eye to the illegal activities of the mobs\u201d. Ramzy later <a href=\"https://twitter.com/austinramzy/status/1155672656043073538?s=21\">commented about the experience</a>.</p> <p>On Monday, the top Chinese government body for Hong Kong and Macau affairs <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2019/jul/29/china-calls-for-hong-kong-swiftly-punish-violent-protesters\">denounced \u201cexternal interference\u201d</a>, accusing western politicians of formulating a \u201cplot\u201d to \u201cdestroy Hong Kong and turn it into trouble for China, thereby restricting or curbing China\u2019s development\u201d.</p> <p>And on Sunday, state-owned media outlet China Daily <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201907/28/WS5d3d9ebda310d83056401621.html\">compared</a> the Hong Kong protests to the revolutions instigated in the Middle East and North Africa, saying that local anti-government actors were \u201ccolluding with external forces to topple governments\u201d.</p> <p>The moves are all part of a strategy, suggested China researcher Adam Ni. \u201cBy blaming the current crisis on outside forces, it negates or neutralises stories about internal troubles,\u201d said Ni.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Westerners living in Hong Kong are being targeted online by China\u2019s state-owned media and local pro-Beijing politicians who have accused them of stoking demonstrations that have now run into their eighth week. Images showing foreign workers at the site of protests are being circulated, sometimes alongside speculative text questioning why they are there. Some images have been circulated so widely that one foreign worker and long-term Hong Kong resident said he was now recognised in the street, including by police. \u201cI now sometimes have to pose for CIA selfies with protesters,\u201d he said, referring to a post which asked if he was a member of US intelligence. The online tactic reinforces the assertion by Beijing that \u201cforeign forces\u201d are behind the protests. On Monday, the People\u2019s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist party, published an editorial warning citizens against \u201cprovoking external forces\u201d that \u201clead the wolves into your home and hurt the country\u201d. The move also comes amid ongoing protests. On Wednesday, dozens of protesters faced court accused of rioting in the wake of Sunday\u2019s violence. In one example, Ann Chiang, a Hong Kong pro-Beijing lawmaker, shared a video of a foreign worker who regularly livestreams the protests and tweets under the name Hong Kong Hermit, and questioned why he was at every protest as a \u201ccommander\u201d. He now fears he might lose his job, or that he might be at risk of getting targeted by either the police or triads. \u201cMy boss now knows about it,\u201d the worker told the Guardian. \u201cAnd an angry cop on Sunday night, between rounds of tear gas, told me he knew who I was as \u2018you are internet famous\u2019. I also wait to see if this makes me more or less at risk of harm from the police at protests.\u201d In another case, an American academic living in Hong Kong, whose name is being withheld to protect his privacy, found out last month that his photo and name were being circulated on social media, along with accusations of instigating violence. After the attacks on protesters by thugs in Yuen Long on 21 July, he received a warning from a friend that the triads \u201cbelieve the narrative about western meddling\u201d, telling him that he\u2019d be targeted. He said messages like that \u201creally changed my mind about what\u2019s happening here\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been warned by locals in my neighbourhood that I could be in danger if pro-Beijing people knew that was me in that photo [being circulated],\u201d he added, explaining that the area where he lived was a stronghold for a local pro-establishment party. His wife has asked him if their family is in danger. Even journalists have been targeted. Ta Kung Pao, a Chinese state-owned newspaper based in Hong Kong, described the movements of a New York Times employee as \u201csuspicious\u201d, publishing a photograph of him as well as a close-up image of his phone, showing the text message conversation he was having about the protests with colleagues. Several other state-owned publications ran similar stories. The same Ta Kung Pao article mentioned that Austin Ramzy, a New York Times reporter in Hong Kong, had written \u201c18 reports\u201d, \u201cmost of which have criticised Hong Kong police officers and the HKSAR government while turning a blind eye to the illegal activities of the mobs\u201d. Ramzy later commented about the experience. On Monday, the top Chinese government body for Hong Kong and Macau affairs denounced \u201cexternal interference\u201d, accusing western politicians of formulating a \u201cplot\u201d to \u201cdestroy Hong Kong and turn it into trouble for China, thereby restricting or curbing China\u2019s development\u201d. And on Sunday, state-owned media outlet China Daily compared the Hong Kong protests to the revolutions instigated in the Middle East and North Africa, saying that local anti-government actors were \u201ccolluding with external forces to topple governments\u201d. The moves are all part of a strategy, suggested China researcher Adam Ni. \u201cBy blaming the current crisis on outside forces, it negates or neutralises stories about internal troubles,\u201d said Ni.",

      "bodyText": "Josh Frydenberg\u2019s eligibility to sit in parliament has been challenged in the court of disputed returns by a constituent who says he feels \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the Liberal party\u2019s inaction on climate change. Michael Staindl, a resident of Kooyong, filed a petition on Wednesday alleging the treasurer and deputy Liberal leader is disqualified by section 44(1) of the constitution because he is a citizen of Hungary, which Frydenberg denies. The allegation on the final day for petitions to be filed against the 2019 election results came on top of two challenges against Liberal MP Gladys Liu in Chisholm and Frydenberg over Chinese language signs that told voters \u201cthe correct voting method\u201d was to put a \u201c1\u201d next to the Liberal candidate. Those challenges were brought by Naomi Hall and independent candidate for Kooyong, Oliver Yates. The petitions \u2013 seen by Guardian Australia \u2013 are the first eligibility challenges of the new parliament, after the 45th parliament was rocked by 14 MPs or senators resigning or being ruled ineligible due to dual citizenship. If successful they could trigger byelections in Kooyong, won by Frydenberg with 55.7% of the two-party preferred vote, and Chisholm, won by Liu with 50.57%. Frydenberg\u2019s mother was born in Hungary in 1943, and he has declared she held Hungarian citizenship from 1943 to 1948, but Frydenberg has denied that he holds citizenship by descent, citing legal advice from Hungarian citizenship law experts, which he has not released. Staindl told Guardian Australia he had \u201cknown Josh for many years\u201d and decided to bring the challenge because \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get action on climate change and he makes you feel well heard but I think he\u2019s consistently betrayed me, the electorate and the country on climate change\u201d. \u201cIn the last parliament he gave assurances [of action on the issue] that weren\u2019t convincing to me at all,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as our legislator, I think he owes us better integrity than that. [Frydenberg] should show us he\u2019s entitled to sit.\u201d Staindl is an IT professional who has volunteered for Melbourne-based environmental group Lighter Footprints. Frydenberg has previously rejected the claim of dual citizenship, arguing \u201cit is absurd to think that I could involuntarily acquire citizenship of a foreign country from a stateless mother and grandparents \u2013 it invokes the North Korean example of conferring citizenship on someone against their will\u201d. Frydenberg has cited immigration entry documents from 1950 that describe his mother as stateless and has argued that his mother is not a Hungarian citizen and that he cannot be by descent. But Staindl\u2019s petition claims Frydenberg\u2019s mother \u201carrived in Australia in 1950 in possession of a valid passport, inferred to be a valid Hungarian passport\u201d. It claimed Frydenberg\u2019s mother \u201ccontinued to be a citizen of Hungary after 1948\u201d, making him a citizen by descent. The challenges by Hall and Yates argue the Chinese-language signs were \u201clikely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote\u201d in breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Hall\u2019s petition notes that more than 20% of voters in Chisholm speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home and are likely to be able to read Chinese; in Kooyong the figure is about 12%. The case argues that as a consequence of the signs some voters were likely to have voted 1 for Liu \u201cnotwithstanding that such was not the vote that they otherwise intended to cast\u201d. \u201cHad it been the elector\u2019s intention to direct his or her first preference to a candidate other than Liu, that intention was not realised,\u201d the petition said. On election day Liu defended the signs, telling Sky News they were \u201cgood signs\u201d authorised by the party. The acting state Liberal director, Simon Frost, has told Guardian Australia the signs were \u201cproperly authorised as required by the Commonwealth Electoral Act\u201d. The Australian Electoral Commission inspected the signs on election day and concluded they were authorised. It concluded they were not misleading or deceptive, relying on a high court precedent that the prohibition is limited to the process of filling in a ballot paper, not influencing how voters formed their decision. Earlier in July, Victorian lawyer Trevor Poulton \u2013 who has written a novel called The Holocaust Denier but says he is not antisemitic \u2013 said he was considering a challenge against Frydenberg on the basis of alleged dual citizenship. On 18 July, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was asked about that putative challenge and accused Poulton of seeking to advance an antisemitic agenda \u201cby pretending to have some sort of constitutional purity on Josh Frydenberg\u201d. At that time Frydenberg said the citizenship issues \u201cwere dealt with comprehensively through the last parliament, and the Coalition is confident that none of its members or senators have issues in that regard\u201d. \u201cNo one should deny what was an appalling and tragic event in world history,\u201d he said. Staindl said he noted \u201cwith great alarm and grief that whenever this issue is raised [Frydenberg] raised the Holocaust denier cannons and fires in every direction\u201d. \u201cThis has nothing to do with denial of the Holocaust, it is simply a matter of whether he is an Australian citizen only.\u201d Staindl said if Frydenberg shows evidence he is not Hungarian he could drop the case, \u201cotherwise, yes, I\u2019ll see it through\u201d.",

Warren, in particular, repeatedly clashed with <strong>John Delaney </strong>over whether her plans were \u201crealistic.\u201d But she pushed back by arguing the country was in need of bold change.</li> \n   <li>Sanders landed a couple of memorable lines that were reminiscent of the energy from his 2016 campaign. While defending the specifics of his Medicare-for-all proposal, he snapped, \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u201d And he slammed Trump as a \u201cpathological liar.\u201d</li> \n   <li>None of the candidates who needed a breakout moment tonight seemed to capture one. Candidates like Delaney, <strong>John Hickenlooper, Tim Ryan </strong>and<strong> Steve Bullock </strong>were looking for a moment or issue to energize their campaigns and catapult them to the fall debate. But there\u2019s no indication that happened.</li> \n   <li><strong>Marianne Williamson</strong>\u2019s answers about race, particularly regarding <strong>slavery reparations</strong>, seemed to spur more interest in her campaign. She was the most-searched candidate during the debate, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/1156393498079350784\">according to Google</a>.</li> \n   <li>The CNN moderators\u2019 insistence on abiding by time limits seemed to stifle the debate, repeatedly cutting off competitors mid-argument. And it didn\u2019t seem to accomplish its intended goal. An <a href=\"https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1156401358788059137\">initial count</a> by the Washington Post indicated that Sanders and Warren spoke about twice as much as Williamson and Hickenlooper.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The Guardian team will be back with more coverage tomorrow night, so make sure to tune back in for our live updates and analysis from Detroit.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d4118e58f08d0b6ca53afe3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T04:33:00.241Z\">5.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From the post-debate spin room, actually a tent. Congressman <strong>Tim Ryan</strong> of Ohio was asked what it will take to beat<strong> Donald Trump</strong>. \u201cI think it takes somebody who can connect to the working class,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our connection in a lot of ways to the working class and we\u2019ve got to have a big vision for the country.<br><br>\u201cI really think aspiration about the future of the country is going to win the day and I tried to provide that today about manufacturing jobs and really winning the future around electric vehicles and some of these other opportunities that we have. That\u2019s going to be really important because Trump has no plan.

So that\u2019s an exciting change for us.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">The church remains an antidote to divisive politics, Kelly added. \u201cOne of the nice things about being a downtown parish is that on any given Sunday, especially during an election cycle, I\u2019m going down the rail handing out communion to somebody who works for the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republican</a></strong> candidate and somebody who works for the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democratic</a></strong> candidate and somebody who works for the <strong><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/20/libertarianvotersinthenews\">Libertarian</a></strong> and somebody who works for the <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Green party</strong>.

I think that you\u2019ll see a real focus both on local and statewide issues in the debate: things like the environment and clean water, the automobile industry, manufacturing, infrastructure.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T23:31:58.717Z\">at 12.31am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d40bc918f08cf92bb77a139\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-30T22:20:56.441Z\">11.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Candidates are sharing behind-the-scenes looks at the debate stage in Detroit before the main event kicks off in less than two hours.</p> \n  <p>From former Maryland congressman <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/13/john-delaney-don-quixote-american-dream-president-2020\">John Delaney</a></strong>: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JohnDelaney/status/1156321656492740608\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ready for tonight.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me tonight, but I\u2019ll be back with more live coverage from Detroit for tomorrow\u2019s debate. Here are some of the key takeaways from tonight: Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren formed a tag team against the more moderate candidates to defend their progressive proposals. Warren, in particular, repeatedly clashed with John Delaney over whether her plans were \u201crealistic.\u201d But she pushed back by arguing the country was in need of bold change. Sanders landed a couple of memorable lines that were reminiscent of the energy from his 2016 campaign. While defending the specifics of his Medicare-for-all proposal, he snapped, \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u201d And he slammed Trump as a \u201cpathological liar.\u201d None of the candidates who needed a breakout moment tonight seemed to capture one. Candidates like Delaney, John Hickenlooper, Tim Ryan and Steve Bullock were looking for a moment or issue to energize their campaigns and catapult them to the fall debate. But there\u2019s no indication that happened. Marianne Williamson\u2019s answers about race, particularly regarding slavery reparations, seemed to spur more interest in her campaign. She was the most-searched candidate during the debate, according to Google. The CNN moderators\u2019 insistence on abiding by time limits seemed to stifle the debate, repeatedly cutting off competitors mid-argument. And it didn\u2019t seem to accomplish its intended goal. An initial count by the Washington Post indicated that Sanders and Warren spoke about twice as much as Williamson and Hickenlooper. The Guardian team will be back with more coverage tomorrow night, so make sure to tune back in for our live updates and analysis from Detroit. From the post-debate spin room, actually a tent. Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio was asked what it will take to beat Donald Trump. \u201cI think it takes somebody who can connect to the working class,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our connection in a lot of ways to the working class and we\u2019ve got to have a big vision for the country. \u201cI really think aspiration about the future of the country is going to win the day and I tried to provide that today about manufacturing jobs and really winning the future around electric vehicles and some of these other opportunities that we have. That\u2019s going to be really important because Trump has no plan. Trump operates in a 24 hour news cycle and that\u2019s dangerous and it puts us way behind the eight ball when it comes to winning the future.\u201d Asked by the Guardian whether the Democrats can bury their differences and unite around the eventual nominee, Ryan insisted: \u201cI think so. We\u2019re all pretty much anybody but Trump.\u201d Meanwhile Marianne Williamson was asked about her debate prep. \u201cI\u2019m trying to keep up on the issues and learn,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve read a lot and I\u2019m learning a lot and I\u2019ve also been a political activist for a long time so it\u2019s not like I woke up one day and decided I wanted to be interested in politics.\u201d Elizabeth Warren doubled down on her argument that she has a more stirring pitch to become president than her more moderate competitors. In an interview after the debate, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper replayed the clip of Warren saying she didn\u2019t understand why some candidates entered the race \u201cjust to talk about what we really can\u2019t do and shouldn\u2019t fight for.\u201d \u201cI think that\u2019s fair and right,\u201d Warren said of the clip. She said she knew exactly why she was getting into the race when she launched her campaign and wants to embrace bold change. \u201cWe can\u2019t be the party of little changes from where we are right now,\u201d Warren said. In her post-debate messaging, Elizabeth Warren has zeroed in on her argument that Democrats need to embrace a candidate with bold ideas. The fact that Warren appeared to so successfully deploy that message during the debate points to a weakness among more moderate candidates, as a New York Times reporter noted: Marianne Williamson\u2019s answers about race during the debate have particularly captured a lot of attention. The self-help author, who has embraced slavery reparations as a key plank of her campaign platform, said that her proposal represented a \u201c$200 to $500 billion payment of a debt that is owed.\u201d \u201cAnd I believe that anything less than $100 billion is an insult,\u201d Williamson added. \u201cAnd $200 to $500 billion is politically feasible today because so many Americans realize there is an injustice that continues to form a toxicity underneath the surface, an emotional turbulence that only reparations will heal.\u201d Speaking to a CBS News reporter, Amy Klobuchar took issue with the notion that proposals from more moderate candidates were not \u201cbold enough.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think you should mistake the fact that we have different views as that we\u2019re not bold enough. That part of it really bothers me,\u201d Klobuchar said. The Minnesota senator emphasized that she and other moderates were still standing up for average Americans. \u201cI think we do a disservice when people are saying that that\u2019s not fighting,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fighting. You\u2019ve just got a different way you want to do it.\u201d In contrast, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign has been advertising this quote from the Massachusetts senator\u2019s debate performance, which you can expect to soon appear on a t-shirt: After a bruising takedown by Elizabeth Warren, someone edited John Delaney\u2019s Wikipedia page to falsely declare his death. While this is obviously untrue \u2013 the Maryland moderate is very much alive \u2013 this edit was live on the encyclopedia site for a short while, as detailed by its own revisions tracker. In case you missed it, this was the moment: Here are some snap verdicts on the winners of tonight\u2019s debate from online pundits and campaigners across the political spectrum: And in case you were wondering who the Trump campaign called it for.... Marianne Williamson has once again put in a strong showing \u2013 at least as far as Google searches go. The search engine giant reported shortly after the debate ended that Williamson was the most-searched Democratic candidate as the event unfolded, followed by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The number of searches about Williamson is even more impressive given how much she spoke during the debate. According to the Washington Post, she and John Hickenlooper were the only two candidates who spoke for less than nine minutes over the two and a half hours. Sanders and Warren got about twice as much attention, each speaking for nearly 18 minutes during the debate. John Delaney is ... keeping the dream alive. Despite some initial negative reviews of his performance tonight, the former Maryland congressman said he has \u201cno plan to drop out\u201d of the race. Delaney\u2019s staffers have encouraged him to exit the race by mid-August because he hasn\u2019t had a \u201creal breakout moment,\u201d Axios reported earlier this month. And there is no indication tonight provided Delaney such a moment. The biggest question going into tonight\u2019s debate was whether Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders would attack each other in the hope of emerging as the race\u2019s top progressive candidate. After two and a half hours of debate, the answer to that question was a very clear \u201cno.\u201d Warren and Sanders instead faced off against the more moderate candidates on the stage, touting their progressive proposals on everything from Medicare-for-all to decriminalization of border crossings. The lack of tension between Warren and Sanders is not all that surprising given their longtime alliance in the Senate. But it\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ll be able to maintain that cordial relationship for the September debate, when many of the moderate candidates will have likely dropped off. The homepage headlines right now for three of America\u2019s leading newspapers demonstrate how much tonight\u2019s debate was dominated by ideological clashes between the progressive and more moderate candidates. The New York Times: \u201cDebate highlights rift between moderates and progressives.\u201d The Washington Post: \u201cLiberal-moderate divide emerges on core issues.\u201d The Wall Street Journal: \u201cFree college divides Democratic candidates.\u201d John Delaney clearly came itching for a fight with his progressive opponents, and he got one \u2013 particularly when it came to his exchanges with Elizabeth Warren. But there was a hefty amount of skepticism online as to whether that strategy would actually aid Delaney\u2019s minimal prospects in this race. Environmental advocates are already criticizing the short shrift given to the climate crisis in tonight\u2019s debate. \u201cFollowing the first debate in June \u2014 in which just 6 percent of questions over two nights addressed climate change policy \u2014 we heard just one candidate, Elizabeth Warren, outline their vision for implementing a Green New Deal,\u201d Greenpeace USA said. Here are the key climate moments from tonight: Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both criticized John Hickenlooper and more moderate Democrats for not being aggressive enough on the climate crisis. \u201cI get a little tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas,\u201d Sanders said, accusing fossil fuel companies of \u201ccriminal activity.\u201d Elizabeth Warren spoke of her proposal to boost green manufacturing and jobs. \u201cNo one wants to talk about it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you want to do instead is find the Republican talking point.\u201d Hickenlooper said Sanders\u2019 support of the Green New Deal is a \u201cdisaster at the ballot box,\u201d adding that \u201cyou might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump.\u201d Steve Bullock said progressive proposals might hurt workers, and Sanders countered the Green New Deal is \u201ca bold idea\u201d that can \u201ccreate millions of good paying jobs.\u201d Pete Buttigieg said none of it matters if Democrats don\u2019t win the White House: \u201cWe have all put out highly similar visions on climate. It is all theoretical,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will deal with climate if and only if we win the presidency, if and only if we beat Donald trump.\u201d Jay Inslee vowed he won\u2019t let climate go undiscussed in tomorrow\u2019s debate, which also features Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Greenpeace USA\u2019s senior climate campaigner Jack Shapiro said putting climate on the backburner \u201cis an insult to those dealing with extreme heatwaves, storms, and droughts right now and to future generations for whom everything is at stake.\u201d The Democratic National Committee has refused to host a climate-focused debate, although warnings from scientists that the world has about 11 years to prevent irreversible climate damage and the US government\u2019s own analysis concludes rising temperatures threaten the economy and public health. But MSNBC and CNN will each hold climate forums in September. That wraps up night one of the Democratic debates here in Detroit. Stay tuned for more analysis from the Guardian team. Marianne Williamson, who once again seems to have won Twitter\u2019s \u201cmost fascinating\u201d award, used her closing statement to advocate for \u201cradical truth-telling\u201d and demand a \u201cserious conversation about race.\u201d John Delaney, who spent the bulk of his time onstage going after Elizabeth Warren, took another swipe at progressive candidates with his closing statement. He said he endorsed \u201creal solutions, not impossible promises.\u201d Tim Ryan told the audience he hoped he had \u201ccaptured your imagination,\u201d prompting some puzzled looks in the press room here in Detroit. John Hickenlooper was just happy to be here. \u201cWhat a night. I loved it,\u201d he said. Amy Klobuchar invoked the opioid crisis with her closing statement, promising to go after the pharmaceutical industry as president. Beto O\u2019Rourke offered an endorsement of bipartisanship, noting that he did surprisingly well with Republican voters in his Texas Senate race against Ted Cruz last year. (O\u2019Rourke still lost.) Pete Buttigieg may say that he doesn\u2019t care how old anyone is, but he noted in his closing statement he would soon be in his 40\u2019s as America starts to feel the effects of these proposals. Elizabeth Warren said that this election is about \u201cwho\u2019s going to get opportunity.\u201d Bernie Sanders pledged to stand by the US middle class, recounting his recent trip to Canada to emphasize the high price of insulin in America. The Internet is still cackling over this moment earlier, when Elizabeth Warren rubbed her hands with glee at the mention that John Delaney would be affected by her wealth tax: CNN host Don Lemon posed the moderators\u2019 last question of the night, which effectively boiled down to: does age matter? Lemon noted that 40 years separate the 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg from the 77-year-old Bernie Sanders. \u201cI don\u2019t care how old you are. I care about your vision,\u201d Buttigieg said in response to Lemon\u2019s question. But he then seemed to qualify that a bit by advocating for a \u201cnew generation of leaders.\u201d Sanders seconded Buttigieg\u2019s initial point that vision matters over age, going on to tout many of his progressive proposals. Kirsten Gillibrand, who will participate in tomorrow night\u2019s debate, slammed the CNN hosts for not asking a question about reproductive rights or paid family leave. The two issues have been central to the New York senator\u2019s campaign: Pete Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan, committed to withdrawing all US troops from the country by the end of his first year in office. \u201cWe will withdraw. We have to,\u201d Buttigieg said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re pretty close to waking up to the news of a casualty in Afghanistan of someone who was not born on 9/11.\u201d The Sanders campaign is already starting to fundraise off his \u201cI wrote the damn bill\u201d moment Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign is touting her comments condemning white supremacy as domestic terrorism. The candidate\u2019s Twitter account reshared this: Donald Trump remains uncharacteristically silent about the debate but his garrulous son, Donald Trump Jr, has been weighing in. Among his tweets: \u201cPeople are gonna think that I\u2019m trolling but compared to what else is up on this stage I think Marianne Williamson is actually winning this thing,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThis is amazing. No question she seems to be drawing the biggest applause of the night.\u201d Expect to see and hear a lot more of Don Jr during the 2020 election campaign. He has become, by some estimations, an effective surrogate and speaker at rallies, adept at throwing red meat to the base. CNN host Jake Tapper asked Bernie Sanders where he diverged from Donald Trump on foreign policy, given that both of them have said the US should not serve as the policeman of the world. \u201cTrump is a pathological liar. I tell the truth,\u201d Sanders said defiantly. But he added that he stood by his belief that America should not serve as the world\u2019s policeman. Bernie Sanders is really throwing caution to the wind when it comes to answering moderators\u2019 questions. The Vermont senator seems to have his own list of points he wants to make and appears to have taken the hosts\u2019 questions as simply suggestions. Asked just now about his student debt plan, he instead focused on income inequality, somewhat returning to the debate between Elizabeth Warren and John Delaney moments ago on taxing the wealthy. Elizabeth Warren is defending her proposed taxes on the wealthiest Americans, saying it would help to \u201cstart to close the wealth gap.\u201d John Delaney shot back that all of the candidates were in favor of higher taxes on the wealthy, but Democrats needed to find a realistic way of enacting them. He added that Warren\u2019s proposed taxes were \u201carguably unconstitutional.\u201d Asked about the lead water contamination crisis in Flint, Marianne Williamson called it \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d \u201cWe have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act. We have communities -- particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities -- all over this country who are suffering from environmental injustice.\u201d She attributed the inequity to racism and the \u201cdark underbelly of America.\u201d She said what happened in Flint would never happen where she lived in Grosse Pointe, an affluent suburb of Detroit. Amy Klobuchar quickly pivoted to her infrastructure plan, saying she would spend $1 trillion on water, roads and rural broadband. She criticized Donald Trump for promising an infrastructure package on election night and so far failing to follow through. John Delaney answered the tariff question by specifically criticizing Elizabeth Warren\u2019s trade policy proposals. The former Maryland congressman seems dead set on picking as many fights with Warren as possible. Delaney said Warren\u2019s plan would prevent the United States from even trading with the United Kingdom. Warren responded that her plan would simply force US trade partners to \u201craise their standards\u201d before being able to sell products here. CNN host Don Lemon returned from the commercial break by asking candidates whether they would continue Donald Trump\u2019s steel tariffs. Tim Ryan said Trump was \u201con to something when he talked about China,\u201d arguing that the country dominates too much of the global market. But Lemon pushed Ryan specifically on whether he would continue the tariffs. \u201cHe\u2019s bungled the whole thing,\u201d Ryan admitted of Trump. The Guardian\u2019s environment reporter Emily Holden writes: Democrats tonight split over how ambitious a plan to fight the climate crisis they should pursue, with some worrying about proposing something that Republicans can\u2019t agree to or that would hurt workers. Moderator Dana Bash posed the first climate question of the night late into the night, asking John Delaney why he finds the Green New Deal to be \u201cunrealistic.\u201d Both Delaney and John Hickenlooper criticized what they see as impossible plans for extensive spending on a green economy to fight rising temperatures. Delaney backs a tax on carbon emissions with dividends returned to taxpayers. Hickenlooper is governor of Colorado, a major oil state. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren punched back. \u201cI get a little tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas,\u201d he said, accusing fossil fuel companies of \u201ccriminal activity.\u201d Elizabeth Warren slammed them for shooting down her proposal to boost green manufacturing and jobs. \u201cNo one wants to talk about it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you want to do instead is find the Republican talking point.\u201d When Steve Bullock suggested voters might see progressive proposals as hurting workers, Sanders disagreed. \u201cIt\u2019s a bold idea. We can create millions of good paying jobs. We can rebuild communities in rural america that have been devastated. So we are not anti-worker,\u201d Sanders said. Pete Buttigieg shot for the middle: \u201cWe have all put out highly similar visions on climate. It is all theoretical, he said. We will deal with climate if and only if we win the presidency, if and only if we beat Donald trump.\u201d The candidates are now debating reparations for slavery, which has been a major campaign plank for Marianne Williamson. Invoking the civil war-era promise of \u201cforty acres and a mule,\u201d Williamson argued that the US had to face its history of racism by embracing reparations. Asked why he didn\u2019t support cash reparation payments, Bernie Sanders cited other policies he did support, including representative Jim Clyburn\u2019s 10-20-30 plan to combat poverty. This is the moment Warren delivered the biggest blow of the night so far: Twitter has now started to resemble more of a ringside crowd than a debate one: When asked about how he would appeal to African American voters, Pete Buttigieg said that, as an \u201curban mayor,\u201d \u201cthe racial divide lives within me.\u201d The comment comes as Buttigieg has faced criticism back home in South Bend, Indiana, after a black man was shot and killed by a white police officer. This was the moment Bernie Sanders delivered the first big zinger of the night: It has delighted both his supporters and those looking for some debate drama tonight: The night so far in pictures: Some of those watching the debate have been taking issue with the framing of some of CNN\u2019s questions so far, particularly on healthcare and immigration: This is from Sanders\u2019 press secretary: Some people are even less happy: Bernie Sanders accused his more moderate competitors of being \u201cafraid of big ideas.\u201d \u201cRepublicans are not afraid of big ideas,\u201d Sanders said, citing the GOP\u2019s tax overhaul that is expected to substantially increase the deficit. \u201cSo please don\u2019t tell me we can\u2019t take on the fossil fuel industry,\u201d Sanders added. Tim Ryan kicked off his response with an admonishment to Sanders. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to yell,\u201d the Ohio congressman said. CNN host Dana Bash posed the first climate change question of the night, nearly 90 minutes into the debate. John Delaney kicked off the question by explaining why he considers the Green New Deal unrealistic, instead supporting a carbon tax. Elizabeth Warren then defended the Green New Deal, of which she is a co-sponsor. So far tonight, many of the most heated back-and-forth exchanges have occurred between Warren and Delaney. They\u2019ll likely feature prominently in any highlight reel from tonight\u2019s debate. So far, Sanders and Warren have been dominating tonight\u2019s conversation, according to The Washington Post\u2019s calculations. Sanders has spoken for 9.4 minutes and Warren for 8.4 minutes, while Ryan trails on 3.8 minutes, and Williamson has spoken for just 3.4 minutes Elizabeth Warren defended the electability of progressives like herself and Bernie Sanders by arguing Democrats need to find someone who they can be passionate about. \u201cDemocrats win when we figure out what is right and we get out there and fight for it,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI am not afraid.\u201d When John Delaney once again accused her and Sanders of endorsing \u201cfairytale economics,\u201d Warren shot back that she didn\u2019t know why people run for president \u201cjust to talk about what we really can\u2019t do and shouldn\u2019t fight for.\u201d As the debate returns from a commercial break, the conversation is once again centered on the question of electability. CNN host Jake Tapper asked John Hickenlooper whether he considered Bernie Sanders \u201ctoo extreme\u201d to beat Donald Trump. In response, Hickenlooper predicted the progressive policies Sanders espoused would be a bridge too far for many Americans. \u201cYou might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump,\u201d Hickenlooper said. Sanders shot back that many polls in key battleground states show him beating Trump in a hypothetical match-up. Tim Ryan then weighed in by noting, \u201cHillary Clinton was winning in the polls, too.\u201d Nearly halfway through tonight\u2019s debate, Democrats have mentioned the climate crisis only briefly in their opening statements. Moderators have asked no climate questions, even though the climate crisis topped the list of subjects CNN readers want to hear about the most. More people voted for climate than for economy, health care and immigration -- which have so far dominated the debate. It\u2019s also worth noting that the climate crisis threatens economic growth, will exacerbate many health problems and is already driving migration. The candidates also did not bring up the environmental problems plaguing Michigan, including the lead water crisis in Flint. Here are the three main climate mentions: John Hickenlooper said his states attacked climate change head on. Pete Buttigieg noted that science shows the world has 12 years to prevent irreversible damage from climate change. (That\u2019s now 11 years.) Bernie Sanders slammed the fossil fuel industry for taking subsidies and tax breaks while they \u201cdestroy this planet,\u201d in the same breath he vowed to take on Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cracism, his sexism, [and his] xenophobia.\u201d Marianne Williamson also said insufficient policies on chemicals, foods and the environment are leading to people getting sick. Steve Bullock said money in politics is preventing action on many challenges, including the climate crisis. One hour into the debate, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have been largely unified as they face off against the more moderate candidates on the stage. Many wondered going into the debate whether Sanders and Warren would try to differentiate themselves from each other, given that they are the highest-polling candidates in tonight\u2019s group. But the division has so far been pretty clearly defined by moderates versus progressives. And a Politico reporter also noted this as we entered the second hour of the debate: Elizabeth Warren and Steve Bullock got into a debate that was about both immigration and Democrats\u2019 broader strategy about how to take on Trump. \u201cYou are playing into Donald Trump\u2019s hands,\u201d Bullock said of Warren\u2019s progressive policies, arguing that the current president was the biggest problem when it came to immigration. \u201cA sane immigration system needs a sane leader,\u201d Bullock said. Warren shot back that Bullock was turning a blind eye to Trump\u2019s most controversial policies. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is ignore the wall,\u201d Warren said. Democratic candidates seem to be taking the CNN hosts\u2019 questions as suggestions for the direction of discussion rather than an actual rubric. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both used questions about immigration to denounce Trump\u2019s policies, largely ignoring the hosts\u2019 specific questions on the issue. The conversation has shifted to immigration, with the first question posed to Pete Buttigieg about decriminalizing border crossings. Beto O\u2019Rourke noted that he disagreed with Buttigieg, who favors the decriminalization of border crossings. Elizabeth Warren then jumped in to argue that the decriminalization statute made the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy possible. \u201cWe must be a country that every day lives our values,\u201d Warren said. Elizabeth Warren jumping to the defence of Bernie Sanders over Medicare for All has delighted many Twitter users watching the debate. Meanwhile, Warren\u2019s response to the Medicare for All criticisms \u2013 calling them \u201cRepublican talking points\u201d \u2013 also has been well-received among some Democrats, including a former Obama campaign manager: Bernie Sanders has returned to the debate stage with the fire that animated his 2016 debate. When pushed about the specifics of his Medicare-for-all bill, Sanders snapped, \u201cI wrote the damn bill.\u201d Marianne Williamson said criticisms of Medicare-for-all are \u201cnot just a Republican talking point.\u201d Pete Buttigieg then jumped in to argue it was \u201ctime to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just stand up for the right policy,\u201d the millennial mayor said. Jake Tapper has so far been vigilant about keeping candidates to the time limits that CNN is trying to enforce. That technique may help each candidate receive a more proportionate time of camera attention, but it has also made for a choppy debate with candidates repeatedly being cut off mid-point. A HuffPost reporter asked this question about Tapper\u2019s approach: Beto O\u2019Rourke is now promising that taxes will not be raised on the middle class to insure more Americans. Getting into a debate with Steve Bullock on the issue, O\u2019Rourke said other plans would leave too many Americans uninsured. Elizabeth Warren described in detail of how a man with ALS has struggled to pay his medical bills to explain the necessity of her health care plan. Apparently responding to laughter in the audience when she returned to his story, Warren said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d From a Washington Post columnist: Well, it looks like John Delaney\u2019s strategy was at least somewhat successful. After releasing a statement just before the debate slamming Medicare-for-all, he was quickly given an opportunity to describe his own policy. He then got drawn into a back-and-forth with Bernie Sanders about whether to end private insurance. Jumping into the debate, Elizabeth Warren said Democrats are not trying to take health care away from anyone and accused those who said otherwise of adopting a Republican talking point. The first question, posed by Jake Tapper, goes to Bernie Sanders about Medicare for all. Tapper specifically mentioned fellow candidate John Delaney\u2019s criticisms of the policy. Asked what he would say to Delaney, Sanders responded simply, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d eliciting applause from the Detroit crowd. Elizabeth Warren came out strong with a denunciation of the Oval Office\u2019s current occupant. \u201cDonald Trump disgraces the office of president every single day,\u201d Warren said. The Massachusetts senator emphasized that any of the Democrats onstage would make a better president than Trump and slammed his as the beneficiary of a rigged system. No espa\u00f1ol? Former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke used his opening statement to promise he would help Americans \u201crealize our full potential.\u201d But unlike the first debate, he stuck with English for his opening comments, surely disappointing many on the Internet. Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper joined Delaney in attacking the front-running candidates on the stage as supporting unrealistic policies. Although Hickenlooper ignored mentioning Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren by name, he was clearly criticizing their progressive proposals. Former Maryland congressman John Delaney has come out swinging by accusing candidates like Bernie Sanders of promising \u201cfree everything.\u201d Delaney also put out a statement just before the debate slamming Sanders for his health care proposals, so you can see a theme building here. After a brief opening commercial break, the debate is on. Moderator Jake Tapper went through the rules and issued the sure-to-be-disregarded instruction to the audience not to interrupt the discussion by cheering. Opening statements have started with Montana governor Steve Bullock, who has unsurprisingly emphasized he won three elections in a red state. The decision by Democrats to hold a presidential debate in Michigan falls into a pattern that has seen the party invest in states lost by Hillary Clinton in 2016. Although the state swung in Donald Trump\u2019s favor by a narrow margin of 11,000, Clinton was the first Democratic presidential candidate to lose the state in 28 years. She was also narrowly defeated by Bernie Sanders in the Michigan Democratic primary, which marked a major upset for her campaign and in retrospect foreshadowed Clinton\u2019s challenges ahead. Working class voters, faced with the decline of manufacturing and industrial jobs, played a significant role in propelling Trump to victory. Local officials have cautioned Democrats that for any candidate to pass muster, a clear platform on healthcare, trade and jobs will be of utmost importance. But for Democrats to succeed, winning back working class white voters is not the only priority. Candidates have also focused on inner-city issues, such as affordable housing, and drawn attention back to the Flint water crisis, while campaigning near Detroit. The city is 83% black, meaning any debate among Democrats on income inequality will have to account for race and the systemic barriers before people of color. The candidates are taking the stage, and the Guardian team is here to provide updates and analysis as we go. Tonight\u2019s debate will start at 8pm ET and go until around 10:30pm. CNN is hosting and broadcasting the debate, but the network is allowing viewers to stream the debate without a cable subscription on their homepage. The same three CNN anchors \u2013 Dana Bash, Don Lemon and Jake Tapper \u2013 will host both nights. The network has made the (wise) decision not to switch out moderators in the middle of the debate, which led to some very noticeable technical difficulties for NBC News last month. Like the NBC debates, only one of the moderators (in CNN\u2019s case, Jake Tapper) is a white man. But oddly, because of CNN\u2019s random drawing to determine the debate line-up, all of the participants tonight are white. The format of the debates is very similar to last month\u2019s, with candidates getting 60 seconds to answer a moderator-directed question and 30 seconds for responses and rebuttals. Candidates who are attacked by name by an opponent will also get 30 seconds to respond. And a series of flashing lights \u2013 from yellow to solid red \u2013 will warn them when their time is running out. CNN specifically ruled out the possibility of show of hands or one-word questions, much to the relief of many viewers and likely to the disappointment of NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd. The network also warned candidates that anyone who consistently interrupts others\u2019 answers will have his or her time reduced. During last month\u2019s debates, several candidates repeatedly interjected their own thoughts on questions that weren\u2019t posed to them. But it\u2019s hard to blame them when they\u2019re trying to differentiate themselves from more than 20 other people. DNC chairman Tom Perez addressed the debate crowd in Detroit and specifically called out Trump\u2019s recent attacks on Baltimore and representative Elijah Cummings. \u201cWe believe in Baltimore,\u201d Perez told the crowd to applause. \u201cWe believe in Elijah Cummings.\u201d Over the weekend, Trump launched a racist attack on Cummings, the chairman of the House oversight committee, and his majority-black district by ridiculing Baltimore as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are as a nation,\u201d Perez said. One thing to keep in mind looking at the crowded debate stage tonight: this won\u2019t be happening again this election cycle. Because of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s heightened requirements for the fall debates, far fewer candidates are expected to qualify in September. In order to make the cut for this week\u2019s debates, candidates had to either attract at least 1 percent of support in three separate polls or receive contributions from 65,000 unique donors. But for the September debate, the DNC has both doubled each requirement and made both of them necessary to qualify. So every candidate who debates in the fall has to have both registered at 2 percent or more in four polls and received contributions from 130,000 donors. Only seven candidates have so far crossed both thresholds: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Cory Booker. Andrew Yang announced yesterday that he had met the polling requirement after already crossing the donor threshold, but the DNC threw cold water on that today by sending out an email saying it would not accept one of the polls Yang had cited. Two other candidates \u2013 Juli\u00e1n Castro and Amy Klobuchar \u2013 have met one requirement but not the other. All other candidates have failed to clear either hurdle, so this could be the last debate for many of them. That possibility is sure to weigh heavily tonight on the candidates who have failed to gain any traction in the race. Former Maryland congressman John Delaney has started the sparring off early with a statement criticizing Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all plan, noting that the Vermont senator \u201cisn\u2019t even a Democrat.\u201d \u201cSenator Sanders\u2019s plan to turn our health care system into a socialist experiment isn\u2019t just bad policy, it\u2019s bad politics,\u201d Delaney said in a statement. \u201cIt would all but guarantee that Donald Trump gets re-elected. Senator Sanders isn\u2019t even a Democrat and we shouldn\u2019t let lead our party down a path that will mean we lose to Donald Trump.\u201d Delaney, who has so far failed to meet either requirement for the fall debate, is likely hoping attacking Sanders will buy him some extra camera time. This may, after all, be his last chance to leave an impression on voters. His staffers have asked him to drop out of the presidential race by mid-August, Axios reported earlier this month. More candidates participating tonight are preparing for the debates with tunes and tributes to loved ones. From Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor: And from former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper: The main attraction tonight is the duel on the left between septuagenarian senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. In football or soccer terms, it\u2019s like a local derby. Could it turn nasty? Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, said: \u201cThe key $10,000 question is whether the friendship lasts for the two hours of the debate because they\u2019re colleagues and they have not gone negative with each other on the campaign trail. When you get on the stage under the bright lights, it could certainly change. \u201cI think Sanders has the incentive to do that, frankly, because he fared much better in the last cycle. He\u2019s slipping to almost single digits now. If anyone needs to make a move and have the focus on the campaign it\u2019s Sanders and, by going negative against Warren, that could be the way.\u201d Kall, editor of the book Debating the Donald, added: \u201cI think she would be hesitant to respond and we saw in the first debate there were many instances where she could have interjected herself forcefully into the debate but she kind of disappeared for an hour. So if she doesn\u2019t respond, it could be successful for him and put some more spotlight on him, which has been lacking in the last several weeks or months of this campaign.\u201d The debate\u2019s proximity to Flint, Michigan, has thrown a spotlight on the need for candidates to better flesh out their plans to ensure safe drinking water and fight environmental racism. Candidates have been generally vague about how they plan to tackle these issues. Here are some of the exceptions experts tracking the campaigns note: Kamala Harris this week released her campaign\u2019s plan to fight environmental racism. She would score federal proposals for their impacts on vulnerable communities. And in the Senate, the California lawmaker proposed legislation to invest nearly $220 billion in drinking water. Washington\u2019s governor, Jay Inslee, this week introduced his climate justice plan, for \u201censuring that every American working family and community is included, and none are left behind, as the U.S. transitions off of fossil fuels.\u201d In that plan he would also ban PFAS chemicals. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey also introduced a bill to allow states to use existing funds to pay for lead problems. Elizabeth Warren wants to reinstate an Obama-era rule called Waters of the US that governed which waterways were regulated by the federal government. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some candidates talk about water in more or less vague terms. There\u2019s definitely people who have talked about the need to invest in water infrastructure \u2013 Biden, Inslee, Harris, Buttigieg. Right know those are just kind of top level \u2018yes, we need to invest in water infrastructure,\u2019\u201d said Madeleine Foote, the League of Conservation Voters\u2019 deputy legislative director. These debates will give candidates the chance to get into the details behind those promises. Here is the full list of candidates participating tonight: Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who is trying to recreate the enthusiasm of his impressive 2016 bid by advocating for progressive policies like Medicare-for-all. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who has a plan for every problem and whose progressive bona fides could pose a threat to Sanders. Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor of South Bend, Indiana, whose bid enjoyed a burst of interest in the spring but has since somewhat stagnated. Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman who was treated as a liberal darling when he ran against Republican senator Ted Cruz last year but has yet to find his footing in the presidential race. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who has presented herself as the most pragmatic opponent against Donald Trump given her popularity in her Midwestern state. Marianne Williamson, the self-help author and spiritual guru whose \u201clove over hate\u201d message captured the Internet\u2019s fascination during her first debate performance. John Delaney, the former Maryland congressman whose claim to fame is mostly that he\u2019s been running for president the longest of the debate crowd (since July 2017, to be specific). John Hickenlooper, the popular former governor of Colorado who has been repeatedly urged to throw in the towel and run for the Senate instead. Tim Ryan, the Ohio congressman who stumbled in his first debate appearance during an exchange with Tulsi Gabbard over foreign policy. Steve Bullock, the Montana governor who is making his debate debut after narrowly failing to qualify last time around. Sanders and Warren \u2013 and to a lesser degree Buttigieg \u2013 have a significant polling advantage compared to the other candidates, who will mainly be trying to have a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d moment capable of launching them to the next debate. But more on that later. Detroit has an inauspicious place in debate history. It hosted a Republican primary contest in 2016 in which Donald Trump made reference to the size of his manhood. Candidate Marco Rubio had mocked Trump\u2019s hand size ahead of the debate. The future president did not let it lie. \u201cLook at those hands, are they small hands?\u201d he asked the audience. \u201cAnd he referred to my hands, \u2018If they\u2019re small something else must be small.\u2019 I guarantee you there\u2019s no problem, I guarantee it.\u201d Even though some are desperate for a break-through moment, it is hard to imagine any Democrat going to quite such lengths. Democrats are debating in Detroit tonight in the shadow of multiple environmental crises \u2013 including the lead drinking water contamination in Flint, Michigan. Several of the White House contenders have visited the still-troubled city, including former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee this week. Around the country, drinking water supplies are threatened by lead, fluorinated chemicals, agricultural runoff and algal blooms. Michigan has seen all of those problems. Campaign watchers expect to hear more on water quality tonight and tomorrow. Erik Olson \u2013 the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund\u2019s senior advisor on toxics and drinking water \u2013 said he wants to hear \u201creally detailed plans for how they\u2019re going to address the underlying problem, which is underinvestment in our drinking water supplies and our water infrastructure,\u201d and a \u201cfailure of regulation and enforcement.\u201d The CNN debates have offered Detroit a chance to show off its downtown regeneration. The Rev Steven Kelly, rector of St John\u2019s Church \u2013 close to a new arena and new Google office \u2013 said: \u201cThis parish has gone from being primarily folks coming in from the suburbs to people riding their bikes to church, and this neighbourhood has not seen that in probably 40 years. So that\u2019s an exciting change for us.\u201d The church remains an antidote to divisive politics, Kelly added. \u201cOne of the nice things about being a downtown parish is that on any given Sunday, especially during an election cycle, I\u2019m going down the rail handing out communion to somebody who works for the Republican candidate and somebody who works for the Democratic candidate and somebody who works for the Libertarian and somebody who works for the Green party. We leave our problems at the door and and we all pray and worship together and then maybe we have an intense discussion at coffee hour, but I try to discourage it.\u201d With Michigan\u2019s status as a vital swing state, local issues could figure prominently in the debates. Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, said: \u201cLast time the election was decided by only 11,000 votes; it could be integral to determining the winner in 2020. In the city of Detroit specifically there were so many tens of thousands of voters who did vote for President Obama but just sat it out, whether it was Hillary Clinton fatigue or she didn\u2019t spent enough time here. \u201cThose are voters they are really trying to reactivate and get that Obama coalition back to win the state, and they had a lot of success with that in 2018 \u2013 the governor, every statewide office, several Congress races went Democratic \u2013 and so they want to follow up on that momentum to make Michigan part of that blue wall again to prevent Trump from winning re-election. I think that you\u2019ll see a real focus both on local and statewide issues in the debate: things like the environment and clean water, the automobile industry, manufacturing, infrastructure.\u201d Candidates are sharing behind-the-scenes looks at the debate stage in Detroit before the main event kicks off in less than two hours. From former Maryland congressman John Delaney: And from Montana governor Steve Bullock: Hi, live blog readers! This is Joanie Greve reporting from Detroit, where the next round of Democratic debates is set to start at 8pm EDT. Ten of the 20 candidates participating in the debates, which are hosted by CNN, will appear on the debate stage tonight. The others will face off tomorrow night. The blog will have more on each of the candidates as we prepare for the debate to start, but if you need more of a refresher on any of them (no one would blame you), Lauren Gambino and Sam Morris created this helpful graphic back in January. In the meantime, here is Cardi B, who just threw her support behind Bernie Sanders, encouraging you to tune in: Sanders\u2019 Twitter account reshared that message, but the senator himself would not reveal his favorite Cardi B song to a Yahoo News reporter earlier today:",

Put a hand on her and she\u2019d probably scream rape.\u201d \u201cThe attraction of the stories is that they\u2019re unpretentious, and that\u2019s a deeply Australian trait,\u201d says the series creator, Morgan O\u2019Neill. \u201cMaybe their attraction now is that we\u2019re a little in danger of becoming self-serious. I don\u2019t know.\u201d O\u2019Neill shares directorial duties with Jocelyn Moorhouse, David Caesar and Fadia Abboud. The script has added characters: Doreen and Dolores, both played by Rebel Wilson, and Les\u2019s male flatmate Wozza is reworked as Lozza, played by Kate Box. Several of the series\u2019 remaining male characters were based on amalgams of real \u201ccolourful\u201d Sydney identities. The most obvious among these is the illegal casino operator Price Galese, played by David Wenham, whose enemies end up \u201cswimming about five miles off Sydney heads, with a couple of car batteries for swim flippers\u201d. The character, who pays off police and politicians, was based partly on the late illegal Sydney casino operator Perce Galea. Wenham says he read a biography about Galea in preparation and found it \u201cjaw-dropping, really, when you realise he was allegedly paying the [then] premier of NSW $10,000 a week in brown paper bags\u201d, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d But Wenham found reading the Les Norton books troubling. \u201cIt was a bit of a chore, because although there\u2019s great humour and they\u2019re wonderful source material, there\u2019s a whole heap of stuff that, to put it bluntly, is offensive these days. So the creators have done a pretty fine job taking the jewels out of the piece and letting the rest slide by.\u201d Alexander Bertrand, who plays Les, says he\u2019s basing his characterisation on an ocker Queenslander he met while shooting a beer commercial last year. He says the show has an \u201coutrageous, heightened reality\u201d and \u201ceverything that was wrong with the books is what Les questions in the television series ... The new-age Les is definitely a lot more earnest.\u201d There are, however, still punch-ups, that Les would call \u201cBalmain folk dancing up and down someone\u2019s rib cage\u201d or a \u201cWoolloomooloo upper-cut to the balls\u201d. People still go missing and end up in concrete footings. Hunter Page-Lochard is basing his character, the boxer Billy Dunne, on the swagger of African-American boxer Sugar Ray Leonard. Billy is specified as an Indigenous character, but Page-Lochard emphasises: \u201cI get to be a larrikin; I get to be an Aussie. It\u2019s not so much Indigenous. I get to be Billy.\u201d \u201cBob Barrett was an equal opportunity shit-stirrer,\u201d says O\u2019Neill, who argues the author\u2019s work personified the Australian notion of larrikinism. \u201cIn the books he has a crack at everyone: white guys, black guys, gay, straight, fat, skinny, left, right, men, women. But it\u2019s all done with a sense of kindness, if that makes sense. \u201cThere are parts where you go, \u2018Whoa, thank god we\u2019ve moved on from there.\u2019 But that\u2019s part of the thrill of making television in 2019 from books set in 1985. We can subtly comment upon how far we\u2019ve come, in so many good ways.\u201d \u2022 Les Norton premieres on ABC TV at 8.30pm on Sunday 4 August \u2022 This article was amended on 5 August to include David Caesar in the directorial credits",

Otters and seals frequent this little cove and, when they\u2019re not in residence, its deep, tidal rockpools stocked with urchins and hermit crabs make for an agreeable afternoon of window shopping.</p> <p>This time, however, we found the waters crowded when we got there \u2013 not with people but with sleek, dark-eyed seals. I counted half a dozen or more, all of whom seemed so surprised to see us that they paused in whatever they had been doing, to approach and eye us curiously.</p> <p>Perhaps the most pleasurable thing about observing seals is that they always seem just as intrigued by us as we are in them. Small faces popped up, and then retreated, their spaniel-eyes wet and imploring, questioning. I felt tempted out of the humid Skye summer and into the brine, to join the selkie-folk myself.</p> <p>But we couldn\u2019t hold their attention for long. Over on the other side, some kind of rumpus resumed: a series of splashes and dives; flashes of seal rump and tail; a wild spectacle punctuated at intervals by bloodcurdling moans. Horrifying sounds \u2013 more sea monster than seal familiar \u2013 that started low and growling, in the back of the throat, and trailed away into a death-gasp. Immediately, it drew the attention of our nearby seals. They turned to look, then vanished into the deep.

In July, males take to the water to perform competitive athletic displays: flipper slapping, rolling and \u201clobbing\u201d (lifting their tails in the air then splashing them down). Around 20 years ago, scientists realised that they were producing loud underwater vocalisations in tandem with these performances \u2013 roaring their dominance for all to hear. Well, not all: we landlubbers were likely only getting the tail-end of it.</p> <p>A privilege, then, to catch a glimpse into the workings of their complex social lives. I picked my way over weed-strewn rocks to take up a front-row seat.</p>",

      "bodyText": "From the Armadale pier, there\u2019s a trail that leads through woodland down to the rocky inlet at Rubha Phoil. Otters and seals frequent this little cove and, when they\u2019re not in residence, its deep, tidal rockpools stocked with urchins and hermit crabs make for an agreeable afternoon of window shopping. This time, however, we found the waters crowded when we got there \u2013 not with people but with sleek, dark-eyed seals. I counted half a dozen or more, all of whom seemed so surprised to see us that they paused in whatever they had been doing, to approach and eye us curiously. Perhaps the most pleasurable thing about observing seals is that they always seem just as intrigued by us as we are in them. Small faces popped up, and then retreated, their spaniel-eyes wet and imploring, questioning. I felt tempted out of the humid Skye summer and into the brine, to join the selkie-folk myself. But we couldn\u2019t hold their attention for long. Over on the other side, some kind of rumpus resumed: a series of splashes and dives; flashes of seal rump and tail; a wild spectacle punctuated at intervals by bloodcurdling moans. Horrifying sounds \u2013 more sea monster than seal familiar \u2013 that started low and growling, in the back of the throat, and trailed away into a death-gasp. Immediately, it drew the attention of our nearby seals. They turned to look, then vanished into the deep. Something more pressing. Now, having asked around, I believe we stumbled across the summer mating ritual of the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina). In July, males take to the water to perform competitive athletic displays: flipper slapping, rolling and \u201clobbing\u201d (lifting their tails in the air then splashing them down). Around 20 years ago, scientists realised that they were producing loud underwater vocalisations in tandem with these performances \u2013 roaring their dominance for all to hear. Well, not all: we landlubbers were likely only getting the tail-end of it. A privilege, then, to catch a glimpse into the workings of their complex social lives. I picked my way over weed-strewn rocks to take up a front-row seat.",

M\u0101oris make up 14.1% of the population, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nz.html\">CIA World Factbook website</a>. </p> <p>On their website, Oranga Tamariki states: \u201cWe are aware that tamariki [children] M\u0101ori are disproportionately affected and represent the largest group of children that come into our care.\u201d The most common reasons babies are taken into care are substance abuse and addiction of parents, medical neglect of the baby, and family violence.</p> <p>Meanwhile a standoff between activists and developers continued at Ihum\u0101tao. Hundreds of protesters have occupied land in the South Auckland suburb of Mangere which is slated for a major private housing development.</p> <p>The M\u0101ori settlement of Ihum\u0101tao dates back to the 14th century, when vegetable gardens were established by Polynesian settlers. Amid a growing Auckland housing crisis, land at Ihum\u0101tao was sold to Fletcher Building in 2016, with plans to develop 500 residential homes. Protesters occupying the site say Ihum\u0101tao is too precious to lose to development, but M\u0101ori groups are not united in their opposition, with some close to Ihum\u0101tao saying the housing development could be good for their families. Well-respected elders accompanied police last week asking for the occupation to end.</p> <p>The chief executive of Fletcher Building Residential, Steve Evans, said the company had committed to returning 25%, or eight hectares, of the land back to M\u0101ori and the building project would take due care with the significance of Ihum\u0101tao.</p> <p>However, the numbers at Ihum\u0101tao have continued to swell, with people travelling from around the country to join, and many taking time off work and children out of school to participate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/26/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-accused-by-maori-of-lacking-leadership-in-land-dispute\">Ihum\u0101tao: Jacinda Ardern accused by M\u0101ori of 'lacking leadership' in land dispute</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The voting support of the M\u0101ori people is significant for Ardern\u2019s Labour party, and expectations are high for the coalition government to deliver for M\u0101ori. A number of senior cabinet members are of M\u0101ori descent.</p> <p>Ardern has spent most of the week in the remote New Zealand territory of Tokelau, a 22-hour sea journey from Samoa and 3,500km from New Zealand.</p> <p>Ardern\u2019s visit to Tokelau is the first appearance by a New Zealand prime minister in 14 years, and Ardern said it was important to show her face to the 1,500 New Zealand citizens and to consult them on whether they wished to move towards independence.</p> <p>But back in New Zealand, anger has been growing at the state of child welfare. Activists say the state intervention in M\u0101ori families reeks of racism and a dark colonial legacy, reminiscent of Australia\u2019s \u201cstolen generation\u201d. An open letter titled \u201cHands off our Tamariki\u201d has been signed by more than 17,000 people.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.handsoffourtamariki.org.nz/\">The letter reads</a>: \u201cSuccessive governments have been seriously remiss in fulfilling its obligations to our people. We must challenge the state abuse of tamariki and wh\u0101nau, past, present and future. There has been too much inaction for too long.\u201d</p> <p>Last month the children\u2019s commissioner, judge Andrew Becroft, launched an investigation into Oranga Tamariki, saying he was deeply disturbed by the routine removal of M\u0101ori children.</p> <p>\u201cOur enduring legacy of colonisation and contemporary systemic racism has long affected decisions made by not only child welfare services, but all New Zealand agencies for decades. There\u2019s no getting away from it. It\u2019s a confronting message for New Zealand, but it\u2019s one we can\u2019t avoid and we\u2019ve got to face up to it,\u201d Becroft said.</p> <p>Dame Tariana Turia, former co-leader of the M\u0101ori party, was one of the protesters who marched on parliament house on Tuesday, and called the child removals \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. Turia was removed from her mother as a baby.</p> <p>Oranga Tamariki chief executive Gr\u00e1inne Moss acknowledged the protest groups but said: \u201cWe all want the same thing \u2026 and that\u2019s for children and young people to be safe and loved.\u201d</p> <p>At the Ihum\u0101tao standoff, Ardern has asked developer Fletcher Building to halt work until a solution can be reached. While<strong> </strong>the company has obliged, the prime minister has been criticised for failing to visit the site. Protesters said they wanted the government to buy the land and preserve it \u2013 a proposal the crown said would set an unsustainable precedent. Acting prime minister Kelvin Davis said the government\u2019s M\u0101ori MPs were on standby to travel to Ihum\u0101tao in Ardern\u2019s absence.</p> <p>Protest leader Pania Newton described Ihum\u0101tao as \u201cthe revolution of our generation\u201d.</p> <p>Since taking office in 2017, Ardern has frequently been accused of being more focused on the international stage than domestic affairs. This perception has been exacerbated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/jul/19/jacinda-ardern-prime-minister-of-australasia-if-only-it-was-that-simple\">her global popularity</a> and frequent media appearances, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2019/jul/29/why-meghan-markles-vogue-is-bang-on-trend\">including one in the upcoming September issue of Vogue.</a></p>",

The M\u0101ori settlement of Ihum\u0101tao dates back to the 14th century, when vegetable gardens were established by Polynesian settlers. Amid a growing Auckland housing crisis, land at Ihum\u0101tao was sold to Fletcher Building in 2016, with plans to develop 500 residential homes. Protesters occupying the site say Ihum\u0101tao is too precious to lose to development, but M\u0101ori groups are not united in their opposition, with some close to Ihum\u0101tao saying the housing development could be good for their families. Well-respected elders accompanied police last week asking for the occupation to end. The chief executive of Fletcher Building Residential, Steve Evans, said the company had committed to returning 25%, or eight hectares, of the land back to M\u0101ori and the building project would take due care with the significance of Ihum\u0101tao. However, the numbers at Ihum\u0101tao have continued to swell, with people travelling from around the country to join, and many taking time off work and children out of school to participate. The voting support of the M\u0101ori people is significant for Ardern\u2019s Labour party, and expectations are high for the coalition government to deliver for M\u0101ori. A number of senior cabinet members are of M\u0101ori descent. Ardern has spent most of the week in the remote New Zealand territory of Tokelau, a 22-hour sea journey from Samoa and 3,500km from New Zealand. Ardern\u2019s visit to Tokelau is the first appearance by a New Zealand prime minister in 14 years, and Ardern said it was important to show her face to the 1,500 New Zealand citizens and to consult them on whether they wished to move towards independence. But back in New Zealand, anger has been growing at the state of child welfare. Activists say the state intervention in M\u0101ori families reeks of racism and a dark colonial legacy, reminiscent of Australia\u2019s \u201cstolen generation\u201d. An open letter titled \u201cHands off our Tamariki\u201d has been signed by more than 17,000 people. The letter reads: \u201cSuccessive governments have been seriously remiss in fulfilling its obligations to our people. We must challenge the state abuse of tamariki and wh\u0101nau, past, present and future. There has been too much inaction for too long.\u201d Last month the children\u2019s commissioner, judge Andrew Becroft, launched an investigation into Oranga Tamariki, saying he was deeply disturbed by the routine removal of M\u0101ori children. \u201cOur enduring legacy of colonisation and contemporary systemic racism has long affected decisions made by not only child welfare services, but all New Zealand agencies for decades. There\u2019s no getting away from it. It\u2019s a confronting message for New Zealand, but it\u2019s one we can\u2019t avoid and we\u2019ve got to face up to it,\u201d Becroft said. Dame Tariana Turia, former co-leader of the M\u0101ori party, was one of the protesters who marched on parliament house on Tuesday, and called the child removals \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. Turia was removed from her mother as a baby. Oranga Tamariki chief executive Gr\u00e1inne Moss acknowledged the protest groups but said: \u201cWe all want the same thing \u2026 and that\u2019s for children and young people to be safe and loved.\u201d At the Ihum\u0101tao standoff, Ardern has asked developer Fletcher Building to halt work until a solution can be reached. While the company has obliged, the prime minister has been criticised for failing to visit the site. Protesters said they wanted the government to buy the land and preserve it \u2013 a proposal the crown said would set an unsustainable precedent. Acting prime minister Kelvin Davis said the government\u2019s M\u0101ori MPs were on standby to travel to Ihum\u0101tao in Ardern\u2019s absence. Protest leader Pania Newton described Ihum\u0101tao as \u201cthe revolution of our generation\u201d. Since taking office in 2017, Ardern has frequently been accused of being more focused on the international stage than domestic affairs. This perception has been exacerbated by her global popularity and frequent media appearances, including one in the upcoming September issue of Vogue.",

In a strongly worded statement issued at the end of a Pacific Islands development forum in Fiji, the leaders said they were deeply concerned about a lack of \u201ccomprehension, ambition or commitment\u201d from developed nations despite the climate crisis posing grave consequences for their people. They called for greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced immediately, pointing to the \u201cstark warnings\u201d in a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change setting out what would need to be done to limit global heating to 1.5C. \u201cThe science warns of the real possibility that coral atoll nations could become uninhabitable as early as 2030,\u201d the statement, called the Nadi Bay declaration, said. \u201cBy 2100, the coral atoll nations of the republic of the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Tokelau and the Maldives and many [small island developing states] could be submerged.\u201d Last week Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, rejected calls from Pacific states for Australia to do more to combat climate change, telling the ABC they \u201cshould be pleased\u201d that it was meeting the target it set at the 2015 Paris meeting.

Australia\u2019s emissions have risen year on year since the Coalition repealed a national carbon price scheme. In a clear reference to Australia, the statement called on the countries to refrain from using carry-over credits from the Kyoto protocol to meet targets under the Paris agreement. Other developed countries have said they will not use carry-over credits, which Australia has access to after over-achieving compared with its Kyoto agreement target of a 5% cut below 2000 levels. Analysts say using these credits effectively reduces Australia\u2019s Paris commitment by about eight percentage points. Climate campaigners say the credits do nothing to escalate efforts to combat the problem as is required and Australia has access to carry-over credits only because it set itself unambitious Kyoto targets. The statement signed by nine leaders also called on coal producers \u201cto immediately cease any new mining of coal and develop a strategy for a decadal phase-out and closure of all existing coal production\u201d. It wanted developed countries to take immediate steps to stop subsidies to fossil fuels and to support climate finance and technology transfer for vulnerable nations. It said the climate emergency \u201cposes the single greatest threat to the human rights and security of present and future generations of Pacific Island peoples\u201d. The development forum came two weeks before the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, attends the separate Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu. Australia is yet to respond to a request from the United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, asking countries to outline plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 ahead of a climate action summit in New York in September. Frank Bainimarama, Fiji\u2019s prime minister and chair of the development forum, called on all developed countries \u2013 but especially what he called \u201cour larger neighbours in the Pacific\u201d \u2013 to hear the call ahead of the Tuvalu meeting and make their Paris commitments more ambitious. \u201cWe cannot allow climate commitments to be watered down in the meeting hosted by the nation whose very existence is threatened by the rising waters lapping at its shores,\u201d he said. Richie Merzian, from the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, said the call by Pacific leaders for carry-over credits to be cancelled was unprecedented. \u201cThe Nadi Bay declaration is an unadulterated and powerful message to Australia and other major economies that, ahead of the UN climate summit in September, they need to lift their game on climate action,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos says he will use the opportunity of a looming federal executive meeting to argue for expediting the review into Liberal party culture requested in response to allegations of bullying that surfaced during last year\u2019s leadership move against Malcolm Turnbull. Responding on Wednesday to reports that two alleged sexual assault cases involving Liberal party staff were swept under the carpet internally, Sinodinos said \u201cwe can\u2019t have a situation where people feel the only option is to go public in this way\u201d. He said he was aware that some colleagues had argued the women should have gone straight to the police, but he said victims were often reluctant to take that route because they were concerned about adverse consequences. \u201cThere is a review under way at the moment about what happened last year in terms of the allegations about the culture in some parts of the Liberal party because of the bullying around the time of leadership tensions, but that hasn\u2019t come to fruition yet,\u201d Sinodinos said. He said he would talk to colleagues on the margins of the federal executive meeting \u201cabout how we expedite the review\u201d. \u201cThe review was commissioned after the matters of August last year, so it has been going on a while now and I can understand that we\u2019ve had state elections, federal elections getting in the way \u2013 but the reality is that this is a priority and should be treated as a priority and finalised as a priority\u201d. The Liberal senator said the primary concern had to be for the victims, not the institution. \u201cLet\u2019s look after the victims first\u201d. There are mounting calls for the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to address the Liberal party\u2019s problems with women. Two young women who worked for senior Liberal politicians in federal and New South Wales politics have criticised the party\u2019s handling of their complaints. Chelsey Potter told the Sydney Morning Herald during an incident in 2015 a political staffer had pinned her down and ripped off her underpants. She said she raised the incident with a senior colleague and months later the same person asked if she\u2019d make a fuss if the man received preselection to run for parliament. Dhanya Mani, who worked in NSW state politics, told the paper a political staffer had forced himself on her in 2015 and at one point was choking her. The pair have started a support network to help other victims. The Liberal elder Kathryn Greiner believes the party has a cultural problem. \u201cIf we want to bring transformative and conclusive change into the Liberal party, which we clearly need to do, then it starts with the PM,\u201d she told ABC radio. \u201cSaying to women go to the police is simply another way of shutting people up. It\u2019s not good enough.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Greiner said legal restrictions around public discussion of police investigations made that avenue \u201canother way of pushing it under the carpet\u201d. She called on Morrison and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to take responsibility to make cultural and systemic change. She said they should get some advice from the former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick and retired army chief David Morrison. Greiner said it\u2019s time for the party to introduce quotas. \u201cI see time and time again women being squeezed out of opportunities, simply because they are women. And often times less-calibre individuals are in their place,\u201d she said. Sinodinos said he wasn\u2019t prepared to argue the Liberal party had a cultural problem, but he said action was required. \u201cClearly these women have had bad experiences, we should just face up to that and say, how do we deal with this?\u201d The federal employment minister, Michaelia Cash, has denied her party has a problem with women. \u201cThese are serious allegations and I would say to the parties concerned that they should be referred to the appropriate authorities,\u201d Cash told reporters in Canberra. The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said the women should contact police. \u201cThat sort of behaviour doesn\u2019t belong in any workplace, it\u2019s completely unacceptable, nobody condones that,\u201d he said. The Liberal party is awaiting a final report into its culture commissioned following allegations of bullying of female MPs during last year\u2019s leadership spill.

Pavel Florin, a professional bodyguard by day and player-president of Romania\u2019s Cluj Cricket Club in his spare time, became an overnight sensation after a video of him bowling against French club Dreux in the European Cricket League on Tuesday went viral. Some initial reaction to his distinctive action \u2013 and the pace and accuracy of his deliveries \u2013 was labelled as \u201csnobbish\u201d and damaging to the development of the game in emerging cricket nations. Florin told the European Cricket League: \u201cMaybe someone says my bowling is not beautiful or not effective, but I don\u2019t care, because I love cricket. \u201cIt\u2019s not beautiful, I know, everybody says it, but I\u2019m a slow bowler.\u201d The 40-year-old allrounder, who took up playing cricket at the age of 32, said in an interview in May he had a top score of 36 for his club and once took two wickets in a three-over spell.

      "bodyText": "The casino group Crown Resorts has told the stock exchange it has no extra information to explain a 7.7% drop in its share price on Monday and Tuesday that was sparked by allegations of criminal links made by Nine and in parliament by the independent MP Andrew Wilkie. On Tuesday the ASX asked Crown to respond to articles in Nine newspapers and on its flagship TV current affairs show 60 Minutes, and to tell the market if its earnings would be affected. Crown shares slumped from a closing price of $12.67 on Friday afternoon to a low of $11.69 on Tuesday as Wilkie used parliamentary privilege to detail new allegations of drug use, violence against women, and failure by home affairs officials to check at the border casino high-rollers who fly in by private plane. CommSec data shows the share price was set to fall again, by 1.9%, according to orders queued before the market opened on Wednesday. In a response sent on Wednesday morning before the market opened, Crown\u2019s general counsel, Mary Manos, said the company was \u201cnot aware of any information concerning it that has not been announced to the ASX\u201d which could explain the fall. Manos said it had \u201ctaken into account the matters raised in media reports over recent days which make various allegations regarding CWN\u2019s business dealings and also that the federal government has referred certain aspects of the allegations to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity\u201d. She said Crown had also taken into its knowledge of its earnings for the financial year ending 30 June but \u201chas not yet finalised its full year results\u201d.",
