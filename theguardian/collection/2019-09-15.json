Local authorities have spent a record \u00a3775m buying shopping centres over the past three years, and are expected to outlay a further \u00a3230m next year according to research from retail property body Revo and property advisory firm Lambert Smith Hampton (LSH). Steve Norris, head of planning, development and regeneration at LSH, said investment had surged since 2016 and the current levels could be just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d. \u201cA lot of shopping centres are being bought for regeneration,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might be failing assets in town centres where shop vacancies are high. Councils are going in to revitalise those sites, bringing in residential above or repurposing vacant units with something other than retail.\u201d One in five shopping centres that have changed hands since 2016 have been acquired by local authorities that have ramped up investment as private sector spending has dived by \u00a31.85bn. Financial investors have fled as more than 16 shops a day close their doors, squeezed out by the rise of online shopping and increased costs from business rates, wages and the fall in the value of the pound. But low-cost funding available from the public works loan board has allowed councils to bid higher sums for property and enjoy better returns on investment than private funds. There are concerns that councils are \u201cdumb money\u201d \u2013 paying over the odds for failing businesses. Shropshire council, for example, has been criticised for spending \u00a351m on three shopping centres in Shrewsbury in 2018, all of which have since fallen in value. But cash-strapped councils are not only motivated by generating income to replace money cut by central government, they also gain benefit from supporting communities and attracting new businesses and residents by redeveloping moribund retail schemes. Shropshire council has argued, for example, that the short-term fall in value of its investment in the Darwin, Pride Hill and Riverside shopping centres is not a major concern. It gains annual income of \u00a32.7m from the centres and is hoping to improve the attractiveness of the town by redeveloping at least one of the shopping centres with cinema screens, restaurants and a gym. Norris said council buyouts could be a \u201ccatalyst for change\u201d but only where they were \u201cunderpinned by robust and fully costed business plans and investment strategies\u201d. Successful schemes include Altrincham, where Trafford council invested in the town\u2019s listed market hall, which was then revitalised as a fashionable dining space in partnership with a private investor, and Ashford, where the council has transformed the local Park Mall. Woking borough council has helped to revive its town centre by acquiring the tatty Wolsey Place in 2010 and integrating it more closely with another nearby shopping centre and the high street. Norris said redevelopment could take several years to complete and it was too early to judge the success of many schemes. \u201cOnly a few local authorities have actually stepped into the market. But a number I speak to are in the process of developing strategies and looking at purchasing assets now,\u201d he said.",

According to analysis from the thinktank Resolution Foundation, workers across the country are being failed by employers abusing their rights, amid a steady rise in precarious working conditions over the past decade. The report comes against a backdrop of rising use of zero-hours contracts and temporary and agency employment in the years since the 2008 financial crisis. Workers in the gig economy are also not guaranteed employment rights such as sick and holiday pay, leading to disputes about their employment status. It also comes after Jeremy Corbyn announced plans last week for the creation of a ministry of employment and a workers\u2019 protection agency to enforce employment rights granted under law, should Labour be elected to power. The government has taken steps in recent years to increase the resources and power of bodies such as HMRC and the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Agency, which acts to protect workers from exploitation. However, Britain relies largely on individuals to hold non-compliant firms to account, with more than 100,000 applications made to the employment tribunal system last year alone. Showing the scale of labour market law violations across the country, the Resolution Foundation said that as many as one in 20 workers did not receive any holiday pay despite being legally entitled to at least 28 days a year. There are more than 32 million people in the UK workforce, the highest level on record. Discounting those who are self-employed and do not get automatic legal protections for holiday and sick pay, the research suggests that at least a million people across the country are being denied their rights in one way or another. According to the research, almost one in 10 workers do not receive a legally required payslip, making it hard for them to calculate whether they are receiving the right level of pay, pension and holiday and to check for any deductions. Tax officials at HMRC have also identified a record 200,000 cases of workers not receiving the minimum wage as a result of enforcement work last year. The legal minimum is \u00a38.21 an hour for workers over the age of 25.

Such algorithms, used to mine insights from data collected by police, are currently deployed for various purposes including facial recognition, mobile phone data extraction, social media analysis, predictive crime mapping and individual risk assessment. Researchers at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), commissioned by the government\u2019s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, focused on predictive crime mapping and individual risk assessment and found algorithms that are trained on police data may replicate \u2013 and in some cases amplify \u2013 the existing biases inherent in the data set, such as over- or under-policing of certain communities. \u201cThe effects of a biased sample could be amplified by algorithmic predictions via a feedback loop, whereby future policing is predicted, not future crime,\u201d the authors said. The paper reveals that police officers, who were interviewed for the research, are concerned about the lack of safeguards and oversight regarding the use of predictive policing. One officer told the researchers that \u201cyoung black men are more likely to be stop and searched than young white men, and that\u2019s purely down to human bias. That human bias is then introduced into the data sets, and bias is then generated in the outcomes of the application of those data sets.\u201d Another officer said police forces \u201cpile loads of resources into a certain area and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, purely because there\u2019s more policing going into that area, not necessarily because of discrimination on the part of officers\u201d. The technological landscape was described by one officer as a \u201cpatchwork quilt, uncoordinated and delivered to different standards in different settings and for different outcomes\u201d. The briefing paper identifies individuals from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds who are \u201ccalculated as posing a greater risk\u201d of criminal behaviour by algorithms. This bias exists because individuals from this group are more likely to have frequent contact with public services and, in doing so, generate higher levels of data, which the police often have access to, the paper reveals. The implications are serious both in terms of police allocation of resources, which may be ineffective as they are based on incorrect calculations, and legally where \u201cdiscrimination claims could be brought by individuals scored \u2018negatively\u2019 in comparison to others of different ages or genders\u201d, the paper adds. The briefing paper also highlights the risk of \u201cautomation bias\u201d, whereby police officers become overreliant on the use of analytical tools, undermining their discretion and causing them to disregard other relevant factors. The paper, Data Analytics and Algorithmic Bias in Policing, by Alexander Babuta and Marion Oswald, summarises the interim findings of an ongoing independent study into the use of data analytics for policing within England and Wales and explores different types of bias that can arise.",

      "bodyText": "Brexit uncertainty and a global economic slowdown amid the US-China trade war has set Britain on course for the most prolonged slump in business investment in 17 years, according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). Setting Britain on course for weaker economic growth in future, the lobby group said business spending in the UK was due to decline by 1.5% in 2019 and by 0.1% next year as companies put their investment plans on ice amid the global political turmoil. Paving the way for the longest period of annual declines in business investment since the turn of the millennium \u2013 when the dotcom bubble burst to drag down investment around the world \u2013 the BCC said investment in the UK was due to fall for three years in a row. The length of the downturn was already poised to exceed the slump after the 2008 financial crisis, when business investment fell by a greater degree but only for two years. The business lobby group warned that relentless Brexit uncertainty was preventing firms from investing and diverting resources into no-deal planning. Those funds might have otherwise been spent on improving economic productivity or developing new products in the UK. Separately, the Institute of Directors (IoD) has called on the UK and EU to compromise to chart a way forward on Brexit while urging both to improve no-deal planning efforts. The institute has published survey about the \u201cimpossible situation\u201d facing business leaders. A clear majority of IoD members have repeatedly expressed concern that a disorderly Brexit would damage their organisations. Faced with choosing between this and a further article 50 extension, respondents to a summer poll of 950 business leaders were slightly more considered, however. A slim overall majority (51%) said no deal would be more negative for their organisation, though this was significantly above the 32% who believed further delay could have a worse impact. With no deal still a possibility, the IoD is calling for targeted financial assistance to help small firms\u2019 Brexit preparations. Its analysis underlined that directors of smaller organisations were less likely to feel fully prepared than their larger counterparts. The political turmoil in Britain comes as global economic growth slows as Donald Trump levies import tariffs on Chinese goods shipped to the US. This has sent world trade volumes tumbling and affect manufacturing output. The rise of protectionism has had an impact in Britain, where the situation has been exacerbated by Brexit. Despite mounting risks to the economy posed by Brexit, the BCC continued to forecast the UK would reach a deal with the EU that would include a smooth transition to a new trading relationship. However, the scale of the disruption for businesses meant economic growth in 2019 and 2020 is on track to be the lowest since the financial crisis. Downgrading its forecasts for the British economy, even if a deal can be struck, the lobby group said GDP would expand by 1.2% this year. This is down from a previous forecast of 1.3%, and by 0.8% in 2020, down from an expectation of 1% growth. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the BCC, said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the economic costs of the ongoing Brexit stalemate alongside that backdrop of weaker global economic conditions. Businesses have had to switch plans and enact their no-deal planning \u2013 that\u2019s going to have a hangover effect into next year. \u201cGiven the current low growth trajectory, if you had a significant shock for the economy on top of that, that dramatically increases the probability of a recession.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWages have now grown faster than inflation for 12 consecutive months, our employment rate is at a record high and the UK\u2019s lowest paid workers saw their wages rise at the fastest rate in 20 years thanks to the introduction of the \u2018national living wage\u2019. \u201cAs we prepare for the UK to leave the EU on 31 October, our number one priority is ensuring businesses have the help and certainty they need to invest and grow their productivity by taking advantage of the opportunities beyond.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "European officials have reacted with exasperation after Boris Johnson compared himself to the Incredible Hulk throwing off the shackles of the EU the day before he was due to travel to Luxembourg for talks in pursuit of a Brexit deal. No 10 struck a combative tone before the scheduled meeting with European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, saying the prime minister would tell him that the UK must reject any new Brexit deadline. A Downing Street source said that Johnson would \u201cstress to Mr Juncker that, while he wants to secure a deal, if no deal can be agreed by 18 October his policy is to leave without a deal on 31 October \u2013 and reject any delay offered by the EU\u201d. In turn, Juncker was expected to ask Johnson to spell out his ideas for replacing the Irish backstop, the key issue in any new Brexit deal. The robust No 10 line came amid renewed speculation that Johnson could be considering ways to get around the backbench rebel law mandating a Brexit extension in case of a no-deal by potentially seeking loopholes in the legislation, or suspending parliament again, with reports saying his chief aide, Dominic Cummings, had raised the latter idea. However, it is understood Downing Street will not make any decisions before an expected supreme court ruling later this week on legal challenges to the decision to suspend parliament for five weeks. The lunch meeting with Juncker comes 26 days after Johnson met Angela Merkel in Berlin and declared he had 30 days to persuade the EU there was a viable alternative to the backstop, but as yet nothing has emerged. Johnson insisted \u201ca huge amount of progress\u201d was being made, a view dismissed in Brussels.

This will need to continue. He may also have to take measures to make sure his best players are less subject to rotation. Kevin De Bruyne, whose form had been league-leading prior to the international break, was left on the bench after playing two matches for Belgium but it was only after his introduction on the hour that City upped their tempo.</p> <p>Being part of one of the world\u2019s richest and most successful clubs has its upsides, but also its unique challenges. And not every one can be solved by opening the chequebook. After retaining the title so impressively last season there is a mental challenge involved in going again and Guardiola says the team struggled equally against Bournemouth as they did against Norwich, not to mention the points dropped against Spurs. Guardiola is right to suggest that the answers must come from within. Perhaps a wake-up call in September is no bad thing.</p>",

This will need to continue. He may also have to take measures to make sure his best players are less subject to rotation. Kevin De Bruyne, whose form had been league-leading prior to the international break, was left on the bench after playing two matches for Belgium but it was only after his introduction on the hour that City upped their tempo. Being part of one of the world\u2019s richest and most successful clubs has its upsides, but also its unique challenges. And not every one can be solved by opening the chequebook. After retaining the title so impressively last season there is a mental challenge involved in going again and Guardiola says the team struggled equally against Bournemouth as they did against Norwich, not to mention the points dropped against Spurs. Guardiola is right to suggest that the answers must come from within. Perhaps a wake-up call in September is no bad thing.",

      "bodyText": "Labour will face increased pressure from local party activists to adopt a more wholehearted anti-Brexit stance at its upcoming conference, according to an analysis of submitted motions which shows 90% want the party to openly back remain in any future referendum. The scrutiny of the 90 motions connected to Brexit tabled by local parties ahead of the conference in Brighton, which will begin on Saturday 21 September, showed 81 of them called for Labour to explicitly support remain, while there were none opposing a second referendum which included a remain option. The group Another Europe is Possible, which carried out the study and which campaigns for remain from a leftwing perspective, said the results showed the Labour leadership should listen to the views of party members on Brexit. Labour is currently committed to going into a general election pushing for a new referendum, which would include a \u201ccredible\u201d leave option \u2013 possibly a deal negotiated by Labour \u2013 and an option to stay in the EU. However, there has been no decision as to what side Labour would back in a referendum, with some tension between more remain-minded elements of the parliamentary party and the more cautious approach of Jeremy Corbyn and his allies. Last week the party\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, used a speech to argue that Labour should \u201cunambiguously and unequivocally back remain\u201d, and also seek a second Brexit referendum before a general election. The idea was swiftly rejected by Corbyn, who called it \u201cTom\u2019s view\u201d. Remain-minded campaigners are set to push the issue at the conference. A majority of the Brexit motions submitted have been put forward either by Another Europe is Possible or two other groups, Labour for a Socialist Europe and Open Labour. Michael Chessum from Another Europe is Possible said: \u201cLabour members are the secret weapon of the party at a general election, and the party ignores them at its peril. \u201cSupport for an explicit remain stance is evidently overwhelming. If backroom manoeuvres are deployed to stop this being debated on conference floor it will be a disaster for morale and for Labour\u2019s prospects. \u201cWe need a debate and a vote at conference. Only if Labour can get clarity on this part of its policy can it fight the election on its domestic agenda.\u201d Polling has indicated that the mass Labour membership is notably more remain-minded than the party\u2019s official policy, with one survey from January saying 72% sought a second referendum, and 88% saying they would back remain if one was held.",

      "bodyText": "The England captain, Owen Farrell, has had to change his tackling technique amid fears of a flurry of red and yellow cards at the World Cup. Farrell was involved in two high-profile incidents where no-arms tackles went unpunished last autumn but directives from World Rugby issued at the end of last season state he should have been punished. Eddie Jones has already warned how the World Cup could be \u201cdestroyed\u201d by inconsistent refereeing of the tackle area but England\u2019s defence coach, John Mitchell, revealed on Sunday that Farrell has taken measures in training to alter his approach, with the squad on high alert over red and yellow cards. When World Rugby issued its directives Farrell\u2019s shoulder charge on South Africa\u2019s Andre Esterhuizen was used as an example in an accompanying video to demonstrate when a yellow card should be awarded. Farrell was not sanctioned during the match by the referee, Angus Gardner, denying South Africa the chance to kick a penalty at goal with the clock red and condemning them to a 12-11 defeat. Three weeks later Farrell\u2019s no\u2011arms tackle on Izack Rodda also went unpunished in England\u2019s victory against Australia with the Wallabies furious they were not awarded a penalty try. At the time England played down concerns overs Farrell\u2019s technique but in light of World Rugby\u2019s edict, which led to four red and 13 yellow cards at the Junior World Cup this summer, Farrell has been working specifically with England\u2019s strength and conditioning coach, John Carrington, who also acts as Mitchell\u2019s assistant in defence. \u201c[Owen\u2019s] not overly focused in that area but he has made some adjustments,\u201d said Mitchell, who has attended a meeting with World Rugby\u2019s head of referees, Alain Rolland, to discuss high tackles. \u201cJohn Carrington is very good at the tackle technique, so they\u2019ve just made some adjustments based on that. If your hand is in front of your shoulder then you\u2019ve got a better chance of making a proper wrap tackle. If your shoulder is ahead of your hands then the law probably doesn\u2019t look after you very well. At the back of everyone\u2019s mind there were a lot of cards issued at the U20s world tournament.

      "bodyText": "New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, on Sunday announced an \u201cemergency executive action\u201d to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarette products, amid a surge in both youth vaping and concern over its health effects. \u201cManufacturers of fruit and candy-flavored e-cigarettes are intentionally and recklessly targeting young people, and today we\u2019re taking action to put an end to it,\u201d said Cuomo. The governor said New York\u2019s top health official would convene an emergency meeting with the state\u2019s public health council this week, to ban the products. \u201cNames like, \u2018Bubblegum\u2019, \u2018Cotton Candy\u2019, \u2018Captain Crunch\u2019,\u201d Cuomo said, \u201cthese are obviously targeted to young people and highly effective at targeting young people.\u201d Tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarette products would not be banned, Cuomo said. He also said authorities would target stores selling such products to underage persons, warning: \u201cThose retailers are now on notice that we are ramping up enforcement and they will be caught and prosecuted.\u201d In Washington, Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that his administration will propose a federal ban on thousands of e-cigarette flavors. \u201cPeople are going to watch what we\u2019re saying and parents are going to be a lot tougher with respect to their children,\u201d Trump said. In December last year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said more than 37% of high school seniors reported \u201cany vaping\u201d over the past 12 months, a number that was just under 28% in 2017. \u201cMore than one in 10 eighth graders (10.9%) say they vaped nicotine in the past year and use is up significantly in virtually all vaping measures among eighth, 10th and 12th graders,\u201d NIH said. At least six confirmed deaths have been connected to vaping across the US \u2013 in addition to more than 450 cases of reported lung issues. Repeatedly calling vaping \u201cdangerous\u201d, Cuomo said: \u201cIt is addicting young people to nicotine at a very early age and nicotine is highly addictive. It doesn\u2019t even matter what product you are using. It is getting young people addicted to nicotine.\u201d He said that while vaping was \u201ctechnically\u201d better than smoking, \u201cthe only situation, in my mind, factually, that justifies vaping is if you had a person that said, \u2018I currently smoke, and I have tried every other device to stop smoking. I\u2019ve tried everything. Nothing has worked, except vaping.\u2019\u201d Cuomo said that there had been a debate about whether menthol-flavored e-cigarettes should be banned, and that he and the state health commissioner, Dr Howard Zucker, had discussed the issue. \u201cDr Zucker feels at this point he is not yet ready to ban menthol,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? There is some data that suggests for menthol cigarette smokers, again who have tried every other device to stop smoking \u2026 the menthol flavor for the vaping helps menthol cigarette smokers.\u201d In order for the ban to be implemented, Zucker would make a recommendation to the public health council. If it agrees, there would be a two-week grace period before authorities began stepped up enforcement of retailers. Juul, the largest company in the e-cigarette market, said it was reviewing Cuomo\u2019s announcement \u2013 and agreed there was a need for \u201caggressive category-wide action\u201d. In a statement, a spokesman said the company would \u201cfully comply\u201d with local laws and federal policy. Juul says it stopped selling flavored products in traditional retail stores in November 2018.",

      "bodyText": "Joe Root claimed to have found the blueprint for his Test side and hailed the summer as a success after England followed up the World Cup triumph in July by denying Australia an outright Ashes win. A 135-run victory by England at the Oval ensured a 2-2 scoreline and the first drawn series between the two sides since 1972. It made the ticker\u2011tape celebrations for Tim Paine\u2019s tourists at the end more palatable for the exhausted hosts. Australia may have retained the urn at Old Trafford but Root, who once again restated his desire to remain as captain and lead the next tour to Australia in two years\u2019 time, is encouraged by the response as the national team\u2019s focus now returns to Test cricket. Root said: \u201cThe scoreline looks a hell of a lot better than 3-1 and is probably a fair result. It has been a long, gruelling summer. For English cricket it is a success. There has been some phenomenal cricket. The World Cup was incredible and to be backed up by such an evenly matched Ashes \u2013 what a summer of cricket it has been. \u201c[This win] is a blueprint of how we want to go about playing. We can get better and there are areas we want to strengthen and improve on but guys have stepped up under pressure and that is really pleasing. Hopefully that is a starting point. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re starting to get to grips with Test cricket after a long period of one-day cricket. In the next two and a half years we have to really push and prepare for that tour of Australia. That will be a huge focus for me and for English cricket.\u201d Matthew Wade had frustrated England on the fourth day with 117 from 166 balls as Australia chased a fanciful 399 to win, emerging unscathed from a gripping eight-over duel with a fired\u2011up Jofra Archer after tea that saw the fast bowler hit 95.6mph. But when Root had the left-hander stumped just after 6pm, and then held catches from Nathan Lyon and Josh Hazlewood off consecutive balls in the following over from Jack Leach, Australia were all out for 263 and denied a first series win in England since 2001. Archer was named player of the match after his second six-wicket haul in the first innings and, following 22 victims in his first four Tests, the 24-year-old represents one of the reasons Root is optimistic about the future. \u201cWhen I first faced him in nets with a red ball, it was clear he was going to be very special,\u201d Root said. \u201cWe have got to be careful about expecting too much though.

The right-hander made 774 runs in just seven innings \u2013 his first Test outing after a 12-month suspension \u2013 and some 333 more than the next best batsman in England\u2019s Ben Stokes. Stokes, hero of the World Cup final in July and then miracle man in Leeds with the unbeaten 135 that chased down a record 359 on the final day, said: \u201cI\u2019ll look back on Headingley in a few years\u2019 time with fond memories probably but I\u2019d swap it for winning for the Ashes still.\u201d As well as some standout work from Rory Burns at the top of the order, Stuart Broad stepped up in the absence of the injured Jimmy Anderson with 23 wickets and gave David Warner a personal nightmare along the way.

The interest lies not in the detail of who stabbed whose back or which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/david-cameron-slammed-for-horrendous-mistake-brexit-referendum\" title=\"\">lies</a> Boris Johnson told and when. By releasing only extracts, Mr Cameron is able to control the narrative for a few days. The full verdict must wait until the whole book is out. But a broad outline already seems clear.</p> <p>Mr Cameron is upper-class \u2013 a distant relation of the Queen. Yet he won two elections in a country which was supposed to be a \u201cclassless society\u201d. His father was a stockbroker who sent his clever son to Eton. From there, he went to Oxford where Mr Cameron was a member of a posh dining club. He was also smart, gaining a first-class degree. His poshness never held him back in politics, neither did the Notting Hill set he cultivated. Mr Cameron\u2019s right-hand man was George Osborne, the son of a baronet. At a time of austerity and economic gloom, it might have been considered dangerous to look out of touch. His political skill was to translate his personal brand into a guarantee that his was a new, moderate Tory party.</p> <p>No one should be blamed for their parents or their luck. By the standards of everyday life he seems an unremarkably decent man; by the standards of some of his colleagues, a kind and thoughtful one. But politicians should not be judged by the standards of everyday life. They should be held to higher ones, because it is in their power to make much more damaging mistakes than most people can.</p> <p>Mr Cameron was quite without the imagination or the moral seriousness to see the suffering that his government caused by its austerity policies; he was a man who could not really believe that food banks were needed even in his own prosperous constituency of Witney as a result of his deliberate actions. And just as he could not register the pain and anger of the financially dispossessed who had been robbed of their futures, he could not feel the rage of those who\u2019d been robbed of their pasts: the emotionally dispossessed whose vision of England could not be accommodated in his bland, technocratic, comfortable new world. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1514830/Off-the-cuff-Cameron-accuses-Ukip-of-being-fruitcakes-and-closet-racists.html\" title=\"\">Closet racists, fruitcakes</a>\u201d, he called them. However true this judgment appears now that they have climbed out of the closet, it betrayed an extraordinary lack of understanding of elements of his own party.</p> <p>His whole life was spent among people for whom mistakes would not ultimately matter. Yet political passion is strongest in people who know that they can\u2019t afford mistakes and can scarcely afford bad luck. There is something very broken about a system which allowed him to rise to the top without ever understanding why most of the other players were in the game. Until the end of his career his niceness never cost him anything, but his inability to see that others \u2013 particularly those he knew well \u2013 did not think or act as he did has cost his country very dearly.</p> <ul> <li><p>This editorial was amended on 15 September 2019.

His poshness never held him back in politics, neither did the Notting Hill set he cultivated. Mr Cameron\u2019s right-hand man was George Osborne, the son of a baronet. At a time of austerity and economic gloom, it might have been considered dangerous to look out of touch. His political skill was to translate his personal brand into a guarantee that his was a new, moderate Tory party. No one should be blamed for their parents or their luck. By the standards of everyday life he seems an unremarkably decent man; by the standards of some of his colleagues, a kind and thoughtful one. But politicians should not be judged by the standards of everyday life. They should be held to higher ones, because it is in their power to make much more damaging mistakes than most people can. Mr Cameron was quite without the imagination or the moral seriousness to see the suffering that his government caused by its austerity policies; he was a man who could not really believe that food banks were needed even in his own prosperous constituency of Witney as a result of his deliberate actions. And just as he could not register the pain and anger of the financially dispossessed who had been robbed of their futures, he could not feel the rage of those who\u2019d been robbed of their pasts: the emotionally dispossessed whose vision of England could not be accommodated in his bland, technocratic, comfortable new world. \u201cCloset racists, fruitcakes\u201d, he called them. However true this judgment appears now that they have climbed out of the closet, it betrayed an extraordinary lack of understanding of elements of his own party. His whole life was spent among people for whom mistakes would not ultimately matter. Yet political passion is strongest in people who know that they can\u2019t afford mistakes and can scarcely afford bad luck. There is something very broken about a system which allowed him to rise to the top without ever understanding why most of the other players were in the game. Until the end of his career his niceness never cost him anything, but his inability to see that others \u2013 particularly those he knew well \u2013 did not think or act as he did has cost his country very dearly.

That remains highly unlikely: close ties between Republican leaders and the gun rights lobby have led to legislative stasis on gun control despite numerous mass shootings across America. Pelosi and Schumer said in a statement they spoke to Trump on Sunday. \u201cWe made it clear,\u201d they said, \u201cthat any proposal he endorses that does not include the House-passed universal background checks legislation will not get the job done, as dangerous loopholes will still exist and people who shouldn\u2019t have guns will still have access.\u201d The House passed gun control legislation in February. The Senate has not taken it up. In a statement, the White House said \u201cthe conversation was cordial\u201d but added that \u201cthe president made no commitments\u201d on the House bill. Elsewhere, Beto O\u2019Rourke continued to beat a louder drum. The former Texas congressman and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination has insisted he will lead a government buyback of assault-style weapons if he wins the White House. That remains an outside prospect at best but O\u2019Rourke\u2019s passionate rhetoric \u2013 and frequent resort to forceful obscenity \u2013 has struck a note on the campaign trail. On Sunday he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press criticism of his tactics \u201cjust shows you how screwed up the priorities in Washington DC are\u201d. In early August, in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s home town, El Paso, a gunman killed 22 people at a Walmart. Less than a day later, nine people were killed in Dayton, Ohio. On 31 August, seven people were killed in Odessa, Texas. \u201cI think what\u2019s truly awful is a 17-month-old baby shot in the face with an AR-15, as happened in Odessa,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWhat\u2019s truly awful is 22 people killed in a Walmart the Saturday before school starts that next Monday, buying their school supplies, innocent of any crime or any threat to this country, in fact, living in one of the safest cities in America, El Paso, Texas, hunted down by their ethnicity with a weapon that was designed for use on a battlefield.\u201d He continued: \u201cI refuse to even acknowledge the politics or the polling or the fear or the NRA, that has purchased the complicity and silence of members of Congress. And this weak response to a real tragedy in America, 40,000 gun deaths a year, we\u2019ve got to do something about it. And I\u2019m proposing that we do something about it.\u201d A buyback, he said, would not violate the second amendment and the right to bear arms, as it would be \u201csomething that we\u2019re able to do through the commerce clause \u2026 this is constitutionally sound\u201d. He went on, in familiar fashion, to cite support from Republican AR-15 owners he said he had spoken to out on the campaign trail. \u201cI think there\u2019s support beyond the Democratic party,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cto include Republicans and independents, gun owners and non-gun owners alike, to do the right thing\u201d. There is not uniform support within the Democratic party. On CNN\u2019s State of the Union, presidential contender Pete Buttigieg was asked if O\u2019Rourke was playing into the hands of the NRA. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, adding that polling showed the US public wants universal background checks on gun sales, red flag laws designed to take guns from individuals deemed unfit to have them, and bans on the sale of high-capacity magazines and the sale of new assault weapons. \u201cThis is a golden moment to finally do something,\u201d the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, insisted, \u201cbecause we have been arguing about this for as long as I have been alive. When even this president and even Mitch McConnell are at least pretending to be open to reforms, we know that we have a moment on our hands. Let\u2019s make the most of it and get these things done.\u201d Whether McConnell will really back legislative action is, of course, a doleful question indeed. On Sunday the Kentucky senator Rand Paul indicated the strength of the Republican roadblock. \u201cI think that part of the problem,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cis cultural and losing a sense of right and wrong.\u201d He went on to say he advocated action, but with a focus on mental health. \u201cI think we should look at each of these killings and say, what went wrong? And I think the consistent theme here is, typically, not always, but white teenage boys in their middle teenage years to early 20s \u2026 almost every one of them is sending off signals.\u201d Asked if he would support a \u201cred flag law\u201d or background checks, Paul said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet what\u2019s coming forward. I can tell you that it\u2019ll have to be consistent with the constitution.\u201d He added: \u201cThere has to be due process. You have to be allowed a lawyer, because the danger is, they could just say, \u2018Oh, anybody that takes antidepressants can\u2019t have a gun, or anybody who\u2019s ever been to a psychiatrist can\u2019t have a gun.\u2019 And so there is a danger of going too far, where we pre-emptively just are out there taking everyone\u2019s guns. \u201cAnd I am alarmed and it does alarm a lot of us when we hear Beto O\u2019Rourke up saying, yes, they\u2019re just going to come and knock the door down and take our guns. \u201cThat scares the heck out of a lot of Republicans and a lot of gun owners.\u201d",

From a starting position of 8-8, common consensus was that the greater strength in depth of Inkster\u2019s side would prevail. Instead, Catriona Matthew \u2013 so unheralded in British sporting context \u2013 presided over a victory that reverberated way beyond Perthshire.</p> <p>\u201cI always had faith in Suzann,\u201d said Matthew. \u201cIt was just unbelievable.

At that juncture, a tie \u2013 or US victory \u2013 looked inevitable. Brittany Altomare thumped Jodi Ewart Shadoff 5&amp;4 and both Korda sisters, Nelly and Jessica, added to the US tally.

Thankfully, alas, it barely mattered.</p> <p>Carlota Ciganda had fuelled hopes of an unlikely European win with a 1up success over Danielle Kang in game one. Georgia Hall, outstanding once again in the Solheim Cup, ensured four wins from as many games as Lexi Thompson was seen off 2&amp;1. In Thompson\u2019s defence, she had been battling a back problem which had placed her singles appearance in doubt.</p> <p>Anna Nordqvist, out of sorts over the first two days, recovered brilliantly to see off Morgan Pressel 4&amp;3. C\u00e9line Boutier, like Pettersen a Matthew wildcard pick, was a 2&amp;1 victor over Annie Park.</p> <p>Such details are, of course, intrinsically linked to the outcome.

From a starting position of 8-8, common consensus was that the greater strength in depth of Inkster\u2019s side would prevail. Instead, Catriona Matthew \u2013 so unheralded in British sporting context \u2013 presided over a victory that reverberated way beyond Perthshire. \u201cI always had faith in Suzann,\u201d said Matthew. \u201cIt was just unbelievable. There has never been a better moment.\u201d If focus understandably centred on Pettersen, the heroics of Bronte Law also require appreciation. The Englishwoman won three of her last four holes against Ally McDonald to seal a 2&amp;1 victory. This meant Pettersen\u2019s match mattered. Law had been one down after 10. At that juncture, a tie \u2013 or US victory \u2013 looked inevitable. Brittany Altomare thumped Jodi Ewart Shadoff 5&amp;4 and both Korda sisters, Nelly and Jessica, added to the US tally. As Angel Yin defeated Azahara Mu\u00f1oz and Lizette Salas took down Anne van Dam by a hole, the European outlook was grim. With the outcome still in the balance, Charley Hull made an awful mess of the 18th when 1up on Megan Khang. This marked the second time Hull had let a winning position slip on the last; such margins can, in normal circumstances, determine events such as this. \u201cI feel pretty happy,\u201d said Hull. \u201cI think I was one down with about five or six to play, so to halve the match is not too bad.\u201d This won\u2019t be a candidate for analysis of the year. Thankfully, alas, it barely mattered. Carlota Ciganda had fuelled hopes of an unlikely European win with a 1up success over Danielle Kang in game one. Georgia Hall, outstanding once again in the Solheim Cup, ensured four wins from as many games as Lexi Thompson was seen off 2&amp;1. In Thompson\u2019s defence, she had been battling a back problem which had placed her singles appearance in doubt. Anna Nordqvist, out of sorts over the first two days, recovered brilliantly to see off Morgan Pressel 4&amp;3. C\u00e9line Boutier, like Pettersen a Matthew wildcard pick, was a 2&amp;1 victor over Annie Park. Such details are, of course, intrinsically linked to the outcome. Yet the defining moment dwarfed all before it and, inevitably, so much that will follow. In this age, where so many final acts are lazily classed among the greatest ever, this was a genuine jaw-dropper. Farewell, Suzann; and thanks for the drama.",

I have the equivalent Australian one (second hand). Forty years ago I met an old guy in Richmond called Jack and got to know him quite well. He told me that when he was a young lad he had walked to the MCG when Australia were playing England in the Bodyline Series 1932-33. He waited outside the ground (with many others doing the same) until it was known that Australia were batting, and only then used his precious money to get in so that could see Bradman bat. Australia lost their second wicket at 67, then Bradman got a bottom edge on a pull from Bill Bowes and was out first ball for zero (I think his only Test golden duck). Jack said he spent the rest of the day crying, and all that night - Bradman made a century in the second innings but being the Depression, young Jack could not afford to go to another day\u2019s play.</em></p> <p><em><br>He also told me how a few years before that, the Federal Labor Leader of the Opposition (when Federal Parliament was still in Melbourne before they moved to Canberra in 1927) would come into his parents\u2019 Milk Bar in the morning to buy a small bar of chocolate. The first time it happened Jack must have been only about 5 or 6 years old when he served him, and he said \u201cYes Mr Scullin\u201d, to which Jim Scullin said \u201cJust call me Jim\u201d. He said that Jim Scullin would then get catch the tram to Parliament, engaging passengers in talk about politics or sport on the way.

What? Speak up a bit. It isn\u2019t!? A shared series means Australia retain the Ashes? Oh well...</p> <p>The destination of the urn may have already been determined before battle commenced in south London but England turning in their most complete performance of the series so far is a welcome sight nonetheless for the majority of patrons inside a packed Oval. A strong day in the field on Friday was backed up by some refreshingly competent batting on Saturday to guide the hosts into a commanding position. It would take a Stokesian feat of escapology for Australia to wriggle free of their current predicament.</p> <p>Joe Denly has hogged the morning headlines, and most likely another series at the top of England\u2019s batting order, with his slow-burn series ending in impressive fashion. His obduracy, following on from Sam Curran\u2019s tenacity with the ball, have given England a steelier edge, much to Australia\u2019s dissatisfaction. For the first time during this long old tour of theirs they have looked tetchy, bordering on rattled, and ready for the next Qantas home. </p> <p>Whether they do so as jubilant series winners or content urn retainers will depend on how they occupy the crease over the next couple of days. We know with Steve Smith anything is possible...</p> <p>I\u2019m around for the hour leading up to play, after which it\u2019s over to Geoff Lemon.

Thanks to you all, on behalf of the OBO team, for your good-hearted, funny and knowledgable emails. Sorry I\u2019ve not been able to include many of the flurry of them this afternoon. It\u2019s been a wonderful summer in so many ways, of redemption for Australia, of promise for England. To Steve Smith, the spoils. See some of your in a couple of months, in New Zealand, at the witching hour. Good night! Root on Bayliss, who, baggy sunhat plonked inelegantly on his head, is deliberately talking and not listening. \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant, he\u2019s added a huge amount to this Test team and what he\u2019s done to our white ball cricket is phenomenal. He\u2019s got a great sense of humour and we played for him today.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve had two tilts at the Ashes,\u201d says Athers, \u201cnot many captains get three?\u201d Root is adamant. \u201cI want to be leading this team.\u201d Tim Paine - what a nice guy. Athers prods him for his future \u201cI don\u2019t see this as the end game, I didn\u2019t see the job as an option not so long ago! I\u2019ve got bit of cricket left in this old body but I\u2019m not looking too far ahead\u201d Root and Paine take one arm each of the silver Ashes goblet. They look underwhelmed. Now the real thing! The old urn gets squirted with champagne by the Aussies as a filthy-looking Langer stares blankly out and chews on and on and on. The Oval is still full as the players line up for the presentation ceremony. The chairmen of Cricket Australia and the ECB are handshaking on the dais; Tom Harrison and Trevor Bayliss watch from behind the glass high up in the dressing room. Player of the match: Jofra Archer, just a little something to top an unbelievable summer - the World Cup; the super over; his battle with Steve Smith, the six wickets in the first innings, his eight over stint against Matthew Wade this afternoon. England\u2019s player of the series: Ben Stokes Australia\u2019s player of the series: Steve Smith Compton-Miller medal: For his 774 runs across four matches, at an average of 110, and 12 catches, Steve Smith. And, at last, I can\u2019t hear a single boo. Smith: \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing couple of months, the cricket has been spectacular, I\u2019ve loved every minute and I\u2019m very proud to bring the urn home \u201cI saw Jofra last year in the IPL and I saw straight away he was a raw talent. He\u2019s got a great set of skills and an incredibly bright futures.\u201d \u201cYou always want to get better as a player, nothing is ever too much, I\u2019ll keep working hard for as long as I can.\u201d Take that as a warning! Here\u2019s our snap report of the day: Warney sends out one last last pointed barb: \u201cTim Paine handed them this Test match on a platter.\u201d Nasser: \u201cI\u2019ve got to applaud the players, people talk about England\u2019s World Cup but Australia had to play a World Cup too. The players have had to dig deep and everyone today, that battle between Archer and Wade summed up the series for me, this is still Australia and England. You have to applaud the players for putting in the shift and in such a congested summer. Gower and Botham raise a glass - a chardonnay - in the commentary box . I raise one to you too OBO-ers. In the dressing room, Justin Langer and Tim Paine stare blankly into the distance, Steve Waugh stands to the side. Go and give them a hug Steve. Here\u2019s a quick reminder of the story of an enthralling series Edgbaston :Australia won by 251 runs Lord\u2019s:Match drawn Headingly: England won by one wicket Old Trafford: Australia won by 185 runs The Oval: England won by 135 runs What a finale! The urn is Australia\u2019s, and deservedly, with Smith a Colossus striding above all others, but this match belongs to England. Australia still haven\u2019t won an Ashes series in England since before Sam Curran was at school (2001.) Four wickets for Leach, four for Broad, two for Root and menaces money for Jofra Archer. Fittingly Ian Botham and David Gower are on to commentate for their own last hurrahs. That winning combination again! A diving catch by Root at short midwicket as Hazlewood tries to chip him away. And Jack Leach will be on a hat-trick next time he picks up the ball. Lyon sucker-punched into a sweep low and straight into Joe Root\u2019s hands at square leg, seconds after he moved himself there. And that is nearly that. 76th over: Australia 260-8 (Lyon 0, Siddle 11) A wicket maiden for Root, who has provided the golden bullet in his own armoury. That was quite something by Wade - a counter-attacking, brave, nimble-footed century - whose Ashes has been book-ended by hundreds. The battle with Archer was one for the memory-vault. Wade strides down the pitch, pushes forward and the ball spins past his bat into the gloves of Bairstow, who makes no mistake. The end of cracking innings, and with it, Australia\u2019s chances of that miracle win. 75th over: Australia 260-7 (Wade 117, Siddle 11) You can feel the chill start to descend over The Oval, though the players are still in shirt sleeves. A testing over by Leach, who replaces Broad. 74th over: Australia 258-7 (Wade 116, Siddle 10) Root again, four from the over, tick goes the clock, down comes the target. England still hot favourites, but there would be some balance to the universe if Australia did a Headingley... 73rd over: Australia 254-7 (Wade 113, Siddle 9) Siddle edges Broad through the empty second slip spot down into the stretching shade for four. Then, take that, a quite charming off drive for another boundary. Australian need another 145 \u201cHi Tanya\u201d, writes Geoff Wignall. \u201cI believe I can top your demanding money with menaces group: I\u2019d send Brian Close, or even his ghost.\u201d While Nuggehalli Nigam has spotted a flaw. \u201cI foresee one problem with your crack team: Miandad and Lillee might end up menacing each other.\u201d 72nd over: Australia 244-7 (Wade 113, Siddle 1) Wade starts to open his shoulders. England think they have him caught at slip by Stokes... and so does the umpires but the replay shows the ball just spinning out of the dust. Root is fizzing the ball here! 71st over: Australia 244-7 (Wade 111, Siddle 0) Wade, the gimlet eyed cowboy, chews slowly on his hide, pulling Broad for four but he can\u2019t do a thing about Cummins\u2019 loose waft. Fifty minutes left of the day, three wickets to fall and level the series. Cummins drives away from his feet and audibly edges through to Bairstow who takes the ball down by his feet 70th over: Australia 239-6 (Wade 107, Cummins 9) Calamity! Two missed chances off Wade in one Root over. First, Bairstow misses a tricky stumping that bounces more than he\u2019d expected and he fumbles, missing vital seconds, then Stokes can\u2019t hold onto a ball at slip that flies high and into his hand but too hard, and he can\u2019t grab the rebound. 69th over: Australia 232-6 (Wade 100, Cummins 9) Wade must have been in the 90s for half an hour now.. England ask to change the ball, the umpire pushes it through his equivalent of a set-square with no problem and tosses it back to Broad, who is in again. And there it is, Wade turns the ball round behind him and scampers a single, punching the air, removing his helmet and raising his bat to the dressing room. That\u2019s a cracking hundred!!! 68th over: Australia 226-6 (Wade 99, Cummins 4) The cameras pan to the Australian balcony where Wade\u2019s teammates are watching... Cummins sees out five balls, then Root produces a finger-kissing beauty which just misses the edge of Wade\u2019s bat as he leans back. 67th over: Australia 225-6 (Wade 99, Cummins 3) Broad again, Wade tips a single to mid-on and scampers through for a quick single ...99... 66th over: Australia 223-6 (Wade 98, Cummins 2) Joe Root bowls an uneventful post-drinks over. In the unlikely situation that I had to create a crack team to go and menace someone for money I would consider Matthew Wade a good addition to a team consisting of Colin Croft, Ben Stokes, Dennis Lillee, Javed Miandad, Viv Richards, David Warner and Peter Willey. 57th over: Australia 201-6 (Wade 79, Cummins 0) Archer v Wade, the Hobart Hurricanes teammates return to the battlefront. Root moves Ben Stokes into a first-slip position, but 50? metres back on the boundary rope. On the forearms of the crowd, goose-pimples start to form. ARcher charges in, a couple of snorting bouncers, a couple of full length 90mph plus toe-crushers. Wade escapes with a single, then Cummins, on a king pair is greeted with a lifter that hits him on the arm guard. 65th over: Australia 222-6 (Wade 97, Cummins 2) And Wade takes a long, smooth, sigh of relief (internally, naturally) . Archer pulls on his sunhat and stays on the boundary, Broad pulls on his mantle. He\u2019s had a wonderful summer in the James Anderson slot. Reliable, clever, on top of his craft. Especially impressive after he spent last winter on the sidelines. Having said that, Wade is prepared to let Cummins face the last three balls of the over. And that, I think, is drinks. 64th over: Australia 221-6 (Wade 96, Cummins 2) And Cummins does his job again, playing out a Leach maiden. Michael Robinson deserves a mention: This an extremely late reply to a comment you made about the melodious score of 123-4. Surely more melodious reading would be 123 for 5? Similar to the old Eric Morecambe East Fife 4, Forfar 5 joke. 63rd over: Australia 221-6 (Wade 96, Cummins 2) Archer again - surely his last one, the eighth of this spell. He loses a tiny bit of control with this one. Wade outside edges the first ball tantalisingly close to gully for four. The second he bottom-edges to slip and Archer applauds. No bouquet though. Then a bouncer a wayward knuckle ball and another four through mid-on. Honours to Wade that over. 62nd over: Australia 213-6 (Wade 88, Cummins 2) Cummins sees off Leach\u2019s over, even getting off his pair with an inside edge off his pad for two. 61st over: Australia 211-6 (Wade 88, Cummins 0) This spell of Archer v Wade is feet-tappingly hypnotic. Archer persuades Root he can manage one more over; Wade strokes his beard like a Frenchman contemplating a later-afternoon espresso. Archer\u2019s up at 88-90-91-95mph. Vicious bowling, hitting Wade square on the upper arm. Wade is unmoved, hitting him for two fours, one delectable cover drive. 60th over: Australia 202-6 (Wade 80, Cummins 0) Cummins watches Leach carefully and defends, defends, defends, another maiden.... and so the overs tick by \u201cSo we\u2019re all set now for Wade to do a Ben Stokes and find the last 175 runs with the tail! Could Siddle be the new Leach? Does he wear specs? writes Peter Higginson I\u2019m so nervous I\u2019ve nearly eaten a whole box of Smoky Bacon Pringles since tea. Smoky Bacon? Ugh!!!! What were you thinking?At least they weren\u2019t, I almost can\u2019t bear to write it, Frazzles. 59th over: Australia 202-6 (Wade 80, Cummins 0) Wade copes relatively easily with four of Archer\u2019s deliveries, until he sends in a rapid yorker that muddles his feet in a powder puff of dust but Wade somehow digs it out. A maiden. And perhaps the end of this spell? 58th over: Australia 202-6 (Wade 80, Cummins 0) Leach is proving light relief between Archer examinations. Jeremy Pattison has also been squished at The Oval. Patrick Duce is right. It can take 20 mins to get from the Vauxhall end to the Pavilion at lunch as punters squeeze past each other at the pinch points behind the Peter May and the old Surridge stands. It would be better if it was made one-way and we were made to go clockwise. 56th over: Australia 200-6 (Wade 78, Cummins 0) A wicket maiden for Leach! The door is open now. And, fittingly, Paine\u2019s final DRS call is a wrong\u2019un. The ball pitches in line, and hits him two-thirds of the way up his back pad. The umpire takes forever to give Paine out lbw.... Paine reviews... 54th over: Australia 200-5 (Wade 78, Paine 21) And the number of runs needed drops below 200. Just saying. Wade pulls Archer with a stylish half-pirouette and that\u2019s the fifty partnership off 66 balls. Archer is riled . Three short balls follow, two of them over 90mph as the crowd noise swells behind him, loud and drunk. Archer at the end of the over gives Wade a cold, lingering, stare. 54th over: Australia 196-5 (Wade 74, Paine 21) Leach does get through his overs quickly. Um - just trust me on this one, not much happened. 53rd over: Australia 194-5 (Wade 73, Paine 20) The cameras linger for an uncomfortably long time over Ed Smith, who is in his trademark clear-rimmed sunnies and immaculately ironed shirt - white or light blue, I can\u2019t tell which. I wonder if he has a new shirt for each session? Apparently he\u2019s done a long interview in the FT this weekend, I\u2019ll try to dig it out. And that\u2019s a maiden for Archer. Tim de Lisle and Tone White have been dining at the same table. White writes: Afternoon Tanya, So nobody\u2019s planning to be there tomorrow morning while Paine and Cummins knock off the last thirty runs to win the match?! And Tim teases: 52nd over: Australia 194-5 (Wade 73, Paine 20) Is there anything that marks the end of summer more than a spinner toiling into The Oval dust with shadows lengthening at half past four. A maiden for Leach. Anthony Noel has been thinking: \u201cIf Lord\u2019s was a winning draw for England, does that mean England get a winning draw for the series too?\u201d I don\u2019t think you can have a winning draw if you lose the Ashes... 51st over: Australia 194-5 (Wade 73, Paine 20) Wade, who truly likes nothing better than stirring the pot, top-edges Archer over long leg and into the OSCS stand. On commentary, Atherton points out that a few years ago, before the new stand was built, that would not have been six. And lo! A couple of bouncers follow. 50th over: Australia 188-5 (Wade 67, Paine 20) Runs flowing freely for Australia after tea - six off this over, ten off the last. Paine untroubled by Curran and tips a straight one to the long leg rope. 49th over: Australia 182-5 (Wade 66, Paine 15) It\u2019s Archer. Wade drives him through cover for four. Then the ball flies leg side, off the thigh pad, past Bairstow to the boundary. Ooooh and now a big shout for lbw.... Erasmus shakes his head - and Root takes about four seconds to signal for a review .... but Erasmus was right - the ball pitched outside leg. I\u2019m thinking about the pressure of the captain shouting at me for my opinion against the clock. What happens if you freeze? This is why, amongst other, small, reasons, why I\u2019m not playing international cricket for England. An email! Thank you Patrick Duce Genuine question... if the Oval continues to expand in capacity, where are fans supposed to go in breaks etc? Surely getting to breaking point - it\u2019s like an overly-done sunburnt meat market of shuffling sozzled fans today. Maybe they could they just commandeer the neighbouring streets to give us some space to breathe? I haven\u2019t been to The Oval for a Test for a long time - I feel your pain as I hate that experience of being hemmed in but public spaces there are relatively spacious - no? 48th over: Australia 172-5 (Wade 61, Paine 14) Curran opens up after tea, scurrying in like a cartoon boy out of a Peanuts cartoon. Paine sends a full toss dripping with ripe juice trilling across the grass, slowing, slowing, but just crossing the rope. Roll up, roll up - this will probably be the final OBO session of the summer. Do send me your thoughts, and dreams if you like, at tanya.aldred.freelance@guardian.co.uk - many thanks to all of you who\u2019ve written in during the last five months and made doing this job so much fun. And thank you to Illuminations for a lovely tweet - I\u2019ll hail particularly our tireless front men - Rob and Geoff. Time for them too to put their feet up. 47th over: Australia 167-5 (Wade 60, Paine 10) Wade strokes Leach through the covers for four with toes on twinkling form. And again, striding down the pitch before setting off for a single that sends little puffs of dust up into the air. THEN A DROP! NO! A MISJUDGEMENT. Wade swings wildly at the penultimate ball before tea but the ball falls just short of Sam Curran running in from deep mid-wicket - he seems to lose it in the longest second as the ball descends. And that is tea! I\u2019m going to grab a cuppa, see you in twenty minutes. 46th over: Australia 160-5 (Wade 54, Paine 9) Long shadows starting to stretch away from the fielders in this weakening September sun. Stuart Broad chases down a lofted drive with admirable enthusiasm, then Paine stretches a gorgeous four through the covers. Root bowling in sunglasses, and one over to go before tea. 45th over: Australia 153-5 (Wade 51, Paine 1) England in their excitement review an Archer lbw shout against Paine, but it was missing by a welly boot and a half. A good decision by the umpire. Archer, perturbed, fizzes a bouncer through but the unfazed Paine drives him two balls later for four. 44th over: Australia 149-5 (Wade 50, Paine 1) Joe Root sprinkles some Yorkshire gold over the afternoon by breaking up what had been a promising partnership for Australia. The glee of the part-timer! Root tempts Marsh to prod at one on his legs straight into Buttler\u2019s waiting mitts at short leg. 43rd over: Australia 147-4 (Wade 50, Marsh 20) Archer tries a bouncer, that Marsh sways sleepily away from. And again, with that same sway. Next ball Marsh sends him whizzing through point for four. Archer not quite on the button yet. 42nd over: Australia 143-4 (Wade 50, Marsh 20) Joe Root brings himself on. And that\u2019s FIFTY for Matthew Wade - is this going to be one of those end-of-series centuries that then puts the selectors in a terrible pickle? Anyway, he\u2019s played really nicely here - 50 off just 65 balls, sweet footwork, full swing of the bat. 41st over: Australia 141-4 (Wade 49, Marsh 19) Marsh pings Archer through wide mid-off for a rather magestic four. Are all bat handles the same height? Marsh\u2019s bat looks pulled from a cracker. A lovely story from Rocket, a partner to the one Donald Last sent Geoff earlier this afternoon. \u201cGreat story from Donald Last. I have the equivalent Australian one (second hand). Forty years ago I met an old guy in Richmond called Jack and got to know him quite well. He told me that when he was a young lad he had walked to the MCG when Australia were playing England in the Bodyline Series 1932-33. He waited outside the ground (with many others doing the same) until it was known that Australia were batting, and only then used his precious money to get in so that could see Bradman bat. Australia lost their second wicket at 67, then Bradman got a bottom edge on a pull from Bill Bowes and was out first ball for zero (I think his only Test golden duck). Jack said he spent the rest of the day crying, and all that night - Bradman made a century in the second innings but being the Depression, young Jack could not afford to go to another day\u2019s play. He also told me how a few years before that, the Federal Labor Leader of the Opposition (when Federal Parliament was still in Melbourne before they moved to Canberra in 1927) would come into his parents\u2019 Milk Bar in the morning to buy a small bar of chocolate. The first time it happened Jack must have been only about 5 or 6 years old when he served him, and he said \u201cYes Mr Scullin\u201d, to which Jim Scullin said \u201cJust call me Jim\u201d. He said that Jim Scullin would then get catch the tram to Parliament, engaging passengers in talk about politics or sport on the way. A different world! ps - Jack lived to see his beloved Richmond Tigers win the 1980 Football Grand Final, but passed away a few years later. 40th over: Australia 136-4 (Wade 48, Marsh 15) A maiden from Leach, Marsh hemmed in by three crouching close catchers. 39th over: Australia 136-4 (Wade 48, Marsh 15) Ah! We have Archer back for his fifth over, wristband on his left arm, sleeve on his right, meandering in before whipping that arm over. Watchful for three balls, Wade then, with some aplomb, pulls him to fine leg where Jack Leach can\u2019t stop it going for four. Wade then ducks into a ball that doesn\u2019t rise very far and pings into his shoulder. Last week Sussex coach Jason Gillespie asked Trevor Bayliss if he could have Archer back for Sussex\u2019s last ditch bid for promotion to Division One of the Championship. He didn\u2019t get very far! 38th over: Australia 132-4 (Wade 44, Marsh 15) Leach raises both hands and half-heartedly appeals for an lbw that pitches just outside the line and taps half way up Marsh\u2019s front pad. Even he doesn\u2019t look very convinced. 37th over: Australia 130-4 (Wade 45, Marsh 14) The hardest of chances falls, as Marsh has a one-handed drive and ball flies to backward point where Rory Burns just gets a finger to it but manages only to parry it over the top. Then a possible run-out chance falls to Stuart Broad but Wade is well in. Wade then whips Woakes\u2019 final ball for four. Frustration for Woakes, who bowled his first ever called no ball in his Test career ten minutes ago, when Marsh was brilliantly caught by Burns. 36th over: Australia 123-4 (Wade 37, Marsh 13) The pitch is starting to spit for Jack Leach. Wade has an ugly swipe, Marsh a more delicate cut, then Wade gets all ways up and an inside edge onto the helmet for five, then sets off for a slightly mad run before being sent back. The score a melodious 123-4. 35th over: Australia 116-4 (Wade 36, Marsh 12) Thanks very much Geoff, who is somehow still standing after his summer of summers. I feel very much like I\u2019m slipping into my seat accompanied by the series death rattle. Something helped by the furry slippers I\u2019ve dug out from somewhere dusty under the bed. And then Marsh cuts Woakes for four. Disdainful? Yes. That\u2019s it for me. Can I self-indulge to say what a pleasure it has been to be part of the mighty Guardian OBO through an English Ashes summer, and the World Cup before that. Thank you all for your company, and your emails, and your whimsy, and your steely-eyed dedication to finding the TMS overseas link. Thanks to my colleagues on the OBO as well, and for the coup de grace I\u2019ll hand over to the excellent Tanya Aldred. Tony Brennan writes, cautiously. \u201cWere it to be the case that England wrapped this up, and we ended with a tied series and Australia retaining the Urn, I think it would be an entirely fair result. England haven\u2019t done enough to win, although each game has had its turning points, and if they had batted thirteen more overs at Old Trafford they would now be looking at a series victory. Australia have clearly been the better side, although a disproportionate amount of this is due to the parts played by Smith, Cummins and Hazlewood. I don\u2019t think it would feel right for Australia to win the series, given that the majority of their players have contributed so minimally. The twenty-year reunion would be a bit awkward (\u2018Your 700 runs were amazing, Smithy.\u2019 \u2018As were your 60, Cameron.\u2019) so all\u2019s fair.\u201d 34th over: Australia 111-4 (Wade 35, Marsh 8) A big England appeal as Marsh smashes a cover drive, on the bounce into Burn\u2019s foot at bat pad on the off side, from where it loops up to bat pad on the leg side. England hope it\u2019s a catch, but an umpire review shows the ball hit the ground just before Burns\u2019 boot. A maiden for Leach. 33rd over: Australia 111-4 (Wade 35, Marsh 8) A couple of leg byes added as Marsh misses one angled in. Then a single eased into the off side. Wade edges Woakes, but just in front of first slip. Then swishes and misses at a ball that moves away violently, and bounced. The pitch starting to misbehave? Australia 288 behind. 32nd over: Australia 108-4 (Wade 35, Marsh 7) A couple of singles as Leach wheels through another over. David Seare emails in. \u201cJust got home from work to see Steve Smith out. Had to check I hadn\u2019t slipped to another dimension.I think Australia have retained the Ashes because they have the two best players in Smith and Cummins. Also their bowling has been more consistent and threatening in general. England have had odd sessions where they didn\u2019t bowl well. It\u2019s a series Smith has dominated. Ben Stokes played the best knock I ever saw to burgle a game for England as well. It\u2019s been enjoyable to follow. Also glad I found the Lemon/Collins podcast. It\u2019s a good listen. Thanks.\u201d Fair summary, Dave. Though I\u2019d add that England would have won at Lord\u2019s with another hour to play with. Australia without Smith don\u2019t have a team. It\u2019s been a belting series though in terms of entertainment, and it\u2019s nice to watch the bowlers dominate for a change. 31st over: Australia 106-4 (Wade 34, Marsh 6) No run off the bat this over, just the no-ball. And the usual discussions begin about umpires not calling no-balls until a wicket falls from one. We know the answer to this. Have the fourth umpire watch the TV camera that is permanently on the front line anyway, and buzz the umpire at each overstep. We\u2019ve trialled it. It works. Get on with it, ICC... Marsh has a second chance. Must deliver with the bat to support his work with the ball. Straightforward dismissal \u2013 great catch by Rory Burns at third slip, diving across towards second, thick edge from Marsh, and he\u2019s halfway off the field. But the umpires check the replay and Woakes\u2019 foot is a few millimetres over. 30th over: Australia 105-4 (Wade 34, Marsh 6) Wade wants to get things along. Dances down to Leach, turning a ball into a full toss and stroking it through cover for four. Didn\u2019t try to overhit it. Down the pitch again and this time picks up the ball from the pitch, over midwicket this time. The deficit is under the psychologically vital 300 mark. It\u2019s 298. Make that 294, as this time Wade rocks back and cuts, behind point for four! Smart batting, making the bowler feed his shot. Then there\u2019s a huge crowd cheer as Wade drives back on the bounce to Leach. The bowlers throws at the stumps and hits the batsman, I think. Batsmen with more runs in a series than Smith: Weekes 779 Lara 798 Bradman 806 Bradman 810 Sobers 824 Walcott 827 Viv Richards 829 Neil Harvey 834 Mark Taylor 839 Hammond 904 Bradman 974 What a list. 29th over: Australia 92-4 (Wade 22, Marsh 5) Mitch gets off the mark with a clobber for four through the covers. It all feels rather irrelevant now though. End of term stuff. Paul Griffin has a question. \u201cGeoff, when do you plan to announce the Player Of The Series? Eagerly anticipating the verdict.\u201d 28th over: Australia 86-4 (Wade 21, Marsh 0) Leach to Wade. Just a bye from the over as the ball misbehaves out of the rough. \u201c\u2018HE\u2019S OUT!\u2019. Another echo of Bradman in the \u201830s.\u201d Quite right, Ian Forth. 27th over: Australia 85-4 (Wade 21, Marsh 0) Broad now has 3 for 34, but he\u2019ll rarely have a 1 in that first column more significant than this. Smith out to an actual plan, actually outdone by a bowler. Mitch Marsh is now in, and he\u2019s not going to knock off 314 with Wade. Can you believe it? I can\u2019t really believe it. THEY\u2019VE DONE IT! ENGLAND HAVE GOT STEVE SMITH OUT! For less than fifty! He\u2019s finally gone, and the leg slip trap has finally worked. England have tried this for many hours in many innings, but at last it bears fruit. Broad on the hip, Smith glances it away, and Stokes is there! Diving forward, taking the catch low above the ground! England will win this Test match now. 26th over: Australia 85-3 (Smith 23, Wade 21) Woakes. Width. Whacked. Wade. Down on one knee in proper left-hander\u2019s style, Wade flows through the covers for four. Australia\u2019s deficit is down to the small matter of 314. 25th over: Australia 81-3 (Smith 23, Wade 17) Broad to Smith, and there\u2019s a big lbw shout. I\u2019ll let you guess what happened. Anyone? Smith had walked across and was well outside the line. He follows up with an outrageous shot. Full but outside off, and Smith plays a hockey shot on-drive, a whip through the line but twisting his wrists at the moment of impact to send it straight through long-on rather than down to mid-off. Four! 24th over: Australia 77-3 (Smith 19, Wade 17) Smith works away a single from Woakes in his time-honoured style, and that is his 770th run for the series. So he goes past the 769 he made when India visited in 2014-15. Wade tries to whack across the line but drags it to Buttler at midwicket. Here\u2019s an email. \u201cI was at the Oval 71 years ago, sitting behind the bowlers arm, and saw Bradman bowled for a duck by Hollies. The image is as clear to me this day as the moment it happened. Bradman stepped across his wicket to make a pull shot and was bowled. We were mortified. It was our last chance to see one of the greatest batsmen ever and he was out second ball. Nothing, but nothing, can compensate for that loss. I had read how Bradman trained his eye by throwing a golf ball against a garage door and hitting it with a stump, not a bat, a stump. And that is what I did, as probably countless other youngsters. We wanted to be Bradmans.\u201d Thanks for the message, Donald Last. If you were there 71 years ago and still here to tell us about it, then you\u2019ve lived up to your surname. 23rd over: Australia 76-3 (Smith 18, Wade 17) Broad at the other end, but Wade handles better than any other left-hander so far. Carves away a boundary behind point, then clips three more runs behind square. and gets off strike. That\u2019s how to do it. Smith adds only a leg bye. 22nd over: Australia 68-3 (Smith 18, Wade 10) This may sound like a snide joke, but I had legitimately forgotten that Chris Woakes was in the team. He started with the ball after lunch and I was trying to work out who it was. He didn\u2019t bowl at all in the first session. Joe Root\u2019s use of him this whole series has been bizarre. He starts with a maiden. Isa Guha is to become the face of cricket on the BBC from next summer when a portion of the sport returns to the terrestrial broadcaster for the first time in 21 years. The former England international is understood to have signed up as the BBC\u2019s lead anchor for the five-year rights deal that includes nightly Test highlights, three live T20 internationals per season and both men\u2019s and women\u2019s games in The Hundred. Guha, part of the England team that won the Women\u2019s World Cup and Ashes in 2009 and a regular commentator on Sky and Test Match Special, represents a fresh start for cricket on the BBC, who take over the evening Test highlights from Channel 5 and are considering a revamp of the format. The BBC\u2019s first live offering since 1998 includes two live England men\u2019s T20 internationals per season and one featuring the women\u2019s side. But it is the Hundred that the ECB are hoping will capture the public\u2019s imagination despite a rocky start. Ten men\u2019s fixtures in the new format, and eight of the women\u2019s games, will be shown live on terrestrial television, including the finals of both. Andrew Flintoff has also been mooted as a host, given his existing BBC deal as a presenter of Top Gear, while the likes of Alison Mitchell, Ebony Rainford-Brent, Michael Vaughan and Jimmy Anderson are expected to cross over from Test Match Special\u2019s list of broadcasting talent. England are in the driving seat to level this series up 2-2. It was Broad again, monstering Australia\u2019s left-handers off the top, and another failure for the opening batsmen. Warner and Harris both went cheaply, then Jack Leach came into the game with his left-arm spin, drawing a stumping against Marnus Labuschagne. Entirely fittingly, it\u2019s all down to Smith. He looks a bit tired and distracted, and that\u2019s not an omen of a big innings. But even if he can bat long, who can stay with him? The scorecard is as thin going down the order as it has been above. We\u2019ll be back in half an hour or so to see who can do what, and when, and how, and where. 21st over: Australia 68-3 (Smith 18, Wade 10) Plenty of action even in a maiden for Wade, as he skips down a couple of times but doesn\u2019t get a shot away for runs. And that is lunch. Nick Parish emails. \u201cIt would be fascinating to know what percentage of the 3.5 tests he\u2019s played in have included Steve Smith on the field. Any OBOer got nothing better to do than calculate it? I reckon it must be pushing 80%.\u201d 20th over: Australia 68-3 (Smith 18, Wade 10) Smith takes a few balls but gets a single away off the pads from Curran. Wade is positive again, opening the face to drive with the outswing away through cover for three runs. 19th over: Australia 64-3 (Smith 17, Wade 7) Smith is still swinging against Leach, and my sense that he might not be long for this innings is increasing. He doesn\u2019t play like this when he\u2019s settled. He lashes to cover, then drives airily towards mid-off and sees it bounce in front. Then plays a sweep shot, which really isn\u2019t one of his strokes, and gets it nervously between keeper and bat-pad for one. Wade advances and drives two along the ground. Australia need 335. He\u2019s gone past Alastair Cook\u2019s 766 runs in that win in Australia in 2010-11. 18th over: Australia 61-3 (Smith 16, Wade 5) Perhaps a helpful result for Australia is to have a left-hander facing the left-arm swing of Curran. Wade doesn\u2019t look too fussed as he blocks, leaves, then ducks a couple of short balls. A third maiden. 17th over: Australia 61-3 (Smith 16, Wade 5) Matthew Wade to the crease, Mitchell Marsh to come. It\u2019s not exactly an inspiring Test batting line-up for Australia with 343 still to get. They need another ton from Wade. He starts by clobbering a sweep for four. Then turns away a single behind square. Joe Root is in at leg slip, after there was a lot of chat between he and Wade when Root was batting. A huge one for Jack Leach! Australia\u2019s most important partnership is broken, as Labuschagne loses his balance trying to get forward to Leach, beaten in flight and his back toe lifts up. Bairstow is fast enough with the gloves, and the third umpire confirms that the batsman is out! 16th over: Australia 55-2 (Labuschagne 14, Smith 15) Marnus gets away from Curran after a while, nudging a run, then Smith tries to whack another cover drive and misses out. I\u2019m not sure that Smith will make a big score today, he just doesn\u2019t seem settled. He nudges a run to square leg, and goes past Brian Lara\u2019s 765 runs in England in 1995. 15th over: Australia 53-2 (Labuschagne 13, Smith 14) What was that, Steven? That was Derbyshire Steve rather than Ashes Steve. He wanted to plonk the spinner down the ground but ending up mistiming his loft towards long-on. Luckily for him the contact was so poor that his shot falls short of the man on the rope. A single. 14th over: Australia 51-2 (Labuschagne 12, Smith 13) Curran continues. He\u2019s swinging the ball into the right-handers\u2019 pads, then sometimes changing up to angle one across. Draws Labuschagne into a couple of shots and beats the edge twice. Marnus leaves the next couple. Curran\u2019s second maiden. 13th over: Australia 51-2 (Labuschagne 12, Smith 13) A change in the bowling with Jack Leach on. Broad has done the new-ball job tremendously once again. Two wickets for him. Now the middle overs begin, with Australia moving past their fifty with a couple of singles. 348 to win. 12th over: Australia 49-2 (Labuschagne 11, Smith 12) A maiden for Curran against Labuschagne, who has built his accidental Ashes on discipline, but falters to have one wide drive at a ball slanted across him. Missed. 11th over: Australia 49-2 (Labuschagne 11, Smith 12) Labuschagne not afraid to take on the short ball from Broad, even for a single to the deep. Then another boundary for Smith as Broad bowls in inswinger that Smith with his movement across can glance to fine leg. That takes Smith past Mudassar Nazar\u2019s 761 runs for Pakistan against India in 1982 and 1983. 10th over: Australia 44-2 (Labuschagne 10, Smith 8) Sam Curran starts off, and he\u2019s bowling well immediately. Testing out Marnus on the pads, nearly lbw but for an inside edge. Then pushing just across Smith, drawing a cover drive that could bring some risk of an outside edge. The next is straighter, and Smith drives through mid-on, under Jofra Archer for four! Good shot, but maybe it could have been stopped. Smith goes past Bradman\u2019s 759 runs from the 1934 Ashes. No big deal. 9th over: Australia 39-2 (Labuschagne 9, Smith 4) So Broad got Warner seven times in the series. And Warner has the lowest aggregate for any opener who has batted ten times in a Test series. Labuschagne gets a single from Broad. The standard Australian score of 2 for not many has settled into place. Well, this is the power of the OBO. We mentioned Gang of Four earlier, and now the band\u2019s own Jon King has emailed in. \u201cSo proud my band, Gang of Four, gets a name check. There, shamelessly did it again! Back in the day in Leeds, sharing a flat with Mark White and Andy Corrigan of the Mekons, it was always a toss up for our guests to hear either Berlin-era Bowie, or TMS. Keep up the brilliant work!\u201d 8th over: Australia 38-2 (Labuschagne 8, Smith 4) Labuschagne\u2019s bright start continues, cleanly off the pads from Archer for one. Smith deflects Archer to the fine leg boundary, but it\u2019s off the thigh pad rather than bat. Smith yet to get off the mark then. But he\u2019s away two balls later, a gorgeous cover drive from Archer, on the rise! Not all of Smith\u2019s shots through cover look good, but the timing there was suave. He goes past Graham Gooch\u2019s 752 in a series against India in 1990, and Denis Compton\u2019s 753 when South Africa visited England in 1947. 7th over: Australia 29-2 (Labuschagne 7, Smith 0) The over starts well for Australia: Marnus drives a full ball for four, then flicks three more runs through midwicket. Jack Leach\u2019s run after the ball looks like the little dude in the original Nintendo handset Donkey Kong game. No barrels to jump over. But Broad knocks down Warner thereafter. Smith arrives, walking across to defend Broad, then playing that twisty-wrist cover drive at a wide one that hits the field. And right on cue, there he goes! Warner\u2019s miserable Ashes comes to an end with one last dismissal. Scrambled seam from Broad, moved away slightly, Warner was only trying to defend from the crease but the delivery is back of a length and takes a fat edge at a nice height to third slip. Two down, and in comes Steve Smith! 6th over: Australia 22-1 (Warner 11, Labuschagne 0) Archer to Warner, edged through the cordon for four! Luck there for Warner, it flew into the gap between slip and gully. It hits the boundary, and Warner is into double figures for the second time this season. I\u2019d like to say that this might be enough to get him going, but it\u2019s hard to see that from here. 5th over: Australia 18-1 (Warner 7) Another failure for Harris. Another wicket in the first 10 overs for Broad, who has a stack of them this series. Marnus Labuschagne will make another early trip to the middle. Off stump out of the ground! Last ball of the over, a beauty from Broad! Warner had taken a single to rotate strike, Harris had played a lovely on-drive for four, and Australia\u2019s total of 18 was their highest opening stand for the series. But that\u2019s as far as it goes. A bit of movement, Harris plays inside the line, and it takes out off stump. Broad erupts. England riot. 4th over: Australia 13-0 (Harris 5 Warner 7) The frying of David Warner continues. A slight sizzling sound and smoke coming from his ears. He tries to wipe an Archer delivery from outside off and misses. Then gets one in at his pads and misses again. Bairstow behind the stumps goes up in appeal but Archer doesn\u2019t, it was going down leg. Archer bowls a bit short, and Warner slaps him through cover for four. A buccaneering shot, not one that indicates composure. Then Warner sprints a single, tucking it to mid-on and going with the shot, and Harris really has to motor as Broad throws to the striker\u2019s end. \u201cWhat I hope will happen: Australia 200/1 overnight and Smith\u2019s not even in yet,\u201d writes Kev McMahon. \u201cWhat I think will happen: Australia 73/8 at tea. Smith falls over his own feet in one of his elaborate leaves, falls and breaks his hand.\u201d 3rd over: Australia 8-0 (Harris 5 Warner 2) Harris facing Broad looks a better outcome for Australia. Mind you, Harris might need to face all of Archer as well. At least for four balls of the over, Harris leaves and blocks without incident. Then Broad sends down a scrambled-seamer that decks away, beating the edge! Lovely bowling. And a equally good riposte, as Broad overpitches from the last ball and is driven straight for four. Good batting pitch, as we said... 2nd over: Australia 4-0 (Harris 1, Warner 2) Archer to start from the Vauxhall End, which is so named because that\u2019s where he parked his car. Pace and carry from him, as he operates around the wicket to Harris and outside the off stump. Eventually he slips onto the pads and Harris jabs an airborne glance to fine leg. He\u2019s under as much pressure as Warner, really. Three Tests for Harris this series and no contributions. Warner on strike, and is immediately beaten again as he pushes at a fuller ball. The last ball is wider and he leaves. 1st over: Australia 3-0 (Harris 0, Warner 2) Broad to start. Warner has taken the first ball in his last couple of innings, but doesn\u2019t today. Harris though gives him the second ball, running a leg bye off the thigh pad. Warner does not look comfortable immediately. Gets beaten outside off, stabs a couple of runs off his pads, then gets beaten again pushing hard at the ball down the line. That was a beautiful bit of bowling, moving away. He survives the first over, though. Adrian Armstrong has been busy. Ian Forth\u2019s reference to Gang Of Four set me wondering whether the post-punkers\u2019 oeuvre might generate a complete Boycott XI. Here goes: Natural\u2019s Not In It If I Could Keep It For Myself Outside The Trains Don\u2019t Run On Time He\u2019d Send In The Army It Is Not Enough The World At Fault Better Him Than Me [the run-out modus operandi] Do As I Say England\u2019s In My Bones First World Citizen Stranded [those run-outs again] Here\u2019s Boris Starling. \u201cLike all Englishmen of a certain age, my instinctive thought when England are defending a substantial lead in the fourth innings can be summed up in two words (Lord\u2019s, Greenidge) and two numbers (1984, 214*). And no, I can\u2019t shake the sinking feeling that Oval, Smith, 2019 and 200ish* is on the cards (224 to overtake Bradman\u2019s record, if my maths is right).\u201d You\u2019re spot on, Boz. \u201cWhat do you reckon the chances of Warner having an match defining innings and making double figures today?\u201d asks David Kalucy. Given the way he batted in the first innings, not great. He looked completely frazzled. Here\u2019s the TMS overseas link for those who want some audio with the chase as well as my sweet, sweet written words. That\u2019s the tally then! A monster for Australia to chase, nearly 400 runs. There have been four winning run chases bigger than this in Test history. So that\u2019s against them, but for them is having Steve Smith and a decent day-four pitch and two days to play. With the time in hand and the good weather, the draw will be impossible. So Australia will bat for a 3-1 lead, and England will bowl to tie the series 2-2 and spoil the party. Leach couldn\u2019t cope with Broad going past his score, clearly, and wanted to retake the lead. He goes down on one knee and tries to slog-sweep Lyon, but only gets a high top edge that swirls before settling with mid-on. 95th over: England 329-9 (Leach 9, Broad 12) Cummins to Broad... and he nails him! Broad nails Cummins, I mean! The backaway swat shot connects at the third attempt, and connects well. Broad was waiting for it, camped back like a baseballer, didn\u2019t even think about getting forward. Bat over the shoulder in his backlift, then follows through. Siddle at deep midwicket thinks he\u2019s in the hunt, but it sails over his head for six. So Cummins bowls short again, and Broad misses. And again, and Broad misses. This is the stupidest bowling I have ever seen. Broad is stepping almost off the cut strip. All Cummins has to do is bowl at the stumps: fast ball, slower ball, whatever. There\u2019s no way Broad is carving the yorker off his middle stump behind point for four. So what does Cummins do? Bowls short and gets hit for six more. Even straighter over midwicket this time, Siddle running around to no avail. Steve Smith was at long stop for that ball, right behind Tim Paine on the boundary. Then Paine calls Smith up, and Cummins bowls a length ball that goes over middle stump. What. 94th over: England 317-9 (Leach 9, Broad 0) Leach looks pretty good this morning, dipping his knees and driving to point but not beating the field. He\u2019s not shabby with the blade. Knocks a ball to leg side, then gets a little leading edge behind point, but can\u2019t find a run from the over. Broad will have to face Cummins again. 93rd over: England 317-9 (Leach 9, Broad 0) Out comes Stuart Broad, who of course made a Test hundred once but rather lost his enthusiasm for batting and is now all the way down at 11. Unsurprisingly he gets three short balls from Cummins, the first of which he blocks, and the latter two he backs away and swipes at and misses. He has his way. Tim Paine gets a review right! Ah, mercy! Ah, blessings! The Oval can do amazing things. The Oval is where Shane Watson overturned an lbw on review in 2013. Now Paine gets one! A glove down the leg side from Archer, just a tiny touch. Umpire says no. Computer says yes. Paine was very confident. That\u2019s the sort of call that a wicketkeeper might know more about than an lbw. Early breakthrough for the Aussies, who will be mighty relieved. Archer doesn\u2019t think he hit it. Like Warner in the first innings, it\u2019s not conclusive on the vision but there\u2019s a tiny spike on the Snickometer. 92nd over: England 317-8 (Archer 3, Leach 9) Hello all, thanks JP. Well, here we are! Glorious sun again, the classic London autumn. Perhaps the last day of this series, though Surrey will be desperately hoping that their sold-out fifth day goes ahead. Jerusalem over the loudspeakers. Erasmus and Dharmasena to the middle. Huge cheers for Jack Leach and Jofra Archer. Nathan Lyon starting with the ball, and Jack Leach carves him through cover for four! Geoff Lemon is whirling his arms over down at fine-leg trying to get my attention so I shall toss him the ball and doff my cap to you all. Hopefully we\u2019ll reconvene tomorrow for something absurd, but if not, thank you for all your contributions throughout the series. Remember: refresh your pages, redirect your tweets to @GeoffLemonSport and send your emails to geoff.lemon@theguardian.com. Ok, let\u2019s sharpen the focus with the restart nearing. England win, right? WinViz reckon it\u2019s 87% likely. But we all know Steve Smith\u2019s going to do something preposterous don\u2019t we, one final hit. Are we coming back tomorrow? Or is this it? Our summer dalliance fading with the weak autumn sunshine... Steve Smith\u2019s gone and done a nice Instagram. Derek Stocker must be unique, surely, a Zimbabwe supporter in Bulgaria. Anyway, he\u2019s sent an email. \u201cI am a Zim supporter but rooting for England. I hope today is the day the Teddy Bear does not come to the picnic. No doubt about Warner\u2019s talent and, I do have sympathy for him. I just imagine him going really big today. I hope my vision disappears to where it came from.\u201d It would be remarkable for such a talented player not to have at least one knock in a five-Test series, wouldn\u2019t it? Maybe the bit of needle that\u2019s crept into the contest is what he\u2019s needed? The music bug is catching. Ian Forth is the latest to join in with a quite excellent summer mixtape. \u201c1. Australians in Europe by The Fall. By way of an overture. 2. Midnight in a Perfect World by DJ Shadow. For those tuning in down under. 3. Heart Cooks Brain by Modest Mouse. Slightly misguided bumper sticker tribute to the previous England captain\u2019s strategic capabilities. 4. Monty Got A Raw Deal by REM. For those who think there should have been room for Monty and Swanny in the same side. 5. At Home He\u2019s A Tourist by Gang Of Four. For KP. 6. Why Won\u2019t They Talk To Me by Tame Impala. Also for KP. 7. The First Cut Is The Deepest by PP Arnold. For Joe Root. 8. I Just Get Caught Out by The Go Betweens. For every batsman in this series other than Smith. 9. I\u2019m Stranded by The Saints. For Jos Buttler. 10. I Know It\u2019s Over by The Smiths. For all of us, very soon. (Also for grumpy bowlers who\u2019ve just had their appeal turned down off the last ball). 11. Ashes to Ashes by Bowie. Because it\u2019s never really over, is it?\u201d I\u2019m only linking to The Fall for now, but there are plenty of bangers in that batting order. Ben Stokes has occupied centre stage for most of this summer but when it was time to take his bow at the Oval it arrived in subdued fashion. Ali Martin has more. When a drowsy Oval crowd offered Stokes the polite applause that a score of 67 might usually merit, a chance to thank the all-rounder for his efforts during this epic home season felt slightly missed. Stokes, unable to bowl in this Test and thus with just fielding left on the to-do list, has hit a new level as a batsman this year; the responsibility that some feared may be shackling his game before the World Cup has paid out some serious jackpots since. Joe Denly\u2019s runs yesterday were good for Joe Denly, but they were also handy for England selector Ed Smith, as Barney Ronay reports. Of all the new picks during the last 18 months Denly has perhaps been the most thoroughly Smith-flavoured, albeit not for the reasons some have assumed. One former Kent player laughed out loud at the idea Smith might pick his former teammate out of ties of matey loyalty. The response, in essence: if you think that, you obviously don\u2019t know Ed Smith very well \u2013 with the suggestion good old Joe from Canterbury is unlikely to figure too prominently in Smith\u2019s list of vital VIP personages to please at all costs. David Gaskell has identified the particular grade of salt to pour onto Australian wounds. \u201cWe have not had an imperious innings from Stuart Broad for some time. If memory serves me rightly, he did annoy and frustrate the opposition from time to time. Why not today? A handy thirty or so whilst the Boycott maxi- me that is Jack Leach blocks like a factor 50 on the French Riviera.\u201d As Emma John writes, it has been an extraordinary summer of cricket. But for England fans, the best-case scenario of a two-all draw scarcely seemed a reason to put the Mo\u00ebt on ice, not after a summer that had given us so many champagne moments already. We\u2019d been spoiled for storylines and the realisation that the Ashes weren\u2019t coming home \u2013 and England could still finish on the pointy end of a 3-1 scoreline \u2013 was as deflating as sitting through seven series of your favourite TV show only to discover that Bran Stark had won the Game of Thrones. (Still not over that, no.) Ah, the cry of \u201cAny tickets, buy or sell\u201d accompanied by the smell of police horse poo and the sight of a man dribbling meat pie down his front. You can\u2019t beat a major sporting event. If we\u2019re on a music trip, I\u2019ve finally found the Steve Smith song we\u2019ve been looking for. Here it is in all its ten minute glory. Here it is skipped to the good bit. Warning, this contains language not suitable for yelling within earshot of an umpire. Kim Thonger, I shall miss your morning emails when this series is over. \u201cIf \u2018It\u2019s Coming Home\u2019 doesn\u2019t describe England fan feelings this weekend, perhaps this does, Dark Black by Kristina Train. I\u2019ve been saving it for my funeral, but do \u2018enjoy\u2019 today as an Ashes farewell... \u201cI remember colors painted in my eyes Green was for the springtime, blue the summer skies And now the skies have darkened, the white clouds turn to grey What a way to break a heart, you took all the colors away Dark black is the color of my life Since you\u2019ve been gone Since you\u2019ve been gone Oh if you come back Make my whole world bright Since you\u2019ve been gone Dark black is the color of my life\u201d The lead stands at 382 with two fragile wickets remaining. It should be enough for England \u2013 if they can get Smith out. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of day four of the fifth Ashes Test from the Oval. It\u2019s coming home, it\u2019s coming home, it\u2019s coming! What? Speak up a bit. It isn\u2019t!? A shared series means Australia retain the Ashes? Oh well... The destination of the urn may have already been determined before battle commenced in south London but England turning in their most complete performance of the series so far is a welcome sight nonetheless for the majority of patrons inside a packed Oval. A strong day in the field on Friday was backed up by some refreshingly competent batting on Saturday to guide the hosts into a commanding position. It would take a Stokesian feat of escapology for Australia to wriggle free of their current predicament. Joe Denly has hogged the morning headlines, and most likely another series at the top of England\u2019s batting order, with his slow-burn series ending in impressive fashion. His obduracy, following on from Sam Curran\u2019s tenacity with the ball, have given England a steelier edge, much to Australia\u2019s dissatisfaction. For the first time during this long old tour of theirs they have looked tetchy, bordering on rattled, and ready for the next Qantas home. Whether they do so as jubilant series winners or content urn retainers will depend on how they occupy the crease over the next couple of days. We know with Steve Smith anything is possible... I\u2019m around for the hour leading up to play, after which it\u2019s over to Geoff Lemon. Please keep me company during this prelude, either on Twitter @JPHowcroft or by sending an email to jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com.",

Paul Gallen played the last of his 347 games in the same contest a 20-year-old called \u201cShmole\u201d played his first; and the kid won.

After the Raider had the ember removed he returned to the field and laid on the pass that sealed the match.</p> <p>Yet the Raiders won it with brutal, effective defence. It was muscular, fierce, physical. They peppered Storm fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen with bombs and rumbled him with gang tackles. They roughed him up and forced him back, and the fullback\u2019s input was restricted, as it was for superstar wingmen Vunivalu and Josh Addo-Carr.</p> <p>It was one of the Raiders\u2019s greatest wins in the past 25 years. Even master manipulator Cameron Smith couldn\u2019t talk his team out of the loss. Canberra will now play a home preliminary final against either Manly or Souths that will be the biggest game in Canberra since the \u201975 Dismissal.</p> <p>Ricky Stuart and his charges would not admit it but they were fortunate to lose to New Zealand Warriors in the final round and thus dodge Sydney Roosters. So emphatic were the premiers against South Sydney they\u2019re into even money to break the back-to-back premiership hoodoo. They have several of the game\u2019s best players and in James Tedesco they may have the best.</p> <p>So well did the Roosters perform it\u2019s debatable if a fit Jake Friend can force his way back into their best XVII. The form of spindly, dynamic rake Sam Verrills may keep the club co-captain on the pine.</p> <p>The Roosters welcomed back several stars and ran roughshod over a team that had beaten them in a \u201cdead rubber\u201d last round. They\u2019ll play the winner of Melbourne Storm and Parramatta Eels at the Sydney Cricket Ground in a fortnight.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Manly Warringah Sea Eagles overcame asbestos on the hill and a horrible injury toll to upset the visiting Cronulla Sharks. The home team called on several players with more games for Blacktown Workers than for Manly. So unexpected was the 28-16 victory that neutral fans were cheering for the Silvertails as sentimental underdogs. It won\u2019t happen again after such an ambush.</p> <p>Manly coach Des Hasler is something of an alchemist. He seems to imbue men with belief and the talent of the fallen. The Sea Eagles went into the match without their best back, Tom Trbojevic, best middle-man, Marty Taupau, and two experienced and tough, running edge-forwards in Joel Thompson and Curtis Sironen.</p> <p>Addin Fonua-Blake and Moses Suli made more hard charges than Lord Cardigan\u2019s 13th Light Dragoons. Suli was immense \u2013 13 runs, 177 metres, two line-breaks and a try. Fonua-Blake (a game-high 187m, one try, a shirt-lift to show off a tattoo that read \u201cTonga\u201d) and the perpetual Jake Trbojevic led a borderline anonymous sextet - Sean Keppie, Corey Waddell, Jack Gosiewski, Haumole \u201cShmole\u201d Olakau\u2019atu, Lloyd Perrett and Toafofoa Sipley \u2013 to a crushing defeat of a Sharks pack full of Test and Origin players but which had limped into seventh on the ladder and proved worthy of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/sep/15/sportwatch-lightning-v-swifts-in-super-netball-grand-final-live\">Sportwatch: Swifts dominate Super Netball grand final, Eels v Broncos, and more \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the last final of the weekend Brisbane took on Parramatta at Bankwest Stadium where the Eels had gone unbeaten in four games in the afternoon time slot.

Their major weapon was Anthony Milford\u2019s imposing but ultimately \u2013 given the lack of effort in kick-chase - ineffective bombs. And on the back of effective work around the ruck Parra\u2019s talented halves - Mitchell Moses and Dylan Brown - were freed up to feed large weapons on both edges.</p> <p>The Eels now face the serious prospect of a wounded Melbourne Storm at AAMI Park.

      "bodyText": "Rugby league has an endless capacity to surprise. Funny things keep happening. Odd things. Weird things. Things that shouldn\u2019t happen, happen. And when they do, pundits sit back and stroke their imaginary beards and declare: \u201cFunny game, rugby league.\u201d It\u2019s like saying Darwin can get a tad warm. The NRL\u2019s long weekend of qualifying and elimination finals featured an asbestos scare, an exposed tummy tattoo of Tonga, and a rogue firecracker that rattled around a player\u2019s eyeball. Paul Gallen played the last of his 347 games in the same contest a 20-year-old called \u201cShmole\u201d played his first; and the kid won. There were four matches and two upsets. Canberra Raiders upset Melbourne Storm 12-10 in the second qualifying final in a match in which a touch judge called Suliasi Vunivalu out when he was not, the Raiders tackled like crash test dummies on a bet, and a spark from a firecracker shot into BJ Leilua\u2019s eye before kick-off and nearly saw him forced out of the fixture. After the Raider had the ember removed he returned to the field and laid on the pass that sealed the match. Yet the Raiders won it with brutal, effective defence. It was muscular, fierce, physical. They peppered Storm fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen with bombs and rumbled him with gang tackles. They roughed him up and forced him back, and the fullback\u2019s input was restricted, as it was for superstar wingmen Vunivalu and Josh Addo-Carr. It was one of the Raiders\u2019s greatest wins in the past 25 years. Even master manipulator Cameron Smith couldn\u2019t talk his team out of the loss. Canberra will now play a home preliminary final against either Manly or Souths that will be the biggest game in Canberra since the \u201975 Dismissal. Ricky Stuart and his charges would not admit it but they were fortunate to lose to New Zealand Warriors in the final round and thus dodge Sydney Roosters. So emphatic were the premiers against South Sydney they\u2019re into even money to break the back-to-back premiership hoodoo. They have several of the game\u2019s best players and in James Tedesco they may have the best. So well did the Roosters perform it\u2019s debatable if a fit Jake Friend can force his way back into their best XVII. The form of spindly, dynamic rake Sam Verrills may keep the club co-captain on the pine. The Roosters welcomed back several stars and ran roughshod over a team that had beaten them in a \u201cdead rubber\u201d last round. They\u2019ll play the winner of Melbourne Storm and Parramatta Eels at the Sydney Cricket Ground in a fortnight. Elsewhere, Manly Warringah Sea Eagles overcame asbestos on the hill and a horrible injury toll to upset the visiting Cronulla Sharks. The home team called on several players with more games for Blacktown Workers than for Manly. So unexpected was the 28-16 victory that neutral fans were cheering for the Silvertails as sentimental underdogs. It won\u2019t happen again after such an ambush. Manly coach Des Hasler is something of an alchemist. He seems to imbue men with belief and the talent of the fallen. The Sea Eagles went into the match without their best back, Tom Trbojevic, best middle-man, Marty Taupau, and two experienced and tough, running edge-forwards in Joel Thompson and Curtis Sironen. Addin Fonua-Blake and Moses Suli made more hard charges than Lord Cardigan\u2019s 13th Light Dragoons. Suli was immense \u2013 13 runs, 177 metres, two line-breaks and a try. Fonua-Blake (a game-high 187m, one try, a shirt-lift to show off a tattoo that read \u201cTonga\u201d) and the perpetual Jake Trbojevic led a borderline anonymous sextet - Sean Keppie, Corey Waddell, Jack Gosiewski, Haumole \u201cShmole\u201d Olakau\u2019atu, Lloyd Perrett and Toafofoa Sipley \u2013 to a crushing defeat of a Sharks pack full of Test and Origin players but which had limped into seventh on the ladder and proved worthy of it. In the last final of the weekend Brisbane took on Parramatta at Bankwest Stadium where the Eels had gone unbeaten in four games in the afternoon time slot. The home team made long running metres down both flanks in the first half and wherever they liked in the second. They looked bigger, faster and more athletic - and even more interested, dominating the visitors to win 58-0, the greatest margin ever in an NRL final, and the greatest flogging in Broncos history. Brisbane were embarrassing. Their major weapon was Anthony Milford\u2019s imposing but ultimately \u2013 given the lack of effort in kick-chase - ineffective bombs. And on the back of effective work around the ruck Parra\u2019s talented halves - Mitchell Moses and Dylan Brown - were freed up to feed large weapons on both edges. The Eels now face the serious prospect of a wounded Melbourne Storm at AAMI Park. Can they win? Funnier things have happened, some of them this weekend.",

Climate crisis confronts Morrison When parliament resumes on Monday Scott Morrison will play host to Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama. Defence, labour mobility, trade, investment, illegal fishing and climate change are all on the agenda for the bilateral meeting. Bainimarama was heavily critical of Morrison at the Pacific Islands forum, saying the Australian PM had insulted and alienated Pacific leaders over his failure to back stronger emissions targets. The climate crisis will also be forced back onto the agenda by the member for Warringah, Zali Steggall, who will bring a motion, seconded by independent MP Helen Haines, calling on the government to decarbonise the economy by 2050 to reduce the health impact and linking it to extreme weather events. Earlier in September the Australian Medical Association formally declared climate change a health emergency; Steggall\u2019s call will be backed by peak health bodies pointing to heat related illnesses, respiratory diseases and hypoallergenic conditions caused by global heating. Australia is in the grip of early-spring fires in New South Wales and Queensland and a drought that could see parts of NSW run out of water as early as November. Steggall said the \u201cunprecedented fires\u201d and the \u201cshocking drought\u201d are \u201cevents causing terrible health impacts which are going to get more severe as the world continues to warm\u201d.

On Sunday Anthony Albanese said Labor expects Liu to make \u201ca statement to the parliament about the contradictions in the statements that she has made\u201d. On Monday Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick will renew his push for a parliamentary inquiry into Australia\u2019s economic and security relationship with China, which was first defeated last Monday by the Coalition and Labor. Patrick told Guardian Australia the controversy over Liu strengthens the case for an inquiry because China is \u201cpopping up in the news every day\u201d, with each individual event and flashpoint in the relationship \u201cadding to calls\u201d for a broader inquiry. However, the Centre Alliance senator said Liu is \u201cnot directly relevant\u201d to its terms.

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales government is advising local councils to invoke terrorism fears to keep the location of potentially lethal flammable cladding secret from the public. The 2017 Grenfell Tower tragedy in London and 2014 Lacrosse fire in Melbourne have prompted widespread fears about flammable cladding in buildings across Australia. In NSW, a taskforce has spent two years auditing 185,000 building records to understand how widespread flammable cladding is. Laws have been introduced requiring the owners of some buildings with external cladding to place themselves on registers accessible to local councils and the state government by February. Members of the public and the Greens MP David Shoebridge have sought access to those registers through the state\u2019s equivalent of freedom of information laws. But Guardian Australia has obtained an internal missive sent by the NSW government to local councils last month warning them the cladding information is \u201chighly sensitive\u201d and advising them the release of the documents may be contrary to the public interest. Councils were advised to \u201cconsult\u201d the planning department before making decisions, and were given examples of three common reasons to reject requests: the potential to affect property prices; to derail the taskforce\u2019s work; or to create a risk of \u201cterror\u201d and arson. In one recent case, the state government cited all three in advising City of Ryde not to release cladding registers. The council rejected the concerns, and on Tuesday decided to release the register. The council\u2019s decision stated that the NSW government did \u201cnot include any corroborated reasons why disclosure would reasonably be expected to result in an act of terrorism\u201d. \u201cThe [Department of Planning, Industry and Environment] has noted in their objection that the possibility of an attack on a building that has been identified as having an amplified danger is very real and that if the list of buildings \u2026 that may have flammable cladding were made available to the public, this has the capacity to enlarge the risk of arson and terrorist attacks,\u201d the council\u2019s decision-maker wrote. \u201cI am not qualified to determine whether disclosure of the information could result in an act of terrorism or whether it has the capacity to enlarge the risk of arson and terrorist attacks, however the DPIE\u2019s representation does not include any corroborated reasons why disclosure would reasonably be expected to result in an act of terrorism.\u201d Shoebridge, who lodged the City of Ryde request, said there was little doubt the properties identified would take a temporary hit in value. But he said the release of the documents was critical to improving the response to cladding, and criticised the government for attempting to \u201cgag\u201d councils by raising the prospect of terrorism. \u201cThe state government is making unsupported and exaggerated claims about terrorism and arson threats in a thinly veiled attempt to scare councils away from releasing information about combustible cladding,\u201d Shoebridge said. \u201cPeople living in these buildings have a right to know if they\u2019re at risk. Anyone thinking of renting an apartment or buying an apartment also has a right to know and it\u2019s about time the state government understood that.\u201d A planning department spokeswoman said it was acting on the advice of emergency services, which \u201ccounsel against the public release of this information\u201d. \u201cOther states, such as Victoria, have taken a similar approach to the public release of cladding information,\u201d she said. \u201cThe NSW government puts the safety of its communities first.\u201d NSW Fair Trading offers separate advice for residents wanting to find out whether their building\u2019s cladding is safe. A similar issue was experienced in Canberra during the Mr Fluffy asbestos scandal in 2015. The ACT government\u2019s release of the locations of 1,023 asbestos-affected homes angered some home-owners, but was viewed as necessary to fully inform and protect the public.",

Arsenal were once the toughest visitors in the land. Twice in three years, from 2001-04, they went through a whole Premier League season without losing away from home - a staggering achievement that is sometimes forgotten because of their Invincible season. </p> <p>The memory of that rugged, brilliant team made their decline under Arsene Wenger even more acute; by the end, they were often a mess away from home. That\u2019s improved slightly under Unai Emery, but Arsenal\u2019s away form is still their weak point. They are consistently good at the Emirates - only Manchester City have collected more points at home in the last five seasons - so their work on the road will probably decide whether they end a barren run of four whole years without finishing in the top four.</p> <p>Watford are starting again, again, after sacking Javi Gracia and replacing him with Quique Sanchez Flores. It would be unfair to call Watford a sacking club; by going back to Flores, the man they got rid of in 2016, they\u2019ve taken things to a whole new level.</p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 4.30pm.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T14:40:22.878Z\">at 3.40pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Post-match chat Tom Cleverley \u201cAt half-time we\u2019d have taken that, but with five minutes to go there was only one team who was going to win it, so we\u2019ve mixed emotions. Arsenal were a bit tentative; we smelt that a bit, and we said at half-time that if we got the next goal we had a massive chance. We can definitely build on that second half. We know we can compete with anyone, especially at home. Etienne Capoue \u201cWe\u2019re both disappointed and happy. We reacted very well, but we could have won today. We played well in the first 20 minutes and we knew we would get more chances in the second half. We gave everything today \u2013 we are so tired. We know we can do it, and this is good for the future.\u201d It\u2019s hard to know where to start with that match. Arsenal led 2-0 at half-time after two lovely goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. But Watford were relentless in the second half, and got back in the game through Tom Cleverley after some laughable defending from Arsenal. Roberto Pereyra\u2019s late penalty brought them level, and both teams had chances to win it. It was pulsating entertainment. Peep peep! A fine, uplifting game ends with honours even. Quique Sanchez Flores is back; so are Watford. They were wonderful. 90+2 min: Vital save from Leno! Doucoure almost scored the winner after a fantastic piece of play. He surged forward from deep inside his own half, beating Sokratis with a lovely bit of skill on the halfway line before finding Sarr on the right. Sarr fizzed a precise low cross to pick out Doucoure, whose sidefooted shot was smothered by the plunging Leno. This is tremendous stuff! 90+1 min It\u2019s like a basketball game now. Willock misses a great chance to play Aubameyang in at one end; then Cleverley\u2019s shot is blocked at the other; and finally Capoue is booked for stopping Arsenal\u2019s counter-counter-counter-attack. 90 min An abysmal pass from Xhaka on the edge of the Watford area allows the home side to break. Doucoure\u2019s vicious shot is blocked by Torreira. It\u2019s breathless stuff. 89 min Nelson wins the ball off Sarr and buys Arsenal a bit of time with a break down the left. Eventually Aubameyang\u2019s cross is miscontrolled by the stretching Xhaka, in a lot of space at the far post. A better touch there would have given him a great chance. 87 min Janmaat shoots well wide from the edge of the area. Watford have had 28 attempts on goal to Arsenal\u2019s seven. 86 min Doucoure\u2019s shot is blocked and comes to Cleverley, whose cracking rising drive is headed over by David Luiz. I think that was going in. Leno certainly wouldn\u2019t have got to it. 85 min Arsenal are all over the place. They are hanging on for dear life. 84 min So close from Deulofeu! Cleveley\u2019s shot was blocked by Sokratis and rebounded to Deulofeu, who drilled a low shot this far wide of the far post. 83 min Only one side looks like winning this game, and it\u2019s not Romania. Pereyra\u2019s cross is headed away by David Luiz, but Arsenal cannot get out. Pereyra passed the ball low to his left, with Leno going the wrong way. Watford deserve that for a stirring performance. Pereyra scores! VAR check: it\u2019s a penalty. It was just inside the area. Pereyra changed direction nicely, and David Luiz dangled a leg as only he can. David Luiz has fouled Pereyra right on the line of the area. 79 min Arsenal enjoy a bit of respite in the Watford half. Eventually, Torreira rattles a snapshot from 12 yards that is beaten away by Foster. 78 min Another Watford substitution: Daryl Janmaat replaces Jose Holebas. 76 min A comedy of errors almost leads to an equaliser. Nelson leads an Arsenal break, only for the ball to hit his heel and fall for Doucoure. He plays it wide to Sarr, whose low cross is miskicked by Kabasele near the penalty spot. That was a chance. 75 min Watford deserve an equaliser. Sarr\u2019s stinging shot from long-range hits a defender and goes behind for another corner. 72 min A rare Arsenal attack. Pepe does well to pick out Nelson, whose low shot from the edge of the box is comfortably saved by Foster. 71 min Arsenal\u2019s final change: Reiss Nelson replaces Mesut Ozil, whose devastating pass created Aubameyang\u2019s second goal. 70 min Technically, Watford\u2019s goal shouldn\u2019t have counted, because Deulofeu\u2019s foot was in the Arsenal area when the goalkick was taken. Apparently VAR can\u2019t get involved with restarts. Quite right, too; it\u2019s not like it led to a goal or anything. 69 min \u201cWhen,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cis Will Hughes going to complete his move to Liverpool?\u201d 68 min Deulofeu comes infield, past Maitland-Niles yet again, and hits another good shot that takes a deflection and spins wide of the far post. 67 min Guendouzi goes off for Arsenal, with Lucas Torreira replacing him. 67 min Deulofeu has been fantastic today. He starts another move that almost ends with an equaliser when Femenia\u2019s cross is flicked behind his standing foot and wide of the far post by Pereyra. 65 min: Fine play from Sarr! Deulofeu teased Guendouzi on the left of the area and played a short pass into Sarr, who had his back to goal. He stabbed the ball around David Luiz with his first touch, turned and hit a volley that drifted wide of the far post. The shot was mishit but the first touch was lovely. 63 min Deulofeu wins a corner for Watford. Before it is taken, Will Hughes is replaced by Roberto Pereyra. 60 min It\u2019s all Watford now, and Femenia blasts over from the edge of the area. Arsenal make their first change, with Joe Willock replacing Dani Ceballos. 58 min Another fine effort from Deulofeu, who zips infield from the left and curls a low shot that goes a few yards wide of the far post. That means a goalkick for Arsenal, and another chance for Watford. 56 min Kiko Femenia is booked for pulling Ozil\u2019s shirt to stop an Arsenal attack. 55 min Watford make a change, with the record signing Ismaila Sarr replacing Andre Gray. Moments later, the superb Deulofeu cracks a shot from the left of the box that is comfortably saved by Leno. What an absurd goal. Leno took a goalkick to Sokratis in the six-yard box. He telegraphed a straight pass to Guendouzi on the edge of the area that was intercepted by Deulofeu. His touch diverted the ball to Cleverley, who rammed a low shot past Leno from 15 yards. It\u2019s been coming. Arsenal have been playing silly buggers in their own area all day, and now they\u2019ve been punished. 52 min Doucoure, teed up nicely by Hughes, slices a shot miles wide from 20 yards. In fact, it\u2019s gone for a throw-in. 49 min Ozil finds Xhaka, who blasts over the bar from 35 yards. 47 min Guendouzi loses the ball in a very dangerous area again, this time playing a square pass straight to Gray in the Arsenal area. He\u2019s saved by Xhaka, who comes around the side of Gray to make a brilliant tackle. Moments later, Hughes cracks a first-time shot over the bar from 17 yards. 46 min Peep peep! Watford begin the second half, so they do. Half-time reading Peep peep! Arsenal lead through two brilliant goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The first was an expert finish; the second was a team effort inspired by Mesut Ozil. The scoreline is harsh on Watford, who started very brightly and have looked dangerous on the break. 45+2 min Holebas and Guendouzi are booked. 45+1 min It\u2019s all kicking off here! Holebas challenged Pepe near the halfway line, and suddenly players from both sides appeared to start a shoving match. 45 min Deulofeu, who has been excellent, charges into the area at pace only to run out of room after beating David Luiz. 44 min \u201cThe relationship between Ozil and Emery is a nuanced one, I think,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cMesut: \u2018I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t want me (but watch this!)\u2019; Unai: \u2018I can\u2019t afford you, I don\u2019t want you (but look at that!)\u2019.\u201d It fascinates me, given all type of criticism both men receive, that one of Ozil\u2019s biggest fans was Jose Mourinho. 43 min Kolasinac is booked for an oafish lunge at Hughes. 43 min \u201cThe NBC feed announcers are trashing the Watford back line,\u201d says Mary Waltz, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s more Arsenal quality then poor performance by Watford.\u201d They were two excellent goals, I thought. 41 min A win today would take Arsenal to third in the table, behind Manchester City on goal difference. 39 min Femenia wins a corner for Watford, who are still game despite the double blow from Aubameyang. David Luiz heads it away. 35 min A double chance for Watford! Guendouzi accepts a goalkick from Leno on the edge of the area, turns and loses the ball. Deulofeu whaps a low shot that Leno can\u2019t hold, and Gray puts the rebound into the side-netting. 35 min Femenia\u2019s cross is volleyed wide by Hughes, who got in front of David Luiz at the near post. 34 min Watford have played really well, and they\u2019re 2-0 down. It was made brilliantly by Ozil, who sliced the Watford defence open with a short, stabbed pass down the inside-right channel to find Maitland-Niles. He slid the ball across the face to give Aubameyang an open goal. The pass from Ozil, a sudden thrust of the dagger that took three defenders out of the game, was delicious. This is a beautiful goal! 30 min A dangerous Arsenal break is led by Ozil, who just underhits an attempted through pass to Pepe. A perfectly weighted pass would have put Pepe through on goal. 27 min Arsenal have played with greater confidence since the goal. Good game, this. 25 min That was almost 2-0. Ceballos found Ozil, whose deflected cross just evaded Aubameyang on the six-yard line. 23 min That goal was an affront to the run of play - Watford had been much the better side. Goal given! Hughes lost the ball near the halfway line after a tackle from Ceballos, who got a slight touch on the ball. Kolasinic picked up the loose ball and surged into space before sliding a short pass to Aubameyang in the area. He controlled the ball on the run, swivelled in the same movement and lashed a superb low shot past Foster. Aubameyang has had a touch now - he\u2019s put Arsenal ahead with a brilliant finish. Watford are asking for a VAR check after a challenge on Hughes near the halfway line. 20 min Arsenal\u2019s first effort. Guendouzi wins a 50/50 with Capoue and wafts a long pass to Pepe on the right. He moves infield, 25 yards from goal, and hits a left-footed shot that drifts a few yards wide of the far post. 18 min Arsenal haven\u2019t offered much in attack as yet. Aubameyang has barely touched the ball, while Ozil has just been robbed brusquely by Deulofeu. That sums up the first 18 minutes. 15 min This has been a superb start from Watford, who have looked really sharp on the counter-attack. 13 min: Holebas misses an excellent chance! Deulofeu wriggled past Maitland-Niles in the area and stabbed the ball back to the underlapping Holebas in the space on the edge of the area. He opened his body in an attempt to steer a first-time shot into the top corner, but he mistimed it and the ball went high and wide. 12 min Cleverley\u2019s speculative curler from long range is comfortably held by Leno. 11 min Deulofeu has started very well on the left for Watford. So has Cleverley, who forces a fine save from Leno with a fierce rising drive from 20 yards. Leno leapt to his left and fingertipped it over the bar. 8 min Holebas fouls Maitland-Niles just outside the area on the right. Ozil\u2019s inswinging free-kick is headed away from inside the six-yard box by Dawson. 6 min Deulofeu cuts inside Guendouzi, 20 yards out, and shapes a curler towards the far post. Leno fumbles a fairly routine take but manages to grab it at the second attempt. 6 min Cleverley\u2019s fast, low cross towards Gray is hoofed away at the near post. Watford look bright and breezy. 3 min It\u2019s been a frantic start to the game, and Watford look full of the joys of a new manager. 2 min Arsenal have started with a midfield diamond, as expected. Deulofeu scurries past one of those midfielders, Guendouzi, after a nice bit of skill on the halfway line. 1 min Peep peep! Arsenal kick off from left to right. They are in red; Watford are wearing yellow and black. It\u2019s a beautiful afternoon at Vicarage Road, and the returning Quique Sanchez Flores receives a huge cheer from the home fans. There\u2019s a cracking atmosphere. \u201cIs it statistically weird that only five teams in the Premier League have a positive goal difference,\u201d says Matt Dobbing. \u201cAppreciate it\u2019s only five games in.\u201d A little bit - at the same stage of the last two seasons there were seven teams with a positive goal difference. The pre-match thoughts of Quique Sanchez Flores \u201cWe need to be solid in defence, because we are playing against a very fast team with talent and skill. We need to be compact and well-organised, and to take our chances at the other end. We need to be brave with and without the ball. I am really happy to be back at Watford. I feel that I am in the right place again.\u201d Bournemouth are beating Everton 3-1 in the early Premier League game. You can follow the last few minutes with Will Unwin. Watford (4-2-3-1) Foster; Kiko Femenia, Dawson, Kabasele, Holebas; Doucoure, Capoue; Hughes, Cleverley, Deulofeu; Gray. Substitutes: Gomes, Foulquier, Janmaat Mariappa, Chalobah, Sarr, Pereyra. Arsenal (4-D-2) Leno; Maitland-Niles, Sokratis, David Luiz, Kolasinac; Xhaka; Guendouzi, Ceballos; Ozil; Pepe, Aubameyang. Substitutes: Martinez, Chambers, Saka, Torreira, Willock, Martinelli, Nelson. Referee Anthony Taylor. Hello. Arsenal were once the toughest visitors in the land. Twice in three years, from 2001-04, they went through a whole Premier League season without losing away from home - a staggering achievement that is sometimes forgotten because of their Invincible season. The memory of that rugged, brilliant team made their decline under Arsene Wenger even more acute; by the end, they were often a mess away from home. That\u2019s improved slightly under Unai Emery, but Arsenal\u2019s away form is still their weak point. They are consistently good at the Emirates - only Manchester City have collected more points at home in the last five seasons - so their work on the road will probably decide whether they end a barren run of four whole years without finishing in the top four. Watford are starting again, again, after sacking Javi Gracia and replacing him with Quique Sanchez Flores. It would be unfair to call Watford a sacking club; by going back to Flores, the man they got rid of in 2016, they\u2019ve taken things to a whole new level. Kick off is at 4.30pm.",

I\u2019m not a selfish person, I don\u2019t do it for myself, I wanted to do it for Beany [Catriona Matthew\u2019s nickname].\u201d A pause before she dissolves into the most happy tears. Plenty of emotion. \u201cThe support has been phenomenal, this is nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced in my whole life. They are honestly the 13th member of the team.

Half-an-hour ago it looked like a draw would be a good result, but those last three games were crucial. Just fantastic. I had faith in Pettersen all the time!

It really did seem all over for Europe, when Megan Khang wrested a half off Charley Hull and Lizette Salas put Anne van Dam to the sword. The USA were just half a point off retaining their trophy, one point away from overall victory. But right at that moment, Bronte Law and Suzann Pettersen salvaged halves at holes they looked destined to lose. Suddenly, it was possible.

And then Saturday belonged to the visitors. So we go into the final day of this to-and-fro tournament all square. Eight points apiece. Have you buckled in? Because here we go!</p> <p><strong>On paper, the USA should close this out and retain the cup they\u2019ve held since 2015. </strong>They\u2019ve got ten players in the world top 50, as opposed to Europe\u2019s six. And as holders they just need to reach 14 points to retain their trophy; Europe need 14.5 to snatch it back. But there\u2019s nothing quite like match-play singles, is there, and the USA have six rookies in their team. And they\u2019re significantly younger, with an average age of 25.5 compared to the hosts\u2019 28.2. These things shouldn\u2019t matter ... but it\u2019s the business end of the Solheim Cup, and you never know how it all comes down until everyone\u2019s out there on their own.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s been dramatic enough this week already. </strong>But of course here\u2019s where the story really begins. Can Juli Inkster\u2019s side keep a grip on the trophy the USA have won ten times already? Or will Catriona Matthew taste victory on home soil, bringing the cup back to Europe for the sixth time?

      "bodyText": "Congratulations to Europe, then, as they lift the Solheim Cup - their Solheim Cup - to the Perthshire sky. Commiserations to the USA team, who played a major part in a thrilling contest. And thanks to you for reading this live blog. I wasn\u2019t sure anything in golf this year would top the final day of the Women\u2019s British Open at Woburn, but I think this might have just managed it. What an afternoon! We won\u2019t be forgetting it in a hurry. Juli Inkster\u2019s gracious verdict. \u201cIt was great, great for women\u2019s golf. Look at these crowds, it was fabulous. The European crowds have been great to us all week. We\u2019ve had some Scottish weather, some wind, some sunshine, we got the full effect! I\u2019m proud of my team. Everyone got some sort of point. I\u2019m looking forward to 2021 ... watching! Watching! Thanks for having us.\u201d Team Europe, who have won the greatest Solheim Cup in the most amazing circumstances, take to the first tee for the trophy presentation. First up, there\u2019s a warm reception for the Americans, who will be hurting badly, but did so much to contribute to a fantastic week\u2019s golf at Gleneagles. Their captain Juli Inkster allows herself a wry smile. There\u2019s a cheeky glint in her eye as the camera catches her enjoying something cold from a beaker. She deserves a wee dram; her team were brilliant in their own way. But somebody had to lose, and so it\u2019s time to hand over that bonny crystal vase to Europe ... Let\u2019s have a look at that scoreboard then, now it\u2019s all done and dusted. And while Europe deservedly celebrate, you have to feel sorry for the Korda sisters, who both launched sensational comebacks to secure points for the USA ... only to see the hosts pull off a late, late counter-attack of their own! 1UP Ciganda v Kang Hedwall v N Korda 2UP 2&amp;1 Hall v Thompson 2&amp;1 Boutier v Park Munoz v Yin 2&amp;1 Hull A/S Khang Van Dam v Salas 1UP Masson v J Korda 3&amp;2 Ewart Shadoff v Altomare 5&amp;4 1UP Pettersen v Alex 2&amp;1 Law v McDonald 4&amp;3 Nordqvist v Pressel EUROPE 14\u00bd-13\u00bd USA And what about that Bronte Law, huh? \u201cHonestly, what just happened in the past 30 seconds, I\u2019ll never experience again. I love being part of a team, this is exactly what I play this game for. I\u2019m not a selfish person, I don\u2019t do it for myself, I wanted to do it for Beany [Catriona Matthew\u2019s nickname].\u201d A pause before she dissolves into the most happy tears. Plenty of emotion. \u201cThe support has been phenomenal, this is nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced in my whole life. They are honestly the 13th member of the team. They\u2019ve been screaming all day and it makes a massive difference. It gives you that pep in your step!\u201d What a player. What a fighter. She wasn\u2019t going to give that up, was she? Law simply oozes star quality. A major winner in waiting, though all that\u2019s for another day of course. The 18th-green hero Suzann Pettersen talks! \u201cIt\u2019s all just a big blur. It was a good putt. I was trying to make some kind of birdie. It\u2019s tough mentally. In your wildest dream, I never thought I\u2019d do this again. But you\u2019ve got to grab the moment and trust that you are good enough. This is just a fantastic win for the team. I didn\u2019t feel much pressure, I knew my teammates wanted me on the team, what you guys say is irrelevant!\u201d The winning captain Catriona Matthew speaks! \u201cJust unbelievable! There\u2019s never been a better moment! For it to come down to the last game ... the Americans played great as well, but for Suzann to get the winning putt is phenomenal. Half-an-hour ago it looked like a draw would be a good result, but those last three games were crucial. Just fantastic. I had faith in Pettersen all the time! This is the best moment, nothing tops this. There\u2019s gonna be a party!\u201d The 18th green is taken over by hundreds of well-wishers. Plenty of cavorting going on at the moment. There\u2019ll be a few nippy sweeties downed this evening! That is a quite sensational victory. It really did seem all over for Europe, when Megan Khang wrested a half off Charley Hull and Lizette Salas put Anne van Dam to the sword. The USA were just half a point off retaining their trophy, one point away from overall victory. But right at that moment, Bronte Law and Suzann Pettersen salvaged halves at holes they looked destined to lose. Suddenly, it was possible. And what moxie Law and Pettersen displayed to win their matches and close it out! What a smash-and-grab! What a story! What beautiful, gorgeous nonsense! Pettersen knocks it in! It\u2019s there! It was never missing! A gentle left-to-right slider that was always dropping! Pettersen\u2019s team-mates flood the green with blue, and Gleneagles erupts in celebration! How on earth did Europe salvage that! What a comeback, right at the death! And it\u2019s the captain\u2019s pick Suzann Pettersen with the winning putt. The last putt, in the last match, on the last green! The greatest Solheim Cup win ever? Pretty much, yes! 1UP Pettersen v Alex (F) EUROPE 14\u00bd-13\u00bd USA This drama really did explode out of nowhere. Europe looked to be sputtering to quiet defeat, but Pettersen and Law refused to go gentle into the night. On 17, Law lags up to secure her par. Up on 18, Alex\u2019s putt slides by on the right. It\u2019s all down to Pettersen, then ... especially as McDonald can\u2019t get up and down from sand at 17. It really is all down to Pettersen! She steps up ... and ... Pettersen A/S Alex (17) 2&amp;1 Law v McDonald (F) EUROPE 13\u00bd-13\u00bd USA Pettersen has just played one of the shots of the week! She lands her third 20 feet past the flag, and spins it back to six feet! That\u2019s put so much pressure on Alex. But she sends one over the flag. It\u2019s a fine shot, landing softly 12 feet past. Wow. This really is quite the shootout! Alex will be putting first. And if she makes her birdie, this is all over. If not, Pettersen will have a putt that would effectively win the Solheim Cup! Alex plays the percentages and lays up. Pettersen meanwhile has a good lie in the rough, 220 yards from the pin. But she decides against going for it. Instead she wedges onto the fairway alongside Alex. It\u2019ll set up a shootout. It\u2019s one Pettersen simply has to win. Meanwhile back on 17, Law finds the centre of the green, while McDonald hoicks her tee shot into the bunker at the back. It really is all down to Pettersen now. This approach could win or lose the Solheim Cup for Europe! Pettersen A/S Alex (17) 1 UP Law v McDonald (16) EUROPE 12\u00bd-13\u00bd USA It had been coming for a very, very, very long time: Anna Nordqvist finishes off Morgan Pressel, 4&amp;3. And on 16, Bronte Law guides a 20-foot right-to-left slider in for birdie, and the dream is not quite over for Europe! If Law can hang on ... and if Pettersen can find something up 18 ... if, if, if. We\u2019ll soon find out! Pettersen A/S Alex (17) 1 UP Law v McDonald (16) 4&amp;3 Nordqvist v Pressel (F) EUROPE 12\u00bd-13\u00bd USA Alex splits the 18th fairway. So much pressure now on Pettersen, who has to win this hole if Europe are to retain a chance of victory. But she sends a slice into the thick stuff on the right. Nothing\u2019s lost yet on the par-five, but the USA are in the box seat here. Pettersen and Alex both find 17. Both are faced with long birdie putts. Both nearly make them. Had Alex\u2019s dropped, the US would have retained the cup. But Europe survive. Pettersen and Alex will go up the last, with everything on the line! Pettersen A/S Alex (17) Law A/S McDonald (15) 4UP Nordqvist v Pressel (14) EUROPE 11\u00bd-13\u00bd USA Pettersen salvages a half on 16 with a lovely lagged putt from off the front of the green. And somehow on 15, McDonald lets Law off with her bunker slip, Europe escaping with a half there as well. Those could prove to be two crucial moments. Huge moments. Because if Pettersen and Law somehow scrap to victory in their matches, Europe can still pip the USA! Some big holes coming up right here, right now! Pettersen A/S Alex (16) Law A/S McDonald (15) 4UP Nordqvist v Pressel (14) EUROPE 11\u00bd-13\u00bd USA Salas, who made the winning putt two years ago, rolls an almost perfect right-to-left curler to a couple of inches. It\u2019s a par. That leaves Van Dam with a putt to halve the match. She gives it far too much on the high side, and the ball races off to the right. Salas secures her point, and the USA are so close now! She celebrates with her pals, while poor Van Dam dissolves in tears. van Dam v Salas 1 UP (F) Pettersen A/S Alex (16) Law A/S McDonald (15) 4UP Nordqvist v Pressel (14) EUROPE 11\u00bd-13\u00bd USA What a shot by Marina Alex! She whips her third at 16 to kick-in distance. The pressure\u2019s lumped on Suzann Pettersen. Back on 15, Bronte Law takes a couple of shots to get out of a greenside bunker. And up on 18, Salas knocks her third to 20 feet. Van Dam leaves herself an eight-foot birdie putt. It\u2019s one she\u2019ll need to make, because Europe\u2019s hopes are receding with great speed now. Back down the hole, Salas has driven into deep nonsense and can only take her medicine and hack out. Not the end of the world on this par-five, especially as she\u2019s a hole ahead. But the door is slightly ajar for Van Dam, and she blooters a lovely fairway wood up towards the green. She\u2019s just off the front in two. van Dam v Salas 1 UP (17) Pettersen A/S Alex (15) Law A/S McDonald (14) 4UP Nordqvist v Pressel (13) EUROPE 11\u00bd-12\u00bd USA It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to happen for them, though. On 18, Hull and Khang send their second shots into the swale to the front left of the large undulating green. Hull mishits her chip up, and remains down the bank. Khang however knocks hers to five feet, a quite wonderful shot. It\u2019s real carpe-diem stuff, and it forces Hull to race a wild putt up onto the green and down the swale on the other side. She isn\u2019t able to make the hail-mary par putt, and so the hole\u2019s lost and the match is halved. What a chip by Khang. It could be the shot that does for Europe!

She\u2019ll go up the last one down to Salas. Better news for Europe as Bronte Law levels up her match with Ally McDonald on 14. As things stand, the US will retain their trophy after a draw. Europe need something, and fast. 1 UP Hull v Khang (17) van Dam v Salas 1 UP (16) Pettersen A/S Alex (14) Law A/S McDonald (14) 4UP Nordqvist v Pressel (11) EUROPE 11-12 USA Van Dam manages to get her ball out of the trap, but can only thin it through the other side of the green. She\u2019ll have a long putt to scramble an unlikely par. But with Salas 12 feet or so away, this very much looks like the USA\u2019s hole. And back on 16, it\u2019s the USA\u2019s match, as Jessica Korda gets up and down from sand for birdie, while Caroline Masson\u2019s effort for birdie lips out. 1 UP Hull v Khang (17) van Dam A/S Salas (16) Masson v J Korda 3&amp;2 (F) Pettersen A/S Alex (14) Law v McDonald 1UP (12) 4UP Nordqvist v Pressel (11) EUROPE 11-12 USA Van Dam pulls her tee shot at 17, and her ball\u2019s plugged in the bank of a bunker. Right up against the lip. And she\u2019s got no stance. She\u2019ll do well to get that out, never mind close. The door\u2019s open for Salas, who deserves a little good fortune on these shores after her final-green heartbreak in the British Open at Woburn. She creams a delicious tee shot straight at the flag, and it\u2019s very much advantage America there. Neither Hull nor Khang make their birdie putts. Khang refuses to concede Hull\u2019s ten-inch par putt, which is poor form, even under these circumstances. Hull tidies up and they\u2019ll go down the last. Meanwhile Anne van Dam levels her match against Lizette Salas with birdie at 16, but it\u2019s one step forward, another back for Europe, as Marina Alex levels things up against Suzann Pettersen, the momentum in that match very much with the American now. 1 UP Hull v Khang (17) van Dam A/S Salas (16) Masson v J Korda 2UP (15) Pettersen A/S Alex (14) Law v McDonald 1UP (12) 4UP Nordqvist v Pressel (11) EUROPE 11-11 USA Hull ratchets up the pressure by firing a lovely iron straight at the 17th flag. But Khang isn\u2019t giving up yet, and responds with an equally delightful tee shot. Both will take a look at birdie from 12 feet or so.

It\u2019s pin high, 15 feet from the flag. A certain par ... and Azahara Munoz can\u2019t make the birdie she requires to extend the match. Munoz battled well to get back into contention, but too much damage was done early doors. Elsewhere, Jessica Korda moves two up on Caroline Masson, but it\u2019s a fine birdie for Charley Hull at 16, the reward for finding the back fringe of the par five in two, and she takes the lead over Megan Khang at a crucial juncture!

But not quite. She needed it, too, for the half. She\u2019s just one hole up on Marina Alex now. Better news for Europe in the final match, where Anna Nordqvist takes another hole off the hapless Morgan Pressel. It had been a long time coming. Brittany Altomare completes a 5&amp;4 rout over Jodi Ewart Shadoff by rolling in a 15-footer on 14. She\u2019s missed nothing with the flat stick today.

It was a stunning finish to the match, as the French star nearly chipped in from tight rough on 17, Park then an inch away from holing out from the sand! Both players so unlucky not to end on a high, though Boutier will care not a jot.

It steals the hole off Caroline Masson, who was looking at a 15-footer to win it herself. Spooked, Masson misses the putt, and she\u2019s two down.

Hall has a chance to wrap up the match, but can\u2019t do so, her birdie effort from similar distance dribbling past the left lip. She\u2019s dormie two.

She\u2019s not going to die wondering. But it drifts by on the right, ending a couple of feet past. She rather generously picks up Ciganda\u2019s marker - she could legitimately have seen the first putt, just in case her opponent froze - conceding the hole and the match. That\u2019s the first point on the board this afternoon ... and it\u2019s Europe\u2019s! 1UP Ciganda v Kang (F) Hedwall v N Korda 1UP (17) 2UP Hall v Thompson (15) 1UP Boutier v Park (14) Munoz v Yin 1UP (14) Hull A/S Khang (13) van Dam v Salas 1UP (13) Masson A/S J Korda (11) Ewart Shadoff v Altomare 4UP (11) 1UP Pettersen v Alex (9) Law A/S McDonald (8) 2UP Nordqvist v Pressel (8) EUROPE 9-8 USA Ciganda plays one of the shots of the week! She bumps her chip out of the filth hard, into the upslope of the swale. The slope takes the sting out of the ball, which trundles up onto the green and stops pin high, 20 feet or so from the flag. From where she was, that was quite outstanding! Kang swishes her second sand shot up and out, over a huge lip, and to ten feet. That was pretty special as well, a long relaxed swing that landed her ball delicately on the green. But she\u2019ll need to make this par putt. This is coming to a boil now! Megan Khang misses from eight feet on 13, and she\u2019s all square with Charley Hull. Angel Yin shoves a three footer wide right at 14, and her lead over Azahara Munoz, once four holes, is back down to just one. And drama on 18, as Kang flubs her sand shot, weakly sending it into another trap closer to the green. Advantage Ciganda? Well, maybe, but she\u2019s in tangled nonsense up the bank, with a swale between her ball and the green ... and little dancefloor to play with. A big moment here.

And when Lexi Thompson misses a short par putt, it\u2019s enough for the hole! She moves two clear at a crucial stage. On 17, Caroline Hedwall should level things up in the second match, after swishing a gorgeous tee shot pin high to ten feet, but she misreads the straightest putt at Gleneagles, giving it too much on the right, and Nelly Korda escapes with a par. And trouble for both players currently going up 18: after fine drives, Kang finds a greenside bunker with her second, while Ciganda flays her approach miles to the right. Tricky up and downs for both. Having reduced a four-hole deficit to one, Azahara Munoz undoes some of her good work with a tatty bogey at 13. She\u2019s two down to Angel Yin again. On 16, Caroline Hedwall teases a 30-foot birdie slider across the green and into the cup. You can hear the roar in Aviemore. She\u2019s just one down now, with two still to play. Meanwhile up on 17, Kang splashes out magnificently to ten feet, the best she could do having shortsided herself. And in goes the par saver! She\u2019s scrambled a half, because Ciganda\u2019s birdie putt never looks like dropping. Anna Nordqvist looks in control of the final match right now, by the way. She\u2019s moved three up after seven holes. Which way is this going to go? You wouldn\u2019t bet the farm, would you.

But Annie Park\u2019s short par putt on 13 horseshoes out, gifting the lead to the relentless Celine Boutier, while Jessica Korda\u2019s short missed effort on 10 allows Caroline Masson to tie up that match.

Having been three up at the turn, she\u2019s now two down. If nothing else, it proves to Ewart Shadoff that all is not yet lost. Although Azahara Munoz\u2019s antics should already be providing succour: she wins another hole, this time 12, to reduce her once-huge deficit against Angel Yin to one hole.

She smashes two huge shots down the par-five 16th to reach the green and set up a long eagle putt. However Kang puts a little pressure on by knocking her third - having laid up in front of the creek - to six feet. Let\u2019s see how this pans out, then. A couple of big putts coming up, sure to shape the afternoon narrative. Munoz continues to fight back! She wins a second hole in succession, stroking in a birdie putt on 11 from 20 feet. She\u2019s just two holes down against Angel Yin. But elsewhere, the momentum is very much with the USA! The Kordas continue to rise after stuttering starts. Nelly wins 13, Jessica wins 9, and the sisters are now leading their matches after being three and two holes down respectively. And a bogey for Anne van Dam on 10 means Lizette Salas is level. All of a sudden, with Ally McDonald levelling things up against Bronte Law on 6, this is the USA\u2019s to lose!

Meanwhile Brittany Altomare rakes in a long one on 8 to move two up on Jodi Ewart Shadoff, while Anna Nordqvist goes two up in the final match. It could well go down to that last rubber, because as things stand the scores will be level ... and the USA would retain the cup as holders. Best of luck guessing which way this is going to go.

Meanwhile on 14 Kang rolls in the six-footer she\u2019d left herself for birdie. Two putts for Ciganda, who birdies as well, but that\u2019ll feel like a win for Kang after their respective tee shots. And back on 6, Pettersen nervelessly guides in a left-to-right slider from 25 feet for birdie, moving two clear of Alex. Ice cold.

Suzann Pettersen moves one up on Marina Alex; Charley Hull misses another short chance to win a hole, this time at 8; Angel Yin hits the turn four ahead of Azahara Munoz; and Caroline Masson pulls a six-footer at 7 to hand a hole back to Jessica Korda.

She\u2019s disgusted with herself, but that\u2019s professionals for you, because she\u2019s still found the green. The weekend golfer would be thrilled. Birdie putt coming up. Some truly world-class play on the short par-four 11th. Kang sends her second screeching to 18 inches, a surefire thing for birdie. So Ciganda responds by knocking her ball to 12 inches! A pair of stunning birdies! Back on 6, Van Dam yips from short range to hand a hole back to Salas. And on 7, Hull creams a delicious iron to four feet, but shoves the birdie putt wide right.

Back on the tee, Hedwall and Nelly Korda, having been made to wait interminably, bash their drives down the middle. Lexi Thompson\u2019s putter sometimes lets her down over short distances. But she smoothly strokes a four-footer into the cup on 7 to remain two up on Georgia Hall. Meanwhile Brittany Altomare follows a bogey at 1 with birdie at 2. And some trouble for Carlota Ciganda on the par-five 9th, as she flays her drive into thick oomska down the right. There\u2019s no way she can go forward, as she\u2019d be flirting with water. Instead, she\u2019s forced to punch out sideways ... and she makes a real hash of it, failing to get her ball back on the fairway. She\u2019ll be hitting four into the green from distance. 1UP Ciganda v Kang (8) 3UP Hedwall v N Korda (8) Hall v Thompson 2UP (7) Boutier v Park 1UP (6) Munoz v Yin 3UP (5) Hull v Khang 2UP (4) 1UP van Dam v Salas (4) 1UP Masson v J Korda (2) Ewart Shadoff A/S Altomare (2) An aggressive chip by Ciganda, just off the back of 8, trundles a good 12 feet past the cup. But she nails the one coming back, salvaging her par and the half. She celebrates as though she made that for the win. It\u2019ll feel like that, Kang having shaved the hole with a birdie attempt. Back on 1, another triumph for Europe, who are finally getting to grips with this opening hole. Jodi Ewart Shadoff birdies to take the lead against Brittany Altomare. 1UP Ciganda v Kang (8) 3UP Hedwall v N Korda (7) Hall v Thompson 2UP (6) Boutier v Park 1UP (5) Munoz v Yin 3UP (4) Hull v Khang 2UP (3) 1UP van Dam v Salas (3) 1UP Masson v J Korda (2) 1UP Ewart Shadoff v Altomare (1) There\u2019s been a bit of chat about slow play this week. Ewan Murray has that story. Anyway, Carlota Ciganda and Danielle Kang have been told by the match referee to get a wriggle on. Meanwhile Yin wins yet another hole at 4, Munoz really struggling this afternoon. Hall bogeys 6 to gift a hole to Thompson; the 2018 British Open winner doesn\u2019t look totally happy with her game today either. But a hole back for Boutier at 5 as she halves her deficit against Park. 1UP Ciganda v Kang (7) 3UP Hedwall v N Korda (7) Hall v Thompson 2UP (6) Boutier v Park 1UP (5) Munoz v Yin 3UP (4) Hull v Khang 2UP (2) 1UP van Dam v Salas (1) 1UP Masson v J Korda (1) Danielle Kang makes the first bogey in the opening match, allowing Carlota Ciganda to put some blue on the board. Meanwhile Georgia Hall takes full advantage of her lucky break at 5, getting up and down to scramble her par and save the half. That\u2019s a staunch effort, and it\u2019s annoyed Lexi Thompson, who wanders off with a frown, wondering how that one\u2019s got away. 1UP Ciganda v Kang (7) 3UP Hedwall v N Korda (6) Hall v Thompson 1UP (5) Boutier v Park 2UP (4) Munoz v Yin 2UP (3) Hull v Khang 2UP (2) 1UP van Dam v Salas (1) 1UP Masson v J Korda (1) Caroline Hedwall is on fire this morning! Her feet slip as she takes her tee shot at the par-three 6th, but her ball takes a kindly kick off a bank to the right of the green, and trundles back towards the hole. She strokes in her birdie putt, and romps into a three-hole lead over Nelly Korda! Birdie for Caroline Masson at 1, and she takes the lead immediately against Jessica Korda. And another birdie for Angel Yin, this time at 3, and she\u2019s in control against Azahara Munoz already. She should really be three up. Ciganda A/S Kang (6) 3UP Hedwall v N Korda (6) Hall v Thompson 1UP (4) Boutier v Park 2UP (4) Munoz v Yin 2UP (3) Hull v Khang 2UP (2) 1UP van Dam v Salas (1) 1UP Masson v J Korda (1) Ciganda fizzes a fine tee shot at the par-three 6th straight at the flag. Five feet away. But she can\u2019t make the birdie putt, and a chance to take the lead in the opening match is spurned. Back on 5, Hall thinks she\u2019s sent her second into the hazard at the front of the green, but somehow her ball squeaks over. She\u2019s still up against it, though, with Thompson - her back having apparently repaired itself - on in regulation. Meanwhile on 1, Anne van Dam knocks her second to four feet, a wonderful shot that pressurises Lizette Salas into a bogey and a concession. A rare victory for Europe at this relatively easy opening hole. Ciganda A/S Kang (6) 2UP Hedwall v N Korda (5) Hall v Thompson 1UP (4) Boutier v Park 2UP (4) Munoz v Yin 1UP (2) Hull v Khang 2UP (2) 1UP van Dam v Salas (1) Birdie for Yin on 2, who doesn\u2019t miss a short one this time. Hall and Boutier both watch in horror as makeable hole-winning putts slide by on 4 and 3 respectively. And on 5, it\u2019s really not clear how birdie putts from Hedwall and Nelly Korda fail to drop. A couple of fine efforts teeter on the edge of the hole. Hedwall rather saucily picked up Korda\u2019s ball the second it stopped rolling, conceding the putt before gravity could pull any delayed stunt. Ciganda A/S Kang (5) 2UP Hedwall v N Korda (5) Hall v Thompson 1UP (4) Boutier v Park 2UP (3) Munoz v Yin 1UP (2) Hull v Khang 1UP (1) Ciganda nearly sends a fat approach into the water guarding the front of the tricky par-four 5th. She gets away with it, but follows that up with a heavy-handed chip, her ball scuttling ten feet past. No matter! When her putter\u2019s hot, it\u2019s red hot, and in goes the par saver. Kang, having parred the hole in much less dramatic fashion, will no doubt feel a tad robbed there. Meanwhile Charley Hull becomes Europe\u2019s latest victim on 1, as Megan Khang strokes a 20-foot birdie effort into the cup. The US are having the best of these early exchanges; they\u2019re up in three. Ciganda A/S Kang (5) 2UP Hedwall v N Korda (4) Hall v Thompson 1UP (3) Boutier v Park 2UP (2) Munoz A/S Yin (1) Hull v Khang 1UP (1) Lexi Thompson is by all accounts suffering from a trapped nerve in her back. Her caddie is having to tee up the ball for her. You wouldn\u2019t know by the way she creamed her second into 3, though. She\u2019s an inch or so away from making the birdie putt, but it stays stubbornly on the lip. And then some more pain for the American, as Georgia Hall channels her 2018 British Open winning form by rattling in a 20-footer to save par. Hall remains in touching distance. Ciganda A/S Kang (4) 2UP Hedwall v N Korda (4) Hall v Thompson 1UP (3) Boutier v Park 2UP (2) Munoz A/S Yin (1) Another gift for Europe! Following hot on the heels of Yin\u2019s short miss on 1, Nelly Korda shoves a tiddler right of the cup on the par-three 4th, and Hedwall restores her two-hole advantage. Ciganda A/S Kang (4) 2UP Hedwall v N Korda (4) Hall v Thompson 1UP (2) Boutier v Park 2UP (2) Munoz A/S Yin (1) The action - and the wind - is beginning to pick up now. Azahara Munoz and Angel Yin are out and about, the European one of the shorter hitters on tour, Yin one of the longest. Neither find the green in regulation. And like Boutier before her, Munoz can\u2019t wedge her ball up onto the green from the bottom of the swale to the left. She bumps her second attempt up to kick-in distance with a hybrid. Bogey\u2019s good enough, though, Yin failing to get up and down from the front fringe, missing a three-footer for her par. Meanwhile birdie for Park at 2, and she\u2019s off to a flyer against Boutier. Ciganda A/S Kang (4) 1UP Hedwall v N Korda (3) Hall v Thompson 1UP (2) Boutier v Park 2UP (2) Munoz A/S Yin (1) Ciganda looks to have made a holy mess of the par-three 4th, leaving her first putt well short. A terrible misjudgement. But she refuses to buckle, rolling in a ten-footer to save her par. Kang needs a six-footer to halve the hole, and she makes it. Ciganda A/S Kang (4) 1UP Hedwall v N Korda (3) Hall v Thompson 1UP (2) Boutier v Park 1UP (1) Thompson, having left herself with plenty to do from a greenside bunker at 2, gets up and down for a marvellous birdie. Such a good splash out to six feet, having shortsided herself. It salvages a half, Hall having found the green in two and taken two putts for a birdie of her own. Hedwall\u2019s fast start meanwhile comes to an abrupt end, as she yips a short one on 3 to hand the hole to Nelly Korda. Ciganda A/S Kang (3) 1UP Hedwall v N Korda (3) Hall v Thompson 1UP (2) Boutier v Park 1UP (1) Kang and Ciganda take turns to shave the right edge of the cup at 3, narrowly missing out on birdies. Hole halved. On 1, Boutier sends her second into the swale to the left of the green, then duffs two chips in succession, her ball landing apologetically on the upslope and coming back to her feet on both occasions. She thins a third attempt miles past the hole, and thank goodness this is isn\u2019t a stroke-play event. Ciganda A/S Kang (3) 2UP Hedwall v N Korda (2) Hall v Thompson 1UP (1) Boutier v Park 1UP (1) Another birdie for Caroline Hedwall! The 30-year-old Swede is the only player on either team to have featured in just one match so far this week, and she\u2019s flown out of the traps in the style of a woman with a point to prove. A textbook traverse up the par-five 2nd, and she pumps the air with her fist, wearing a look of extreme determination. What a start she\u2019s made! A force of nature in the Solheim Cup. Ciganda A/S Kang (2) 2UP Hedwall v N Korda (2) Hall v Thompson 1UP (1) The fourth match, between the rookies Annie Park and Celine Boutier, on the first tee. Park\u2019s drive takes a bounce into the semi-rough down the left ... as does Boutier\u2019s. Up on the green, Hall fails to get up and down from the front, having left her bump-and-run well short. Thompson tidies up for a par that takes the hole. Ciganda A/S Kang (2) 1UP Hedwall v N Korda (1) Hall v Thompson 1UP (1) Kang can\u2019t get up and down from the sand. That gives Ciganda an opportunity to win the hole, the Spaniard having chipped up to ten feet from the swale at the back of the green. She lines the putt up carefully, and rolls it straight into the cup. The opening match is all square! Back on the 1st, Thompson does extremely well to power out of the rough and find the dancefloor; Hall by comparison leaves her second short of the green from the middle of the fairway. Ciganda A/S Kang (2) 1UP Hedwall v N Korda (1) Lexi Thompson becomes the first player to miss the fairway with her opening drive. She sends a nervous effort into the thick stuff down the right. Her opponent Georgia Hall flirts with a bunker on the same side of the fairway, but gets a member\u2019s bounce and finds herself in prime position. Kang\u2019s second at the par-five 2nd is an inch away from perfection. But as it lands on the front of the green, instead of rolling towards the hole and setting up an eagle chance, the ball takes a huge kick left and into sand. That was nearly a stunner. Ciganda meanwhile sends her second over the back, setting up an up-and-down shoot-out. Meanwhile back on 1, Hedwall creams her second to six feet, and is soon punching the air as she rolls in an opening birdie to take an early lead against Nelly Korda. Ciganda v Kang 1UP (1) 1UP Hedwall v N Korda (1) Back on the tee, Nelly Korda whips her opening drive straight down the middle. Caroline Hedwall - five points in five matches in 2013 - follows her down. What an atmosphere on this first hole. The stands at the tee are packed, and a heavily populated gallery snakes all the way alongside the fairway. Hedwall\u2019s caddie gees the punters up with a wave of his arms, like they need any encouragement. Gleneagles is delivering again, just as it did at the 2014 Ryder Cup. Ciganda lags up. The putt\u2019s never going in, but it\u2019s perfectly paced and that\u2019s an opening par. Kang has a gentle right-to-left slider from eight feet for birdie and the hole. She walks it in, and it\u2019s first blood to the USA! Ciganda v Kang 1UP (1) Kang throws down the gauntlet immediately. She creams a short iron to eight feet. That\u2019s a sensational opening salvo. Ciganda\u2019s approach is mighty fine, but suffers by comparison, twice the distance out. Back on the tee, Caroline Hedwall, who went undefeated in the 2013 matches, turns up to do battle with Nelly Korda. Plenty of US support among the Scottish crowd. \u201cHere we go, Danielle, her we go!\u201d The American is up first. She tees it up high, and launches it down the middle, raising both arms in triumph. Always good to get that first drive away. Then it\u2019s Ciganda\u2019s turn. You can suddenly hear a pin drop. And the Spanish star sends a beauty down the middle. This is on! Here we go, indeed. Here we go, then! Carlota Ciganda, who has enjoyed a fine year in the majors with three top-ten finishes, takes to the first tee. An amazing party atmosphere. Ciganda\u2019s opponent, the 2017 PGA winner Danielle Kang, won\u2019t hear the music that\u2019s blaring out; she\u2019s in her own world with her ear buds in. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! Ochil aye. Before the action begins, here\u2019s a brief reminder of the road Europe and America\u2019s finest will traverse this afternoon. On Friday afternoon at Gleneagles, Europe looked poised to establish a healthy lead in the 16th Solheim Cup. But the USA, the pre-tournament favourites, ground out a couple of halves on the 18th. And then Saturday belonged to the visitors. So we go into the final day of this to-and-fro tournament all square. Eight points apiece. Have you buckled in? Because here we go! On paper, the USA should close this out and retain the cup they\u2019ve held since 2015. They\u2019ve got ten players in the world top 50, as opposed to Europe\u2019s six. And as holders they just need to reach 14 points to retain their trophy; Europe need 14.5 to snatch it back. But there\u2019s nothing quite like match-play singles, is there, and the USA have six rookies in their team. And they\u2019re significantly younger, with an average age of 25.5 compared to the hosts\u2019 28.2. These things shouldn\u2019t matter ... but it\u2019s the business end of the Solheim Cup, and you never know how it all comes down until everyone\u2019s out there on their own. It\u2019s been dramatic enough this week already. But of course here\u2019s where the story really begins. Can Juli Inkster\u2019s side keep a grip on the trophy the USA have won ten times already? Or will Catriona Matthew taste victory on home soil, bringing the cup back to Europe for the sixth time? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s on!

Smith was out for a paltry 23. Stokes was embraced; Root, who has been driven to distraction throughout this series by Smith, punched the air with abandon. Surely victory was around the corner now. And it was by 135 runs despite a defiant century from Matthew Wade.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/sep/15/ashes-2019-england-v-australia-fifth-test-day-four-live\">Ashes 2019: Australia chasing 399 to beat England, fifth Test day four \u2013 live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That mixture of relief and jubilation on this dismissal among the England players encapsulated the impact that Smith has had on this series, the 21st-century Bradman who was the foundation of every Australian innings. In fact Bradman had far more support from capable batsmen in the Thirties than Smith ever did in 2019. For all the efforts of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, two bowlers who are capable of joining the list of great Australian pacemen, Smith is the man that ensured the retention of the Ashes; it is remarkable that his 774 runs have not secured a series victory. And it was obvious that he should be the recipient of the Compton/Miller award for the man of the series, which is decided by the members of the press corps (it was almost a unanimous decision \u2013 there is always one).</p> \n<p>On this historic day of Smith failure Australia needed someone else to keep them afloat and it came in the form of Wade, the little battler from Tasmania, who is not noted for his reticence. They were set a target of 399 for victory after the remarkable sight of Broad cracking two short balls from Pat Cummins over the distant leg-side boundary early in the morning.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"54e8937e-700d-47a2-b61d-68d4f603553d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hDiUP6oedmY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Soon Broad was back in more familiar territory, running in from the Pavilion End and tormenting left-handed Australian batsmen. First he dismissed Marcus Harris, who has had a wretched three Tests, by knocking his off-stump out of the ground. Then he dispatched David Warner, who was neatly snaffled by Rory Burns at third slip.</p> \n<p>This was the seventh time in 10 knocks that Broad has dismissed Warner in this series, which is a record. Warner\u2019s total number of runs \u2013 95 \u2013 and his average \u2013 9.50 \u2013 are the lowest ever for an opener in a five-Test series. It is worse than the output of John D\u2019Arcy on New Zealand\u2019s 1958 tour of England. In fact the record speaks of Warner\u2019s high standing in the game since he retained his place throughout this torrid run. It is also remarkable that in one innings \u2013 at Headingley \u2013 Warner made 61, which can now be regarded as a false dawn.</p> \n<p>Marnus Labuschagne failed for the first time in the series when he fell victim to an alert stumping by Jonny Bairstow, who noticed that the batsman\u2019s right foot had crept out of the crease even though he was defending at the time. Even so, expect to see more of Labuschagne, who has done everything right in this series \u2013 except score a century. Then Smith departed and a swift conclusion was in prospect.</p> \n<p>Wade ensured this would not be the case. Wade is no more popular in the England dressing room than the speaker is in the Leadsom household but he batted with great skill and spirit. He took three consecutive fours off Jack Leach in an otherwise miserly spell from the left-armer and was never shackled, irrepressibly annoying his opponents yet exhibiting great touch along the way.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/15/summer-sport-2019-ashes-world-cup-cultural-war\">Farewell summer of sport 2019, you really were one for the ages | Sean Ingle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Mitchell Marsh, caught off a Chris Woakes no-ball early on, kept Wade company for 17 overs before being caught at short-leg off Root, who bowled some respectable off-breaks. Then came a captivating duel between Jofra Archer and Wade, teammates in Hobart in the Big Bash, though there was little sign of a deep and lasting friendship in their exchanges in the middle. Archer peppered Wade with bouncers, occasionally exceeding 96 mph in an eight-over spell. Wade dealt with the barrage well, ducking bouncers with fine judgment in between the odd boundary. Yet another full house lapped up this spectacle.</p> \n<p>Archer remained wicketless and Wade reached a deserved century, his fourth in Test cricket. But England kept picking up wickets before the situation became too serious; Leach trapped Tim Paine in front of his stumps; Cummins edged off Broad and Root had Wade stumped for a magnificent 117.</p> \n<p>Then suddenly it was all over courtesy of two fine catches from Root off the bowling of a grateful Leach. Nathan Lyon and Josh Hazlewood were caught in the ring from consecutive deliveries. Whereupon two exhausted teams shook hands after the first drawn Ashes series for 47 years. No matter the quality of the teams \u2013 there have been brilliant performances and dire ones throughout \u2013 there has seldom been a dull moment.</p>",

For all the efforts of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, two bowlers who are capable of joining the list of great Australian pacemen, Smith is the man that ensured the retention of the Ashes; it is remarkable that his 774 runs have not secured a series victory. And it was obvious that he should be the recipient of the Compton/Miller award for the man of the series, which is decided by the members of the press corps (it was almost a unanimous decision \u2013 there is always one). On this historic day of Smith failure Australia needed someone else to keep them afloat and it came in the form of Wade, the little battler from Tasmania, who is not noted for his reticence. They were set a target of 399 for victory after the remarkable sight of Broad cracking two short balls from Pat Cummins over the distant leg-side boundary early in the morning. Soon Broad was back in more familiar territory, running in from the Pavilion End and tormenting left-handed Australian batsmen. First he dismissed Marcus Harris, who has had a wretched three Tests, by knocking his off-stump out of the ground. Then he dispatched David Warner, who was neatly snaffled by Rory Burns at third slip. This was the seventh time in 10 knocks that Broad has dismissed Warner in this series, which is a record. Warner\u2019s total number of runs \u2013 95 \u2013 and his average \u2013 9.50 \u2013 are the lowest ever for an opener in a five-Test series. It is worse than the output of John D\u2019Arcy on New Zealand\u2019s 1958 tour of England. In fact the record speaks of Warner\u2019s high standing in the game since he retained his place throughout this torrid run. It is also remarkable that in one innings \u2013 at Headingley \u2013 Warner made 61, which can now be regarded as a false dawn. Marnus Labuschagne failed for the first time in the series when he fell victim to an alert stumping by Jonny Bairstow, who noticed that the batsman\u2019s right foot had crept out of the crease even though he was defending at the time. Even so, expect to see more of Labuschagne, who has done everything right in this series \u2013 except score a century. Then Smith departed and a swift conclusion was in prospect. Wade ensured this would not be the case. Wade is no more popular in the England dressing room than the speaker is in the Leadsom household but he batted with great skill and spirit. He took three consecutive fours off Jack Leach in an otherwise miserly spell from the left-armer and was never shackled, irrepressibly annoying his opponents yet exhibiting great touch along the way. Mitchell Marsh, caught off a Chris Woakes no-ball early on, kept Wade company for 17 overs before being caught at short-leg off Root, who bowled some respectable off-breaks. Then came a captivating duel between Jofra Archer and Wade, teammates in Hobart in the Big Bash, though there was little sign of a deep and lasting friendship in their exchanges in the middle. Archer peppered Wade with bouncers, occasionally exceeding 96 mph in an eight-over spell. Wade dealt with the barrage well, ducking bouncers with fine judgment in between the odd boundary. Yet another full house lapped up this spectacle. Archer remained wicketless and Wade reached a deserved century, his fourth in Test cricket. But England kept picking up wickets before the situation became too serious; Leach trapped Tim Paine in front of his stumps; Cummins edged off Broad and Root had Wade stumped for a magnificent 117. Then suddenly it was all over courtesy of two fine catches from Root off the bowling of a grateful Leach. Nathan Lyon and Josh Hazlewood were caught in the ring from consecutive deliveries. Whereupon two exhausted teams shook hands after the first drawn Ashes series for 47 years. No matter the quality of the teams \u2013 there have been brilliant performances and dire ones throughout \u2013 there has seldom been a dull moment.",

      "bodyText": "Peaky Blinders is among the most-watched dramas on television and has grown into a cultural phenomenon around the world thanks to Netflix viewers. Now the Birmingham-based gangsters are going about conquering the festival world. The two-day Legitimate Peaky Blinders festival took place this weekend in Digbeth, the area of the city centre closely associated with the historical gang, with performances from Primal Scream, Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes, Anna Calvi and Liam Gallagher. Billed by organisers as an \u201cimmersive re-creation of the Peaky Blinders world\u201d, other activities included staged bare-knuckle fights, a Gypsy enclosure with painted caravans, swing bands, a cast Q&amp;A featuring Sam Neill (Major Campbell), Paul Anderson (Arthur Shelby) and Kate Phillips (Linda Shelby), a fashion show for the official Peaky Blinders tailoring line, Garrison Tailors, free haircuts and a company of actors walking around in character. A majority of those in attendance wore newsboy caps, some going the extra few miles with an entire outfit of period-correct attire. There were hundreds of flappers and women in cocktail dresses, while other women opted for a more androgynous look, nodding to the Shelby clan\u2019s queen, Polly (Helen McCrory). Sitting about 50 yards from the site of the first recorded Peaky Blinders crime \u2013 an assault of March 1890, some 30 years before the events depicted in the series \u2013 the show\u2019s creator, Steven Knight, said it was like a \u201cbizarre dream\u201d to see fans sporting severe French crops and flat caps, starched collars and braces inspired by his series. \u201cIt\u2019s very humbling,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are intelligent human beings who have decided to use their free time to show their love for the series. I see lots of people with tattoos, or decorating their cars and vans. It\u2019s working-class people, it\u2019s middle-class people, and they have responded on an extraordinary level.\u201d It is the latest development for the brand that is credited with fuelling a surge in tourism to Birmingham and the rest of the West Midlands. Having boosted visitor numbers to the city to a record 43 million last year \u2013 a 26% increase since 2013 when the series was first broadcast \u2013 Peaky Blinders prompts much pride in the region. \u201cIt really shows off the area and it can only be a good thing that so many people are visiting,\u201d says Ellie Bloomfield, who has travelled from nearby Wolverhampton to attend \u2013 in full 1920s outfit \u2013 with her partner, Joel Tett. \u201cWe know the names of the places and have heard about the events,\u201d says Tett. \u201cMy grandad used to drink in the real-life Garrison [the pub owned by the Shelby family in the series]. He loves the show and can really relate to it. He recognises a lot of what was going on at the time.\u201d Wayne Morris and Jenny Gill were another local couple attending in full Peaky get-up. \u201cThe local association is really important for us,\u201d said Morris. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s part of our heritage. We didn\u2019t know anything about that era before the series started. As for the outfits, we only wear these clothes for special occasions, but I\u2019d dress like this every day if it was more acceptable.\u201d \u201cWe toyed with doing this in London,\u201d says promoter John Empson, who worked with Knight, the immersive theatre group Dank Parish and Martin Coat, the creative mind behind Boomtown festival, to stage the Peaky weekender. \u201cThat felt like a diss to Birmingham. Peaky Blinders has been a massive boost for the city and people here hold it close to their hearts. It had to be here.\u201d In light of the pilgrimage, there is a certain irony to the fact much of the series is filmed in Manchester and Liverpool, but that isn\u2019t going to deter either the organisers or the devoted Peaky fans. The festival was some way off selling out of its 20,000 tickets, perhaps understandable given the short lead time \u2013 it was only announced in late July. \u201cUltimately, this is a new way of staging a festival, with these immersive aspects,\u201d says Empson. \u201cBoomtown is the best at this kind of thing, they do it so well, and we can learn. It took longer for people to connect with this idea than I thought it would, to be honest. I thought this weekend was going to sell out overnight, but no festival sells out its first year. We will be back next year \u2013 we have a long-term plan for more festivals, and in different locations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Nearly 50 years ago, in 1972, a phone call alerted me to a demonstration at the Covent Garden opera house in London. Would I write it up in the paper? It was a matinee and a throng of starry-eyed teenagers were waiting at the stage door for the dancer Margot Fonteyn. As she appeared, and to general dismay, banners shot up, urging Don\u2019t Dance to the Apartheid Tune. The Hain family \u2013 Adelaine and Walter, and a couple of their children \u2013 were telling the much-loved prima ballerina how unwise it would be to do Sleeping Beauty before segregated audiences in Cape Town. Fonteyn went anyway, but the Hains, who had been forced out of South Africa when life became impossible for them, had made another inroad in the British consciousness. Two years earlier, their son Peter had spearheaded a direct action campaign against the touring Springbok rugby team that led to the exclusion of South Africa from world sport.

I\u2019ve felt shame and keeping such a big secret has taken its toll.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was in a dark place, feeling suicidal. I thought about driving off a cliff.

We did a survey which found 50% of people would not want to date somebody who is living with HIV even though there is no risk of transmission<strong>. </strong>Gareth\u2019s disclosure, his decision to tell his story, is huge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Thomas made the revelation ahead of competing in one of the world\u2019s toughest Ironman challenges, one that involves swimming 2.4 miles in Carmarthen Bay, cycling 112 miles through Pembrokeshire national park and running a full marathon in and around the seaside town of Tenby. He finished the event in 12 hours, 18 minutes and 29 seconds, coming 413th out of 2,039 participants.</p> \n<p>Green was there on Sunday to cheer Thomas on. \u201cHe started at 7am.

I have to be strong. I have to be at the end of it a completely different person to the person I am now.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think what I want to learn more than anything \u2026 is that, I\u2019ve got HIV and it\u2019s OK, like. That\u2019s what I want to learn more than anything.\u201d</p> \n<p>The documentary will tell how blackmailers forced him to go public.

W.\u201d Thomas, who on Sunday completed a 140.6-mile Ironman triathlon, has gone public after blackmailers threatened to reveal his secret and tabloid journalists went to the house of his parents. He told the Sunday Mirror: \u201cI\u2019ve been living with this secret for years. I\u2019ve felt shame and keeping such a big secret has taken its toll. \u201cI was in a dark place, feeling suicidal. I thought about driving off a cliff. To me, wanting to die was just a natural thought and felt like the easier way out, but you have to confront things.\u201d Thomas, 45, said he \u201cbroke down\u201d when he got the news of his diagnosis. \u201cWhen [the doctor] said those words ... I immediately thought I was going to die. I felt like an express train was hitting me at 300mph. Then I was thinking \u2018how long have I got left?\u201d\u2019 Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said medical advances meant that someone effectively treated for HIV can have a normal life expectancy and cannot pass the virus on to their partner. \u201cThat has all changed but what hasn\u2019t changed is the stigma,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cFor Gareth to talk openly about living with HIV is going to have a massive impact in tackling the stigma that still exists, but also to normalise HIV as just a standard long-term medical condition that people can live a normal life with.\u201d Green, who has lived with HIV himself for 23 years, said the stigma existed in many different ways and settings. \u201cThere are still people who face stigma in healthcare when they go and see their doctor or dentist. \u201cPeople face it in relationships. We did a survey which found 50% of people would not want to date somebody who is living with HIV even though there is no risk of transmission. Gareth\u2019s disclosure, his decision to tell his story, is huge.\u201d Thomas made the revelation ahead of competing in one of the world\u2019s toughest Ironman challenges, one that involves swimming 2.4 miles in Carmarthen Bay, cycling 112 miles through Pembrokeshire national park and running a full marathon in and around the seaside town of Tenby. He finished the event in 12 hours, 18 minutes and 29 seconds, coming 413th out of 2,039 participants. Green was there on Sunday to cheer Thomas on. \u201cHe started at 7am. He told me that he hopes to finish in daylight, which will be about 7pm this evening. Before he started this he couldn\u2019t swim \u2026 he is an extraordinary man.\u201d Thomas, nicknamed Alfie, came out as gay in 2009 and remains one of the few professional team sportspeople to have done so. He approached the Trust six months ago asking it to take part in a BBC Wales documentary which is due to be screened on Wednesday. \u201cWe have become really good friends,\u201d said Green. \u201cI hope I\u2019ve been there to support him in what has been quite an emotional time for him, but one that he has coped with remarkably well. \u201cGareth really is passionate about making a difference \u2026 he sees it as a long-term commitment to eradicating HIV stigma, it is an absolute passion. We are very lucky to have someone like Gareth advocating for people living with HIV.\u201d Thomas explains his motivation in a short, powerful clip from the documentary. Trying to hold back tears, his voice breaking, Thomas said: \u201cThe reason I\u2019m doing this is because firstly I want to remember what it\u2019s like to live again. \u201cI want to remember what it\u2019s like to feel free. And by doing that \u2026 I want to empower so many other people who are in exactly the same position as me, and probably ten times worse, to be able to feel free as well. \u201cAnd to do that I have to educate myself. I have to be strong. I have to be at the end of it a completely different person to the person I am now. \u201cI think what I want to learn more than anything \u2026 is that, I\u2019ve got HIV and it\u2019s OK, like. That\u2019s what I want to learn more than anything.\u201d The documentary will tell how blackmailers forced him to go public. At one point he had to consult lawyers after a tabloid newspaper found out about his HIV status and journalists went to his parents\u2019 home. Thomas posted a confessional video on Twitter in which he talks about it being his secret to reveal, \u201cnot the evils that made my life hell, threatening to tell you before I do. \u201cEven though I have been forced to tell you this, I choose to fight, to educate and break the stigma around this subject.\u201d Thomas, who will be a pundit for ITV in the upcoming rugby world cup, also reveals that he married his husband Stephen three years ago.

      "body": "<p>Fiona Harvey is surely right when she says \u201cadaptation alone won\u2019t save us from climate disaster\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/11/adaptaion-climate-disaster-cutting-emissions\" title=\"\">Journal</a>, 12 September). She gives an apt metaphor that adaptation \u201cwhile continuing to burn fossil fuels is like trying to mop up an overflowing sink while the taps are still running\u201d, but she still talks of mechanisms for \u201cbetter economic growth\u201d.</p> <p>Political leaders worldwide need to recognise the causal connection between economic growth and global heating, manifest in fossil fuel consumption. To save the planet, fossil fuels need to stay underground \u2013 unused by the greed of humankind. Our energy must come from wind, wave, hydraulic and solar sources, but this will be insufficient to maintain many of our industries and, consequently, many jobs will be lost.</p> <p>Societies need to adapt so that acquisitive individualism is replaced by cooperative community life. Partly self-sustaining communities need to be created where home workers (ie, non-wage workers) can find worthwhile activity in home care, environment care, vegetable gardens, allotments, orchards, community social activities and other unpaid pursuits. To alleviate the potential poverty of those losing jobs, universal citizen\u2019s income will be needed \u2013 recovered in taxation from those in wage-paying work.</p> <p>Come the next general election, would-be MPs should tell us how they propose to tackle climate change and how they intend to engage in worldwide discussion of necessary measures.<br><strong>Michael Bassey</strong><br><em>Newark, Nottinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Does Fiona Harvey go far enough in her judgment that emissions reduction, adaptation and coastal protection constitute the main \u201ctools in the box\u201d for averting such a disaster? An analysis of the stress exerted on our climate and ocean system by the growing excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere suggests an aim which is fundamentally more appropriate: the retrieval of this overload, with the goal of returning carbon dioxide\u2019s concentration to its stable and pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million, from the present, and growing, 408ppm. Ultimately, taking care of the stressor would take care of the raised temperatures which we so rightly fear. Such a policy would demand a great deal of money, more perhaps than the public and financial institutions are currently willing to part with. And it would necessitate the worldwide adoption of technologies in which fossil fuels would no longer play a part.</p> <p>These technologies are known to many, and are already developing fast. We need to displace fossil fuels and embrace all that solar energy has to offer in the forms of electricity, heat and hydrogen derived from solar-electrolysed water. And we need to develop forms of enhanced photosynthetic growth, in expanding forests and in harvesting specially planted grasses, ensuring that the carbon thus embedded in their tissues is never returned to the atmosphere.<br><strong>Mike Koefman</strong><br><em>Director, Planet Hydrogen, Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Fiona Harvey stated two profound truths.

      "bodyText": "Fiona Harvey is surely right when she says \u201cadaptation alone won\u2019t save us from climate disaster\u201d (Journal, 12 September). She gives an apt metaphor that adaptation \u201cwhile continuing to burn fossil fuels is like trying to mop up an overflowing sink while the taps are still running\u201d, but she still talks of mechanisms for \u201cbetter economic growth\u201d. Political leaders worldwide need to recognise the causal connection between economic growth and global heating, manifest in fossil fuel consumption. To save the planet, fossil fuels need to stay underground \u2013 unused by the greed of humankind. Our energy must come from wind, wave, hydraulic and solar sources, but this will be insufficient to maintain many of our industries and, consequently, many jobs will be lost. Societies need to adapt so that acquisitive individualism is replaced by cooperative community life. Partly self-sustaining communities need to be created where home workers (ie, non-wage workers) can find worthwhile activity in home care, environment care, vegetable gardens, allotments, orchards, community social activities and other unpaid pursuits. To alleviate the potential poverty of those losing jobs, universal citizen\u2019s income will be needed \u2013 recovered in taxation from those in wage-paying work. Come the next general election, would-be MPs should tell us how they propose to tackle climate change and how they intend to engage in worldwide discussion of necessary measures. Michael Bassey Newark, Nottinghamshire \u2022 Does Fiona Harvey go far enough in her judgment that emissions reduction, adaptation and coastal protection constitute the main \u201ctools in the box\u201d for averting such a disaster? An analysis of the stress exerted on our climate and ocean system by the growing excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere suggests an aim which is fundamentally more appropriate: the retrieval of this overload, with the goal of returning carbon dioxide\u2019s concentration to its stable and pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million, from the present, and growing, 408ppm. Ultimately, taking care of the stressor would take care of the raised temperatures which we so rightly fear. Such a policy would demand a great deal of money, more perhaps than the public and financial institutions are currently willing to part with. And it would necessitate the worldwide adoption of technologies in which fossil fuels would no longer play a part. These technologies are known to many, and are already developing fast. We need to displace fossil fuels and embrace all that solar energy has to offer in the forms of electricity, heat and hydrogen derived from solar-electrolysed water. And we need to develop forms of enhanced photosynthetic growth, in expanding forests and in harvesting specially planted grasses, ensuring that the carbon thus embedded in their tissues is never returned to the atmosphere. Mike Koefman Director, Planet Hydrogen, Manchester \u2022 Fiona Harvey stated two profound truths. The first in the title; the second in the words: \u201cAs long as we continue to pump CO2 into the air, we are fuelling rises in temperature.\u201d But it is the second truth that identifies the fundamental solution \u2013 to pump CO2 out of the air faster than the rate at which it is being pumped in. This is known as greenhouse gas removal, the subject of a 2018 report from the Royal Society, in which we read that \u201creducing emissions is not enough \u2013 we must also actively remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere\u201d. So perhaps Fiona Harvey should be less dismissive of geoengineering. Funding a major project to develop large-scale ways to extract greenhouse gases from the atmosphere will save the planet. Dennis Sherwood Rutland, East Midlands \u2022 Fiona Harvey says: \u201cMelting permafrost releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than CO2.\u201d While the levels of methane gas should certainly be reduced, that phrase demonises methane over CO2. According to Simon Fairlie in his Meat: A Benign Extravagance, methane doesn\u2019t stay in the atmosphere for longer than 12 years, while the same value of CO2 has its effect spread out over two centuries. By demonising methane, it will be more likely that rural communities whose modest lifestyles include a few ruminants and timber-fuelled sources of energy would be penalised over industrial-scale CO2 producers and users. This would be patently unfair. Ann Spencer Harefield, Middlesex \u2022 Fiona Harvey is absolutely right that there is going to be no wall high enough to keep out the consequences of inaction on greenhouse gas emissions.

Young children do not learn in a simplistic linear way, rather through a complex network of rich interconnecting influences which only a well-designed nursery, with a rich well-structured curriculum, offers. An important long-term study around the benefits of good-quality early years, by Schweinhart and Weikart undertaken in the US over 20 years, found that for every dollar invested in the pre-school programme, the return to society was fourfold. The research found that 20% fewer who participated were arrested for criminal acts, 14% fewer were arrested for crimes involving property or violence, etc. It\u2019s not a reboot we need, just a resumption of Sure Start, which has been so wantonly vandalised. Mark Dudek Author of Kindergarten Architecture, London \u2022 As your editorial suggests, the Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner\u2019s manifesto is to be welcomed. The six core points, if implemented, have the potential to improve the lives of the specific groups of children and families in need outlined. However, what would improve the lives of all children and young people \u2013 and should be identified as the foundation stones for political change \u2013 are, first a comprehensive programme to reduce inequality in its many forms, and second, policies to improve the active participation and involvement of children and young people in all the institutions which shape their lives. The right to vote at 16 would be a good start.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining and especially for any New York tips. Here is is Ben Fisher\u2019s match report: Alternatively, join Rob Smyth for Watford v Arsenal Amuse yourself with Jonathan Wilson while we wait for Ben Fisher\u2019s report ... Souness is not a fan of Everton\u2019s defending. Cahill a bit more diplomatic in the studio. Callum Wilson says: \u201cWe needed to get back to winning games at home. Winning games at home is the most important thing.\u201d Ryan Fraser says Eddie Howe told him to prove why he should be starting the next game. He has proved that. \u201cHello Mr Howe, I\u2019ll take a three-year deal, please.\u201d Calvert-Lewin scored but I think Kean needs to be given more chances as he looks the more dynamic player. Calvert-Lewin is very much a \u2018can do a job\u2019 striker but if Everton really want to start looking up the table, they need someone more prolific and Kean could be that man. When Kean and Bernard came on it did seem like Everton were playing quicker. Bournemouth took their chances and that was the difference, to be honest. Everton let two set-pieces and a long ball over the top end up in the back of the net, while failing to create much down the other end. 90+2 mins: Mina seemingly hates Pickford, he plays a short backpass to the goalkeeper, who realises it\u2019s a terrible pass and leaps out to clear the ball before Wilson can nip in for his hat-trick. Pickford then gives Mina the look of a primary school teacher to a pupil who has just poured his milk on the floor. 89 mins: Bernard cuts and drifts past Lerma, whacks a shot which is deflected up into the air, resulting in Billing and Iwobi battling for the loose ball at the back post. The challenge leaves them both on the floor but both just about get up. Five minutes added on. 87 mins: I actually think this game has been quite even but Bournemouth have just made the most of their time in the final third, aided by some poor defending. Everton have been limited to half-chances and little else. 85 mins: Michael Keane decides the best idea is to lift a long, high backpass to Pickford from about 40 yards away is a good idea. It is not and bounces out for a corner. Keane would be a good defender if he could pass or keep his position. 83 mins: Can Everton salvage anything from this? Kean indicates they won\u2019t by crossing the ball into Ramsdale\u2019s hands. 81 mins: Everton should be back in this game but first Iwobi\u2019s effort from 17 yards is repelled by Ramsdale into Richarlison\u2019s path but the Brazilian messes everything up and whacks it wide. He is rightly punished by being replaced with Theo Walcott. Justin Kavanagh emails: \u201cSurely a club paying wages in the tens of thousands (per week) have the right to demand that players become two-footed? Delph\u2019s dreadful inability to use his right foot is comparable to a goalkeeper only using one hand going up for crosses.\u201d Rather than demand, they could just train them. 79 mins: Jack Stacey, making his Premier League debut, has gone down with cramp after tackling Bernard. He is finding out what the Premier League is all about today. 77 mins: I watch a lot of live football but have never wanted to buy a TagHeuer watch. Maybe their sponsorship plan is not working. Lerma replaces Lewis Cook who has shown what he adds to Bournemouth. The midfielder has missed nine months of football and will be very happy to be back. 75 mins: Everton have conceded from two set-pieces and a long ball over the top today, which is a bit of a worry looking to win the Everton Trophy this season by finishing seventh. The Everton defence is awful. Lewis Cook lifts the ball over the centre-backs who turn like the Titanic, allowing Wilson to nip in ahead of them and calmly lift the ball over Pickford who calm a long way out of his goal. 71 mins: Bernard and Kean are on for Everton, which is not much of a surprise after Bournemouth took the lead. Calvert-Lewin and Sigurdsson make way. 69 mins: Fraser is having fun here. This time he dinks a ball into Wilson, who takes it onto his chest but then can\u2019t get his shot away in time and the ball is cleared for a corner. Fraser takes a dreadful, low free-kick from the left wing, which beats Delph at the front post who makes a laughable attempt to clear it with his wrong foot. The ball deceives everyone and lands in the bottom corner. 66 mins: Steve Cook beats Calvert-Lewin to a through ball but then plays a pitifully weak backpass to Ramsdale, which the striker gets to first but the goalkeeper does well to stop his jab and Cook recovers to remove the remnants of danger. Down the other end, King springs away from everyone down the left until Richarlison almost catches up and cynically downs in to take the Bournemouth forward down 20 yards from goal. Needless to say, Richarlison was booked. 64 mins: Richard McGahey points out: \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t VAR, it\u2019s Premier League refereeing. Much more physical play is allowed on a consistent basis, tackling opponents in the penalty area, kicking them in the head with high boots, never calling persistent infringement for a cynical team policy of fouling, commentators admiring Sean Dyche, etc. VAR can\u2019t correct for this playing and reffing culture.\u201d 62 mins: The Everton fans shout for a handball after the ball hits Fraser\u2019s shoulder in his own area. It goes to VAR and comes to nothing. Steve Cook is down in the box with a knee issue, so he might struggle to carry on. 60 mins: Bournemouth try to pass the ball out from the back despite one of their centre backs being on his haunches. Bit of an odd move which ends with Everton winning a throw-in. Digne wins a corner after his dangerous cross is turned behind by Fraser. 58 mins: I very rarely get things right, so Eddie Howe replacing Harry Wilson with Ryan Fraser, as I suggested, has cheered me greatly. Fraser\u2019s first involvement is to intercept a stray Delph pass, forcing Digne to bring him down, earning a yellow for his troubles. 56 mins: Digne seems to be struggling with some sort of injury, not that I can work out what it is. Mina does well to intercept a ball over the top but then just runs it out of play for a corner. 54 mins: Sigurdsson looks to instigate a counter-attack with a ball down the channel but thinks he is playing for Wimbledon circa 1993 and just whacks it the entire length of the pitch so even Ben Johnson at peak drug taking couldn\u2019t catch. 52 mins: There\u2019s plenty of back and forth here but someone really needs to take hold of this game in midfield. 50 mins: A missed a few moments retrieving a pastel de nata from my bag. Luckily, nothing happened. 47 mins: Digne and Iwobi combine well on the left-hand side of the box, allowing the former to cut it back for Sigurdsson who does his best to divert a strong pass at goal and Ramsdale tips over. Here we go again! JR says: \u201cThe reason Calvert-Lewin has so high above Cook was because he had both hands on Cook\u2019s shoulders and held him down at the same time as he used him to push himself up. You\u2019d maybe expect VAR would have something to say about that. Of course you\u2019d have to believe the people in charge of using VAR know what the hell they\u2019re doing, which I don\u2019t. It\u2019s an epic shambles so far. \u201c(And I\u2019m not saying I necessarily want every little niggly foul looked back on or every eyelash offside looked and again and called but if they\u2019re going to use VAR there needs to be some consistency in how it\u2019s used and right now there is absolutely none.)\u201c Also ... if anyone wants to email in New York recommendations to me, please do. Any early changes required? I would consider Davies for Schneiderlin and Fraser for Harry Wilson. Prolific! Mary Waltz offers: \u201cEverton finally shows some quality in the box. They have the talent to do so much better but on the road it so rarely appears.\u201d It\u2019s been a game with plenty of action but minimal quality in the final third. A draw is fair enough at this stage. Richarlison makes a run out to the right wing, and lifts a cross onto the head of Calvert-Lewin, who leaps a lot higher than Steve Cook and heads beyond Ramsdale from six yards out. 42 mins: Ake spins in the box and hits a relatively tame shot towards goal which Solanke gets in the way of and diverts wide. 40 mins: A yellow card for Delph as he cleans out Wilson with a very high boot. It could have been worse if he caught more of the man but the VAR check says it is not worthy of a dismissal. 38 mins: Digne gets round the outside of the Bournemouth defence, before crossing into the box for Richarlison to direct a header from six yards out but Rico does enough to put him off and it calmly drops wide. 36 mins: Steve Cook launches a long throw into the box but it\u2019s high and looping, allowing Everton to head clear. The ball eventually reaches Calvert-Lewin but he is dispossessed as he tries to turn. Not really happening for Calvert-Lewin today. 34 mins: Schneiderlin just seems to be slowing everything down for Everton, which is a shame due to what they have in the final third. Maybe Tom Davies should be brought on to provide some energy in there. 32 mins: Another free-kick for Harry Wilson. This time, from a very similar position to early, he only achieves hitting the wall. 30 mins: Delph stops the counter-attack with a sliding challenge on Callum Wilson who stays down for too long for the liking of Bournemouth due to his injury record but he eventually gets to his feet and looks OK. Coleman then nudges King over. Sean Coffey claims via email : \u201cThe VAR delay was for suspected offside - which it seemed to be - not for handball. Surprised the goal was given tbh...\u201d Was it? They didn\u2019t seem to get the tramlines out and it definitely wasn\u2019t offside. Maybe I am too tired. 28 mins: Coleman drives in a low cross but Calvert-Lewin, under pressure from Steve Cook, can only turn the ball behind for a goal-kick. 26 mins: Solanke has looked a little rusty in the opening spell but has also shown what he provides the team with some great aerial work for the goal and his ability to find space that allowed him to get off a rasping drive. Bournemouth win the first header at the front post, which is flicked to the back, where King should convert but instead he lifts the ball back into the danger area off his thigh and Callum Wilson heads it home from six yards out. VAR have a look for some reason or other ... a potential handball by King, which no one else has seen. Goal given. What a waste of time. 22 mins: Pickford is alert when Solanke finds space on the edge of the are and hits a rising drive which is calmly tipped over by the goalkeeper. 20 mins: Both goalkeepers are trying to pass the ball out from the back and are taking risks. Ramsdale the latest to put a defender under pressure with a pass out to Stacey. 18 mins: Richarlison dissects the Bournemouth defence with a lovely pass but it just has a little too much on it and Calvert-Lewin\u2019s toe poke is smothered by an onrushing Ramsdale. Richarlison does not bother with passing a moment later, cutting in from the left and thwacking a shot from 25 yards which whacks off the top of the crossbar. 16 mins: Both teams are getting a good amount of possession in the final third but are yet to find that necessary cutting edge. Callum Wilson tries to stop Yerry Mina seeing the ball out of play for a goal-kick but only succeeds in pushing him over for a free-kick. 14 mins: Said free-kick is not Wilson\u2019s best and bounces around five yards in front of Pickford who gleefully takes hold of it. 12 mins: Schneiderlin holds up Lewis Cook but then clips his heels, gifting a free-kick to Harry Wilson 25 yards from goal. 10 mins: A straight free-kick from Bournemouth is headed straight up into the air, allowing Solanke to position himself for an overhead kick but his attempt is truly pathetic as he just about makes contact and the ball trickles in the opposite direction to the net. 8 mins: Bournemouth show what they have in their armoury as Lewis Cook clips a pass out to King, who cuts in, Billing then takes it off the striker\u2019s feet and curls a shot just wide from 20 yards. 6 mins: Sigurdsson is allowed to dribble from the middle of the pitch to out wide and put in a dangerous cross which Ramsdale is forced to tip over. Digne\u2019s corner is headed clear but Iwobi is allowed to send in a second cross for Ake to flick behind. The referee then blows for an infringement. 4 mins: Iwobi has a first-time shot from the edge of the area after Everton\u2019s high press wins the ball back in the final third. Iwobi\u2019s effort is deflected wide but it is a great sign of intent from the visitors. 2 mins: A quiet start in the sun. Cenk Tosun misses out for Everton this week, despite a scoring in midweek for Turkey. Jonathan Wilson was praising him on Football Weekly recently but he just does not seem to give Marco Silva such a feeling. Peep! Peep! Peep! Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! The teams are on the pitch, so we\u2019re closing in on kick-off, which is fantastic news. Why are playing warming up in long sleeves? It\u2019s bloody roasting. Maybe they hope to feel the benefit at the kickoff sooner or later. I have the TV on mute as Souness is talking but he is probably just pointing out why Moise Kean is on the bench. Callum and Harry Wilson are being interviewed on the beach on Sky Sports. It looks absolutely lovely down there. One day I will go to Dean Court and the beach. Not today, as today I am sat in an incredibly warm office. We have some correspondence from the delightful Gary Naylor ... Speaking of Wilsons, here is our very own Jonathan on the Champions League and why it is rubbish (until February). The prospect of Bournemouth starting with two Cooks and two Wilsons is not a positive for this MBMer. I will inevitably spending the afternoon confusing them and forgetting to include their first names in all correspondence, which is unfortunate. Bournemouth are looking pretty ruddy attacking in their makeup today. The two Wilsons start, with King and Solanke, too, so it should be a game full of forward-thinking play. Everton also have an exciting front four in the form of Sigurdsson, Iwobi, Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison. If there are not 12 goals in this match today, I will eat my hat or, at least, a hat shaped cake. This is not the only show in town today, as the Libs Dems are hosting their party conference in Bournemouth. There plenty of new signings still looking to bed themselves into the team, with their leader eyeing European progress, so the similarities are endless (two). Bournemouth: Ramsdale, S Cook, Ake, Rico, Stacey, Billing, L Cook, H Wilson, King, Solanke, C Wilson Subs: Boruc, Simpson, Lerma, Ibe, Fraser, Surman, Mepham Everton: Pickford, Coleman, Keane, Mina, Digne, Delph, Schneiderlin, Richarlison, Sigurdsson, Iwobi, Calvert-Lewin Subs: Stekelenburg, Holgate, Walcott, Sidibe, Bernard, Davies, Kean Good afternoon! It\u2019s a lovely day for football on the south coast and we are all anticipating an interesting game. Bournemouth are yet to kick into gear this season, picking up just one win and five goals in their opening four games. In order to help the team find the target, Eddie Howe took the players clay pigeon shooting this week. Hopefully the prospect and killing poor, innocent clay birds will be just the thing to assist Callum Wilson et al find the bottom corner today. Everton will go third if they win today (or second if they beat Bournemouth by a margin on 11 goals). The Toffees have endured a decent start with their new signings certainly adding something to the squad and have hit the ground jogging, at least. It is never easy to go to the Vitality Stadium, as they found on their last visit, throwing away a two-goal lead and ending up with just a point. Both teams ended up with 10 men that day, so it could be another physical encounter. I cannot wait!",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Fights also broke out in the nearby neighbourhood of North Point, a pro-government district where dozens of local residents jeered at riot police who arrived at the scene to break up the fights. Pro-democracy lawmaker Ted Hui was arrested late night for obstructing police after he tried to persuade them to release a couple, reported public broadcaster RTHK. A university student reporter was also taken away by police for having a knife in his bag, even though he claimed it was for cutting moon cakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival the night before, RTHK said.</p> \n<p>Sunday\u2019s clashes came after ugly scenes of brawls between anti-government and pro-Beijing demonstrators on Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/14/hong-kong-15th-week-of-mass-protests\">marking the 15th consecutive weekend</a> of mass protests that have roiled Hong Kong for the last three months.</p> \n<p>Much of the demonstrations are centred on public anger toward the police as authorities crack down harder on protesters by force.

On Sunday, they set fires outside a metro station and smashed glass windows and display cases inside the stations.

      "bodyText": "A peaceful rally in Hong Kong has descended into chaos as police fired teargas and water cannon at protesters who hurled petrol bombs, set fires and clashed with residents. Tens of thousands of demonstrators defied a police ban and marched on the seat of the government calling for greater democracy in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. Hundreds of protesters who splintered off from the march surrounded the government complex, throwing rocks and molotov cocktails, prompting riot police to respond with multiple rounds of teargas as well as water cannon that covered demonstrators in blue dye, meant to help identify protesters for arrest later. In a statement, the police said they deployed teargas, rubber bullets, sponge rounds and \u201ccrowd management vehicles\u201d on demonstrators participating in an \u201cunauthorised assembly\u201d. It also said two police officers withdrew pistols at one point when they were attacked by around 20 protesters who hurled petrol bombs at them. The Hong Kong government issued a late night statement \u201cseverely condemning the violent acts which totally disregard law and order.\u201d Skirmishes broke out in various locations across Hong Kong as protesters scattered after the police dispersal. In the residential area of Fortress Hill, men in white T-shirts beat people with rods and stools. Lam, a 30-year-old man who asked to only give his surname, was knocked to the ground and kicked repeatedly by a group of men. \u201cI saw men rushing out of [metro] station with chairs to hit \u2026 they were doing the beating. I yelled, \u2018someone is beating [people] and they rushed me \u2026 and beat me,\u201d he said. Fights also broke out in the nearby neighbourhood of North Point, a pro-government district where dozens of local residents jeered at riot police who arrived at the scene to break up the fights. Pro-democracy lawmaker Ted Hui was arrested late night for obstructing police after he tried to persuade them to release a couple, reported public broadcaster RTHK. A university student reporter was also taken away by police for having a knife in his bag, even though he claimed it was for cutting moon cakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival the night before, RTHK said. Sunday\u2019s clashes came after ugly scenes of brawls between anti-government and pro-Beijing demonstrators on Saturday, marking the 15th consecutive weekend of mass protests that have roiled Hong Kong for the last three months. Much of the demonstrations are centred on public anger toward the police as authorities crack down harder on protesters by force. More than 1,000 people have been arrested. \u201cPlease tell the world,\u201d said Lo, 41, who lives in Fortress Hill, where bystanders yelled at the police to leave. \u201cWe are suffering. We are scared every day when the police come out.\u201d The demonstrators, many of them young students, have also become more violent. On Sunday, they set fires outside a metro station and smashed glass windows and display cases inside the stations. Video footage posted online showed what appeared to be a group of black-clad demonstrators mobbing a man. In another, a group was seen beating up a young man. Crowds of demonstrators had marched earlier in the day, chanting \u201cResist Beijing, liberate Hong Kong\u201d. Many held up their right hands in reference to the five demands of the protesters, which include an independent investigation into police behaviour. The protests mark Hong Kong\u2019s \u2013 as well as Beijing\u2019s \u2013 most serious political crisis in decades, triggered by a proposal to allow extradition to mainland China. As the protests have dragged on, confrontations between police and protesters have become increasingly violent. \u201cIf we fail this time, we will not have a second chance. Our civil society will be repressed by the Chinese Communist party. So we have to keep going,\u201d said Gerald Chan, 24, a master\u2019s student who was wearing reflective goggles and held a shield improvised from street signs. Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, has said she will permanently withdraw the controversial bill but the demonstrations have expanded to take on new demands, including an independent investigation into the police and implementation of universal suffrage. \u201cThis is not the Hong Kong we know,\u201d said Tim Cheng, 42, a father of two, who said the demand he most wanted to see met was the inquiry into police behaviour. \u201cWhen I was young, my parents and teachers told me that if I was in trouble to contact the police. Now I can\u2019t tell my kids that.\u201d Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of pro-democracy protesters had gathered outside the British consulate in Hong Kong chanting \u201cwe will not surrender\u201d as they called on the UK to come to the aid of the former British colony, handed over to Chinese control in 1997. Demonstrators waved the union flag, sang God Save the Queen and chanted \u201cStand for freedom, stand with Hong Kong\u201d. China has called the handover agreement signed by the UK and China in 1997 \u2013 the joint declaration \u2013 a \u201chistorical document\u201d with \u201cno practical significance\u201d. Chinese officials have lashed out at the UK for signalling its support of Hong Kong. A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman in June said the document was a \u201clegally binding treaty \u2026 that remains as valid today as it was when it was signed\u201d. Beijing and pro-China figures in Hong Kong have previously accused foreign powers including the US and the UK of secretly funding and organising the rallies. On Saturday, Joshua Wong, the democracy activist and former student leader of the 2014 umbrella movement in Hong Kong, called on US officials to include Hong Kong and a human rights clause in ongoing negotiations as the US and China try to resolve a long-running trade war and for lawmakers to pass legislation that could sanction Hong Kong officials. On Sunday, families, middle-aged and elderly residents, marched, chanting \u201cReclaim Hong Kong!\u201d and held signs that said \u201cGuard the next generation\u201d. \u201cWe owe them a lot, they have sacrificed a lot.

      "body": "<p>When Carlie Thomas arrived in a seaside town in the south of England, she wondered if she was in the wrong place. She was there to support young people affected by county lines, but the group of 22 boys she was working with, aged 12 to 17, were all close friends who did not show any obvious signs of exploitation and abuse. She called the head office at St Giles Trust in London, where she is a senior caseworker, to suggest going elsewhere.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wondered whether we were in the wrong spot,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then we had some clients tell us that they\u2019ve been robbed and that they owed money. And, not long after that, other youngsters started disclosing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The disclosures revealed a picture radically different to one a casual observer might expect. Instead of chaos and obvious brutality, the county lines operation in the area was a meticulously crafted affair that shared some characteristics with an ordinary commercial enterprise. Instead of taking over drug users\u2019 homes through force and fear, out-of-area gangs were renting Airbnb properties to manufacture and sell drugs, manipulating young people to work for them, and luring them with offers of stable, potentially risk-free employment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6a3d0869-31b2-4f55-9050-b16658db33d2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What does the term \u2018county lines\u2019 mean?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The name \u2018county lines\u2019 refers to the phone numbers, or lines, that criminal gangs which traffic drugs from urban to rural areas use to organise the sale of their wares.

But this seaside operation, the extent of which can be revealed in detail for the first time by the Guardian, shows how in some cases gangs are becoming more sophisticated and running their organisations like legitimate businesses. In such cases, county lines is professionalising.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we always associate county lines with is addicts, needles, bandos [abandoned houses], and prostitutes, but to see how well organised with and how happy the boys were with the situation was even more terrifying,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBecause I thought \u2026 how on earth was I meant to pull you out?\u201d</p> \n<p>The teenage boys would race to get to the Airbnb at 9am, when the work day began. Work was handed out on a first come, first served basis. Once everyone was given their role, the boys\u2019 lunch order would be taken and an efficient factory line would be set up.</p> \n<p>During lunch, the boys would be given an hour to eat their takeaway, often McDonald\u2019s, and play video games. When the lease was over, the boys would clear up and the surfaces would be bleached. They would then move to the next Airbnb property, leaving no trace. Each boy would be given \u00a3250 for the day\u2019s work.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a world away from what the majority of children trafficked into county lines experience. One mother, who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity, said her son was first given cannabis for free, but within days he was told he owed a debt to the local gang.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey roughed him up. When I did pick him up he had loads of bruises on him and he needed a good meal,\u201d she said. She later found threatening messages on his phone and her son admitted he had been forced to stay in a trap house (drug house), where he had to help package and distribute drugs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f65a14bb7fef993a7e1673fdd11ad38ffe0aaad\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f65a14bb7fef993a7e1673fdd11ad38ffe0aaad/0_266_5717_3432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A county lines victim\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A county lines victim.

There\u2019s no way those youngsters were disclosing anything to the police,\u201d Thomas said.</p> \n<p>When compared with the work they were doing before, dealing drugs round the clock in a crack house, the current operation was far less risky and the hours shorter.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey would say: what\u2019s the problem? In their mind, they\u2019re not going missing, they\u2019re not in a dangerous or dirty position. They don\u2019t have to normalise the badness because they feel nothing bad is going on in the house. They felt they were being treated really well and felt they weren\u2019t being exploited. But of course they were,\u201d Thomas said.</p> \n<p>The Airbnb operation is just one of a handful of tactics being used by gangs to focus on their profit margin, which youth workers say drive vulnerable children further underground.</p> \n<p>In London, there has long been a correlation between a child missing for a substantial period of time and county lines activity, but that has begun to change. Evan Jones, the head of community services at St Giles Trust, said some dealers now know the exact number of days of absences from school that trigger a response from social services.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a constantly evolving business model \u2013 they are always looking at what\u2019s picking them up and what\u2019s alerting the authorities. We\u2019ve had reports of kids working around the school timetable; doing drug deliveries before school, during lunchtime or after school. It\u2019s about keeping them under the radar and not triggering the alerts that would be set off if kids went missing.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s even easier to conceal the county lines activity of a young person at a pupil referral units (PRUs), Jones said.

      "bodyText": "When Carlie Thomas arrived in a seaside town in the south of England, she wondered if she was in the wrong place. She was there to support young people affected by county lines, but the group of 22 boys she was working with, aged 12 to 17, were all close friends who did not show any obvious signs of exploitation and abuse. She called the head office at St Giles Trust in London, where she is a senior caseworker, to suggest going elsewhere. \u201cI wondered whether we were in the wrong spot,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then we had some clients tell us that they\u2019ve been robbed and that they owed money. And, not long after that, other youngsters started disclosing.\u201d The disclosures revealed a picture radically different to one a casual observer might expect. Instead of chaos and obvious brutality, the county lines operation in the area was a meticulously crafted affair that shared some characteristics with an ordinary commercial enterprise. Instead of taking over drug users\u2019 homes through force and fear, out-of-area gangs were renting Airbnb properties to manufacture and sell drugs, manipulating young people to work for them, and luring them with offers of stable, potentially risk-free employment. A more conventional model of county lines is still prevalent \u2013 and often synonymous with thuggishness and brute force. But this seaside operation, the extent of which can be revealed in detail for the first time by the Guardian, shows how in some cases gangs are becoming more sophisticated and running their organisations like legitimate businesses. In such cases, county lines is professionalising. \u201cWhat we always associate county lines with is addicts, needles, bandos [abandoned houses], and prostitutes, but to see how well organised with and how happy the boys were with the situation was even more terrifying,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBecause I thought \u2026 how on earth was I meant to pull you out?\u201d The teenage boys would race to get to the Airbnb at 9am, when the work day began. Work was handed out on a first come, first served basis. Once everyone was given their role, the boys\u2019 lunch order would be taken and an efficient factory line would be set up. During lunch, the boys would be given an hour to eat their takeaway, often McDonald\u2019s, and play video games. When the lease was over, the boys would clear up and the surfaces would be bleached. They would then move to the next Airbnb property, leaving no trace. Each boy would be given \u00a3250 for the day\u2019s work. It\u2019s a world away from what the majority of children trafficked into county lines experience. One mother, who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity, said her son was first given cannabis for free, but within days he was told he owed a debt to the local gang. \u201cThey roughed him up. When I did pick him up he had loads of bruises on him and he needed a good meal,\u201d she said. She later found threatening messages on his phone and her son admitted he had been forced to stay in a trap house (drug house), where he had to help package and distribute drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s clear and obvious what\u2019s going on in the bandos and trap houses, but when you\u2019ve got Airbnb, they can be moving every two days and it\u2019s impossible to pin that down,\u201d Thomas said. The well-organised operation posed a real challenge for social services. \u201cIt makes it more difficult to reach them. There\u2019s no way those youngsters were disclosing anything to the police,\u201d Thomas said. When compared with the work they were doing before, dealing drugs round the clock in a crack house, the current operation was far less risky and the hours shorter. \u201cThey would say: what\u2019s the problem? In their mind, they\u2019re not going missing, they\u2019re not in a dangerous or dirty position. They don\u2019t have to normalise the badness because they feel nothing bad is going on in the house. They felt they were being treated really well and felt they weren\u2019t being exploited. But of course they were,\u201d Thomas said. The Airbnb operation is just one of a handful of tactics being used by gangs to focus on their profit margin, which youth workers say drive vulnerable children further underground. In London, there has long been a correlation between a child missing for a substantial period of time and county lines activity, but that has begun to change. Evan Jones, the head of community services at St Giles Trust, said some dealers now know the exact number of days of absences from school that trigger a response from social services. \u201cIt\u2019s a constantly evolving business model \u2013 they are always looking at what\u2019s picking them up and what\u2019s alerting the authorities. We\u2019ve had reports of kids working around the school timetable; doing drug deliveries before school, during lunchtime or after school. It\u2019s about keeping them under the radar and not triggering the alerts that would be set off if kids went missing.\u201d It\u2019s even easier to conceal the county lines activity of a young person at a pupil referral units (PRUs), Jones said. Some students have what he called \u201ctwilight hours\u201d, where they are only expected to be at the PRU for a couple of hours a day. \u201cWe know of kids who go and deliver drugs to a seaside town and still attend their PRU.\u201d There are also signs that London gangs are turning to local children to distribute drugs. Jo Hudek, who evaluated a Home Office project run by St Giles and Missing People, told a meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on knife crime that of the 40 or so children supported by that particular scheme, the majority were local children. \u201cThere are still London children being trafficked down there with drugs for supply, but it really shows that this is a business model and the commodity is drugs and money, it doesn\u2019t really matter who is selling it,\u201d she previously told the Guardian. In a calculated investment aimed at expanding their reach, certain gangs offer children an extra \u00a3200 when they bring a friend to work on a line. This commission-based work has led to some young people receiving bonuses for carrying out work efficiently. It\u2019s this \u201cglamorous\u201d lifestyle that is often shown on social media, which has become an increasingly important recruitment tool. Craig Pinkney, a lecturer in criminology at University College Birmingham, said: \u201cWe are in a technological era where criminals are utilising social media platforms like Snapchat and Instagram to entice, encourage and ultimately exploit young people. \u201cThis can be any young person.

It is bad news for the perfume manufacturers, but good for people such as Lesley Heidinger, a 46-year-old call-centre worker from Edmonton in Canada. Heidinger has multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), a little-known condition characterised by heightened sensitivity to a wide range of chemicals, many of which are commonly found in soap, detergent, sanitiser gels and perfumes. She can tolerate natural scents, including most essential oils, but synthetic fragrances are bothersome. If Heidinger inhales a colleague\u2019s scent, her sinuses will become irritated, she will wheeze and cough and it will bring on a migraine that can last for days. Other reported symptoms of MCS include muscle pain, exhaustion and disorientation.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a constant battle,\u201d Heidinger says. She has been off work for much of the year, as her symptoms have been particularly bad. Although her employers have implemented a scent-reduced zone around her desk \u2013 meaning that colleagues in her immediate vicinity have been asked not to wear fragrances \u2013 this doesn\u2019t apply to communal spaces. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people realise the real impact of it,\u201d she sighs. \u201cIt makes me incredibly ill. Having a migraine for a week is really unpleasant.\u201d</p> <p>Heidinger is also sensitive to smoke and the fragrance from washing powder and fabric conditioners. Things got so bad that she had to sell her flat, because it had a shared laundry room, and move somewhere with its own washer-dryer, so she wouldn\u2019t be exposed to the smell of other people\u2019s laundry. On a recent flight to Italy, Heidinger had to switch seats because the woman next to her was wearing perfume. \u201cI could smell it as soon as she sat down. I just said: \u2018I can\u2019t sit next to you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Heidinger\u2019s MCS is medically recognised: she has been diagnosed by her doctor and receives disability benefits when she is unable to work. But not everyone is met with compassion and validation by medical professionals. Online forums for people with MCS are full of stories of not being taken seriously by doctors, while there is debate within medicine about whether MCS is physiological or psychological. A US study in 2011 found that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168894/\" title=\"\">only 30% of doctors surveyed had received formal training about MCS</a>. The NHS website does not publish treatment guidelines for MCS.</p> <p>\u201cThese people are orphans of conventional medicine,\u201d says Dr Apelles Econs, an allergy specialist at the Burghwood Clinic in Surrey. As people with MCS are intolerant of chemicals, rather than allergic to them, allergy tests often come back negative. \u201cThey may be told they\u2019re imagining it, and referred to psychiatric colleagues to see if they can manage the condition,\u201d Econs says. \u201cBut, in reality, the root of the problem has not been addressed properly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an under-recognised condition,\u201d agrees Prof Howard Hu, a leading environmental health expert at the University of Washington School of Public Health. (MCS is sometimes referred to as environmental illness, as sufferers are triggered by external chemicals in their living and working environments.) But Hu believes the medical community\u2019s perspective on MCS is changing. \u201cThere\u2019s some decent research coming out ... In my opinion, the evidence is good that there\u2019s something neurological going on that\u2019s triggered by an odour and leads to a cascade of events in the brain that manifest as these symptoms. Is it physiological or psychological? It\u2019s somewhere in between \u2013 the tools we have to investigate these disorders are still pretty primitive.\u201d</p> <p>Until more is known about MCS, offering fragrance-free public spaces would be a welcome move. \u201cIt would be miraculous, because of how ill being exposed to something makes me,\u201d Heidinger says. \u201cIt\u2019s really demoralising not to be able to go to work and enjoy life to its fullest because of this. It\u2019s not a fun way to live.\u201d</p>",

Things got so bad that she had to sell her flat, because it had a shared laundry room, and move somewhere with its own washer-dryer, so she wouldn\u2019t be exposed to the smell of other people\u2019s laundry. On a recent flight to Italy, Heidinger had to switch seats because the woman next to her was wearing perfume. \u201cI could smell it as soon as she sat down. I just said: \u2018I can\u2019t sit next to you.\u2019\u201d Heidinger\u2019s MCS is medically recognised: she has been diagnosed by her doctor and receives disability benefits when she is unable to work. But not everyone is met with compassion and validation by medical professionals. Online forums for people with MCS are full of stories of not being taken seriously by doctors, while there is debate within medicine about whether MCS is physiological or psychological. A US study in 2011 found that only 30% of doctors surveyed had received formal training about MCS. The NHS website does not publish treatment guidelines for MCS. \u201cThese people are orphans of conventional medicine,\u201d says Dr Apelles Econs, an allergy specialist at the Burghwood Clinic in Surrey. As people with MCS are intolerant of chemicals, rather than allergic to them, allergy tests often come back negative. \u201cThey may be told they\u2019re imagining it, and referred to psychiatric colleagues to see if they can manage the condition,\u201d Econs says. \u201cBut, in reality, the root of the problem has not been addressed properly.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an under-recognised condition,\u201d agrees Prof Howard Hu, a leading environmental health expert at the University of Washington School of Public Health. (MCS is sometimes referred to as environmental illness, as sufferers are triggered by external chemicals in their living and working environments.) But Hu believes the medical community\u2019s perspective on MCS is changing. \u201cThere\u2019s some decent research coming out ... In my opinion, the evidence is good that there\u2019s something neurological going on that\u2019s triggered by an odour and leads to a cascade of events in the brain that manifest as these symptoms. Is it physiological or psychological? It\u2019s somewhere in between \u2013 the tools we have to investigate these disorders are still pretty primitive.\u201d Until more is known about MCS, offering fragrance-free public spaces would be a welcome move. \u201cIt would be miraculous, because of how ill being exposed to something makes me,\u201d Heidinger says. \u201cIt\u2019s really demoralising not to be able to go to work and enjoy life to its fullest because of this. It\u2019s not a fun way to live.\u201d",

The visitors had the better of the first half at the Hive, but found themselves trailing when some sloppy play at the back allowed Furness to steal into the box and win a penalty. She got up to dispatch it, and Liverpool chances faded midway through the second half when Niamh Fahey was sent off for a cynical foul on Rosella Ayane. </p> \n  <p>Elsewhere a pair of sensational long-range goals \u2013 the second struck from 35 yards \u2013 by Chloe Kelly took <strong>Everton</strong> to a 2-0 win over <strong>Bristol City</strong>. The win takes the Toffees level on points at the top of the table with <strong>Manchester City</strong>, who won by the same scoreline at <strong>Reading</strong>, Pauline Bremer with both the goals. And stoppage-time strike from Adelina Engman earned <strong>Chelsea</strong> a point at <strong>Brighton</strong>, who were denied a fist win of the season after taking a late lead through Aileen Whelan.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7e504b8f08f30dc5bbbc5d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T14:57:05.671Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Tottenham 1-0 Liverpool</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>And that\u2019s that</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Rachel Furness\u2019s coolly taken penalty was enough to clinch a narrow win for Tottenham against Liverpool in the first ever meeting between the two sides. The visitors had the better of the first half at the Hive, but found themselves trailing when some sloppy play at the back allowed Furness to steal into the box and win a penalty. She got up to dispatch it, and Liverpool chances faded midway through the second half when Niamh Fahey was sent off for a cynical foul on Rosella Ayane. Elsewhere a pair of sensational long-range goals \u2013 the second struck from 35 yards \u2013 by Chloe Kelly took Everton to a 2-0 win over Bristol City. The win takes the Toffees level on points at the top of the table with Manchester City, who won by the same scoreline at Reading, Pauline Bremer with both the goals. And stoppage-time strike from Adelina Engman earned Chelsea a point at Brighton, who were denied a fist win of the season after taking a late lead through Aileen Whelan. And that\u2019s that. Spurs\u2019 points are secure, and they were hard earned. Liverpool remain pointless after two games, and it was the red card for Fahey that spelled the end for their chances here. They saw plenty of the ball but badly lacked cutting edge up front. Spurs, meanwhile, can bask in the glory of a first ever WSL win. Thanks for reading! 93 mins: Quinn bombs forward to win a throw in the Liverpool half. She\u2019s in no hurry to take it \u2026 90 mins: Dean\u2019s first act is to be put through for a one-on-one \u2013 Liverpool\u2019s defence have completely abandoned stations \u2013 but she\u2019s just offside. We\u2019re into injury time now. 89 mins: A final substitution for Tottenham. Last season\u2019s top scorer, Rianna Dean, comes on for Rosella Ayane, who leaves to hearty applause. Liverpool continue their arial bombardment to little effect. 85 mins: It\u2019s kitchen-sink time for Liverpool, who have begun to hump long balls towards the Spurs box. The hosts deal with them easily, one eye on the clock. 83 mins: Preuss is called into action again as Peplow bends one in from range. Spurs are looking to put this to bed. 80 mins: David has a chance to wrap up the win, sent clean through by Furness down the inside-right channel. She bear down on goal at a slight angle, but rather than striking across Preuss she goes for the near post and the Liverpool keeper is able to palm it wide. 76 mins: Liverpool, somewhat inevitably, have had the wind taken out of their sales by that sending off. A rare incursion into enemy territory sees Babajide sprint clear down the right but her cross goes straight out for a goal kick. Vicky Jepson throws on Ashley Hodson for Jess Clarke. 74 mins: Spurs make another change: Kit Graham off, Lucy Quinn on. 72 mins: Babajide scampers in behind the Spurs defence but the through-ball is just overhit, and she trots back to her position. 69 mins: Liverpool\u2019s job has just got a whole lot harder. Although not strictly because of Fahey\u2019s foul. Had she let Ayane go, they\u2019d likely be 2-0 down. Fahey is given her marching orders and it\u2019s just about the clearest red card decision you\u2019ll ever see. A Spurs punt upfield looks unthreatening enough but the cheetah-like Ayane gives chase anyway \u2013 and makes up a good 10 yards on the lumbering Fahey before stealing the ball to find herself clean through, 30 yards from goal. Fahey has a decision to make: take the striker down or let the one-on-one unfold. She opts for the former, halting Ayane with an excellent double-handed waist-grab. And that\u2019s her afternoon over. Liverpool promptly make a change: Rodgers off, Purfield on. 60 mins: A purposeful surge forward from Ayane kickstarts a Spurs attack, which ends with Gemma Davison jinking in from the left and battering the ball at goal. It\u2019s a terrific effort. Preuss dives to palm wide, and from resulting corner finds its way out Peplow, whose ambitious long-ranger flies over. Green replaces Worm. 58 mins: Liverpool change: Charles off, Babajide on. 55 mins: Good hold-up play by Sweetman-Kirk, who collects a long clearance, controls perfectly and funnels the ball to the advancing Clarke. She exchanges passes with Charles, and square to Sweetman-Kirk, who has made her way to the penalty spot. But the striker can\u2019t connect properly with the cross and her mis-hit shot bobbles wide. That was Liverpool\u2019s best attack. 51 mins: Neville and Robe clatter into a good old-fashioned 50-50. The Spurs players gets there first, swiftly followed by a set of her opponents\u2019 studs. Neville rubs her shin, wincing. Robe sees yellow. 48 mins: Liverpool have begun with intent, working the ball crisply upfield, but still appear unsure as to how to create a clearcut chance. Sweetman-Kirk has been anonymous. Spurs get us back under way. There\u2019s no good time to concede. But that was an especially bad one for Liverpool, who had weathered a period of Spurs pressure to resume their early dominance and were looking the better bet to open the scoring. But the signs were there that they were overcomplicating things at the back. They\u2019ll need less of that sort of nonsense in the second half \u2013 and a lot more bite in the final third. Spurs, meanwhile, just need to shut up shop. Easier said that done though. The teams are back out. It\u2019s the last kick of the half, and it certainly changes things for Liverpool. They\u2019ll need to come out swinging now. And Furness gets up to slot the spot-kick home with her left foot, Preuss sent the wrong way. Liverpool\u2019s dallying at the back costs them as Fahey is robbed by Percival, who give it to Furness. She steams into the box and is taken down in desperate fashion by Jane. 43 mins: Furness uncorks one from long distance. It\u2019s a powerful hit, but Preuss parries to safety 40 mins: Liverpool maintain pressure but seem to run out of ideas as soon as the goal comes into view. Tantric football. 36 mins: Liverpool begin to turn the screw again, Lawley working the ball out to Rodgers, whose shot is blocked. Then Clarke, roving forward from the left, cuts inside and lashes a decent 25-yard effort at goal, which Spencer saves with relative ease. 32 mins: Lawley toys with her marker in midfield, showboating with a pair of stepovers before drifting out to the right. But it\u2019s a cul-de-sac. She loses the ball \u2013 but she\u2019s Liverpool\u2019s brightest creative spark by some distance. 29 mins: It\u2019s end-to-end stuff now. Spurs keep pressing, Furness underhitting a cross before a Liverpool counter ends with Sweetman-Kirk slide-tackled at the last. 24 mins: A marauding run form Gemma Davison, past a nonexistent Liverpool midfield and towards the heart of their defence. The ball is worked out to the right and Neville\u2019s cross is blocked, before Davison belts another shot into a red-clad midriff. You sense a Spurs goal coming. 21 mins: It\u2019s nearly one-nil Spurs as Graham feeds Furness in the inside-left channel, sending the winger haring into the box after the ball. The onrushing Pruess gets there first and smothers, but it only by a split second. 18 mins: Spurs have settled a bit and have begun to pass the ball with conviction. Liverpool\u2019s attempts to play it out from the back are less reassuring and result in a halfhearted Spurs penalty appeal when they steal the ball and Percival falls in the box. Percival then sends a long-ranger harmlessly wide. But Spurs have gained momentum. 14 mins: The game\u2019s first moment of true quality comes from Amy Rodgers, who picks up the ball in the centre circle and surges forward before dispatching goalwards from 25 yards. The shot is struck sweetly and has Spencer scrambling, but flashes just wide of the post. 11 mins: A loose pass from Jane is pounced on by the Spurs midfield and Furness is released down the left. She needs to decide whether to shoot or cross, but does a hopeless combination of both and the ball skitters out for a goal kick. 9 mins: A first involvement for Preuss in the Liverpool goal, who marches off her line confidently to claim a free-kick floated in by Percival. Good goalkeeping. 6 mins: It\u2019s Spurs\u2019 turn to attack: their first foray into Liverpool\u2019s box culminates with Ayane latching on to a half-cleared ball and miscuing a left-foot volley well wide. 4 mins: The visitors continue to make inroads into Spurs territory. Jane surges forward from right-back and is brought down by Peplow. Lawley uses the free-kick to disguise a square pass to Rodgers, whose 20-yarder flies just over the bar. 2 mins: Liverpool with the better of the opening exchanges, Lawley already embarking on a couple of dribbles down the left. One earns a corner, easily cleared. And we\u2019re off. Liverpool with kickoff, from which Lawley scampers forward from kickoff before possession reverts to the back four. The teams are out. And Ria Percival, who joined from West Ham in the summer, will be captaining Spurs today. Check out this goal! Tottenham: Spencer, Neville, Godfrey, Filbey, Worm, Percival, Peplow, Furness, Ayane, Davison, Graham. Subs: Morgan, Schillaci, Wynne, Green, Haines, Dean, Quinn. Liverpool: Preuss, Jane, Bradley-Auckland, Fahey, Robe, Bailey, Rodgers, Charles, Lawley, Clarke, Sweetman-Kirk. Subs: Kitching, Purfield, Hodson, Babajide, Linnett The Hive will witness history being made today when Liverpool visit the capital for the first ever meeting between these two sides.

Here are five things we learned from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/13/david-cameron-accuses-boris-johnson-and-michael-gove-of-behaving-appallingly-over-brexit\">the book</a>.</p> <h2>What he thinks of Boris Johnson</h2> <p>Boris Johnson \u201cdidn\u2019t believe\u201d in Brexit, but backed the leave campaign to further his career. Johnson wanted to become the \u201cdarling of the party\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to risk allowing someone else with a high profile \u2013 Michael Gove in particular \u2013 to win that crown\u201d, Cameron claims. \u201cThe conclusion I am left with is that he risked an outcome he didn\u2019t believe in because it would help his political career.\u201d Furthermore, Cameron claims Johnson privately believed there should be a second referendum to confirm the terms of Brexit \u2013 something Johnson has strongly resisted since. He reveals he tried to stop Johnson joining the Brexit campaign by offering him the post of defence secretary. Johnson, he says, believed the leave camp would lose, and if it did win, there could always be a fresh negotiation followed by a second referendum.</p> <h2>His opinions on Michael Gove</h2> <p>Cameron turns on Michael Gove, once a close friend, in a blistering attack, referring to him as \u201cmendacious\u201d. He describes him as a \u201cfoam-flecked Faragist warning that the entire Turkish population was about to come to Britain\u201d. He reveals he texted Gove: \u201cYou are either a team player or a wanker.\u201d He adds : \u201cOne quality shone through, disloyalty. Disloyalty to me and, later, disloyalty to Boris\u201d. Gove\u2019s claims the public were tired of experts made him \u201can ambassador for the truth-twisting age of populism\u201d. While Cameron claims Johnson did not believe in Brexit, he says of Gove: \u201cMichael had backed something he did perhaps believe in, but in the process had broken with his friends \u2013 while taking up positions that were completely against his political identity.\u201d<br></p> <h2>He (partly) regrets the 2016 European referendum</h2> <p>Cameron comes close to issuing an apology. He has no regrets about calling the referendum, saying it was \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cinevitable\u201d. But he says he is sorry about the divisions it has caused. He writes that he thinks about the consequences daily and worries \u201cdesperately\u201d about what will happen. He claims he was disadvantaged in campaigning for Remain. Both Johnson and Gove \u201cbehaved appallingly\u201d, attacking their own government, turning a blind eye to their side\u2019s unpleasant actions. But, as prime minister, Cameron felt he could not hit back as hard, resulting in \u201casymmetric warfare\u201d. The referendum turned into a Conservative party psychodrama, he writes, and he was \u201chugely depressed\u201d about leaving his post as prime minister. \u201cI deeply regret the outcome and accept that my approach failed. The decisions I took contributed to that failure. I failed.\u201d On the leave campaign\u2019s mastermind, Dominic Cummings, now Johnson\u2019s top aide, and Farage, he claims they were part of a \u201ccauldron of toxicity\u201d with \u201csomething of the night about them\u201d.<br></p> <h2>What he feels about his family</h2> <p>Cameron describes his despair at the death of his first-born son Ivan, who died aged six in 2009, and had Ohtahara syndrome, suffering multiple seizures daily. \u201cNothing, absolutely nothing, can prepare you for the reality of losing your darling boy in this way. It was as if the world stopped turning,\u201d he writes. Then leader of the opposition, he was due to attend prime minister\u2019s questions in the commons on the day after Ivan\u2019s death. But Gordon Brown, whose daughter Jennifer Jane died a few days after birth in 2002, adjourned the house for the day. Cameron writes that Brown\u2019s \u201creal warmth and humanity\u201d meant a lot to both him and wife Samantha.</p> <p>The effect of Brexit on his three other children is also revealed. His daughter, Nancy, aged 12 at the time of the referendum, took \u201cConservative in\u201d badges to school to hand to friends. At a school fair an older girl, asked if she was for \u201cout\u201d or \u201cin\u201d. Cameron wrote: \u201cNancy replied she was for in. The girl said, \u2018well , f*** you\u2019. Nancy replied, \u2018well, f*** you too\u2019. Sam and I had never heard her say the f-word. We thought it was a bit shocking, but rather extraordinary.\u201d<br></p> <h2>His proudest moment in office</h2> <p>One of the proudest moments of his premiership, Cameron says, was the introduction of same-sex marriage, though he had worried and \u201cwobbled\u201d over the issue and faced heated opposition within the Conservative party: \u201cEqual marriage was one of the most contentious, hard-fought and divisive issues during my time as prime minister.\u201d One party member tore up his card in front of him. But, he acknowledges, he did regret abstaining from voting on an Iain Duncan Smith motion to block gay couples\u2019 right to adopt children. \u201cI should have proactively supported that right,\u201d he wrote.</p>",

Last month a UN panel of government experts debated autonomous weapons and found Google to be eschewing AI for use in weapons systems and engaging in best practice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cbbdd73c70b5ddf91e571b9704d4ec06968c545\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cbbdd73c70b5ddf91e571b9704d4ec06968c545/0_0_8688_5792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Nolan resigned from Google last year in protest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Nolan resigned from Google last year in protest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Savage/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nolan, who has joined the <a href=\"https://www.stopkillerrobots.org/\">Campaign </a><a href=\"https://www.stopkillerrobots.org/\">to Stop Killer Robots</a> and has briefed UN diplomats in New York and Geneva over the dangers posed by autonomous weapons, said: \u201cThe likelihood of a disaster is in proportion to how many of these machines will be in a particular area at once.

      "bodyText": "A new generation of autonomous weapons or \u201ckiller robots\u201d could accidentally start a war or cause mass atrocities, a former top Google software engineer has warned. Laura Nolan, who resigned from Google last year in protest at being sent to work on a project to dramatically enhance US military drone technology, has called for all AI killing machines not operated by humans to be banned. Nolan said killer robots not guided by human remote control should be outlawed by the same type of international treaty that bans chemical weapons. Unlike drones, which are controlled by military teams often thousands of miles away from where the flying weapon is being deployed, Nolan said killer robots have the potential to do \u201ccalamitous things that they were not originally programmed for\u201d. There is no suggestion that Google is involved in the development of autonomous weapons systems. Last month a UN panel of government experts debated autonomous weapons and found Google to be eschewing AI for use in weapons systems and engaging in best practice. Nolan, who has joined the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and has briefed UN diplomats in New York and Geneva over the dangers posed by autonomous weapons, said: \u201cThe likelihood of a disaster is in proportion to how many of these machines will be in a particular area at once. What you are looking at are possible atrocities and unlawful killings even under laws of warfare, especially if hundreds or thousands of these machines are deployed. \u201cThere could be large-scale accidents because these things will start to behave in unexpected ways. Which is why any advanced weapons systems should be subject to meaningful human control, otherwise they have to be banned because they are far too unpredictable and dangerous.\u201d Google recruited Nolan, a computer science graduate from Trinity College Dublin, to work on Project Maven in 2017 after she had been employed by the tech giant for four years, becoming one of its top software engineers in Ireland. She said she became \u201cincreasingly ethically concerned\u201d over her role in the Maven programme, which was devised to help the US Department of Defense drastically speed up drone video recognition technology. Instead of using large numbers of military operatives to spool through hours and hours of drone video footage of potential enemy targets, Nolan and others were asked to build a system where AI machines could differentiate people and objects at an infinitely faster rate. Google allowed the Project Maven contract to lapse in March this year after more than 3,000 of its employees signed a petition in protest against the company\u2019s involvement. \u201cAs a site reliability engineer my expertise at Google was to ensure that our systems and infrastructures were kept running, and this is what I was supposed to help Maven with. Although I was not directly involved in speeding up the video footage recognition I realised that I was still part of the kill chain; that this would ultimately lead to more people being targeted and killed by the US military in places like Afghanistan.\u201d Although she resigned over Project Maven, Nolan has predicted that autonomous weapons being developed pose a far greater risk to the human race than remote-controlled drones. She outlined how external forces ranging from changing weather systems to machines being unable to work out complex human behaviour might throw killer robots off course, with possibly fatal consequences. \u201cYou could have a scenario where autonomous weapons that have been sent out to do a job confront unexpected radar signals in an area they are searching; there could be weather that was not factored into its software or they come across a group of armed men who appear to be insurgent enemies but in fact are out with guns hunting for food. The machine doesn\u2019t have the discernment or common sense that the human touch has. \u201cThe other scary thing about these autonomous war systems is that you can only really test them by deploying them in a real combat zone. Maybe that\u2019s happening with the Russians at present in Syria, who knows?

She said she wanted the Irish government to take a more robust line in supporting a ban on such weapons. \u201cI am not saying that missile-guided systems or anti-missile defence systems should be banned.

Very few people are talking about this but if we are not careful one or more of these weapons, these killer robots, could accidentally start a flash war, destroy a nuclear power station and cause mass atrocities.\u201d Autonomous threat? Some of the autonomous weapons being developed by military powers around the world include: The US navy\u2019s AN-2 Anaconda gunboat, which is being developed as a \u201ccompletely autonomous watercraft equipped with artificial intelligence capabilities\u201d and can \u201cloiter in an area for long periods of time without human intervention\u201d. Russia\u2019s T-14 Armata tank, which is being worked on to make it completely unmanned and autonomous. It is being designed to respond to incoming fire independent of any tank crew inside. The US Pentagon has hailed the Sea Hunter autonomous warship as a major advance in robotic warfare. An unarmed 40 metre-long prototype has been launched that can cruise the ocean\u2019s surface without any crew for two to three months at a time.",

Why don\u2019t we?\u201d</p> <p>But his proposal drew criticism then, with one retired engineer comparing the feasibility of the plan to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/letters-to-the-editor-boriss-bridge-too-far-shows-he-is-not-fit-to-lead-the-country-lq2t0f6hz\">\u201cbuilding a bridge to the moon\u201d</a>.</p> <p>James Duncan, from Edinburgh, raised concerns over the practicality of constructing a bridge across the \u201cstormy\u201d stretch of water \u2013 more than 1,000ft deep in places \u2013 which would require dozens of support towers at heights \u201cnever achieved anywhere in the world\u201d. Bridge builders would also have to navigate Beaufort\u2019s Dyke, a submarine trench in which the Ministry of Defence <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14820042-200-danger-from-the-deep/\">dumped more than 1m</a><a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14820042-200-danger-from-the-deep/\"> tonnes of obsolete munitions</a> following the end of the second world war.</p> <p>Chris Wise, the engineering designer of the 2012 Olympic velodrome, said he supported the principle of connecting the two countries but raised a series of question marks over the practicality of the proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s socially admirable but technically clueless,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIf Boris wants to stay prime minister he needs to stop promising figures before he can deliver them.\u201d</p> <p>Wise, the engineering director behind London\u2019s Millennium bridge, explained: \u201cTechnically, there\u2019s a solution which is to build something in dry dock, tow it out, sink it into position. But when you\u2019re talking about something that is going to be the same height as the Eiffel Tower before you even get to sea level that\u2019s a major, major beast.</p> <p>\u201cIt probably means you\u2019re not going to be putting any supports in there [to hold up the bridge] so then the question is whether the span you\u2019re left with is something that is plausible. Because the biggest bridges in the world are only a mile, or a mile and a bit long for an individual span [without a support].\u201d</p> <p>Similar bridges have a series of supports to hold the structure in place. They include the 4.8-mile \u00d8resund bridge, which connects Sweden to Denmark.</p> <p>Wise said he was also concerned by the optimistic \u00a315bn price tag. \u201cIf everything from the Olympics to HS2 are anything to go by, to quote the number and the price of any of these publicly funded projects this early without a design, in my view, is bonkers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what something is going to cost until you know what you\u2019re going to build. So unless Boris is sitting on a design that nobody else knows about, which he may be, I think it\u2019s a bit foolhardy to put a price in the public domain. They always go up, they never go down. But it sounds cheap to me.\u201d</p> <p>Dr John McKinley, a senior lecturer in environmental engineering at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, also raised doubts. \u201cLike a lot of infrastructure questions, a bridge or tunnel across the Irish Sea is feasible engineering but dubious economics,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea has been floating around since the 1880s and seems to come around every 30 to 40 years. The shortest distance would connect Northern Ireland and Scotland, but that involves going through Beaufort\u2019s Dyke, a 200- to 300-metre deep channel in the middle of the Irish Sea.</p> <p>\u201cFor a bridge, you would need support piers more or less equal in size to the largest civil engineers have built so far. For a tunnel the underwater part would either be about three times the length of that for the Channel tunnel or go about four times as deep. Connecting Belfast to Glasgow, lovely places though I think they both are, isn\u2019t as obviously a good thing as connecting London to Paris.\u201d</p> <p>David Barwell, the UK and Ireland CEO of AECOM \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest engineering firms \u2013 said: \u201cEngineers, we can come up with any which way you want to get something like this done. You can do it \u2026 there would be an engineering solution. I think the next piece, the other piece which people are asking is, \u2018OK, well there\u2019s an engineering solution, but at what cost?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether he thought the project could be completed for \u00a315bn, he said: \u201cI really don\u2019t know. The problem is, it\u2019s always dangerous talking numbers at an early stage in the project.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokeswoman said: \u201cThe prime minister has often spoken about his support for infrastructure projects that increase connectivity for people and particularly those that strengthen the union. As you\u2019d expect, the government regularly commissions work to examine the feasibility of potential projects.\u201d</p>",

But when you\u2019re talking about something that is going to be the same height as the Eiffel Tower before you even get to sea level that\u2019s a major, major beast. \u201cIt probably means you\u2019re not going to be putting any supports in there [to hold up the bridge] so then the question is whether the span you\u2019re left with is something that is plausible. Because the biggest bridges in the world are only a mile, or a mile and a bit long for an individual span [without a support].\u201d Similar bridges have a series of supports to hold the structure in place. They include the 4.8-mile \u00d8resund bridge, which connects Sweden to Denmark. Wise said he was also concerned by the optimistic \u00a315bn price tag. \u201cIf everything from the Olympics to HS2 are anything to go by, to quote the number and the price of any of these publicly funded projects this early without a design, in my view, is bonkers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what something is going to cost until you know what you\u2019re going to build. So unless Boris is sitting on a design that nobody else knows about, which he may be, I think it\u2019s a bit foolhardy to put a price in the public domain. They always go up, they never go down. But it sounds cheap to me.\u201d Dr John McKinley, a senior lecturer in environmental engineering at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, also raised doubts. \u201cLike a lot of infrastructure questions, a bridge or tunnel across the Irish Sea is feasible engineering but dubious economics,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea has been floating around since the 1880s and seems to come around every 30 to 40 years. The shortest distance would connect Northern Ireland and Scotland, but that involves going through Beaufort\u2019s Dyke, a 200- to 300-metre deep channel in the middle of the Irish Sea. \u201cFor a bridge, you would need support piers more or less equal in size to the largest civil engineers have built so far. For a tunnel the underwater part would either be about three times the length of that for the Channel tunnel or go about four times as deep. Connecting Belfast to Glasgow, lovely places though I think they both are, isn\u2019t as obviously a good thing as connecting London to Paris.\u201d David Barwell, the UK and Ireland CEO of AECOM \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest engineering firms \u2013 said: \u201cEngineers, we can come up with any which way you want to get something like this done. You can do it \u2026 there would be an engineering solution. I think the next piece, the other piece which people are asking is, \u2018OK, well there\u2019s an engineering solution, but at what cost?\u2019\u201d Asked whether he thought the project could be completed for \u00a315bn, he said: \u201cI really don\u2019t know. The problem is, it\u2019s always dangerous talking numbers at an early stage in the project.\u201d A government spokeswoman said: \u201cThe prime minister has often spoken about his support for infrastructure projects that increase connectivity for people and particularly those that strengthen the union. As you\u2019d expect, the government regularly commissions work to examine the feasibility of potential projects.\u201d",

That scramble to the summit was completed when Nketiah was sent crashing in the area by Aapo Halme and, once the scoring substitute had lost an argument with Mateusz Klich over who would take the resultant penalty, the Pole\u2019s low kick put the outcome beyond doubt. \u201cWe could have lost but I think everybody who saw the game will have enjoyed it,\u201d said Bielsa, who, nonetheless, was unimpressed by skirmishes between rival Yorkshire fans necessitating police intervention.</p> <p>The southbound M1 had earlier been filled with supporters making the 23\u2011mile drive from Leeds.

Admittedly, Bamford tested the sharpness of Collins\u2019s reflexes a couple of times in the first half while Jack Harrison struck a post from close range but it was all a bit hit and hope.</p> <p>Perhaps significantly those two Bamford chances were created by Jamie Shackleton. A surprise inclusion in the Leeds starting XI, the attacking midfielder faded a little after the break but proved the standout performer of an end-to-end opening 45 minutes enhanced by his creative dynamism and eye for a pass.</p> <p>\u201cShackleton was very good,\u201d said Bielsa, who replaced Harrison with H\u00e9lder Costa at the interval. Almost immediately the newcomer\u2019s left-wing advance and cross left a stretching Bamford to slide the ball in the back of the net only for that effort to be disallowed for offside. By then Casilla had somehow tipped Jacob Brown\u2019s arcing shot over his bar and the sense that no one was really in control heightened as Wilks\u2019s rapid change of pace sent him surging beyond a couple of markers before, once again, stretching the keeper to the limit.</p> <p>The moment had come for Bielsa to liberate Nketiah from the bench and the Arsenal loanee was greeted by a loud cheer from the away end. \u201cEddie\u2019s got goals in him,\u201d Bielsa said. \u201cHe\u2019s a complete player.\u201d</p> <p>His contribution left Stendel sanguine. \u201cI\u2019m proud of our performance,\u201d said Barnsley\u2019s manager. \u201cWe defended high, we played with courage and we deserved at least a point but we didn\u2019t take our chances.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Arsenal held a series of discreet interviews this summer with applicants, from home and abroad, asked to present in-depth pitches as to why their club would provide the right temporary home for Eddie Nketiah. Perhaps thanks partly to the relationship between Victor Orta, the Leeds director of football, and Unai Emery, Arsenal\u2019s manager, the Yorkshire club won the competition to take the 20-year-old striker on a season\u2011long loan and on Sunday Nketiah once again reminded everyone what the fuss was about. Shortly after replacing a frustrated Patrick Bamford, the England Under\u201121 international connected with a fine, curling 84th\u2011minute free\u2011kick from the excellent Kalvin Phillips at the far post and volleyed it ruthlessly beyond Brad Collins. As he acknowledged the travelling fans with a military-style salute and was rewarded with chants of \u201cEddie, Eddie, Eddie\u201d, Nketiah succeeded in adding a gloss finish to a hitherto incoherent, if exciting, Leeds performance which a high-pressing Barnsley could conceivably have ended up winning. Instead the visitors were destined to go top of the Championship, moving ahead of Swansea on goal difference. That scramble to the summit was completed when Nketiah was sent crashing in the area by Aapo Halme and, once the scoring substitute had lost an argument with Mateusz Klich over who would take the resultant penalty, the Pole\u2019s low kick put the outcome beyond doubt. \u201cWe could have lost but I think everybody who saw the game will have enjoyed it,\u201d said Bielsa, who, nonetheless, was unimpressed by skirmishes between rival Yorkshire fans necessitating police intervention. The southbound M1 had earlier been filled with supporters making the 23\u2011mile drive from Leeds. After temporarily colonising Woolley Edge services en route, that travelling army announced their arrival in Barnsley with incessant choruses of \u201cMarching on Together\u201d\u201a leaving neutrals to fathom out Bielsa\u2019s latest formational twist. Broadly a 4-1-4-1 configuration designed to frequently morph into the Leeds manager\u2019s hallmark 3-3-1-3, it may not have been quite as startling as the visitors\u2019 shocking pink and grey away kit but still left Daniel Stendel\u2019s players initially struggling to get to grips with Bielsa\u2019s beloved positional interchanging. The problem for the Leeds players was that they were able to exercise so much freedom of movement within that flexible framework that, at times, their gameplan seemed too flimsily structured and their play assumed a chaotic, almost kamikaze, edge. Indeed, only smart saves on the part of Kiko Casilla prevented Luke Thomas and then Mallik Wilks \u2013 a highly motivated Elland Road old boy \u2013 from shooting Barnsley into the lead. Admittedly, Bamford tested the sharpness of Collins\u2019s reflexes a couple of times in the first half while Jack Harrison struck a post from close range but it was all a bit hit and hope. Perhaps significantly those two Bamford chances were created by Jamie Shackleton. A surprise inclusion in the Leeds starting XI, the attacking midfielder faded a little after the break but proved the standout performer of an end-to-end opening 45 minutes enhanced by his creative dynamism and eye for a pass. \u201cShackleton was very good,\u201d said Bielsa, who replaced Harrison with H\u00e9lder Costa at the interval. Almost immediately the newcomer\u2019s left-wing advance and cross left a stretching Bamford to slide the ball in the back of the net only for that effort to be disallowed for offside. By then Casilla had somehow tipped Jacob Brown\u2019s arcing shot over his bar and the sense that no one was really in control heightened as Wilks\u2019s rapid change of pace sent him surging beyond a couple of markers before, once again, stretching the keeper to the limit. The moment had come for Bielsa to liberate Nketiah from the bench and the Arsenal loanee was greeted by a loud cheer from the away end. \u201cEddie\u2019s got goals in him,\u201d Bielsa said. \u201cHe\u2019s a complete player.\u201d His contribution left Stendel sanguine. \u201cI\u2019m proud of our performance,\u201d said Barnsley\u2019s manager. \u201cWe defended high, we played with courage and we deserved at least a point but we didn\u2019t take our chances.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats have overwhelmingly approved the party\u2019s plan of going into an election with the promise to revoke Brexit without a referendum, despite warnings from delegates at their annual conference in Bournemouth that it risked alienating some voters. Under the plan, the Lib Dems would still support a second Brexit referendum with an option of remain, but going into an election would promise to revoke article 50 if the party won an absolute majority \u2013 which is seen as highly unlikely. The move comes after the party gained another new MP as the former Conservative universities minister Sam Gyimah, one of the 21 Tories ejected from the party for rebelling in a Commons vote, announced he was joining the Lib Dems. Speaking earlier, the party\u2019s leader, Jo Swinson, said the policy would allow the Lib Dems to be \u201cstraightforward with people in an election\u201d, and that it would be odd for a Lib Dem government to be obliged to negotiate a Brexit deal it did not support just to put it to a referendum. Among a number of speakers at the conference who backed the policy, saying it would give the party a distinctive edge in an election, was Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP-turned-Lib Dem, who told delegates it would reinforce the party\u2019s \u201cunequivocal\u201d message on Brexit. But Niall Hodson, a Lib Dem councillor in Sunderland, which voted heavily for Brexit, warned the strategy could be seen as absolutist and seemed to be aimed at \u201cpiling up more and more remain votes in London\u201d rather than expanding the party into new areas. Tom Brake, the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman in the Commons who formally proposed the idea, said a clear message was necessary. \u201cWe will put an end there and then to the Brexit nightmare that is dragging the country down and tearing us apart,\u201d he said. The conference is taking place amid a buoyant mood for the Lib Dems, who are celebrating record membership and a series of new MPs. As well as Umunna, his fellow ex-Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Angela Smith have joined in recent weeks, along with the former Tories Phillip Lee and Sarah Wollaston, and the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection winner, Jane Dodds. In a question-and-answer session with party activists, Swinson was heckled by one member over the arrival of Lee, who as a Tory MP argued immigrants should show they do not have HIV or hepatitis B before being allowed into the UK. As she discussed Lee\u2019s switch of party a Lib Dem councillor in Chelmsford, Catherine Finnecy, shouted that Swinson was supporting a \u201cUkip policy\u201d due to Lee\u2019s views. Asked about the new Brexit policy \u2013 first revealed in the Guardian \u2013 Swinson said there had to be clarity over the issue. She told BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cAs Liberal Democrats we have argued that a specific Brexit deal should be put to a people\u2019s vote to give clarity. But if we end up at a general election then I think we need to be straightforward with people and give them an option for all this Brexit chaos to stop. \u201cBut if instead we find ourselves in an election it would be bizarre for us to suggest that the main issue of that election will be anything other than Brexit.\u201d Swinson, who has ruled out working with either Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson after an election, said: \u201cI think people want politicians to be straightforward with where they stand.

The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.</p>\n    <p>Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.</p>\n    <p>Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.</p>\n    <p>If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey\"><b>Daniel Boffey</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>EU officials hope the meeting will create momentum towards an agreement.

But EU officials involved in talks with Johnson\u2019s envoy, David Frost, have dismissed his upbeat account. \u201cNo, in fact people are a bit dismayed,\u201d said one EU source, describing the mood after the latest talks. \u201cI am not even going to call them negotiations \u2013 the last session on Friday did start touching on content \u2013 that\u2019s actually quite a step forward \u2026 but we still should have been there a long time ago and [an end result] is still quite far away.\u201d The lunch meeting with Juncker comes 26 days after Johnson met Angela Merkel in Berlin and declared he had 30 days to persuade the EU there was a viable alternative to the backstop. That meeting in Berlin, followed by others with EU leaders in Paris and Biarritz, raised hopes that the prime minister was serious about a deal. But optimism in Brussels rapidly dissipated, after Johnson prorogued parliament and stepped up his no-deal rhetoric, while failing to put any proposals on paper. A spate of recent reports from London analysts that a deal was becoming more likely were dismissed as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d by one senior EU official. Johnson\u2019s latest rhetorical fancy \u2013 that, like the Incredible Hulk, the UK would break out of its \u201cmanacles\u201d on 31 October \u2013 has further fuelled EU scepticism about his sincerity. Describing the language as \u201cnot very surprising\u201d, the EU source said: \u201cIt all makes it look like it\u2019s a bit of a joke. We are talking about something extremely serious. The consequences of no deal will be extremely serious and it looks like this is being treated as a game in which you are the hero sort of story rather than [dealing] with real lives.\u201d Juncker said a no-deal Brexit would be a mess and take years to resolve. Speaking to Deutschlandfunk, he said patriots in the UK \u201cwould not wish your country such a fate\u201d. He said the EU knew what the British did not want, but were still waiting for alternative backstop proposals: \u201cI hope we can get them, but time is running out.\u201d EU officials hope the meeting will create momentum towards an agreement. The outgoing commission president is not involved in day-to-day Brexit talks, but has intervened at crisis points. In March, for example, he tried to help Theresa May sell the deal to Conservative backbenchers, with pledges that the EU did not want to trap the UK in the backstop. The backstop, a fallback plan for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, continues to keep both sides at loggerheads. Johnson is adamant the backstop must go, while the EU insists any exit agreement must contain the backstop or a legally watertight equivalent. In Friday\u2019s talks, Frost outlined ideas for an all-Ireland regulatory regime for food and agriculture, which Downing Street thinks would go a long way to replacing the backstop. Brussels thinks these ideas fall far short of what is required to protect European markets from dangerous goods, fraud or unfair competition. EU officials say food safety, animal, plant and health measures cannot be separated from customs, because otherwise no one would know what is entering European markets.

However, officials see some positive steps: they think the UK has agreed to \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d on food and agriculture, meaning Northern Ireland would automatically accept updates to the EU rulebook in these areas. With time running short to resolve highly technical issues that touch on sensitive political questions, the EU is also uncertain whether Johnson can get a Commons majority for a deal. The Johnson government has a \u201ccredibility problem\u201d over whether it could get a revised agreement passed in the Commons, one EU diplomat said. \u201cWhat kind of mandate does Mr Johnson have?

As a 12-year-old child he had been abused when using public toilets in the town centre. In the following months, he was subject to a series of sexual assaults by a group of men.</p> <p>He told how he subsequently attempted suicide several times, suffered from mental health problems and turned to drink and drugs. In 2016, he said he summoned the courage to make a statement to the police.

Carried in on a velvet sedan by six topless men, clad in a golden jewelled catsuit accessorised with 10-foot wings and a 24-carat headpiece, it was an entrance unlikely to be forgotten.

You know, everything is \u2018the gr-eatest of all!\u2019\u201d he says in ringmaster style. While the positive reactions are nice, he has given up caring what other people think of him. He cites <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/colin-kaepernick\" title=\"\">Colin Kaepernick</a>, the NFL star who knelt during the US national anthem to protest about racial injustice: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to risk yourself in order to make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>Porter\u2019s current state of liberation has been a lifelong journey. He discovered style as a boy at church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (\u201ca fashion show from head to toe\u201d) and his grandmother would get patterns and make \u201camazing\u201d dresses. Other childhood memories are not so happy \u2013 last year <a href=\"https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2018/10/31/pose-star-billy-porter-reveals-past-sexual-abuse-searing-op-ed\" title=\"\">he wrote about</a> being sexually abused by his stepfather \u2013 but after a lot of work, he says, he has learned to love himself \u201cunconditionally\u201d.</p> <p>If it\u2019s Pray Tell for which a new generation knows him, it was playing cabaret star and drag queen Lola in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNYGD1uyV9k\" title=\"\">Kinky Boots on Broadway</a> from 2013 that kickstarted his journey to red carpet activism. \u201cIt\u2019s the archetype I ran away from for the first 25 years of my career \u2013 I was told my gayness was my liability.\u201d Putting on Lola\u2019s red thigh-high boots made him feel masculine and powerful. It also won him a Tony and a Grammy.</p> <p>Porter in 2019 is on a roll. Living in Harlem with husband <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thesmithsociety/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Adam Porter-Smith</a>, co-owner of eyewear company <a href=\"https://nativeken.com/\" title=\"\">Native Ken</a>, he\u2019s making music, has a book deal and is <a href=\"https://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/2019-2020/the-purists/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImsy7vKL94wIVx7HtCh0inA3lEAAYASAAEgIf3_D_BwE\" title=\"\">directing a play</a>.

His move away from the traditional suits for men on the red carpet was entirely conscious. When his manager aired doubts, Porter ignored him. \u201cIf they want to judge me because of what I\u2019m wearing, I don\u2019t want to work with them. Let\u2019s flip it,\u201d he says. How does it feel to be getting such positive reactions? \u201cI was like, \u2018I should have put this dress on 20 years ago,\u2019\u201d he laughs.</p> <p>Perhaps this vindication is down to a serious point behind his style revolution: a desire to \u201cbe present for the younger generation, so I can help them\u201d \u2013 a theme that is echoed in series two of Pose. Until recently, he felt marginalised \u2013 but he refused to let it silence him. Instead \u201cit made me louder and more aggressive in making sure I am heard.

As he stood, statuesque, in tailored jacket over full-skirted dress, he wasn\u2019t just enjoying his moment in front of the world\u2019s press. In fact this went beyond the Oscars, the red carpet or even fashion. Porter was releasing himself from the constraints of conventional gender expectations \u2013 and sparking a discussion about what it means for the rest of us, too. \u201cI\u2019m not a drag queen,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI\u2019m a man in a dress.\u201d Six months later, Porter reflects on the reaction \u2013 which saw images of him shared around the world, and a bump in his fashion profile.

That\u2019s because his outfits transcend trends: a red and pink number for the Tony awards was designed to resemble a uterus, to draw attention to reproductive rights, while his show-stopping sun god look for the Met ball celebrated camp as \u201cone of the highest forms of fashion and art\u201d. Pose is also breaking new ground. It shines a spotlight on New York\u2019s underground ball culture of the 80s and early 90s, seen in cult 1990 documentary Paris Is Burning, where \u201chouses\u201d of mostly trans and gay young people of colour and compete in voguing competitions and drag categories. Pose fictionalises this world (\u201cOur version is a little glossier, but the energy: verbatim,\u201d Porter says), following the lives of members of rival houses Abundance and Evangelista. It brings the scene to a new generation and an inclusivity to mainstream TV. According to creators FX, the show stars the biggest LGBTQ recurring cast ever in a scripted series and the most transgender actors in regular roles in TV show history. Porter plays the sharp-tongued ballroom emcee Pray Tell whose voice drawls the show\u2019s catchphrase: \u201cAnd the category is\u2026\u201d Pray Tell is the grounding influence, the fatherly figure to the younger characters. While at the house of Evangelista for dinner, he corrects young dancer Damon, played by Ryan Jamaal Swain: \u201cOregano is an herb, not a vegetable, darling boy. Who is educating these children on their nutrition?\u201d With writing like that, plus grade A outfits, it\u2019s compulsive viewing, attracting two Golden Globe nominations, including best actor for Porter, and a loyal base of obsessed fans, including his 849k Instagram followers.

He vetoed that (too many outfit changes) but referenced Ross\u2019s ancient Egyptian look, with help from New York brand the Blonds and his stylist Sam Ratelle, in what Vogue declared \u201cthe most fabulous entrance in Met Gala history\u201d. High praise when you think of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s latex look, Rihanna\u2019s \u201comelette dress\u201d or Kim Kardashian\u2019s feathered naked gown. On mention of the Vogue headline, though, Porter bursts into gravelly laughter. \u201cI think we as a culture are prone to hyperbole. You know, everything is \u2018the gr-eatest of all!\u2019\u201d he says in ringmaster style. While the positive reactions are nice, he has given up caring what other people think of him. He cites Colin Kaepernick, the NFL star who knelt during the US national anthem to protest about racial injustice: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to risk yourself in order to make a difference.\u201d Porter\u2019s current state of liberation has been a lifelong journey. He discovered style as a boy at church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (\u201ca fashion show from head to toe\u201d) and his grandmother would get patterns and make \u201camazing\u201d dresses. Other childhood memories are not so happy \u2013 last year he wrote about being sexually abused by his stepfather \u2013 but after a lot of work, he says, he has learned to love himself \u201cunconditionally\u201d. If it\u2019s Pray Tell for which a new generation knows him, it was playing cabaret star and drag queen Lola in Kinky Boots on Broadway from 2013 that kickstarted his journey to red carpet activism. \u201cIt\u2019s the archetype I ran away from for the first 25 years of my career \u2013 I was told my gayness was my liability.\u201d Putting on Lola\u2019s red thigh-high boots made him feel masculine and powerful. It also won him a Tony and a Grammy. Porter in 2019 is on a roll. Living in Harlem with husband Adam Porter-Smith, co-owner of eyewear company Native Ken, he\u2019s making music, has a book deal and is directing a play. Next up? Ambitions for a creative empire like Oprah\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m not putting no limits on it,\u201d he says. Porter adores fashion \u2013 from Rick Owens\u2019 androgynous styles, to newer designers Palomo Spain and Wooyoungmi, as well as Valentino, Gucci and Prada. His move away from the traditional suits for men on the red carpet was entirely conscious. When his manager aired doubts, Porter ignored him. \u201cIf they want to judge me because of what I\u2019m wearing, I don\u2019t want to work with them. Let\u2019s flip it,\u201d he says. How does it feel to be getting such positive reactions? \u201cI was like, \u2018I should have put this dress on 20 years ago,\u2019\u201d he laughs. Perhaps this vindication is down to a serious point behind his style revolution: a desire to \u201cbe present for the younger generation, so I can help them\u201d \u2013 a theme that is echoed in series two of Pose. Until recently, he felt marginalised \u2013 but he refused to let it silence him. Instead \u201cit made me louder and more aggressive in making sure I am heard. Because we all are human beings that deserve a space in this world.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2017 to more fully describe the scene and characters depicted in Paris is Burning and fictionalised in the TV series Pose. \u2022 Series two of Pose is on BBC Two in October. How to be more Billy When in doubt, just add gold From brooches and jumpsuits to the full-on set of golden wings Porter wore to the Met ball, going for gold always brings glamour. Accessorise with golden interiors where possible. The devil is in the detail Porter\u2019s outfits are all about big impact. But the little things still matter. See statement rings, a hint of a silk glove, or the blue lipstick he wore to WorldPride\u2019s celebrations in New York. Suit up Breaking down gender norms is integral to Porter\u2019s style \u2013 but that needn\u2019t mean shying away from the classics. From a waistcoat at the Tonys to a tux at the Oscars, looking sharp in a suit is a solid starting block. You can leave your hat on A skill perfected during Porter\u2019s role as Pose emcee Pray Tell. The bigger and bolder, the better: sailor caps, top hats and even a pale pink stetson have all featured. Make a scene Don\u2019t be afraid to take up space. Porter is about making a statement in style. At London\u2019s Pride, he wore the rainbow flag, reimagined in tulle.",

The 32-year-old striker timed his run to perfection to head Kadeem Harris\u2019 cross past the helpless Terriers goalkeeper Kamil Grabara.</p> <p>Huddersfield fought back, with Terence Kongolo volleying over after a one-two with Fraizer Campbell, and then testing Kieren Westwood with a stinging drive. Jacob Murphy, on loan from Newcastle, then missed a chance to double Wednesday\u2019s lead before the break.</p> <p>Cowley brought on Isaac Mbenza and Juninho Bacuna at half-time, with the latter setting up Kongolo with a cross \u2013 only for the defender to be denied by Westwood again. Campbell failed to test the Wednesday keeper from an Adama Diakhaby cross, before Adam Reach went close at the other end.</p> <p>Winnall then settled the game with 18 minutes remaining, glancing in a header from skipper Barry Bannan\u2019s delightful cross for his first goal for the Owls in more than two years. The visitors threatened a third late on, but ran out comfortable winners. <strong>PA</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7e34b98f08f30dc5bbbb1e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T12:56:11.278Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Garry Monk won the battle of the new two new Yorkshire managers as Sheffield Wednesday beat Huddersfield 2-0 at the John Smith\u2019s Stadium. Steven Fletcher\u2019s 10th-minute header and a rare goal from substitute Sam Winnall proved the difference between the two sides as Danny Cowley who, along with his brother and assistant Nicky, suffered defeat in their first outing at the Huddersfield helm. Both sides created good chances, but it was Fletcher who gave the Owls the lead with his fourth goal in six games. The 32-year-old striker timed his run to perfection to head Kadeem Harris\u2019 cross past the helpless Terriers goalkeeper Kamil Grabara. Huddersfield fought back, with Terence Kongolo volleying over after a one-two with Fraizer Campbell, and then testing Kieren Westwood with a stinging drive. Jacob Murphy, on loan from Newcastle, then missed a chance to double Wednesday\u2019s lead before the break. Cowley brought on Isaac Mbenza and Juninho Bacuna at half-time, with the latter setting up Kongolo with a cross \u2013 only for the defender to be denied by Westwood again. Campbell failed to test the Wednesday keeper from an Adama Diakhaby cross, before Adam Reach went close at the other end. Winnall then settled the game with 18 minutes remaining, glancing in a header from skipper Barry Bannan\u2019s delightful cross for his first goal for the Owls in more than two years. The visitors threatened a third late on, but ran out comfortable winners. PA That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog. The win moves Sheffield Wednesday up to ninth, only a couple of points off the automatic promotion places. Huddersfield stay in 21st. Thanks for your company - bye! Still want more? Peep peep! Garry Monk starts his spell as Sheffield Wednesday manager with an ultimately comfortable victory, thanks to two accomplished headers from Steven Fletcher and Sam Winnall. Huddersfield were willing but looked short on quality and especially confidence. The Cowley brothers will need a bit of time to improve things. 90+2 min Nuhiu and Bacuna have a bit of a shoving match on the touchline. Nothing to see here. 90 min Four minutes of added time. 89 min \u201cOne final thought,\u201d says Joe Ludlam. \u201cImagine what Adthe Nuhiu would have done to England\u2019s defence if Kosovo had brought him off the bench...\u201d He is an appreciable unit. 87 min Winnall\u2019s shot goes behind off a defender. It was very hard work for 72 minutes, but since the second goal Wednesday have been cruising. 86 min Kieran Lee replaces the impressive Kadeem Harris, who had a hand in both goals. 85 min Nuhiu limbers into the area and finds Winnall, who blasts the bouncing ball over the bar on the turn. 83 min Huddersfield\u2019s heads have gone down since the second goal, which is understandable if not ideal. 82 min Another Wednesday change: Atdhe Nuhiu replaces the goalscorer Steven Fletcher. 79 min Huddersfield suddenly look so vulnerable to the counter-attack. Winnall, in a criminal amount of space just past the halfway line. slices the defence open with a beautiful pass to the left-back Palmer. He surges into the area and slips a low cross that just evades the sliding Fletcher in front of an open goal. Fletcher is then booked for something or other. 77 min This could get worse for Huddersfield. Wednesday break down the left through Winnall, who picks out Reach on the edge of the box. He has time to take a touch and smack a shot that deflects wide off Hogg. Before the corner is taken, Huddersfield bring on Steve Mounie for the impressive Fraizer Campbell. 74 min It\u2019s been a bit of a mugging, in that Huddersfield have dominated possession throughout, but the two Wednesday goals were excellent. That\u2019s another really good goal. Harris drew two defenders towards him and played the ball back to Bannan, who curled a beautiful first-time ball towards the six-yard line. It was perfect for the substitute Sam Winnall, who got between the centre-halves and flicked an accomplished header in off the far post. 71 min \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve looked inspired going forward since about 1998,\u201d says Joe Ludlam, \u201cand after a year of Jos Luhakay\u2019s \u2018everyone a centre-half\u2019 philosophy I\u2019ll take any hint of positive intent. I do worry about loading good players into the middle when they\u2019re more effective elsewhere (Reach is best on the wing, Hutchinson less likely to get sent off at the back) but hopefully Monk will have the confidence to address this as the season progresses.\u201d 70 min Borner is booked for taking a shortcut through the back of Campbell. 69 min Hutchinson has hurt his left knee after landing awkwardly. He\u2019s going to try to continue. 68 min Hadergjonaj is booked for a foul on Harris, who has given him a difficult afternoon. 66 min That was a really good chance for Reach. Harris zoomed into the area and picked out Reach in space on the edge of the area. He took the short first time, but it was a tame strike and too close to Grabara. 63 min Chalobah is booked for a high foot on Borner. I\u2019m not even sure it was a foul. 61 min Hadergjonaj\u2019s low cross ricochets right across the face of goal. Huddersfield look more threatening since that double substitution. 60 min Reach wriggles away from Hogg on the edge of the area and hits a shot on the turn that goes just wide. Grabara had it covered. Moments later, Wednesday make their first change, with Sam Winnall replacing Murphy. 57 min: Good save from Westwood! Bacuna forced his way past Odubajo on the left and cut the ball back towards Kongolo on the edge of the area. He took the shot first time, sweeping it low towards the near post, and Westwood got down to his right to make a smart save. 56 min Huddersfield make a double change, with Juninho Bacuna and Isaac Mbenza replacing Diakhaby and O\u2019Brien. 55 min Hutchinson is booked for repeat offending. 52 min Hutchinson\u2019s tame shot from 25 yards dribbles well wide. 50 min \u201cNot the greatest half of football ever played,\u201d says Paolo. \u201cBased on it, both new managers have a job on their hands.\u201d 49 min At the other end, Campbell\u2019s volley is too close to Westwood. He\u2019s looked very sharp. 48 min I don\u2019t think that was a penalty. He was bumped a bit by Schindler, but I don\u2019t think there was enough for a foul. I\u2019d like to see it again though because he may have been sandwiched by Schindler and Hogg. 47 min Wednesday have a big penalty appeal turned down. Murphy played a smart one-two with Fletcher and went down after a challenge from the side. The referee wasn\u2019t interested. We haven\u2019t seen a replay yet. 47 min \u201cThe Cowley brothers\u2019 arrival has certainly felt positive,\u201d says Paul Townend. \u201cThe message boards and threads had got incredibly despondent, not an unknown trait in Huddersfield. Amazing to think they already have more wins at the John Smith than the previous manager!\u201d 46 min Peep peep! Sheffield Wednesday get the second half under way. Half-time reading \u201c(Early) afternoon Rob, from a Wednesday fan,\u201d says Joe Ludlam. \u201cThe 4-5-1 formation has looked very negative at Hillsborough - we\u2019ve had the players to make it work but a succession of defensive managers have used the central three to protect rather than control. It\u2019s refreshing to see the players given a bit more licence going forward today, especially the wingers. Hopefully Monk will bring back the optimism we felt so briefly under Steve Bruce. That said, I still wish I was watching the cricket.\u201d It\u2019s been more of a 4-4-2 today, which Garry Monk has often used during his career. They\u2019ve been a bit uninspired going forward, although that\u2019s partly because they had a lead to protect for most of the half. And it was a very good goal. Peep peep! Wednesday lead through Steven Fletcher\u2019s accomplished early goal. That aside it\u2019s been a pretty scruffy game, although Huddersfield in particular have been full of good intentions. 44 min Murphy spanks wide from 25 yards. 41 min Wednesday haven\u2019t offered much going forward, apart from that fine early goal. They seem happy enough to sit on their lead and see what Huddersfield have got. 37 min This is better from Huddersfield. Grant beats a couple of players and angles a lofted cross towards the far post, where Hadergjonaj heads the ball tamely into the arms of Westwood. I think he was trying to steer it towards Campbell, who was in space to his left. 35 min Kongolo moves infield from the left and hits a stinging right-footed shot from the edge of the box that Westwood can\u2019t hold. Happily for him, it rebounds to safety. 31 min It\u2019s been a blue-collar match so far. Bannan has shown the usual touches of class, but the effort:quality ratio leaves a little to be desired. 27 min Grant\u2019s corner is headed away as far as Hogg, who slashes over the bar from 25 yards. 26 min Grant goes on a lovely run from the left, beating Odubajo and then Iorfa before Odubajo makes a good recovery challenge on the edge of the area. 22 min I think the Cowley brothers will be pretty happy with Huddersfield\u2019s start. They\u2019ve been bright and breezy in possession, Campbell in particular, and are a little unfortunate to be behind. 20 min The lively Campbell beats Hutchinson with a lovely piece of skill and plays the ball wide towards Hadergjonaj. He has options in the middle ... and sidefoots his cross straight at the keeper Westwood. 19 min \u201cSigns of a fresh approach already for Huddersfield,\u201d says Jerry Strachan. \u201cStarting 12 men may prove to be a masterstroke. Playing Hogg twice in the same match is inspired.\u201d Ach, thanks for pointing it out \u2013 I\u2019ll change it. 18 min Anyone out there? 16 min Good play from Kongolo. He marches forwards from left-back, plays a one-two with Campbell and volleys over the bar on the stretch. 14 min Campbell tries to get Huddersfield going again with a lively tackle on Hutchinson. Bannan then takes Hogg out, increasing the temperature some more. 11 min That was such good play from Kadeem Harris, who beat his man with ease and then delivered a fine cross. That\u2019s an excellent goal. After a long passing move from Wednesday, Bannan finds Harris on the left. He surges towards the byline, beating Hadergjonaj easily with a stepover before standing up a lovely cross. Fletcher towers over Elphick in the six-yard box to thump a header into the net. 8 min Huddersfield win the first corner of the match, on the right. Grant curls it in, and there\u2019s a foul on a Wednesday defender. 6 min At the other end, Chalobah sidefoots a low shot from 25 yards that is comfortably held by Westwood, sprawling to his left. 5 min A long goalkick from Westwood is headed down by Fletcher to Reach, who knees the ball up and hits a volley that goes straight at Grabara from 20 yards. He didn\u2019t really get hold of it. 4 min The Wednesday right-back Odubajo takes one in the personal space, prompting much mirth in the commentary box. 3 min A slow start, with both teams having a look at each other. 1 min Peep peep! Huddersfield, in blue and white stripes, kick off from right to left. Sheffield Wednesday are in their green change strip. The players emerge, looking ready for action. Danny Cowley and Garry Monk shake hands warmly in the tunnel. For all concerned, a new era is about to begin. And here\u2019s Garry Monk \u201cIt\u2019s been a good week. I\u2019ve had so much support and a really good welcome. It\u2019s only been a short period with the players but we\u2019ve tried to do some good work without being overbearing. It\u2019s a really good group - very motivated and positive - and it\u2019s been difficult to leave people out. \u201cThis is a huge, historic club. I got a sense of that when I had a loan spell here. It\u2019s our job to fight for that, and hopefully we can start well today.\u201d Danny Cowley\u2019s pre-match thoughts \u201cIt\u2019s been a really good week - a bit of a whirlwind, but it\u2019s been great to meet the people of Huddersfield: the players, the staff and some of the supporters. At this stage we\u2019re trying to get to know the players as people, and once you do that you can start to build respect and trust, and then hopefully we can start to affect them. We\u2019ve got no Alex Pritchard, who hasn\u2019t been able to train We\u2019ve picked a team we feel can be successful on the day.\u201d Huddersfield (4-2-3-1) Grabara; Hadergjonaj, Elphick, Schindler, Kongolo; Hogg, Chalobah; Diakhaby, O\u2019Brien, Grant; Campbell. Substitutes: Schofield, Bacuna, Kachunga, Mbenza, Mounie, Stankovic, J Brown. Sheffield Wednesday (4-4-2) Westwood; Odubajo, Iorfa, Borner, Palmer; Murphy, Hutchinson, Bannan, Harris; Fletcher, Reach. Substitutes: Dawson, Fox, Lee, Winnall, Nuhiu, Luongo, Bates.

      "body": "<p>When Printworks opened to much hurrah two years ago, it did so during a run of venue closures in London. It\u2019s aesthetically impressive and has quickly become one of the best venues for large-scale electronic events, and so is ripe for an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/28/aphex-twin-best-songs-ranked\">Aphex Twin</a> brain-tickle \u2013 even if free earplugs, sadly, aren\u2019t on offer tonight. Although the musician has never relied on album cycles to draw in new audiences, it is striking how young the audience winding through Printworks is.</p> <p>As well as releasing around a dozen EPs in the past decade on his own label, Rephlex, and Warp, there was mass excitement about Richard David James\u2019s \u201creturn\u201d as an album artist in 2014, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/18/aphex-twin-syro-review-brain-bending-richard-d-james\">Grammy award-winning Syro</a> \u2013 and the memorable flight of a neon-green blimp bearing the Aphex Twin logo over London. Along with the weight of his back catalogue and mythical status, what makes shows such as these sell out in minutes is<strong> </strong>Aphex Twin\u2019s<strong> </strong>love of spectacle and keen support for new electronic artists. The former is a perfect fit for this, the Red Bull music festival\u2019s high concept (and budget). In terms of the latter, he\u2019s viewed as a switched-on father figure to younger artists and fans, his hybrid set blending new club tracks with live modular jams, his own music, and ripe selections of 90s UK hardcore.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"31a1e278bee8c7ff7559860ad4107974090f24cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31a1e278bee8c7ff7559860ad4107974090f24cc/0_0_6670_4447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"20191409 RBM Festival Aphex Twin Andrew Whitton RB-008\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Light fantastic \u2026 Aphex Twin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Whitton/Fanatic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The support acts \u2013 Italian electronic minimalist Caterina Barbieri, Ugandan percussion group Nihiloxica, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/12/the-months-best-mixes-eris-drew-afrodeutsche-sharda\">Manchester electro producer and DJ Afrodeutsche </a>\u2013 are all excellent, but Nihiloxica stand out.

The show has been custom built with collaborator Weirdcore \u2013 306 motorised LED screens are staggered on stage and above heads, and move throughout the performance. Cameras film the crowd and images of dancers are digitally manipulated so that logos and manic depictions of Aphex Twin appear on their projected images.

The lasers are, bluntly, crazy, an impressive sensory assault. It\u2019s unabashed fun, strangers craning their necks and grinning at each other.</p> <p>Musically, Aphex Twin is on top form, manoeuvring at breakneck speed through genre-melting sounds. Heaving polyrhythmic techno tracks fold into industrial electro pumpers, thundering piano loops and buzzsaw jungle breaks. There are flashes of the past \u2013 the Future Sounds of London\u2019s Pulse State, the Octagon Man\u2019s Free-er Than Free, and D-Shake\u2019s Techno Trance (Paradise Is Now) capture that 90s UK hardcore euphoria \u2013 and nods to the future, with Egyptian producer Zuli\u2019s Trigger Finger and HVL\u2019s Sallow Myth. For Aphex Twin\u2019s own music, there\u2019s the hiss and funk of 2017\u2019s T16.5 MADMA with nastya+5.2 and aquatic bleeps of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nRsbS8_hc4\">2015\u2019s umil 25-01</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/28/aphex-twin-best-songs-ranked\">Aphex Twin's best songs \u2013 ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the sweetest moment comes in the latter movements of the set.

      "bodyText": "When Printworks opened to much hurrah two years ago, it did so during a run of venue closures in London. It\u2019s aesthetically impressive and has quickly become one of the best venues for large-scale electronic events, and so is ripe for an Aphex Twin brain-tickle \u2013 even if free earplugs, sadly, aren\u2019t on offer tonight. Although the musician has never relied on album cycles to draw in new audiences, it is striking how young the audience winding through Printworks is. As well as releasing around a dozen EPs in the past decade on his own label, Rephlex, and Warp, there was mass excitement about Richard David James\u2019s \u201creturn\u201d as an album artist in 2014, with the Grammy award-winning Syro \u2013 and the memorable flight of a neon-green blimp bearing the Aphex Twin logo over London. Along with the weight of his back catalogue and mythical status, what makes shows such as these sell out in minutes is Aphex Twin\u2019s love of spectacle and keen support for new electronic artists. The former is a perfect fit for this, the Red Bull music festival\u2019s high concept (and budget). In terms of the latter, he\u2019s viewed as a switched-on father figure to younger artists and fans, his hybrid set blending new club tracks with live modular jams, his own music, and ripe selections of 90s UK hardcore. The support acts \u2013 Italian electronic minimalist Caterina Barbieri, Ugandan percussion group Nihiloxica, and Manchester electro producer and DJ Afrodeutsche \u2013 are all excellent, but Nihiloxica stand out. Part of experimental Kampala label Nyege Nyege Tapes, the group blends Bugandan drumming with a kit player, analogue synthesisers and multilayered vocalisations to twisted effect. When it goes quiet for Aphex Twin, the long concrete room floods with an intense light. The show has been custom built with collaborator Weirdcore \u2013 306 motorised LED screens are staggered on stage and above heads, and move throughout the performance. Cameras film the crowd and images of dancers are digitally manipulated so that logos and manic depictions of Aphex Twin appear on their projected images. It\u2019s a humour that wavers between caustic critique and outright silliness. Cheers ring out for skittering flashes of British celebrities, as reality TV stars such as Amber and Greg from Love Island are spliced into Technicolor flashes of the Queen, Pier Morgan and Boris Johnson \u2013 whose image gets a loud boo. The lasers are, bluntly, crazy, an impressive sensory assault. It\u2019s unabashed fun, strangers craning their necks and grinning at each other. Musically, Aphex Twin is on top form, manoeuvring at breakneck speed through genre-melting sounds. Heaving polyrhythmic techno tracks fold into industrial electro pumpers, thundering piano loops and buzzsaw jungle breaks. There are flashes of the past \u2013 the Future Sounds of London\u2019s Pulse State, the Octagon Man\u2019s Free-er Than Free, and D-Shake\u2019s Techno Trance (Paradise Is Now) capture that 90s UK hardcore euphoria \u2013 and nods to the future, with Egyptian producer Zuli\u2019s Trigger Finger and HVL\u2019s Sallow Myth. For Aphex Twin\u2019s own music, there\u2019s the hiss and funk of 2017\u2019s T16.5 MADMA with nastya+5.2 and aquatic bleeps of 2015\u2019s umil 25-01. Perhaps the sweetest moment comes in the latter movements of the set. After a caustic hardcore breakdown, a wash of ambience: Stone In Focus, from 1994\u2019s Selected Ambient Works Vol II. As everyone takes a breath, a father and son nearby nod at each other knowingly. All told, a faultless performance from a peerless artist.",

      "bodyText": "There are many in Sedgefield who did much for Tony Blair during his 24 years as MP for the County Durham constituency. But it was only Stephen Elliott who agreed to sacrifice his spare bedroom window for the then prime minister, his neighbour in the former mining village of Trimdon Colliery. \u201cWhen George Bush landed his helicopter here in 2003, I let the American secret service take over the back bedroom. They took the glass out and had snipers up there when the president and his wife went in to see Tony and Cherie,\u201d said the 60-year-old builder as he ate sausage and mash in his garden on Thursday. Elliott, whose late father was on the local Labour party executive during the Blair era, saw Nigel Farage on Wednesday\u2019s news telling a marquee full of Brexiters at Sedgefield racecourse that he was declaring an \u201call-out political war\u201d on the Labour party. It was a threat greeted with cheers by several hundred local Brexiters, many former Labour voters, who had all paid \u00a35 for this audience with the Brexit party leader. The Labour party cannot rely on the north-east any more, conceded Elliott. Even he did not think he could bring himself to vote Labour when the general election rolls around, and will probably abstain. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not the right leader \u2026 There are lots of Labour supporters I know who won\u2019t vote Labour because of Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d Farage was rebuffed by the Conservatives this week when he suggested an electoral pact to beat Labour which would see the Tories stand down in seats where \u2013 to quote Farage\u2019s press officer, Gawain Towler \u2013 \u201cno one has ever kissed a Tory but they kissed us in the Euro elections and voted heavily leave\u201d. Labour ought to have breathed a sigh of relief when a senior Tory said Farage would not be allowed \u201canywhere near government\u201d because he was not a \u201cfit and proper person\u201d. They know their once rock-solid vote in many leave areas, particularly in the former coalfields, is looking shaky: in May\u2019s European elections, the Brexit party was easily the largest party in County Durham, winning 39.5% of the vote, with Labour second on 19.3%.

More than 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries \u2013 with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people \u2013 have signed on. This week, ahead of the UN climate summit on 23 September, the Covering Climate Now partners have pledged to increase the volume and visibility of their climate coverage in the first large-scale collaboration of the partnership. The Guardian is making a selection of its climate coverage available to partners for free to help publications without dedicated environment desks serve their audiences. The Covering Climate Now network represents every corner of the media including TV networks (CBS News, Al Jazeera), newspapers (El Pa\u00eds, the Toronto Star), digital players (BuzzFeed, HuffPost, Vox), wire services (Getty Images, Bloomberg), magazines (Nature, Scientific American), and dozens of podcasts, local publishers, radio and TV stations. Countries represented include Togo, Nepal, Argentina, India, Japan, Australia, Brazil, the Netherlands and dozens more. The Guardian has long made climate coverage a top news priority, keeping the story on its front page daily. Earlier this year, the Guardian updated its style guide to introduce new terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world. The Guardian now favors the terms \u201cclimate crisis\u201d and \u201cclimate emergency\u201d over \u201cclimate change\u201d. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue,\u201d said the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. \u201cThe phrase \u2018climate change\u2019, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.\u201d The Guardian also began putting global CO2 levels in the daily weather forecast in its print publication earlier this year. At the launch of the Covering Climate Now partnership in May, co-founders Mark Hertsgaard of the Nation and Kyle Pope, editor-in-chief of Columbia Journalism Review, wrote an impassioned op-ed calling for change in how the media covers the climate crisis. \u201cAt a time when civilization is accelerating toward disaster, climate silence continues to reign across the bulk of the US news media,\u201d Hertsgaard and Pope wrote. \u201cEspecially on television, where most Americans still get their news, the brutal demands of ratings and money work against adequate coverage of the biggest story of our time.\u201d While the project began in America, it has quickly gained traction globally and now includes dozens of international news organizations and coverage in multiple languages.

Another shopper, Nancy Borell, says she has switched from the nearby Aldi to Jack\u2019s: \u201cI come here every week because it is local, cheap and good quality. You can more or less get everything you want.\u201d Her father, Mick Welham, has even succumbed to one of its WIGIG (when it\u2019s gone it\u2019s gone) deals and is clutching a \u00a312 Daewoo kettle. \u201cMy only gripe is the tills,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey sling it at you.\u201d But time has not stood still in a fiercely competitive UK grocery market where the German discounters are both opening roughly a store a week. The big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 have lost a percentage point of market share over the past 12 months, according to research firm Kantar. That equates to almost 1.2bn and nearly all those sales have ended up in the tills of the discounters, with Aldi expected to report strong figures on Monday. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein, said Jack\u2019s was a research and development format that was not material to Tesco\u2019s finances at this stage: \u201cIf it works \u2026 they will tell us. If it doesn\u2019t, it probably will be closed.\u201d Bryan Roberts, an analyst at TCC Global, thinks more time is needed before the success or otherwise of Jack\u2019s can be judged. \u201cI don\u2019t think Jack\u2019s has set the world on fire, but it\u2019s not a disaster either. You need to give something like this breathing space. I\u2019m still relatively impressed by it as a concept \u2013 what is missing is scale and momentum.\u201d Packing his shopping into the boot of his car, Phil Miller feels Jack\u2019s has turned a corner in Chatteris, where many are in low-paid agricultural work. \u201cWhen Jack\u2019s first opened it didn\u2019t seem to take off and if you saw three or four people in there you were lucky. It\u2019s busier now. The prices are very nearly the same [as Aldi] and what I can\u2019t get from Jack\u2019s I get from there. If it\u2019s 39p down there it\u2019s 40p here \u2013 there\u2019s a penny in it.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2019 because we cited a quarterly figure of \u00a3270m in lost sales to Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons. The intended citation was a yearly figure which equates to \u00a31.2bn in lost sales.",

      "bodyText": "JoAni Johnson, a sexagenarian model with a cascade of hair the colour of moonlight, arrives for our teashop rendezvous serene as a breeze, as if the humidity of a New York summer was something that inconvenienced only other people. She shares this serenity gladly. Today she calms young models with advice she was given by Bethann Hardison, a long-time activist who has fought to diversify the fashion industry for decades: \u201cClose your eyes, take a deep breath, open your eyes, and walk.\u201d Most of us are lucky to have one shot on life\u2019s merry-go-round, but for JoAni Johnson the ride just keeps getting faster. Having grown up in the 1960s at the height of the civil rights movement, she now finds herself being feted as an exemplar of fashion\u2019s reckoning with runway racism and misogyny as brands scramble to connect with millennial customers. When, in May, she was hired to model Rihanna\u2019s fashion line, Fenty, fashion bloggers swooned at the symbolism of a young black designer choosing an older black woman as her muse. Older women who defy convention have been having something of a moment lately. Maybe you\u2019re among the 3.8 million people who follows Baddiewinkle, the 90-year-old Instagram celebrity who posts images of herself in garish attire alongside innuendo-laden captions. And perhaps you have seen the New York Times video of Inge Ginsburg, the 96-year-old Holocaust survivor who fronts a death-metal band in Switzerland. Then there\u2019s Iris Apfel, the lavishly accessorized subject of a documentary by Albert Maysles. Last February, Apfel signed with modelling agency IMG, home of Kate Moss and Karlie Kloss. She is 97. You can buy a Barbie doll in her likeness. You\u2019d have to be a killjoy not to admire the ways in which these women thumb their noses at social pieties, but it\u2019s hard to avoid a whiff of the Victorian sideshow in the way they are presented to us as kooks. Baddiewinkle may be a delicious riposte to a culture that has stigmatised the old as dull, but we also need templates to show how age can be strong, eloquent and beautiful. Johnson, 67, has walked the runway for Ozwald Boateng and Eileen Fisher, and featured in ads for Pyer Moss, arguably America\u2019s hottest fashion label.

      "body": "<p>March 2016 was only the third time David Califa had taken a group of Israelis on his Hungry Tourist food tour to Istanbul. It was going well; he was happy showing people the city he loved. On the morning of the 19th they went to Hayvore, a restaurant in the heart of the central Beyo\u011flu district, for a breakfast of pide, a kind of Turkish pizza, sometimes made with ground meat or vegetables, often gooey with molten cheese and topped with a fried egg. Califa had planned that afterwards they would eat k\u00f6fte at Hussein\u2019s and visit the market to stop at his favourite fish shop Re\u015fat Balik where owner Ahmet Yazg\u00fcne\u015f had the most delicious lakerda \u2013 cured bonito. The group of 12 walked to Istiklal Caddesi, the elegant street at the heart of Beyo\u011flu, once lined with grand department stores and colonnaded arcades, now pedestrianised andfull of international chains and banks. They stopped for a group photo.</p> <p>\u201cI heard a bang like a metallic slam,\u201d says Califa. \u201cThen I opened my eyes and there was smoke.\u201d Somehow he found he was still standing up, but his clothes were torn and his ankle was bleeding. \u201cI saw my friends lying in front of me.\u201d One woman was already dead. Others were terribly wounded. He saw too the body of the suicide bomber. \u201cMy girlfriend took me by the hand and we sat down. It felt like ages waiting. Half an hour feels like a lifetime. Everyone was bleeding, everyone was shouting. Two of my friends died in front of me. An old man working in a small shop selling cheap scarves ran into the street with all the scarves and tried to staunch the bleeding and tie tourniquets. I remember looking up and people were at every window with phones.\u201d</p> <p>A Turkish member of the Islamic State <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/19/istanbul-hit-by-deadly-bomb-attack\" title=\"\">had detonated a suicide bomb</a>. Four people were killed: three from Califa\u2019s group, Simha Damri, 60, Yonatan Suher, 40, and Avraham Goldman, 69, as well as a passerby, an Iranian, Ali Reza Razmkhah whose two small children were among the 36 people injured. </p> <p>Califa\u2019s group were taken to different hospitals, where some needed extensive surgery; the Israelis quickly repatriated their citizens. Califa had shrapnel in his ankle. He was in hospital in Tel Aviv for a week. For a while he felt numb. Three months after the attack, he split up with his girlfriend. \u201cWhile I was sitting on the street, waiting for the ambulance, I realised life had changed. Even then I thought: I would not let the terrorists punish me twice, first with the loss of my friends and then to deny me a city I loved.

When Ahmet Yazg\u00fcne\u015f caught sight of Califa, his big white walrus moustache broke into a smile: \u201cOh Dudi! My best friend! Oh, my brother!\u201d He cut a slice of salmon and fed Califa. \u201cGood, yes? Can I take a picture and post it on my new Instagram?\u201d He called for tea to be brought. The two big men hugged and grinned and cried on each other\u2019s shoulders. Yazg\u00fcne\u015f had been expecting Califa and his group when he heard the bomb go off. \u201cI wanted to find Dudi, is he good or not?\u201d he told me in his imperfect English. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.

(This year Israeli visitor number to Turkey are up to over 400,000, but most are Israeli Arabs.) After a few last-minute dropouts, just three people came: a retired Israeli lawyer, a winemaker from California and a woman training in nutrition and astrology from Virginia. Together with Sinan Hamamsarilar, Califa\u2019s guide and partner in Istanbul, we were a random crew. The winemaker was an adventurous sort, he had heard that Califa\u2019s group had been attacked and he was interested to meet him. The Israeli knew of course, because the attack <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/explosion-rocks-major-istanbul-shopping-street-reports/\" title=\"\">had been front page news</a>, and was sanguine about it. For the Virginian the news of that kind of violence was a little alarming \u2013 it was only the second time she had travelled outside the US. But although we avoided politics, it turns out that discussions of terrorism and trauma are now, sadly, pretty universal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F1a3e80963273d5d697d5acbb6eb180fc32feed88%3Fcrop%3D0_374_5616_3370&amp;left-caption=Kebab%20with%20cherry%20sauce%20and%20artichokes%20stuffed%20with%20green%20plums%20at%20%C3%87iya&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F9e0c4ac3518269751e73c1374bc43ac1a71298fd%3Fcrop%3D0_174_5616_3370&amp;right-caption=Photographs%3A%20Rena%20Effendi%2FThe%20Observer&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"The Hungry Tourist\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F1a3e80963273d5d697d5acbb6eb180fc32feed88%3Fcrop%3D0_374_5616_3370&left-caption=Kebab%20with%20cherry%20sauce%20and%20artichokes%20stuffed%20with%20green%20plums%20at%20%C3%87iya&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F9e0c4ac3518269751e73c1374bc43ac1a71298fd%3Fcrop%3D0_174_5616_3370&right-caption=Photographs%3A%20Rena%20Effendi%2FThe%20Observer&always-place-captions-below=false\">The Hungry Tourist</a> </figure>  <p>We ate high and low; browsed markets, cruised the Bosphorus to dinner. I began to understand the sophistication of Anatolian cuisine. At \u00c7\u00f6mlek Kurufas\u00fclye, high up on the Asian side, with a view of the whole city, we ate humble baked beans accompanied by a soothing tangy yogurt so thick you could stand a spoon up in it. I had always thought of doner as a cheap kebab; Hamamsarilar showed us how the doner masters layer marinated lamb and beef so that when it is grilled it becomes compressed and can be sliced in sheets. We ate at \u00c7iya, featured in an episode of Netflix\u2019s <em>Chef\u2019s Table</em>, where the chef Musa Da\u011fdeviren showcases regional dishes; we ate artichokes stuffed with sour green plums and pine nuts and cherry kebab.Califa took us to one of his favourite places, D\u00f6nerci \u015eahin Usta, set in a tiny niche in the gold souk: he had affectionately nicknamed it the hole-in-the-wall Doner. We watched as the doner-maker carved thin slices with a long knife. Califa told me the maker\u2019s father, who had recently retired after a heart attack, had been the real master and showed me a video of the old man carving slices so thin that they fell from the spit like silk ribbons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b78b600b49cae806b3d1104037223fa3fb7dd57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b78b600b49cae806b3d1104037223fa3fb7dd57/0_0_5616_3478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crossing the Bosporus to the Asian side of Istanbul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"619\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crossing the Bosporus to the Asian side of Istanbul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rena Effendi/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One morning we took the ferry to the Asian side of Istanbul for lunch. The Bosphorus churned with ships and boats and tugs; Califa put his phone away and sat beside me. He talked about the friends he had lost in the bombing: \u201cAll three of them were better people than me.\u201d Two of them he had only met at the start of the tour, one, Yonni, he had felt an immediate connection with. \u201cHe was fascinating and funny, witty, but quiet, self-contained. And we became friends, it was like magic, we understood each other and then he died in front of me. Whenever I remember him I see us here, on the top deck of the ferry, talking. These 20 minutes on the ferry are enchanted. You are not here and you are not there, you are between two continents.\u201d</p> <p>Califa knows that their deaths are not his fault, \u201cbut I cannot walk away from the fact that I brought those people here\u201d. He still has shrapnel in his ankle and at night it aches. The pain makes him remember that \u201cthey saved me. They stood between me and the bomb.\u201d</p> <p>Sinan Hamamsarilar has been on Califa\u2019s tour in Israel several times. A few thousand Turks visit Israel each year, but most are on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The first time Califa watched as Hamamsarilar posted pictures of his meals and videos of markets to his 155k followers on Instagram, with a growing realisation. \u201cI said, wow, you know,\u201d \u2013 Califa stopped for a moment as the emotion choked his throat. \u201cWe did it! We created this bridge. People on both sides can talk to each other.\u201d Turks are now the second highest nationality, after Americans, following the Hungry Tourist on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s huge because I was trying to do this, and I lost friends doing this and suddenly Sinan comes to Israel and posts with so much love about Israel \u2013 without any inhibition, without any fear, without any sense of political correctness in his own country \u2013 and I said to Sinan, let\u2019s be partners!\u201d</p> <p>Califa is determined to bring more Hungry Tourists to Turkey. \u201cThis place is very important. We have to sell it to the world somehow, they have to understand, it will be word of mouth,\u201d Califa told me. He was optimistic, the autumn tour was already sold out and the winemaker from California had such a good time that he wanted to bring his wife and sons on a road trip through Anatolia planned for October.</p>",

      "bodyText": "March 2016 was only the third time David Califa had taken a group of Israelis on his Hungry Tourist food tour to Istanbul. It was going well; he was happy showing people the city he loved. On the morning of the 19th they went to Hayvore, a restaurant in the heart of the central Beyo\u011flu district, for a breakfast of pide, a kind of Turkish pizza, sometimes made with ground meat or vegetables, often gooey with molten cheese and topped with a fried egg. Califa had planned that afterwards they would eat k\u00f6fte at Hussein\u2019s and visit the market to stop at his favourite fish shop Re\u015fat Balik where owner Ahmet Yazg\u00fcne\u015f had the most delicious lakerda \u2013 cured bonito. The group of 12 walked to Istiklal Caddesi, the elegant street at the heart of Beyo\u011flu, once lined with grand department stores and colonnaded arcades, now pedestrianised andfull of international chains and banks. They stopped for a group photo. \u201cI heard a bang like a metallic slam,\u201d says Califa. \u201cThen I opened my eyes and there was smoke.\u201d Somehow he found he was still standing up, but his clothes were torn and his ankle was bleeding. \u201cI saw my friends lying in front of me.\u201d One woman was already dead. Others were terribly wounded. He saw too the body of the suicide bomber. \u201cMy girlfriend took me by the hand and we sat down. It felt like ages waiting. Half an hour feels like a lifetime. Everyone was bleeding, everyone was shouting. Two of my friends died in front of me. An old man working in a small shop selling cheap scarves ran into the street with all the scarves and tried to staunch the bleeding and tie tourniquets. I remember looking up and people were at every window with phones.\u201d A Turkish member of the Islamic State had detonated a suicide bomb. Four people were killed: three from Califa\u2019s group, Simha Damri, 60, Yonatan Suher, 40, and Avraham Goldman, 69, as well as a passerby, an Iranian, Ali Reza Razmkhah whose two small children were among the 36 people injured. Califa\u2019s group were taken to different hospitals, where some needed extensive surgery; the Israelis quickly repatriated their citizens. Califa had shrapnel in his ankle. He was in hospital in Tel Aviv for a week. For a while he felt numb. Three months after the attack, he split up with his girlfriend. \u201cWhile I was sitting on the street, waiting for the ambulance, I realised life had changed. Even then I thought: I would not let the terrorists punish me twice, first with the loss of my friends and then to deny me a city I loved. I knew I would come back.\u201d I first met David Califa in Spain; we were standing in front of the grill at the acclaimed restaurant Elkano on the Basque coast, watching whole turbot blister in the coals. He introduced himself pointing at his T-shirt that read, \u201cThe Hungry Tourist\u201d, admitting with a laugh: \u201cBut the truth is that I am not hungry very often.\u201d Califa\u2019s tours are high end and cost from \u00a32,800-\u00a36,000 for 4-6 days. They take small groups to restaurants on the World\u2019s 50 Best list and impossible-to-book places: Noma in Copenhagen, Etxebarri in Spain, Saito the sushi god of Tokyo. Through his relationships with local foodies and chefs he has access to private dining rooms and special meals as well as insider knowledge of the best street food stalls. We met again in Istanbul in June, on the terrace of the Four Seasons on the Bosphorus. He took a picture of the perfectly pink lamb chops in front of us with his iPhone then put one on my plate, and then another. Stubbly, bald, with a round head and a round stomach, Califa is usually smiling, prompted by something delicious he has just eaten or something delicious he has given someone else to eat. He taps at his phone incessantly. He has an assistant in Israel, but he\u2019s essentially a one-man band, connecting, organising, booking; posting, posting all the time: Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, where he has 265,000 followers. Everyone in his photos is always grinning. \u201cI am trying to send people home with a memory they will never forget,\u201d he told me.

We went to Re\u015fat Balik, the fish shop Califa\u2019s group were due to visit on the morning of the attack. When Ahmet Yazg\u00fcne\u015f caught sight of Califa, his big white walrus moustache broke into a smile: \u201cOh Dudi! My best friend! Oh, my brother!\u201d He cut a slice of salmon and fed Califa. \u201cGood, yes? Can I take a picture and post it on my new Instagram?\u201d He called for tea to be brought. The two big men hugged and grinned and cried on each other\u2019s shoulders. Yazg\u00fcne\u015f had been expecting Califa and his group when he heard the bomb go off. \u201cI wanted to find Dudi, is he good or not?\u201d he told me in his imperfect English. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. Terrorism is no good.\u201d Yazg\u00fcne\u015f had asked his son to find Califa\u2019s number in Israel and he finally reached him several days later. \u201cDudi told me: \u2018I am alive!\u2019 I thought, thank God.\u201d \u201cI was very moved,\u201d Califa told me. \u201cHe\u2019s Muslim, I\u2019m Israeli, but we are human.\u201d This summer\u2019s Hungry Tourist tour of Istanbul was unusually small; Califa admitted people were still wary of visiting Turkey. (This year Israeli visitor number to Turkey are up to over 400,000, but most are Israeli Arabs.) After a few last-minute dropouts, just three people came: a retired Israeli lawyer, a winemaker from California and a woman training in nutrition and astrology from Virginia. Together with Sinan Hamamsarilar, Califa\u2019s guide and partner in Istanbul, we were a random crew. The winemaker was an adventurous sort, he had heard that Califa\u2019s group had been attacked and he was interested to meet him. The Israeli knew of course, because the attack had been front page news, and was sanguine about it. For the Virginian the news of that kind of violence was a little alarming \u2013 it was only the second time she had travelled outside the US. But although we avoided politics, it turns out that discussions of terrorism and trauma are now, sadly, pretty universal. We ate high and low; browsed markets, cruised the Bosphorus to dinner. I began to understand the sophistication of Anatolian cuisine. At \u00c7\u00f6mlek Kurufas\u00fclye, high up on the Asian side, with a view of the whole city, we ate humble baked beans accompanied by a soothing tangy yogurt so thick you could stand a spoon up in it. I had always thought of doner as a cheap kebab; Hamamsarilar showed us how the doner masters layer marinated lamb and beef so that when it is grilled it becomes compressed and can be sliced in sheets. We ate at \u00c7iya, featured in an episode of Netflix\u2019s Chef\u2019s Table, where the chef Musa Da\u011fdeviren showcases regional dishes; we ate artichokes stuffed with sour green plums and pine nuts and cherry kebab.Califa took us to one of his favourite places, D\u00f6nerci \u015eahin Usta, set in a tiny niche in the gold souk: he had affectionately nicknamed it the hole-in-the-wall Doner. We watched as the doner-maker carved thin slices with a long knife. Califa told me the maker\u2019s father, who had recently retired after a heart attack, had been the real master and showed me a video of the old man carving slices so thin that they fell from the spit like silk ribbons. One morning we took the ferry to the Asian side of Istanbul for lunch. The Bosphorus churned with ships and boats and tugs; Califa put his phone away and sat beside me. He talked about the friends he had lost in the bombing: \u201cAll three of them were better people than me.\u201d Two of them he had only met at the start of the tour, one, Yonni, he had felt an immediate connection with. \u201cHe was fascinating and funny, witty, but quiet, self-contained. And we became friends, it was like magic, we understood each other and then he died in front of me. Whenever I remember him I see us here, on the top deck of the ferry, talking. These 20 minutes on the ferry are enchanted. You are not here and you are not there, you are between two continents.\u201d Califa knows that their deaths are not his fault, \u201cbut I cannot walk away from the fact that I brought those people here\u201d. He still has shrapnel in his ankle and at night it aches. The pain makes him remember that \u201cthey saved me. They stood between me and the bomb.\u201d Sinan Hamamsarilar has been on Califa\u2019s tour in Israel several times. A few thousand Turks visit Israel each year, but most are on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The first time Califa watched as Hamamsarilar posted pictures of his meals and videos of markets to his 155k followers on Instagram, with a growing realisation. \u201cI said, wow, you know,\u201d \u2013 Califa stopped for a moment as the emotion choked his throat. \u201cWe did it! We created this bridge. People on both sides can talk to each other.\u201d Turks are now the second highest nationality, after Americans, following the Hungry Tourist on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s huge because I was trying to do this, and I lost friends doing this and suddenly Sinan comes to Israel and posts with so much love about Israel \u2013 without any inhibition, without any fear, without any sense of political correctness in his own country \u2013 and I said to Sinan, let\u2019s be partners!\u201d Califa is determined to bring more Hungry Tourists to Turkey. \u201cThis place is very important. We have to sell it to the world somehow, they have to understand, it will be word of mouth,\u201d Califa told me. He was optimistic, the autumn tour was already sold out and the winemaker from California had such a good time that he wanted to bring his wife and sons on a road trip through Anatolia planned for October.",

The old Cantonese guard have mostly retired from the catering business, their children, educated in the UK, moving into white-collar jobs. Since China began to open up in the early 1990s, a new generation of Chinese people, not only from the Cantonese south but all over the country, have had the chance to explore the world. Immigrants from other regions, particularly south-eastern Fujian province, have come to work in the kitchens of established Chinese restaurants and later to open their own. Students have flocked to British schools and universities, alongside growing numbers of Chinese tourists (the number of Chinese visits to Britain almost quadrupled between 2008 and 2018).</p> <p>These twin forces of a newly diverse population of Chinese restaurant workers and an equally diverse pool of Chinese customers have been equally important in reshaping British Chinese food. In the past, Chinese restaurants could only survive by catering for the British tastes of their time; now, particularly in university cities, they have a substantial market of recent arrivals from China, many of them young people, who want to eat the kind of food they enjoy at home. And since the late 1990s, that food has overwhelmingly been the spicy cuisine of Sichuan province.</p> <p>When my Sichuan cookbook was eventually published in 2001, Sichuanese food was still an unknown quantity for the vast majority of British people. Food journalists I met around that time had never experienced the arresting tingle of good Sichuan pepper on their lips or tasted a properly fiery mapo tofu. Little had been written about Sichuanese food in English: a couple of American cookbooks (Robert Delfs\u2019s <em>The Good Food of Szechwan</em> and Ellen Schrecker\u2019s <em>Mrs Chiang\u2019s Szechwan Cookbook</em>) had been the first to showcase the cuisine, but both were out of print. There were few Sichuanese people living in western countries, and until the 1990s, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/jun/10/foodanddrink.features6\" title=\"\">serendipity first took me to Sichuan</a>, it would have been impossible for a foreigner to research a regional Chinese cookbook on the ground, collecting recipes and describing at first hand local life and culture as I was able to. The culinary institute at which I\u2019d trained in the Sichuanese capital, Chengdu, had never previously had a foreign student. In the UK, \u201cSzechwan\u201d (an older transliteration than the current \u201cSichuan\u2019) was merely used to describe generically spicy dishes on Chinese menus.</p> <p>As the new market economy emerged in China in the 1990s, the restaurant scene, in the doldrums since the Cultural Revolution, once again erupted into life. With economic revival came an appetite for one of China liveliest and most stimulating cuisines. Sichuanese restaurants and snack shops opened all over the country; dishes such as shuizhuyu (tender slices of fish in a seething sea of oil and chillies) and hotpot became wildly fashionable. It was only natural that the new wave of Chinese sojourners and immigrants making their way to Britain brought this fashion with them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"883f0754a3771f3b4ab7caac6e83c428640e7983\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/883f0754a3771f3b4ab7caac6e83c428640e7983/473_87_1896_1896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lamb ribs with cumin at My Sichuan restaurant, Oxford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lamb ribs with cumin at My Sichuan restaurant, Oxford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Frost/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Already, around the time my book was published, the first shoots of a Sichuan restaurant spring had appeared in London. I began hearing rumours from Chinese friends of small restaurants in Acton and Kilburn serving authentic Sichuanese food, and was astonished when I visited Angeles on the Kilburn High Road, with its menu of traditional Sichuan dishes. It was the opening of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/may/21/foodanddrink.restaurants\" title=\"\"> Bar</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/may/21/foodanddrink.restaurants\" title=\"\">shu in Soho in 2006 </a>that really put the cuisine on the map. A businessman from Shandong province, Shao Wei, wanted to open a smart, central restaurant serving the kind of food his highly educated and often affluent Chinese friends wanted to eat. He assembled a team of five chefs from Sichuan, led by the talented Fu Wenhong, imported key seasonings from China and, before the restaurant opened, brought me on board as a consultant. From the beginning, we decided to dispense with crispy duck and other London Chinese staples, and offer a contemporary Sichuanese menu on Chinese terms. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These openings are only a taste of China\u2019s gastronomic diversity, but have shattered stereotypes of a monolithic cuisine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Barshu was at the forefront of a broader diversification of the Chinese restaurant scene. Before long, there were Sichuan restaurants in many parts of London, as well as in Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Oxford and other cities; even Cantonese restaurants began adding Sichuan dishes to their menus. Spicy Sichuan hotpot, adored throughout China, started to appear in specialist restaurants with tables cut out to hold bubbling cauldrons of chilli-laced broth.</p> <p>The cuisines of Hunan, another chilli-loving province, and the Dongbei (north-eastern) region followed in Sichuan\u2019s spicy wake. Many of the new regional restaurants started out with no English-language publicity but simply an eye for attracting Chinese customers, their menus reflecting Chinese more than local culinary fashions. The street food of Xi\u2019an and the great north west has begun to make its mark in London with the opening of Xi\u2019an Impression, Master Wei, Murger Han and Xi\u2019an Biang Biang Noodles. You can even head for the Silk Road in Walthamstow, where Uyghur chef Mukaddes Yadikar cooks up the specialities of her Xinjiang home at her restaurant Etles. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a53e73d46324a65477fdbf3150220a6d1c5b3b73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a53e73d46324a65477fdbf3150220a6d1c5b3b73/0_268_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"XI\u2019an Biangbang Noodles, Biang biang ribbon noodles with beef\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biang biang noodles with beef from Xi\u2019an Biang Biang Noodles in Spitalfields, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aside from regional flavours, the Chinese food scene has diversified in other ways. In London, diners can take their pick from a meal of shared dishes with rice, a dim sum lunch, a hotpot feast, a dumpling extravaganza at xiaolongbao specialist Din Tai Fung or an elegant mah jong dinner at Xu. Homegrown restaurants are now in competition with international brands, such as Din Tai Fung and Haidilao. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/31/a-wong-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">the British-born Chinese chef Andrew Wong </a>won a Michelin star for his inventive, historically inspired cooking.</p> <p>Beyond the formal dining sector, street food stalls and pop-ups have opened the kitchen door to new tastes and styles. There are toasty-bottomed Shanghainese buns on offer at Dumpling Shack in Spitalfields Market and spicy Chongqing noodles cooked up in the basement of a pub in Marylebone by Liu Xiaomian. Lillian Luk, originally from Shanghai, offers home-cooked Jiangnan food at her <a href=\"http://shanghaisupper.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Shanghai Supper Clubs</a>; another Shanghainese chef, Jason Li, hosts acclaimed dinners in Wapping under the name Dream of Shanghai. While these openings still represent only a taste of China\u2019s extraordinary gastronomic diversity, they have shattered old stereotypes of a monolithic Chinese cuisine.</p> <p>The availability of Chinese ingredients has also been transformed. Chinese supermarkets stock Sichuan chilli bean paste, fresh green Sichuan pepper, Sichuan pepper oil and facing heaven chillies. Even mainstream supermarkets sell Chinese brands favoured by Chinese customers, such as Lee Kum Kee seasonings and the addictive Laoganma chilli and black bean sauce. And while Chinatowns and Chinese superstores may have the greatest ranges of foods, a new generation of small east Asian grocers stock most of the basic ingredients for Chinese cooking.</p> <p>Despite all these developments, the UK Chinese restaurant scene faces serious constraints. The tightening of immigration rules a few years ago has made it almost impossible for restaurants to bring in new chefs from China. The rapid expansion of hotpot restaurants reflects not only the popularity of the dish, but also the fact that hotpot is a relatively low-skilled business: it\u2019s much easier to find staff to slice up raw ingredients for hotpot than chefs adept at wok cookery. There have been some attempts to introduce local training in Chinese cooking, most recently with a collaboration between Crawley College and the Tianjin School of Cuisine, but most restaurants are competing to employ Chinese chefs from the same limited pool already living in Britain.</p> <p>The proliferation of exciting Chinese street food has come hand in hand with a decline in more sophisticated cuisine; in London\u2019s Chinatown, accomplished Cantonese cooking, once the mainstay, is now almost impossible to find. Aside from these specific worries, Chinese restaurateurs, like everyone else in the business, complain of tough competition and soaring rents and rates.</p> <p>When it comes to Chinese cuisine in Britain, the possibilities are almost infinite. Late 20th century convention carves China up into four or eight regional cuisines, but in truth every region, province, city and town has its own specialities. The great south-western province of Yunnan, for example, is an extraordinary patchwork of foods and flavours; even Sichuanese and Cantonese cuisines are still relatively unexplored. While Britons\u2019 appetite for new Chinese foods may be boundless, the ability of Chinese restaurants to respond to it is tightly circumscribed. It remains to be seen whether we are at a peak of innovative Chinese cuisine in Britain, or on the brink of a multitude of new discoveries.</p> <p><em>The Food of Sichuan by Fuchsia Dunlop (Bloomsbury Publishing, \u00a330).

It was only when Chinese restaurants started opening in central London that they began to win the affections of customers who were not Chinese. The first in the West End seems to have been the Cathay in 1908; more appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, including the popular Ley-On in Wardour Street. By all accounts, it was the altered palates of servicemen returning from Asia after the second world war that helped to shift attitudes. After the war, the number of Chinese restaurants in London and other cities grew steadily.

Since China began to open up in the early 1990s, a new generation of Chinese people, not only from the Cantonese south but all over the country, have had the chance to explore the world. Immigrants from other regions, particularly south-eastern Fujian province, have come to work in the kitchens of established Chinese restaurants and later to open their own. Students have flocked to British schools and universities, alongside growing numbers of Chinese tourists (the number of Chinese visits to Britain almost quadrupled between 2008 and 2018). These twin forces of a newly diverse population of Chinese restaurant workers and an equally diverse pool of Chinese customers have been equally important in reshaping British Chinese food. In the past, Chinese restaurants could only survive by catering for the British tastes of their time; now, particularly in university cities, they have a substantial market of recent arrivals from China, many of them young people, who want to eat the kind of food they enjoy at home. And since the late 1990s, that food has overwhelmingly been the spicy cuisine of Sichuan province. When my Sichuan cookbook was eventually published in 2001, Sichuanese food was still an unknown quantity for the vast majority of British people. Food journalists I met around that time had never experienced the arresting tingle of good Sichuan pepper on their lips or tasted a properly fiery mapo tofu. Little had been written about Sichuanese food in English: a couple of American cookbooks (Robert Delfs\u2019s The Good Food of Szechwan and Ellen Schrecker\u2019s Mrs Chiang\u2019s Szechwan Cookbook) had been the first to showcase the cuisine, but both were out of print. There were few Sichuanese people living in western countries, and until the 1990s, when serendipity first took me to Sichuan, it would have been impossible for a foreigner to research a regional Chinese cookbook on the ground, collecting recipes and describing at first hand local life and culture as I was able to. The culinary institute at which I\u2019d trained in the Sichuanese capital, Chengdu, had never previously had a foreign student. In the UK, \u201cSzechwan\u201d (an older transliteration than the current \u201cSichuan\u2019) was merely used to describe generically spicy dishes on Chinese menus. As the new market economy emerged in China in the 1990s, the restaurant scene, in the doldrums since the Cultural Revolution, once again erupted into life. With economic revival came an appetite for one of China liveliest and most stimulating cuisines. Sichuanese restaurants and snack shops opened all over the country; dishes such as shuizhuyu (tender slices of fish in a seething sea of oil and chillies) and hotpot became wildly fashionable. It was only natural that the new wave of Chinese sojourners and immigrants making their way to Britain brought this fashion with them. Already, around the time my book was published, the first shoots of a Sichuan restaurant spring had appeared in London. I began hearing rumours from Chinese friends of small restaurants in Acton and Kilburn serving authentic Sichuanese food, and was astonished when I visited Angeles on the Kilburn High Road, with its menu of traditional Sichuan dishes. It was the opening of Barshu in Soho in 2006 that really put the cuisine on the map. A businessman from Shandong province, Shao Wei, wanted to open a smart, central restaurant serving the kind of food his highly educated and often affluent Chinese friends wanted to eat. He assembled a team of five chefs from Sichuan, led by the talented Fu Wenhong, imported key seasonings from China and, before the restaurant opened, brought me on board as a consultant. From the beginning, we decided to dispense with crispy duck and other London Chinese staples, and offer a contemporary Sichuanese menu on Chinese terms. Barshu was at the forefront of a broader diversification of the Chinese restaurant scene. Before long, there were Sichuan restaurants in many parts of London, as well as in Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Oxford and other cities; even Cantonese restaurants began adding Sichuan dishes to their menus. Spicy Sichuan hotpot, adored throughout China, started to appear in specialist restaurants with tables cut out to hold bubbling cauldrons of chilli-laced broth. The cuisines of Hunan, another chilli-loving province, and the Dongbei (north-eastern) region followed in Sichuan\u2019s spicy wake. Many of the new regional restaurants started out with no English-language publicity but simply an eye for attracting Chinese customers, their menus reflecting Chinese more than local culinary fashions. The street food of Xi\u2019an and the great north west has begun to make its mark in London with the opening of Xi\u2019an Impression, Master Wei, Murger Han and Xi\u2019an Biang Biang Noodles. You can even head for the Silk Road in Walthamstow, where Uyghur chef Mukaddes Yadikar cooks up the specialities of her Xinjiang home at her restaurant Etles. Aside from regional flavours, the Chinese food scene has diversified in other ways. In London, diners can take their pick from a meal of shared dishes with rice, a dim sum lunch, a hotpot feast, a dumpling extravaganza at xiaolongbao specialist Din Tai Fung or an elegant mah jong dinner at Xu. Homegrown restaurants are now in competition with international brands, such as Din Tai Fung and Haidilao. In 2017, the British-born Chinese chef Andrew Wong won a Michelin star for his inventive, historically inspired cooking. Beyond the formal dining sector, street food stalls and pop-ups have opened the kitchen door to new tastes and styles. There are toasty-bottomed Shanghainese buns on offer at Dumpling Shack in Spitalfields Market and spicy Chongqing noodles cooked up in the basement of a pub in Marylebone by Liu Xiaomian. Lillian Luk, originally from Shanghai, offers home-cooked Jiangnan food at her Shanghai Supper Clubs; another Shanghainese chef, Jason Li, hosts acclaimed dinners in Wapping under the name Dream of Shanghai. While these openings still represent only a taste of China\u2019s extraordinary gastronomic diversity, they have shattered old stereotypes of a monolithic Chinese cuisine. The availability of Chinese ingredients has also been transformed. Chinese supermarkets stock Sichuan chilli bean paste, fresh green Sichuan pepper, Sichuan pepper oil and facing heaven chillies. Even mainstream supermarkets sell Chinese brands favoured by Chinese customers, such as Lee Kum Kee seasonings and the addictive Laoganma chilli and black bean sauce. And while Chinatowns and Chinese superstores may have the greatest ranges of foods, a new generation of small east Asian grocers stock most of the basic ingredients for Chinese cooking. Despite all these developments, the UK Chinese restaurant scene faces serious constraints. The tightening of immigration rules a few years ago has made it almost impossible for restaurants to bring in new chefs from China. The rapid expansion of hotpot restaurants reflects not only the popularity of the dish, but also the fact that hotpot is a relatively low-skilled business: it\u2019s much easier to find staff to slice up raw ingredients for hotpot than chefs adept at wok cookery. There have been some attempts to introduce local training in Chinese cooking, most recently with a collaboration between Crawley College and the Tianjin School of Cuisine, but most restaurants are competing to employ Chinese chefs from the same limited pool already living in Britain. The proliferation of exciting Chinese street food has come hand in hand with a decline in more sophisticated cuisine; in London\u2019s Chinatown, accomplished Cantonese cooking, once the mainstay, is now almost impossible to find. Aside from these specific worries, Chinese restaurateurs, like everyone else in the business, complain of tough competition and soaring rents and rates. When it comes to Chinese cuisine in Britain, the possibilities are almost infinite. Late 20th century convention carves China up into four or eight regional cuisines, but in truth every region, province, city and town has its own specialities. The great south-western province of Yunnan, for example, is an extraordinary patchwork of foods and flavours; even Sichuanese and Cantonese cuisines are still relatively unexplored. While Britons\u2019 appetite for new Chinese foods may be boundless, the ability of Chinese restaurants to respond to it is tightly circumscribed. It remains to be seen whether we are at a peak of innovative Chinese cuisine in Britain, or on the brink of a multitude of new discoveries.

Polly Frame, excellent as psychologist Kris, is emotionally torn when Keegan Joyce appears as long-lost boyfriend Ray. He is as attractive and as inscrutable as the planet itself. Pulled in two directions \u2013 by scientific rigour and human passion \u2013 Kris sees an escape from loneliness in the very thing that will make her more isolated. Matters are no easier for Ray, a personality without a past, slowly destroyed by self-awareness.</p> <p>All this is consummately staged by Matthew Lutton in a co-production with Melbourne\u2019s Malthouse theatre, bringing a human scale to the otherworldly seascapes and arid spaceship interiors created by designer Hyemi Shin and the technical team.

It seems only right, then, that each time it is told, the story of Solaris shifts in shape. First, came the 1961 novel by Stanis\u0142aw Lem, coupling dense tracts of tech-speak with an unknown terror worthy of Edgar Allan Poe. Where the 1972 Tarkovsky movie was spare and reflective, the 2002 Soderbergh version was all about the wish-fulfilment romance between George Clooney, as a newly arrived spaceman, and Natascha McElhone, an apparition of his former wife. Likewise, David Greig\u2019s adaptation, the most satisfying of them all, is its own thing. Although rooted in the novel, it takes bold and rewarding liberties with character and plot. This is partly to make theatrical sense; the crew of the playwright\u2019s gender-balanced spaceship are now talkative instead of taciturn, their attempts to understand the watery planet a collegiate enterprise, the better for us to know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s partly also to home in on the themes of loneliness, communication and unknowability. In Greig\u2019s version, Solaris learns to talk to its visitors step by step, manifesting itself in increasingly sophisticated ways. First, it sends gifts of Earth-like objects, and eventually emissaries in human form. The more real these manifestations become, the greater the existential crisis. Polly Frame, excellent as psychologist Kris, is emotionally torn when Keegan Joyce appears as long-lost boyfriend Ray. He is as attractive and as inscrutable as the planet itself. Pulled in two directions \u2013 by scientific rigour and human passion \u2013 Kris sees an escape from loneliness in the very thing that will make her more isolated. Matters are no easier for Ray, a personality without a past, slowly destroyed by self-awareness. All this is consummately staged by Matthew Lutton in a co-production with Melbourne\u2019s Malthouse theatre, bringing a human scale to the otherworldly seascapes and arid spaceship interiors created by designer Hyemi Shin and the technical team. With its sharp, cinematic cuts and rumbling waves of sound, Solaris troubles and tantalises. \u2022 At Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 5 October, then at Lyric Hammersmith, London, 10 October to 2 November.",

Boomers fans will be heartbroken, but the pubs around Parramatta will be heaving. It\u2019s been a long time between drinks in the NRL for Eels fans - and what a treat witnessed in Parramatta as their team ran out 58-0 winners - yes, 58-0, over the Broncos. Bring on the Storm next week in Melbourne.</p> <p>And of course earlier, a huge upset in the Super Netball grand final as the Sunshine Coast Lightning were denied a three-peat by a resurgent Sydney Swifts. A much deserved premiership after so long in the netball wilderness!</p> <p>Contrasting emotions - big wins and tough losses.

A four goal margin at quarter-time has double by the main break. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/9Netball/status/1173087231029825537\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#39;They can&#39;t do anything wrong&#39;<br><br>WATCH: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Channel9?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Channel9</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/9Netball?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#9Netball</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SSNLightningSwifts?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SSNLightningSwifts</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SSNGrandFinal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SSNGrandFinal</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/QfQ95aw3gp\">pic.twitter.com/QfQ95aw3gp</a></p>&mdash; 9Netball (@9Netball) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/9Netball/status/1173087231029825537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 15, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d7db8c28f08f30dc5bbb8d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T04:09:08.108Z\">5.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Q2: 3 mins remaining: Lightning 23-27 Swifts - </strong>Errors in both circles slow the scoreboard.

      "bodyText": "And the sports action doesn\u2019t stop there - join the redoubtable Jonathan Howcroft over on our Ashes liveblog, as Australia faces a backs-to-the-wall effort to salvage the fifth and final Test at the Oval: In expert commentary the great Shane Heal summed it all up for the Boomers. \u201cI\u2019ve been there twice (finishing fourth at a major tournament) - and you never really get over it\u201d. A gut-punch of a finish for a team of warriors who gave so much over the past fortnight, but on balance of play you\u2019d have to say France were deserving winners. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave Sportwatch on this day of huge contrasts. Boomers fans will be heartbroken, but the pubs around Parramatta will be heaving. It\u2019s been a long time between drinks in the NRL for Eels fans - and what a treat witnessed in Parramatta as their team ran out 58-0 winners - yes, 58-0, over the Broncos. Bring on the Storm next week in Melbourne. And of course earlier, a huge upset in the Super Netball grand final as the Sunshine Coast Lightning were denied a three-peat by a resurgent Sydney Swifts. A much deserved premiership after so long in the netball wilderness! Contrasting emotions - big wins and tough losses. That\u2019s Sportswatch! We wondered what that double-overtime loss to Spain took out of the Boomers just 48 hours ago, well that final quarter-and-a-half was the answer. Out to a 15 point lead at one stage the Boomers were sitting high and dry. Gobert and Fournier were spluttering, but the other French stars stood tall, and too many in green &amp; gold had just hit empty. An unbelievable tournament - unbelievable effort - but they finish, as they have so often in the past - in fourth place. Heroic effort from the Boomers. Close, but no cigar. Sacre bleu. It\u2019s De Colo who slips his defenders. Dellavedova eyes a three, but he can\u2019t land it. Batum is fouled and goes to the stripe. Goulding with the last play, but he\u2019s lost it. And that\u2019s it: France have won the Basketball World Cup bronze medal! Final quarter 9 min: France 64-59 Australia What a cruel game basketball is. They\u2019re still giving it everything, the Boomers - but the sweat and blood they\u2019ve put into this tournament, and in about 40 seconds time it could all be over - and they\u2019ll finish empty-handed! Mills with a big 3! Can they find something? France call timeout. Final quarter 9 min: France 63-56 Australia No waaaaay! It\u2019s Albicy - from three range! This is incredible. He goes pointless for about 35 minutes, and then steps up at the death to drain three consecutive 3 pointers! Unbelievable. Forget Fournier, forget Gobert - it\u2019s been the De Colo and Albicy show. Amazing stuff. Final quarter 8 min: France 60-56 Australia Mills looks to dribble to give himself room, and he\u2019s fumbled off his heel back into halfcourt. Ach. Put that down to fatigue - he\u2019s been nearly flawless for two weeks, Patty! De Colo with a huge steal. France ball in hand 80 seconds to play. Final quarter 8 min: France 60-56 Australia And Gobert has scored his first points of the game! With 90 seconds to play. Ridiculous! Lemanis calls his final time out. What can the Boomers come up with from the tactics board? Final quarter 8 min: France 58-56 Australia 16 turnovers for Australia. It\u2019s been their Achilles heel all tournament - maybe trying to force the play on too many occasions. France\u2019s game from here you\u2019d fear unless they can pull out something very special. Dellavedova fouls Fournier, France to feed with just over two minutes to play. Final quarter 7 min: France 58-56 Australia Fournier with a great drive. He\u2019s been missing for 10 minutes or so, but he\u2019s back when it matters. Nic Kay chimes in with another two - how good has he been both against Spain and now France. And would you believe it - it\u2019s Albicy with another three! Final quarter 5 min: France 53-54 Australia Nice from Bogut - great touch off a Mills feed. Can he lift the Boomers? Now it\u2019s Albicy with a bomb outside the arc! Where\u2019s he been all night - that\u2019s his first points. Mills drives to the basket, this is better from Patty. France miss and Australia with a chance, but Kay\u2019s shot is knocked away. Game on! Final quarter 4 min: France 50-50 Australia Delly with the layoff to Mills, and it\u2019s a key score for Patty. We\u2019re back level and France go to the timeout. De Colo is remarkably now the game\u2019s point-leader, alongside Ingles with 17 each. Poirier and Batum with a useful eight and seven each. Final quarter 3 min: France 50-48 Australia Wowee wow. De Colo bombs another huge three! Forget Fournier - this is the man who\u2019s getting it done. Who needs a 8-0 team run, when you can have an 8-0 scoring run by an individual player! Wild. Nic Kay with a settling two. They needed that Australia. Final quarter 1 min: France 47-46 Australia Oh my! It\u2019s De Colo with a big three to start the final. They\u2019re coming home hot, France. Dellavedova looks to respond fire, but he\u2019s missed his 3pt attempt. Now it\u2019s the Fenerbache star from the stripe, and he lands 2/2 to put the French in front! Incroyable. Baynes misses from the jump shot - it\u2019s not an ideal play. Mills back on court - what can he find for the final minute. Dellavedova with a bucket - very important at this stage, and then it\u2019s Mills with the block! Great defensive play from one of the smallest guys on the court. A huge final quarter to come. They\u2019re looking flat, the Boomers. Big lift needed. Third quarter 9 min - France 42-44 Australia It\u2019s a 12-4 scoring run to the World No 3 team, ooh la la! Ingles looks for a three, but can\u2019t land it - and then it\u2019s Poirier again with a massive dunk! Lemanis calls a timeout. Mills has sat out a lot of this quarter - is he carrying a minor knock? They\u2019ve had some shabby third quarters during this tournament, the Boomers, but this has been the worst, hands down. Third quarter 8 min - France 38-44 Australia Goulding misses the layout, and then Poirier slams down the dunk! Here they come! Ingles hits a necessary 2pt-er, before De Colo helps himself for France, coast to coast. My, oh my. They were out by 15 and France have just eaten into this lead. De Colo again. The other stars are standing up, with Fournier and Gobert playing cold. Third quarter 6 min - France 32-42 Australia Baynes from tight under the ring for two! Fournier fires from three, but misses. Goulding called for an unsportsmanlike foul for a body-check on Fournier off the ball. Eep - they can\u2019t hand France momentum here, the Boomers. He only hits 1/2 but then it\u2019s Batum from outside the arc! Bomb. Four-point play for the French and Lemanis calls a time out. Third quarter 5 min - France 28-40 Australia Terrific desperation from Creek! He\u2019s sprinted full-court to deny De Colo from behind on the lay up, but he\u2019s hurt himself on a hoarding. Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s okay for the Boomers. Third quarter 4 min - France 28-40 Australia Big dunk Batum! Mills fires from three range - close, but no cigar! Landale with a tip in, Delly assist. And finally - Fournier with a big bucket from 3pt range! They needed that, France. Remarkably he\u2019s 1/9 from 2pt range, 2/2 from three. Third quarter 2 min - France 23-38 Australia Delly drives at Fournier - France\u2019s star is on three personal fouls, so the Boomers will look to target him. He tries at the other end, Fournier but the defence is too good. Ingles goes around Gobert - and he gives his Utah Jazz teammate a bit of lip! We saw this during the second round clash - is there a bit of niggle between these NBA teammates? Ingles takes the 1pt extra from the stripe. Great start, Boomers. They\u2019re out to a game-high 15 lead. Second half! We\u2019re back on court and it\u2019s first points from Kay - just as in the first half! Bogut the assist, and he\u2019s fouled en route! Adds one from the stripe. Gobert misses the last of the half, but it\u2019s Ingles with the final score from Australia! Good D from Bogut at the end - the French wanted a foul. Ingles 12 points, Mills with eight and Fournier eight as well, but shooting 2/9. France need him to lift. Second quarter 9 min - France 21-28 Australia Fournier sinks a three! Is he finding his range? Meanwhile Ingles grabs another two - he\u2019s the best on court so far tonight, Jingles. Dellavdeova draws a foul from Gobert. He\u2019s so tough, mentally, Delly - he\u2019s a terrier. And big Rudy looks a bit off it tonight. Dellavdeova pulls up short on a shot but he hustles and harries Fournier to slow the quick transition! What energy. Second quarter 7 min - France 18-26 Australia Ingles again with two - he\u2019s in a mood tonight, which is promising for Australian fans! Gobert goes to the stripe - but he misses both. Is he struggling tonight, the 7ft-er? Australia get the rebound and it\u2019s Landale who goes over the big man at the other end! Time out, France. Second quarter 5 min - France 18-22 Australia A lot of shots missing and not much better from the stripe from either side. Finally Fournier grabs 3/3 from the paint. They\u2019re warming up here, France. Second quarter 4 min - France 15-21 Australia Huge block from Boguy on De Colo! Kay concedes the foul, but France can\u2019t capitalise. Creek doing a job defensively on Fournier, but Labeyrie dunks! Ingles hits two at the other end, we\u2019re back to six the difference. Second quarter 2 min - France 13-19 Australia Fournier goes up but he misses again - 1/5 from the field for France\u2019s star. Boomers also pass the chance at an early score, before Joe Ingles finally drops a three! Australia need him back in a rhythm, hot-hands Joe went missing against Spain. Finally Fournier drops a 2-pointer for France. A bright start from the Boomers who go to the first break five ahead. It\u2019s been a grind to start - both sides having to rise above the psychological blow of missing the gold-medal game. First quarter 7 min - France 8-13 Australia I\u2019d love to tell you a bit more but my internet\u2019s gone on the fritz. Australia out by five, as Baynes and Goulding come into the contest for the Boomers. First quarter 4 min - France 4-7 Australia Fournier gets France on the board, before Batum doubles fire, and it\u2019s Mills again at the other end for Australia. Gobert turns it over - it\u2019s been a tired start from the \u201cStifle Tower\u201d before Bogut misses the tip in off Mills\u2019 shot. Expect fatigue to be a factor tonight - what is this, the eighth game for both these sides in about two weeks? First quarter 2 min - France 0-5 Australia And it\u2019s first points - Nic Kay! He starts ahead of Lansdale, a reward for his terrific showing against Spain, and who\u2019s next? It\u2019s Patty Mills from the pocket with the first three of the game. First tip! Australia start with ball in hand - the Chinese boo-boys are back in action, and it\u2019s an early offensive foul called against the big man, Bogut, for blocking France\u2019s star, Fournier. They will forever be remembered as the team that slayed the USA, but can France grab a bronze medal for their efforts? And can the Boomers lift after another morale-sapping loss to Spain, in double overtime too? Our players are on the court - Bogut comes in for Aron Baynes for the Boomers. Here. We. Go! I\u2019d love to rake the embers on that one - what a remarkable NRL finals performance, but it\u2019s a hard gear change now on Sportswatch. We\u2019re off to China and to the bronze-medal match at the Basketball World Cup. It\u2019s Australia v France - the game nobody wants to be in, but there\u2019s a pretty significant reward for the winner - especially the Boomers, who you\u2019ll remember have never won a senior men\u2019s medal at an Olympics or a World Cup. What. To. Say. That was something, and then something else again. What a complete performance from the Eels. Almost the perfect 80 minutes. Attacking intent - skill in the halves, and terrific discipline to not concede. Points from everywhere. They\u2019ll be watching the tape on this one - the Storm. There\u2019s a blue &amp; gold army heading south to Melbourne next week! Try! Parramatta 58-0 Brisbane (Alvaro) 79 min: That was pure determination - Alvaro set it up with a terrific run, and he\u2019s got his personal reward, and Anthony Seibold has just walked out of the coach\u2019s box. They\u2019re shattered, the Broncos. And they give Manu Ma\u2019a the final kick - a nice touch. And it\u2019s ugly - but it crawls over! Try! Parramatta 52-0 Brisbane (Brown) 76 min: You worried the floodgates would open after that Moeroa try, and they have. Lovely stuff from the young half, Brown and he treats himself to a second. Moses from dead in front: 6/11 inching a much better percentage. Try! Parramatta 46-0 Brisbane (Moses) 73 min: Terrific from Takarangi and great vision from Mahoney, who puts Moses in a hole! He\u2019s popping up everywhere. And he hits that one right over the black dot - that\u2019s better from Moses. Try! Parramatta 40-0 Brisbane (Moeroa) 69 min: Still plenty of work going in here - and the Eels aren\u2019t letting up at all. This could get nasty, late on. It\u2019s the big basher off the interchange bench who finishes it, and Moses enjoys another easier one from near in front to lift his average with the kick. 64 min: The veteran, Brad Takarangi, goes ever so close! Ach, of anyone who deserves a try, how bout this bloke. He\u2019s pulled down a few metres out and Brisbane suck in the big ones. 61 min: 29,372 in at Bankwest Stadium in Parramatta. The SFS rebuild might be turning into an absolute white elephant but at least they got this one right. Wait til the Wanderers get 30,000 in. Heaving. 58 min: It\u2019s almost like that try has made Brisbane realise the day\u2019s officially over, and somehow released the pressure valve. Or it\u2019s a dead cat bounce. Either way, this is the best they\u2019ve looked in this game so far. Yet Parramatta still come. 55 min: And they\u2019re gluttons for punishment, Brisbane as they go for the short kickoff - and regather. But the tryline begging they\u2019ve put a pass behind the winger Isaako and any chance is snuffed out. Try! Parramatta 34-0 Brisbane (Brown) Blow it up, refs. Somebody stop the fight. It\u2019s a Gutherson bust, he looks around for support and finds the teenager Dylan Brown backing up on the inside. And Moses gives a sigh of relief for finally getting one in front of the posts. He kicks it - 3/8 now. Try! Parramatta 28-0 Brisbane (Sivo) 49 min: Wowee. Where do they find these Fijian wingers? It seems a lifetime ago since Semi Radradra was rampaging up and down the Parra touchline, but Semi-who - Maika Sivo is on absolute fire - he\u2019s surely close to the hottest wing-property in the NRL. Moses misses again - admittedly, they\u2019re not giving him easy ones. 46 min: We\u2019re back to business as usual as the Eels probe - but it\u2019s Sivo into touch. Moses continues to throw 30m passes - they\u2019re stretching the Broncos side to side, Parramatta. And it\u2019s working for them. 43 min: Mitchell Moses with back to back infringements - he\u2019ll have to be careful. First he hung on too long after Milford made a clever bust, then he tried a one-on-one strip and was too eager. They won\u2019t take the two, Brisbane, so you could say smart play, but he has to be careful. And they get within 10m of the line - seemingly for the first time all game, Brisbane, and we\u2019ve got a ball to ground! Second half! 40 min: Okay, we\u2019re back. What can the Broncos muster now? They need a big start - they have to score first otherwise it\u2019s definitely curtains. So. You\u2019re the coach. Your team\u2019s been absolutely battered. What does Anthony Siebold come up with from here? And spare a thought for Brad Arthur. After everything he\u2019s been through at Parramatta over the past few years. The shenanigans. The controversy. The pressure. The player-power issues. And here he is overseeing a team that\u2019s absolutely rolling in clover out there, in front of a packed-out home crowd that\u2019s loving it. Remarkable. Yikes. Have you seen many better halves of footy than that? It\u2019s been near-flawless stuff from the Eels. If you had to find a criticism though it\u2019s that Moses has left a few points on the field with the boot. 2/5 from conversions and 0/1 penalties. 32-0 would be good night, nurse - but given how instrumental he\u2019s been in most of the plays you can\u2019t really fault the kid. Try! Parramatta 24-0 Brisbane (Sivo) 37 min: There\u2019s some tired legs already out there for Brisbane, they need to get in the sheds and work out what\u2019s gone wrong here. But wait - they\u2019ve not have they! Sivo with a dance down the touchline - it\u2019s a juggle as he almost loses possession - but the NRL\u2019s leading tryscorer adds one more! Try! Parramatta 20-0 Brisbane (Lane) 33 min: Clever stuff again - this is scintillating from Parra! Moses switches the play with a big 30m pass and they work it through the hands - and it\u2019s the Big Man Bun - Shaun Lane, who crashes over! Moses with a decent attempt from near the sideline - it curls a little, but it\u2019s off the post and then down onto the crossbar! Can you get any closer?! No extras. 31 min: This time it\u2019s Gutherson who puts it on the toe - to the same result! Six again. It\u2019s Sisyphus-ian stuff for the Broncos right now. 28 min: They\u2019ll have to defend here again, first though, Brisbane - as the golden boot of Mitch Moses rolls another terrific ball in-goal and they\u2019re forced to concede the repeat set of six. They\u2019ve enjoyed twice as much time with the pill, the Eels - 14 sets to seven. 147 tackles made to 83 - and as if they weren\u2019t already on top, imagine how tired some of these big Bronco forwards will be later in the match. They\u2019re getting through a power of work. 24 min: So. It\u2019s a kaibosh of an opening from the Eels. What can the Broncos muster from here? They need a spark and quickly or their season is over. Who can find it? Try! Parramatta 16-0 Brisbane (Ferguson) 19 min: My, oh my. They\u2019re in again! They\u2019re racing the clock - point-a-minute style, here, Parramatta. It\u2019s a break from deep, and again it finishes off a Moses kick. He looks crossfield, it\u2019s not cleanly collected but Waqa Blake does brilliantly to set up his winger. And the veteran (is he veteran status yet?), Ferguson - finishes! No extras from the sideline. Your move, Broncos. Try! Parramatta 12-0 Brisbane (Moses) 16 min: Ooh, that\u2019s brilliant from Moses! They\u2019ve parted like the Arabian desert, Brisbane - he faked to kick right and dropped the most delicate of grubbers, only to regather and ground just ahead of the defence. What a way to say \u201cSorry lads\u201d after that missed penalty! He slots the conversion. It\u2019s all Parra! 15 min: Penalty against Brisbane, Ofahengaue is late on Moses as he looks to kick. It wasn\u2019t spiteful, but it is a heavy fall for the halfback. Moses dusts himself off and duly looks to slot the extra two. But he\u2019 misses the penalty! Try! Parramatta 6-0 Brisbane (Jennings) 11 min: An early ebb and flow settling in here - Parra with the better metres and attacking intent. And now Ferguson sparks the bust! They\u2019ve got numbers here, it\u2019s 3 on 2, but who comes up with the big tackle - it\u2019s Payne Haas! Incredible recovery from the front rower. Mitchell Moses goes to the sky on the next play, crossfield, he looks for Jennings who claims on the juggle - a back-bending grab and plant - terrific footy, Eels! Moses adds the extras from just off to the left. 7 min: Mushka! Big hit, Matt Gillett (the best a man can get). And Parra look for the final play grubber, but it ricochets off a pack of legs and falls harmlessly into a Bronco arms. The Eels come again, and it\u2019s the rapid fridge, Maika Sivo who is pulled short by inches! What a wrecking ball - he carried about three of them like sherpas. 5 min: The Broncos survive. A suspected high shot on Milford, but it goes unpaid. And it\u2019s first penalty against Brisbane. It\u2019s Parramatta that have started brighter - what can they make of this good early opportunity. 2 min: Both sides get through their first sets, it\u2019s Parra who roll a well-weighted kick into the corner, about 10m of the Broncos line. Can they pinch a scrum feed? We miraculously saw that a few weekends back (can anyone remember what game that was?) Alas, no. Brisbane bring it out from their line. But Reed Mahoney comes up with a huge play - he\u2019s caught Milford on the final tackle before he could kick, and it\u2019s the Eels with ball in hand with only 50m to get through. Kick off! And it is Gutherson who gets us underway! Broncos receive, under a slight pall of fireworks smoke. Thankfully no Joey Leilua-style incidents (see yesterday) today. The new-look Parra stadium is our venue to determine who gets a playdate with Melbourne Storm next week after their surprise loss to Canberra yesterday. Doesn\u2019t it look a sight, resplendent in blue and yellow, with a smattering of Broncos\u2019 orange. You can\u2019t beat sold-out stadiums. Gutherson leads out the Eels. We have our players out on the field and first whistle can\u2019t be too far away. Kia ora! A lovely welcome to you all and thanks JP for those kindly words. I don\u2019t know why but I read that opening line very much as per the stylings of Gil Heron Scott. Your humble scribe will hope to deliver. We\u2019re not far away from the final NRL elimination final of the weekend - it\u2019s Parramatta hosting Brisbane, 5 v 8, and we\u2019ll have it all for you, here on Sportwatch! Ok, the next words you see will have been typed by Richard Parkin. Thank you for your company today and a thoroughly entertaining Super Netball grand final. Enjoy the rugby league! Phew! That was fun. Time to get our breath back and regroup for the afternoon\u2019s NRL action. The Eels and Broncos will be underway in about 20 minutes. Richard Parkin will join in for that one. Here\u2019s Erin Delahunty\u2019s report from courtside at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre. Sam Wallace has been named as the player of the match for her 40 goals and dominant display in the circle. Erin Delahunty was courtside in Brisbane, her match report will be up shortly. It ends 64-47 in favour of the visitors. What an astonishing result. Q4: 4 mins remaining: Lightning 43-59 Swifts - Muhammad Ali once bragged that he handcuffed lightning but Sarah Klau has done just that over four imperious quarters in the Super Netball grand final. She is leading her Swifts to an incredible victory. Q4: 7 mins remaining: Lightning 40-56 Swifts - It is definitely party time now. Haythornthwaite robs the Lightning as if she was hiding in plain sight then goal after goal rains down on the home circle. This is an emphatic drubbing now. Time out called by Noeline Taurua but it is too little too late. Q4: 10 mins remaining: Lightning 38-51 Swifts - The time out worked superbly, drawing the sting out of the contest and allowing the Swifts to regroup. Wallace and Housby take advantage, continuing their excellent afternoons. It\u2019s almost party time now for NSW. Q4: 11.45 mins remaining: Lightning 38-48 Swifts - Swifts time out just as the Lightning were building a head of steam. Briony Akle has controlled this contest superbly. \u201cJust stay in the moment\u201d she demands as the NSW huddle breaks away. Q4: 13 mins remaining: Lightning 36-48 Swifts - The final quarter begins with the Lightning missing a shot at goal at one end and Housby making them pay with a brace at the other. The margin out to 12. Klau\u2019s reached 100 Nissan Net Points. Four rebounds, five interceptions, and a presence that has rattled the Lightning. Seriously impressive. This has been such an impressive display from the Swifts and they are on course for a comprehensive upset victory over the Lightning. That\u2019s three quarters in a row in favour of the visitors and the 2019 Super Netball championship is within reach. Q3: 3 mins remaining: Lightning 33-41 Swifts - The defending champions have had two or three bursts of pressure this afternoon but every time the Swifts have absorbed the pressure and come out the other side. They do so again with Housby once again influencing at one end and Klau marshalling the other. Klau is absolutely bossing this. So so impressive. Q3: 6 mins remaining: Lightning 31-39 Swifts - The Lightning are in the middle of a handy burst. Maweni secures her first clean intercept of the game to set up an attack that ends with the margin cut to six goals. It should be five but Klau yet again comes to her team\u2019s rescue - what a match she is putting in - five intercepts now! Q3: 9.30 mins remaining: Lightning 28-36 Swifts - Time out Swifts. During the break Briony Akle exudes confidence and good cheer. She singles out Klau who must now be favourite to collect player of the match honours. Q3: 10 mins remaining: Lightning 27-36 Swifts - Turnovers at both ends again rouse the crowd but the Swifts settle. Wallace has been dominant in the circle all day. Q3: 13 mins remaining: Lightning 24-33 Swifts - \u201cThis is about us\u201d Noeline Taurua tells her troops before the second half gets underway but the Lightning concede the opening two goals of the third quarter as the grand final starts to leak away from the minor premiers. The stats at half-time favour the Swifts, as you would expect with an eight-goal lead. Individually Klau, Haythorthwaite, and Wallace are leading the Nissan Net Points. Woah! Wood is called for footwork when the margin look destined to be cut to three. Instead Wallace hits the rim then recovers superbly to extend the Swifts\u2019s lead to five. That becomes six, then seven, and with the final play of the half eight! What a finish by the Swifts, resisting that challenge from the Lightning and hitting back late. A four goal margin at quarter-time has double by the main break. Q2: 3 mins remaining: Lightning 23-27 Swifts - Errors in both circles slow the scoreboard. The Lightning respond by recalling Steph Wood in place of Cara Koenen. For the Swifts Garbin is on for Housby. Q2: 6 mins remaining: Lightning 21-25 Swifts - The visitors have lost their early fluency in possession but they are fighting hard to retain their slender lead. A midcourt turnover helps shift the momentum of the quarter. Wallace is up to 16 from 17. Q2: 8.30 mins remaining: Lightning 19-21 Swifts - The momentum is now all with the Lightning. They\u2019re attacking at speed and forcing the Swifts into awkward chains of possession. Pretorius has been immense this quarter and her presence is making the Swifts over-possess around the circle. Time out called by the Lightning. Q2: 10 mins remaining: Lightning 18-20 Swifts - Turnover after turnover has the crowd on its feet and after scares at both ends of the court the chaos favours the Lightning. Proscovia has been flawless since her introduction. Q2: 13 mins remaining: Lightning 15-17 Swifts - The Swifts think there\u2019s a steal in the opening possession of the quarter but the umpires find a footwork penalty and the Lightning dodge a bullet. The Swifts\u2019s pain is reinforced with an error from the centre restart and the Lightning pull within just two goals. What a start from the Swifts! The Lightning began the day as hot favourites but they have plenty of work to do now against a determined NSW opposition. Defensively the Swifts have been outstanding, led by Klau, their ball movement channeled through Housby has been slick, and Wallace is shooting 10 from 11. For the Lightning, Peace Proscovia has come on at GS, Cara Koenen has moved to GA, Steph Wood has come off. Q1: 3 mins remaining: Lightning 8-13 Swifts - Klau is on fire, setting up the Swifts for another rebound that\u2019s rewarded after some patient build-up play. But the Lightning are working their way into the contest and finally bag two in a row with quarter-time approaching. Q1: 6 mins remaining: Lightning 6-11 Swifts - Straight after the restart Wood fluffs her line under the net and yet again the Swifts are brutal, punishing every mistake. The first NSW handling error offers Sunshine Coast the chance of back-to-back goals for the first time today but Klau does superbly in the circle to maintain the Swifts\u2019s ascendancy. Q1: 9 mins remaining: Lightning 4-9 Swifts - Housby is all action for the Swifts and she nets her 700th of the season. At the other end of the court Koenen is growing into the contest and her relationship with Langman is already proving crucial. But a contact penalty against the Lightning shooter earns the Swifts another turnover and Wallace finishes off an end-to-end passage of play. That forces the first time out of the day and there\u2019s plenty of work for Noeline Taurua in the huddle. Q1: 11 mins remaining: Lightning 3-5 Swifts - The Lightning are lacking a little composure in these early exchanges but they\u2019re hanging tough. The Swifts are pinging the ball around with intent. Q1: 13 mins remaining: Lightning 1-3 Swifts - Superb start from the visitors, scoring within seconds of the opening possession then turning a turnover into a goal as soon as the Lightning see the ball. The Super Netball grand final is underway! The national anthem has been sung, the huddles are underway, the Suncorp Super Netball grand final is seconds away... The teams are making their way out onto the court. The Swifts are out first to a ripple of applause but the noise is deafening when the Lightning emerge. The grand final umpires are Michelle Phippard and Helen George. The Nissan Net Points team of the Super Netball season has just been revealed. It\u2019s further confirmation of the importance of the duel between Karla Pretorius and Helen Housby. The head-to-head record strongly favours the Lightning. They\u2019ve won this match-up four times in a row, including three victories this season. However, the wins back in rounds four and 11 were by just two goals. The Starting Sevens are in: That world class defence and the luxury of Peace Proscovia on the bench - it\u2019s little wonder the Lightning have been the dominant force this season. \u201cIt\u2019s a day of celebration,\u201d Laura Langman says in her prematch interview, \u201ca chance for all of us to say thank you to Noeline Taurua.\u201d \u201cIn the semi-final she showed me up, but it\u2019s a team game\u201d says Swifts skipper Paige Hadley about her head-to-head battle with Langman. Wilma Shakespear and Vicki Wilson have just brought the Suncorp Super Netball trophy into the Brisbane Entertainment Centre. We\u2019ll be underway in the grand final in not time at all. Here\u2019s Erin Delahunty\u2019s grand final preview, highlighting the significance of the duel between the Lightning\u2019s Karla Pretorius and the Swifts\u2019s Helen Housby. A single match-up rarely dictates the outcome of any game, but in Sunday\u2019s Super Netball decider, the contest between Helen Housby and the world\u2019s best goal defence, Karla Pretorius, could do precisely that. The head-to-head between the NSW Swifts\u2019 goal attack, still struggling with a thigh injury sustained at July\u2019s World Cup, and the tenacious Sunshine Coast Lightning defender, named the best player of that tournament in Liverpool, is tantalising. Hello everybody and welcome to a special grand final edition of Sunday sportwatch. Yes, there is plenty going on today but nothing more important than the highpoint of the Super Netball calendar when the Lightning host the Swifts shortly after 1pm for the right to call themselves the best side in Australia. We\u2019ll be paying close attention to that from the get-go, after which we can divert our attention elsewhere, like the Ashes, or Australia\u2019s women\u2019s T20 international in the West Indies, or yesterday\u2019s dramatic NRL and AFL finals. By 4pm we\u2019re back into the live stuff with the Eels hosting the Broncos in the last NRL final of the weekend. Then we\u2019re into the business end of the Basketball World Cup from 6pm before turning our attention once again to the Oval for what may prove to be the final day of Ashes action this year. Please keep me company throughout the afternoon, either on Twitter @JPHowcroft, or by email: jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com. Comments should also be open below the line.",

      "body": "<p>One Friday afternoon early this summer I drove down from Toulouse to a village called Homps, east of Carcassonne, parked in a narrow, cobbled lane in the hot sun and wandered across a shaded square into the cool kitchen of a house beside the Canal du Midi. That afternoon, the house had become an outpost of London\u2019s most distinctive and influential restaurant, St John. The grainy grey light of Smithfield meat market had been swapped for a big Mediterranean sky, but the intense \u201cnose to tail\u201d spirit of the London restaurant prevailed.</p> <p>In the kitchen, Fergus Henderson, St John\u2019s indomitable philosopher-in-chief, was working alongside his Canadian head chef, Steve Darou and a posse of staff and friends, using kitchen scissors to nip the heads and snip the backbones from 120 quail. The quail \u2013 set aside to marinate on a layered bed of parsley stalks, sliced garlic and olive oil \u2013 would form the centrepiece of the St John\u2019s annual <em>f\u00eate du vin</em> the next day.</p> <p>For the regulars at this event, now in its sixth year, the feast has become a pilgrimage, and like all pilgrimages it is as much about storytelling as destination. No sooner have I arrived in the kitchen, therefore, than I am regaled with fete<em> </em>legends. The year that the lunch up in the hills ended at the local firemen\u2019s ball in the early hours, an event involving Johnny Hallyday karaoke and paddling pools full of ros\u00e9; the year that one particularly gobby English food writer was decked mid-sentence by a local octogenarian vigneron; the year the editor of this magazine locked everyone out of their hotel and went awol with their keys; the year of the naked Dutchman (a convoluted story involving a jacuzzi and a dozen takeaway pizzas).</p> <p>The house in Homps belongs to Trevor Gulliver, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/17/st-john-at-20-five-rules-nose-to-tail-culinary-revolution\" title=\"\">who established St John with Henderson a quarter of a century ago</a> and who has been equally integral to its own story ever since, not least to its French-only wine list (\u201cFergus puts it on the plate and I put it in the glass,\u201d says Gulliver). In 2010 Gulliver fulfilled a long-held ambition and established St John\u2019s own winery here in the Minervois. When I arrive he is on his way back down from the St John vineyards, which are up on a high ridge in the foothills of the Montagne noire, Cathar country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"82ca638cebbf688f220734d689e299ca90bc9947\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82ca638cebbf688f220734d689e299ca90bc9947/0_579_3840_4797/801.jpg\" alt=\"St John\u2019s vineyard for their Boulevard Napoleon winery\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St John\u2019s vineyard for their Boulevard Napoleon winery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam A Harris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To celebrate their achievement in putting heart and brains into British cooking for 25 years Henderson and Gulliver are about to publish <em>The Book of St John</em>, part food gospel, part memoir, part recipe book. I have carried a draft of it with me as a kind of Baedeker for the weekend. In among the tales of devilled kidneys and brine buckets and all things pig there is a fine photograph of the two of them facing the entrance of St John, backs to the world; Henderson in his chalkstripe suit, Gulliver in a worsted tweed. Both men are pugnacious in silhouette; Gulliver was a prop forward in Richmond\u2019s first XV and has the recent hip replacement to prove it. Seen together they have something in common with that other east London pairing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/jun/09/art.gilbertandgeorge\" title=\"\">Gilbert and George</a>. And like the artists \u2013 as they insist in their book, and in person \u2013 what they do is always more important than what they say.</p> <p>I get my first lesson in that principle when Gulliver arrives back and gives me a tour of the house, part of which is built into a medieval church. He and Henderson, in the kitchen, immediately fall into their singular double act. As a result of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/feb/26/foodanddrink.features6\" title=\"\">Parkinson\u2019s disease that first afflicted him 20 years ago</a>, Henderson finds sustained conversation a challenge, though he is the most active of listeners, and his devoted staff hang on his every measured word and gesture, particularly where questions of taste are involved. Gulliver, meanwhile, is the storyteller\u2019s equivalent of a chainsmoker \u2013 one anecdote is lit from the last, and three tales about local folklore, London restaurant politics and long lunches past are always on the go at once.</p> <p>At the heart of their relationship \u2013 which began through an introduction from an olive oil seller and, inevitably, a long lunch \u2013 is a shared faith in the sustaining joys of life. Both men are steeped in what you might call the rigour of gastronomic pleasure. The articles of St John\u2019s faith are all about constancy and conviction, doing good things extremely well. When they first opened the restaurant, with its menu of tripes and bone marrow and welsh rarebit and addictive custard, they were accused of being 200 years out of date, which they took as an enormous compliment.</p> <p>One of their key beliefs is that a great restaurant should insist on making a human shape to the day, beginning early with the baking of bread, and ending late with a final glass of something special. In an age of working lunches and clean eating, they have held fast to that principle. As a young man Henderson studied architecture \u2013 both his parents were architects \u2013 and he carried a profound understanding of structure into his eventual vocation. The foundations of that, he suggests to me as he works, were boyhood holidays to the Dordogne, where each morning the family would crack open the Michelin guide and ask the only two questions that ever really mattered: \u201cWhere shall we have lunch?\u201d and \u201cWhere shall we have dinner?\u201d</p> <p>Though St John \u2013 and its offspring, St John Bread and Wine in Spitalfields, and the St John Bakery \u2013 is in some ways the most English of restaurants, it has a Francophile devotion to daily ritual. Henderson insists, for example, on the lost art of elevenses \u2013 a seed cake and a glass of madeira add a comfort and sharpness to each morning \u2013 and he brings that understanding of the perfect pace of small pleasures to the weekend\u2019s events in France.</p> <p>The <em>f\u00eate du vin</em> was established as a thank you to La Lavini\u00e8re, the hillside village in which the St John winery is based. In the six years since, spontaneous adventure has matured into tradition. The pilgrimage has much-loved stations of the cross. Starting point for the weekend\u2019s festivities is Gilbert\u2019s, confidently believed by Gulliver and Henderson to be the \u201cbest bar in the world\u201d. The party, numbering now a couple of dozen, travels, as tradition demands, from Homps up to the hills in convoy, not least because Gilbert\u2019s is not known to satnav. There is a little excitement on the way there when our minibus is forced off a single-track road and into a ditch by a determined farmer\u2019s wife in a Renault, who will not give a centimetre. The assembled party ends up lifting the rear axle back to the road; Henderson is stranded for a moment on the far side of the ditch, before being half piggy-backed to the road.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ac298542a14d4bb0a4879896293d9710e992ed4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ac298542a14d4bb0a4879896293d9710e992ed4/149_600_3616_4520/800.jpg\" alt=\"Fergus Henderson outside Gilbert\u2019s, his favourite bar\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fergus Henderson outside Gilbert\u2019s, his favourite bar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam A Harris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gilbert\u2019s lives up to its billing. It has an interior that would have made Cezanne\u2019s card players feel right at home. There are ancient football scarves on the walls, a destitute museum of rabbit rotisseries on one table, a 20-year-old cat on another. Music is provided by a jukebox that only takes old-style francs. There is one pression beer on tap, and a row of pastis and digestifs on a shelf. Gilbert, the proprietor and sole barman, works in the neighbouring vineyard by day and opens the bar at night. He has been doing that every day, he tells me, without complaint, for 43 years.</p> <p>You can see why that dedication might appeal to Henderson and Gulliver, though they flinch at the suggestion that St John is on its way to becoming an equally venerable institution. They took their initial inspiration from the classic French brasseries, Henderson suggests. \u201cWe had a sense of what a restaurant should be,\u201d Gulliver says. \u201cIt should be an old friend. And everything about it should matter.\u201d He is a little scathing of the concept of the pop-up eatery. He defines the ethos of St John as much by what it does not do, as what it does: \u201cNo, we will not \u2018roll out\u2019 St John Bread and Wine. No, we will never introduce \u2018set lunch\u2019 menus. And no, we never cook salmon or scallops [because they are] easy sells that have no magic.\u201d</p> <p>The day of the fete begins for Henderson with a sharpener at the Caf\u00e9 de la Poste before we all head up to La Lavini\u00e8re, and the winery, at lunchtime. The vineyard is mostly Gulliver\u2019s obsession. He started his business career in rock\u2019n\u2019roll merchandise; when he opened the landmark Fire Station restaurant down by London\u2019s Old Vic in 1990, he looked at importing his own wines, but at the time the wine trade was in the hands of one or two suppliers. When he joined forces with Henderson, however, Gulliver was determined the spirit that informed the food at St John \u2013 built on close relationships with a family of trusted farmers and suppliers \u2013 had equally to be applied to the wine list.</p> <p>Gulliver drove a hire car around Burgundy and the Languedoc every summer establishing relationships with growers. \u201cYears of knocking on doors and late, wine-sodden nights,\u201d he recalls. \u201cOver time you build up shared memories: \u2018Do you remember that 4am drive home from the hills? The year it hailed during harvest?\u2019\u201d Gulliver learned a few important lessons on these travels: one was that it is always the little dog that will bite you when you climb out of the car in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere. Another was that you can buy the greatest wine in Burgundy but if you leave it on a pallet at Calais for three days in the sun, it will be the worst cooking plonk by the time it arrives in London.</p> <p>The St John winery is set into the ramparts of La Lavini\u00e8re. Gulliver discovered it derelict and for sale; it was love at first sight. He and his two young sons spent the summer of 2010 cleaning out the old wine tanks. As with St John, the name of the operation was suggested by the street on which it stands: Boulevard Napoleon. Gulliver made three years of wine before producing a bottle that brought a smile to Henderson\u2019s face.</p> <p>On the Saturday of the fete a crowd has already assembled in the Napoleon courtyard sampling the vintages that have followed. The guests include villagers and winegrower friends. Guest of honour is the mayor (\u201cRule number one in France,\u201d says Henderson, \u201calways make friends with the mayor.\u201d) and his wife who bustles in with her home-baked <em>oreillettes</em>, a Minervois delicacy of deep-fried wafers, flavoured with orange water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5fb8b738fa1184126c471f4a93157a67db4a0714%3Fcrop%3D95_781_3662_4575&amp;left-caption=On%20the%20grill%20at%20La%20Lavini%C3%A8re.%20&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F97313ef0344262593b5e0dac0b376ea1c72da395%3Fcrop%3D86_113_3692_4613&amp;right-caption=Grilled%20quail.%20Photographs%3A%20Sam%20A%20Harris&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"St John\u2019s annual f\u00eate du vin\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5fb8b738fa1184126c471f4a93157a67db4a0714%3Fcrop%3D95_781_3662_4575&left-caption=On%20the%20grill%20at%20La%20Lavini%C3%A8re.%20&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F97313ef0344262593b5e0dac0b376ea1c72da395%3Fcrop%3D86_113_3692_4613&right-caption=Grilled%20quail.%20Photographs%3A%20Sam%20A%20Harris&always-place-captions-below=false\">St John\u2019s annual f\u00eate du vin</a> </figure>  <p>The sun is hot and Gulliver, in a straw hat, is manning the fire of old vines over which the quail will be roasted (\u201cYou can tell they are done when the blush goes from their armpits\u201d). Inside, behind great oak doors, among the wine vats two trestle tables have been set up in the cool. Henderson is in a makeshift kitchen hefting, with concentrated determination, a bucket of green beans into a pan. You are reminded, watching him, that he was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s just five years after they set up St John, aged only 36. He and his wife Margot \u2013 with whom he had made his name cooking at the French House in Soho \u2013 had three young children. \u201cWhat a bugger it was,\u201d he says of the diagnosis, in his book, \u201cnot just for me but for everyone in my kitchen \u2013 as time went on I increasingly became a flailing nutter, losing order slips and terrifying chefs in proximity to me every time I picked up a knife.\u201d His condition was improved and stabilised with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/feb/26/foodanddrink.features6\" title=\"\">pioneering use of electrodes in his head</a>. \u201cDeep brain stimulation was a life-transforming miracle: I no longer flail, but I am slow. Too slow for the kitchen.\u201d</p> <p>There is an enduring poignancy to watching him work, seeing him in his element, as if he has found in the calamity of his illness a kind of metier and purpose. Over the course of the weekend, and later during a typically long lunch with him and Gulliver at St John, I ask a couple of times about might have beens, about the undoubted frustrations of his life. He does not answer directly, though at one point, at that later lunch, by way of reply he simply gestures around the restaurant, as if to say: \u201cWhat is not to love about this life?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F536bc4447b82c1b5f149f8853a6c87a14005bf2b%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3840_4797&amp;left-caption=Vegetable%20prep.&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5b987fdaee64f3b8cee1eb28b468013e96d9fa54%3Fcrop%3D0_466_3785_4729&amp;right-caption=The%20fete%20in%20full%20swing.%20Photographs%3A%20Sam%20A%20Harris&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"St John\u2019s annual f\u00eate du vin\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F536bc4447b82c1b5f149f8853a6c87a14005bf2b%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3840_4797&left-caption=Vegetable%20prep.&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5b987fdaee64f3b8cee1eb28b468013e96d9fa54%3Fcrop%3D0_466_3785_4729&right-caption=The%20fete%20in%20full%20swing.%20Photographs%3A%20Sam%20A%20Harris&always-place-captions-below=false\">St John\u2019s annual f\u00eate du vin</a> </figure>  <p>The fete lunch begins with lamb\u2019s brains on toast, with fresh parsley and wild garlic, a dish which becomes a kind of triumphant symbol of that latter sentiment. \u201cEvery time I eat brains (which I do as frequently as possible),\u201d says Henderson, \u201cI think of what wondrous things they are: imagine eating a cloud, for which you have managed to form a crisp exterior. Another miracle \u2013 this time textural!\u201d</p> <p>The simple miracles keep coming over lunch and long into the afternoon \u2013 the platters of quail on a bed of green beans, the great bowls of Carcassonne cherries on ice, the slabs of local cheese, and bottle after bottle of St John wine. The St John philosophy has been boiled down \u2013 reduced \u2013 to \u201cnose-to-tail\u201d as if it is simply an approach to using every last part of \u201cthe pivotal pig\u201d. It is more than that, though, as Henderson insists: \u201cIt is a way of being in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f43c6e25ca78065d79250900a9194e02220cd15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f43c6e25ca78065d79250900a9194e02220cd15/394_1985_4010_5012/800.jpg\" alt=\"Fergus Henderson and Trevor Gulliver\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One thing the fete proves is that the way of being which St John celebrates is entirely exportable. The lunch eventually ends in the early evening with a hair-raising drive down the hillside; in the absence of the firemen\u2019s shindig the night continues at the Caf\u00e9 de la Poste. There are more traditions to enjoy; the next morning, Gulliver rattles me up the mountain tracks to the vineyard, while Henderson enjoys his morning madeira. Then the previous day\u2019s survivors head, as ever, to Carcassonne for soothing cassoulet. The weekend, I have realised by now, works on the same principle as the restaurant it celebrates: if it works, why ever change it? I\u2019m intrigued that after 25 years, Henderson and Gulliver still eat most days at St John. When I ask why, Gulliver replies, bluntly and in all honesty: \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Henderson, in the book, provides a fuller version of that sentiment, the best endorsement any chef could offer: \u201cStanding in the open kitchen it used to take every scrap of willpower that I could muster to prevent myself from jumping over the pass to join the throngs for lunch. There they were in front of me, swilling glasses of burgundy and chomping happily! I was consumed with quivering envy every day \u2013 it was almost more than I could bear.\u201d His illness provided him with the perfect excuse to join them whenever he wished. \u201cSo you see,\u201d he declares, \u201cit\u2019s not all bad!\u201d We can all drink to that.</p> <h2>\u2018What better education could a chef have?\u2019 \u2013 St John alumni reflect on their time there</h2> <p><strong><br>Ravneet Gill, pastry chef and founder of Countertalk: St John 2015-2016<br></strong>I was about to leave the restaurant industry when I applied for a baking job at St John. It was meant to be an interim position but I loved it so much that I ended up staying for a year and a half \u2013 it made me want to continue working as a chef.</p> <p>We used to joke that St John cares more about their staff than their customers. You\u2019re encouraged to be friends and socialise outside of work. They make great staff food \u2013 toad in the hole, mushrooms on toast, carrot and coriander soup, a full English breakfast every Monday \u2013 and after your shift you can have a drink at the bar, cost price. The ethos seems to have always been there \u2013 I think it filtered down from Fergus Henderson. He\u2019s always very approachable, always at the bar, open to talk to anybody.</p> <p>Since then I\u2019ve worked at a couple of restaurants started by St John alumni and they had the same ethos. Last year I set up an organisation called <a href=\"https://countertalk.co.uk/\">Countertalk</a>, which is all about staff welfare and getting people in hospitality better treatment. It\u2019s definitely possible. St John is proof of that.</p> <p><strong>James Lowe, chef-owner of Lyle\u2019s: St John Bread &amp; Wine 2006-2011<br></strong>When I first ate there in 2003, the choices they were making weren\u2019t obvious. At the time everyone was obsessed with Gordon Ramsay and super-fancy food whereas Fergus\u2019s food was very bare-boned, based on flavour and simplicity. Nose-to-tail cookery is what St John has become synonymous with, but I\u2019d go further and say the food is very commonsense. That\u2019s the way we describe our food at Lyle\u2019s. We\u2019re very careful with what we throw away. There\u2019s a real focus on, is it true to its ingredients? Have we made sure it\u2019s not too fancy? These are all things carried over from St John.</p> <p>Within six months of starting at Bread &amp; Wine as sous chef, I ended up taking over the kitchen. I felt untested, but it was an opportunity to learn. I always thought of it as my own restaurant \u2013 and now at Lyle\u2019s, I really want the people I work with to feel like it\u2019s their restaurant too. I love Fergus\u2019s idea that people within a restaurant are what give it character. They hired people based on personalities rather than CVs, and I learned to see the value in that. It makes for a more interesting team, and hopefully better food.</p> <p>When I started cooking, I was told that kitchens were environments where bullying was rife and you had to work mad hours. It was easy for me not to go down that route: Fergus didn\u2019t have bullying in the kitchen; St John had a six-shift week. They just challenged all the norms.</p> <p><strong>Lee Tiernan, chef-owner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/14/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-black-axe-mangal-lee-tiernan-turkish-british-bone-marrow-st-john-legacy\">Black Axe Mangal</a>: St John Bread &amp; Wine 2003-2013<br></strong>I was at catering college in south London in 2003 and needed to do a two-week stage in a restaurant to complete my qualification. I called St John to see if they\u2019d take me. I didn\u2019t think for one minute that they\u2019d offer me a full-time position, because I didn\u2019t know my arse from my elbow, but four days into my stint, one of the chefs handed in his notice and the head chef Ed Lewis said: \u201cDo you want a job?\u201d</p> <p>One of the first things I had to do was butcher a sirloin and a shoulder of beef. I was shaving and brining pig heads and roasting bone marrow, all sorts of stuff. I remember butchering a Middle White pig one day and throwing the skin away. Ed came over and said: \u201cWe don\u2019t throw anything away here really, nothing gets wasted.\u201d He showed me a box in the walk-in fridge full of skin and salt and said: \u201cIf we have a busy night and I need a starter, I\u2019ve got one here.\u201d As Fergus says, if you\u2019re going to kill an animal, it\u2019s only polite to eat the whole thing. What better education could a young chef have?</p> <p>I left in the autumn of 2013, by which time I was head chef at Bread &amp; Wine, but if I\u2019m honest I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really ever left. I still feel like part of the family. I call Trevor \u201cuncle\u201d, I call Fergus \u201cboss\u201d, and I\u2019ve gotten to know them on a more personal level. I\u2019d like to think that Trevor and Fergus are proud of how my wife Kate, who worked at St John for nine years, and I have carried ourselves since leaving. You don\u2019t want to let your parents down, you want them to be proud of you, and I want Trevor and Fergus to be proud of us as well.</p> <p><em>Interviews by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/killianfox\">Killian Fox</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "One Friday afternoon early this summer I drove down from Toulouse to a village called Homps, east of Carcassonne, parked in a narrow, cobbled lane in the hot sun and wandered across a shaded square into the cool kitchen of a house beside the Canal du Midi. That afternoon, the house had become an outpost of London\u2019s most distinctive and influential restaurant, St John. The grainy grey light of Smithfield meat market had been swapped for a big Mediterranean sky, but the intense \u201cnose to tail\u201d spirit of the London restaurant prevailed. In the kitchen, Fergus Henderson, St John\u2019s indomitable philosopher-in-chief, was working alongside his Canadian head chef, Steve Darou and a posse of staff and friends, using kitchen scissors to nip the heads and snip the backbones from 120 quail. The quail \u2013 set aside to marinate on a layered bed of parsley stalks, sliced garlic and olive oil \u2013 would form the centrepiece of the St John\u2019s annual f\u00eate du vin the next day. For the regulars at this event, now in its sixth year, the feast has become a pilgrimage, and like all pilgrimages it is as much about storytelling as destination. No sooner have I arrived in the kitchen, therefore, than I am regaled with fete legends. The year that the lunch up in the hills ended at the local firemen\u2019s ball in the early hours, an event involving Johnny Hallyday karaoke and paddling pools full of ros\u00e9; the year that one particularly gobby English food writer was decked mid-sentence by a local octogenarian vigneron; the year the editor of this magazine locked everyone out of their hotel and went awol with their keys; the year of the naked Dutchman (a convoluted story involving a jacuzzi and a dozen takeaway pizzas). The house in Homps belongs to Trevor Gulliver, who established St John with Henderson a quarter of a century ago and who has been equally integral to its own story ever since, not least to its French-only wine list (\u201cFergus puts it on the plate and I put it in the glass,\u201d says Gulliver). In 2010 Gulliver fulfilled a long-held ambition and established St John\u2019s own winery here in the Minervois. When I arrive he is on his way back down from the St John vineyards, which are up on a high ridge in the foothills of the Montagne noire, Cathar country. To celebrate their achievement in putting heart and brains into British cooking for 25 years Henderson and Gulliver are about to publish The Book of St John, part food gospel, part memoir, part recipe book. I have carried a draft of it with me as a kind of Baedeker for the weekend. In among the tales of devilled kidneys and brine buckets and all things pig there is a fine photograph of the two of them facing the entrance of St John, backs to the world; Henderson in his chalkstripe suit, Gulliver in a worsted tweed. Both men are pugnacious in silhouette; Gulliver was a prop forward in Richmond\u2019s first XV and has the recent hip replacement to prove it. Seen together they have something in common with that other east London pairing, Gilbert and George. And like the artists \u2013 as they insist in their book, and in person \u2013 what they do is always more important than what they say. I get my first lesson in that principle when Gulliver arrives back and gives me a tour of the house, part of which is built into a medieval church. He and Henderson, in the kitchen, immediately fall into their singular double act. As a result of the Parkinson\u2019s disease that first afflicted him 20 years ago, Henderson finds sustained conversation a challenge, though he is the most active of listeners, and his devoted staff hang on his every measured word and gesture, particularly where questions of taste are involved. Gulliver, meanwhile, is the storyteller\u2019s equivalent of a chainsmoker \u2013 one anecdote is lit from the last, and three tales about local folklore, London restaurant politics and long lunches past are always on the go at once. At the heart of their relationship \u2013 which began through an introduction from an olive oil seller and, inevitably, a long lunch \u2013 is a shared faith in the sustaining joys of life. Both men are steeped in what you might call the rigour of gastronomic pleasure. The articles of St John\u2019s faith are all about constancy and conviction, doing good things extremely well. When they first opened the restaurant, with its menu of tripes and bone marrow and welsh rarebit and addictive custard, they were accused of being 200 years out of date, which they took as an enormous compliment. One of their key beliefs is that a great restaurant should insist on making a human shape to the day, beginning early with the baking of bread, and ending late with a final glass of something special. In an age of working lunches and clean eating, they have held fast to that principle. As a young man Henderson studied architecture \u2013 both his parents were architects \u2013 and he carried a profound understanding of structure into his eventual vocation. The foundations of that, he suggests to me as he works, were boyhood holidays to the Dordogne, where each morning the family would crack open the Michelin guide and ask the only two questions that ever really mattered: \u201cWhere shall we have lunch?\u201d and \u201cWhere shall we have dinner?\u201d Though St John \u2013 and its offspring, St John Bread and Wine in Spitalfields, and the St John Bakery \u2013 is in some ways the most English of restaurants, it has a Francophile devotion to daily ritual. Henderson insists, for example, on the lost art of elevenses \u2013 a seed cake and a glass of madeira add a comfort and sharpness to each morning \u2013 and he brings that understanding of the perfect pace of small pleasures to the weekend\u2019s events in France. The f\u00eate du vin was established as a thank you to La Lavini\u00e8re, the hillside village in which the St John winery is based. In the six years since, spontaneous adventure has matured into tradition. The pilgrimage has much-loved stations of the cross. Starting point for the weekend\u2019s festivities is Gilbert\u2019s, confidently believed by Gulliver and Henderson to be the \u201cbest bar in the world\u201d. The party, numbering now a couple of dozen, travels, as tradition demands, from Homps up to the hills in convoy, not least because Gilbert\u2019s is not known to satnav. There is a little excitement on the way there when our minibus is forced off a single-track road and into a ditch by a determined farmer\u2019s wife in a Renault, who will not give a centimetre. The assembled party ends up lifting the rear axle back to the road; Henderson is stranded for a moment on the far side of the ditch, before being half piggy-backed to the road. Gilbert\u2019s lives up to its billing. It has an interior that would have made Cezanne\u2019s card players feel right at home. There are ancient football scarves on the walls, a destitute museum of rabbit rotisseries on one table, a 20-year-old cat on another. Music is provided by a jukebox that only takes old-style francs. There is one pression beer on tap, and a row of pastis and digestifs on a shelf. Gilbert, the proprietor and sole barman, works in the neighbouring vineyard by day and opens the bar at night. He has been doing that every day, he tells me, without complaint, for 43 years. You can see why that dedication might appeal to Henderson and Gulliver, though they flinch at the suggestion that St John is on its way to becoming an equally venerable institution. They took their initial inspiration from the classic French brasseries, Henderson suggests. \u201cWe had a sense of what a restaurant should be,\u201d Gulliver says. \u201cIt should be an old friend. And everything about it should matter.\u201d He is a little scathing of the concept of the pop-up eatery. He defines the ethos of St John as much by what it does not do, as what it does: \u201cNo, we will not \u2018roll out\u2019 St John Bread and Wine. No, we will never introduce \u2018set lunch\u2019 menus. And no, we never cook salmon or scallops [because they are] easy sells that have no magic.\u201d The day of the fete begins for Henderson with a sharpener at the Caf\u00e9 de la Poste before we all head up to La Lavini\u00e8re, and the winery, at lunchtime. The vineyard is mostly Gulliver\u2019s obsession. He started his business career in rock\u2019n\u2019roll merchandise; when he opened the landmark Fire Station restaurant down by London\u2019s Old Vic in 1990, he looked at importing his own wines, but at the time the wine trade was in the hands of one or two suppliers. When he joined forces with Henderson, however, Gulliver was determined the spirit that informed the food at St John \u2013 built on close relationships with a family of trusted farmers and suppliers \u2013 had equally to be applied to the wine list. Gulliver drove a hire car around Burgundy and the Languedoc every summer establishing relationships with growers. \u201cYears of knocking on doors and late, wine-sodden nights,\u201d he recalls. \u201cOver time you build up shared memories: \u2018Do you remember that 4am drive home from the hills? The year it hailed during harvest?\u2019\u201d Gulliver learned a few important lessons on these travels: one was that it is always the little dog that will bite you when you climb out of the car in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere. Another was that you can buy the greatest wine in Burgundy but if you leave it on a pallet at Calais for three days in the sun, it will be the worst cooking plonk by the time it arrives in London. The St John winery is set into the ramparts of La Lavini\u00e8re. Gulliver discovered it derelict and for sale; it was love at first sight. He and his two young sons spent the summer of 2010 cleaning out the old wine tanks. As with St John, the name of the operation was suggested by the street on which it stands: Boulevard Napoleon. Gulliver made three years of wine before producing a bottle that brought a smile to Henderson\u2019s face. On the Saturday of the fete a crowd has already assembled in the Napoleon courtyard sampling the vintages that have followed. The guests include villagers and winegrower friends. Guest of honour is the mayor (\u201cRule number one in France,\u201d says Henderson, \u201calways make friends with the mayor.\u201d) and his wife who bustles in with her home-baked oreillettes, a Minervois delicacy of deep-fried wafers, flavoured with orange water. The sun is hot and Gulliver, in a straw hat, is manning the fire of old vines over which the quail will be roasted (\u201cYou can tell they are done when the blush goes from their armpits\u201d). Inside, behind great oak doors, among the wine vats two trestle tables have been set up in the cool. Henderson is in a makeshift kitchen hefting, with concentrated determination, a bucket of green beans into a pan. You are reminded, watching him, that he was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s just five years after they set up St John, aged only 36. He and his wife Margot \u2013 with whom he had made his name cooking at the French House in Soho \u2013 had three young children. \u201cWhat a bugger it was,\u201d he says of the diagnosis, in his book, \u201cnot just for me but for everyone in my kitchen \u2013 as time went on I increasingly became a flailing nutter, losing order slips and terrifying chefs in proximity to me every time I picked up a knife.\u201d His condition was improved and stabilised with the pioneering use of electrodes in his head. \u201cDeep brain stimulation was a life-transforming miracle: I no longer flail, but I am slow. Too slow for the kitchen.\u201d There is an enduring poignancy to watching him work, seeing him in his element, as if he has found in the calamity of his illness a kind of metier and purpose. Over the course of the weekend, and later during a typically long lunch with him and Gulliver at St John, I ask a couple of times about might have beens, about the undoubted frustrations of his life. He does not answer directly, though at one point, at that later lunch, by way of reply he simply gestures around the restaurant, as if to say: \u201cWhat is not to love about this life?\u201d The fete lunch begins with lamb\u2019s brains on toast, with fresh parsley and wild garlic, a dish which becomes a kind of triumphant symbol of that latter sentiment. \u201cEvery time I eat brains (which I do as frequently as possible),\u201d says Henderson, \u201cI think of what wondrous things they are: imagine eating a cloud, for which you have managed to form a crisp exterior. Another miracle \u2013 this time textural!\u201d The simple miracles keep coming over lunch and long into the afternoon \u2013 the platters of quail on a bed of green beans, the great bowls of Carcassonne cherries on ice, the slabs of local cheese, and bottle after bottle of St John wine. The St John philosophy has been boiled down \u2013 reduced \u2013 to \u201cnose-to-tail\u201d as if it is simply an approach to using every last part of \u201cthe pivotal pig\u201d. It is more than that, though, as Henderson insists: \u201cIt is a way of being in the world.\u201d One thing the fete proves is that the way of being which St John celebrates is entirely exportable. The lunch eventually ends in the early evening with a hair-raising drive down the hillside; in the absence of the firemen\u2019s shindig the night continues at the Caf\u00e9 de la Poste. There are more traditions to enjoy; the next morning, Gulliver rattles me up the mountain tracks to the vineyard, while Henderson enjoys his morning madeira. Then the previous day\u2019s survivors head, as ever, to Carcassonne for soothing cassoulet. The weekend, I have realised by now, works on the same principle as the restaurant it celebrates: if it works, why ever change it? I\u2019m intrigued that after 25 years, Henderson and Gulliver still eat most days at St John. When I ask why, Gulliver replies, bluntly and in all honesty: \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Henderson, in the book, provides a fuller version of that sentiment, the best endorsement any chef could offer: \u201cStanding in the open kitchen it used to take every scrap of willpower that I could muster to prevent myself from jumping over the pass to join the throngs for lunch. There they were in front of me, swilling glasses of burgundy and chomping happily! I was consumed with quivering envy every day \u2013 it was almost more than I could bear.\u201d His illness provided him with the perfect excuse to join them whenever he wished. \u201cSo you see,\u201d he declares, \u201cit\u2019s not all bad!\u201d We can all drink to that. \u2018What better education could a chef have?\u2019 \u2013 St John alumni reflect on their time there Ravneet Gill, pastry chef and founder of Countertalk: St John 2015-2016 I was about to leave the restaurant industry when I applied for a baking job at St John. It was meant to be an interim position but I loved it so much that I ended up staying for a year and a half \u2013 it made me want to continue working as a chef. We used to joke that St John cares more about their staff than their customers. You\u2019re encouraged to be friends and socialise outside of work. They make great staff food \u2013 toad in the hole, mushrooms on toast, carrot and coriander soup, a full English breakfast every Monday \u2013 and after your shift you can have a drink at the bar, cost price. The ethos seems to have always been there \u2013 I think it filtered down from Fergus Henderson. He\u2019s always very approachable, always at the bar, open to talk to anybody. Since then I\u2019ve worked at a couple of restaurants started by St John alumni and they had the same ethos. Last year I set up an organisation called Countertalk, which is all about staff welfare and getting people in hospitality better treatment. It\u2019s definitely possible. St John is proof of that. James Lowe, chef-owner of Lyle\u2019s: St John Bread &amp; Wine 2006-2011 When I first ate there in 2003, the choices they were making weren\u2019t obvious. At the time everyone was obsessed with Gordon Ramsay and super-fancy food whereas Fergus\u2019s food was very bare-boned, based on flavour and simplicity. Nose-to-tail cookery is what St John has become synonymous with, but I\u2019d go further and say the food is very commonsense. That\u2019s the way we describe our food at Lyle\u2019s. We\u2019re very careful with what we throw away. There\u2019s a real focus on, is it true to its ingredients? Have we made sure it\u2019s not too fancy? These are all things carried over from St John. Within six months of starting at Bread &amp; Wine as sous chef, I ended up taking over the kitchen. I felt untested, but it was an opportunity to learn. I always thought of it as my own restaurant \u2013 and now at Lyle\u2019s, I really want the people I work with to feel like it\u2019s their restaurant too. I love Fergus\u2019s idea that people within a restaurant are what give it character. They hired people based on personalities rather than CVs, and I learned to see the value in that. It makes for a more interesting team, and hopefully better food. When I started cooking, I was told that kitchens were environments where bullying was rife and you had to work mad hours. It was easy for me not to go down that route: Fergus didn\u2019t have bullying in the kitchen; St John had a six-shift week. They just challenged all the norms. Lee Tiernan, chef-owner of Black Axe Mangal: St John Bread &amp; Wine 2003-2013 I was at catering college in south London in 2003 and needed to do a two-week stage in a restaurant to complete my qualification. I called St John to see if they\u2019d take me. I didn\u2019t think for one minute that they\u2019d offer me a full-time position, because I didn\u2019t know my arse from my elbow, but four days into my stint, one of the chefs handed in his notice and the head chef Ed Lewis said: \u201cDo you want a job?\u201d One of the first things I had to do was butcher a sirloin and a shoulder of beef. I was shaving and brining pig heads and roasting bone marrow, all sorts of stuff. I remember butchering a Middle White pig one day and throwing the skin away. Ed came over and said: \u201cWe don\u2019t throw anything away here really, nothing gets wasted.\u201d He showed me a box in the walk-in fridge full of skin and salt and said: \u201cIf we have a busy night and I need a starter, I\u2019ve got one here.\u201d As Fergus says, if you\u2019re going to kill an animal, it\u2019s only polite to eat the whole thing. What better education could a young chef have? I left in the autumn of 2013, by which time I was head chef at Bread &amp; Wine, but if I\u2019m honest I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really ever left. I still feel like part of the family. I call Trevor \u201cuncle\u201d, I call Fergus \u201cboss\u201d, and I\u2019ve gotten to know them on a more personal level. I\u2019d like to think that Trevor and Fergus are proud of how my wife Kate, who worked at St John for nine years, and I have carried ourselves since leaving. You don\u2019t want to let your parents down, you want them to be proud of you, and I want Trevor and Fergus to be proud of us as well. Interviews by Killian Fox",

      "body": "<p>It all began in 1966 in a scruffy shop in Greek Street, Soho. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/apr/19/thea-porter-kaftan-1970s-bohemian-chic-museum\" title=\"\">Thea Porter</a>, who was born in 1927 and spent her early life in Syria and Lebanon, started off selling furniture and textiles: \u201chuge embroidered Indian bedspreads, pieces of pearl-encrusted Ottoman furniture, wall hangings to cover the damp patches\u201d. She was swiftly adopted by \u201crich hippies, actors, musicians and their women\u201d who wanted her to make them clothes and went on to design for the Beatles, Mick Jagger and Diana Ross. She became queen of bohemian chic. In the last week of his life, Jimi Hendrix asked Porter to make him a black-and-white peacock-printed shirt. He showed up at her shop with \u201carmfuls of carnations, so many that we couldn\u2019t find vases for them\u201d. He picked up empty milk bottles and a Coke can from the street and arranged his flowers in them. That was Hendrix\u2019s homage to Porter. This captivating book is her daughter, Venetia\u2019s. The text is Thea Porter\u2019s own \u2013 written, after her business ended in 1986, at the prompting of her brother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/13/patrick-seale\" title=\"\">Patrick Seale</a>, a literary agent (and, for many years, the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s Middle East correspondent).</p> <p>In the Damascus of the 1930s, the young Porter made shifts out of walnut leaves (\u201cI can still recall the bitter smell\u2026 until they withered and fell off\u201d). Her father was a Jew turned Presbyterian missionary (more engaged with social and educational work than with the conversion of souls). Her mother was French and a midwife, with a taste for the exotic: \u201cDamascus soaps, brocade, silver-threaded silks, French bottles of scent and stockings.\u201d</p> <p>Porter\u2019s writing resembles her designs \u2013 it is often, as this list suggests, a sensual patchwork.

      "bodyText": "It all began in 1966 in a scruffy shop in Greek Street, Soho. Thea Porter, who was born in 1927 and spent her early life in Syria and Lebanon, started off selling furniture and textiles: \u201chuge embroidered Indian bedspreads, pieces of pearl-encrusted Ottoman furniture, wall hangings to cover the damp patches\u201d. She was swiftly adopted by \u201crich hippies, actors, musicians and their women\u201d who wanted her to make them clothes and went on to design for the Beatles, Mick Jagger and Diana Ross. She became queen of bohemian chic. In the last week of his life, Jimi Hendrix asked Porter to make him a black-and-white peacock-printed shirt. He showed up at her shop with \u201carmfuls of carnations, so many that we couldn\u2019t find vases for them\u201d. He picked up empty milk bottles and a Coke can from the street and arranged his flowers in them. That was Hendrix\u2019s homage to Porter. This captivating book is her daughter, Venetia\u2019s. The text is Thea Porter\u2019s own \u2013 written, after her business ended in 1986, at the prompting of her brother, Patrick Seale, a literary agent (and, for many years, the Observer\u2019s Middle East correspondent). In the Damascus of the 1930s, the young Porter made shifts out of walnut leaves (\u201cI can still recall the bitter smell\u2026 until they withered and fell off\u201d). Her father was a Jew turned Presbyterian missionary (more engaged with social and educational work than with the conversion of souls). Her mother was French and a midwife, with a taste for the exotic: \u201cDamascus soaps, brocade, silver-threaded silks, French bottles of scent and stockings.\u201d Porter\u2019s writing resembles her designs \u2013 it is often, as this list suggests, a sensual patchwork. She revels in everything from Syrian ice cream thickly topped with pistachio to gold bangles and precious stones. Like a wardrobe overflowing with wondrous clothes, the book is stuffed with photographs and paintings. She was a considerable artist too. Porter had stores in London, Paris and New York and worked tirelessly, policing every sequin.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a kingfisher!\u201d Ed\u2019s body swung round and leaned forward, his arm following in a wavelike motion the bird soaring above the water at Cannop Ponds in the Forest of Dean. We leaned with him, scanning the sky. \u201cThere it is, there it is.\u201d Ed Drewitt, our guide, had spotted its landing perch in a pine around 400 metres away. \u201cWow, I\u2019d love to be able to do that,\u201d my daughter whispered. Ed got his binoculars out so we could glimpse the orange belly of the bird, the first kingfisher he\u2019d seen this year, he told us excitedly. Ed, a passionate zoologist, was taking us on an \u201canimal safari\u201d, offered to guests staying at the <a href=\"https://tudorfarmhousehotel.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tudor Farmhouse</a> in the heart of the Forest of Dean. The \u201csafari\u201d is perfect for animal lovers, including my daughter Sophie, 20, studying animal management, and my 16-year-old son, Toby.</p> <p>We\u2019d arrived the afternoon before and, thanks to the hotel\u2019s map of wild swimming spots, headed straight out to the River Usk, half an hour away, sinking into the water from a tiny island beach in the centre of a bend in the river. After a slow journey on clogged motorways, it was a refreshing and magical way to start our forest adventure. Back at the hotel, we enjoyed cocktails in the garden, before stepping across a wooden bridge over a tiny stream that led inside to dinner. I was impressed by the variety on the menu, particularly for someone like me who is gluten and dairy-free, and by the fact that much of it was locally sourced \u2013 and tucked into delicately flavoured beetroot and cured salmon, followed by pork belly with roast onion.</p> <p>The next morning, it was a short drive to <a href=\"https://www.puzzlewood.net/\">Puzzlewood</a>, the inspiration for Tolkien\u2019s Middle-earth, an area of woodland where moss carpets a landscape of rocks and trees.

Stopping at the ponds, he was soon in raptures at the sight of wagtails, mandarin ducks, coots, goldfinches, chaffinches and, of course, that kingfisher.</p> <p>What we were itching to see were wild boars, the wild pigs which were once native here, before being hunted to extinction. But then, 10-15 years ago, they were reintroduced by an anonymous breeder who released a few into the woods. As prolific breeders with no natural predators, the boars quickly multiplied and today there are an impressive 1,500 of them. Deep into the forest Ed led us, encouraging us to inhale the hoplike scent of flowering horse chestnuts and the freshness of wild mint, as the words and rhythm of Michael Rosen\u2019s We\u2019re Going on a Bear Hunt played in my head. Suddenly we heard snuffling and grunting and the sound of twigs snapping under trotters. We stood still, peering into the trees, slightly scared by the prospect of the untamed beasts we could hear, but wanting to see them, too. Minutes passed. The sound died away. We marched on.</p> <p>The geography of the forest, sandwiched between the rivers Severn and Wye, meant that it was historically an isolated and closed community. Even today, \u201cForesters\u201d \u2013 people born in the Forest of Dean \u2013 have special privileges, such as the right to mine iron ore, coal and stone, and permission to allow their sheep to roam free. A couple of days later at the <a href=\"https://thespeechhouse.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Speech House</a>, a 17th-century hunting lodge and courthouse turned hotel, we were to learn about the ancient system of rule that still exists \u2013 and indulge in a three-tiered cream tea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aed8dcb6c78b209a8021838d1ee7e90b06e14656\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aed8dcb6c78b209a8021838d1ee7e90b06e14656/134_530_4619_2772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wild boarlets in the Forest of Dean\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Babes in the wood: wild boarlets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Mugridge/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was 9.30pm and the light was fading. We\u2019d stared through the binoculars at the grace of a stock-still deer and glimpsed another as it bolted into the trees. Ed picked up a dorbeetle to show us its iridescent belly and Toby held a tiny toad in his palm. Then, almost back at the ponds, we finally caught sight of a pair of cute stripy-backed boarlets who shuffled across the path in front of us. Then it was back to the hotel where a welcome platter of cold meats and cheeses awaited us.</p> <p>The following morning we had a break from animals to glide up and down the Wye on paddleboards \u2013 a first for me \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.inspire2adventure.com/\" title=\"\">Inspire2Adventure</a>. In our two-hour session, thanks to skillful instruction from the friendly Paul Marshall, we quickly got from kneeling to standing, learned several ways to turn and even mastered a few tricks, such as linking our boards to create a raft. Fully clothed, Sophie and I were determined to keep out of the water while Toby, experimenting with jumping 180 degrees on his board, fell in multiple times \u2013 and declared that we were boring for staying dry. Later, Sophie was keen to visit the butterfly zoo a few miles up the road, so she and I spent a couple of hours in its tropical enclosure spotting rare specimens, such as the owl and blue morpho, and even a delicate glasswing.</p> <p>As the day closed, we checked into a remote but extremely comfortable cottage with <a href=\"https://www.forestbarnholidays.co.uk/\">Forest Barn Holidays</a> outside Cinderford, on the forest\u2019s eastern edge. A hot tub on the patio and a welcome basket of local goodies meant we barely strayed from the site. We were, however, lured away to dinner by the <a href=\"http://thelyoninn.com/\" title=\"\">Lyon Inn</a> at Westbury-on-Severn where our fussy diets were once more impressively catered for, again by mostly local produce. I couldn\u2019t resist the sound of charred peach and maple-glazed tofu with puy lentils, while Sophie and Toby enjoyed nasturtium pesto on a light and fluffy bruschetta.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9c74f0911cefb174ebcebe4820573782df6804a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c74f0911cefb174ebcebe4820573782df6804a3/0_288_4240_2544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stone farmhouse, with manicured gardens in front and hillside behind\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Impressive menu: the Tudor Farmhouse</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was a final piece of forest magic on our last morning, at the onsite <a href=\"https://www.forestbarnholidays.co.uk/falconryexperience\">falconry</a>, a stone\u2019s throw from our cottage. My own childhood experience of birds of prey, gawping at them in cages or watching somebody else fly them, had never stirred my imagination. Here, however, we saw them up close \u2013 really close \u2013 just the three of us, and the resident falconer Mark Parker whose passion began, just as in <em>Kes</em>, with a tough school life and a pet kestrel. Each of us in turn slipped our hand in the glove so that Mark could place the bird \u2013 first a kestrel, then a Harris hawk, finally a barn owl \u2013 on it. The birds then flew to a post before gliding back towards us, wings full stretch in hypnotic motion, hovering momentarily in front of the gauntlet then touching down gracefully as we kept its landing perch steady. I held a goshawk, the lethal beak and fearsome stare of its yellow eyes inches from my face and witnessed my daughter do likewise, her absorbed, lit-up expression alongside is dazzling plumage. And I caught my son\u2019s reverence at the peregrine falcon on his arm. Its ability to dive at 200mph makes it the fastest creature on earth.</p> <p>The final treat was when Mark brought out the falconry\u2019s newest arrival, a baby snowy owl, which we were allowed to stroke. We all watched as the tiny fledgling with soft grey feathers hopped around in front of us \u2013 the perfect end to our nature adventure.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://tudorfarmhousehotel.co.uk/\">Tudor Farmhouse</a> has double rooms from \u00a399.

Then, almost back at the ponds, we finally caught sight of a pair of cute stripy-backed boarlets who shuffled across the path in front of us. Then it was back to the hotel where a welcome platter of cold meats and cheeses awaited us. The following morning we had a break from animals to glide up and down the Wye on paddleboards \u2013 a first for me \u2013 with Inspire2Adventure. In our two-hour session, thanks to skillful instruction from the friendly Paul Marshall, we quickly got from kneeling to standing, learned several ways to turn and even mastered a few tricks, such as linking our boards to create a raft. Fully clothed, Sophie and I were determined to keep out of the water while Toby, experimenting with jumping 180 degrees on his board, fell in multiple times \u2013 and declared that we were boring for staying dry. Later, Sophie was keen to visit the butterfly zoo a few miles up the road, so she and I spent a couple of hours in its tropical enclosure spotting rare specimens, such as the owl and blue morpho, and even a delicate glasswing. As the day closed, we checked into a remote but extremely comfortable cottage with Forest Barn Holidays outside Cinderford, on the forest\u2019s eastern edge. A hot tub on the patio and a welcome basket of local goodies meant we barely strayed from the site. We were, however, lured away to dinner by the Lyon Inn at Westbury-on-Severn where our fussy diets were once more impressively catered for, again by mostly local produce. I couldn\u2019t resist the sound of charred peach and maple-glazed tofu with puy lentils, while Sophie and Toby enjoyed nasturtium pesto on a light and fluffy bruschetta. There was a final piece of forest magic on our last morning, at the onsite falconry, a stone\u2019s throw from our cottage. My own childhood experience of birds of prey, gawping at them in cages or watching somebody else fly them, had never stirred my imagination. Here, however, we saw them up close \u2013 really close \u2013 just the three of us, and the resident falconer Mark Parker whose passion began, just as in Kes, with a tough school life and a pet kestrel. Each of us in turn slipped our hand in the glove so that Mark could place the bird \u2013 first a kestrel, then a Harris hawk, finally a barn owl \u2013 on it. The birds then flew to a post before gliding back towards us, wings full stretch in hypnotic motion, hovering momentarily in front of the gauntlet then touching down gracefully as we kept its landing perch steady. I held a goshawk, the lethal beak and fearsome stare of its yellow eyes inches from my face and witnessed my daughter do likewise, her absorbed, lit-up expression alongside is dazzling plumage. And I caught my son\u2019s reverence at the peregrine falcon on his arm. Its ability to dive at 200mph makes it the fastest creature on earth. The final treat was when Mark brought out the falconry\u2019s newest arrival, a baby snowy owl, which we were allowed to stroke. We all watched as the tiny fledgling with soft grey feathers hopped around in front of us \u2013 the perfect end to our nature adventure. \u2022 Tudor Farmhouse has double rooms from \u00a399.

We believe in a dour brine, to allow the essential nature to shine. You can have too much going on.</p> <p>One thing that should be made clear is that saltpetre in a brine is a mistake. It has an industrial feeling, you start itching as soon as the stuff comes into the kitchen, and since it works at speed it belies the very intention of a brine.</p> <p>Bring all the brine ingredients to the boil in a large stainless steel pot, making sure that the sugar and salt are thoroughly dissolved. Pour this into a container which will happily fit into your fridge, and allow to cool. When the liquid is cool, place the guinea fowl in it and leave overnight. Rinse before continuing with the recipe.</p> <p>It is noted in <em>Nose to Tail</em> that this recipe for aioli is not for purists, for whom our methods might seem crude. For them there are other aioli recipes, and we will not be hurt if they use those instead. But this is how we make our aioli: with eggs, and in a food processor rather than a pestle and mortar. It stands us in good stead.</p> <p>Still more brazen: aioli\u2019s role in life is to be unapologetically strong. Invariably when our new chefs make this aioli for the first time there is a timid query: \u201cSorry to ask, Chef, are you sure the recipe is right?\u201d It is indeed right. It may be a little terrifying in isolation, but it will make perfect sense alongside its companion.</p> <p>To make approximately 1 litre of aioli \u2013 an excellent thing to have in the fridge \u2013 put the garlic into a blender with a pinch of salt to get things going and blitz until fine. Add the yolks and blend again to incorporate with the garlic and, while the blender whizzes, slowly trickle in the olive oil until it is emulsified. At this point add half the lemon juice and a pinch of black pepper. Taste, and adjust with salt, more lemon juice and pepper, and a little water to let it back, if needed.</p> <p>To cook the guinea fowl, place the bird and all the stock ingredients in a pot, cover with the chicken stock and bring gently to the boil. As soon as it boils, cover it with a lid, remove from the heat and allow to cool.</p> <p>Strain the stock and return it to a clean pot, keeping back enough of the fortified broth to cook your summer vegetables. Immerse the guinea fowl and heat through gently but thoroughly, which should take around 30 minutes on a gentle heat. You may worry that this gentle method will not be sufficient to cook the bird through, but be brave. You will have a bird which is moist, without falling apart or toughening up.</p> <p>Bring the stock for the vegetables to the boil and drop in the grelots (a whole shallot will suffice, if grelots are not forthcoming). Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, then reduce to a simmer and add the carrots and turnips, cooking them until just tender. Now in with the radishes, broad beans and peas for the merest of moments, then stir in your turnip greens. Remove from the heat immediately, pull the bird from the broth and joint it roughly. Season the broth, being mindful that the bird was already brined, then spoon the broth and vegetables into bowls and top each with a piece of jointed guinea fowl and a dollop of aioli.</p> <p>If you have any broth left over, then you have the most beautiful stock to use as you please.</p> <h2>Ham, marrow and parsley sauce </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4421414587c7c9c4dfa0cf562ce09135902d61c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4421414587c7c9c4dfa0cf562ce09135902d61c/862_800_6036_4334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ham, marrow and parsley sauce.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There is no more comforting way of eating a hot ham, and no better way of eating a sadly overlooked vegetable. Marrows are serene. There they sit in the vegetable patch, not bothering anyone. A friendly nature, the marrow.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 8</strong></em><br><strong>cooked ham</strong> 1, with its stock (see below) <br><strong>English marrows</strong> 2, peeled, halved lengthways and with seeds removed (a teaspoon is the perfect marrow gutter)</p> <p><em><strong>For the parsley sauce</strong></em><br><strong>whole milk</strong> 800ml <br><strong>bay leaves </strong>3 <br><strong>onions</strong> 2, peeled and quartered, each quarter studded with a clove <br><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 80g <br><strong>plain white flour </strong>80g <br><strong>ham stock</strong><br><strong>sea salt and black pepper</strong><br><strong>dijon mustard</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>curly parsley</strong> 1 large bunch, picked and finely chopped</p> <p><em><strong>For the cooked ham</strong></em><em><strong> (to serve 8 \u2013 bear in mind that it is always good to cook enough to keep in the fridge for later)</strong></em><br><strong>ham leg</strong> 1, boned and rolled, or a 4kg piece of rolled collar <br><strong>celery</strong> 4 sticks <br><strong>onions</strong> 4, peeled and halved<br><strong>leeks</strong> 4, cleaned<br><strong>carrots</strong> 4, peeled<br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 whole head, split in half widthways <br><strong>a bundle of joy</strong> parsley stalks, thyme, rosemary and bay leaves tied together tightly<br><strong>black peppercorns</strong> 10 <br><strong>chicken stock</strong> 3\u20134 litres</p> <p>To cook the ham, place everything together in a large pan and, if the ham is not submerged by the stock, add water to cover. Bear in mind that, at a pinch, water alone would work, so do not be nervous if it does need a top-up. Bring gently to the boil, skim, then reduce to a simmer for 2\u00bd to 3 hours.</p> <p>Check with a knife or skewer; you are looking for a degree of give but you do not want your ham falling apart. Having said this, if you find that this is the case do not worry \u2013 there are many good uses for slightly-falling-apart ham. Strain and discard the vegetables, which will have given up their goodness, and reserve the stock.</p> <p>To make the parsley sauce, bring the milk, bay leaves and clove-studded onions to a gentle simmer in a heavy-bottomed pan, then remove from the heat and allow everything to infuse for an hour or so.</p> <p>Melt the butter, add the flour and stir over a gentle heat; you do not want it to colour but you are looking for the biscuity aroma which indicates that it is ready for the milk, which you should whisk into the mixture with confidence until it is firm and creamy. Then begin to add ladles of ham stock until a silky, velvety consistency has been reached \u2013 it should pool, but not run away. Test for seasoning and whisk in the dijon mustard, then stir the chopped parsley through the comforting sauce just before serving.</p> <p>Chop your marrow halves widthways into 5\u20137\u00bdcm chunks. Simmer them in the rest of the ham stock, bearing in mind marrow has a tendency to take on moisture and implode. When it is just shy of tender, lift from the stock and serve next to the ham: the residual heat will take the marrows to where they need to be, while still retaining their dignity.</p> <p>Be generous with your parsley sauce, serve it in jugs and allow your companions to express themselves with the pouring.</p> <p>Carrots, broad beans or peas, dropped into the cooking liquor at the appropriate time, are admirable substitutions for the gentle marrow.</p> <h2>Smoked cod\u2019s roe, egg and potato cake</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64384580c885d1f1b7280ba5b68ad744007ed90e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64384580c885d1f1b7280ba5b68ad744007ed90e/1029_831_5918_4667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smoked cod\u2019s roe,egg and potato cake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"789\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>To serve 6</strong></em><br><strong>eggs</strong> 6 large <br><strong>duck </strong><strong>fat </strong><strong>potato cake</strong> 18 fingers, well-seasoned, still hot (see below) <br><strong>mustard cress</strong> a good handful</p> <p><em><strong>For the duck fat potatoes</strong></em><br><strong>maris </strong><strong>piper potatoes</strong> 6 large, peeled and sliced wafer thin (use a mandoline)<br><strong>sea salt</strong><br><strong>duck fat </strong>200g</p> <p><strong>vegetable oil or more duck fat</strong> for deep frying</p> <p><em><strong>For the roe</strong></em><br><strong>milk</strong> 600ml <br><strong>lemon</strong> juice of 1 <br><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves, grated<br><strong>white bread </strong>200g, without crusts,<br>cut into cubes<br><strong>smoked cod\u2019s roe</strong> 700g <br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 600ml <br><strong>vegetable oil </strong>500ml</p> <p>To make the duck fat potato cake, rinse the sliced potatoes in a colander to wash off any excess starch, allow them to drip dry for 30 minutes, shaking every so often to help them along, then place them in a large mixing bowl and season with salt. Gently melt the duck fat until warm and liquid and pour over the potatoes, gently mixing with your hands to ensure that they are coated evenly but being careful not to damage the slices.</p> <p>In a roasting tray at least 2\u00bdcm deep and lined with greaseproof paper, start layering the potatoes evenly and methodically, building up layer by layer. Depth is important in this step. Cover your finished strata with tin foil and bake in a medium oven (180C/gas mark 4) for 2 hours, or until a knife easily goes through the cooked potato. Remove the foil and bake for a further 10 minutes, then take out of the oven and allow to cool. Find a tray of a similar surface area which will fit on top of the potato dish. Add some weight from tins or bottles and allow to press in the fridge overnight. The next day, turn it out and cut into fingers roughly 2\u00bdcm high, 6\u00bdcm wide and 5mm deep. Deep fry until golden brown.</p> <p>Prepare the roe. Combine the milk, lemon juice and garlic in a large bowl, then add the bread and leave to soak until it has taken up all the liquid. When ready, pour it into the bowl of a blender along with the smoked cod\u2019s roe and blend until smooth. Slowly add the oil little by little as you blend to emulsify.</p> <p>Boil the eggs according to your preferred soft-boiling method: we favour plunging them into boiling water and cooking for 6 minutes, then removing from the heat and plunging immediately into iced water. Peel the eggs when they are cool, treating them tenderly so as not to break the soft yolks.</p> <p>Dollop the cod\u2019s roe on to the platter, scatter the potato cake fingers around, and place the boiled eggs carefully among them, cutting them in half to allow the yolk to run. Nestle clusters of mustard cress next to the eggs.</p> <h2>Tomato, little gem and anchovy \u2013 \u2018the salad which saved my life\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce2bb6603a837ff80f825b9edf0b06930dbf00c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce2bb6603a837ff80f825b9edf0b06930dbf00c6/1602_0_4726_5991/789.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The salad which saved my life\u2019.\" width=\"789\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The salad which saved my life\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Lowe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here the juices of the soft, sweet tomatoes mix with the vinaigrette to create a wonderful, rich tomato dressing.</p> <p>Some 20 years ago I went to visit my sister in Barcelona and we had to have five lunches in one day. At that time much of the city shut over the weekend so we had to take in every restaurant she wanted to show me on the Friday of my arrival. The pace continued, fuelled by the icy cold, rough version of marc they serve in those parts. So on Saturday morning I truly thought I was dying. We went to a very ancient restaurant, whose name escapes me but which laid some claim to being the oldest or thereabouts, and I ordered this salad. I lived! Here I am to prove it! I am alive thanks to this salad.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4</strong></em><br><strong>tomatoes</strong> 6 <br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong><br><strong>sea salt and black pepper</strong><br><strong>curly parsley </strong>a handful, finely chopped <br><strong>good anchovy fillets in oil</strong> 16, separated but kept whole \u2013 we like Ortiz<br><strong>little gem lettuce</strong> 2 heads, washed and dismantled but with the leaves left whole<br><strong>vinaigrette</strong> a splash (see below)</p> <p><em><strong>For the vinaigrette</strong></em><em><strong> (makes approximately 800ml</strong></em><em><strong>)</strong></em><br><strong>dijon mustard</strong> 125g <br><strong>white wine vinegar</strong> 125ml <br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 525ml <br><strong>lemon</strong> juice of \u00bd<br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 large clove, finely minced <br><strong>sea salt and black pepper</strong></p> <p>To make the vinaigrette, mix the mustard and vinegar together and, once they are combined, begin to whisk as you slowly trickle in the extra virgin olive oil. The mixture should emulsify. Finally, add the lemon juice, minced garlic and seasoning.</p> <p>Slice the tomatoes in half, dress with the olive oil, and salt and pepper and roast them in a medium oven (180C/gas mark 4) for 20 minutes. They will soften slightly and dry a little, intensifying and sweetening their flavour. Allow them to cool, then mix all the ingredients in a bowl and eat immediately.</p> <p><em>The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s Good Fish Guide</em></p> <h2>Salted chocolate and caramel tart</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0033dd5c53c977b9307104f8cea4ecf94429c495\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0033dd5c53c977b9307104f8cea4ecf94429c495/690_868_6496_4450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salted chocolate and caramel tart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is a very rich tart, you will not need very much.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves at least 16</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>For the </strong></em><em><strong>tart case</strong></em></p> <p><strong>plain flour</strong> 200g</p> <p><strong>cocoa powder </strong>45g</p> <p><strong>bicarbonate of soda</strong> 7g</p> <p><strong>demerara sugar</strong> 180g</p> <p><strong>caster sugar</strong> 25g</p> <p><strong>Maldon sea salt</strong> 5g</p> <p><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 225g, softened</p> <p><strong>dark chocolate</strong> 225g, chopped finely \u2013 the pieces should be smaller than a chocolate chip</p> <p><em><strong>For the caramel</strong></em></p> <p><strong>caster sugar</strong> 225g</p> <p><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 70g, cut into chunks</p> <p><strong>double cream</strong> 80ml</p> <p><em><strong>For the chocolate filling</strong></em></p> <p><strong>double cream</strong> 500g</p> <p><strong>glucose</strong> 40g</p> <p><strong>dark chocolate</strong> 400g, broken into pieces</p> <p><strong>butter</strong> 40g</p> <p><strong>sea salt</strong> for sprinkling</p> <p>First make the tart case. It is easiest by far to use a machine for this. Mix together the flour, cocoa powder, bicarb of soda, both sugars and the salt, place in a food processor with the butter, and whizz until a loose dough forms. At this point add the chocolate and mix again. Wrap in clingfilm and rest in the fridge for half an hour or so.</p> <p>If you are making the pastry any further in advance, take it out of the fridge in good time \u2013 you need the softness of room-temperature dough for it to work. When ready, butter and flour a tart case and roll the pastry between two sheets of baking parchment \u2013 the shards of chocolate would tear clingfilm, but the dough is too sticky to be rolled loose. Line the case with the pastry, rolled to around 4mm thick, line the pastry with foil or ovenproof clingfilm, fill with baking beans and bake in a medium oven (180C/gas mark 4) for 25 to 30 minutes.</p> <p>When you remove the case from the oven, wait 10 minutes before removing the beans, otherwise the hot, soft pastry may tear. Once you have done so, press the base and sides all over with the back of a spoon while it is still warm \u2013 the aim here is to smooth it ready for the caramel, pushing down the inside corners which may have risen and rounded a little in the baking.</p> <p>Once the case is cool, make your caramel. It is essential to move quickly when the caramel is ready, so ensure that all your ducks are in a row before you start. Place the sugar in a scrupulously dry pan and melt over a medium high heat. Do not stir! Stirring will result in a crystallised disaster. Swirling the pan a little is allowed. By the time the sugar has dissolved you should have a good colour, trusting that it can be quite dark and still be comfortable. Throw the butter in first and follow with the cream, whisk them together quickly and, at the very moment that they are smoothly incorporated, pour it into the case immediately. With speed, pick up your tart case and move it around, tilting it to ensure that the caramel covers the entire base. Leave aside to cool.</p> <p>Finally, for the chocolate filling, heat the cream with the glucose and take it just shy of a simmer. Place the chocolate and butter in a bowl and pour the hot cream over the chunks in three stages, stirring gently to incorporate \u2013 the first will melt the chocolate, the second will loosen the mixture and the third will make the smooth ganache. Then pour the mixture into the tart and leave to cool and solidify. Sprinkle with a little sea salt and serve with creme fraiche.</p> <h2>Fig and almond tart</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fde8d7a3d8f7c2dcab47142ae378a1daa19f5181\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fde8d7a3d8f7c2dcab47142ae378a1daa19f5181/375_840_7669_4602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fig and almond tart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The sweet pastry case can be used for bakewell tarts, custard tarts and any number of tart possibilities. This recipe is enough to line 2 x 25cm tart cases \u2013 it is handy to have a lined case or two in the freezer for inevitable moments of immediate tart need.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 12</strong></em></p> <p><strong>figs</strong> a couple of handfuls, cut in half</p> <p><strong>flaked almonds</strong> a handful </p> <p><em><strong>For the pastry (enough for 2 tarts) </strong></em><br><strong>plain flour</strong> 500g <br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 180g <br><strong>ground almonds</strong> 60g <br><strong>lemon</strong> zest of \u00bd<br><strong>cold butter</strong> 300g<br><strong>egg yolks</strong> 6</p> <p><em><strong>For the frangipane (enough for 2 tarts)</strong></em><br><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 225g, softened<br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 225g <br><strong>eggs</strong> 4<br><strong>plain flour</strong> 2 level tbsp <br><strong>ground almonds</strong> 150g <br><strong>amaretto</strong> 1 tbsp<br><strong>nibbed almonds</strong> 75g</p> <p>First make the tart cases. Mix the dry ingredients and lemon zest together in a bowl, then add the butter, cut into small chunks, and rub between your fingers to form breadcrumbs. This can be done very satisfactorily and with less bother in a mixer with the paddle attachment. Pour in the egg yolks and mix again until a dough forms, then wrap in clingfilm and rest in the fridge for half an hour.</p> <p>Lightly butter and flour your tart cases. Roll out each pastry ball on a floured surface to 4mm thick and line the tart cases, pushing the pastry down carefully to fill each crevice, then place in the freezer for 3 hours to bake from frozen. Line the cases with foil or oven-safe clingfilm, fill with baking beans and bake for 25 minutes in a medium oven. When the edges are pale golden, remove the baking beans \u2013 you may find that the bottom still looks a little raw; if so, pop it back into the oven for 5 minutes without the baking beans, just to wipe the sweat from its brow.</p> <p>Now for the frangipane, as the tart cases cool. Cream the butter and sugar together until pale, light and fluffy, then take 2 of the eggs and add them one at a time, beating well after adding each one. At this point add the flour, beating again, and then the remaining 2 eggs. When the mixture is loose and smooth, add the amaretto and the almonds.</p> <p>Set aside half the frangipane if you are not using it \u2013 it also freezes excellently. Pipe or spoon the remaining half into the cool pastry, smooth, then lay on the figs, cut side up, in your desired configuration. There is no need to press them in as the frangipane will rise around them.

      "bodyText": "Guinea fowl Serves 4 guinea fowl 1 whole, brined overnight and rinsed chicken stock 2-3 litres For the brine sugar 400g sea salt 600g juniper berries 12 cloves 12 black peppercorns 12 bay leaves 3 water 4 litres For the stock carrots 2, peeled leeks 2, cleaned onions 2, peeled and halved garlic 1 head celery 2 sticks a bundle of joy parsley stalks, thyme, rosemary and bay leaves tied together tightly black peppercorns 10 For the summer veg grelot onions 1 bunch, washed, trimmed and left whole small carrots 1 bunch, vigorously scrubbed and with greens trimmed to leave 1cm baby turnips 1 bunch, greens separated, washed and retained English breakfast radishes 1 bunch, with happy leaves, washed thoroughly fresh broad beans a handful fresh peas a handful sea salt and black pepper aioli (see below) For the aioli garlic 40 cloves sea salt and black pepper egg yolks 5 olive oil 700ml lemon juice of 1 water as necessary Some people use muscovado sugar to make a brine, but we find that too rich. We believe in a dour brine, to allow the essential nature to shine. You can have too much going on. One thing that should be made clear is that saltpetre in a brine is a mistake. It has an industrial feeling, you start itching as soon as the stuff comes into the kitchen, and since it works at speed it belies the very intention of a brine. Bring all the brine ingredients to the boil in a large stainless steel pot, making sure that the sugar and salt are thoroughly dissolved. Pour this into a container which will happily fit into your fridge, and allow to cool. When the liquid is cool, place the guinea fowl in it and leave overnight. Rinse before continuing with the recipe. It is noted in Nose to Tail that this recipe for aioli is not for purists, for whom our methods might seem crude. For them there are other aioli recipes, and we will not be hurt if they use those instead. But this is how we make our aioli: with eggs, and in a food processor rather than a pestle and mortar. It stands us in good stead. Still more brazen: aioli\u2019s role in life is to be unapologetically strong. Invariably when our new chefs make this aioli for the first time there is a timid query: \u201cSorry to ask, Chef, are you sure the recipe is right?\u201d It is indeed right. It may be a little terrifying in isolation, but it will make perfect sense alongside its companion. To make approximately 1 litre of aioli \u2013 an excellent thing to have in the fridge \u2013 put the garlic into a blender with a pinch of salt to get things going and blitz until fine. Add the yolks and blend again to incorporate with the garlic and, while the blender whizzes, slowly trickle in the olive oil until it is emulsified. At this point add half the lemon juice and a pinch of black pepper. Taste, and adjust with salt, more lemon juice and pepper, and a little water to let it back, if needed. To cook the guinea fowl, place the bird and all the stock ingredients in a pot, cover with the chicken stock and bring gently to the boil. As soon as it boils, cover it with a lid, remove from the heat and allow to cool. Strain the stock and return it to a clean pot, keeping back enough of the fortified broth to cook your summer vegetables. Immerse the guinea fowl and heat through gently but thoroughly, which should take around 30 minutes on a gentle heat. You may worry that this gentle method will not be sufficient to cook the bird through, but be brave. You will have a bird which is moist, without falling apart or toughening up. Bring the stock for the vegetables to the boil and drop in the grelots (a whole shallot will suffice, if grelots are not forthcoming). Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, then reduce to a simmer and add the carrots and turnips, cooking them until just tender. Now in with the radishes, broad beans and peas for the merest of moments, then stir in your turnip greens. Remove from the heat immediately, pull the bird from the broth and joint it roughly. Season the broth, being mindful that the bird was already brined, then spoon the broth and vegetables into bowls and top each with a piece of jointed guinea fowl and a dollop of aioli. If you have any broth left over, then you have the most beautiful stock to use as you please. Ham, marrow and parsley sauce There is no more comforting way of eating a hot ham, and no better way of eating a sadly overlooked vegetable. Marrows are serene. There they sit in the vegetable patch, not bothering anyone. A friendly nature, the marrow. Serves 8 cooked ham 1, with its stock (see below) English marrows 2, peeled, halved lengthways and with seeds removed (a teaspoon is the perfect marrow gutter) For the parsley sauce whole milk 800ml bay leaves 3 onions 2, peeled and quartered, each quarter studded with a clove unsalted butter 80g plain white flour 80g ham stock sea salt and black pepper dijon mustard 1 tbsp curly parsley 1 large bunch, picked and finely chopped For the cooked ham (to serve 8 \u2013 bear in mind that it is always good to cook enough to keep in the fridge for later) ham leg 1, boned and rolled, or a 4kg piece of rolled collar celery 4 sticks onions 4, peeled and halved leeks 4, cleaned carrots 4, peeled garlic 1 whole head, split in half widthways a bundle of joy parsley stalks, thyme, rosemary and bay leaves tied together tightly black peppercorns 10 chicken stock 3\u20134 litres To cook the ham, place everything together in a large pan and, if the ham is not submerged by the stock, add water to cover. Bear in mind that, at a pinch, water alone would work, so do not be nervous if it does need a top-up. Bring gently to the boil, skim, then reduce to a simmer for 2\u00bd to 3 hours. Check with a knife or skewer; you are looking for a degree of give but you do not want your ham falling apart. Having said this, if you find that this is the case do not worry \u2013 there are many good uses for slightly-falling-apart ham. Strain and discard the vegetables, which will have given up their goodness, and reserve the stock. To make the parsley sauce, bring the milk, bay leaves and clove-studded onions to a gentle simmer in a heavy-bottomed pan, then remove from the heat and allow everything to infuse for an hour or so. Melt the butter, add the flour and stir over a gentle heat; you do not want it to colour but you are looking for the biscuity aroma which indicates that it is ready for the milk, which you should whisk into the mixture with confidence until it is firm and creamy. Then begin to add ladles of ham stock until a silky, velvety consistency has been reached \u2013 it should pool, but not run away. Test for seasoning and whisk in the dijon mustard, then stir the chopped parsley through the comforting sauce just before serving. Chop your marrow halves widthways into 5\u20137\u00bdcm chunks. Simmer them in the rest of the ham stock, bearing in mind marrow has a tendency to take on moisture and implode. When it is just shy of tender, lift from the stock and serve next to the ham: the residual heat will take the marrows to where they need to be, while still retaining their dignity. Be generous with your parsley sauce, serve it in jugs and allow your companions to express themselves with the pouring. Carrots, broad beans or peas, dropped into the cooking liquor at the appropriate time, are admirable substitutions for the gentle marrow. Smoked cod\u2019s roe, egg and potato cake To serve 6 eggs 6 large duck fat potato cake 18 fingers, well-seasoned, still hot (see below) mustard cress a good handful For the duck fat potatoes maris piper potatoes 6 large, peeled and sliced wafer thin (use a mandoline) sea salt duck fat 200g vegetable oil or more duck fat for deep frying For the roe milk 600ml lemon juice of 1 garlic 2 cloves, grated white bread 200g, without crusts, cut into cubes smoked cod\u2019s roe 700g extra virgin olive oil 600ml vegetable oil 500ml To make the duck fat potato cake, rinse the sliced potatoes in a colander to wash off any excess starch, allow them to drip dry for 30 minutes, shaking every so often to help them along, then place them in a large mixing bowl and season with salt. Gently melt the duck fat until warm and liquid and pour over the potatoes, gently mixing with your hands to ensure that they are coated evenly but being careful not to damage the slices. In a roasting tray at least 2\u00bdcm deep and lined with greaseproof paper, start layering the potatoes evenly and methodically, building up layer by layer. Depth is important in this step. Cover your finished strata with tin foil and bake in a medium oven (180C/gas mark 4) for 2 hours, or until a knife easily goes through the cooked potato. Remove the foil and bake for a further 10 minutes, then take out of the oven and allow to cool. Find a tray of a similar surface area which will fit on top of the potato dish. Add some weight from tins or bottles and allow to press in the fridge overnight. The next day, turn it out and cut into fingers roughly 2\u00bdcm high, 6\u00bdcm wide and 5mm deep. Deep fry until golden brown. Prepare the roe. Combine the milk, lemon juice and garlic in a large bowl, then add the bread and leave to soak until it has taken up all the liquid. When ready, pour it into the bowl of a blender along with the smoked cod\u2019s roe and blend until smooth. Slowly add the oil little by little as you blend to emulsify. Boil the eggs according to your preferred soft-boiling method: we favour plunging them into boiling water and cooking for 6 minutes, then removing from the heat and plunging immediately into iced water. Peel the eggs when they are cool, treating them tenderly so as not to break the soft yolks. Dollop the cod\u2019s roe on to the platter, scatter the potato cake fingers around, and place the boiled eggs carefully among them, cutting them in half to allow the yolk to run. Nestle clusters of mustard cress next to the eggs. Tomato, little gem and anchovy \u2013 \u2018the salad which saved my life\u2019 Here the juices of the soft, sweet tomatoes mix with the vinaigrette to create a wonderful, rich tomato dressing. Some 20 years ago I went to visit my sister in Barcelona and we had to have five lunches in one day. At that time much of the city shut over the weekend so we had to take in every restaurant she wanted to show me on the Friday of my arrival. The pace continued, fuelled by the icy cold, rough version of marc they serve in those parts. So on Saturday morning I truly thought I was dying. We went to a very ancient restaurant, whose name escapes me but which laid some claim to being the oldest or thereabouts, and I ordered this salad. I lived! Here I am to prove it! I am alive thanks to this salad. Serves 4 tomatoes 6 extra virgin olive oil sea salt and black pepper curly parsley a handful, finely chopped good anchovy fillets in oil 16, separated but kept whole \u2013 we like Ortiz little gem lettuce 2 heads, washed and dismantled but with the leaves left whole vinaigrette a splash (see below) For the vinaigrette (makes approximately 800ml) dijon mustard 125g white wine vinegar 125ml extra virgin olive oil 525ml lemon juice of \u00bd garlic 1 large clove, finely minced sea salt and black pepper To make the vinaigrette, mix the mustard and vinegar together and, once they are combined, begin to whisk as you slowly trickle in the extra virgin olive oil. The mixture should emulsify. Finally, add the lemon juice, minced garlic and seasoning. Slice the tomatoes in half, dress with the olive oil, and salt and pepper and roast them in a medium oven (180C/gas mark 4) for 20 minutes. They will soften slightly and dry a little, intensifying and sweetening their flavour. Allow them to cool, then mix all the ingredients in a bowl and eat immediately. The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s Good Fish Guide Salted chocolate and caramel tart This is a very rich tart, you will not need very much. Serves at least 16 For the tart case plain flour 200g cocoa powder 45g bicarbonate of soda 7g demerara sugar 180g caster sugar 25g Maldon sea salt 5g unsalted butter 225g, softened dark chocolate 225g, chopped finely \u2013 the pieces should be smaller than a chocolate chip For the caramel caster sugar 225g unsalted butter 70g, cut into chunks double cream 80ml For the chocolate filling double cream 500g glucose 40g dark chocolate 400g, broken into pieces butter 40g sea salt for sprinkling First make the tart case. It is easiest by far to use a machine for this. Mix together the flour, cocoa powder, bicarb of soda, both sugars and the salt, place in a food processor with the butter, and whizz until a loose dough forms. At this point add the chocolate and mix again. Wrap in clingfilm and rest in the fridge for half an hour or so. If you are making the pastry any further in advance, take it out of the fridge in good time \u2013 you need the softness of room-temperature dough for it to work. When ready, butter and flour a tart case and roll the pastry between two sheets of baking parchment \u2013 the shards of chocolate would tear clingfilm, but the dough is too sticky to be rolled loose. Line the case with the pastry, rolled to around 4mm thick, line the pastry with foil or ovenproof clingfilm, fill with baking beans and bake in a medium oven (180C/gas mark 4) for 25 to 30 minutes. When you remove the case from the oven, wait 10 minutes before removing the beans, otherwise the hot, soft pastry may tear. Once you have done so, press the base and sides all over with the back of a spoon while it is still warm \u2013 the aim here is to smooth it ready for the caramel, pushing down the inside corners which may have risen and rounded a little in the baking. Once the case is cool, make your caramel. It is essential to move quickly when the caramel is ready, so ensure that all your ducks are in a row before you start. Place the sugar in a scrupulously dry pan and melt over a medium high heat. Do not stir! Stirring will result in a crystallised disaster. Swirling the pan a little is allowed. By the time the sugar has dissolved you should have a good colour, trusting that it can be quite dark and still be comfortable. Throw the butter in first and follow with the cream, whisk them together quickly and, at the very moment that they are smoothly incorporated, pour it into the case immediately. With speed, pick up your tart case and move it around, tilting it to ensure that the caramel covers the entire base. Leave aside to cool. Finally, for the chocolate filling, heat the cream with the glucose and take it just shy of a simmer. Place the chocolate and butter in a bowl and pour the hot cream over the chunks in three stages, stirring gently to incorporate \u2013 the first will melt the chocolate, the second will loosen the mixture and the third will make the smooth ganache. Then pour the mixture into the tart and leave to cool and solidify. Sprinkle with a little sea salt and serve with creme fraiche. Fig and almond tart The sweet pastry case can be used for bakewell tarts, custard tarts and any number of tart possibilities. This recipe is enough to line 2 x 25cm tart cases \u2013 it is handy to have a lined case or two in the freezer for inevitable moments of immediate tart need. Serves 12 figs a couple of handfuls, cut in half flaked almonds a handful For the pastry (enough for 2 tarts) plain flour 500g caster sugar 180g ground almonds 60g lemon zest of \u00bd cold butter 300g egg yolks 6 For the frangipane (enough for 2 tarts) unsalted butter 225g, softened caster sugar 225g eggs 4 plain flour 2 level tbsp ground almonds 150g amaretto 1 tbsp nibbed almonds 75g First make the tart cases. Mix the dry ingredients and lemon zest together in a bowl, then add the butter, cut into small chunks, and rub between your fingers to form breadcrumbs. This can be done very satisfactorily and with less bother in a mixer with the paddle attachment. Pour in the egg yolks and mix again until a dough forms, then wrap in clingfilm and rest in the fridge for half an hour. Lightly butter and flour your tart cases. Roll out each pastry ball on a floured surface to 4mm thick and line the tart cases, pushing the pastry down carefully to fill each crevice, then place in the freezer for 3 hours to bake from frozen. Line the cases with foil or oven-safe clingfilm, fill with baking beans and bake for 25 minutes in a medium oven. When the edges are pale golden, remove the baking beans \u2013 you may find that the bottom still looks a little raw; if so, pop it back into the oven for 5 minutes without the baking beans, just to wipe the sweat from its brow. Now for the frangipane, as the tart cases cool. Cream the butter and sugar together until pale, light and fluffy, then take 2 of the eggs and add them one at a time, beating well after adding each one. At this point add the flour, beating again, and then the remaining 2 eggs. When the mixture is loose and smooth, add the amaretto and the almonds. Set aside half the frangipane if you are not using it \u2013 it also freezes excellently. Pipe or spoon the remaining half into the cool pastry, smooth, then lay on the figs, cut side up, in your desired configuration. There is no need to press them in as the frangipane will rise around them. Bake the tart for 30 minutes then carefully remove from the oven, scatter the flaked almonds on the wobbling surface, and bake for a further 15 minutes until a skewer comes out clean. Serve hot or cold, with creme fraiche or cream. This is a tart for any season, being an equally accommodating host for apricots, pears, plums, berries, or whatever fruit you have to hand.

      "body": "<p>Many moons ago in Tibet, the Second Buddha transformed a fierce <em>nyen</em> (a malevolent mountain demon) into a <em>neri</em> (the holiest protective warrior god) called Khawa Karpo, who took up residence in the sacred mountain bearing his name. Khawa Karpo is the tallest of the Meili mountain range, piercing the sky at 6,740 metres (22,112ft) above sea level. Local Tibetan communities believe that conquering Khawa Karpo is an act of sacrilege and would cause the deity to abandon his mountain home. Nevertheless, there have been several failed attempts by outsiders \u2013 the best known by an international team of 17, all of whom died in an avalanche during their ascent on 3 January 1991. After much local petitioning, in 2001 Beijing passed a law banning mountaineering there.</p> <p>However, Khawa Karpo continues to be affronted more insidiously. Over the past two decades, the Mingyong glacier at the foot of the mountain has dramatically receded. Villagers blame disrespectful human behaviour, including an inadequacy of prayer, greater material greed and an increase in pollution from tourism. People have started to avoid eating garlic and onions, burning meat, breaking vows or fighting for fear of <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcc.354\" title=\"\">unleashing the wrath of the deity</a>. Mingyong is one of the world\u2019s fastest shrinking glaciers, but locals cannot believe it will die because their own existence is intertwined with it. Yet its disappearance is almost inevitable.</p> <p>Khawa Karpo lies at the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/about/\" title=\"\">\u201cthird pole\u201d</a>. This is how glaciologists refer to the Tibetan plateau, home to the vast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/04/a-third-of-himalayan-ice-cap-doomed-finds-shocking-report\" title=\"\">Hindu Kush-Himalaya ice sheet</a>, because it contains the largest amount of snow and ice after the Arctic and Antarctic \u2013 the Chinese glaciers alone account for an <a href=\"http://english.cas.cn/newsroom/china_research/201504/t20150423_146594.shtml\">estimated 14.5%</a> of the global total.

This month, in a long-awaited <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/srocc/\" title=\"\">special report on the cryosphere</a> by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists will warn that up to two-thirds of the region\u2019s remaining glaciers are on track to disappear by the end of the century. It is expected a third of the ice will be lost in that time even if the internationally agreed target of limiting global warming by 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is adhered to.</p> <p>Whether we are Buddhists or not, our lives affect, and are affected by, these tropical glaciers that span eight countries. This frozen \u201cwater tower of Asia\u201d is the source of 10 of the world\u2019s largest rivers, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yellow, Mekong and Indus, whose flows support at least 1.6 billion people directly \u2013 in drinking water, agriculture, hydropower and livelihoods \u2013 and many more indirectly, in buying a T-shirt made from cotton grown in China, for example, or rice from India.</p> <p>Joseph Shea, a glaciologist at the University of Northern British Columbia, calls the loss \u201cdepressing and fear-inducing. It changes the nature of the mountains in a very visible and profound way.\u201d </p> <p>Yet the fast-changing conditions at the third pole have not received the same attention as those at the north and south poles. The IPCC\u2019s fourth assessment report in 2007 contained the erroneous prediction that all Himalayan glaciers would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/20/ipcc-himalayan-glaciers-mistake\" title=\"\">gone by 2035</a>. This statement turned out to have been based on anecdote rather than scientific evidence and, perhaps out of embarrassment, the third pole has been given less attention in subsequent IPCC reports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-zip/giv-3902DZpaSrGSe0ps/\" data-alt=\"Location of the Mingyong glacier\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-zip/giv-3902DZpaSrGSe0ps/\">Location of the Mingyong glacier</a> </figure>  <p>There is also a dearth of research compared to the other poles, and what hydrological data exists has been jealously guarded by the Indian government and other interested parties. The Tibetan plateau is a vast and impractical place for glaciologists to work in and confounding factors make measurements hard to obtain. Scientists are forbidden by locals, for instance, to step out on to the Mingyong glacier, meaning they have had to use repeat photography to measure the ice retreat.</p> <p>In the face of these problems, satellites have proved invaluable, allowing scientists to watch glacial shrinkage in real time. This summer, Columbia University researchers also used declassified spy-satellite images from the cold war to show that third pole ice loss has accelerated over this century and is now roughly double the melt rate of 1975 to 2000, when temperatures were on average 1C lower. Glaciers in the region are currently losing about half a vertical metre of ice per year because of anthropogenic global heating, <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/6/eaav7266\" title=\"\">the researchers concluded</a>. Glacial melt here carries significant risk of death and injury \u2013 far more than in the sparsely populated Arctic and Antarctic \u2013 from glacial lake outbursts (when a lake forms and suddenly spills over its banks in a devastating flood) and landslides caused by destabilised rock. Whole villages have been washed away and these events are becoming increasingly regular, even if monitoring and rescue systems have improved. Satellite data shows that numbers and sizes of such risky lakes in the region are growing.

Winter snowfall is already decreasing and there are, on average, four fewer cold nights and seven more warm nights per year than 40 years ago. Models also indicate a strengthening of the south-east monsoon, with heavy and unpredictable downpours. \u201cThis is the climate crisis you haven\u2019t heard of,\u201d said ICIMOD\u2019s chief scientist, Philippus Wester.</p> <p>There is another culprit besides our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in this warming story, and it\u2019s all too evident on the dirty surface of the Mingyong glacier: black carbon, or soot. <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgrd.50171\" title=\"\">A 2013 study</a> found that black carbon is responsible for 1.1 watts per square metre of the Earth\u2019s surface of extra energy being stored in the atmosphere (CO<sub>2</sub> is responsible for an estimated 1.56 watts per square metre). Black carbon has multiple climate effects, changing clouds and monsoon circulation as well as accelerating ice melt. Air pollution from the Indo-Gangetic Plains \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most polluted regions \u2013 deposits this black dust on glaciers, darkening their surface and hastening melt. While soot landing on dark rock has little effect on its temperature, snow and glaciers are particularly vulnerable because they are so white and reflective. As glaciers melt, the surrounding rock crumbles in landslides, covering the ice with dark material that speeds melt in a runaway cycle. The Everest base camp, for instance, at 5,300 metres, is now rubble and debris as the <a href=\"https://glacierchange.wordpress.com/2009/12/09/khumbu-glacier-decay/\" title=\"\">Khumbu glacier</a> has retreated to the icefall.</p> <p>The immense upland of the third pole is one of the most ecologically diverse and vulnerable regions on Earth.

Well, in many areas, it has been welcomed. Warmer, more pleasant winters have made life easier. The higher temperatures have boosted agriculture \u2013 people can grow a greater variety of crops and benefit from more than one harvest per year, and that improves livelihoods. This may be responsible for the so-called <a href=\"https://geographical.co.uk/places/mountains/item/2413-glacial-growth-cracking-the-karakoram-anomaly\" title=\"\">Karakoram anomaly</a>, in which a few glaciers in the Pakistani Karakoram range are advancing in opposition to the general trend. Climatologists believe that the sudden and massive growth of irrigated agriculture in the local area, coupled with unusual topographical features, has produced an increase in snowfall on the glaciers which currently <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GL076158\" title=\"\">more than compensates for their melting</a>.</p> <p>Elsewhere, any increase in precipitation is not enough to counter the rate of ice melt and places that are wholly reliant on meltwater for irrigation are feeling the effects soonest. \u201cSprings have dried drastically in the past 10 years without meltwater and because infrastructure has cut off discharge,\u201d says Aditi Mukherji, one of the authors of the IPCC report.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a582f91949e798fa829a84df3d668f181161e34e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a582f91949e798fa829a84df3d668f181161e34e/0_120_3872_2323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man tends a vegetable plot in the Karakoram range.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man tends a vegetable plot in the Karakoram range.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Dafos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Known as high-altitude deserts, places such as Ladakh in north-eastern India and parts of Tibet have already lost many of their lower-altitude glaciers and with them their seasonal irrigation flows, which is affecting agriculture and electricity production from hydroelectric dams.

So although mountain communities are suffering from glacial disappearance, those downstream are currently less affected because rainfall makes a much larger contribution to rivers such as the Ganges and Mekong as they descend into populated basins.

      "bodyText": "Many moons ago in Tibet, the Second Buddha transformed a fierce nyen (a malevolent mountain demon) into a neri (the holiest protective warrior god) called Khawa Karpo, who took up residence in the sacred mountain bearing his name. Khawa Karpo is the tallest of the Meili mountain range, piercing the sky at 6,740 metres (22,112ft) above sea level. Local Tibetan communities believe that conquering Khawa Karpo is an act of sacrilege and would cause the deity to abandon his mountain home. Nevertheless, there have been several failed attempts by outsiders \u2013 the best known by an international team of 17, all of whom died in an avalanche during their ascent on 3 January 1991. After much local petitioning, in 2001 Beijing passed a law banning mountaineering there. However, Khawa Karpo continues to be affronted more insidiously. Over the past two decades, the Mingyong glacier at the foot of the mountain has dramatically receded. Villagers blame disrespectful human behaviour, including an inadequacy of prayer, greater material greed and an increase in pollution from tourism. People have started to avoid eating garlic and onions, burning meat, breaking vows or fighting for fear of unleashing the wrath of the deity. Mingyong is one of the world\u2019s fastest shrinking glaciers, but locals cannot believe it will die because their own existence is intertwined with it. Yet its disappearance is almost inevitable. Khawa Karpo lies at the world\u2019s \u201cthird pole\u201d. This is how glaciologists refer to the Tibetan plateau, home to the vast Hindu Kush-Himalaya ice sheet, because it contains the largest amount of snow and ice after the Arctic and Antarctic \u2013 the Chinese glaciers alone account for an estimated 14.5% of the global total. However, a quarter of its ice has been lost since 1970. This month, in a long-awaited special report on the cryosphere by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists will warn that up to two-thirds of the region\u2019s remaining glaciers are on track to disappear by the end of the century. It is expected a third of the ice will be lost in that time even if the internationally agreed target of limiting global warming by 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is adhered to. Whether we are Buddhists or not, our lives affect, and are affected by, these tropical glaciers that span eight countries. This frozen \u201cwater tower of Asia\u201d is the source of 10 of the world\u2019s largest rivers, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yellow, Mekong and Indus, whose flows support at least 1.6 billion people directly \u2013 in drinking water, agriculture, hydropower and livelihoods \u2013 and many more indirectly, in buying a T-shirt made from cotton grown in China, for example, or rice from India. Joseph Shea, a glaciologist at the University of Northern British Columbia, calls the loss \u201cdepressing and fear-inducing. It changes the nature of the mountains in a very visible and profound way.\u201d Yet the fast-changing conditions at the third pole have not received the same attention as those at the north and south poles. The IPCC\u2019s fourth assessment report in 2007 contained the erroneous prediction that all Himalayan glaciers would be gone by 2035. This statement turned out to have been based on anecdote rather than scientific evidence and, perhaps out of embarrassment, the third pole has been given less attention in subsequent IPCC reports. There is also a dearth of research compared to the other poles, and what hydrological data exists has been jealously guarded by the Indian government and other interested parties. The Tibetan plateau is a vast and impractical place for glaciologists to work in and confounding factors make measurements hard to obtain. Scientists are forbidden by locals, for instance, to step out on to the Mingyong glacier, meaning they have had to use repeat photography to measure the ice retreat. In the face of these problems, satellites have proved invaluable, allowing scientists to watch glacial shrinkage in real time. This summer, Columbia University researchers also used declassified spy-satellite images from the cold war to show that third pole ice loss has accelerated over this century and is now roughly double the melt rate of 1975 to 2000, when temperatures were on average 1C lower. Glaciers in the region are currently losing about half a vertical metre of ice per year because of anthropogenic global heating, the researchers concluded. Glacial melt here carries significant risk of death and injury \u2013 far more than in the sparsely populated Arctic and Antarctic \u2013 from glacial lake outbursts (when a lake forms and suddenly spills over its banks in a devastating flood) and landslides caused by destabilised rock. Whole villages have been washed away and these events are becoming increasingly regular, even if monitoring and rescue systems have improved. Satellite data shows that numbers and sizes of such risky lakes in the region are growing. Last October and November, on three separate occasions, debris blocked the flow of the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet, threatening India and Bangladesh downstream with flooding and causing thousands to be evacuated. One reason for the rapid ice loss is that the Tibetan plateau, like the other two poles, is warming at a rate up to three times as fast as the global average, by 0.3C per decade. In the case of the third pole, this is because of its elevation, which means it absorbs energy from rising, warm, moisture-laden air. Even if average global temperatures stay below 1.5C, the region will experience more than 2C of warming; if emissions are not reduced, the rise will be 5C, according to a report released earlier this year by more than 200 scientists for the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). Winter snowfall is already decreasing and there are, on average, four fewer cold nights and seven more warm nights per year than 40 years ago. Models also indicate a strengthening of the south-east monsoon, with heavy and unpredictable downpours. \u201cThis is the climate crisis you haven\u2019t heard of,\u201d said ICIMOD\u2019s chief scientist, Philippus Wester. There is another culprit besides our CO2 emissions in this warming story, and it\u2019s all too evident on the dirty surface of the Mingyong glacier: black carbon, or soot. A 2013 study found that black carbon is responsible for 1.1 watts per square metre of the Earth\u2019s surface of extra energy being stored in the atmosphere (CO2 is responsible for an estimated 1.56 watts per square metre). Black carbon has multiple climate effects, changing clouds and monsoon circulation as well as accelerating ice melt.

Climatologists believe that the sudden and massive growth of irrigated agriculture in the local area, coupled with unusual topographical features, has produced an increase in snowfall on the glaciers which currently more than compensates for their melting. Elsewhere, any increase in precipitation is not enough to counter the rate of ice melt and places that are wholly reliant on meltwater for irrigation are feeling the effects soonest. \u201cSprings have dried drastically in the past 10 years without meltwater and because infrastructure has cut off discharge,\u201d says Aditi Mukherji, one of the authors of the IPCC report. Known as high-altitude deserts, places such as Ladakh in north-eastern India and parts of Tibet have already lost many of their lower-altitude glaciers and with them their seasonal irrigation flows, which is affecting agriculture and electricity production from hydroelectric dams.

Depop has more than 15m registered users, Raga says, of whom \u201c90% are 26 or under\u201d. A Depop user as old as Allen, who is 34, is rare. In a recent <em>New York</em> magazine <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/08/depop-app-gen-z.html#_ga=2.78466972.96653372.1567691647-56436060.1567691647\" title=\"\">article</a>, the writer Matthew Schneier described Depop as \u201ca siren pitched at a frequency easiest for teens and the recently teenage to hear\u201d. It has been manufactured that way. \u201cThe mission,\u201d Raga says, earnestly, \u201cis to power young, entrepreneurial, creative people\u2026 because we think they\u2019re the ones that will change the world.\u201d Of the app\u2019s users, she explains: \u201cThey are in that period of their lives where they are figuring out for themselves what they want to do in the future and we want to give them an opportunity. To support them in their journey.\u201d</p> <p>The journey usually begins in a user\u2019s bedroom. \u201cWhat happens is they start selling clothes from their wardrobes,\u201d Raga says. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty much mobile natives, so they know how to get the ball rolling.\u201d For casual users, that is enough. Depop pays out pocket money. It is the new paper round. But others seem born to the process, understand the power and value in sharing their particular tastes with the world, and the journey continues. They pillage charity shops. They create inventory. Slowly, they generate a following. And then they begin to sell so many items that, in a few cases at least, the gig becomes full-time. Earlier this year, it was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/style/internet-girl-depop.html\" title=\"\">reported</a> that one of the app\u2019s top sellers, Bella McFadden, or <a href=\"https://www.depop.com/internetgirl/\" title=\"\">@internetgirl</a>, used the app to haul a six-figure income. She is 23. She is not the only Depop mogul.</p> <p>\u201cWe make it super easy for people to start a business,\u201d Raga says. In this way she believes the app provides a great social service. \u201cWe\u2019re teaching. We\u2019re helping people learn what it takes to be successful.\u201d But a warning: \u201cYou <em>have</em> to be talented, you know? This is not something everybody can be successful at. You also have to have taste. You have to be super creative. And you need to be passionate about it.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Raga joined Depop</strong></em> in 2014, when she was 35. \u201cOperations and finance,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t C-suite at the time.\u201d She had been working as a Groupon executive (\u201cWhen it was, like, super exciting\u201d), but she\u2019d watched the company struggle to create a decent mobile platform, and \u201cit was very obvious that mobile was <em>the</em> next platform\u201d. She liked that Depop was mobile-first. And she liked that it was fashion. In 2016, when the company\u2019s founding CEO left, she was asked by the board to take over.</p> <p>Depop was already building a huge community of young users. \u201cThey were using social in a smart way,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the business was very organic.\u201d So she took the job.</p> <p>Under Raga\u2019s direction, Depop has surged remarkably, though most of its growth remains organic \u2013 a friend tells a friend, a friend <em>buys</em> from a friend. \u201cIn 2018, there was an 85% year-on-year growth in sales,\u201d Raga says. Depop takes a 10% cut of every item sold through the app, but does not share total sales figures, though the website Techcrunch recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/depop-ceo-maria-raga-tells-us-everything-about-social-e-commerce-at-disrupt-berlin/\" title=\"\">reported</a> that Depop \u201chas handled more than $500m of gross merchandise value since its launch\u201d in 2011. The company is now active in 147 countries and, though it is headquartered in the UK, where most of its 196 full-time employees work, its popularity is rising faster in the US, where Raga has overseen the opening of two bricks-and-mortar shops and the rollout of traditional marketing campaigns. \u201cIt\u2019s our key strategy to grow in the US,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger market.\u201d</p> <p>She seems right to make a push now. Raga does not see Depop as a threat to the fashion industry, but she does understand that it is changing. Traditional retail is struggling, she thinks, and fast fashion is all but dead. \u201cConsumers are realising it\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d she says, \u201cand the brands know as well. There are reports that show that in five years resale will be <em>as big as</em> fast fashion.\u201d</p> <p>The reports are taken from a <a href=\"https://www.thredup.com/resale\" title=\"\">recent paper</a>, published by ThredUp, the online secondhand store, in which it was suggested the secondhand clothing market will be worth $51bn by 2023. Last month the department stores Macy\u2019s and JC Penney announced they planned to partner with ThredUp to stock locations across the US with used women\u2019s clothing. \u201cIt\u2019s the way things are moving,\u201d Raga says. Resale\u2019s stock is rising. \u201cThe fashion industry is extremely polluting!\u201d</p> <p>Depop appeals to young people because young people like to buy cool clothes. But really it appeals because it plays so acutely to a spectrum of teenage ethics and sensibilities: to save the planet from falling apart, sustainability is good and fast fashion is bad; that trends now emerge sideways from the community not top-down from creative directors; that the speciality of today\u2019s 18-year-old is the ability to create a life online, so why not a business, too?</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re extending the life of the garment,\u201d Raga puts it, simply, \u201cwhich resonates.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>A while after</strong></em> I met Raga, I messaged a Depop user named Freddie (<a href=\"https://www.depop.com/shoeshifter/\" title=\"\">@shoeshifter</a>; 23,000 followers) about his habit.</p> <p>Is Depop your job? \u201cMore of a hobby.\u201d</p> <p>Do your parents understand what you do? \u201cPretty much not at all.\u201d</p> <p>How do you feel about the future? \u201cI feel like, as a young person, the chance of getting a job that is consistent and actually well-paid is rare\u2026 Most folk I know have multiple sources of income.\u201d</p> <p>Freddie is 21. He works in a leisure centre part-time. If he were to have it his own way, he might sell clothes on Depop for a living, but he\u2019s not sure. Could that really be his full-time gig? Sourcing clothes, selling clothes, making money?</p> <p>Sometimes Freddie makes \u00a3500 in a day, but those are the good days. Every now and then he\u2019ll make no money for two weeks straight, and he\u2019ll be at the leisure centre thinking about all the other ways he might make a decent income, what else he might do with his life. This isn\u2019t an uncommon Depop experience \u2013 the ups and downs, the unsureness. Not everyone makes it big! Neither is anxiety about the future of the jobs market specific to Freddie.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a generation that is <em>not</em> hopeful about the future,\u201d Raga says. They have grown up through a global financial crisis. They have seen money slip away. They have been introduced to political life as though Trump and Brexit were normal politics. When they think of the coming decades, they wonder whether traditional jobs will still exist. \u201cThey are <em>surrounded</em> by bad news,\u201d she says.</p> <p>When Freddie talks about \u201cmultiple streams of income,\u201d he is talking about what Raga calls \u201cthe side-hustle\u201d. \u201cThey do not think careers are going to be step-by-step,\u201d she says. (She puts \u201cstep-by-step\u201d in air commas.) \u201cThey might want to be a musician, they might also have a Depop shop, and they also do something else. They are comfortable doing that,\u201d she thinks, \u201cbecause they are able to financially sustain themselves by doing those things.\u201d Raga is describing an entire cohort subscribing to the gig economy, as though it were not just cool and hip, but necessary and exciting. This is a good thing, she argues. \u201cTechnology is allowing people to earn money in a way they weren\u2019t able to before. Right now, all those old models are shifting. And it\u2019s giving people opportunities in completely different ways.\u201d</p> <h2>Meet the sellers\u2026</h2> <h2>Magdalena Majewska, 30, <em><a href=\"https://www.depop.com/amslalaland/\">@amslalaland</a> (</em><strong>41,468 followers)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b61fececeeec2915bdfe164a4b03267e5fb414f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b61fececeeec2915bdfe164a4b03267e5fb414f6/0_0_1968_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I sell vintage clothing from the 70s, 80s, 90s and early 2000s\u2019: Magdalena Majewska.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I sell vintage clothing from the 70s, 80s, 90s and early 2000s\u2019: Magdalena Majewska</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: https://www.depop.com/amslalaland/</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I started using Depop almost three years ago. It\u2019s not my main source of income, but I sell daily and I\u2019d like it to be, which is why I\u2019m trying to rebrand: better photos, better lighting, a particular style of clothing. I sell vintage clothing from the 70s, 80s, 90s and early 2000s. Rare or top-quality stuff; some designer pieces \u2013 things that reflect my own interests. I mainly source items from Poland, which is where I\u2019m from, but I travel a lot and I\u2019ve stocked items from Tokyo and Scotland. My customers are from all over the world, and they\u2019re not just girls. I spend about two and a half hours on the app daily \u2013 sales mainly \u2013 and I make around \u00a3200 a week. There have been some weeks when I\u2019ve earned \u00a31,000 and others when I\u2019ve sold nothing at all. There\u2019s no seasonal pattern to it. It\u2019s random. What\u2019s the ambition? I\u2019d like to own a physical store, selling clothes, accessories, things I find interesting. To be able to dedicate my time to sourcing clothes\u2026 that would be awesome.</p> <h2>Asal Tehrani, 22, <em><a href=\"https://www.depop.com/susamusa/\">@susamusa</a> (</em><strong>68,767 followers)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0501d0ca9118701a19e95674046f6399c23bad9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0501d0ca9118701a19e95674046f6399c23bad9d/59_258_2746_1648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m a shopaholic, but now I\u2019m buying for other people\u2019: Asal Tehrani.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m a shopaholic, but now I\u2019m buying for other people\u2019: Asal Tehrani</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @susamusa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I started during my first week of university.

She liked that Depop was mobile-first. And she liked that it was fashion. In 2016, when the company\u2019s founding CEO left, she was asked by the board to take over. Depop was already building a huge community of young users. \u201cThey were using social in a smart way,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the business was very organic.\u201d So she took the job. Under Raga\u2019s direction, Depop has surged remarkably, though most of its growth remains organic \u2013 a friend tells a friend, a friend buys from a friend. \u201cIn 2018, there was an 85% year-on-year growth in sales,\u201d Raga says. Depop takes a 10% cut of every item sold through the app, but does not share total sales figures, though the website Techcrunch recently reported that Depop \u201chas handled more than $500m of gross merchandise value since its launch\u201d in 2011. The company is now active in 147 countries and, though it is headquartered in the UK, where most of its 196 full-time employees work, its popularity is rising faster in the US, where Raga has overseen the opening of two bricks-and-mortar shops and the rollout of traditional marketing campaigns. \u201cIt\u2019s our key strategy to grow in the US,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger market.\u201d She seems right to make a push now. Raga does not see Depop as a threat to the fashion industry, but she does understand that it is changing. Traditional retail is struggling, she thinks, and fast fashion is all but dead. \u201cConsumers are realising it\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d she says, \u201cand the brands know as well. There are reports that show that in five years resale will be as big as fast fashion.\u201d The reports are taken from a recent paper, published by ThredUp, the online secondhand store, in which it was suggested the secondhand clothing market will be worth $51bn by 2023. Last month the department stores Macy\u2019s and JC Penney announced they planned to partner with ThredUp to stock locations across the US with used women\u2019s clothing. \u201cIt\u2019s the way things are moving,\u201d Raga says. Resale\u2019s stock is rising. \u201cThe fashion industry is extremely polluting!\u201d Depop appeals to young people because young people like to buy cool clothes. But really it appeals because it plays so acutely to a spectrum of teenage ethics and sensibilities: to save the planet from falling apart, sustainability is good and fast fashion is bad; that trends now emerge sideways from the community not top-down from creative directors; that the speciality of today\u2019s 18-year-old is the ability to create a life online, so why not a business, too? \u201cWe\u2019re extending the life of the garment,\u201d Raga puts it, simply, \u201cwhich resonates.\u201d A while after I met Raga, I messaged a Depop user named Freddie (@shoeshifter; 23,000 followers) about his habit. Is Depop your job? \u201cMore of a hobby.\u201d Do your parents understand what you do? \u201cPretty much not at all.\u201d How do you feel about the future? \u201cI feel like, as a young person, the chance of getting a job that is consistent and actually well-paid is rare\u2026 Most folk I know have multiple sources of income.\u201d Freddie is 21. He works in a leisure centre part-time. If he were to have it his own way, he might sell clothes on Depop for a living, but he\u2019s not sure. Could that really be his full-time gig? Sourcing clothes, selling clothes, making money? Sometimes Freddie makes \u00a3500 in a day, but those are the good days. Every now and then he\u2019ll make no money for two weeks straight, and he\u2019ll be at the leisure centre thinking about all the other ways he might make a decent income, what else he might do with his life. This isn\u2019t an uncommon Depop experience \u2013 the ups and downs, the unsureness. Not everyone makes it big! Neither is anxiety about the future of the jobs market specific to Freddie. \u201cThis is a generation that is not hopeful about the future,\u201d Raga says. They have grown up through a global financial crisis. They have seen money slip away. They have been introduced to political life as though Trump and Brexit were normal politics. When they think of the coming decades, they wonder whether traditional jobs will still exist. \u201cThey are surrounded by bad news,\u201d she says. When Freddie talks about \u201cmultiple streams of income,\u201d he is talking about what Raga calls \u201cthe side-hustle\u201d. \u201cThey do not think careers are going to be step-by-step,\u201d she says. (She puts \u201cstep-by-step\u201d in air commas.) \u201cThey might want to be a musician, they might also have a Depop shop, and they also do something else. They are comfortable doing that,\u201d she thinks, \u201cbecause they are able to financially sustain themselves by doing those things.\u201d Raga is describing an entire cohort subscribing to the gig economy, as though it were not just cool and hip, but necessary and exciting. This is a good thing, she argues. \u201cTechnology is allowing people to earn money in a way they weren\u2019t able to before. Right now, all those old models are shifting. And it\u2019s giving people opportunities in completely different ways.\u201d Meet the sellers\u2026 Magdalena Majewska, 30, @amslalaland (41,468 followers) I started using Depop almost three years ago. It\u2019s not my main source of income, but I sell daily and I\u2019d like it to be, which is why I\u2019m trying to rebrand: better photos, better lighting, a particular style of clothing. I sell vintage clothing from the 70s, 80s, 90s and early 2000s. Rare or top-quality stuff; some designer pieces \u2013 things that reflect my own interests. I mainly source items from Poland, which is where I\u2019m from, but I travel a lot and I\u2019ve stocked items from Tokyo and Scotland. My customers are from all over the world, and they\u2019re not just girls. I spend about two and a half hours on the app daily \u2013 sales mainly \u2013 and I make around \u00a3200 a week. There have been some weeks when I\u2019ve earned \u00a31,000 and others when I\u2019ve sold nothing at all. There\u2019s no seasonal pattern to it. It\u2019s random. What\u2019s the ambition? I\u2019d like to own a physical store, selling clothes, accessories, things I find interesting. To be able to dedicate my time to sourcing clothes\u2026 that would be awesome. Asal Tehrani, 22, @susamusa (68,767 followers) I started during my first week of university. I was 19 then and I just had so many clothes: Nike jumpers, old stuff. I thought, I have to get rid of this! So I started selling my own stuff. I didn\u2019t think of it as a business, but everything I posted sold in a day, and I thought: \u2018Where can I buy more?\u2019 I\u2019m a shopaholic, but now I\u2019m buying for other people. I\u2019ve sold 13,299 items. I read chemistry at uni, but this is my full-time job, and I can\u2019t imagine a better-suited one. There are slow weeks, when people are on holiday, away from their phones. But there are surges during people\u2019s downtime, like between 9pm and 11pm, when girls are going to bed, or watching TV, and just scrolling. Tom Evans, 22, @areaeighteen (13,246 followers) I\u2019ve been an entrepreneur since I was 14, and I see an opportunity in Depop to bring together my interests: dance, the LGBTQ community, social image. My main message is about gender nonconformity \u2013 I sell clothes for everyone. I\u2019m a dancer, but my aim is to make Depop my full-time job. Social media has given our generation great freedom to not do the 9 to 5.",

The <em>Observer</em>\u2019s photographer makes one last request and it doesn\u2019t sound simple: would she lie down on that sofa over there so he can snap her from the gallery above? Furniture is rearranged. They\u2019ve already had an hour. Inwardly I\u2019m an emoji scream. DiDonato is right there, splayed out Hollywood-starlet style, shoes on, off, hand this way, arm flung back, patience personified. When the shoot is over, she says how much she enjoyed it \u2013 an unheard-of response from a madly busy international opera star, just out of a long day\u2019s rehearsal.</p> <p>As we walk through the ROH\u2019s backstage warren to a private room to talk, she\u2019s instantly in offstage mode, conversational, candid, warm, funny, reflecting on the day\u2019s rehearsal. \u201cThe mood was black. I\u2019ve got to shake it off,\u201d she shudders, describing not the working atmosphere but aspects of Handel\u2019s <em>Agrippina</em> (1709), in which she sings the title role in a <a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/agrippina-by-barrie-kosky\" title=\"\">new production for the Royal Opera</a> by Barrie Kosky. This co-production with Bavarian State Opera, Munich, and Dutch National Opera is conducted by Maxim Emelyanychev in his house debut.</p> <p>DiDonato\u2019s character, the wife of the Roman emperor Claudius, is one of opera\u2019s greatest political operators. Having recorded the work for future release, and sung it at the Barbican and elsewhere, DiDonato is steeped in it. Supreme as an actor as well as a singer, she totally inhabits every role. \u201c<em>Agrippina </em>feels like the most modern drama, helped by the fact of Barrie\u2019s production being timeless. I\u2019ve got plenty of role models in mind \u2013 strong, wounded, slightly broken women. Robin Wright in <em>House of Cards</em>. Julia Louis-Dreyfus in <em>Veep</em>. Or, though she wasn\u2019t villainous, Hillary Clinton 20 years ago \u2013 the smart, super-intelligent, suffering wife. It\u2019s easy to say Agrippina\u2019s wicked, power-obsessed. But she has no choice, no place in society other than being by the side of her husband. There are definitely times, in the crowd scenes, when I feel like Melania Trump: the cameras are there, darling.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I stood there thinking, screw anyone who dares to say opera\u2019s not relevant</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The previous week, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoyceDiDonato/status/1164836192099028992\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a>, DiDonato had described the air in the rehearsal room not as black, but blue. \u201cHa, yes. That was about swearing at the difficulties of learning the part. It\u2019s the densest, most elaborate, largest Italian text that must exist in opera. Agrippina has so much information to impart, so many things to resolve. And she\u2019s three steps ahead of all the useless men around her. It\u2019s constant information, manipulation, plotting and resolving. The story unfolds like rolling news today. And I keep saying, this is genius. How did Handel know the human psyche so profoundly? He\u2019s the composer who\u2019s taught me most. I\u2019d put <em>Agrippina</em> up there with<em> Richard III</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Born Joyce Flaherty in Prairie Village, Kansas, in 1969, the sixth of seven children in an Irish-American family, DiDonato was immersed in music from the start. Her father, a local architect, directed the church choir; her mother was the organist. Joyce expected to become a music teacher, and wrestled with her conscience when the pull of a professional singing career proved irresistible. \u201cMy childhood was quite strict. My parents were very observant Catholics. It was your duty in life to find your vocation and serve God. I thought mine was to teach. I saw poverty, abuse, need, in schools. How could I square this with the enormous fun, the selfishness, of performing? My dad, who I was really close to, said something so wise: \u2018You know, Joyce, there is more than one way to teach\u2026\u2019 That gave me permission to go to the dark side. I still want to feel I\u2019m in service.\u201d</p> <p>This sense of responsibility, and that instinct to teach, is perhaps why she spends so much time giving masterclasses, online and <a href=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gy33-hUTq9Y?start=393&amp;end=1457&amp;version=3\" title=\"\">in person</a>. Keenly alert to issues of social and political justice, DiDonato\u2019s most personal project so far has been <em><a href=\"http://inwarandpeace.com/\" title=\"\">In War and Peace: Harmony Through Music</a></em>, a themed album of baroque arias by Purcell, Monteverdi and others. It was her response to the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken it across the world \u2013 Istanbul, Moscow, Beijing just steps away from Tiananmen Square, Abu Dhabi in front of sheikhs and diplomats \u2013 all with this identical message of peace.\u201d She will end the tour at the Kennedy Center, Washington DC, in November. \u201cI mean, how radically different is the world from when I launched this in November 2016, six days after Trump was elected? I\u2019m a musician, a performer, but I\u2019m a citizen. I\u2019m in a privileged position. I understand that. I\u2019m trying to find the right balance between being an activist and reminding everyone of the joy of music.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9CYkJmlG8k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V9CYkJmlG8k?start=173&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=173\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9CYkJmlG8k&amp;t=173s\">Watch Joyce DiDonato give a masterclass at the Royal Opera House.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>To that end she works with inmates <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFBBuFeCEjE\" title=\"\">at Sing Sing</a>, a maximum security prison in New York State, as part of Carnegie Hall\u2019s outreach programme. The experience, apart from anything, has helped her interpretation of Sister Helen Prejean in Jake Heggie\u2019s opera <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/04/dead-man-walking-jake-heggie-joyce-didonato-das-rheingold-lpo-jurowski\" title=\"\">Dead Man Walking</a></em>, about a convicted murderer on death row. \u201cI want everyone to understand how transformative this stuff \u2013 opera \u2013 can be. As long as there\u2019s context, as long as you take people by the hand, they can find a way into this unfamiliar world. I went into Sing Sing and sang a bit of the Hallelujah chorus. All the men joined in, they knew the tune. Then I said OK, I\u2019m going to sing some more music by the guy who wrote that \u2013 Handel.\u201d</p> <p>She chose <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p070wcch\" title=\"\">Pianger\u00f2</a> from <em>Giulio Cesare</em>. \u201cI said, this is Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile, and she\u2019s going to cry, then in the middle section she\u2019s going to swear revenge, and get the guy who took the man she loved. I got to the middle bit, all ferocious. And they started shouting out: \u2018Get him, make him pay!\u2019 They completely got it, viscerally. When I came back to the weeping, you could hear a pin drop\u2026 I stood there thinking, screw anyone who dares to say opera\u2019s not relevant. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>DiDonato\u2019s career was relatively slow to take off. In her late 20s she revamped her vocal technique. A youthful marriage ended in divorce, as did a later one, but she kept her first husband\u2019s name. Nicknamed the Yankee Diva and singing in many US regional opera houses, such as Houston Grand Opera, her star rose rapidly in the 2000/1 season with her debut at La Scala, Milan, quickly followed by other European houses including, in 2003, the Royal Opera House in Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s <em>The Cunning Little Vixen</em>. Since then she has returned many times to Covent Garden, notably in works by Mozart, Donizetti and Rossini (singing in <em>Il barbiere di Siviglia</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/06/opera-rossini-joyce-didonato\" title=\"\">with her leg in plaster</a> after an onstage fracture).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"948ea13cf559ccd123f38a471de7d107e54cb650\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/948ea13cf559ccd123f38a471de7d107e54cb650/0_0_2464_1648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DiDonato, left as Fox, with Dawn Upshaw as Vixen Sharp Ears in The Cunning Little Vixen at the Royal Opera House, 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DiDonato, left, as Fox, with Dawn Upshaw as Vixen Sharp Ears in The Cunning Little Vixen at the Royal Opera House, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEarly on, it was clear my voice was suited to lighter repertoire \u2013 Handel, Mozart, Rossini \u2013 and gradually and carefully I\u2019ve broadened that out, always returning to Handel. That feels like home base.\u201d She has the clarity, flexibility and agility this music needs, leaving the purity of the vocal line intact, as well as the ability to drop to nothing, then expand thrillingly. \u201cI love the challenge of asking my voice to serve the emotional temperature. It has to be demonic and seraphic. If you can crack open a heart \u2013 and I know this sounds a bit fluffy \u2013 and make it harder for someone to go to bed at night and switch off, that\u2019s the power of music. Every human being, rich or poor, deserves that experience.

      "body": "<p>This week LeBron James, Bernie Sanders and countless other heavy hitters lent their support to a monumental bill in California that, if passed, could forever alter the business of collegiate athletics and the entire American sports landscape. SB 206 (also known as the Fair Pay to Play Act) would permit collegiate athletes in the state, which include schools like USC, UCLA, UC Berkeley and Stanford, to seek payment for use of their name, image or likeness.</p> <p>The NCAA, the governing body for college sports in America, has long prohibited its student-athletes from earning any semblance of profit associated with their skill set or name cache. Meanwhile college sports are a $14bn industry, and the NCAA reported a staggering $1.1bn in revenue generated last year, thanks in large part to the unpaid labor of its athletes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/14/rich-paul-rule-lebron-james-ncaa-basketball\">The Rich Paul Rule is proof the NCAA knows its days are numbered | Etan Thomas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The California state assembly this week voted unanimously in favor of the bill. It is expected to overwhelmingly pass in the California state senate soon, and then will land on the desk of California governor Gavin Newsom, who will have 30 days to sign or veto the bill.</p> <p>Fair Pay to Play does not require schools to alter their methods of recruiting or increase their scholarships minimums. It simply allows athletes to earn spending money in a multitude of currently prohibited ways, such as selling their memorabilia, signing endorsement deals or even offering private lessons.</p> <p>The stark disparity in income between the players and those in the NCAA\u2019s web of wealth has long been part of the national conversation, and the intensity has heightened with the possibility of SB 206 becoming reality.</p> <p>As James <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/1169631712009080832?s=20\">tweeted</a> to his 43.6m followers, \u201cEveryone is California- call your politicians and tell them to support SB 206! This law is a GAME CHANGER. College athletes can responsibly get paid for what they do and the billions they create.\u201d</p> <p>With the bill\u2019s fate on the brink, NCAA president Mark Emmert wrote a fiery letter to Newsom on Wednesday demanding he veto. Emmert called the act \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and threatened to boot California schools from NCAA competition, citing an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d.</p> <p>The bill\u2019s co-author, state senator Nancy Skinner fired back at Emmert, calling his bluff and noting that the NCAA has lost many anti-trust decisions in the past.</p> <p>Understanding the battle between the players, who many consider \u201c<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/02/27/jalen-rose-ncaa-system-indentured-servitude/374342002/\">indentured servants,\u201d</a> the deep-moneyed NCAA, and the college sports purists who strongly believe in the amateur-professional divide requires a deeper examination of this contentious landscape.</p> <h2><strong>Bleak picture for student-athletes</strong></h2> <p>Late 2011 was the final straw for Tim Nevius. The then-NCAA investigator had been the lead investigator in the Ohio State tattoo \u201cscandal\u201d, in which several star players, including quarterback Terrelle Pryor, were suspended for five games for selling memorabilia in exchange for free and discounted tattoos. The intensity of the media coverage and the punishment, it all seemed so blown of out proportion to Nevius.</p> <p>\u201cThere was an element of discomfort as I worked on more and more cases and seeing what the universities were making off the talents of those young people and their inability to capitalize on their own skill,\u201d Nevius says.</p> <p>A year later he visited Jermil Martin, a former Ohio State running back who transferred after he was punished for exchanging memorabilia for a discount on a Chevy Tahoe. Martin never graduated college and was trying to get by in a rough neighborhood outside of Columbus, his dreams of earning a top education and launching a successful football career out of reach. Martin had tears in his eyes as he described being taken advantage of and how his life fell apart simply because of a discounted vehicle.</p> <p>Nevius couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He left the NCAA and soon thereafter founded Nevius Legal, a company that helps college athletes navigate the NCAA\u2019s 400-page ever-changing rule book and all aspects of compliance. He more recently launched the College Athlete Advocacy Initiative, which lobbies for institutional reform. CAAI recently released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_8HSY3uTCU\">searing ad</a> spotlighting the plight of the student athlete which for many is darker than it seems.</p> <p>When a school grants a player a scholarship they are essentially trading employment for a free (or reduced cost) education. Thanks to a 2015 victorious federal lawsuit by former UCLA basketball star Ed O\u2019Bannon against the NCAA, athletes on full scholarship are also eligible for a cost-of-living stipend, though it is often just enough for the basics. The athlete must operate under a litany of complex rules without the assistance of an agent or a union. Heavy fines, stripped eligibility and other punishments are only a minor misstep away.</p> <p>The NCAA touts the value of a free education. For some this is true. You will hear about players like Andrew Luck, who earned an engineering degree from Stanford, or other payers who would thrive with or without football. But for many, especially the African Americans who live below the poverty line and make up a significant portion of basketball and football rosters in elite conferences, the reality is more grim.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://news.usc.edu/138228/leading-sports-schools-black-athletes-graduation-rates-lower/\">2018 report</a> from USC\u2019s Race and Equity Center, just 55% of black athletes from the Power Five conferences, which includecollege sports\u2019 most profitable programs, graduate in six years as compared to 69.3% of all student-athletes.</p> <p>Nevius says that many of those graduates are left with hollow futures. \u201cEverything is designed around the university and coach\u2019s priority of sports first so they\u2019re clustered into these majors that may not align with their academic interest and oftentimes do not give them the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in life beyond sports,\u201d he says.</p> <p>According to the NCAA, <a href=\"https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Recruiting%20Fact%20Sheet%20WEB.pdf\">fewer than 2%</a> of college athletes go on to play professional sports.</p> <h2><strong>The NCAA is drowning in money</strong></h2> <p>In any organization that generates billions, top employees will pocket significant salaries. But in the NCAA, the figures are astronomical. Alabama football coach Nick Saban will make $8.3m this year. Kansas basketball coach Bill Self will make $7.9m. Emmert will take home $2.4m. In fact, the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22454170/highest-paid-state-employees-include-ncaa-coaches-nick-saban-john-calipari-dabo-swinney-bill-self-bob-huggins\">highest-paid state employee</a> in 39 of the 50 states is a college football or basketball coach. These coaches can earn additional money from radio appearances, endorsement deals and, really, in any way they choose.</p> <p>Much of the NCAA\u2019s revenue comes from television contracts. Its March Madness rights packages with CBS and Turner Sports bring in $800m in revenue alone. Passage of SB 206 would not make a dent in televisions contract figures or any aspect of the NCAA\u2019s nonstop flow of cash. It would simply afford athletes the chance to profit off their sliver of time as an expert in their field. As Skinner has pointed out, this is especially true for female athletes who have virtually no options in the professional sports market.</p> <p>The NCAA asserts that amateurism protects a number of potential pitfalls, ranging from an uneven playing field to players living off campus to a reduced focus on academics. The swelling number of dissenters say these notions are baseless, an example of fear-mongering and an attempt for the NCAA maintain control of an antiquated system.</p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s next?</strong></h2> <p>If SB 206 is signed into law, the NCAA could ban California schools from competing in its association as Emmert threatens. But taking that route would cost the NCAA significant amounts of revenue and an ungodly legal bill as this battle would likely head to the courts. It would also, as Emmert suggests, give California schools an advantage in recruiting even if they had to form some kind of independent league. Given this reality, passage of the bill could eventually force the NCAA to follow suit.</p> <p>The more symbiotic move would be for the NCAA to work with lawmakers and enact the bill (or a similar version) across schools nationwide. There are the purists who want to protect the sanctity of amateurism yet each new bill and lawsuit is an inch closer to the inevitable.</p> <p>While passage of SB 206 would barrel away from amateurism in its purist form, there is a still a massive disparity between what a college athlete would make selling a jersey or offering hitting lessons vs. a professional athlete salary. Yet the ability to make some semblance of money might keep some elite athletes from declaring early, which would in turn generate even more revenue for the member school and the NCAA.</p> <p>Passage of SB 206 seems rational on several fronts, but Nevius doesn\u2019t see the multi-billion dollar entity that is the NCAA acquiescing without a continued fight.</p> <p>\u201cI just think it\u2019s so wasteful and tone deaf. This is the way things are going and it\u2019s widely recognized as the fair and right thing to do but the NCAA in the interest of money and control refuses to allow to this happen as it should. It\u2019s beyond disappointing, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "This week LeBron James, Bernie Sanders and countless other heavy hitters lent their support to a monumental bill in California that, if passed, could forever alter the business of collegiate athletics and the entire American sports landscape. SB 206 (also known as the Fair Pay to Play Act) would permit collegiate athletes in the state, which include schools like USC, UCLA, UC Berkeley and Stanford, to seek payment for use of their name, image or likeness. The NCAA, the governing body for college sports in America, has long prohibited its student-athletes from earning any semblance of profit associated with their skill set or name cache. Meanwhile college sports are a $14bn industry, and the NCAA reported a staggering $1.1bn in revenue generated last year, thanks in large part to the unpaid labor of its athletes. The California state assembly this week voted unanimously in favor of the bill. It is expected to overwhelmingly pass in the California state senate soon, and then will land on the desk of California governor Gavin Newsom, who will have 30 days to sign or veto the bill. Fair Pay to Play does not require schools to alter their methods of recruiting or increase their scholarships minimums. It simply allows athletes to earn spending money in a multitude of currently prohibited ways, such as selling their memorabilia, signing endorsement deals or even offering private lessons. The stark disparity in income between the players and those in the NCAA\u2019s web of wealth has long been part of the national conversation, and the intensity has heightened with the possibility of SB 206 becoming reality. As James tweeted to his 43.6m followers, \u201cEveryone is California- call your politicians and tell them to support SB 206! This law is a GAME CHANGER. College athletes can responsibly get paid for what they do and the billions they create.\u201d With the bill\u2019s fate on the brink, NCAA president Mark Emmert wrote a fiery letter to Newsom on Wednesday demanding he veto. Emmert called the act \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and threatened to boot California schools from NCAA competition, citing an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d. The bill\u2019s co-author, state senator Nancy Skinner fired back at Emmert, calling his bluff and noting that the NCAA has lost many anti-trust decisions in the past. Understanding the battle between the players, who many consider \u201cindentured servants,\u201d the deep-moneyed NCAA, and the college sports purists who strongly believe in the amateur-professional divide requires a deeper examination of this contentious landscape. Bleak picture for student-athletes Late 2011 was the final straw for Tim Nevius. The then-NCAA investigator had been the lead investigator in the Ohio State tattoo \u201cscandal\u201d, in which several star players, including quarterback Terrelle Pryor, were suspended for five games for selling memorabilia in exchange for free and discounted tattoos. The intensity of the media coverage and the punishment, it all seemed so blown of out proportion to Nevius. \u201cThere was an element of discomfort as I worked on more and more cases and seeing what the universities were making off the talents of those young people and their inability to capitalize on their own skill,\u201d Nevius says. A year later he visited Jermil Martin, a former Ohio State running back who transferred after he was punished for exchanging memorabilia for a discount on a Chevy Tahoe. Martin never graduated college and was trying to get by in a rough neighborhood outside of Columbus, his dreams of earning a top education and launching a successful football career out of reach. Martin had tears in his eyes as he described being taken advantage of and how his life fell apart simply because of a discounted vehicle. Nevius couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He left the NCAA and soon thereafter founded Nevius Legal, a company that helps college athletes navigate the NCAA\u2019s 400-page ever-changing rule book and all aspects of compliance. He more recently launched the College Athlete Advocacy Initiative, which lobbies for institutional reform. CAAI recently released a searing ad spotlighting the plight of the student athlete which for many is darker than it seems. When a school grants a player a scholarship they are essentially trading employment for a free (or reduced cost) education. Thanks to a 2015 victorious federal lawsuit by former UCLA basketball star Ed O\u2019Bannon against the NCAA, athletes on full scholarship are also eligible for a cost-of-living stipend, though it is often just enough for the basics. The athlete must operate under a litany of complex rules without the assistance of an agent or a union. Heavy fines, stripped eligibility and other punishments are only a minor misstep away. The NCAA touts the value of a free education. For some this is true. You will hear about players like Andrew Luck, who earned an engineering degree from Stanford, or other payers who would thrive with or without football. But for many, especially the African Americans who live below the poverty line and make up a significant portion of basketball and football rosters in elite conferences, the reality is more grim. According to 2018 report from USC\u2019s Race and Equity Center, just 55% of black athletes from the Power Five conferences, which includecollege sports\u2019 most profitable programs, graduate in six years as compared to 69.3% of all student-athletes. Nevius says that many of those graduates are left with hollow futures. \u201cEverything is designed around the university and coach\u2019s priority of sports first so they\u2019re clustered into these majors that may not align with their academic interest and oftentimes do not give them the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in life beyond sports,\u201d he says. According to the NCAA, fewer than 2% of college athletes go on to play professional sports. The NCAA is drowning in money In any organization that generates billions, top employees will pocket significant salaries. But in the NCAA, the figures are astronomical. Alabama football coach Nick Saban will make $8.3m this year. Kansas basketball coach Bill Self will make $7.9m. Emmert will take home $2.4m. In fact, the highest-paid state employee in 39 of the 50 states is a college football or basketball coach. These coaches can earn additional money from radio appearances, endorsement deals and, really, in any way they choose. Much of the NCAA\u2019s revenue comes from television contracts. Its March Madness rights packages with CBS and Turner Sports bring in $800m in revenue alone. Passage of SB 206 would not make a dent in televisions contract figures or any aspect of the NCAA\u2019s nonstop flow of cash. It would simply afford athletes the chance to profit off their sliver of time as an expert in their field. As Skinner has pointed out, this is especially true for female athletes who have virtually no options in the professional sports market. The NCAA asserts that amateurism protects a number of potential pitfalls, ranging from an uneven playing field to players living off campus to a reduced focus on academics. The swelling number of dissenters say these notions are baseless, an example of fear-mongering and an attempt for the NCAA maintain control of an antiquated system. What\u2019s next? If SB 206 is signed into law, the NCAA could ban California schools from competing in its association as Emmert threatens. But taking that route would cost the NCAA significant amounts of revenue and an ungodly legal bill as this battle would likely head to the courts. It would also, as Emmert suggests, give California schools an advantage in recruiting even if they had to form some kind of independent league. Given this reality, passage of the bill could eventually force the NCAA to follow suit. The more symbiotic move would be for the NCAA to work with lawmakers and enact the bill (or a similar version) across schools nationwide. There are the purists who want to protect the sanctity of amateurism yet each new bill and lawsuit is an inch closer to the inevitable. While passage of SB 206 would barrel away from amateurism in its purist form, there is a still a massive disparity between what a college athlete would make selling a jersey or offering hitting lessons vs. a professional athlete salary. Yet the ability to make some semblance of money might keep some elite athletes from declaring early, which would in turn generate even more revenue for the member school and the NCAA. Passage of SB 206 seems rational on several fronts, but Nevius doesn\u2019t see the multi-billion dollar entity that is the NCAA acquiescing without a continued fight. \u201cI just think it\u2019s so wasteful and tone deaf. This is the way things are going and it\u2019s widely recognized as the fair and right thing to do but the NCAA in the interest of money and control refuses to allow to this happen as it should. It\u2019s beyond disappointing, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d",

I can pass through your walls with ease.\u201d</p> <p>The novelist\u2019s series of essays, smuggled out of jail among notes to his lawyers, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/13/i-will-never-see-world-again-ahmet-altan-review\" title=\"\">lauded by critics</a> as an instant classic when it was published in Britain in spring this year, and last week it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/12/jailed-turkish-novelist-ahmet-altan-baillie-gifford-prize-longlist-i-will-never-see-the-world-agai\" title=\"\">longlisted for the \u00a350,000 Baillie Gifford nonfiction prize</a>.</p> <p>Now Altan, who has been in jail for three years on charges arising from the failed Turkish coup attempt of July 2016, has expressed his defiance through the written word once again, writing another book from his shared cell in the high-security Silivri prison.</p> <p>\u201cI have written a new novel,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em> via messages sent in and out of his prison cell. <em> </em>Like <em>I Will Never See the World Again</em>, the new title, <em>Lady Life</em>, is expected to be published in English first. A comedy set in today\u2019s Istanbul against a background of repression and political turmoil, its protagonist is a woman called Hayat, a word that means \u201clife\u201d in Turkish.</p> <p>\u201cIt tells the story of someone who doesn\u2019t take life too seriously,\u201d said Altan. \u201cShe turned out to be a character who amuses me greatly.\u201d</p> <p>According to Altan\u2019s friend Yasemin \u00c7ongar, who will translate the book into English, the novel is very funny. But always in the background is a broken society with an ailing economy, full of the \u201cnew poor\u201d, impoverished by a widespread and seemingly indiscriminate purge of so-called dissidents. \u201cThey are people whose lives have been interrupted, almost destroyed,\u201d said Congar.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the attempt to oust the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, more than 100,000 people \u2013 civil servants, teachers, judges, police officers, soldiers, journalists and academics \u2013 lost their jobs, most of them suspected of links to Fethullah G\u00fclen, a Turkish Islamic scholar exiled in the US who is accused by the authorities of masterminding the coup attempt. More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/06/turkish-government-destroys-more-than-300000-books\" title=\"\">300,000 books related</a> \u2013 and unrelated \u2013 to G\u00fclen were destroyed; and the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97aa22f4-d563-11e9-8367-807ebd53ab77\" title=\"\"> economy has slumped</a>.</p> <p>Altan, 69, a combative, provocative and outspoken opponent of the Erdo\u011fan regime, was jailed in September 2016 pending trial, alongside his brother Mehmet, 66, a writer, journalist and academic, and a former MP and journalist Nazli Ilicak, 75, for allegedly sending \u201csubliminal messages\u201d on television in support of the coup. In February 2018, with Ilicak, Altan was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/16/turkey-sentences-six-journalists-life-imprisonment-failed-coup\" title=\"\">for attempting to overthrow the government</a>. Mehmet was freed but lost his job as an economics professor.</p> <p>The sentence was greeted with outrage by writers worldwide, though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/nobel-laureates-president-erdogan-turkey-free-writers\" title=\"\">an appeal to Erdo\u011fan</a> for Ahmet Altan\u2019s release by 38 Nobel laureates \u2013 including VS Naipaul, JM Coetzee and Kazuo Ishiguro \u2013 fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>In July the court of cassation, Turkey\u2019s top appeals court, quashed the convictions of Altan and Ilicak but ruled that they should stay in prison and face the charge of \u201cdeliberately and willingly helping\u201d the G\u00fclen movement, which the regime deems to be a terrorist organisation. Altan and Ilicak deny the charges. The trial will begin on 8 October.</p> <p>Philippe Sands, the British/French human rights lawyer and writer who has taken the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg on the grounds that he is being held unlawfully, told the <em>Observer</em> he was \u201chorrified, frankly, at the failure of Britain\u201d to press for his release.</p> <p>\u201cWe need the government to be bellyaching loudly about this. Boris Johnson must publicly call on Erdo\u011fan to free Ahmet,\u201d said Sands, who wrote the preface to <em>I Will Never See the World Again</em>. \u201cAll they ever say is that they are working behind the scenes, but the only thing they care about is trade. It\u2019s an outrage.\u201d</p> <p>Sands, who is president of English PEN, which defends and promotes writers, awaits judgment from Strasbourg but has already successfully argued the case that Mehmet was imprisoned illegally.</p> <p>\u201cAhmet is such a remarkable individual, a man of real substance, a man of strength.

      "bodyText": "\u201cYou can imprison me but you cannot keep me here,\u201d writes Ahmet Altan at the end of his acclaimed book I Will Never See the World Again. \u201cBecause, like all writers, I have magic. I can pass through your walls with ease.\u201d The novelist\u2019s series of essays, smuggled out of jail among notes to his lawyers, was lauded by critics as an instant classic when it was published in Britain in spring this year, and last week it was longlisted for the \u00a350,000 Baillie Gifford nonfiction prize. Now Altan, who has been in jail for three years on charges arising from the failed Turkish coup attempt of July 2016, has expressed his defiance through the written word once again, writing another book from his shared cell in the high-security Silivri prison. \u201cI have written a new novel,\u201d he told the Observer via messages sent in and out of his prison cell. Like I Will Never See the World Again, the new title, Lady Life, is expected to be published in English first. A comedy set in today\u2019s Istanbul against a background of repression and political turmoil, its protagonist is a woman called Hayat, a word that means \u201clife\u201d in Turkish. \u201cIt tells the story of someone who doesn\u2019t take life too seriously,\u201d said Altan. \u201cShe turned out to be a character who amuses me greatly.\u201d According to Altan\u2019s friend Yasemin \u00c7ongar, who will translate the book into English, the novel is very funny. But always in the background is a broken society with an ailing economy, full of the \u201cnew poor\u201d, impoverished by a widespread and seemingly indiscriminate purge of so-called dissidents. \u201cThey are people whose lives have been interrupted, almost destroyed,\u201d said Congar. In the aftermath of the attempt to oust the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, more than 100,000 people \u2013 civil servants, teachers, judges, police officers, soldiers, journalists and academics \u2013 lost their jobs, most of them suspected of links to Fethullah G\u00fclen, a Turkish Islamic scholar exiled in the US who is accused by the authorities of masterminding the coup attempt. More than 300,000 books related \u2013 and unrelated \u2013 to G\u00fclen were destroyed; and the economy has slumped. Altan, 69, a combative, provocative and outspoken opponent of the Erdo\u011fan regime, was jailed in September 2016 pending trial, alongside his brother Mehmet, 66, a writer, journalist and academic, and a former MP and journalist Nazli Ilicak, 75, for allegedly sending \u201csubliminal messages\u201d on television in support of the coup. In February 2018, with Ilicak, Altan was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for attempting to overthrow the government. Mehmet was freed but lost his job as an economics professor. The sentence was greeted with outrage by writers worldwide, though an appeal to Erdo\u011fan for Ahmet Altan\u2019s release by 38 Nobel laureates \u2013 including VS Naipaul, JM Coetzee and Kazuo Ishiguro \u2013 fell on deaf ears. In July the court of cassation, Turkey\u2019s top appeals court, quashed the convictions of Altan and Ilicak but ruled that they should stay in prison and face the charge of \u201cdeliberately and willingly helping\u201d the G\u00fclen movement, which the regime deems to be a terrorist organisation. Altan and Ilicak deny the charges. The trial will begin on 8 October. Philippe Sands, the British/French human rights lawyer and writer who has taken the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg on the grounds that he is being held unlawfully, told the Observer he was \u201chorrified, frankly, at the failure of Britain\u201d to press for his release. \u201cWe need the government to be bellyaching loudly about this. Boris Johnson must publicly call on Erdo\u011fan to free Ahmet,\u201d said Sands, who wrote the preface to I Will Never See the World Again. \u201cAll they ever say is that they are working behind the scenes, but the only thing they care about is trade. It\u2019s an outrage.\u201d Sands, who is president of English PEN, which defends and promotes writers, awaits judgment from Strasbourg but has already successfully argued the case that Mehmet was imprisoned illegally. \u201cAhmet is such a remarkable individual, a man of real substance, a man of strength. And after all he has been through he remains unbowed and unbroken,\u201d said Sands. In the meantime Altan remains in the cell he shares with two other inmates in Silivri, a two-hour drive west of Istanbul on the Sea of Marmara. He writes while sitting on a plastic chair at a small plastic table, on paper bought from the prison commissary. His father \u00c7etin Altan, a prominent leftwing journalist, writer and MP, also published a novel (A Handful of Sky, 1974) while serving time as a political prisoner. Ahmet\u2019s wife, Gulnur, friends such as \u00c7ongar and supporters hope he will be released after the October trial. \u201cHe has been in jail too long already,\u201d said \u00c7ongar.

At least a further 450 people have been hospitalised for lung diseases related to vaping, with many complaining of shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, vomiting and fevers.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s position has itself sparked alarm among some health campaigners.</p> <p>\u201cIn the US every day, almost 2,500 children under 18 years of age try their first cigarette, more than 400 of them will become daily smokers,\u201d said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of <a href=\"https://ash.org.uk/home/\" title=\"\">Action on Smoking and Health</a>. \u201cHalf of all long-term smokers will ultimately die from smoking, amounting to 480,000 Americans a year. Children in the US commonly start by smoking menthol cigarettes, so why is the Trump administration leaving menthol cigarettes legal, while banning all flavours in e-cigarettes?\u201d</p> <p>Scientists from Yale and Duke universities have one answer. In 2018 they set out to establish whether the chemicals used to make the flavours \u2013 everything from creme brulee to mint \u2013 remained stable in e-cigarette liquids or underwent reactions.</p> <p>Their work was important. As the scientists explained in an introduction to the study, published in the journal <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ntr\" title=\"\"><em>Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research,</em> </a>\u201cvaping electronic cigarettes is increasingly popular with youth, driven by the wide range of available flavours\u201d.</p> <p>Although its findings were largely ignored outside scientific circles, the study is now being revisited given the events in the US, which have alarmed millions of parents. Today some 1.5 million teenagers use e-cigarettes in the US, something that prompted former head of the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/home\" title=\"\">Food and Drug Administration</a> Dr Scott Gottlieb to label the phenomenon an epidemic.</p> <p>Sven-Eric Jordt, one of <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-10/dumc-aft101518.php\" title=\"\">the authors of the 2018 flavours study</a>, told the <em>Observer</em> that their work had confirmed that \u201cthe liquids vaporised by e-cigarettes are chemically unstable and form new chemicals that irritate the airways and may have other toxic effects\u201d.</p> <p>E-cigarette liquids supposedly contain far fewer chemicals \u2013 as little as a handful \u2013 than traditional cigarettes and are therefore deemed safer. But the flavours study raises as many questions as it answers \u2013 not least how many chemicals are in e-cigarettes.</p> <p>Jordt continued: \u201cWe observed that these chemicals, when mixed during manufacturing, quickly undergo chemical reactions producing many more chemicals. For example, we observed that flavour chemicals (vanilla, fruit flavour) and the vapour carrier chemicals (propylene glycol, glycerin) react to produce chemicals named acetals.</p> <p>\u201cThis occurs at normal room temperature already, and we found that these compounds are enriched in the vapour and inhaled by users. This was unexpected and raised concerns since nothing is known about the inhalational safety of these compounds. In toxicological tests, we found that these compounds are strong irritants and we are currently researching whether they may harm cells in the lung.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e91bc5acd42287004fee1c3cbdb82d3befffe0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e91bc5acd42287004fee1c3cbdb82d3befffe0b/0_165_4617_2771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A vape shop in the US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The array of flavoured liquids sold by vape shops has been key to attracting e-cigarette smokers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ralston/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The flavours study, which found toxic levels of chemicals in some flavours, was just one of many published in the past two years that raised questions about the health risks associated with e-cigarettes.</p> <p>In the past three months, studies have suggested that exposure to nicotine-free e-cigarettes harms the <a href=\"https://tobacco.ucsf.edu/more-evidence-e-cigs-harm-cardiovascular-system-healthy-young-adults-%E2%80%93-and-it%E2%80%99s-not-nicotine\" title=\"\">cardiovascular system</a> of healthy young adults; that daily e-cigarette use is associated with increased risk of <a href=\"https://ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.012317\" title=\"\">myocardial infarction</a>; that vapour from e-cigarettes may impair<a href=\"https://www.news-medical.net/news/20190906/Vapor-from-e-cigarettes-may-impair-the-cells-that-line-the-lungs.aspx\" title=\"\"> the cells lining the lungs</a>; and that vaping may hamper the lungs\u2019 ability to <a href=\"https://www.krwg.org/post/new-study-reveals-how-vaping-hampers-bodys-infection-fighting-ability\" title=\"\">fend off infections</a>.</p> <p>But a plethora of reports have also made the case for vaping, especially when compared with the health risks associated with smoking. Many of these studies are funded by e-cigarette firms and should be viewed with caution, according to Elliott Reichardt, a research associate at the University of Calgary, who, in a report for <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/vaping-is-an-urgent-threat-to-public-health-112131\" title=\"\">the Conversation</a>, observed: \u201cIt is telling that studies published by the e-cigarette and tobacco industry are approximately 90 times more likely to find that e-cigarettes cause no harm than those published without such conflicts of interest.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s no wonder that vapers are confused.</p> <p>Outside a vape shop in central London last Wednesday, Eve explained that she started vaping in order to stop smoking. \u201cI generally feel better while vaping than smoking cigarettes,\u201d she said, adding that it was cheaper and did not leave a lingering smell. Now, though, she worries that she is vaping more than she would have originally smoked and has growing \u201cconcerns about its safety\u201d after reading recent reports.</p> <p>Harry said he had begun using e-cigarettes to replace smoking but gave them up after health concerns in the US made him think again: \u201cI started having some pain when breathing and I thought it is better to be safe and just stop.\u201d</p> <p>One of the shop\u2019s assistants insisted they had no worries about the safety of vaping. Another stressed: \u201cI\u2019d rather be vaping for five years than smoking for five years. If I wasn\u2019t vaping, I\u2019d be smoking and that\u2019s a lot more harmful.\u201d</p> <p>This is the line pushed by the industry in the UK as it seeks to distance itself from mounting concern in America where vaping, freed from heavy advertising restrictions, has been heavily marketed at young people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Electronic cigarettes are just as harmful as regular cigarettes, and any claim otherwise is equivalent to saying a heart attack is less harmful than cancer</p> <footer> <cite>Israel Cancer Association</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn the UK, we are proud to be a standard bearer for a consumer-driven industry which has already helped millions of people across the world stop smoking,\u201d said Dan Marchant, a spokesman for the UK Vaping Industry Association. \u201cWe will continue to work with the public health community in the UK to spread the facts about vaping, which Public Health England [PHE] continue to advise is 95% less harmful than smoking and is the most effective way for the UK\u2019s remaining seven million smokers to quit.\u201d</p> <p>The 95% claim was controversial when it was made in 2015. Not only were there concerns about how the figure was determined, but one of the authors of a crucial paper used to make it was a consultant to an e-cigarette distributor.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Professor John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco &amp; Alcohol Studies, supports the PHE position: \u201cPHE has promoted electronic cigarettes as a health reduction strategy. The most recent figures on children aged 11 to 16 show continued linear decline in smoking. Although people are experimenting with e-cigarettes, it\u2019s certainly not making them smokers.</p> <p>\u201cAdult rates are falling by around 0.9% per year on average \u2013 twice as fast as the US and about three times as fast as Australia, where electronic cigarettes are prohibited.</p> <p>\u201cIf you buy decent stuff from a reputable supplier we can\u2019t guarantee that it is safe but we can guarantee it\u2019s an awful lot safer than smoking. I think PHE has got it absolutely right and we should carry on like this.\u201d</p> <p>But Britton admits he has concerns about flavours.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the harm in vapour, it seems to me, comes from flavours. It would be reasonable to say \u2018let\u2019s have no flavours\u2019, but a lot of smokers say they can\u2019t tolerate inhaling straight nicotine vapour. For many vapers who were smokers, flavour is a key part of the success of moving on to vaping. I think there is a case for trying to limit the number of flavours available. There are thousands and thousands of them and I can\u2019t believe we need quite so many.\u201d</p> <p>But PHE\u2019s position on e-cigarettes is at odds with other countries\u2019 health authorities.</p> <p>\u201cElectronic cigarettes are just as harmful as regular cigarettes, and any claim otherwise is equivalent to the claim that a heart attack is less harmful than cancer,\u201d the Israel Cancer Association declared in July.</p> <p>India is pushing for a ban on e-cigarettes while Denmark\u2019s health authority said last week that everyone should avoid e-cigarettes, \u201cbut particularly children, youth and women who are pregnant or nursing\u201d.</p> <p>Respected transnational health bodies are also more vocal about their concerns. In May, the European Respiratory Society Tobacco Control Committee issued a <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-05-e-cigs-tobacco-products-smokers.html\" title=\"\">highly critical statement</a> about e-cigarettes headlined: \u201cE-cigs \u2026 are harmful and do not help smokers to quit\u201d.</p> <p>And back at home, PHE\u2019s position bewilders some health experts.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the tobacco control community is taking it [vaping] cautiously,\u201d said Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool. \u201cBut the UK is offering a bizarre national experiment. There is huge enthusiasm driven by clinicians who are dealing with patients crippled by bronchitis and cancer and who believe that anything that can get addicted smokers to stop is a good idea. The problem is that the evidence for cessation is not that good \u2013 it\u2019s no better than cold turkey or nicotine patches.\u201d</p> <p>Capewell, and Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, are two of the most vocal critics of PHE\u2019s position on e-cigarettes, regularly wading into a debate riven with acrimony.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What is the tobacco industry doing? Buying up electronic cigarette companies as fast as it can and pushing vaping very hard</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Simon Capewell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s all black and white, with no shades of grey,\u201d Capewell said. \u201cPeople like myself are accused of wanting to kill smokers, of ignoring the evidence.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the problem, Capewell believes, is that currently science lacks robust evidence: \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly new activity, so there is a shortage of information on long-term effectiveness and long-term harm.

      "bodyText": "In politically fractious times, vaping has achieved the impossible. It has morphed into a common enemy for those at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, pledged that his foundation will spend $160m fighting youth vaping, while Donald Trump has unveiled plans for a ban on flavoured e-cigarettes to protect, as he put it, \u201cinnocent children\u201d. The president\u2019s announcement came after the deaths of six people in the US who had used vape pens and e-cigarettes. At least a further 450 people have been hospitalised for lung diseases related to vaping, with many complaining of shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, vomiting and fevers. But Trump\u2019s position has itself sparked alarm among some health campaigners. \u201cIn the US every day, almost 2,500 children under 18 years of age try their first cigarette, more than 400 of them will become daily smokers,\u201d said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health. \u201cHalf of all long-term smokers will ultimately die from smoking, amounting to 480,000 Americans a year. Children in the US commonly start by smoking menthol cigarettes, so why is the Trump administration leaving menthol cigarettes legal, while banning all flavours in e-cigarettes?\u201d Scientists from Yale and Duke universities have one answer. In 2018 they set out to establish whether the chemicals used to make the flavours \u2013 everything from creme brulee to mint \u2013 remained stable in e-cigarette liquids or underwent reactions. Their work was important. As the scientists explained in an introduction to the study, published in the journal Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research, \u201cvaping electronic cigarettes is increasingly popular with youth, driven by the wide range of available flavours\u201d. Although its findings were largely ignored outside scientific circles, the study is now being revisited given the events in the US, which have alarmed millions of parents. Today some 1.5 million teenagers use e-cigarettes in the US, something that prompted former head of the Food and Drug Administration Dr Scott Gottlieb to label the phenomenon an epidemic. Sven-Eric Jordt, one of the authors of the 2018 flavours study, told the Observer that their work had confirmed that \u201cthe liquids vaporised by e-cigarettes are chemically unstable and form new chemicals that irritate the airways and may have other toxic effects\u201d. E-cigarette liquids supposedly contain far fewer chemicals \u2013 as little as a handful \u2013 than traditional cigarettes and are therefore deemed safer. But the flavours study raises as many questions as it answers \u2013 not least how many chemicals are in e-cigarettes. Jordt continued: \u201cWe observed that these chemicals, when mixed during manufacturing, quickly undergo chemical reactions producing many more chemicals. For example, we observed that flavour chemicals (vanilla, fruit flavour) and the vapour carrier chemicals (propylene glycol, glycerin) react to produce chemicals named acetals. \u201cThis occurs at normal room temperature already, and we found that these compounds are enriched in the vapour and inhaled by users. This was unexpected and raised concerns since nothing is known about the inhalational safety of these compounds. In toxicological tests, we found that these compounds are strong irritants and we are currently researching whether they may harm cells in the lung.\u201d The flavours study, which found toxic levels of chemicals in some flavours, was just one of many published in the past two years that raised questions about the health risks associated with e-cigarettes. In the past three months, studies have suggested that exposure to nicotine-free e-cigarettes harms the cardiovascular system of healthy young adults; that daily e-cigarette use is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction; that vapour from e-cigarettes may impair the cells lining the lungs; and that vaping may hamper the lungs\u2019 ability to fend off infections. But a plethora of reports have also made the case for vaping, especially when compared with the health risks associated with smoking. Many of these studies are funded by e-cigarette firms and should be viewed with caution, according to Elliott Reichardt, a research associate at the University of Calgary, who, in a report for the Conversation, observed: \u201cIt is telling that studies published by the e-cigarette and tobacco industry are approximately 90 times more likely to find that e-cigarettes cause no harm than those published without such conflicts of interest.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder that vapers are confused. Outside a vape shop in central London last Wednesday, Eve explained that she started vaping in order to stop smoking. \u201cI generally feel better while vaping than smoking cigarettes,\u201d she said, adding that it was cheaper and did not leave a lingering smell. Now, though, she worries that she is vaping more than she would have originally smoked and has growing \u201cconcerns about its safety\u201d after reading recent reports. Harry said he had begun using e-cigarettes to replace smoking but gave them up after health concerns in the US made him think again: \u201cI started having some pain when breathing and I thought it is better to be safe and just stop.\u201d One of the shop\u2019s assistants insisted they had no worries about the safety of vaping. Another stressed: \u201cI\u2019d rather be vaping for five years than smoking for five years. If I wasn\u2019t vaping, I\u2019d be smoking and that\u2019s a lot more harmful.\u201d This is the line pushed by the industry in the UK as it seeks to distance itself from mounting concern in America where vaping, freed from heavy advertising restrictions, has been heavily marketed at young people. \u201cIn the UK, we are proud to be a standard bearer for a consumer-driven industry which has already helped millions of people across the world stop smoking,\u201d said Dan Marchant, a spokesman for the UK Vaping Industry Association. \u201cWe will continue to work with the public health community in the UK to spread the facts about vaping, which Public Health England [PHE] continue to advise is 95% less harmful than smoking and is the most effective way for the UK\u2019s remaining seven million smokers to quit.\u201d The 95% claim was controversial when it was made in 2015. Not only were there concerns about how the figure was determined, but one of the authors of a crucial paper used to make it was a consultant to an e-cigarette distributor. Nevertheless, Professor John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco &amp; Alcohol Studies, supports the PHE position: \u201cPHE has promoted electronic cigarettes as a health reduction strategy. The most recent figures on children aged 11 to 16 show continued linear decline in smoking. Although people are experimenting with e-cigarettes, it\u2019s certainly not making them smokers. \u201cAdult rates are falling by around 0.9% per year on average \u2013 twice as fast as the US and about three times as fast as Australia, where electronic cigarettes are prohibited. \u201cIf you buy decent stuff from a reputable supplier we can\u2019t guarantee that it is safe but we can guarantee it\u2019s an awful lot safer than smoking. I think PHE has got it absolutely right and we should carry on like this.\u201d But Britton admits he has concerns about flavours. \u201cMost of the harm in vapour, it seems to me, comes from flavours. It would be reasonable to say \u2018let\u2019s have no flavours\u2019, but a lot of smokers say they can\u2019t tolerate inhaling straight nicotine vapour. For many vapers who were smokers, flavour is a key part of the success of moving on to vaping. I think there is a case for trying to limit the number of flavours available. There are thousands and thousands of them and I can\u2019t believe we need quite so many.\u201d But PHE\u2019s position on e-cigarettes is at odds with other countries\u2019 health authorities. \u201cElectronic cigarettes are just as harmful as regular cigarettes, and any claim otherwise is equivalent to the claim that a heart attack is less harmful than cancer,\u201d the Israel Cancer Association declared in July. India is pushing for a ban on e-cigarettes while Denmark\u2019s health authority said last week that everyone should avoid e-cigarettes, \u201cbut particularly children, youth and women who are pregnant or nursing\u201d. Respected transnational health bodies are also more vocal about their concerns. In May, the European Respiratory Society Tobacco Control Committee issued a highly critical statement about e-cigarettes headlined: \u201cE-cigs \u2026 are harmful and do not help smokers to quit\u201d. And back at home, PHE\u2019s position bewilders some health experts. \u201cMost of the tobacco control community is taking it [vaping] cautiously,\u201d said Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool. \u201cBut the UK is offering a bizarre national experiment. There is huge enthusiasm driven by clinicians who are dealing with patients crippled by bronchitis and cancer and who believe that anything that can get addicted smokers to stop is a good idea. The problem is that the evidence for cessation is not that good \u2013 it\u2019s no better than cold turkey or nicotine patches.\u201d Capewell, and Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, are two of the most vocal critics of PHE\u2019s position on e-cigarettes, regularly wading into a debate riven with acrimony. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s all black and white, with no shades of grey,\u201d Capewell said. \u201cPeople like myself are accused of wanting to kill smokers, of ignoring the evidence.\u201d Part of the problem, Capewell believes, is that currently science lacks robust evidence: \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly new activity, so there is a shortage of information on long-term effectiveness and long-term harm. In the public health world, in that situation we normally adopt a cautionary principle. This has been learned the hard way with the magic insulation material called asbestos and the magic drug for feeling sick when pregnant that was Thalidomide.\u201d But fears that the UK is storing up problems for the future by fostering a US-style teen vaping epidemic are misplaced, according to Arnott. \u201cThe 2019 Ash survey finds that in the UK youth vaping is nowhere near epidemic levels, with regular vaping remaining rare, and that young people vape mainly just to give it a try, not because they like the flavours or think it\u2019s cool.\u201d And yet even the most recent Ash survey found that the percentage of 11- to 18-year-olds who are vaping increased from 3.4% in 2018 to almost 5% in 2019. Admittedly, these were occasional vapers, but the entrance to the UK of the American e-cigarette brand Juul in 2018 \u2013 whose sleek and shiny products, complete with USB charging ports, have been compared to iPods \u2013 threatens to be a game-changer. Juul is huge in the US where the company finds itself in the invidious position of being prosecuted by the state of North Carolina and subject to a congressional committee investigation. In court documents outlining the case against Juul, North Carolina observes that e-cigarette usage between 2017 and 2018 increased by 78% among US high school pupils and claims: \u201cJuul has played a central role in fostering the epidemic of e-cigarette use among youth.

      "body": "<p>In 1991, 17-year-old Alex Lockwood was flipping through the <em>Guardian Weekend</em> magazine in his family\u2019s car, en route to a family Sunday roast, when he spotted an image that changed his life. A harpooned whale, its body bloodied and lifeless, drew him to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/jun/24/whaling.observerfocus\" title=\"\">feature </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/jun/24/whaling.observerfocus\" title=\"\">about </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/jun/24/whaling.observerfocus\" title=\"\">its killing</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThat picture just shook me; it seemed so wrong. When I got to my nan\u2019s house it hit me that the roast on the table was an animal that had also been killed.\u201d He became vegetarian, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/veganism\" title=\"\">vegan</a>, and nearly three decades later is one of the founding members of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/14/dozens-arrested-as-extinction-rebellion-protesters-blockade-melbourne-bridge\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a>\u2019s new sister organisation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/16/animal-rebellion-extinction-activists-to-blockade-smithfield-meat-market-environment\" title=\"\">Animal Rebellion</a>, which formed in June and plans to blockade London\u2019s Smithfield Market \u2013 Britain\u2019s largest meat distribution market \u2013 in October.</p> <p>For almost a year Extinction Rebellion has made the headlines with its use of civil disobedience to pressure governments and corporations to act on the climate crisis, prompting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/01/declare-formal-climate-emergency-before-its-too-late-corbyn-warns\" title=\"\">MPs to pass a motion declaring a climate emergency in May</a>. Inspired by its success, Animal Rebellion has set its sights on making Britain\u2019s food system plant-based. While the group believes the meat and dairy industry is inherently cruel, the focus is predominantly on the environmental arguments. Lockwood, now a senior lecturer focusing on vegan and environmental issues at the University of Sunderland, says: \u201cWe can\u2019t fix the climate emergency without ending the animal agriculture industry.\u201d</p> <p>Veganism as a solution to the climate crisis has become a key discussion point in recent months. Amid record-breaking temperatures over the summer, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/03/ipcc-land-use-food-production-key-to-climate-crisis-leaked-report\" title=\"\">proposed a major shift towards plant-based diets</a>, warning that it will be impossible to avert climate catastrophe by reducing carbon emissions from manufacturing, power plants and transport alone. As thousands of fires blazed in the Amazon rainforest in August \u2013 many of them started to clear land for cattle rearing \u2013 and released huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, calls for boycotts of beef and other animal products grew louder. Animal agriculture accounts for 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization, more than all transportation combined.</p> <p>Animal Rebellion wants everyone to go vegan \u2013 but, like Extinction Rebellion, its main goal is system change rather than telling individuals to change habits. Tomorrow about 50 activists from the group plan to stage a \u201creforestation\u201d protest in Parliament Square: armed with spades, they aim to plant a two-metre-high walnut tree there, as well as dozens of seedlings, though they aren\u2019t sure how far they will get before police make arrests.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we need the government to act to stop deforestation,\u201d says Simone Scampoli, Animal Rebellion\u2019s action team coordinator. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen images of the Amazon on fire, but deforestation is happening all over the world to rear animals and grow crops to feed them. We know trees are essential for absorbing the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming.\u201d</p> <p>Tomorrow\u2019s protest is also a practice run of civil disobedience for the Smithfield Market blockade, which will be part of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s next \u201cmovement of movements\u201d, International Rebellion, encompassing other groups, starting 7 October. About 2,000 volunteers are signed up to take part in the blockade, set to begin with a training session at an undisclosed location, before they march to the market ahead of its opening for business at about 11pm. Protesters will camp in front of the market overnight and aim to hold on to the site for two weeks, blocking vans and lorries from entering. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be lively and joyous, with singing, dancing, a boat, lots of fruit and veg stalls, a festival atmosphere,\u201d Lockwood says. \u201cWe want to turn Smithfield Market into Britain\u2019s most vibrant and colourful fruit and vegetable market.\u201d</p> <p>Animal Rebellion says it has received messages on social media threatening violence if they go ahead with the protest. \u201cWe\u2019re a peaceful, non-violent group and we\u2019re all quite scared about that,\u201d Lockwood admits. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to cause trouble or hurt people\u2019s livelihoods. But Smithfield is the symbolic seat of the UK meat industry, which is driving climate change, and if we carry on our current trajectory there won\u2019t be any jobs left.\u201d</p> <p>To many, Animal Rebellion\u2019s goal of ending animal agriculture may seem unthinkable \u2013 much of the current debate revolves around reducing meat and dairy rather than cutting it completely. Commenting on Animal Rebellion\u2019s planned protest, a spokesperson for the National Farmers Union said: \u201cFarmers take the issue of climate change extremely seriously, which is why we have set our own target to be <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/nfu-online/news/the-future-of-food-2040/\" title=\"\">net zero by 2040</a>. We believe British livestock has a crucial role to play in achieving our ambition. Our extensive grass-fed system means British farmers produce some of the most climate-friendly meat in the world.

      "bodyText": "In 1991, 17-year-old Alex Lockwood was flipping through the Guardian Weekend magazine in his family\u2019s car, en route to a family Sunday roast, when he spotted an image that changed his life. A harpooned whale, its body bloodied and lifeless, drew him to a feature about its killing. \u201cThat picture just shook me; it seemed so wrong. When I got to my nan\u2019s house it hit me that the roast on the table was an animal that had also been killed.\u201d He became vegetarian, then vegan, and nearly three decades later is one of the founding members of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s new sister organisation, Animal Rebellion, which formed in June and plans to blockade London\u2019s Smithfield Market \u2013 Britain\u2019s largest meat distribution market \u2013 in October. For almost a year Extinction Rebellion has made the headlines with its use of civil disobedience to pressure governments and corporations to act on the climate crisis, prompting MPs to pass a motion declaring a climate emergency in May. Inspired by its success, Animal Rebellion has set its sights on making Britain\u2019s food system plant-based. While the group believes the meat and dairy industry is inherently cruel, the focus is predominantly on the environmental arguments. Lockwood, now a senior lecturer focusing on vegan and environmental issues at the University of Sunderland, says: \u201cWe can\u2019t fix the climate emergency without ending the animal agriculture industry.\u201d Veganism as a solution to the climate crisis has become a key discussion point in recent months. Amid record-breaking temperatures over the summer, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) proposed a major shift towards plant-based diets, warning that it will be impossible to avert climate catastrophe by reducing carbon emissions from manufacturing, power plants and transport alone. As thousands of fires blazed in the Amazon rainforest in August \u2013 many of them started to clear land for cattle rearing \u2013 and released huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, calls for boycotts of beef and other animal products grew louder. Animal agriculture accounts for 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization, more than all transportation combined. Animal Rebellion wants everyone to go vegan \u2013 but, like Extinction Rebellion, its main goal is system change rather than telling individuals to change habits. Tomorrow about 50 activists from the group plan to stage a \u201creforestation\u201d protest in Parliament Square: armed with spades, they aim to plant a two-metre-high walnut tree there, as well as dozens of seedlings, though they aren\u2019t sure how far they will get before police make arrests. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we need the government to act to stop deforestation,\u201d says Simone Scampoli, Animal Rebellion\u2019s action team coordinator. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen images of the Amazon on fire, but deforestation is happening all over the world to rear animals and grow crops to feed them. We know trees are essential for absorbing the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming.\u201d Tomorrow\u2019s protest is also a practice run of civil disobedience for the Smithfield Market blockade, which will be part of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s next \u201cmovement of movements\u201d, International Rebellion, encompassing other groups, starting 7 October. About 2,000 volunteers are signed up to take part in the blockade, set to begin with a training session at an undisclosed location, before they march to the market ahead of its opening for business at about 11pm. Protesters will camp in front of the market overnight and aim to hold on to the site for two weeks, blocking vans and lorries from entering. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be lively and joyous, with singing, dancing, a boat, lots of fruit and veg stalls, a festival atmosphere,\u201d Lockwood says. \u201cWe want to turn Smithfield Market into Britain\u2019s most vibrant and colourful fruit and vegetable market.\u201d Animal Rebellion says it has received messages on social media threatening violence if they go ahead with the protest. \u201cWe\u2019re a peaceful, non-violent group and we\u2019re all quite scared about that,\u201d Lockwood admits. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to cause trouble or hurt people\u2019s livelihoods. But Smithfield is the symbolic seat of the UK meat industry, which is driving climate change, and if we carry on our current trajectory there won\u2019t be any jobs left.\u201d To many, Animal Rebellion\u2019s goal of ending animal agriculture may seem unthinkable \u2013 much of the current debate revolves around reducing meat and dairy rather than cutting it completely. Commenting on Animal Rebellion\u2019s planned protest, a spokesperson for the National Farmers Union said: \u201cFarmers take the issue of climate change extremely seriously, which is why we have set our own target to be net zero by 2040. We believe British livestock has a crucial role to play in achieving our ambition. Our extensive grass-fed system means British farmers produce some of the most climate-friendly meat in the world. It is already 2.5 times more efficient than the global average.\u201d Lockwood says that the 2040 goal is too late and relies on technology that has not yet been developed. Also commenting on the protest, James Tumbridge, chairman of the City of London Corporation\u2019s markets committee, which includes Smithfield Market, said: \u201cWe will work positively with any protesters to allow peaceful demonstration, but our first aim must be the uninterrupted safe operation of the market. The intended protest is potentially very damaging to the workers at Smithfield Market. The men and women who work there are vital to feeding London, and we have a duty to protect their livelihoods and the food supply.\u201dAnimal Rebellion has been trying to engage Smithfield Market in dialogue, Lockwood says. \u201cWe recognise that butchers and meat industry workers have a deep pride in feeding the nation,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe want them to carry on feeding people, but with plant-based food, in a way that\u2019s sustainable and just.\u201d Who are Animal Rebellion? Founded by around 12 people in June, including Dr Alex Lockwood (44), Dan Kidby, animal rights activist and the core founder of Animal Think Tank, Dilan Fernando, a 25-year-old from Australia who left his banking job to focus on organising social movements, and Esther Salomon (19), who has deferred starting her politics degree at Edinburgh University to work for Animal Rebellion full-time. How big is the group? Around 100 organisers, with 2,000 volunteers signed up for the Smithfield protest next month. What are its aims? To get the government to tell the truth about the climate emergency, reduce greenhouse gases to net zero by 2025, and set up a citizens\u2019 assembly. Also to start a debate on switching to a plant-based food system.",

She and the director, John Crowley, have created a new theatrical babel to reflect the wildness and unlikeliness of what is going on: <strong>A Very Expensive Poison</strong> lurches from one mood and one form to another. Tom Scutt\u2019s frighteningly fertile design alternately shrinks and blows open the stage, swerving from naturalism to grandiose fantasy. Here is a dingy yellowish Russian flat, a massive triumphalist golden arch, a plain hospital bed in which Tom Brooke\u2019s arresting, elusive Litvinenko sits propped up, as in his familiar news photograph. Most famous when the cause of his plight was most buried.</p> <p>Swerving in and out of reality has been a recurring concern of Prebble\u2019s plays: it is her true subject and it is what makes her so truly theatrical. In <em>Enron</em> she put the digital and the fleshy side by side; in <em>The Effect</em> she put on stage manufactured emotion. Here she can make an audience think it has swallowed Alice\u2019s delusion-inducing potion. Scale and mood flip from moment to moment. From scenes fuelled by toxic masculinity to scenes commandeered by the determination of Marina Litvinenko, for whom this is a love story and a tragedy.</p> <p>MyAnna Buring barely allows a tremor in her voice: she is controlled, determined and graceful \u2013 like the dancer this widow was; as her husband\u2019s hair starts to fall out from the effects of radiation, she calmly collects it in a plastic hospital cup. Around her is the scarcely human, the fabricated and the farcical. Bungling operatives leave their poison in a hotel room. Reece Shearsmith\u2019s creamy, chilling Putin steals all over the theatre like a lethal gas; Peter Polycarpou\u2019s oligarch bursts into jovial song. A professor takes us calmly through a shadow play about nuclear reactors called Ruslan and Ludymila. Giant puppets of Yeltsin and Brezhnev wander through an apartment, escapees from an axed satirical TV show. In one of the boldest strokes Michael Shaeffer finely delivers a speech about Soviet deaths in the second world war and the effects of shame: it comes just as you think your capacity for sympathy has evaporated. And just when you might think there are too many theatrical swivellings, Buring steps off the stage into the audience. Of course that is another swivel. But that is part of the point.

      "body": "<p>\u201cEver been to Pleasure Island?\u201d asks Lampwick, the rowdy, doomed delinquent from Disney\u2019s <em>Pinocchio</em>, as the stagecoach spirits a cargo of children through the darkened streets and clear out of the world. At Pleasure Island, behind high, bolted gates, the town\u2019s tearaways are promised a life free from societal interference. They can drink and smoke and shoot pool at their leisure, blissfully unaware that the theme park is, in fact, a nightmarish factory or sulphurous processing plant. Come daybreak they will have been transformed into donkeys, herded into crates and put to work in the mines.</p> <p>Misguided or not, the kids in <em>Pinocchio</em> are at least clamouring to visit Pleasure Island, which is more than can be said for the pint-sized inmates of Stephen King\u2019s meaty, satisfying slab of high-concept pulp fiction. Instead, its inhabitants are forcibly abducted from their homes at night and installed as laboratory rats by a shadowy government organisation. They\u2019re plied with cigarettes and alcohol. They\u2019re being slowly fattened for the kill. And if <em>The Institute</em> finally lacks the pure jolting terror of Lampwick\u2019s transformation into a jackass, it compensates with an atmosphere of creeping dread and a keen awareness of the cogs and wheels of bureaucratic evil. King\u2019s villains, it transpires, are a bunch of middle-management automatons, headhunted from the US military or plucked from well-paid careers at Halliburton. These people wouldn\u2019t consider themselves to be sadists, exactly. They\u2019re simply clocking in and out, following orders and processing kids.</p> <p>The latest lamb to the slaughter is 12-year-old Luke Ellis, a child prodigy with mild telekinetic powers who awakens one morning at a cinder-block compound in the backwoods of Maine. Ellis and his fellow prisoners (some telekinetic, some telepathic) are here to be weaponised \u2013 made over as \u201cpsychic drones\u201d to be deployed in an opaque geopolitical struggle. Mrs Sigsby, the compound\u2019s icy boss, insists that the children view themselves as American heroes. But once they\u2019ve been sent into battle, the evidence suggests that they\u2019re not meant to come home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/07/stephen-king-interview-the-institute\">Stephen King: \u2018I have outlived most of my critics. It gives me great pleasure\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In casting about to get their bearings, the Institute\u2019s inmates helpfully reference Pleasure Island and the witch\u2019s cage from <em>Hansel and Gretel</em>. They might also have cited Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s <em>Never Let Me Go</em>, another dystopian tale of battery-farmed children. Hell, while they\u2019re about it, they might even namecheck some previous Stephen King publications \u2013 specifically <em>Firestarter</em>, <em>The Shining</em>, <em>Dreamcatcher</em> and <em>Carrie</em>. After more than 50 profitable years in the business, the author has long since hit the point where he\u2019s circling back on himself, revisiting themes he\u2019s covered in the past (in this case supernatural children and a mammoth dark-state conspiracy). The success of <em>The Institute</em>, though, is in the way it repurposes this familiar material to spotlight a 21st-century US in crisis; corrupted and compromised and mired in debt. The Institute sits alone in the woods. But it\u2019s symptomatic of a wider malaise.</p> <p>No doubt this is why, midway through the tale, King conspires to send the imperilled Ellis under the fence and back into the world. The kid rafts downriver like Huck Finn, hides out on a boxcar like a hobo and eventually alights in an impoverished backwater burgh in the south. The small town, of course, remains King\u2019s natural wheelhouse, his happy hunting ground, an abiding preoccupation alongside kids with supernatural powers. DuPray, South Carolina, contains a freight yard, a Waffle House and a convenience store that\u2019s managed by two Somalian brothers. There is a depressed barber who sits out on his front porch every night, and a struggling motel owner who\u2019s not entirely to be trusted. Every household owns a gun. Every resident has too much time on their hands. DuPray, in other words, is the nation in microcosm, perched at a crossroads, torn between its best and worst impulses. The runaway child needs a shelter. Mrs Sigsby\u2019s goons are on their way. On sleepy Main Street, outside the sheriff\u2019s office, one has the sense of America weighing up its options and deciding which way it should jump.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Institute</em> by Stephen King is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "\u201cEver been to Pleasure Island?\u201d asks Lampwick, the rowdy, doomed delinquent from Disney\u2019s Pinocchio, as the stagecoach spirits a cargo of children through the darkened streets and clear out of the world. At Pleasure Island, behind high, bolted gates, the town\u2019s tearaways are promised a life free from societal interference. They can drink and smoke and shoot pool at their leisure, blissfully unaware that the theme park is, in fact, a nightmarish factory or sulphurous processing plant. Come daybreak they will have been transformed into donkeys, herded into crates and put to work in the mines. Misguided or not, the kids in Pinocchio are at least clamouring to visit Pleasure Island, which is more than can be said for the pint-sized inmates of Stephen King\u2019s meaty, satisfying slab of high-concept pulp fiction. Instead, its inhabitants are forcibly abducted from their homes at night and installed as laboratory rats by a shadowy government organisation. They\u2019re plied with cigarettes and alcohol. They\u2019re being slowly fattened for the kill. And if The Institute finally lacks the pure jolting terror of Lampwick\u2019s transformation into a jackass, it compensates with an atmosphere of creeping dread and a keen awareness of the cogs and wheels of bureaucratic evil. King\u2019s villains, it transpires, are a bunch of middle-management automatons, headhunted from the US military or plucked from well-paid careers at Halliburton. These people wouldn\u2019t consider themselves to be sadists, exactly. They\u2019re simply clocking in and out, following orders and processing kids. The latest lamb to the slaughter is 12-year-old Luke Ellis, a child prodigy with mild telekinetic powers who awakens one morning at a cinder-block compound in the backwoods of Maine. Ellis and his fellow prisoners (some telekinetic, some telepathic) are here to be weaponised \u2013 made over as \u201cpsychic drones\u201d to be deployed in an opaque geopolitical struggle. Mrs Sigsby, the compound\u2019s icy boss, insists that the children view themselves as American heroes. But once they\u2019ve been sent into battle, the evidence suggests that they\u2019re not meant to come home. In casting about to get their bearings, the Institute\u2019s inmates helpfully reference Pleasure Island and the witch\u2019s cage from Hansel and Gretel. They might also have cited Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s Never Let Me Go, another dystopian tale of battery-farmed children. Hell, while they\u2019re about it, they might even namecheck some previous Stephen King publications \u2013 specifically Firestarter, The Shining, Dreamcatcher and Carrie. After more than 50 profitable years in the business, the author has long since hit the point where he\u2019s circling back on himself, revisiting themes he\u2019s covered in the past (in this case supernatural children and a mammoth dark-state conspiracy). The success of The Institute, though, is in the way it repurposes this familiar material to spotlight a 21st-century US in crisis; corrupted and compromised and mired in debt. The Institute sits alone in the woods. But it\u2019s symptomatic of a wider malaise. No doubt this is why, midway through the tale, King conspires to send the imperilled Ellis under the fence and back into the world. The kid rafts downriver like Huck Finn, hides out on a boxcar like a hobo and eventually alights in an impoverished backwater burgh in the south. The small town, of course, remains King\u2019s natural wheelhouse, his happy hunting ground, an abiding preoccupation alongside kids with supernatural powers. DuPray, South Carolina, contains a freight yard, a Waffle House and a convenience store that\u2019s managed by two Somalian brothers. There is a depressed barber who sits out on his front porch every night, and a struggling motel owner who\u2019s not entirely to be trusted. Every household owns a gun. Every resident has too much time on their hands. DuPray, in other words, is the nation in microcosm, perched at a crossroads, torn between its best and worst impulses. The runaway child needs a shelter. Mrs Sigsby\u2019s goons are on their way. On sleepy Main Street, outside the sheriff\u2019s office, one has the sense of America weighing up its options and deciding which way it should jump. \u2022 The Institute by Stephen King is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00a320).

Recent research from Parent Zone found that 93% of 10-to-16-year-olds in the UK regularly play computer games; for boys, it\u2019s 97%. <a href=\"https://parentzone.org.uk/system/files/attachments/The%20Ripoff%20Games%20-%20Parent%20Zone%20report.pdf\" title=\"\">The Rip-Off Games</a>, of which I was a co-author, reported that three-quarters of those children believe online video games try to make them spend as much money as possible while they are playing; almost half (49%) think online games are only fun when they do spend.</p> <p>Over the past 10 years, the business model of gaming has changed. What we once called computer games were bought, complete, on a disk. The advent of cloud computing allowed for software updates downloaded in the course of play \u2013 and for getting gamers to pay for them. Modern games are no longer products you buy and use \u2013 they have become a gateway to perpetual spending opportunities.</p> <p>In-game transactions and microtransactions take various forms: new playable content, currency or cosmetic alterations to the appearance of characters or weapons (known as skins). These may affect play, avoiding \u201cgrind\u201d (seasoned gamers sometimes talk disparagingly of \u201cpay to win\u201d).</p> <p>Sophisticated behaviour-manipulation techniques borrowed from the gambling industry and elsewhere on the internet are deployed to incentivise spending. These include the use of in-game currency to make transactions impenetrable; loss-aversion (people are more likely to spend money if they are only one or two steps away from winning); reward-removal, where players are given a reward and threatened with its being taken away; \u201cfun pain\u201d, where a pop-up, say, offers a way out of a painful situation; and time-limited offers, delivered at a point of high tension.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For an insecure child, a cosmetic item that represents social cachet matters that much more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Adults also play online games, but since almost all children are gamers, the general principle that children are entitled to a greater degree of protection from exploitative commercialism ought to prevail.

      "bodyText": "Last week, MPs called on the government to classify online loot boxes as gambling and in the process highlighted a scandal: the $137.9bn (\u00a3110bn) gaming industry makes much of its profit by ripping off children. Young people are being nudged, enticed and coerced not only to carry on playing but also paying. Loot boxes \u2013 mystery objects in virtual treasure chests that players pay to open \u2013 resemble nothing so much as a lottery. Gamers spent $30bn on them worldwide in 2018, a figure that has been predicted to rise to $50bn in the next five years. Countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and China have already either classified loot boxes as gambling or moved to restrict them. Several academic studies have found an overlap between loot boxes and problem gambling. The digital, culture, media and sport committee was right to urge the government to take precautions, certainly until more is understood about the relationship between this aspect of gaming and gambling. Loot boxes, though, are simply the most egregious example of a pernicious business model that is exploiting most of Britain\u2019s children. Recent research from Parent Zone found that 93% of 10-to-16-year-olds in the UK regularly play computer games; for boys, it\u2019s 97%. The Rip-Off Games, of which I was a co-author, reported that three-quarters of those children believe online video games try to make them spend as much money as possible while they are playing; almost half (49%) think online games are only fun when they do spend. Over the past 10 years, the business model of gaming has changed. What we once called computer games were bought, complete, on a disk. The advent of cloud computing allowed for software updates downloaded in the course of play \u2013 and for getting gamers to pay for them. Modern games are no longer products you buy and use \u2013 they have become a gateway to perpetual spending opportunities. In-game transactions and microtransactions take various forms: new playable content, currency or cosmetic alterations to the appearance of characters or weapons (known as skins). These may affect play, avoiding \u201cgrind\u201d (seasoned gamers sometimes talk disparagingly of \u201cpay to win\u201d). Sophisticated behaviour-manipulation techniques borrowed from the gambling industry and elsewhere on the internet are deployed to incentivise spending. These include the use of in-game currency to make transactions impenetrable; loss-aversion (people are more likely to spend money if they are only one or two steps away from winning); reward-removal, where players are given a reward and threatened with its being taken away; \u201cfun pain\u201d, where a pop-up, say, offers a way out of a painful situation; and time-limited offers, delivered at a point of high tension. Adults also play online games, but since almost all children are gamers, the general principle that children are entitled to a greater degree of protection from exploitative commercialism ought to prevail. Parent Zone\u2019s research found dissatisfaction among adult gamers about the way that games were released piecemeal, in need of updates, or designed to require last-minute spending to complete. Older gamers were, on the whole, less impressed by skins, often preferring to play old, classic games or to put up with grind. Most young people we spoke to knew someone who had spent too much \u2013 in some cases, hundreds of pounds of birthday money \u2013 and these children often tended to be younger or more vulnerable. For an insecure child, a cosmetic item that represents social cachet matters that much more. No one is suggesting that games developers and publishers should not be rewarded for their creativity and enterprise. The games industry is hugely important to the UK economy. But the current business model is unsustainable. Rumblings of dissatisfaction from older gamers have been followed by a belated and half-hearted attempt by games companies to put their house in order: in August, Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft announced that they would require publishers releasing games on their consoles to disclose the drop rate of loot boxes. The predatory business model of gaming may ultimately be self-defeating. But, in the meantime, it presents the possibility that the most vulnerable children will be subject to the strongest inducements and dark nudges. Gaming\u2019s positive aspects are not in doubt: gaming is fun, exciting and social. It fosters skills and forges friendships. Currently, though, the gaming industry relies for its profits on the manipulation and exploitation of children. \u2022 Geraldine Bedell is executive editor of Parent Zone",

Mostly, you imagine, like many of us who have experienced that midlife milestone, the show would ideally like to take to its bed in a darkened room to fret about its blood pressure and its sell-by date, and to relive those golden years before any red-faced audience member ever yelled the words \u201cno deal\u201d or \u201cconfirmatory vote\u201d or \u201cthe Irish backstop\u201d.</p> \n<p>For those who hold to the idea that politics and journalism should be more about listening than lecturing, more about informed doubt than angry certainty, <em>Question Time</em> has for a long while been an uncomfortable watch. Since the redoubtable charmer David Dimbleby finally threw in the towel after 25 years, aged 80, in December, the hottest seat in British broadcasting has belonged to Fiona Bruce, who maintains a measure of order with a mixture of good humour and exasperation and that judiciously raised eyebrow. Her early outings on the show were praised for their briskness and confidence. As this long year has worn on, however, she has, like the rest of us, looked a little more beleaguered. She was not 20 minutes into the first show after the summer break before she was calling a time-out to the partisan bickering: \u201cWe are better than this.\u201d Most evidence in the current public square suggests that we are not.</p> \n<p>I met her last Monday, at the same moment that her equivalent in the House of Commons, John Bercow, was announcing his departure. She had been instrumental, the week before, in bringing back <em>Question Time</em> earlier than scheduled \u201cbecause we all felt it was important for people to be able to hold their elected representatives to account in the absence of parliament\u201d. Was there a part of her that wished she had stuck to <em>Fake </em><em>Or Fortune?</em>, <em>The Antiques Roadshow</em> and the news?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cefafa39-4b99-49a1-b081-b34cfe92684d\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(September 13, 1979)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The first episode of <i>Question Time</i> is broadcast on BBC One on 25 September, hosted by Robin Day.

But I tell myself a) times will not always be this fraught, and b) I will get more used to it. So it won\u2019t always be like this.\u201d</p> \n<p>I wish I shared her confidence. That first week back she gave in to the inevitable and the audience talked Brexit and prorogation for the whole hour. Why?</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we get the questions in from the audience, we are trying to plot a way through the programme. But last week the plan was just to try to find a way forward [in the current political stalemate].\u201d</p> \n<p>She began that quest by asking the audience in advance to signal whether they were remainers or leavers, roundheads or cavaliers. The gesture looked like a pre-emptive strike to appease those critics who see bias in the BBC\u2019s every utterance.</p> \n<p>Of course, it achieved no such thing. <em>Question Time</em> has a bigger Twitter response in the UK <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/love-island-beats-politics-tweeted-about-tv-show-2018/1521081\" title=\"\">than any programme other than </a><em><a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/love-island-beats-politics-tweeted-about-tv-show-2018/1521081\" title=\"\">Love Island</a></em>. Each episode of the programme has long since become a real-time media studies lesson. Bruce and the panel and selected members of the audience are freeze-framed for evidence of Brexit collusion or Remoaner conspiracy. No one, it can seem on Twitter at least, is immune to these tribal knee-jerks. Iain Dale, the LBC presenter and Tory commentator, who was a guest on that first show, was thrilled to note the boost it had given to his online following. He immediately fed that crowd by tweeting a tally of the amount of time each panellist had been allowed to speak. Despite the fact that by far the most newsworthy moment of that programme involved Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry being exposed explaining the absurdist contradictions of her party\u2019s current policy, Dale used the data to support his belief that there was an anti-Brexit conspiracy on the show.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4b651e39-3d5d-46c3-b10b-05bd77f89673\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bGnEcyxZIOM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Bruce rolls her eyes just a little. \u201cLast week, it was six people on the panel [instead of the usual five] and that definitely made it harder,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think there is little point counting the minutes and seconds each person gets. Partly because you need to take the political representation over the series rather than one snapshot programme, and of course how much you talk doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect how much impact you have.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Question Time</em> was born in a similar moment of political polarisation: 1979, the first year of the Thatcher government. As the first chair, Sir Robin Day, said, it was an experiment in putting politicians in front of \u201cwhat\u2019s described in TV circles as \u2018real people\u2019 to distinguish them from people who work in television\u201d. It was the third episode before a cabinet minister, Michael Heseltine, appeared, and offered himself as a rather grandiose conductor of the audience\u2019s discontent. Watching those early episodes now, you have a sense of a different kind of relationship between panel and questioners. There is a little more general politeness from the latter, and a degree of anxiety about being the target of Day\u2019s gruff wit. In the years since then, many things have changed. But the most obvious one is that people now have more practice and opportunity in broadcasting opinions \u2013 and belief in their need to be heard.</p> \n<p>In the early days of social media, Dimbleby used to read out the show\u2019s Twitter hashtag in the style of a high court judge presented with the latest fashion in tattoos. Latterly, he acknowledged the highly vocal \u201caudience at home\u201d as a crucial part of the reach of the show. Our greater access to politicians, and to commenting on their every gesture, has led to two things: their calibre has apparently fallen, and the collective mistrust of them has grown. Does Bruce think the relationship is retrievable?</p> \n<p>\u201cThe one thing that <em>Question Time</em> still does which other programmes cannot do is cut through the political messaging,\u201d she says. \u201cI always ask people to be polite; sometimes they are very direct. And as any politician knows, if you face the public directly, anything can happen. Look at Boris Johnson in West Yorkshire the other day \u2013 you just don\u2019t know who is going to shake your hand and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/walkabout-goes-awry-for-johnson-in-straight-talking-yorkshire\" title=\"\"> politely tell you to \u2018leave their town\u2019</a>. That is where the jeopardy comes on <em>Question Time</em> and not all politicians want to come on it, for that reason.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74f4789832c09dd65d3ba6bb21d8a515a0e68ce0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74f4789832c09dd65d3ba6bb21d8a515a0e68ce0/188_246_886_886/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Robin Day, Question Time\u2019s first presenter.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Robin Day, Question Time\u2019s first presenter.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirrorpix/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Those who do rarely seem to have the time or the inclination to utter anything other than practised party lines. Hasn\u2019t it actually become yet another opportunity for the two tribes that now make up our nation to display their colours, and to let off some steam?</p> \n<p>\u201cIt can be cathartic, people like to vent on Brexit, but I still think it works best when people want an answer to a specific question. For example, I remember Nigel Farage was on \u2013 he has actually only been on once since I started \u2013 and someone asked him: \u2018What other country trades only on WTO rules?\u2019 The man in the audience just kept trying to get him to name one, which he didn\u2019t. The best thing, on <em>Question Time</em>, is when the reality confronts the rhetoric.\u201d</p> \n<p>In his own recollections of the programme, Day mentioned that he regretted not having a greater say in choosing panellists. Has Bruce managed to win that concession?</p> \n<p>\u201cI do get involved,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would be wonderful if I could sit there and say: \u2018let\u2019s have Michael Gove this week\u2019, or whatever. But sadly it is not like that. Mostly there is a member of the government and a member of the opposition put forward, and then the rest is worked out over a year to get fair representation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Farage, who has an amazing appearance record, seems to have been a particularly fortunate beneficiary of that system\u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cNot as amazing as Ken Clarke, who has been on it 59 times, I think.\u201d</p> \n<p>But whereas Clarke has held many of the highest offices in the land over half a century, Farage has been on 33 times having never been elected an MP\u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cI am not fully across why that was,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cIt was before my time. He came on with me after the European elections, once, which seemed reasonable, as he led the largest party.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d3f5fb20370477957b27544e0777e9a316c47a7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d3f5fb20370477957b27544e0777e9a316c47a7/28_0_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Question Time in London, 5 September 2019: (left to right) Layla Moran, Richard Tice, Emily Thornberry, Fiona Bruce, Kwasi Kwarteng, Ian Blackford, Iain Dale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Question Time in London, 5 September 2019: (left to right) Layla Moran, Richard Tice, Emily Thornberry, Fiona Bruce, Kwasi Kwarteng, Ian Blackford, Iain Dale.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal News And Sport (Europe)</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In some ways Bruce\u2019s own appointment appeared an odd choice at the time. It was generally accepted that whoever would replace Dimbleby had to be a woman, but others among what Bruce sweetly calls \u201cthe BBC sisterhood\u201d \u2013 Mishal Husain, Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis \u2013 had arguably a greater depth of political experience. Bruce, by all accounts, aced the audition process, which involved a practice live show. Her apparently impermeable good humour was no doubt a factor. Anyone who took the thing more to heart would probably go bonkers after a couple of weeks.</p> \n<p>You don\u2019t have to spend long in her company to understand that her <em>Antiques Roadshow</em> bonhomie is not just for the cameras. There is a cloak of cheery confidence about her. A 2009 appearance on <em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/whodoyouthinkyouare/new-stories/fiona-bruce/index.shtml\" title=\"\">Who Do You Think You Are?</a></em> revealed some of the roots of that, when she traced her father\u2019s family back to an impoverished fishing village in Scotland. Her old man had escaped that, a considerable autodidact, to make it from the post room to the boardroom at Unilever.</p> \n<p>Would she say that he had imbued his youngest child with a sense that anything was possible?</p> \n<p>\u201cHe never said that in so many words. But yes, given where he came from and what he did, I think subconsciously I have always felt that.\u201d</p> \n<p>When <em>Question Time</em> came her way, she followed Dimbleby\u2019s obvious advice and just tried to be herself.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am a simple soul,\u201d she says, not quite believably. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have time to dissemble on live TV even if you wanted to. Everything is happening around you and you just react. If you were also trying to be a character, I\u2019m not sure how you would do that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Day in particular gave the show its knockabout gravitas by being a political insider. Would she count politicians among her friends?</p> \n<p>\u201cThat is not the world I have inhabited. God, who knows how long I will do this and if that will change. But I think it is healthy for me to keep a distance.\u201d</p> \n<p>That sense of perspective, of an outsider\u2019s eye, she suggests, is rooted in a childhood that began in Singapore where her father ran Unilever\u2019s east Asian operation.</p> \n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up in this British system,\u201d she says. The family came back briefly to live on the Wirral when she was six. Then later, until she was 14, she was sent to an international school in Milan, \u201ca Tower of Babel of different languages and nationalities\u201d. Her best friend was Norwegian, and they remain close. She returned from Milan, where she mixed with the \u201ckids of international business people\u201d, to a comprehensive in New Cross, south London, another \u201cbig adjustment\u201d. From there, she used the language skills she had to win a place at Oxford, where she was \u201cinterested in women\u2019s politics and having a good time\u201d. She was very briefly a protester at Greenham Common; she fronted a punky band and dyed her hair blue (but only for a week). She was not involved in student party politics, and never a member of any party \u201cbecause no party has ever had sufficient pull for me. And that is just as well now.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c85e54b4858a47f708b12768a051084c8479966\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c85e54b4858a47f708b12768a051084c8479966/0_110_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Dimbleby with guest Tony Blair in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Dimbleby with guest Tony Blair in 2000.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ison/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Her desire to go into journalism came quite late. She worked at the management consultancy Accenture for a year, with airy ideas of an MBA, but spent much of it crying in the loos. She escaped to a job in advertising for four years \u2013 \u201chad a blast\u201d \u2013 and met her husband of 25 years, Nigel Sharrocks, who was a director at the BMP agency. She eventually talked her way into a job as a researcher on <em>Panorama</em> after she met its editor at a wedding.</p> \n<p>She became the first woman to have presented both <em>News at Six</em> and <em>News at 10</em>. Does she think of herself as a presenter or a journalist?</p> \n<p>\u201cI think of myself as a journalist first and foremost.\u201d</p> \n<p>Before Dimbleby took on the <em>Question Time</em> job, Jeremy Paxman auditioned. By some accounts he savaged both the panel and the audience. Does Bruce feel TV journalism has to be combative to get at the truth?</p> \n<p>\u201cNot always. I had done debate programmes before and quite often you go into them thinking: \u2018I might need to build some energy in the room.\u2019 On <em>Question Time</em>, the reverse is true. A lot of the time, I am just trying to not have it turn into a slanging match. You want some heat in the programme, but you need more light than heat. I think if I don\u2019t do that, sometimes it is just going to run away and be incredibly ill tempered. Who wants to watch that?\u201d</p> \n<p>The answer to that question is perhaps: quite a lot of people. For a while, in more politically stable times, there seemed to be an effort to invite mostly career contrarians on the programme in case it became dull. Ten years ago, there was considerable furore around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/23/bnp-nick-griffin-question-time\" title=\"\">the appearance of BNP leader Nick Griffin</a>. More than 8 million people \u2013 nearly three times the regular audience, and still easily a record \u2013 tuned in to see him undone by Jack Straw and Bonnie Greer. Could Bruce imagine having a figure like Tommy Robinson on?</p> \n<p>The thing about Griffin was that he had become an MEP, Bruce says. \u201cIf Robinson hasn\u2019t won representation through a national election, then the question wouldn\u2019t arise.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b90ec931222158d2612c52681eec10f332103b48\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b90ec931222158d2612c52681eec10f332103b48/0_382_5729_3437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiona Bruce on Antiques Roadshow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiona Bruce on Antiques Roadshow.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Gordon/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The audience appetite for something of a political ruck, however, appears to have sharpened, ingrained by the winner-takes-all mentality of first past the post, and a mistrust of coalition and compromise. Since about the time <em>Question Time</em> first appeared on our screens, it could be argued that we have increased the demand for politicians to entertain us, to be colourful rather than competent. We are, you might say, now reaping that particular whirlwind.</p> \n<p>The present prime minister was a regular fixture on Dimbleby\u2019s <em>Question Time</em> panels. He played a characteristic part in one of the most memorable exchanges on the programme, when the panel debated the award of a knighthood to Salman Rushdie in 2007. Dame Shirley Williams, surprisingly and to her discredit, suggested that the honour was ill judged since it risked insulting some Muslim groups and inflaming tensions. The late Christopher Hitchens made a robust defence of the novelist\u2019s right to offend, with a righteous erudition rarely heard on British TV. When Johnson\u2019s turn came, he inevitably ducked that nuanced and principled argument, and instead mumbled a crowd-pleasing wish that the knighthood had gone to an English novelist with \u201ca grasp of plot and character\u201d: Dick Francis was his suggestion.<br>One result of that ongoing desire for politicians that look for easy applause, rather than confronting hard choices, is a sense of debate as a zero-sum game, rather than an attempt to find consensus. The clips that trend on Twitter from <em>Question Time</em> are often prefaced by the language of cage fighting: \u201cWatch X get owned by Y\u201d; \u201cY tears Z a new one\u201d. The clips are followed by dialogue in which people shout intemperately on Twitter about <em>Question Time</em> being unwatchable because it reflects a nation in which people shout intemperately.</p> \n<p>It is hard to see that temper cooling. Does Bruce imagine that she might soon have to start programmes by asking everyone to play nicely?</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the schoolmarm. You just have to sense the feeling in the room. We had one guy who became so irate he stood up and started haranguing one of the panellists. I had to tell him to sit down, which sounded a little odd.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"009d48a9e9a616e3f0f79dd54dac2b8441d8bc2f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/009d48a9e9a616e3f0f79dd54dac2b8441d8bc2f/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crowds outside New Broadcasting House in central London protest against then BNP leader Nick Griffin\u2019s 2009 Question Time appearance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crowds outside the BBC\u2019s former headquarters in White City, London, protest against then BNP leader Nick Griffin\u2019s 2009 Question Time appearance.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The other armchair <em>Question Time</em> sport is the opportunity is provides for the current national pastime of bias-hunting. It is good fodder for those who would rather put our current political impasse down to a misjudged sneer from John Humphrys on the <em>Today</em> programme, or an answer cut short by Fiona Bruce, than to three decades of rising inequality and underinvestment in infrastructure and skills. The BBC has been found wanting in various ways in reporting our political meltdown, but those who, like the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, call it \u201cthe Brexit Broadcasting Corporation\u201d, or conversely, along with Nigel Farage, characterise it as \u201cthe enemy\u201d should be careful what they wish for.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe BBC value I aspire to represent on <em>Question Time</em> is simply impartiality,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cFrom what I can tell on social media people think the programme is too rightwing. And when you look at the audience research we get people thinking it is too leftwing. I can only hope we fall between those two and plot a course down the middle.\u201d</p> \n<p>The problem is that the middle ground no longer appears to exist, even as a widely held aspiration. Bruce can look like an easy target for those political forces that want to suggest the BBC is the voice of a supposed metropolitan elite. She has homes in Hampstead and Oxfordshire, and has been known to write about nice holidays for the <em>Telegraph</em>. I wonder if she thinks the scrutiny of the corporation in general and <em>Question Tim</em>e in particular has been helped or hindered by publishing presenters\u2019 and journalists\u2019 salaries? (Bruce\u2019s was reportedly between \u00a3350,000 and \u00a3400,000 before she accepted the <em>Question Time</em> job.)</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it has been helpful for women. And I think: why not?\u201d</p> \n<p>Does she not think average earners might look at those numbers and think: why on earth are taxpayers paying TV presenters four times as much as the prime minister?</p> \n<p>\u201cI can understand that. And I feel incredibly lucky to be doing the jobs I do and be remunerated as I am.\u201d</p> \n<p>Does she see any danger of becoming too far removed from the people she is giving voice to, the audience and the viewers?</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that.

      "bodyText": "Question Time turns 40 at the end of this month. The BBC institution is not immune to that birthday\u2019s particular mix of crisis and denial. While the programme\u2019s 25th year was marked with affectionate celebration and nostalgic retrospectives, this time around there will be little fanfare. Mostly, you imagine, like many of us who have experienced that midlife milestone, the show would ideally like to take to its bed in a darkened room to fret about its blood pressure and its sell-by date, and to relive those golden years before any red-faced audience member ever yelled the words \u201cno deal\u201d or \u201cconfirmatory vote\u201d or \u201cthe Irish backstop\u201d. For those who hold to the idea that politics and journalism should be more about listening than lecturing, more about informed doubt than angry certainty, Question Time has for a long while been an uncomfortable watch. Since the redoubtable charmer David Dimbleby finally threw in the towel after 25 years, aged 80, in December, the hottest seat in British broadcasting has belonged to Fiona Bruce, who maintains a measure of order with a mixture of good humour and exasperation and that judiciously raised eyebrow. Her early outings on the show were praised for their briskness and confidence. As this long year has worn on, however, she has, like the rest of us, looked a little more beleaguered. She was not 20 minutes into the first show after the summer break before she was calling a time-out to the partisan bickering: \u201cWe are better than this.\u201d Most evidence in the current public square suggests that we are not. I met her last Monday, at the same moment that her equivalent in the House of Commons, John Bercow, was announcing his departure. She had been instrumental, the week before, in bringing back Question Time earlier than scheduled \u201cbecause we all felt it was important for people to be able to hold their elected representatives to account in the absence of parliament\u201d. Was there a part of her that wished she had stuck to Fake Or Fortune?, The Antiques Roadshow and the news? She insists none at all. \u201cAt the moment, Question Time occupies so much mental energy [for me]. But I tell myself a) times will not always be this fraught, and b) I will get more used to it. So it won\u2019t always be like this.\u201d I wish I shared her confidence. That first week back she gave in to the inevitable and the audience talked Brexit and prorogation for the whole hour. Why? \u201cWhen we get the questions in from the audience, we are trying to plot a way through the programme. But last week the plan was just to try to find a way forward [in the current political stalemate].\u201d She began that quest by asking the audience in advance to signal whether they were remainers or leavers, roundheads or cavaliers. The gesture looked like a pre-emptive strike to appease those critics who see bias in the BBC\u2019s every utterance. Of course, it achieved no such thing. Question Time has a bigger Twitter response in the UK than any programme other than Love Island. Each episode of the programme has long since become a real-time media studies lesson. Bruce and the panel and selected members of the audience are freeze-framed for evidence of Brexit collusion or Remoaner conspiracy. No one, it can seem on Twitter at least, is immune to these tribal knee-jerks. Iain Dale, the LBC presenter and Tory commentator, who was a guest on that first show, was thrilled to note the boost it had given to his online following. He immediately fed that crowd by tweeting a tally of the amount of time each panellist had been allowed to speak. Despite the fact that by far the most newsworthy moment of that programme involved Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry being exposed explaining the absurdist contradictions of her party\u2019s current policy, Dale used the data to support his belief that there was an anti-Brexit conspiracy on the show. Bruce rolls her eyes just a little. \u201cLast week, it was six people on the panel [instead of the usual five] and that definitely made it harder,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think there is little point counting the minutes and seconds each person gets. Partly because you need to take the political representation over the series rather than one snapshot programme, and of course how much you talk doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect how much impact you have.\u201d Question Time was born in a similar moment of political polarisation: 1979, the first year of the Thatcher government. As the first chair, Sir Robin Day, said, it was an experiment in putting politicians in front of \u201cwhat\u2019s described in TV circles as \u2018real people\u2019 to distinguish them from people who work in television\u201d. It was the third episode before a cabinet minister, Michael Heseltine, appeared, and offered himself as a rather grandiose conductor of the audience\u2019s discontent. Watching those early episodes now, you have a sense of a different kind of relationship between panel and questioners. There is a little more general politeness from the latter, and a degree of anxiety about being the target of Day\u2019s gruff wit. In the years since then, many things have changed. But the most obvious one is that people now have more practice and opportunity in broadcasting opinions \u2013 and belief in their need to be heard. In the early days of social media, Dimbleby used to read out the show\u2019s Twitter hashtag in the style of a high court judge presented with the latest fashion in tattoos. Latterly, he acknowledged the highly vocal \u201caudience at home\u201d as a crucial part of the reach of the show. Our greater access to politicians, and to commenting on their every gesture, has led to two things: their calibre has apparently fallen, and the collective mistrust of them has grown. Does Bruce think the relationship is retrievable? \u201cThe one thing that Question Time still does which other programmes cannot do is cut through the political messaging,\u201d she says. \u201cI always ask people to be polite; sometimes they are very direct. And as any politician knows, if you face the public directly, anything can happen. Look at Boris Johnson in West Yorkshire the other day \u2013 you just don\u2019t know who is going to shake your hand and politely tell you to \u2018leave their town\u2019. That is where the jeopardy comes on Question Time and not all politicians want to come on it, for that reason.\u201d Those who do rarely seem to have the time or the inclination to utter anything other than practised party lines. Hasn\u2019t it actually become yet another opportunity for the two tribes that now make up our nation to display their colours, and to let off some steam? \u201cIt can be cathartic, people like to vent on Brexit, but I still think it works best when people want an answer to a specific question. For example, I remember Nigel Farage was on \u2013 he has actually only been on once since I started \u2013 and someone asked him: \u2018What other country trades only on WTO rules?\u2019 The man in the audience just kept trying to get him to name one, which he didn\u2019t. The best thing, on Question Time, is when the reality confronts the rhetoric.\u201d In his own recollections of the programme, Day mentioned that he regretted not having a greater say in choosing panellists. Has Bruce managed to win that concession? \u201cI do get involved,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would be wonderful if I could sit there and say: \u2018let\u2019s have Michael Gove this week\u2019, or whatever. But sadly it is not like that. Mostly there is a member of the government and a member of the opposition put forward, and then the rest is worked out over a year to get fair representation.\u201d Farage, who has an amazing appearance record, seems to have been a particularly fortunate beneficiary of that system\u2026 \u201cNot as amazing as Ken Clarke, who has been on it 59 times, I think.\u201d But whereas Clarke has held many of the highest offices in the land over half a century, Farage has been on 33 times having never been elected an MP\u2026 \u201cI am not fully across why that was,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cIt was before my time. He came on with me after the European elections, once, which seemed reasonable, as he led the largest party.\u201d In some ways Bruce\u2019s own appointment appeared an odd choice at the time. It was generally accepted that whoever would replace Dimbleby had to be a woman, but others among what Bruce sweetly calls \u201cthe BBC sisterhood\u201d \u2013 Mishal Husain, Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis \u2013 had arguably a greater depth of political experience. Bruce, by all accounts, aced the audition process, which involved a practice live show. Her apparently impermeable good humour was no doubt a factor. Anyone who took the thing more to heart would probably go bonkers after a couple of weeks. You don\u2019t have to spend long in her company to understand that her Antiques Roadshow bonhomie is not just for the cameras. There is a cloak of cheery confidence about her. A 2009 appearance on Who Do You Think You Are? revealed some of the roots of that, when she traced her father\u2019s family back to an impoverished fishing village in Scotland. Her old man had escaped that, a considerable autodidact, to make it from the post room to the boardroom at Unilever. Would she say that he had imbued his youngest child with a sense that anything was possible? \u201cHe never said that in so many words. But yes, given where he came from and what he did, I think subconsciously I have always felt that.\u201d When Question Time came her way, she followed Dimbleby\u2019s obvious advice and just tried to be herself. \u201cI am a simple soul,\u201d she says, not quite believably. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have time to dissemble on live TV even if you wanted to. Everything is happening around you and you just react. If you were also trying to be a character, I\u2019m not sure how you would do that.\u201d Day in particular gave the show its knockabout gravitas by being a political insider. Would she count politicians among her friends? \u201cThat is not the world I have inhabited. God, who knows how long I will do this and if that will change. But I think it is healthy for me to keep a distance.\u201d That sense of perspective, of an outsider\u2019s eye, she suggests, is rooted in a childhood that began in Singapore where her father ran Unilever\u2019s east Asian operation. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up in this British system,\u201d she says. The family came back briefly to live on the Wirral when she was six. Then later, until she was 14, she was sent to an international school in Milan, \u201ca Tower of Babel of different languages and nationalities\u201d. Her best friend was Norwegian, and they remain close. She returned from Milan, where she mixed with the \u201ckids of international business people\u201d, to a comprehensive in New Cross, south London, another \u201cbig adjustment\u201d. From there, she used the language skills she had to win a place at Oxford, where she was \u201cinterested in women\u2019s politics and having a good time\u201d. She was very briefly a protester at Greenham Common; she fronted a punky band and dyed her hair blue (but only for a week). She was not involved in student party politics, and never a member of any party \u201cbecause no party has ever had sufficient pull for me. And that is just as well now.\u201d Her desire to go into journalism came quite late. She worked at the management consultancy Accenture for a year, with airy ideas of an MBA, but spent much of it crying in the loos. She escaped to a job in advertising for four years \u2013 \u201chad a blast\u201d \u2013 and met her husband of 25 years, Nigel Sharrocks, who was a director at the BMP agency. She eventually talked her way into a job as a researcher on Panorama after she met its editor at a wedding. She became the first woman to have presented both News at Six and News at 10. Does she think of herself as a presenter or a journalist? \u201cI think of myself as a journalist first and foremost.\u201d Before Dimbleby took on the Question Time job, Jeremy Paxman auditioned. By some accounts he savaged both the panel and the audience. Does Bruce feel TV journalism has to be combative to get at the truth? \u201cNot always. I had done debate programmes before and quite often you go into them thinking: \u2018I might need to build some energy in the room.\u2019 On Question Time, the reverse is true. A lot of the time, I am just trying to not have it turn into a slanging match. You want some heat in the programme, but you need more light than heat. I think if I don\u2019t do that, sometimes it is just going to run away and be incredibly ill tempered. Who wants to watch that?\u201d The answer to that question is perhaps: quite a lot of people. For a while, in more politically stable times, there seemed to be an effort to invite mostly career contrarians on the programme in case it became dull. Ten years ago, there was considerable furore around the appearance of BNP leader Nick Griffin. More than 8 million people \u2013 nearly three times the regular audience, and still easily a record \u2013 tuned in to see him undone by Jack Straw and Bonnie Greer. Could Bruce imagine having a figure like Tommy Robinson on? The thing about Griffin was that he had become an MEP, Bruce says. \u201cIf Robinson hasn\u2019t won representation through a national election, then the question wouldn\u2019t arise.\u201d The audience appetite for something of a political ruck, however, appears to have sharpened, ingrained by the winner-takes-all mentality of first past the post, and a mistrust of coalition and compromise. Since about the time Question Time first appeared on our screens, it could be argued that we have increased the demand for politicians to entertain us, to be colourful rather than competent. We are, you might say, now reaping that particular whirlwind. The present prime minister was a regular fixture on Dimbleby\u2019s Question Time panels. He played a characteristic part in one of the most memorable exchanges on the programme, when the panel debated the award of a knighthood to Salman Rushdie in 2007. Dame Shirley Williams, surprisingly and to her discredit, suggested that the honour was ill judged since it risked insulting some Muslim groups and inflaming tensions. The late Christopher Hitchens made a robust defence of the novelist\u2019s right to offend, with a righteous erudition rarely heard on British TV. When Johnson\u2019s turn came, he inevitably ducked that nuanced and principled argument, and instead mumbled a crowd-pleasing wish that the knighthood had gone to an English novelist with \u201ca grasp of plot and character\u201d: Dick Francis was his suggestion. One result of that ongoing desire for politicians that look for easy applause, rather than confronting hard choices, is a sense of debate as a zero-sum game, rather than an attempt to find consensus. The clips that trend on Twitter from Question Time are often prefaced by the language of cage fighting: \u201cWatch X get owned by Y\u201d; \u201cY tears Z a new one\u201d. The clips are followed by dialogue in which people shout intemperately on Twitter about Question Time being unwatchable because it reflects a nation in which people shout intemperately. It is hard to see that temper cooling. Does Bruce imagine that she might soon have to start programmes by asking everyone to play nicely? \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the schoolmarm. You just have to sense the feeling in the room. We had one guy who became so irate he stood up and started haranguing one of the panellists. I had to tell him to sit down, which sounded a little odd.\u201d The other armchair Question Time sport is the opportunity is provides for the current national pastime of bias-hunting. It is good fodder for those who would rather put our current political impasse down to a misjudged sneer from John Humphrys on the Today programme, or an answer cut short by Fiona Bruce, than to three decades of rising inequality and underinvestment in infrastructure and skills. The BBC has been found wanting in various ways in reporting our political meltdown, but those who, like the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, call it \u201cthe Brexit Broadcasting Corporation\u201d, or conversely, along with Nigel Farage, characterise it as \u201cthe enemy\u201d should be careful what they wish for. \u201cThe BBC value I aspire to represent on Question Time is simply impartiality,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cFrom what I can tell on social media people think the programme is too rightwing. And when you look at the audience research we get people thinking it is too leftwing. I can only hope we fall between those two and plot a course down the middle.\u201d The problem is that the middle ground no longer appears to exist, even as a widely held aspiration. Bruce can look like an easy target for those political forces that want to suggest the BBC is the voice of a supposed metropolitan elite. She has homes in Hampstead and Oxfordshire, and has been known to write about nice holidays for the Telegraph. I wonder if she thinks the scrutiny of the corporation in general and Question Time in particular has been helped or hindered by publishing presenters\u2019 and journalists\u2019 salaries? (Bruce\u2019s was reportedly between \u00a3350,000 and \u00a3400,000 before she accepted the Question Time job.) \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it has been helpful for women. And I think: why not?\u201d Does she not think average earners might look at those numbers and think: why on earth are taxpayers paying TV presenters four times as much as the prime minister? \u201cI can understand that. And I feel incredibly lucky to be doing the jobs I do and be remunerated as I am.\u201d Does she see any danger of becoming too far removed from the people she is giving voice to, the audience and the viewers? \u201cI don\u2019t think that. But I also think that is partly why I cannot see myself becoming the person who goes to Westminster parties and so on. I see my role on the programme as helping the audience get their answers.\u201d You believe Bruce when she says she has the will to escape from work, though it can be all-encompassing. \u201cI go and walk the dog or go horse-riding or whatever it is in the great outdoors and that, for me, is a switch-off,\u201d she says. \u201cMy daughter does not like to talk about politics, though my son does, but that means we talk about it at home less than we might. I try not to look at my phone. There was a period where I had Trump\u2019s tweets coming up and that got in my head, so I stopped. But these last couple of weeks it has been impossible, obviously.

Then again, someone once threw a bread roll at Tony Blair at the end of the show and we haven\u2019t had that yet.\u201d If the show holds a mirror up to Britain, what does it currently look like from where she is sitting? \u201cWe are just so angry,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd people feel so let down and not listened to and unrepresented, on both sides. It is not a happy country at all at the moment.\u201d Does she not fear, whatever madness happens in the coming months, that if she sits there for another five years, or 10 years, every show is going to be about Brexit and its consequences? She winces at the thought. \u201cThat can\u2019t happen can it? Surely years of negotiating the minutiae of trade deals behind closed doors will not be the same?\u201d It only won\u2019t be the same, I suggest, if we belatedly rediscover the arts of consensus, listening, taking on board expert knowledge, and learning how to disagree better. Bruce fervently believes that Question Time has a role to play in that, and also in helping the nation to plot a course through the current mess. I admire her confidence.

      "body": "<p>January will mark 20 years since three former Goldman Sachs bankers with no experience of food retailing hatched a plan for an online grocer.</p> <p>The company started off as Last Mile Solutions and soon changed its name to Ocado. The rest is history \u2013 but a bumpy one. Ocado has fallen in and out of favour since its flotation in 2010 as investors have waited for Tim Steiner, its chief executive and the last of the trio remaining, to make good on his pledge to revolutionise food shopping.</p> <p>As it prepares to publish a trading update on Tuesday, Ocado has made an annual profit on only three occasions; it lost \u00a344.4m last year. Its share of the UK grocery market is a niche 1.4%, made up largely of middle-class shoppers. Yet it is on a high at the moment: the share price hit a record \u00a314.40 in April and is not far off that peak now.</p> <p>There are two reasons for investors\u2019 enthusiasm. Ocado signed a deal in February to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/27/marks-and-spencer-agrees-750m-food-delivery-deal-with-ocado\" title=\"\">sell 50% of its retail division to Marks &amp; Spencer</a>.

      "bodyText": "January will mark 20 years since three former Goldman Sachs bankers with no experience of food retailing hatched a plan for an online grocer. The company started off as Last Mile Solutions and soon changed its name to Ocado. The rest is history \u2013 but a bumpy one. Ocado has fallen in and out of favour since its flotation in 2010 as investors have waited for Tim Steiner, its chief executive and the last of the trio remaining, to make good on his pledge to revolutionise food shopping. As it prepares to publish a trading update on Tuesday, Ocado has made an annual profit on only three occasions; it lost \u00a344.4m last year. Its share of the UK grocery market is a niche 1.4%, made up largely of middle-class shoppers. Yet it is on a high at the moment: the share price hit a record \u00a314.40 in April and is not far off that peak now. There are two reasons for investors\u2019 enthusiasm. Ocado signed a deal in February to sell 50% of its retail division to Marks &amp; Spencer. The joint venture is meant to end M&amp;S\u2019s struggle to sell food online by letting it use Ocado\u2019s technology and delivery network. M&amp;S\u2019s upfront payment of \u00a3562.5m also gave Ocado plenty of money to spend on shifting from the low-margin business of selling groceries to become a technology platform. The idea is that retailers pay for Ocado\u2019s robots, algorithms and other innovations and avoid the cost and bother of developing their own. Ocado says no other company can equip retailers to serve customers right from the online purchase to the van arriving at their home. It has signed eight \u201csolutions\u201d deals in Europe, Australia and North America, including an agreement to operate 20 automated warehouses for Kroger, the US\u2019s biggest supermarket chain. To Ocado\u2019s 745,000 UK customers it remains a grocer delivering quinoa in one-hour slots but that business now plays second fiddle. Tuesday\u2019s trading statement will stick to reporting figures for the retail business, but investors will want to know how the solutions arm is going. They may also want further reassurance about the impact of a fire that destroyed Ocado\u2019s flagship warehouse in Andover, Hampshire, in February. At \u00a39.3bn, Ocado\u2019s market value is more than double that of M&amp;S \u2013 and some analysts think investors are banking on returns that may not materialise. Ian Hunter at Investec says: \u201cWhile there is undoubted value in the division\u2019s robotic systems and their rollout \u2026 with a range of partners in different geographies, we believe the market is pricing in too ambitious a rollout programme.\u201d The deal to deliver M&amp;S food from next year also requires households to switch their allegiance from Waitrose, which has supplied products for Ocado since the beginning. Waitrose inspires plenty of loyalty, and a survey of Ocado customers in March found that more than a fifth said they would ditch an Ocado with no Waitrose. With solutions projects on three continents and more in the pipeline, Ocado admits it has a lot on its plate. It also acknowledges that some Waitrose devotees will probably leave when M&amp;S takes over at the retail division. Ocado has promised to replicate every Waitrose product with a version from M&amp;S or somewhere else, and it reckons that M&amp;S\u2019s 7,500 food products \u2013 almost double the number provided by Waitrose \u2013 will attract new customers.

      "body": "<p>Of all the qualities the All Blacks will miss when Steve Hansen\u2019s eight-year tenure, and one of the great world rugby eras, comes to a close at the World Cup, his ability to turn Zen-like master is possibly least appreciated. Describe Hansen in one word and it must be \u201ccomposed\u201d. It was not always this way. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p> <p>These days, as his last stand approaches in Japan, Hansen is almost unflappable, having near-defined the art of calming influence. Such a feat is no easy task while guiding the world\u2019s most demanding, glory-hungry, panicked rugby nation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-england-joe-cokanasiga-wales-wallabies\">England\u2019s Joe Cokanasiga admits nerves when facing Wales and Wallabies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Three weeks ago in Perth, two games out from their World Cup opener, the All Blacks conceded the most points in their history in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/10/against-all-odds-wallabies-restore-pride-against-all-blacks\" title=\"\">record 47-26 defeat</a> to the Wallabies, a team with little prior form. Never mind the circumstances of New Zealand playing the second half with 14 men after Scott Barrett\u2019s red card, the loss sent tremors through New Zealand as if Mount Ruapehu was erupting again.</p> <p>Allow these impassioned kneejerk reactions to infiltrate the team, and the collapse of the three-times world champions would be a weekly occurrence. Hansen instead fronted up with his typical \u201cwe\u2019ve got this\u201d attitude and the All Blacks righted their wrong the following week with an order-restoring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/17/all-blacks-deliver-bledisloe-pain-with-36-point-whitewash-of-wallabies\" title=\"\">36-0 demolition</a> of Australia at Eden Park. World Cup fears allayed, for the moment at least.</p> <p>Hansen does not get it right every time, but more often than not he has come to represent a mood\u2011soothing presence.</p> <p>Wayne Smith, the former All Blacks and Northampton coach and a longtime confidant whose rugby relationship with Hansen dates back to the early 1980s in Canterbury, recognises this serenity. \u201cHe\u2019s been a steady hand on the ship, so when things like Perth have occurred he\u2019s stopped any form of panic going through,\u201d Smith, dubbed the Professor for his deep-rooted knowledge of the game, says.</p> <p>\u201cOne of his greatest attributes has been to calm the public down; to say: \u2018Yeah we weren\u2019t that good, we understand that, but we\u2019re going to be way better next week.\u2019 You need to understand how the All Blacks work and how their minds work. There\u2019s so much pride and love for the jersey in that group that they\u2019re always going to bounce back from a poor result. He emits that attitude in everything he says and does so he takes a lot of stress away for people.\u201d</p> <p>Hansen\u2019s win ratio as head coach since 2012 sits at near 89% \u2013 nine losses in 100 Tests \u2013 safely placing him among the pantheon of elite sporting, not merely rugby, mentors.

      "bodyText": "Of all the qualities the All Blacks will miss when Steve Hansen\u2019s eight-year tenure, and one of the great world rugby eras, comes to a close at the World Cup, his ability to turn Zen-like master is possibly least appreciated. Describe Hansen in one word and it must be \u201ccomposed\u201d. It was not always this way. Quite the opposite, in fact. These days, as his last stand approaches in Japan, Hansen is almost unflappable, having near-defined the art of calming influence. Such a feat is no easy task while guiding the world\u2019s most demanding, glory-hungry, panicked rugby nation. Three weeks ago in Perth, two games out from their World Cup opener, the All Blacks conceded the most points in their history in the record 47-26 defeat to the Wallabies, a team with little prior form. Never mind the circumstances of New Zealand playing the second half with 14 men after Scott Barrett\u2019s red card, the loss sent tremors through New Zealand as if Mount Ruapehu was erupting again. Allow these impassioned kneejerk reactions to infiltrate the team, and the collapse of the three-times world champions would be a weekly occurrence. Hansen instead fronted up with his typical \u201cwe\u2019ve got this\u201d attitude and the All Blacks righted their wrong the following week with an order-restoring 36-0 demolition of Australia at Eden Park. World Cup fears allayed, for the moment at least. Hansen does not get it right every time, but more often than not he has come to represent a mood\u2011soothing presence. Wayne Smith, the former All Blacks and Northampton coach and a longtime confidant whose rugby relationship with Hansen dates back to the early 1980s in Canterbury, recognises this serenity. \u201cHe\u2019s been a steady hand on the ship, so when things like Perth have occurred he\u2019s stopped any form of panic going through,\u201d Smith, dubbed the Professor for his deep-rooted knowledge of the game, says. \u201cOne of his greatest attributes has been to calm the public down; to say: \u2018Yeah we weren\u2019t that good, we understand that, but we\u2019re going to be way better next week.\u2019 You need to understand how the All Blacks work and how their minds work. There\u2019s so much pride and love for the jersey in that group that they\u2019re always going to bounce back from a poor result. He emits that attitude in everything he says and does so he takes a lot of stress away for people.\u201d Hansen\u2019s win ratio as head coach since 2012 sits at near 89% \u2013 nine losses in 100 Tests \u2013 safely placing him among the pantheon of elite sporting, not merely rugby, mentors. Four years ago he made history by steering the All Blacks to their first retention of the World Cup with victory over Australia in the final at Twickenham. Now he seeks a third successive crown in Japan. Though the end is nigh, Hansen is reticent to make his final campaign anything like the last gunfight at the OK Corral. Talk of past deeds distracts from present quests, and so any such murmurings are deemed unhelpful to the team-first, task\u2011focused mantra the All Blacks strive to live every day. Hansen\u2019s shadow, though, cannot be dismissed.

Then came the bereaved family and Mugabe\u2019s successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, followed by foreign dignitaries, before a small crowd of ministers and officials from the ruling Zanu-PF party.</p> \n<p>The band played lively hymns, the sun shone on the tubas, trumpets and trombones. The drums crashed and rattled. When the casket was settled in the shade beside a white and yellow wreath bearing the words, a choir sang jaunty methodist hymns, and the speeches began.</p> \n<p>Mugabe died, aged 95, this month in a private clinic in Singapore. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/robert-mugabe-resigns-as-president-of-zimbabwe\" title=\"\">ousted in November 2017</a> after 37 years in power. The official order of service was coy about the brutality of the bloodless military takeover, launched by Mugabe\u2019s closest aides, that deposed the former ruler. \u201cComrade Mugabe retired \u2026 after a long and distinguished political career,\u201d it read.</p> \n<p>Among those filing on to the concrete stands, there was deep respect for the man who fought a guerrilla war to overcome a white supremacist regime and bring full independence to his nation. \u201cI am here to pay tribute to our former president. He is an icon of our nation. He did so many things for us. He encouraged women to work for ourselves and get educated,\u201d said Joyce Mutyakurera, a 30-year-old administrator.</p> \n<p>Jackson Njambo, 35, who had travelled from a poor neighbourhood on the outskirts of Harare, said Mugabe had stood up to the west. \u201cHe liberated our country and defended us against all the countries that want to take our land and resources and make us a colony again,\u201d the builder said.</p> \n<p>Such sentiments were echoed in the speeches that would boom out across the stadium in the hours to follow. This was a commemoration not just of Mugabe\u2019s life \u2013 as a freedom fighter against western colonialism and racism \u2013 but of his vision of Africa and its struggle against the west too.</p> \n<p>If the early years of Mugabe\u2019s rule saw a series of progressive measures, welcomed by overseas observers, its later decades were characterised by economic mismanagement and brutal suppression of growing opposition. Isolated from the west and much of the international community, Mugabe and his officials turned increasingly to a new coalition of allies and collaborators: the Kabila family in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Theodore Obiang of Equatorial Guinea, China, Russia and Cuba.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0049f7f5bde9a5966b8f1af520150d3f9e150b0b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0049f7f5bde9a5966b8f1af520150d3f9e150b0b/182_0_4639_2784/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Empty seats during the ceremony at the National Sports Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Empty seats during the ceremony at the National Sports Stadium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Themba Hadebe/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Obiang, 77, was the first to address the thin crowds seeking the shade on the stadium\u2019s terraces on Saturday. The veteran ruler, whose country is mired in poverty despite its vast oil riches, said Mugabe had joined a long list of \u201cliberation struggle leaders in Africa\u201d, including Nelson Mandela, and added that the funeral would give a \u201clasting sense of democracy to the policies and position of President Mnangagwa\u201d.</p> \n<p>This of course was a key reason for the pomp of the public ceremony: the line of soldiers, police and presidential guardsmen standing in the sun, the three-gun salute and the presence of all the foreign dignitaries. For Mnangagwa and those close to him \u2013 struggling with a deepening economic crisis, massive debts, continuing international isolation and significant domestic opposition to their rule \u2013 the death of Zimbabwe\u2019s former ruler was an opportunity to assume the role of legitimate successors to the \u201cfounder of the nation\u201d and to obscure the fact that Mugabe had no desire to leave power.</p> \n<p>But this proved harder to arrange than many within the deeply divided ruling party had clearly believed. Mugabe had made no secret of his bitterness, telling journalists at his last public appearance that he and his second wife, Grace, had been mistreated by the new rulers of the country. Grace, 54, refused to allow Mnangagwa to preside over a burial, and her late husband will now be interred in a month once a suitable tomb has been constructed at the monument reserved for \u201cnational heroes\u201d on a ridge overlooking Harare.</p> \n<p>A family representative, Walter Chidakwa, spoke to the crowds in the stadium on Saturday of the \u201cstrong views\u201d of Mugabe and his insistence on \u201cintegrity\u201d. Many took his words as an indirect reproach to Mnangagwa. \u201cOur father told us to be who you are,\u201d Chidakwa said. \u201cTowards the end of his life he was a sad man. A sad, sad, sad man. He recalled quietly the journey he had walked. A profound journey, a hard and excruciating journey.\u201d</p> \n<p>But if Mugabe has gone, his legacy remains. There is the crumbling infrastructure, soaring inflation and vast debts that have crippled the economy, leaving millions facing hunger. There is also the reflex authoritarianism and powerful security establishment that seeks to crush opposition.</p> \n<p>And there is the strategic alignment: envoys from Havana, Beijing and Moscow spoke attended the funeral, speaking more or less interchangeably of their loss of a great friend and ally, their unbreakable friendships with Zimbabwe and the injustice of the sanctions imposed on the country by the EU and the US during Mugabe\u2019s rule.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27640c92f9340c4c6125313b96da319bc53be2ef\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27640c92f9340c4c6125313b96da319bc53be2ef/0_346_3935_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women in the stands hold posters of the former president.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women in the stands hold posters of the former president.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Curtis/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When it was the current president\u2019s turn to address the crowd \u2013 which barely filled a quarter of the vast stadium \u2013 Mnangagwa spoke of his own desire to see \u201ca Zimbabwe free of the albatross of sanctions\u201d.</p> \n<p>There was little evidence of the fresh approach he promised in the runup to elections last year, other than the crowd of foreign journalists before the podium. International media had been almost entirely banned in recent years.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn many ways, Mugabe could have given that speech,\u201d said Blessing-Miles Tendi, an expert and author from Oxford University. \u201cThere were very familiar themes: sovereignty, sanctions, and no recognition of the failings of the government itself. The man is gone, but his ideas and methods live on.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a gesture that many praised, opposition leaders had been invited to the funeral, including some from the Movement for Democratic Change, which headed protests against Mugabe and suffered repeated waves of repression as a consequence.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn African culture you are bound to be present [at a funeral]. We are here for Mugabe, not for Mnangagwa or Zanu-PF,\u201d said Job Sikhala, an MDC parliamentarian, shortly before the ceremony.</p> \n<p>Sikhala, who is facing treason charges for his political activities and a potentially heavy prison term, said Mugabe\u2019s pan-African ideology might have brought the late ruler admirers across the continent but was an anachronism. \u201cColonialism left its pains and scars \u2026 but we believe that 40 years after independence there is no point in crying over spilt milk. Africa needs its own solutions.\u201d</p> \n<p>The speeches went on. Any early excitement ebbed. The flow of supporters into the stadium began to reverse. The guns fired their salute and 95 doves were released into the air. The presidential guard \u2013 blamed for the shooting of six civilians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/01/zanu-pf-wins-majority-of-seats-in-zimbabwe-parliament-elections\" title=\"\">days after the elections last year</a> \u2013 huddled around the casket.</p> \n<p>Grace Mugabe, her face veiled, her robes black, stood and watched. The soldiers lifted and began a slow, steady march out of the stadium followed by the bereaved family, the president, ministers, a large number of senior soldiers in diverse uniforms with braid and medals, and, after some time, the foreign dignitaries.</p> \n<p>The band thumped and blared and the sun beat down. The band leader stamped time with a swagger stick under his arm.</p> \n<p>Watching from a high terrace was Esther Moyo. Twenty-nine years old, hungry, poor, she was not impressed. \u201cMugabe is the reason we are in this mess,\u201d she railed. \u201cI just came here to sell my snacks to make a living \u2026 and to make sure the old man was really dead.\u201d</p>",

Isolated from the west and much of the international community, Mugabe and his officials turned increasingly to a new coalition of allies and collaborators: the Kabila family in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Theodore Obiang of Equatorial Guinea, China, Russia and Cuba. Obiang, 77, was the first to address the thin crowds seeking the shade on the stadium\u2019s terraces on Saturday. The veteran ruler, whose country is mired in poverty despite its vast oil riches, said Mugabe had joined a long list of \u201cliberation struggle leaders in Africa\u201d, including Nelson Mandela, and added that the funeral would give a \u201clasting sense of democracy to the policies and position of President Mnangagwa\u201d. This of course was a key reason for the pomp of the public ceremony: the line of soldiers, police and presidential guardsmen standing in the sun, the three-gun salute and the presence of all the foreign dignitaries. For Mnangagwa and those close to him \u2013 struggling with a deepening economic crisis, massive debts, continuing international isolation and significant domestic opposition to their rule \u2013 the death of Zimbabwe\u2019s former ruler was an opportunity to assume the role of legitimate successors to the \u201cfounder of the nation\u201d and to obscure the fact that Mugabe had no desire to leave power. But this proved harder to arrange than many within the deeply divided ruling party had clearly believed. Mugabe had made no secret of his bitterness, telling journalists at his last public appearance that he and his second wife, Grace, had been mistreated by the new rulers of the country. Grace, 54, refused to allow Mnangagwa to preside over a burial, and her late husband will now be interred in a month once a suitable tomb has been constructed at the monument reserved for \u201cnational heroes\u201d on a ridge overlooking Harare. A family representative, Walter Chidakwa, spoke to the crowds in the stadium on Saturday of the \u201cstrong views\u201d of Mugabe and his insistence on \u201cintegrity\u201d. Many took his words as an indirect reproach to Mnangagwa. \u201cOur father told us to be who you are,\u201d Chidakwa said. \u201cTowards the end of his life he was a sad man. A sad, sad, sad man. He recalled quietly the journey he had walked. A profound journey, a hard and excruciating journey.\u201d But if Mugabe has gone, his legacy remains. There is the crumbling infrastructure, soaring inflation and vast debts that have crippled the economy, leaving millions facing hunger. There is also the reflex authoritarianism and powerful security establishment that seeks to crush opposition. And there is the strategic alignment: envoys from Havana, Beijing and Moscow spoke attended the funeral, speaking more or less interchangeably of their loss of a great friend and ally, their unbreakable friendships with Zimbabwe and the injustice of the sanctions imposed on the country by the EU and the US during Mugabe\u2019s rule. When it was the current president\u2019s turn to address the crowd \u2013 which barely filled a quarter of the vast stadium \u2013 Mnangagwa spoke of his own desire to see \u201ca Zimbabwe free of the albatross of sanctions\u201d. There was little evidence of the fresh approach he promised in the runup to elections last year, other than the crowd of foreign journalists before the podium. International media had been almost entirely banned in recent years. \u201cIn many ways, Mugabe could have given that speech,\u201d said Blessing-Miles Tendi, an expert and author from Oxford University. \u201cThere were very familiar themes: sovereignty, sanctions, and no recognition of the failings of the government itself. The man is gone, but his ideas and methods live on.\u201d In a gesture that many praised, opposition leaders had been invited to the funeral, including some from the Movement for Democratic Change, which headed protests against Mugabe and suffered repeated waves of repression as a consequence. \u201cIn African culture you are bound to be present [at a funeral]. We are here for Mugabe, not for Mnangagwa or Zanu-PF,\u201d said Job Sikhala, an MDC parliamentarian, shortly before the ceremony. Sikhala, who is facing treason charges for his political activities and a potentially heavy prison term, said Mugabe\u2019s pan-African ideology might have brought the late ruler admirers across the continent but was an anachronism. \u201cColonialism left its pains and scars \u2026 but we believe that 40 years after independence there is no point in crying over spilt milk. Africa needs its own solutions.\u201d The speeches went on. Any early excitement ebbed. The flow of supporters into the stadium began to reverse. The guns fired their salute and 95 doves were released into the air. The presidential guard \u2013 blamed for the shooting of six civilians days after the elections last year \u2013 huddled around the casket. Grace Mugabe, her face veiled, her robes black, stood and watched. The soldiers lifted and began a slow, steady march out of the stadium followed by the bereaved family, the president, ministers, a large number of senior soldiers in diverse uniforms with braid and medals, and, after some time, the foreign dignitaries. The band thumped and blared and the sun beat down. The band leader stamped time with a swagger stick under his arm. Watching from a high terrace was Esther Moyo. Twenty-nine years old, hungry, poor, she was not impressed. \u201cMugabe is the reason we are in this mess,\u201d she railed. \u201cI just came here to sell my snacks to make a living \u2026 and to make sure the old man was really dead.\u201d",

In-work households made up 31% of cases in south-east England and 30% in London and the east of England, compared to just 17% in the north east, where housing is cheaper.

The figures are based only on the employment status of the household member who applied for support \u2013 so if the applicant was unemployed but another household member was in work, the government data will not pick this up.

      "bodyText": "Tuberculosis levels in cattle have risen in the original two areas of the country where the badger cull has been piloted over the past five years, raising questions about the merit of expanding the scheme. The figures are confirmed in official data quietly released last week as the government announced plans to expand the controversial cull in England, which campaigners say could see more than 60,000 badgers killed this year. The figures suggest that, following some early success in bringing the levels down, bovine TB is now on the rise in the zones, in Gloucestershire and Somerset. Analysis by the vet and former government scientist Dr Iain McGill, who led calls for a public inquiry into the BSE scandal, reveals that the proportion of herds with bovine TB in the Gloucestershire pilot zone increased from 6.9% at the start of culling to 9% over the five-year period. The rate of occurrence of new confirmed bovine TB cases \u2013 known as the incidence rate \u2013 was 13.2% last year, compared with 12.7% when the cull began in 2013. In Somerset, the incidence rate declined, but the disease has become more widespread across herds.

A French court ruled that a man who died from a heart attack after having adulterous sex during a work trip had suffered a \u201cworkplace accident\u201d. While his employers argued that the man (\u201cXavier X\u201d) interrupted work for the rendezvous, it was decided that sex was part of everyday life, \u201clike having a shower or a meal\u201d. Therefore, crucially, the worker\u2019s family would receive a better pension and other help.</p> <p>France isn\u2019t the only country to define workplace accidents as anything that happens during a work trip, though all I can find for the UK are photos of people falling off ladders or lying under boxes. With due respect, Xavier appears to have raised the stakes on the definition of \u201cwork-related\u201d. Meanwhile, British people on business trips worry about putting a Toblerone from the minibar on expenses.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to imagine a journalist having such a work-related accident or indulging in anything but exemplary behaviour, but this makes a funny kind of sense. Certainly, it fits the standard British cultural characterisation of the French \u2013 the sophistication, the sang-froid regarding <em>les affaires d\u2019amour</em>\u2026 and now the adulterous bunk-ups as part of the normal working day.

While his employers argued that the man (\u201cXavier X\u201d) interrupted work for the rendezvous, it was decided that sex was part of everyday life, \u201clike having a shower or a meal\u201d. Therefore, crucially, the worker\u2019s family would receive a better pension and other help. France isn\u2019t the only country to define workplace accidents as anything that happens during a work trip, though all I can find for the UK are photos of people falling off ladders or lying under boxes. With due respect, Xavier appears to have raised the stakes on the definition of \u201cwork-related\u201d. Meanwhile, British people on business trips worry about putting a Toblerone from the minibar on expenses. It\u2019s difficult to imagine a journalist having such a work-related accident or indulging in anything but exemplary behaviour, but this makes a funny kind of sense. Certainly, it fits the standard British cultural characterisation of the French \u2013 the sophistication, the sang-froid regarding les affaires d\u2019amour\u2026 and now the adulterous bunk-ups as part of the normal working day. Quelle surprise, right? \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

His clothes \u2013 black T-shirt, shorts and Nikes \u2013 are both less strange and less \u2018fashion\u2019 than you\u2019d expect. He has no idea how the photographs will turn out, but he is already toying with Avedon-style scenarios to create a world and coax performances from the models. \u201cThis afternoon there will be a bunch of balloons being sold and they are going to be floating around and someone\u2019s bought a balloon and a child is taking them away,\u201d he muses, as we head downstairs to a caf\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019d never talk to someone and say, \u2018Stand here, face the light, pose like this\u2026\u2019\u201d Walker pauses, making his point explicit: \u201cSo yeah, I owe everything to Avedon.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Looking at Walker\u2019s </strong></em>portfolio, you\u2019d assume he could only have survived a disturbed, deranged childhood. Except, really, it sounds like it couldn\u2019t have been more idyllic. He was born in Guildford, Surrey, but when he and his brother were little, his parents moved to an isolated spot in rural Dorset. Their summers were spent jumping fences, building tree houses and trying to dam the little river that flowed through their valley so that they could swim in it. \u201cNot that my upbringing is any better than anyone else\u2019s,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I know the privilege of growing up feral, being allowed to run around gave me a lot of what I draw on now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d1c5d36dba36077b061dfc3442151eb39ecdf2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d1c5d36dba36077b061dfc3442151eb39ecdf2e/77_146_3415_4187/816.jpg\" alt=\"Stella Tennant in Dior Haute Couture dress, \u2018Japonais\u2019, London, 2016.\" width=\"816\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stella Tennant in Dior Haute Couture dress, \u2018Japonais\u2019, London, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Walker/Tim Walker Studio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Walker wasn\u2019t mucking about outside with his brother, he was drawing. \u201cCartoons or cartoonesque figures, extreme,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019d be drawing an extremely tall person with very, very long hair, or I\u2019d be drawing a very round person, or a very black person, a very white person, a very pink or green person. It was sort of a Mr Men language that I\u2019m still doing in a way. There\u2019s an extremity to my interest in beauty.\u201d</p> <p>Walker is that rare photographer who doesn\u2019t post images to Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with people looking at technology too much, because it takes you out of reality in a relentless, needy way,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think just looking at images all in one size makes everything very linear. There\u2019s a great joy of encountering an enormous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/wolfgang-tillmans\" title=\"\">Wolfgang Tillmans</a> print he\u2019s just stuck up with a nail on a wall in the Tate, then looking at a tiny <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/20/cecil-beaton-exhibition-put-spotlight-bright-young-things-national-portrait-gallery\" title=\"\">Cecil Beaton</a> in the National Portrait Gallery taken in the 1930s, then opening up the <em>Sunday Times</em> and seeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/don-mccullin\" title=\"\">Don McCullin\u2019s</a> pictures. Instagram is scary. Be careful. <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>.\u201d</p> <p>After school, Walker spent a few months cataloguing the Cecil Beaton archive at magazine publishing house Cond\u00e9 Nast in London, followed by art school in Exeter. Being given the boot by Avedon during a year in New York didn\u2019t derail his career, in fact the opposite: aged 25, back in the UK, he received his first commission for <em>Vogue</em> (a relationship that continues to this day). Walker soon became the go-to for high-concept fashion shoots, often in collaboration with the set designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2013/aug/16/shona-heath-j-crew-set-designer\" title=\"\">Shona Heath</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e01da4d5f9edf23b57d7b04dde774faa4dc742ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e01da4d5f9edf23b57d7b04dde774faa4dc742ba/0_296_5212_3128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cate Blanchett skiing on the moon, Comme des Garc\u0327ons &amp; Julien d\u2019Ys, Paris, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cate Blanchett skiing on the moon, Comme des Garc\u0327ons &amp; Julien d\u2019Ys, Paris, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Walker/Tim Walker Studio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A turning-point, though, came in 2009 when Walker was asked by <em>Vogue</em> to photograph the designer Alexander McQueen. Walker was on a roll before the shoot: the previous year, he\u2019d staged his first major solo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jun/12/bestshot.tim.walker\" title=\"\">exhibition</a> at the Design Museum, and he had recently been honoured with an Infinity Award from the International Centre of Photography in New York. For McQueen, he sourced a skull and asked the set designer Andy Hillman to make a bow tie out of bones that McQueen would wear.</p> <p>The problem was that McQueen didn\u2019t want to wear the bow tie and he didn\u2019t want to put the skull on his head, as Walker envisioned. There was an awkward impasse. But then McQueen popped a cigarette in the mouth of the skull, now perched on the table in front of him. He lit another for himself. The <a href=\"https://www.timwalkerphotography.com/portraits#50\" title=\"\">portrait</a> would become one of Walker\u2019s most famous, and an iconic image of McQueen, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/11/alexander-mcqueen-obituary\" title=\"\">killed himself</a> the following year.</p> <p>\u201cMcQueen taking control of that sitting taught me the importance of the subject owning their photograph,\u201d says Walker now. \u201cSo I am very into all creative people who I work with, whether it\u2019s Fredrik Tj\u00e6randsen or McQueen, I want them to own and enjoy and exist within their photograph.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e4ae81772ce5756a2af7eda9fd284bb4f5a04a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e4ae81772ce5756a2af7eda9fd284bb4f5a04a6/0_193_3600_4135/871.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Moss, Chanel boxes and a Coca- Cola, Chanel Haute Couture, The Ritz, Paris, 2012.\" width=\"871\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Moss, Chanel boxes and a Coca- Cola, Chanel Haute Couture, The Ritz, Paris, 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Walker/Tim Walker Studio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walker insists that inspiration for his unhinged dreamscapes comes from \u201cthe same place it does for you and everyone\u201d. He goes on, \u201cI look at television, I read, I look at <em>National Geographic</em>, at newspapers, at documentary photography, at fashion photography, at cinema, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-fassbender\" title=\"\">Fassbinder\u2019s films</a>, I look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/27/james-ivory-ismail-merchant-love-secret-call-me-by-your-name-nudity\" title=\"\">Merchant Ivory</a> films\u2026 Anything that any one of us has seen \u2013 high, low, mid \u2013 and then I mix it all up.\u201d</p> <p>His best ideas come when he is daydreaming: cycling through Victoria Park, near where he lives, swimming in the Olympic pool in Stratford, walking the dog. A few years ago Walker photographed the director <a href=\"https://www.timwalkerphotography.com/portraits#8\" title=\"\">David Lynch</a>, who explained his weirdest thoughts came after he had been doing transcendental meditation. \u201cIt was a state that sends up so much creativity for him,\u201d says Walker. \u201cSo I learned how to meditate transcendentally.\u201d He breaks into a broad grin, flashing a gold tooth, \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t really give me a lot!\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Walker was approached</strong></em> by the V&amp;A back in 2016 about doing an exhibition that looked back at his career in the fashion industry, but also included new, specially commissioned work. It was a huge honour for the photographer, but perhaps an equally outsized gamble for the museum.</p> <p>\u201cIt is rare for the V&amp;A to give an exhibition of this scale to a photographer so young,\u201d admitted Susanna Brown, the V&amp;A\u2019s curator of photography, at the launch in March. \u201cBut I feel he has achieved so much over the last 25 years. His work speaks to so many people.\u201d The invitation came at a perfect time for Walker. The commissions from magazines and brands have never stopped rolling in, but he was finding himself disenchanted with the fashion world. There are some exceptions \u2013 the <em>Vogue</em> editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/edward-enninful\" title=\"\">Edward Enninful</a>, for example, is a friend and Walker credits him with \u201cde-stagnating\u201d what we think of model beauty \u2013 but the industry was leaving him cold. \u201cIt\u2019s isolated figures making a lot of money and creating very banal work,\u201d he says. \u201cArtistry is at a premium.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside a more conventional retrospective of 100 or so images in a white room, the V&amp;A asked Walker to explore their archives, which contain some 2.3m objects spanning 5,000 years of human creativity, and select 10 items that excited him. He would then make new photographic projects based around each of those. \u201cI spent a year opening boxes and speaking with each archivist at the V&amp;A,\u201d says Walker. The objects he picked include a manuscript made for the Duchess of Brittany in the 1470s, illustrations by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/07/tate-aubrey-beardsley-2020-plans-erections-buttocks-beheadings-blockbuster\" title=\"\">Aubrey Beardsley</a> and a dress from McQueen\u2019s 2009 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/08/why-mad-again-about-alexander-mcqueen-nick-waplington-savage-beauty\" title=\"\">Horn of Plenty</a> collection. The photographs, alongside the objects that inspired them, will be displayed in room sets created by Shona Heath \u2013 think a burned-out cathedral or an opulent country house \u2013 so you will feel like you have stumbled into one of Walker\u2019s photographs.</p> <p>\u201cThe best thing about the V&amp;A project is that it\u2019s a never-ending resource of inspiration,\u201d says Walker. \u201cAnd coming at that point in my life, it was like a feast! It\u2019s like when you suddenly discover a new restaurant and you\u2019re tasting flavours you\u2019ve never tasted before.\u201d Walker needs to go back to his shoot with the balloon dresses. After today, three years of work on the V&amp;A show will be complete. As for what happens next, he\u2019s not sure. As much as Avedon remains a touchstone, Walker is less interested in emulating his ferocious work ethic. He has a newish boyfriend and he likes being one step removed from the fashion world. \u201cI feel sorry for Dick,\u201d says Walker. \u201cHe was brilliant, but I don\u2019t know how much fun he had. Working with him was very, very hard, like being in the army. Every time he photographed, it was like going into war. Whereas I\u2019m trying to have a nourishing life and also hopefully make some memorable photographs. But if it doesn\u2019t happen, it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s also the fact that magazines are shuttering at an alarming rate. \u201cIt\u2019s undeniably the death of print media and where does that leave culture?\u201d he says. \u201cI grew up wanting to see photographs that I make on the printed page, so it\u2019s quite an interesting time to stop and take stock and decide where I could go next.\u201d Does that mean Walker might stop taking photographs then? \u201cI just need six months off,\u201d he replies, gnomically. \u201cAnd when I say time out, not really, because I\u2019m going to be reading, watching, looking.\u201d He smiles, \u201cI\u2019ll still be the same old voyeur.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/tim-walker\" title=\"\">Tim Walker: Wonderful Things</a> is on at the V&amp;A from 21 September to 8 March</em><em> 2020.

He has no idea how the photographs will turn out, but he is already toying with Avedon-style scenarios to create a world and coax performances from the models. \u201cThis afternoon there will be a bunch of balloons being sold and they are going to be floating around and someone\u2019s bought a balloon and a child is taking them away,\u201d he muses, as we head downstairs to a caf\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019d never talk to someone and say, \u2018Stand here, face the light, pose like this\u2026\u2019\u201d Walker pauses, making his point explicit: \u201cSo yeah, I owe everything to Avedon.\u201d Looking at Walker\u2019s portfolio, you\u2019d assume he could only have survived a disturbed, deranged childhood. Except, really, it sounds like it couldn\u2019t have been more idyllic. He was born in Guildford, Surrey, but when he and his brother were little, his parents moved to an isolated spot in rural Dorset. Their summers were spent jumping fences, building tree houses and trying to dam the little river that flowed through their valley so that they could swim in it. \u201cNot that my upbringing is any better than anyone else\u2019s,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I know the privilege of growing up feral, being allowed to run around gave me a lot of what I draw on now.\u201d When Walker wasn\u2019t mucking about outside with his brother, he was drawing. \u201cCartoons or cartoonesque figures, extreme,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019d be drawing an extremely tall person with very, very long hair, or I\u2019d be drawing a very round person, or a very black person, a very white person, a very pink or green person. It was sort of a Mr Men language that I\u2019m still doing in a way. There\u2019s an extremity to my interest in beauty.\u201d Walker is that rare photographer who doesn\u2019t post images to Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with people looking at technology too much, because it takes you out of reality in a relentless, needy way,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think just looking at images all in one size makes everything very linear. There\u2019s a great joy of encountering an enormous Wolfgang Tillmans print he\u2019s just stuck up with a nail on a wall in the Tate, then looking at a tiny Cecil Beaton in the National Portrait Gallery taken in the 1930s, then opening up the Sunday Times and seeing Don McCullin\u2019s pictures. Instagram is scary. Be careful. Nineteen Eighty-Four.\u201d After school, Walker spent a few months cataloguing the Cecil Beaton archive at magazine publishing house Cond\u00e9 Nast in London, followed by art school in Exeter. Being given the boot by Avedon during a year in New York didn\u2019t derail his career, in fact the opposite: aged 25, back in the UK, he received his first commission for Vogue (a relationship that continues to this day). Walker soon became the go-to for high-concept fashion shoots, often in collaboration with the set designer Shona Heath. A turning-point, though, came in 2009 when Walker was asked by Vogue to photograph the designer Alexander McQueen. Walker was on a roll before the shoot: the previous year, he\u2019d staged his first major solo exhibition at the Design Museum, and he had recently been honoured with an Infinity Award from the International Centre of Photography in New York. For McQueen, he sourced a skull and asked the set designer Andy Hillman to make a bow tie out of bones that McQueen would wear. The problem was that McQueen didn\u2019t want to wear the bow tie and he didn\u2019t want to put the skull on his head, as Walker envisioned. There was an awkward impasse. But then McQueen popped a cigarette in the mouth of the skull, now perched on the table in front of him. He lit another for himself. The portrait would become one of Walker\u2019s most famous, and an iconic image of McQueen, who killed himself the following year. \u201cMcQueen taking control of that sitting taught me the importance of the subject owning their photograph,\u201d says Walker now. \u201cSo I am very into all creative people who I work with, whether it\u2019s Fredrik Tj\u00e6randsen or McQueen, I want them to own and enjoy and exist within their photograph.\u201d Walker insists that inspiration for his unhinged dreamscapes comes from \u201cthe same place it does for you and everyone\u201d. He goes on, \u201cI look at television, I read, I look at National Geographic, at newspapers, at documentary photography, at fashion photography, at cinema, at Fassbinder\u2019s films, I look at Merchant Ivory films\u2026 Anything that any one of us has seen \u2013 high, low, mid \u2013 and then I mix it all up.\u201d His best ideas come when he is daydreaming: cycling through Victoria Park, near where he lives, swimming in the Olympic pool in Stratford, walking the dog. A few years ago Walker photographed the director David Lynch, who explained his weirdest thoughts came after he had been doing transcendental meditation. \u201cIt was a state that sends up so much creativity for him,\u201d says Walker. \u201cSo I learned how to meditate transcendentally.\u201d He breaks into a broad grin, flashing a gold tooth, \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t really give me a lot!\u201d Walker was approached by the V&amp;A back in 2016 about doing an exhibition that looked back at his career in the fashion industry, but also included new, specially commissioned work. It was a huge honour for the photographer, but perhaps an equally outsized gamble for the museum. \u201cIt is rare for the V&amp;A to give an exhibition of this scale to a photographer so young,\u201d admitted Susanna Brown, the V&amp;A\u2019s curator of photography, at the launch in March. \u201cBut I feel he has achieved so much over the last 25 years. His work speaks to so many people.\u201d The invitation came at a perfect time for Walker. The commissions from magazines and brands have never stopped rolling in, but he was finding himself disenchanted with the fashion world. There are some exceptions \u2013 the Vogue editor Edward Enninful, for example, is a friend and Walker credits him with \u201cde-stagnating\u201d what we think of model beauty \u2013 but the industry was leaving him cold. \u201cIt\u2019s isolated figures making a lot of money and creating very banal work,\u201d he says. \u201cArtistry is at a premium.\u201d Alongside a more conventional retrospective of 100 or so images in a white room, the V&amp;A asked Walker to explore their archives, which contain some 2.3m objects spanning 5,000 years of human creativity, and select 10 items that excited him. He would then make new photographic projects based around each of those. \u201cI spent a year opening boxes and speaking with each archivist at the V&amp;A,\u201d says Walker. The objects he picked include a manuscript made for the Duchess of Brittany in the 1470s, illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley and a dress from McQueen\u2019s 2009 Horn of Plenty collection. The photographs, alongside the objects that inspired them, will be displayed in room sets created by Shona Heath \u2013 think a burned-out cathedral or an opulent country house \u2013 so you will feel like you have stumbled into one of Walker\u2019s photographs. \u201cThe best thing about the V&amp;A project is that it\u2019s a never-ending resource of inspiration,\u201d says Walker. \u201cAnd coming at that point in my life, it was like a feast! It\u2019s like when you suddenly discover a new restaurant and you\u2019re tasting flavours you\u2019ve never tasted before.\u201d Walker needs to go back to his shoot with the balloon dresses. After today, three years of work on the V&amp;A show will be complete. As for what happens next, he\u2019s not sure. As much as Avedon remains a touchstone, Walker is less interested in emulating his ferocious work ethic. He has a newish boyfriend and he likes being one step removed from the fashion world. \u201cI feel sorry for Dick,\u201d says Walker. \u201cHe was brilliant, but I don\u2019t know how much fun he had. Working with him was very, very hard, like being in the army. Every time he photographed, it was like going into war. Whereas I\u2019m trying to have a nourishing life and also hopefully make some memorable photographs. But if it doesn\u2019t happen, it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d There\u2019s also the fact that magazines are shuttering at an alarming rate. \u201cIt\u2019s undeniably the death of print media and where does that leave culture?\u201d he says. \u201cI grew up wanting to see photographs that I make on the printed page, so it\u2019s quite an interesting time to stop and take stock and decide where I could go next.\u201d Does that mean Walker might stop taking photographs then? \u201cI just need six months off,\u201d he replies, gnomically. \u201cAnd when I say time out, not really, because I\u2019m going to be reading, watching, looking.\u201d He smiles, \u201cI\u2019ll still be the same old voyeur.\u201d Tim Walker: Wonderful Things is on at the V&amp;A from 21 September to 8 March 2020.

He worked for the <em>London Review of Books</em> and the <em>Independent on Sunday</em> before moving to Italy in 1999. He published <em>The Dark Heart of Italy</em> in 2003 and has written three detective novels set in Italy. He returned to Somerset for 14 years to co-found Windsor Hill Wood offering sanctuary to people in crisis (the subject of his 2015 book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/02/a-place-of-refuge-an-experiment-in-communal-living-the-story-of-windsor-hill-wood-tobias-jones-revie\" title=\"\">A Place of Refuge</a></em>).

His latest book is <em>Ultra: The Underworld of Italian Football.</em></p> <p><strong>What got you interested in the ultras</strong><strong>?</strong><br>I\u2019ve always been fascinated by subcultures and I\u2019ve always been a football nut.

      "bodyText": "Tobias Jones was born in Somerset and educated at Oxford University. He worked for the London Review of Books and the Independent on Sunday before moving to Italy in 1999. He published The Dark Heart of Italy in 2003 and has written three detective novels set in Italy. He returned to Somerset for 14 years to co-found Windsor Hill Wood offering sanctuary to people in crisis (the subject of his 2015 book A Place of Refuge). In 2017 Jones moved back to Parma, where he lives with his wife Francesca and three children. His latest book is Ultra: The Underworld of Italian Football. What got you interested in the ultras? I\u2019ve always been fascinated by subcultures and I\u2019ve always been a football nut.

While that line rings ridiculous in non-Lib Dem ears, it generates plenty of applause from activists intoxicated by the party\u2019s recent successes and the swelling of their membership to more than 120,000.

The increase in the contingent of Lib Dem MPs is the least important consequence of his switch. It is the signal that it sends to the electorate that really matters. The defection of liberal Tories such as Mr Gyimah and Sarah Wollaston sends a message to moderate Conservative voters that they ought to be making the same journey to the Lib Dems.

A lot will depend on Ms Swinson, who might be well known among dedicated Lib Dems, but is still introducing herself to the electorate. Not yet 40, she offers some obvious differentiation to the fiftysomething and seventysomething men who lead what we used to call the two main parties. One of her colleagues calls Ms Swinson \u201cthe wild card\u201d of the looming election. A senior figure on Labour\u2019s frontbench agrees, describing her as \u201cthe unknown quantity\u201d among the party leaders. The voters are already well acquainted with Boris Johnson. In Jeremy Corbyn, Labour also has a highly polarising leader about whom opinions are fixed. Nigel Farage and Nicola Sturgeon don\u2019t need any further introduction. Views of these personalities may flux a bit during an election campaign, but how they are perceived is not likely to be altered fundamentally. By contrast, Ms Swinson is still a blank page as far as most of the electorate is concerned.</p> <p>Her party\u2019s fortunes will be highly contingent on how she performs in an election campaign and no one can be sure about that until she is put to the test in that hot crucible of character. Tim Farron was thought to be a good campaigner when he became Lib Dem leader, but he sank their 2017 election effort when all the party\u2019s messages were drowned out by questions about his attitudes towards gay marriage. Nick Clegg took everyone by surprise with the strength of his showing during the 2010 campaign. Hard though it is to believe now, there was a brief period when people talked about \u201cCleggmania\u201d and one daft newspaper headline even suggested that he had become nearly as popular as Winston Churchill at the war leader\u2019s zenith.</p> <p>Ms Swinson secured the party leadership by a large margin in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/22/jo-swinson-elected-new-lib-dem-leader\" title=\"\"> July</a>, but there is a vast difference between pleasing Lib Dem activists and connecting with the wider country. The next election will not be just about Europe. Many voters will have other issues on their minds. We don\u2019t know yet whether she has the skill to fashion an attractive pitch for her party that is broader than its opposition to Brexit. We will get some measure of whether she has what it takes from her conference speech.</p> <p>We may also get a firmer idea about the extent of Lib Dem ambitions. Always outspent by Labour and the Tories at elections, they have a difficult choice to make about how high to aim. The cautious in their ranks argue that the party must be realistic about how many seats it can take off other parties and should concentrate its limited resources on their most plausible prospects. The bolder contend that they ought to risk spreading their resources more widely by pursuing an ambition to secure as many as 100 MPs.</p> <p>They will need to prepare their defences against a big squeeze by the Tories and Labour. Both will try to turn the election into a binary choice between the two of them. Labour\u2019s tortured transition towards being a pro-referendum party will not be very convincing so long as its leader still refuses to say whether or not Labour is now a Remain party, but Labour hopes to recoup some of the anti-Brexit voters who have migrated away from them to the Lib Dems. Ms Swinson is responding by trying to sharpen the difference with Labour. She will ask the conference to endorse a new policy, namely that a majority Lib Dem government would reverse Brexit by revoking article 50 without another referendum. This sounds fantastical, anti-democratic and a gamble. There will be fervent Remainers who feel exceedingly queasy about overturning the 2016 referendum without holding another one.</p> <p>Both Labour and the Tories fear a strong Lib Dem performance, but it is the Conservatives who probably have most to lose in terms of MPs. Of the Lib Dems\u2019 top 50 target seats, only seven are represented by Labour. The great majority of those target seats are Tory held.</p> <p>One Conservative counter will be to attempt to turn the election into an extremely presidential contest, a Johnson versus Corbyn face-off, in the belief that this will best exploit the Tory leader\u2019s superior leadership ratings. The Conservatives will tell the Corbyn-averse that a vote for the Lib Dems will risk putting him into Number 10. The Lib Dems have recent experience of how damaging this can be. David Cameron cannibalised a lot of their support at the 2015 election by shivering the spines of Tory/Lib Dem swing voters with the spectre that a vote for the Lib Dems could send Ed Miliband to Downing Street at the head of \u201ca coalition of chaos\u201d. That slogan has not aged well, given the mayhem that the Tories have inflicted on Britain in the years since, but fear of a repeat haunts the Lib Dems to this day. This explains why Ms Swinson is so adamantine about ruling out a post-election coalition with Labour for so long as it is led by Mr Corbyn, a man she calls \u201cunfit to be prime minister\u201d. It also explains why she was so brusquely dismissive over the summer when it was suggested that the Labour leader should be made a temporary prime minister to block a no-deal Brexit. The Lib Dems have many reasons for sending a clear message that they will not ease Mr Corbyn\u2019s way into Downing Street. One of the most important is that it would set up the Tories to campaign on the slogan: \u201cVote Swinson, Get Corbyn.\u201d</p> <p>The latest defection to their ranks will embolden optimistic Lib Dems to think that we are on the cusp of a big realignment of our politics, the breaking of the blue-red duopoly that has controlled Britain for decades. The allegiance-smashing forces unleashed by Brexit certainly seem to have created the most promising outlook in decades. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/13/jo-swinson-corbyn-and-johnson-are-unfit-to-lead-country\" title=\"\">Ms Swinson likes to think so</a>, saying that \u201cthe faultline in British politics is no longer a left-right divide... now [it] is between liberal and authoritarian values\u201d.</p> <p>I am old enough to recall Paddy Ashdown saying similar things back in the 1990s only for the big old beasts of blue and red to recover and reassert their dominance. The truth is we just don\u2019t know yet. That question is far too large to be answered during a few days by the seaside. What we might get is some clues about whether the Lib Dems are really up to grasping their opportunities.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

In Jeremy Corbyn, Labour also has a highly polarising leader about whom opinions are fixed. Nigel Farage and Nicola Sturgeon don\u2019t need any further introduction. Views of these personalities may flux a bit during an election campaign, but how they are perceived is not likely to be altered fundamentally. By contrast, Ms Swinson is still a blank page as far as most of the electorate is concerned. Her party\u2019s fortunes will be highly contingent on how she performs in an election campaign and no one can be sure about that until she is put to the test in that hot crucible of character. Tim Farron was thought to be a good campaigner when he became Lib Dem leader, but he sank their 2017 election effort when all the party\u2019s messages were drowned out by questions about his attitudes towards gay marriage. Nick Clegg took everyone by surprise with the strength of his showing during the 2010 campaign. Hard though it is to believe now, there was a brief period when people talked about \u201cCleggmania\u201d and one daft newspaper headline even suggested that he had become nearly as popular as Winston Churchill at the war leader\u2019s zenith. Ms Swinson secured the party leadership by a large margin in July, but there is a vast difference between pleasing Lib Dem activists and connecting with the wider country. The next election will not be just about Europe. Many voters will have other issues on their minds. We don\u2019t know yet whether she has the skill to fashion an attractive pitch for her party that is broader than its opposition to Brexit. We will get some measure of whether she has what it takes from her conference speech. We may also get a firmer idea about the extent of Lib Dem ambitions. Always outspent by Labour and the Tories at elections, they have a difficult choice to make about how high to aim. The cautious in their ranks argue that the party must be realistic about how many seats it can take off other parties and should concentrate its limited resources on their most plausible prospects. The bolder contend that they ought to risk spreading their resources more widely by pursuing an ambition to secure as many as 100 MPs. They will need to prepare their defences against a big squeeze by the Tories and Labour. Both will try to turn the election into a binary choice between the two of them. Labour\u2019s tortured transition towards being a pro-referendum party will not be very convincing so long as its leader still refuses to say whether or not Labour is now a Remain party, but Labour hopes to recoup some of the anti-Brexit voters who have migrated away from them to the Lib Dems. Ms Swinson is responding by trying to sharpen the difference with Labour. She will ask the conference to endorse a new policy, namely that a majority Lib Dem government would reverse Brexit by revoking article 50 without another referendum. This sounds fantastical, anti-democratic and a gamble. There will be fervent Remainers who feel exceedingly queasy about overturning the 2016 referendum without holding another one. Both Labour and the Tories fear a strong Lib Dem performance, but it is the Conservatives who probably have most to lose in terms of MPs. Of the Lib Dems\u2019 top 50 target seats, only seven are represented by Labour. The great majority of those target seats are Tory held. One Conservative counter will be to attempt to turn the election into an extremely presidential contest, a Johnson versus Corbyn face-off, in the belief that this will best exploit the Tory leader\u2019s superior leadership ratings. The Conservatives will tell the Corbyn-averse that a vote for the Lib Dems will risk putting him into Number 10. The Lib Dems have recent experience of how damaging this can be. David Cameron cannibalised a lot of their support at the 2015 election by shivering the spines of Tory/Lib Dem swing voters with the spectre that a vote for the Lib Dems could send Ed Miliband to Downing Street at the head of \u201ca coalition of chaos\u201d. That slogan has not aged well, given the mayhem that the Tories have inflicted on Britain in the years since, but fear of a repeat haunts the Lib Dems to this day. This explains why Ms Swinson is so adamantine about ruling out a post-election coalition with Labour for so long as it is led by Mr Corbyn, a man she calls \u201cunfit to be prime minister\u201d. It also explains why she was so brusquely dismissive over the summer when it was suggested that the Labour leader should be made a temporary prime minister to block a no-deal Brexit. The Lib Dems have many reasons for sending a clear message that they will not ease Mr Corbyn\u2019s way into Downing Street. One of the most important is that it would set up the Tories to campaign on the slogan: \u201cVote Swinson, Get Corbyn.\u201d The latest defection to their ranks will embolden optimistic Lib Dems to think that we are on the cusp of a big realignment of our politics, the breaking of the blue-red duopoly that has controlled Britain for decades. The allegiance-smashing forces unleashed by Brexit certainly seem to have created the most promising outlook in decades. Ms Swinson likes to think so, saying that \u201cthe faultline in British politics is no longer a left-right divide... now [it] is between liberal and authoritarian values\u201d. I am old enough to recall Paddy Ashdown saying similar things back in the 1990s only for the big old beasts of blue and red to recover and reassert their dominance. The truth is we just don\u2019t know yet. That question is far too large to be answered during a few days by the seaside. What we might get is some clues about whether the Lib Dems are really up to grasping their opportunities. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

Conservative MPs who want another delay don\u2019t understand that this would probably destroy the Conservative party and put [Jeremy] Corbyn into No 10.\u201d Johnson took aim last night at opposition parties and the 21 rebel Tories who voted for the legislation to block no deal before being stripped of the party whip. In a statement, he told voters: \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by Corbyn and the ringleaders. On the one hand, they say I don\u2019t want a deal. On the other, they want to force me to extend. Both are wrong. I am straining to get a deal, but I will also end the uncertainty and take us out on 31 October.\u201d As the row escalated, Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said the prime minister should think carefully before pursuing an illegal strategy. \u201cIf Boris Johnson seeks to defy the law, then the consequences will be serious,\u201d he said. \u201cParliament has placed robust legal duties on Boris Johnson to secure an extension and stop a no-deal Brexit at the end of October. If the prime minister thinks parliament is going to stand by while he breaks the law, then he has another think coming.\u201d Johnson\u2019s attempt to frame the Brexit argument as one between obstructive MPs in parliament and the 17.4 million British people who voted to leave the EU now threatens to spiral into a confrontation involving the courts. Downing Street is, according to insiders, examining whether it can challenge in the courts the interpretation of the new legislation (the so-called Benn act) to block no deal and is looking for other ways to prevent Johnson having to seek an extension. On Saturday David Davis, a former Brexit secretary, said he believed there might well be a way \u201cto effectively legally kill off the Benn bill\u201d. Separately the supreme court will begin a joint hearing this week on whether the prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks until mid-October was lawful, after legal challenges in the English, Scottish and Northern Irish courts. While English and Northern Irish judges have ruled that the suspension of parliament was lawful, three Scottish appeal court judges concluded last week that the decision was unlawful, as suspension was clearly an attempt to \u201cstymie\u201d the House of Commons and prevent MPs from scrutinising the government over Brexit. A final supreme court ruling is expected this week or early next week. Joanna Cherry QC, the SNP MP who jointly led the successful legal challenge in Scotland, said she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the supreme court would follow the Scottish judges on the grounds that, while the courts cannot subject the executive to political scrutiny, they have a duty to ensure that the body charged with doing so \u2013 parliament \u2013 is able to perform that task. Downing Street said that David Frost was making good progress in talks with DUP leaders, which could lead to a breakthrough on the issue of the Irish border. While the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has denied that her party is shifting its position and would now be prepared to accept regulatory checks in the Irish Sea and some regulatory divergence from Britain \u2013 assuming there is consent from the provinces \u2013 Johnson\u2019s officials are determined to show that they are serious about avoiding a no deal. Speaking at a People\u2019s Vote rally in Belfast on Saturday, the former Tory MP and attorney general Dominic Grieve, one of the 21 Conservatives who lost the whip, said Brexit would harm the Northern Irish economy whatever deal was reached and, in turn, a border would endanger peace. \u201cWhether the rules in Northern Ireland follow those of the EU or those of the rest of the UK, one thing is certain \u2013 there will be an economic border placed in the way of business in Northern Ireland which does not exist today.\u201d In a sign of divisions in cabinet over Brexit on Saturday, culture secretary Nicky Morgan said that if there was a second referendum she would vote Remain. \u201cMy instincts are that I was sorry that the Remain campaign didn\u2019t win in 2016 and that really I\u2019m sorry that we\u2019ve seen all the division and uncertainty over the last three-and-a-half years,\u201d she told the BBC. She added she voted to stay in the EU \u201cfor the same reasons that I felt very firmly back in 2016 and I campaigned for Remain\u201d - which she said were both economic and geopolitical.",

      "body": "<p>In the Richard Curtis film <em>Notting Hill</em>, the bumbling stockbroker Bernie, played by Hugh Bonneville, meets Anna Scott, unaware that Julia Roberts\u2019s character is the world\u2019s most famous female actor.</p> <p>Upon learning her profession, he patronisingly commiserates with Anna about the low wages paid to actors, declaring them \u201ca scandal\u201d, and asks how much she received for her last movie. Without missing a beat, Anna replies \u201c$15m\u201d, the actual amount Roberts was paid to do the movie, a rare example of when an actress has earned more than her male counterpart \u2013 in this case, Hugh Grant. For a real scandal in acting has always been the huge gender pay gap.</p> <p>Now a team of economists has determined the width of that gap: male Hollywood stars earn $1.1m more per film than their similarly experienced female co-stars.</p> <p>Sofia Izquierdo Sanchez, of Huddersfield University, John S Heywood, of Wisconsin University, and Maria Navarro Paniagua, of Lancaster University, analysed the wages of 246 male and female actors who featured in 1,343 films between 1980 and 2015. \u201cThe gap has been quite persistent,\u201d Izquierdo Sanchez said. \u201cIt is almost the same in 2015 as it was in 1980. It doesn\u2019t show any signs of improving.\u201d</p> <p>Film data was mined from several sources, including the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com\" title=\"\">IMDb</a> and <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com\" title=\"\">Box Office Mojo</a> websites, which track box office revenues and carry the latest film news. The economists factored in several variables, including a star\u2019s past success based on box-office receipts, awards won and popularity on Twitter. When these factors were stripped out, it showed female stars were paid 56% less than their male counterparts \u2013 the equivalent of $2.2m less per film.</p> <p>\u201cWe were thinking that we would find a gap, because so many actresses have been bringing the issue up,\u201d Izquierdo Sanchez said. \u201cBut we were surprised to find so much of a gap, especially as we were talking about actors of the highest level, like Meryl Streep.\u201d</p> <p>Their work, presented at the annual congress of the European Economic Association in Manchester last month, found action films, which claimed seven of the top 10 worldwide grossing movies of 2018, were particularly poor at closing the gap: male stars were paid more than $1.8m more than female stars. The gap was present across all genres, even in romcoms, which Izquierdo Sanchez said was perplexing, given that \u201cactors and actresses should generally play similar levels and do exactly the same roles\u201d.</p> <p>The research also found the gap grew with age, something that Izquierdo Sanchez attributed to \u201cthe beauty value of the market\u201d. From childhood to middle age, it remained at about $1m, but when stars turned 50 it increased to an average of just under $4m per film.</p> <p>Izquierdo Sanchez said that as Hollywood was a \u201cbig cultural influence\u201d and an industry that employed more than two million people, the presence of a stubborn pay gap was troubling. \u201cIf it cannot be explained by the actors or actresses\u2019 performances or popularity, then the gap could, of course, be related to sexism,\u201d she said. However, the study also suggests that \u201cproducer bias cannot be completely eliminated as among the potential causes\u201d.</p> <p>The gender pay issue has become a major battleground, with leading actresses shaming the industry for its failure to take action.

      "bodyText": "In the Richard Curtis film Notting Hill, the bumbling stockbroker Bernie, played by Hugh Bonneville, meets Anna Scott, unaware that Julia Roberts\u2019s character is the world\u2019s most famous female actor. Upon learning her profession, he patronisingly commiserates with Anna about the low wages paid to actors, declaring them \u201ca scandal\u201d, and asks how much she received for her last movie. Without missing a beat, Anna replies \u201c$15m\u201d, the actual amount Roberts was paid to do the movie, a rare example of when an actress has earned more than her male counterpart \u2013 in this case, Hugh Grant. For a real scandal in acting has always been the huge gender pay gap. Now a team of economists has determined the width of that gap: male Hollywood stars earn $1.1m more per film than their similarly experienced female co-stars. Sofia Izquierdo Sanchez, of Huddersfield University, John S Heywood, of Wisconsin University, and Maria Navarro Paniagua, of Lancaster University, analysed the wages of 246 male and female actors who featured in 1,343 films between 1980 and 2015. \u201cThe gap has been quite persistent,\u201d Izquierdo Sanchez said. \u201cIt is almost the same in 2015 as it was in 1980. It doesn\u2019t show any signs of improving.\u201d Film data was mined from several sources, including the IMDb and Box Office Mojo websites, which track box office revenues and carry the latest film news. The economists factored in several variables, including a star\u2019s past success based on box-office receipts, awards won and popularity on Twitter. When these factors were stripped out, it showed female stars were paid 56% less than their male counterparts \u2013 the equivalent of $2.2m less per film. \u201cWe were thinking that we would find a gap, because so many actresses have been bringing the issue up,\u201d Izquierdo Sanchez said. \u201cBut we were surprised to find so much of a gap, especially as we were talking about actors of the highest level, like Meryl Streep.\u201d Their work, presented at the annual congress of the European Economic Association in Manchester last month, found action films, which claimed seven of the top 10 worldwide grossing movies of 2018, were particularly poor at closing the gap: male stars were paid more than $1.8m more than female stars. The gap was present across all genres, even in romcoms, which Izquierdo Sanchez said was perplexing, given that \u201cactors and actresses should generally play similar levels and do exactly the same roles\u201d. The research also found the gap grew with age, something that Izquierdo Sanchez attributed to \u201cthe beauty value of the market\u201d. From childhood to middle age, it remained at about $1m, but when stars turned 50 it increased to an average of just under $4m per film. Izquierdo Sanchez said that as Hollywood was a \u201cbig cultural influence\u201d and an industry that employed more than two million people, the presence of a stubborn pay gap was troubling. \u201cIf it cannot be explained by the actors or actresses\u2019 performances or popularity, then the gap could, of course, be related to sexism,\u201d she said. However, the study also suggests that \u201cproducer bias cannot be completely eliminated as among the potential causes\u201d. The gender pay issue has become a major battleground, with leading actresses shaming the industry for its failure to take action. Patricia Arquette made headlines in 2015 when, in her Oscars speech, she called for \u201cwage equality once and for all\u201d. A-listers including Streep, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Lawrence and Natalie Portman have also called for \u201cequal pay for an equal job\u201d. There was an outcry when Vanity Fair reported that, on the film American Hustle, the three main stars, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper and Amy Adams, each worked for similar amounts of time \u2013 about 45 days\u2019 filming. But while Bale and Cooper earned $2.5m each and commanded 9% of the profits, Adams earned $1.25m and 7% of the profits. The Forbes list of 2019\u2019s highest paid stars reveals Scarlett Johansson was paid $56m while Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson was paid $89.4m. The study\u2019s authors suggest one way to close the gap would be for stars\u2019 contracts to be made public, strengthening negotiating positions and highlighting poor levels of pay in the film industry, something even the comically ignorant Bernie appreciates. As he responds when Anna tells him that she was paid $15m for her last film: \u201cSo that\u2019s fairly good.\u201d",

Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan, an activist and poet who withdrew from the Bradford Literature festival in July after learning it was also funded by BSBT, describes the Home Office\u2019s practices as \u201cshadowy\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d. She said: \u201c[It matters] because not only our public institutions, but our media platforms, arts and culture events, civic life and social lives are being targeted at every level because we are Muslim. This is what decimates trust. Who and what are we supposed to trust for information or opinion or insight when our identities and experiences are being violently coopted and repackaged to us in the name of \u201cprotecting\u201d us? \u201cAt every level of every institution, the idea that Muslims are all at risk of perpetrating violence has been enshrined in the name of security and is causing the mass surveillance and targeting of us across the board. This is Orwellian.\u201d BSBT has awarded more than \u00a39m to organisations since 2015. The Home Office said: \u201cBSBT is an open and transparent programme, which supports local people in their vital work to bring communities together, promote fundamental values and tackle the spread of all extremist ideologies. \u201cThe Home Office has provided BSBT grant funding for the SuperSisters project since 2018 to provide support for Muslim women.\u201d \u2022 This article and its headline and subheading were amended on 18 September and 2 October 2019: to omit a suggestion that the Home Office funding was covert; and to refer to one employee and one recruit, not to two employees.",

      "body": "<p>Those of us lucky enough to read <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> back when it first appeared in 1985 will remember the shock of a novel that felt both claustrophobically precise and shatteringly prescient. The newly born Republic of Gilead, with its abuses and abominations, its hideously misogynistic vocabulary and gruesomely rationalised constraints, was just about far enough from our own world to seem beguiling, but also close enough to feel like a wake-up call.</p> <p>Still, no one could have guessed the extent to which recent history (as well as a superb <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/the-handmaid-s-tale--episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">TV offshoot</a>) would bring it eerily, terrifyingly back into focus. With the implacable rise of the Christian right in the US, never has it felt more urgent for women to guard both their bodies and their reproductive systems against (some) men and the state. Who, after all, is Donald Trump if not Commander Waterford without the charm? And I can\u2019t be the only one who, watching the Trump crowd\u2019s chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d or \u201cSend her back!\u201d, found herself thinking of taser-wielding Aunt Lydia and the handmaids\u2019 cries of \u201cHer fault!\u201d when one of their number \u201cconfesses\u201d to having been gang-raped?</p> <p>Given all of this history \u2013 and the fact that for 35 years fans have apparently been begging for answers to a host of Gilead-related questions \u2013 it\u2019s not surprising that <em>The Testaments</em> feels as eagerly awaited as a handmaid\u2019s bouncing baby. If ever a novelist could justify the spawning of a sequel, Atwood can.</p> <p>This novel opens 15 years after the end of the last book. Perhaps wisely, Atwood neatly leapfrogs the TV series \u2013 presumably leaving it open for several more seasons \u2013 while plucking just one significant detail from it: Baby Nicole. The \u201cchild\u201d of Commander Waterford and his wife (though in fact, as we all know, born of Offred/June and fathered by her lover, Nick), Nicole was smuggled into Canada as a baby and has not been seen since.</p> <p>This \u2013 together with the constant \u201cseepage\u201d of handmaids being helped to freedom by the so-called Underground Femaleroad \u2013 has not been good for Gilead, which has settled into an inevitable \u201cdog-eat-dog maturity\u201d. Meanwhile, a great deal of effort and espionage are going into tracking down missing Baby Nicole \u2013 now seen as the veritable \u201cposter child for Gilead\u201d \u2013 so that the republic can reclaim her as their own.</p> <p>The novel is narrated by three different female voices. The first belongs to Aunt Lydia herself, who is secretly writing her memoirs, apparently largely \u201cfor your edification, my unknown reader\u201d. The second is Agnes, a young woman who has grown up in Gilead and is being groomed (in both senses of the word) to marry a commander. The third, Daisy, is a feisty teenager living in Canada with two people who run a thrift store and whom she supposes to be her parents, except that something has always felt wrong: \u201cIt was like I was a prize cat they were cat-sitting.\u201d</p> <p>How these young women may or may not be connected \u2013 to one another and also, in Daisy\u2019s case, to Gilead \u2013 is one of the questions that drives the first hundred pages or so of the novel. Certainly, right from the start, Daisy lets slip that she discovered on her birthday that she was a \u201cfraud \u2013 a forgery done on purpose\u201d. And Agnes, who used to think she remembered nothing before the age of six or seven, realises she does have one \u201chazy memory of running through a forest with someone holding my hand\u201d. Aunt Lydia, meanwhile, who is \u201ceverywhere and nowhere\u201d, knows everything that they (and we) don\u2019t know. Atwood has always said that \u201cknowledge is power\u201d, but will Aunt Lydia use her power for good or evil?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Atwood challenges us to think and rethink, to see our volatile world anew</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What follows is a plump, pacy, witty and tightly plotted page-turner that transports us straight back to the dark heart of Gilead and seems to take great pleasure in providing answers to many of Atwood\u2019s readers\u2019 questions. If, for instance, you ever wondered why Aunt Lydia seems so willing to join the regime\u2019s monstrous attack on her own gender (despite a queasily hinted at softer side), here\u2019s her backstory. Similarly, the inner workings of Gilead are exposed in far more detail than in the first book and it\u2019s hardly surprising to learn that \u201cbeneath its outer show of virtue and purity\u201d the place is \u201crotting\u201d.</p> <p>What is surprising, though, given that so many of Atwood\u2019s actual details remain so gloriously dark (a paedophile dentist whose hand sits on a pubescent child\u2019s breast \u201clike a large hot crab\u201d is an image that won\u2019t leave me in a hurry), is that the story\u2019s outcomes are anything but. Perhaps Atwood has simply decided that Gilead\u2019s time is up \u2013 or maybe she\u2019s grown too fond of her characters to deny them happiness \u2013 but in so many startling ways this novel feels like a straight antidote to <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/01/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-sequel-the-testaments-profile\">Margaret Atwood: \u2018She\u2019s ahead of everyone in the room\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where the first book traded so pithily and memorably in obfuscation, despair and darkness, the sequel sees the lamps slowly lit. Where, at the end of the first, June was bundled into the back of a van with no idea whether it heralded her \u201cend\u201d or her \u201cbeginning\u201d, in this second novel we have a quasi-Shakespearean sense of all\u2019s well that ends well. Not only do various bad guys receive their comeuppance, but there\u2019s a strong sense of goodness winning the day, even \u2013 whisper it \u2013 hints of something that might amount to a happy ending.</p> <p>Which actually feels a touch disappointing. Sure, this new book is gloriously savage in its anger, against both God, with his \u201cspecial interest\u201d in the \u201cpolluting\u201d blood that comes out of girls, and sexually predatory men who prefer their underage victims to seem \u201cnot fully human, with a naughty core to them\u201d. There is no doubt that Atwood is on top form here. But still it feels as if something crucial is missing.</p> <p>Or perhaps not missing enough, for didn\u2019t the strength of the first book lie precisely in its daring ambiguities, its unapologetic refusal to elucidate? Surely one of the reasons Gilead managed to be so spookily convincing was that Atwood cunningly chose to leave so many of its edges blurry. Interiors, furniture, food, clothes, linen were described with all of the deft shadow and gleam of a Dutch painting \u2013 and the same, incidentally, is true in this book \u2013 but beyond that, we only had the vaguest hints of how the larger world worked. The most trenchant and exciting fiction almost always amounts to an act of conjuring \u2013 and in Atwood\u2019s gracefully necromantic hands, Gilead\u2019s regime didn\u2019t seem to require much explanation or justification. We believed, simple as that. And as for why Aunt Lydia behaves as she does? Well, have any of the world\u2019s most brutal regimes ever run short of compliant executioners?</p> <p>Another problem, which becomes more troubling as the novel unfolds, is the lack of emotional subtext,<strong> </strong>or indeed sometimes any subtext at all. In <em>The Testaments</em>, what you see is what you get, with any possibility of equivocation, shading or real complexity (or the chance for readers to imagine anything for themselves) sacrificed again and again to pace and plot. Perhaps the emphatically retrospective nature of this narrative doesn\u2019t help. <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> unfolded in a memorably deadpan and very immediate present tense \u2013 we didn\u2019t know what was coming next any more than June did. But here, because all three central characters are apparently giving their accounts as \u201cwitnesses\u201d, events unwind in the far less suspenseful and all-too hindsight-laden past.</p> <p>Perhaps because of this, there are few, if any, chances to feel moved on behalf of these characters \u2013 a strange and enervating absence in a novel that hinges so strongly on the agonies of familial separation. It made me wonder, not for the first time, whether this simply isn\u2019t where Atwood\u2019s interests lie: the only scene in <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> that, on a recent rereading, seemed less than entirely convincing is when June, finally shown a photograph of her daughter and unable to find any trace of her own existence in her child\u2019s eyes, wishes she hadn\u2019t seen it at all. (Believe me, no mother on Earth would pass up on that photo.)</p> <p>Where Atwood\u2019s interests do undeniably lie is in shaking us up, challenging our complacencies and using her chillingly profound imagination to challenge us to think and rethink, to see our volatile and increasingly toxic world anew. But is she willing to leave room for her reader? I have my own test of what makes a truly great work of fiction: can you revisit it at a later point in your life and read a whole different novel? In other words, is the novel sufficiently elastic \u2013 and slippery and enigmatic \u2013 to grow with you?</p> <p><em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> triumphantly passes this test. But occasionally, with its wide-angle sweep and wholehearted lack of uncertainty, its angels and demons struggle and seemingly effortless resolutions, <em>The Testaments</em> can feel as if it\u2019s already decided what it thinks. And what we should think, too.</p> <p><em>Julie Myerson\u2019s most recent novel is The Stopped Heart (Jonathan Cape). </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 The Testaments </em>by Margaret Atwood is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a320).

It is the great wake-up call of British art.</p> <p>But what does it mean, this spectacular engraving? Albion represents England (and primeval man) in the made-up mythologies of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/william-blake\" title=\"\">William Blake</a> (1757-1827). But many people believe this is not Albion so much as the personification of freedom, imagination, independence.

The son of a Soho shopkeeper who stumped up the money for drawing lessons and his son\u2019s apprenticeship to an engraver at 14, Blake studied for about a year at the Royal Academy. He learned to loathe the conformism of both the institution and its president, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Reynolds#Royal_Academy\" title=\"\">Joshua Reynolds</a>. There was only one show \u2013 an unqualified disaster held above the Soho shop, with not a work sold. All his life, Blake kept having to make engravings of other people\u2019s art.</p> <p>Except for the occasional hint of a Regency sideburn, however, his art reflects nothing of Georgian London. An <a href=\"http://bq.blakearchive.org/39.3.essick\" title=\"\">unconfirmed self-portrait</a> in the first gallery shows the artist with an intense but entirely in-turned gaze, plus that same startling symmetry that characterises so much of his work; images stream out of his mind, not in through his eyes.

Familiarity cannot diminish the utter singularity of his home-grown aesthetic: heads floating on columns of transparent Lycra-like material, rippling up towards multicoloured skies or gathering in tumultuous spirals. Saints diving through the firmament, devils flickering like fire, angels back-crawling through transparent seas. Lone bodies are shown in convulsion, drowning, paralysed or hunched tight as padlocks. Unbound, they appear spreadeagled, levitating, or hurtling upwards like the bellowed flames up a chimney.</p> <p>Moses holds up the tablets: a rocket man just about to lift off. Adam and Eve, with their high waists and Blake\u2019s weirdly pronounced muscle groups, perform a nude pas de deux. Men and women look alike, and both at times resemble a stylised version of his self-portrait, with its fixated eyes. Tulips make love, lovers couple inside flowers, fleas are reincarnated as titans. Newton does his pointless calculations \u2013 as if the world could possibly be measured \u2013 at the bottom of an inky blue sea.</p> <p>Could anyone, without benefit of scholarship, honestly interpret that marvellous icon as a diatribe against Newton and all his works? Can anyone really tell the difference between Blake\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.william-blake.org/The-Ancient-Of-Days.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Ancient of Days</em></a>, with his wind-blown beard and lightning-bolt dividers, and his doppelganger in the imaginary <em>The Book of Urizen</em>, representative of science and unfreedom? These visual archetypes appear interchangeable, evenly distributed across the moral spectrum. And walking through this immense show \u2013 300 works and more \u2013 it becomes obvious that good and evil may well have the same face or physique in Blake\u2019s conceit. After all, Lucifer eventually becomes Satan.</p> <p>In his visions, the devil may be tragic, tortured by interminable regret; and God may be violent, uprooting Adam like a weed from the earth. Horror is not always frightening. One illustration of hell shows a smoking serpent front of stage in a kind of glamorous limelight. <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/blake-cerberus-n03354\" title=\"\"><em>Cerberus</em></a> has at least one head resembling a London dog.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c7f65b291374bb21af0d2a97e3aa1942435516e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7f65b291374bb21af0d2a97e3aa1942435516e4/0_0_3148_2219/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cerberus, 1824-7.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cerberus, 1824-7.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This late ink and watercolour painting is unusually large for Blake, about the size of a hardback book.

A wild scrimmage of monkeys: evolution condensed. Infants so joyful they hover in the air like butterflies.

      "bodyText": "Since January 2016, when the head of Liberty University, Jerry Falwell Jr, endorsed Donald Trump for president, the influential evangelical university has been on a fast track to the heart of American politics. Since being credited with helping Trump earn the loyal support of the Christian right, Falwell has become a regular presence at the White House. Meanwhile, the university, founded in 1971 by his late father, the Rev Jerry Falwell Sr, has expanded exponentially.

But lately, a series of alleged scandals appear to be threatening Falwell\u2019s grip on power. And this week, the stakes were raised even higher amid accusations of corruption and Falwell\u2019s own demand for an FBI investigation. On Monday, Politico published a report, citing more than 24 current and former \u201chigh-ranking\u201d Liberty officials, which claims they are losing confidence in him. Falwell, it alleges, \u201cpresides over a culture of self-dealing, directing university resources into projects and real estate deals in which his friends and family have stood to make personal financial gains\u201d.

      "body": "<p>One summer\u2019s day 14 years ago, my husband and I and our then two-year-old daughter, Addie, took a fast train, a slow train, a bus and a car to get from Kyoto to a 400-person village called Omori, near the Sea of Japan about 70 miles north of Hiroshima. In a narrow valley amid forested hills, Omori had one main street, few cars and even fewer shops. Most of the people seemed to be around 60 or older and lived in wooden houses, some originally owned by samurai, with tiled roofs and sliding wooden doors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2019-09-11T16:47:46.html\" data-alt=\"Japan map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2019-09-11T16:47:46.html\">Japan map</a> </figure>  <p>Omori had once been famous for its nearby underground silver mine, Iwami Ginzan, which was open between 1526 and 1923 and a <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1246/\">Unesco world heritage site</a> since 2007. But by the time Tomi Matsuba and her husband, Daikichi, moved there in the early 1980s most of the homes sat empty. Daikichi\u2019s parents, who ran a kimono business there, encouraged Tomi and Daikichi to settle elsewhere. But the young couple had ideas about recapturing the beauty and pace of rural Japan by working with local artisans and farmers.</p> <p>When Tomi began to make clothes for her daughter, neighbours and friends asked her to do the same for them. Soon, Daikichi was selling the clothing at railway stations and department store events. Within a few years, the couple was turning down offers from big companies. Instead, they opened their own shop, which they called Gungendo, a word adapted from a Chinese proverb about people sharing their knowledge and opinions to work together.</p> <p>On my family\u2019s first trip to Omori, the shop had been open for several years and it was large and modern, with exposed wood and glass walls and a cafe that looked on to a garden. One room had shelves of handmade tea cups with ridges like sand, whimsical baby clothes and local jams and sauces. In another room hung women\u2019s cotton and linen skirts, shirts and pants, many of them designed by Tomi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8238c07f216d9a41c4338a0d1da5ae288d8598a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8238c07f216d9a41c4338a0d1da5ae288d8598a1/0_64_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rooms at Takyo Abeke retain the Edo style.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rooms at Takyo Abeke retain the Edo style.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Takyo Abeke</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And when we paid attention \u2013 and the Matsubas always encouraged people to slow down and pay attention \u2013 the shop offered little surprises everywhere. There was the tiny door to the garden only big enough for a child to fit through. In the bathroom, the stones gathered at the drain of the bathroom sink were so smooth I wanted to scoop them into my hands. And hidden among the garden\u2019s trees were two metal sculptures, made by a local artist known as Yoshida. Tall and round with amorphous faces and arms stretching toward the sky, they looked as if they might be friends with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/92a7Hj0ijLs\" title=\"\">Totoro</a>, from the popular animated tale.</p> <p>The most magical place, though, was the Matsubas\u2019 home, an Edo-period building that they had spent more than a decade restoring with materials from an old school and demolished houses, and even bits and pieces of wood they found on the street. A stone path, lined with a clan of Yoshida\u2019s sculptures, led to the entrance. Beyond the <em>noren</em> curtains, rooms flowed into other rooms, with <em>shoji</em> screen doors that opened on to porches and simple gardens. Along a pathway, woven wicker baskets hung from the walls. And in the gardens, stone sculptures peeked from the bushes.</p> <p>At night, Tomi invited us to take a bath in a handmade wooden tub that was so deep we could almost have swum. Next to it stood a stove that heated stones in the winter, turning the room into a sauna. In summer, the stained-glass and wood sliding doors opened to the stars outside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9437bc320827b04e34cf5d45992c13145198c6c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9437bc320827b04e34cf5d45992c13145198c6c1/0_16_725_435/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gungendo Flagship Store.

We\u2019d spent weeks eating fabulous food in Japan, but hers was the best. Though Tomi mostly cooked for people she knew well \u2013 her family, employees of the store \u2013 she also included guests she\u2019d never met, like us: friends of a friend of another friend. She relished introducing people to the Japan she loved, as it once was, as it still was in Omori.</p> <p>For the first time in more than a decade, I recently returned to Omori with Addie. I scheduled the trip so that Omori was the last stop \u2013 an antidote to days of <em>konbinis</em> (convenience stores), subways, temples, bullet trains, sprees at Uniqlo stores and carousel sushi restaurants. Now <a href=\"https://gungendo.com/\" title=\"\">Gungendo has a website</a> and the Matsubas have more than 28 shops within department stores and other commercial spaces throughout the country, as well as four freestanding stores. Of Gungendo\u2019s 180 employees, about 50 work in Omori, where Tomi and others design the fabrics and clothes and ship them to shops and customers throughout Japan. The Matsubas had also turned their home into <a href=\"https://www.oishisojapan.com/home/2017/9/30/takyo-abeke-japanese-guest-house\" title=\"\">Takyo Abeke</a> \u2013 an inn sleeping 12, which is often booked months in advance, as is a newer, second guest house called Katoke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f807358e8959064b31ab838bcf969823ffcf4c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f807358e8959064b31ab838bcf969823ffcf4c2a/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omori has an overtly traditional feel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Omori has an overtly traditional feel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Masao Ishihara/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other things have evolved over the past decade, too. Tomi no longer makes all the meals herself: her head chef, Takuro Onodera, cooks for guests, following a book of recipes created by Tomi and previous Abeke chefs. The meals are not designed to be fancy or gourmet, but simple, fresh and replicable. And though she and her husband now live down the street, Tomi joins her guests for almost every breakfast and dinner. </p> <p>On our first night, Onodera created about 15 dishes, served family-style at the kitchen\u2019s long communal table: peeled fresh tomatoes soaked in black vinegar and maple syrup, and blackthroat sea perch (<em>nodoguro</em>) caught in the nearby Sea of Japan and cooked with soy sauce and sweet sake. There were bowls of smoked edamame and sesame tofu, dishes of sesame snap peas and a homemade pizza with dried sardines, pickled vegetables and a local cheese.</p> <p>Many of the vegetables were locally grown. The fish was from a port just 20 minutes away. Even the sea salt came from a nearby salt farmer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f64bad001d72bfffabf9d6b8a48e84d14a1c288c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f64bad001d72bfffabf9d6b8a48e84d14a1c288c/0_0_3005_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 260-year-old farmhouse that the Matsubas bought at auction and moved, in pieces, to Omori.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"958\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 260-year-old farmhouse that the Matsubas bought at auction and moved, in pieces, to Omori.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maggie Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there were the rice balls, <em>onigiri</em> and <em>omusubi</em>. Perhaps it was the seasoning that made them so delicious. Or the fact that the rice was harvested from a nearby rice terrace. Or maybe it was because, while many Japanese make their rice in a steamer, at Takyo Abeke the rice \u2013 like most of the food \u2013 is cooked on the large woodburning stove that Tomi calls the heart of the home. </p> <p>After breakfast the next morning \u2013 broth with strips of hardened tofu and seaweed, pickled plums, rice porridge and a whole, though small, mackerel \u2013 I joined the morning tour Tomi offers her guests. The architectural scale of the town has remained virtually unchanged over the past 200 years and Tomi pointed out several of the 10 buildings she and her husband have renovated, all of which retain the Edo style. One of the most serene was the community centre, Mujaku-an, a simple, one-floor building without running water or electricity, where many of the ideas for Gungendo were sparked. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76453a63b438fcb52048dbbe4003895f627aaca3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76453a63b438fcb52048dbbe4003895f627aaca3/0_0_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omori.

      "bodyText": "One summer\u2019s day 14 years ago, my husband and I and our then two-year-old daughter, Addie, took a fast train, a slow train, a bus and a car to get from Kyoto to a 400-person village called Omori, near the Sea of Japan about 70 miles north of Hiroshima. In a narrow valley amid forested hills, Omori had one main street, few cars and even fewer shops. Most of the people seemed to be around 60 or older and lived in wooden houses, some originally owned by samurai, with tiled roofs and sliding wooden doors. Omori had once been famous for its nearby underground silver mine, Iwami Ginzan, which was open between 1526 and 1923 and a Unesco world heritage site since 2007. But by the time Tomi Matsuba and her husband, Daikichi, moved there in the early 1980s most of the homes sat empty. Daikichi\u2019s parents, who ran a kimono business there, encouraged Tomi and Daikichi to settle elsewhere. But the young couple had ideas about recapturing the beauty and pace of rural Japan by working with local artisans and farmers. When Tomi began to make clothes for her daughter, neighbours and friends asked her to do the same for them. Soon, Daikichi was selling the clothing at railway stations and department store events. Within a few years, the couple was turning down offers from big companies. Instead, they opened their own shop, which they called Gungendo, a word adapted from a Chinese proverb about people sharing their knowledge and opinions to work together. On my family\u2019s first trip to Omori, the shop had been open for several years and it was large and modern, with exposed wood and glass walls and a cafe that looked on to a garden. One room had shelves of handmade tea cups with ridges like sand, whimsical baby clothes and local jams and sauces. In another room hung women\u2019s cotton and linen skirts, shirts and pants, many of them designed by Tomi. And when we paid attention \u2013 and the Matsubas always encouraged people to slow down and pay attention \u2013 the shop offered little surprises everywhere. There was the tiny door to the garden only big enough for a child to fit through. In the bathroom, the stones gathered at the drain of the bathroom sink were so smooth I wanted to scoop them into my hands. And hidden among the garden\u2019s trees were two metal sculptures, made by a local artist known as Yoshida. Tall and round with amorphous faces and arms stretching toward the sky, they looked as if they might be friends with Totoro, from the popular animated tale. The most magical place, though, was the Matsubas\u2019 home, an Edo-period building that they had spent more than a decade restoring with materials from an old school and demolished houses, and even bits and pieces of wood they found on the street. A stone path, lined with a clan of Yoshida\u2019s sculptures, led to the entrance. Beyond the noren curtains, rooms flowed into other rooms, with shoji screen doors that opened on to porches and simple gardens. Along a pathway, woven wicker baskets hung from the walls. And in the gardens, stone sculptures peeked from the bushes. At night, Tomi invited us to take a bath in a handmade wooden tub that was so deep we could almost have swum. Next to it stood a stove that heated stones in the winter, turning the room into a sauna. In summer, the stained-glass and wood sliding doors opened to the stars outside. Tomi cooked dinners of sushi, tempura, pickled vegetables and soups, along with a traditional Japanese breakfast one morning and pancakes and fresh fruits the next. We\u2019d spent weeks eating fabulous food in Japan, but hers was the best. Though Tomi mostly cooked for people she knew well \u2013 her family, employees of the store \u2013 she also included guests she\u2019d never met, like us: friends of a friend of another friend. She relished introducing people to the Japan she loved, as it once was, as it still was in Omori. For the first time in more than a decade, I recently returned to Omori with Addie. I scheduled the trip so that Omori was the last stop \u2013 an antidote to days of konbinis (convenience stores), subways, temples, bullet trains, sprees at Uniqlo stores and carousel sushi restaurants. Now Gungendo has a website and the Matsubas have more than 28 shops within department stores and other commercial spaces throughout the country, as well as four freestanding stores. Of Gungendo\u2019s 180 employees, about 50 work in Omori, where Tomi and others design the fabrics and clothes and ship them to shops and customers throughout Japan. The Matsubas had also turned their home into Takyo Abeke \u2013 an inn sleeping 12, which is often booked months in advance, as is a newer, second guest house called Katoke. Other things have evolved over the past decade, too. Tomi no longer makes all the meals herself: her head chef, Takuro Onodera, cooks for guests, following a book of recipes created by Tomi and previous Abeke chefs. The meals are not designed to be fancy or gourmet, but simple, fresh and replicable. And though she and her husband now live down the street, Tomi joins her guests for almost every breakfast and dinner. On our first night, Onodera created about 15 dishes, served family-style at the kitchen\u2019s long communal table: peeled fresh tomatoes soaked in black vinegar and maple syrup, and blackthroat sea perch (nodoguro) caught in the nearby Sea of Japan and cooked with soy sauce and sweet sake. There were bowls of smoked edamame and sesame tofu, dishes of sesame snap peas and a homemade pizza with dried sardines, pickled vegetables and a local cheese. Many of the vegetables were locally grown. The fish was from a port just 20 minutes away. Even the sea salt came from a nearby salt farmer. Then there were the rice balls, onigiri and omusubi. Perhaps it was the seasoning that made them so delicious. Or the fact that the rice was harvested from a nearby rice terrace. Or maybe it was because, while many Japanese make their rice in a steamer, at Takyo Abeke the rice \u2013 like most of the food \u2013 is cooked on the large woodburning stove that Tomi calls the heart of the home. After breakfast the next morning \u2013 broth with strips of hardened tofu and seaweed, pickled plums, rice porridge and a whole, though small, mackerel \u2013 I joined the morning tour Tomi offers her guests. The architectural scale of the town has remained virtually unchanged over the past 200 years and Tomi pointed out several of the 10 buildings she and her husband have renovated, all of which retain the Edo style. One of the most serene was the community centre, Mujaku-an, a simple, one-floor building without running water or electricity, where many of the ideas for Gungendo were sparked. Further down the street, Tomi pointed out a bakery run by a Japanese-born, German-trained baker who settled in Omori not long ago with his family. Over the next couple of days, it would become our late-morning snack stop for brioches, warm pretzels, and raisin and olive breads. A few blocks away stood Tomi\u2019s business headquarters and next to it a majestic 260-year-old thatched farmhouse that the Matsubas bought at auction \u2013 using their profits, along with a crowdfunding campaign \u2013 in neighbouring Hiroshima Prefecture. They moved the entire thing, in pieces, to Omori and hired about a dozen workers to restore the thatched roof. The building is now the gathering spot for employee lunches, meetings and retreats. Outsiders have put down roots in town, including a violinist with the Orchestre National de France who lives in Omori when she isn\u2019t in France. Louie Miura, who jointly heads Gungendo\u2019s PR department, lives here too, having met Daikichi when he visited Miura\u2019s university to speak about Gungendo. Another employee, Mizu Ohkouchi, told me she visited Takyo Abeke several years ago for a one-night break. Tomi offered her a job on the spot after Ohkouchi told her she was unhappy in Tokyo. Children are also helping boost the population. About 20 babies have been born here in the past couple of years. On our first day, we met Tomi\u2019s daughter Yukiko out for a walk, one newborn twin in a carrier on her chest, the other sharing a buggy with her two-year-old sister, Haniwa. Yukiko remembered my daughter from years earlier and immediately put one of her babies in Addie\u2019s arms.

She spent the next day with Yukiko and her family, going on walks and shopping for groceries. Addie helped cook lunch and wash the kids\u2019 clothes, and she and Haniwa picked plums for pickling.

In the auditorium the audience was vocal in their reactions \u2013 laughing regularly and at one point breaking out into spontaneous applause mid-scene \u2013 and gave a standing ovation at the end. Outside the theatre, audience members said it would take time to process the experience. Sandra Hood, 62, a senior court clerk from New York, said she was attracted to the play by its provocative title and the reviews of its first run. \u201cIt sounded like something that would make me want to make my own opinion, because it sounded like there was quite a bit of polarity.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m digesting it \u2026 I\u2019m still sort of scratching my head about what point or points were intended, so it\u2019s going to be very individual, what you walk away with.\u201d Paris West, 29, a marketing associate from Westchester county, does not go to the theatre very often and when she does, she usually prefers musicals. She said: \u201cI\u2019m still processing it. There are a lot of themes. I sat with my mum so I\u2019m really interested in how she feels about it, but yeah, it was great \u2026 I haven\u2019t seen anything like it before, it\u2019s very provocative.\u201d Early viewers on Broadway have so far included the author Roxane Gay, who praised it on Twitter, saying it was \u201cincendiary and moving and hilarious and brilliant and uncomfortable and painful and true\u201d. Hamilton star and creator Lin-Manuel Miranda enthused: \u201cDear Jeremy, I can\u2019t be at opening but I\u2019m dying to see your play and I\u2019m so excited it\u2019s on Bway.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Co-op Energy describes itself as a \u201ccompany with a heart\u201d that makes a \u201creal difference in our communities\u201d. It has certainly made a difference to Clive Barber. He and his family are preparing to sell their house to pay a \u00a312,600 electricity bill that arrived out of the blue.</p> <p>It has also made a difference to Kel Harvey and his wife, who are being pursued by a debt collection agency for unexpected arrears totalling \u00a33,700. And to Thomas Wells, who has been paying \u00a3100 a month to clear a sudden debt of over \u00a32,000, despite switching to another supplier in 2016.</p> <p>All three appear to have fallen victim to Co-op\u2019s technical meltdown in 2015, when a new IT system played havoc with billing. Customers\u2019 direct debits were stopped, bills weren\u2019t sent and customers who tried to submit meter readings found themselves locked out of their online accounts. Co-op was ordered by regulator Ofgem to pay compensation totalling \u00a31.8m to 260,000 customers.</p> <p>However, it seems that some of its customers are now paying the price of the fiasco. Barber and Wells were among those whose direct debits were suddenly stopped when the new system was introduced. Harvey claims he asked in vain for a bill after switching to Co-op in 2016 and received a threat of disconnection before the first one arrived, demanding nearly \u00a33,000.</p> <p>Rules introduced by Ofgem last year forbid utilities companies from charging for more than 12 months of unbilled energy use before a correct bill has been issued. Those rules replaced a voluntary code to prevent companies who failed to bill their customers correctly from issuing shock demands for hefty arrears. However, in some cases Co-op appears to have ignored this in its efforts to claw in money it neglected to claim.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>We are currently making direct, manual payments of \u00a3200 a month, and yet they have seen fit to pass our \u2018debt\u2019 to a third party agent</p> <footer> <cite>Kel Harvey, Co-op Energy customer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Barber is being pursued by debt collectors for arrears going back to 2014 and has been forced to accept an expensive prepayment meter while he pays off the debt. He switched his supply to Co-op Energy in 2013 and set up a direct debit to pay for his consumption, which is high because his remote Cumbrian home has no gas supply. But his quarterly statements ceased in 2015, when he was notified that the company had installed a new billing system. </p> <p>He was assured his direct debits would continue as usual and his service would not be affected. Ten months later he received an email from Co-op Energy informing him that his account was \u00a34,191 in the red.</p> <p>\u201cOn several occasions I agreed to increase the direct debit and to pay off the three years\u2019 worth of arrears,\u201d he says. \u201cEach time, only a few payments were taken, then stopped.\u201d </p> <p>He says he has been receiving weekly calls from debt collectors appointed by Co-op and that the debt has spiralled to \u00a312,600 as he has struggled to keep pace with the repayments.</p> <p>\u201cEach time I explain the situation, and how we are now paying the debt off through a prepay meter at an agreed amount each week. I ask them to remove me from the call list, which they agree to do, but it simply does not work,\u201d he says. \u201cThe callers have no record of my history with Co-op Energy. As far as I am concerned this has amounted to harassment.\u201d</p> <p>Harvey opted to pay for his electricity quarterly after signing up to Co-op Energy in July 2016, but despite his requests he says no bill arrived and his smart meter, which should have relayed live readings, turned out to be dumb.</p> <p>\u201cWe are now in the position of being threatened for unbilled arrears dating back to 2016, despite numerous requests to sort out a proper, regular reading, billing and payment cycle,\u201d he says. \u201cEarlier this year we received the first two proper bills from them and we are currently making direct, manual payments of \u00a3200 a month, and yet they have seen fit to pass our \u2018debt\u2019 to a third party agent without notice to us.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>I assumed any arrears would need to be cleared before Co-op would allow a transfer but it let me go without issue</p> <footer> <cite>Thomas Wells, Co-op Energy customer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wells says Co-op Energy stopped collecting his direct debit payments in April 2015. He alerted the firm, but it did not fix the error for another five months. The problem resumed in April 2016 and Wells found himself unable to access his online account.</p> <p>In July that year he decided to change supplier to force the company to bill him. \u201cI assumed any arrears would need to be cleared before it would allow a transfer but it let me go without issue,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cNearly two years later, in March 2018, I was notified that I was \u00a34,352.47 in arrears for a period ending July 2016. A week later, I received another letter stating I was \u00a32,165.45 in arrears for the period ending 6 July 2016. A third letter, with the same date, told me I was \u00a32,307.90 in arrears, but for a period ending 27 July.</p> <p>\u201cEventually, I agreed that the arrears should be set at \u00a32,165.45 and am paying \u00a3200 a month on top of the dues to my current supplier.\u201d</p> <p>Co-op Energy only acknowledged that the back-billing rule should have been applied to Wells and Barber after pressure from the <em>Observer</em>. A week after we challenged it over Wells\u2019s predicament, it cancelled his debt, refunded the \u00a3800 he has so far repaid, and added \u00a3150 in goodwill. </p> <p>It has now reduced Barber\u2019s debt by \u00a33,079 to reflect the periods when his payments were stopped. It says: \u2018The service Mr Barber has received does not meet the high standards we set, and which our customers expect, and we have apologised to him for the experience he has had. Having reviewed his complaint, we agree that some of his outstanding balance is covered by the back-billing code and we have therefore discounted his account accordingly.\u201d </p> <p>However, the company, although acknowledging delays in resolving problems with Harvey\u2019s smart meter, insists he was billed on time and therefore does not qualify for backbilling. It says: \u201cWe take the back-billing principles seriously and have a number of processes in place to ensure we comply with them in all cases. Unfortunately, there have been a very small number of complaints where these processes weren\u2019t sufficient. We have looked at those complaints again and where the back-billing principles apply, we have reduced customer bills accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>Even with his debt reduced by the rule, Barber is struggling to repay the balance and says he is paying for Co-op\u2019s incompetence. \u201cThe debt is so bad we are decorating our home to sell, as we can no longer afford to stay here. I have been a tenant or a home owner for 35 years and never had a payment issue with any other utility supplier.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Co-op Energy describes itself as a \u201ccompany with a heart\u201d that makes a \u201creal difference in our communities\u201d. It has certainly made a difference to Clive Barber. He and his family are preparing to sell their house to pay a \u00a312,600 electricity bill that arrived out of the blue. It has also made a difference to Kel Harvey and his wife, who are being pursued by a debt collection agency for unexpected arrears totalling \u00a33,700. And to Thomas Wells, who has been paying \u00a3100 a month to clear a sudden debt of over \u00a32,000, despite switching to another supplier in 2016. All three appear to have fallen victim to Co-op\u2019s technical meltdown in 2015, when a new IT system played havoc with billing. Customers\u2019 direct debits were stopped, bills weren\u2019t sent and customers who tried to submit meter readings found themselves locked out of their online accounts. Co-op was ordered by regulator Ofgem to pay compensation totalling \u00a31.8m to 260,000 customers. However, it seems that some of its customers are now paying the price of the fiasco. Barber and Wells were among those whose direct debits were suddenly stopped when the new system was introduced. Harvey claims he asked in vain for a bill after switching to Co-op in 2016 and received a threat of disconnection before the first one arrived, demanding nearly \u00a33,000. Rules introduced by Ofgem last year forbid utilities companies from charging for more than 12 months of unbilled energy use before a correct bill has been issued. Those rules replaced a voluntary code to prevent companies who failed to bill their customers correctly from issuing shock demands for hefty arrears. However, in some cases Co-op appears to have ignored this in its efforts to claw in money it neglected to claim. Barber is being pursued by debt collectors for arrears going back to 2014 and has been forced to accept an expensive prepayment meter while he pays off the debt. He switched his supply to Co-op Energy in 2013 and set up a direct debit to pay for his consumption, which is high because his remote Cumbrian home has no gas supply. But his quarterly statements ceased in 2015, when he was notified that the company had installed a new billing system. He was assured his direct debits would continue as usual and his service would not be affected. Ten months later he received an email from Co-op Energy informing him that his account was \u00a34,191 in the red. \u201cOn several occasions I agreed to increase the direct debit and to pay off the three years\u2019 worth of arrears,\u201d he says. \u201cEach time, only a few payments were taken, then stopped.\u201d He says he has been receiving weekly calls from debt collectors appointed by Co-op and that the debt has spiralled to \u00a312,600 as he has struggled to keep pace with the repayments. \u201cEach time I explain the situation, and how we are now paying the debt off through a prepay meter at an agreed amount each week. I ask them to remove me from the call list, which they agree to do, but it simply does not work,\u201d he says. \u201cThe callers have no record of my history with Co-op Energy. As far as I am concerned this has amounted to harassment.\u201d Harvey opted to pay for his electricity quarterly after signing up to Co-op Energy in July 2016, but despite his requests he says no bill arrived and his smart meter, which should have relayed live readings, turned out to be dumb. \u201cWe are now in the position of being threatened for unbilled arrears dating back to 2016, despite numerous requests to sort out a proper, regular reading, billing and payment cycle,\u201d he says. \u201cEarlier this year we received the first two proper bills from them and we are currently making direct, manual payments of \u00a3200 a month, and yet they have seen fit to pass our \u2018debt\u2019 to a third party agent without notice to us.\u201d Wells says Co-op Energy stopped collecting his direct debit payments in April 2015. He alerted the firm, but it did not fix the error for another five months. The problem resumed in April 2016 and Wells found himself unable to access his online account. In July that year he decided to change supplier to force the company to bill him. \u201cI assumed any arrears would need to be cleared before it would allow a transfer but it let me go without issue,\u201d he says. \u201cNearly two years later, in March 2018, I was notified that I was \u00a34,352.47 in arrears for a period ending July 2016. A week later, I received another letter stating I was \u00a32,165.45 in arrears for the period ending 6 July 2016. A third letter, with the same date, told me I was \u00a32,307.90 in arrears, but for a period ending 27 July. \u201cEventually, I agreed that the arrears should be set at \u00a32,165.45 and am paying \u00a3200 a month on top of the dues to my current supplier.\u201d Co-op Energy only acknowledged that the back-billing rule should have been applied to Wells and Barber after pressure from the Observer. A week after we challenged it over Wells\u2019s predicament, it cancelled his debt, refunded the \u00a3800 he has so far repaid, and added \u00a3150 in goodwill. It has now reduced Barber\u2019s debt by \u00a33,079 to reflect the periods when his payments were stopped. It says: \u2018The service Mr Barber has received does not meet the high standards we set, and which our customers expect, and we have apologised to him for the experience he has had. Having reviewed his complaint, we agree that some of his outstanding balance is covered by the back-billing code and we have therefore discounted his account accordingly.\u201d However, the company, although acknowledging delays in resolving problems with Harvey\u2019s smart meter, insists he was billed on time and therefore does not qualify for backbilling. It says: \u201cWe take the back-billing principles seriously and have a number of processes in place to ensure we comply with them in all cases. Unfortunately, there have been a very small number of complaints where these processes weren\u2019t sufficient. We have looked at those complaints again and where the back-billing principles apply, we have reduced customer bills accordingly.\u201d Even with his debt reduced by the rule, Barber is struggling to repay the balance and says he is paying for Co-op\u2019s incompetence. \u201cThe debt is so bad we are decorating our home to sell, as we can no longer afford to stay here. I have been a tenant or a home owner for 35 years and never had a payment issue with any other utility supplier.\u201d",

The cut is bleeding badly again, streaming blood down the right side of his face. Fury is backing up, pawing at the wound. Wallin is letting his hands go. Another short hook by Wallin! He\u2019s timing Fury for another big left ... can he land it? And there\u2019s the final bell! What a fight!

Wallin tries to hold on but Fury leans down on him. Fury going for the knockout! Wallin looks like he\u2019s ready to go! His face is swollen and a trickle of blood is coming from his nose. Fury lands a punishing left to the liver with Wallin up against the ropes. Can Wallin make it out of the round? Wallin is trapped in the corner and is completely exhausted. Fury is teeing off. Wallin fighting back in spots but this is one-way traffic. </p> \n  <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 97-93 Wallin)</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T05:01:34.703Z\">at 6.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7dc4ca8f08f9df5bdd498f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T04:58:18.482Z\">5.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Round 9</strong></p> \n  <p>Wallin has all but abandoned the body attack that was working so well for him early on. Fury lands a big right, then backs Wallin up with a body shot. The cut over Fury\u2019s right eye has opened up and is gushing blood, but Wallin\u2019s punches have nothing on then. If feels like a race against time. Fury lands a hard uppercut in the center of the ring and backs his man up. Then Fury hurts Wallin badly with a left uppercut with seconds left in the round and the Swede seems to have been saved by the bell. </p> \n  <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 87-84 Wallin)</strong><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7dc41b8f08f9df5bdd498d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T04:54:57.266Z\">5.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Round 8</strong></p> \n  <p>Fury\u2019s pressure is changing the tenor of the proceedings. He lands two crunching shots to the body. A great uppercut by Fury. Now Fury continues to impose himself, leaning down on Wallin against the ropes. He\u2019s bleeding badly but he\u2019s landing more frequently and with the harder shots. This is another easy round for Fury, who is pouring on the punishment. CompuBox says Fury landed 23 of 63 shots, compared to nine of 28 for Wallin.</p> \n  <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 77-75 Wallin)</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T04:55:06.418Z\">at 5.55am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7dc3348f08f9df5bdd4989\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T04:51:23.416Z\">5.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Round 7</strong></p> \n  <p>Fury springs from the corner with half a jar of Vaseline on his right eye looking for a knockout early in the seventh. A renewed sense of urgency for the bigger man. He\u2019s throwing and landing more and physically imposing himself on his opponent. Wallin is taking Fury\u2019s best shots but it\u2019s midway through the round and he looks gassed. The Swede\u2019s eye is also beginning to swell. A big Fury round.</p> \n  <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 67-66 Wallin)</strong></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7dc22b8f08f30dc5bbb8f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T04:47:03.346Z\">5.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Round 6</strong></p> \n  <p>It\u2019s a good round for Wallin and Fury looks out of sorts. Referee Tony Weeks stops the action and asks the ringside physician to take a look at the cut. Oh boy. This could be it. Fury insists he can see and the fight will continue. Fury then springs off the ropes and unloads with a barrage of punches upstairs. Fury is now fighting with urgency but that cut is getting worse and worse. And right at the end of the round Wallin appeared to thumb at the cut when being separated off the break! Oh wow! He raked his glove across the gash. It\u2019s a deliberate foul and Fury looks both angry and surprised. That was filthy.</p> \n  <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 9-10 Wallin (Fury 57-57 Wallin)</strong><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7dc1398f08f9df5bdd4984\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T04:42:49.015Z\">5.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Round 5</strong></p> \n  <p>Looks like there\u2019s another cut on Fury\u2019s eye: one on the brow and another on the eyelid. Wallin is fearless and in pursuit of Fury, but Fury is doing just enough to win the exchanges. He lands a couple of good uppercuts and it\u2019s enough to take the round on my card. CompuBox says Wallin is connecting with an average of 10 punches per round, nearly double what Fury\u2019s last nine opponents managed to land.</p> \n  <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 48-47 Wallin)</strong></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7dc03a8f0834740f3bb6b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T04:39:02.312Z\">5.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Round 4</strong></p> \n  <p>Fury is bleeding badly. The blood is getting in his eye and he keeps wiping at it. Wallin is targeting the gash. Fury is upset, chirping at his opponent. Wallin showing no fear. High drama. Fury doesn\u2019t seem right and there could be a surprise in the offing. Fury has landed 39 of 160 punches so far, compared to 42 of 110 for Wallin. Fury\u2019s corner seem to think the cut was due to a clash of heads earlier in the rounds. Oh boy.</p> \n  <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 9-10 Wallin (Fury 38-38 Wallin)</strong></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7dbf708f08f30dc5bbb8ec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T04:35:03.033Z\">5.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Round 3</strong></p> \n  <p>Fury is using feints to try and set traps and create openings. He lands a hard right. Fury now landing a couple of hard shots upstairs. And Wallin lands a clean left hand on Fury\u2019s right eye that opens up a cut. And it\u2019s a bad one. After the round it\u2019s confirmed the Nevada state commission has seen it that way, too. That means if the fight is stopped due to the cut, Wallin will be declared the winner by TKO. High drama! </p> \n  <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 29-28 Wallin)</strong></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7dbe208f0834740f3bb6ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T04:29:42.184Z\">5.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Round 2</strong></p> \n  <p>A crisp combination of body shots by Wallin early in the second round. Fury answers with a right hand and switches to a southpaw stance like he\u2019s done in his recent fights. Wallin traps Wallin in a neutral corner and throws a bunch of shots to the body, some of which land cleanly. But Fury springs off the ropes and buzzes Wallin with a right hand. Another right hand to Wallin\u2019s temple at the end of the round. Fury is starting to find his range and tempo and he\u2019s getting the right hand going. </p> \n  <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 19-19 Wallin)</strong></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7dbce48f08f9df5bdd4978\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-15T04:24:10.110Z\">5.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Round 1</strong></p> \n  <p>Fury starts off boxing from the outside off the back foot as Wallin moves forward, trying to negotiate his way inside that rangy 85in jab.

The unheralded Wallin, who is unbeaten in 21 professional fights against mostly unknown opposition, isn\u2019t expected to put up much more in the way of resistance. But everyone\u2019s a dreamer after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/01/anthony-joshua-andy-ruiz-jr-boxing-heavyweight-title-fight\">Andy Ruiz Jr\u2019s shock upset of Anthony Joshua</a> earlier this year and the stout Swede would like nothing more than to stir up the echoes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhBny671ZwE\">Ingemar Johansson</a> and spoil Fury\u2019s plans of a rematch with Deontay Wilder that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/07/boxing-tyson-fury-says-deontay-wilder-rematch-agreed-february\">already been penciled in for early next year</a>.</p> \n  <p>Fury (28-0-1, 20 KOs) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/28/tyson-fury-shocks-wladimir-klitschko-world-heavyweight-title-champion\">ended Wladimir Klitschko\u2019s decade-long title reign</a> with a dull but effective display in Germany four years ago, only to surrender all the belts during a 31-month layoff where he underwent a public bout with mental illness and ballooned from 260lbs to nearly 400lbs. These days the official titles at heavyweight belong to Wilder, who\u2019s owned the WBC\u2019s version of the championship since 2015, and Ruiz Jr, who captured the WBA, WBO and IBF straps from Joshua. Yet one could argue Fury\u2019s claim to the mantle of world\u2019s best heavyweight is purest as the lineal champion: the so-called man who beat the man who beat the man. </p> \n  <p>Tonight marks Fury\u2019s fifth \u201cdefense\u201d of that nominal title he won from Klitschko and he\u2019s down to his lightest weight since that night in D\u00fcsseldorf, coming in at 254.4lbs at yesterday\u2019s weigh-in. That\u2019s down from 263.5lbs against Schwarz in June, 256.5lbs against Wilder in December, 258lbs against Francisco Pianeta last August and 276lbs against Sefer Seferi in June 2018 in his comeback fight.</p> \n  <p>Wallin (20-0 with 1 NC, 13 KOs) has had a quite an up-and-down time of it during his brief time in America. Showtime was trying to build him up earlier in the year as a potential opponent for Wilder, slating him in the co-feature of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/apr/13/claressa-shields-v-christina-hammer-undisputed-middleweight-championship-live\">Claressa Shields-Christina Hammer card in Atlantic City</a>, but he was forced to settle for a no-contest in his US debut after opponent Nick Kisner suffered a cut from an accidental clash of heads in the first round of their scheduled 10-rounder. Then a July date with gatekeeper BJ Flores was scuttled on the day of the fight when it was revealed Flores was denied a license after medical tests. But what appeared to be a hard-luck year for Wallin turned around in a hurry when he was given a shot at Fury. Whether the opportunity has come too soon for the Swedish prospect, who\u2019s never been in with an opponent of Fury\u2019s class, remains to be seen.</p> \n  <p>The fighters should make their ringwalks about an hour from now. Plenty more to come between now and then.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7d6aa58f08f30dc5bbb7ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-14T22:33:48.847Z\">11.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Bryan will be here shortly.</strong> In the meantime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2019/sep/13/tyson-fury-wilder-rematch-talk-can-wait-until-ive-finished-partying-in-vegas-video\">let\u2019s check in with Tyson Fury</a> ahead of tonight\u2019s heavyweight scrap.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"541397ad-8ce3-4ae6-aa79-07fe3587bb21\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q_cHfKOHqUI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "What a night. What a fight. You can read a full report here. Fury wins a unanimous decision by scores of 116-112, 117-111 and 118-110. High drama on a wild night in Las Vegas but the outcome everyone expected in the end. Round 12 Wallin lands a big left hand early in the round. And he\u2019s hurt Fury! Fury is hurt against the run of play and he\u2019s holding on! Wallin landing punches and taking his shot. The cut is bleeding badly again, streaming blood down the right side of his face. Fury is backing up, pawing at the wound. Wallin is letting his hands go. Another short hook by Wallin! He\u2019s timing Fury for another big left ... can he land it? And there\u2019s the final bell! What a fight! It should be a clear decision for Fury, but let\u2019s hang around for the official scores just in case. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 9-10 Wallin (Fury 116-112 Wallin) Round 11 Fury is picking away at his opponent from bell to bell in total command of the action. Then at the end of the round Fury lands a massive left hand to the body that badly hurts Wallin. He\u2019s saved by the bell. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 107-102 Wallin) Round 10 Fury races from the corner and opens up with a furious combination of a dozen punches upstairs. Wallin tries to hold on but Fury leans down on him. Fury going for the knockout! Wallin looks like he\u2019s ready to go! His face is swollen and a trickle of blood is coming from his nose. Fury lands a punishing left to the liver with Wallin up against the ropes. Can Wallin make it out of the round? Wallin is trapped in the corner and is completely exhausted. Fury is teeing off. Wallin fighting back in spots but this is one-way traffic. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 97-93 Wallin) Round 9 Wallin has all but abandoned the body attack that was working so well for him early on. Fury lands a big right, then backs Wallin up with a body shot. The cut over Fury\u2019s right eye has opened up and is gushing blood, but Wallin\u2019s punches have nothing on then. If feels like a race against time. Fury lands a hard uppercut in the center of the ring and backs his man up. Then Fury hurts Wallin badly with a left uppercut with seconds left in the round and the Swede seems to have been saved by the bell. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 87-84 Wallin) Round 8 Fury\u2019s pressure is changing the tenor of the proceedings. He lands two crunching shots to the body. A great uppercut by Fury. Now Fury continues to impose himself, leaning down on Wallin against the ropes. He\u2019s bleeding badly but he\u2019s landing more frequently and with the harder shots. This is another easy round for Fury, who is pouring on the punishment. CompuBox says Fury landed 23 of 63 shots, compared to nine of 28 for Wallin. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 77-75 Wallin) Round 7 Fury springs from the corner with half a jar of Vaseline on his right eye looking for a knockout early in the seventh. A renewed sense of urgency for the bigger man. He\u2019s throwing and landing more and physically imposing himself on his opponent. Wallin is taking Fury\u2019s best shots but it\u2019s midway through the round and he looks gassed. The Swede\u2019s eye is also beginning to swell. A big Fury round. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 67-66 Wallin) Round 6 It\u2019s a good round for Wallin and Fury looks out of sorts. Referee Tony Weeks stops the action and asks the ringside physician to take a look at the cut. Oh boy. This could be it. Fury insists he can see and the fight will continue. Fury then springs off the ropes and unloads with a barrage of punches upstairs. Fury is now fighting with urgency but that cut is getting worse and worse. And right at the end of the round Wallin appeared to thumb at the cut when being separated off the break! Oh wow! He raked his glove across the gash. It\u2019s a deliberate foul and Fury looks both angry and surprised. That was filthy. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 9-10 Wallin (Fury 57-57 Wallin) Round 5 Looks like there\u2019s another cut on Fury\u2019s eye: one on the brow and another on the eyelid. Wallin is fearless and in pursuit of Fury, but Fury is doing just enough to win the exchanges. He lands a couple of good uppercuts and it\u2019s enough to take the round on my card. CompuBox says Wallin is connecting with an average of 10 punches per round, nearly double what Fury\u2019s last nine opponents managed to land. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 48-47 Wallin) Round 4 Fury is bleeding badly. The blood is getting in his eye and he keeps wiping at it. Wallin is targeting the gash. Fury is upset, chirping at his opponent. Wallin showing no fear. High drama. Fury doesn\u2019t seem right and there could be a surprise in the offing. Fury has landed 39 of 160 punches so far, compared to 42 of 110 for Wallin. Fury\u2019s corner seem to think the cut was due to a clash of heads earlier in the rounds. Oh boy. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 9-10 Wallin (Fury 38-38 Wallin) Round 3 Fury is using feints to try and set traps and create openings. He lands a hard right. Fury now landing a couple of hard shots upstairs. And Wallin lands a clean left hand on Fury\u2019s right eye that opens up a cut. And it\u2019s a bad one. After the round it\u2019s confirmed the Nevada state commission has seen it that way, too. That means if the fight is stopped due to the cut, Wallin will be declared the winner by TKO. High drama! Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 29-28 Wallin) Round 2 A crisp combination of body shots by Wallin early in the second round. Fury answers with a right hand and switches to a southpaw stance like he\u2019s done in his recent fights. Wallin traps Wallin in a neutral corner and throws a bunch of shots to the body, some of which land cleanly. But Fury springs off the ropes and buzzes Wallin with a right hand. Another right hand to Wallin\u2019s temple at the end of the round. Fury is starting to find his range and tempo and he\u2019s getting the right hand going. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 10-9 Wallin (Fury 19-19 Wallin) Round 1 Fury starts off boxing from the outside off the back foot as Wallin moves forward, trying to negotiate his way inside that rangy 85in jab. Fury is working the jab to the head and body. Wallin burrows inside and connect with a left hand to the body that draws a reaction from the crowd. Wallin is stuggling to get inside but he\u2019s cutting distance and getting the bigger man to the ropes. Quite an uneventful opening round but Wallin takes it. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Fury 9-10 Wallin (Fury 9-10 Wallin) Here we go. After performances of the national anthems of Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States, it\u2019s time for the fighter entrances. First comes Otto Wallin, who jogs to the ring in a sleeveless black robe with gold and blue trim. Now it\u2019s Tyson Fury, wearing a poncho-style robe designed like the flag of Mexico and a large sombrero in keeping with his week-long celebration of Mexican Independence Day. Gala\u2019s Freed from Desire is playing throughout the T-Mobile Arena as Fury makes his way toward the arena floor, emerging from the tunnel onto a red, white and green chariot of sorts as a mariachi band plays alongside dancers and a singer belting out El Rey by Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez. Oh boy. Jimmy Lennon Jr is going through the fighter introductions and we should be under way any minute now. We\u2019ll pick it up with round-by-round commentary from here. Emanuel Navarrete has just defended his WBO junior featherweight title with a fourth-round TKO of Juan Miguel Elorde in the final preliminary bout. The Mexico City fighter, making his second title defense in four weeks and third since May, dropped the grandson of Filipino legend Flash Elorde with one second left in the third before referee Russell Mora correctly intervened at the 0:26 mark of the fourth. That means Fury and Wallin should be making their ringwalks imminently. Here\u2019s a look at how Fury and Wallin match up ahead of tonight\u2019s main event. The Swede is roughly a 10-1 underdog in the contest, a nod to Fury\u2019s superior class of competition as much as his reach and height advantages. Jose Zepeda has just won a unanimous decision over former two-division champion Jose Pedraza to spoil Pedraza\u2019s junior welterweight debut. All three judges scored it 97-93 for the California southpaw, as did the Guardian. The final undercard fight of the evening is next as WBO junior featherweight world champion Emanuel Navarrete defends his title against Juan Miguel Elorde. After that, Fury and Wallin will make their entrances. Good evening and welcome to tonight\u2019s heavyweight showdown between Tyson Fury and Otto Wallin at T-Mobile Arena. The Gypsy King is back in action on the Las Vegas strip for the second time in four months following a June blowout of no-hoper Tom Schwarz at the MGM Grand in the first fight of his newly signed co-promotional deal with Top Rank. The unheralded Wallin, who is unbeaten in 21 professional fights against mostly unknown opposition, isn\u2019t expected to put up much more in the way of resistance. But everyone\u2019s a dreamer after Andy Ruiz Jr\u2019s shock upset of Anthony Joshua earlier this year and the stout Swede would like nothing more than to stir up the echoes of Ingemar Johansson and spoil Fury\u2019s plans of a rematch with Deontay Wilder that\u2019s already been penciled in for early next year. Fury (28-0-1, 20 KOs) ended Wladimir Klitschko\u2019s decade-long title reign with a dull but effective display in Germany four years ago, only to surrender all the belts during a 31-month layoff where he underwent a public bout with mental illness and ballooned from 260lbs to nearly 400lbs. These days the official titles at heavyweight belong to Wilder, who\u2019s owned the WBC\u2019s version of the championship since 2015, and Ruiz Jr, who captured the WBA, WBO and IBF straps from Joshua. Yet one could argue Fury\u2019s claim to the mantle of world\u2019s best heavyweight is purest as the lineal champion: the so-called man who beat the man who beat the man. Tonight marks Fury\u2019s fifth \u201cdefense\u201d of that nominal title he won from Klitschko and he\u2019s down to his lightest weight since that night in D\u00fcsseldorf, coming in at 254.4lbs at yesterday\u2019s weigh-in. That\u2019s down from 263.5lbs against Schwarz in June, 256.5lbs against Wilder in December, 258lbs against Francisco Pianeta last August and 276lbs against Sefer Seferi in June 2018 in his comeback fight. Wallin (20-0 with 1 NC, 13 KOs) has had a quite an up-and-down time of it during his brief time in America. Showtime was trying to build him up earlier in the year as a potential opponent for Wilder, slating him in the co-feature of the Claressa Shields-Christina Hammer card in Atlantic City, but he was forced to settle for a no-contest in his US debut after opponent Nick Kisner suffered a cut from an accidental clash of heads in the first round of their scheduled 10-rounder. Then a July date with gatekeeper BJ Flores was scuttled on the day of the fight when it was revealed Flores was denied a license after medical tests. But what appeared to be a hard-luck year for Wallin turned around in a hurry when he was given a shot at Fury. Whether the opportunity has come too soon for the Swedish prospect, who\u2019s never been in with an opponent of Fury\u2019s class, remains to be seen. The fighters should make their ringwalks about an hour from now. Plenty more to come between now and then. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime let\u2019s check in with Tyson Fury ahead of tonight\u2019s heavyweight scrap.",

      "bodyText": "Nearly 35 years ago, the pollster Stanley Greenberg took a hard look at Macomb county, Michigan, wanting to better understand the political DNA of \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d. He concluded: \u201cThese white Democratic defectors express a profound distaste for blacks, a sentiment that pervades almost everything they think about government and politics.\u201d A supporter of Robert Kennedy in 1968, Greenberg saw class, not race, as the lever of choice in wooing Democratic voters. A quarter-century later, he was Bill Clinton\u2019s pollster in his victorious 1992 presidential bid. Now Greenberg delivers RIP GOP, in which he predicts that the rage engendered by Donald Trump will lead to his defeat in 2020, Democratic control of the Senate and the collapse of the current Republican party. Imagine the past midterms on steroids. An illustration of a dead elephant lying on a mound of dirt, all four legs skyward, graces Greenberg\u2019s cover. Apparently, the author is less interested in unifying the US than in forging durable coalitions. Think math, not therapy. It\u2019s about 50% +1. The book is methodically and meticulously researched.

      "body": "<p>She was in the early stages of a relationship with a man who pretended to be a police officer. He was gradually more controlling and, at one point, he became jealous of photos on her phone. \u201cHe punched me in the back of the head, then he raped me\u2026 The second time he attacked me he had a huge kitchen knife.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca \u2013 not her real name \u2013 eventually reported her attacker to the police. It turned out that he was a prisoner released on licence, with a history of violence against women. He was initially charged with three counts of rape, as well as assault by beating and false imprisonment. But Rebecca was later informed that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/10/cps-faces-challenge-over-covert-policy-change-on-cases\" title=\"\">Crown Prosecution Service</a> was dropping charges, because if a jury saw the amicable WhatsApp messages between Rebecca and her attacker \u2013 the messages Rebecca says she sent to her abuser to placate him in order to try to stay alive \u2013 they would not convict.</p> <p>Rebecca is not the only rape survivor to have been denied the chance of justice in recent years. Annie Tisshaw says she was raped in her flat by a man she had been on a few dates with. She reported it to the police and was told it was a \u201cpositive\u201d case by the CPS, but a year later was informed it was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49669760\" title=\"\">dropping the case</a> due to \u201cinconsistencies\u201d that included text messages she sent before the rape and the fact she did not look \u201cparticularly scared or nervous\u201d in CCTV images from earlier that night.</p> <p>Figures out last week suggest that there will be many other women with stories like Rebecca\u2019s and Annie\u2019s. Despite a 9% increase in the number of rapes reported to the police in the last year, there has been a significant fall in the number of cases being taken to trial by the CPS.

He was gradually more controlling and, at one point, he became jealous of photos on her phone. \u201cHe punched me in the back of the head, then he raped me\u2026 The second time he attacked me he had a huge kitchen knife.\u201d Rebecca \u2013 not her real name \u2013 eventually reported her attacker to the police. It turned out that he was a prisoner released on licence, with a history of violence against women. He was initially charged with three counts of rape, as well as assault by beating and false imprisonment. But Rebecca was later informed that the Crown Prosecution Service was dropping charges, because if a jury saw the amicable WhatsApp messages between Rebecca and her attacker \u2013 the messages Rebecca says she sent to her abuser to placate him in order to try to stay alive \u2013 they would not convict. Rebecca is not the only rape survivor to have been denied the chance of justice in recent years. Annie Tisshaw says she was raped in her flat by a man she had been on a few dates with. She reported it to the police and was told it was a \u201cpositive\u201d case by the CPS, but a year later was informed it was dropping the case due to \u201cinconsistencies\u201d that included text messages she sent before the rape and the fact she did not look \u201cparticularly scared or nervous\u201d in CCTV images from earlier that night. Figures out last week suggest that there will be many other women with stories like Rebecca\u2019s and Annie\u2019s. Despite a 9% increase in the number of rapes reported to the police in the last year, there has been a significant fall in the number of cases being taken to trial by the CPS. The number of rape charges fell by 38% in a year, the number of rape prosecutions by 33%, and the number of convictions by 27%. It is the second year running that the number of rape charges has fallen dramatically.

Texas is an obsession. Above all, Texas is a nation in every sense of the word.\u201d More recently, Nthe ew Yorker writer and Austin resident Lawrence Wright, author of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/books/review-god-save-texas-lawrence-wright.html\">God Save Texas: A Journey into the Soul of the Lone Star State</a>, wrote: \u201cTexans see themselves as a distillation of the best qualities of America: friendly, confident, hardworking, patriotic, neurosis-free.\u201d</p> <p>Though Texas as a Republican stronghold is fixed in the popular imagination, significant demographic and cultural shifts \u2013 a growing Hispanic population and an influx of newcomers to the cities \u2013 are loosening the GOP\u2019s grip. Given the importance of the state in the election of president, accounting for 38 electoral votes and 7% of the electoral college in 2016, this has huge national significance.</p> <p>Suddenly, everyone from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamPelosi/status/1102977719854395392?mod=article_inline\">House </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamPelosi/status/1102977719854395392?mod=article_inline\">speaker, Nancy Pelosi</a>, to Republican senator <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xbku_ohiys\">Ted </a>Cruz believes Texas is up for grabs. It was O\u2019Rourke\u2019s spirited Senate run last year, against Cruz, that led many here to believe that the political sands may be shifting.</p> <p>\u201cTexas is going to be hotly contested in 2020,\u201d Cruz <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xbku_ohiys\">said</a> at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast last week. He was confident that Trump would win, but said the result \u201cwill be closer than last time\u201d.</p> <p>Tom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chair, said his organization chose Houston for the third debate because the state is \u201cin play up and down the ballot\u201d. He said there are millions of Latinos eligible to vote in Texas but who sat out in 2018 and could make a difference in 2020.</p> <p>\u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke lost by 200,000 votes,\u201d he said at a \u201cCafecito con Politics\u201d event in Houston on Friday. \u201cThere were 3.5 million voters last year \u2013 Latinos \u2013 who did not vote and could have voted.\u201d</p> <p>Texas has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1976. Donald Trump continued the streak in 2016, but by a far slimmer margin than past nominees.</p> <p>Democrats believe Trump\u2019s unpopularity with suburban women and Hispanic voters could accelerate the political upheaval.</p> <h2>\u20181,000 new Texans a day\u2019</h2> <p>Texas is often portrayed in popular culture as emblematic of the frontier spirit, populated by God-fearing, gun-loving, rock-ribbed conservatives. The reality is more nuanced.</p> <p>As Wright pointed out, \u201cTexans are hardly monolithic. The state is as politically divided as the rest of the nation. One can drive across it and be in two different states at the same time: FM Texas and AM Texas. FM Texas is the silky voice of city dwellers, the kingdom of National Public Radio. It is progressive, reasonable, secular \u2013 almost like California. AM Texas speaks to the suburbs and the rural areas: Trumpland.\u201d</p> <p>Since 2010, <a href=\"https://demographics.texas.gov/Data/Decennial/2020/\">3.5 million new residents </a>have moved to the state. Jobs and affordable housing continue to lure young, college-educated workers to Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, said Lila Valencia, a senior demographer at the Texas Demographic Center.</p> <p>These newcomers, many of them diverse and liberal, are reshaping the political landscape in once-reliably conservative suburban districts. In recent weeks, five Texas Republicans have announced their retirement from Congress, including three who won in 2018 by less than 5%.</p> <p>Among them is Will Hurd, the only black Republican in the House, who beat Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones by less than 1% in 2018. Ortiz Jones is running again. If she wins, and barring any incumbent losses, the entire 2,000-mile US-Mexico border will be represented by Democrats.</p> <p>After flipping two districts in 2018, Democrats are targeting half a dozen Republican seats in 2020. For their part, Republicans will aim to win back both seats next year. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have magic in the air right now, so much excitement from all communities but especially the Latino community</p> <footer> <cite>Lina Hidalgo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have magic in the air right now, so much excitement from all communities but especially the Latino community,\u201d Lina Hidalgo, a 28-year-old Colombian immigrant who beat an incumbent Republican for judge in Harris county, said at an event in Houston. </p> <p>During a later panel, Latina \u200borganizers and activists \u200bwarned that politicians \u200bcannot sweep into their communities, \u201csay a few words in Spanish\u201d and expect their vote. The outreach must be sincere - and nuanced. As several speakers stressed, the Hispanic electorate in Texas is not a monolith and immigration is not their only priority.</p> <p>\u201cEvery cycle \u200b[pundits] will start to say \u2018Latinos are not going to turn out,\u2019\u201d said Michelle Tremillo, the executive director of the Texas Organizing Project. \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating because we know that\u200b if they have a reason to turn out, they will turn out.\u201d</p> <p>Yet demographic changes\u200b \u200b\u2013 or anger at Trump \u2013 will not transform Texas politics, said Monica Gomez, the political director of Annie\u2019s List, a progressive group dedicated to electing Democratic women in Texas. She said Democrats must invest heavily in voter registration and mobilization efforts to turn out these new, eligible voters.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to turn out more Texans than ever in 2020,\u201d she said. \u201cWe gain 1,000 new Texans a day. By 2022 there will be more people who are Hispanic than white in the state, so we are really seeing trends that are younger and more diverse.\u201d</p> <p>Despite growing political clout in Texas and around the country, many Hispanic voters say Trump\u2019s nativist, anti-immigrant rhetoric makes them feel unsafe.</p> <p>In August, a mass shooting in El Paso left 22 people, many of them Latino, dead. The deadliest direct attack on Latinos in modern US history, it forced a conversation on immigration, guns and white nationalism. </p> <p>In a Univision Poll <a href=\"https://www.univision.com/local/austin-kakw/univision-news/politics/univision-news-poll-democrats-surge-in-texas-no-longer-a-safe-state-for-trump-in-2020\">released</a> last week, 71% of Texas Latinos said they believed the gunman was a \u201cracist who was influenced by anti-immigrant and anti-Mexican statements made by President Trump\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018Keep Texas red\u2019</h2> <p>Ahead of the debate, the Texas Democratic party launched an <a href=\"https://www.texasdemocrats.org/blog/texas-democrats-path-to-victory/\">initiative</a> to register 2.6 million new voters, with an emphasis on Hispanics and people under 35. In contrast, Republicans increasingly rely on white, rural voters. The state GOP has duly launched its own effort to \u201ckeep Texas red\u201d.</p> <p>In Houston on Thursday, a plane flew above the debate venue trailing a banner that read: \u201cSocialism will kill Houston\u2019s economy! Vote Trump 2020!\u201d</p> <p>Amid all the Democratic optimism, some observers say it should be remembered that it has been 25 years since Texas last elected a Democrat to statewide office. And though the state\u2019s electoral votes are a tempting prize, some warn that chasing them will be a waste of time. The party, such critics believe, should focus on winning back traditionally Democratic states in the rust belt, such as Wisconsin and Michigan.</p> <p>In the state itself, Democrats believe the party should absolutely mess with Texas.</p> <p>\u201cRepublicans in Texas want us to believe that there was some kind of \u2018Beto miracle\u2019 in 2018, that it was a one-time thing and that Democrats are never going to get that close again,\u201d said Tara Pohlmeyer of the liberal advocacy group Progress Texas.</p> <p>\u201cBut from everything we\u2019re seeing on the ground it\u2019s clear his campaign was not an outlier. It was just the beginning.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2019 to clarify that the shooting in El Paso was the deadliest direct attack on Latinos in modern US history.</p>",

Above all, Texas is a nation in every sense of the word.\u201d More recently, Nthe ew Yorker writer and Austin resident Lawrence Wright, author of God Save Texas: A Journey into the Soul of the Lone Star State, wrote: \u201cTexans see themselves as a distillation of the best qualities of America: friendly, confident, hardworking, patriotic, neurosis-free.\u201d Though Texas as a Republican stronghold is fixed in the popular imagination, significant demographic and cultural shifts \u2013 a growing Hispanic population and an influx of newcomers to the cities \u2013 are loosening the GOP\u2019s grip. Given the importance of the state in the election of president, accounting for 38 electoral votes and 7% of the electoral college in 2016, this has huge national significance. Suddenly, everyone from the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Republican senator Ted Cruz believes Texas is up for grabs. It was O\u2019Rourke\u2019s spirited Senate run last year, against Cruz, that led many here to believe that the political sands may be shifting. \u201cTexas is going to be hotly contested in 2020,\u201d Cruz said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast last week. He was confident that Trump would win, but said the result \u201cwill be closer than last time\u201d. Tom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chair, said his organization chose Houston for the third debate because the state is \u201cin play up and down the ballot\u201d. He said there are millions of Latinos eligible to vote in Texas but who sat out in 2018 and could make a difference in 2020. \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke lost by 200,000 votes,\u201d he said at a \u201cCafecito con Politics\u201d event in Houston on Friday. \u201cThere were 3.5 million voters last year \u2013 Latinos \u2013 who did not vote and could have voted.\u201d Texas has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1976. Donald Trump continued the streak in 2016, but by a far slimmer margin than past nominees. Democrats believe Trump\u2019s unpopularity with suburban women and Hispanic voters could accelerate the political upheaval. \u20181,000 new Texans a day\u2019 Texas is often portrayed in popular culture as emblematic of the frontier spirit, populated by God-fearing, gun-loving, rock-ribbed conservatives. The reality is more nuanced. As Wright pointed out, \u201cTexans are hardly monolithic. The state is as politically divided as the rest of the nation. One can drive across it and be in two different states at the same time: FM Texas and AM Texas. FM Texas is the silky voice of city dwellers, the kingdom of National Public Radio. It is progressive, reasonable, secular \u2013 almost like California. AM Texas speaks to the suburbs and the rural areas: Trumpland.\u201d Since 2010, 3.5 million new residents have moved to the state. Jobs and affordable housing continue to lure young, college-educated workers to Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, said Lila Valencia, a senior demographer at the Texas Demographic Center. These newcomers, many of them diverse and liberal, are reshaping the political landscape in once-reliably conservative suburban districts. In recent weeks, five Texas Republicans have announced their retirement from Congress, including three who won in 2018 by less than 5%. Among them is Will Hurd, the only black Republican in the House, who beat Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones by less than 1% in 2018. Ortiz Jones is running again. If she wins, and barring any incumbent losses, the entire 2,000-mile US-Mexico border will be represented by Democrats. After flipping two districts in 2018, Democrats are targeting half a dozen Republican seats in 2020. For their part, Republicans will aim to win back both seats next year. \u201cWe have magic in the air right now, so much excitement from all communities but especially the Latino community,\u201d Lina Hidalgo, a 28-year-old Colombian immigrant who beat an incumbent Republican for judge in Harris county, said at an event in Houston. During a later panel, Latina organizers and activists warned that politicians cannot sweep into their communities, \u201csay a few words in Spanish\u201d and expect their vote. The outreach must be sincere - and nuanced. As several speakers stressed, the Hispanic electorate in Texas is not a monolith and immigration is not their only priority. \u201cEvery cycle [pundits] will start to say \u2018Latinos are not going to turn out,\u2019\u201d said Michelle Tremillo, the executive director of the Texas Organizing Project. \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating because we know that if they have a reason to turn out, they will turn out.\u201d Yet demographic changes \u2013 or anger at Trump \u2013 will not transform Texas politics, said Monica Gomez, the political director of Annie\u2019s List, a progressive group dedicated to electing Democratic women in Texas. She said Democrats must invest heavily in voter registration and mobilization efforts to turn out these new, eligible voters. \u201cWe\u2019re going to turn out more Texans than ever in 2020,\u201d she said. \u201cWe gain 1,000 new Texans a day. By 2022 there will be more people who are Hispanic than white in the state, so we are really seeing trends that are younger and more diverse.\u201d Despite growing political clout in Texas and around the country, many Hispanic voters say Trump\u2019s nativist, anti-immigrant rhetoric makes them feel unsafe. In August, a mass shooting in El Paso left 22 people, many of them Latino, dead. The deadliest direct attack on Latinos in modern US history, it forced a conversation on immigration, guns and white nationalism. In a Univision Poll released last week, 71% of Texas Latinos said they believed the gunman was a \u201cracist who was influenced by anti-immigrant and anti-Mexican statements made by President Trump\u201d. \u2018Keep Texas red\u2019 Ahead of the debate, the Texas Democratic party launched an initiative to register 2.6 million new voters, with an emphasis on Hispanics and people under 35. In contrast, Republicans increasingly rely on white, rural voters. The state GOP has duly launched its own effort to \u201ckeep Texas red\u201d. In Houston on Thursday, a plane flew above the debate venue trailing a banner that read: \u201cSocialism will kill Houston\u2019s economy! Vote Trump 2020!\u201d Amid all the Democratic optimism, some observers say it should be remembered that it has been 25 years since Texas last elected a Democrat to statewide office. And though the state\u2019s electoral votes are a tempting prize, some warn that chasing them will be a waste of time. The party, such critics believe, should focus on winning back traditionally Democratic states in the rust belt, such as Wisconsin and Michigan. In the state itself, Democrats believe the party should absolutely mess with Texas. \u201cRepublicans in Texas want us to believe that there was some kind of \u2018Beto miracle\u2019 in 2018, that it was a one-time thing and that Democrats are never going to get that close again,\u201d said Tara Pohlmeyer of the liberal advocacy group Progress Texas. \u201cBut from everything we\u2019re seeing on the ground it\u2019s clear his campaign was not an outlier. It was just the beginning.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2019 to clarify that the shooting in El Paso was the deadliest direct attack on Latinos in modern US history.",

But that\u2019s exactly what Canyon has done with its latest ride. The online brand behind some of the sleekest, fleetest bikes on the market (it was the ride of choice for the <a href=\"https://movistarteam.com/en/about-us\" title=\"\">Movistar</a> team at this year\u2019s Tour de France) has added a powerful engine to its bestselling Roadlite hybrid and renamed it the <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/e-bikes/e-fitness-bikes/roadlite-on/\" title=\"\">Roadlite:ON</a>. Electric assistance comes from a smart Fazua Evation drive system, the battery is neatly concealed in the frame\u2019s downtube and the zippy motor is hidden in the bottom bracket. The battery is very easy to remove so, in theory, you can ride the ebike without any power assistance if you want to. But why would do that? It would be like buying Magimix then chopping your veg by hand, with a blunt knife.</p> <p>Before serious riders choke on their energy bars, consider this: the lazy ebiker purring passed you could actually be taking <em>more</em> exercise than you. A recent study published in <em><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259019821930017X\" title=\"\">Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives</a></em> followed 10,000 adults in seven European countries. Researchers determined their average energy expenditure on different forms of transportation, including electric bicycles, pedal bicycles, walking, running, etc. And guess what? Ebikers edged out pedal bikers in terms of total exercise taken \u2013 thanks mostly to the overall greater distances covered on their commute. They also found ebikers tended to be older, with an average age of 48 compared to 41 for standard cyclists, and on the whole were people who were \u201ctraditionally less physically active\u201d.</p> <p>So this new motorised Canyon could be just the bike for them \u2013 and you. The frame is aluminium with carbon forks. It weighs in at 15.5kg. The gearing is a 1x Shimano mountain bike drivetrain (this means it only has one chainring at the front, rather than two, which makes it less prone to niggles and snags). It has neat internal cabling and disc brakes. It is a bike designed to make riding simple and maintenance easy. In keeping with this low-hassle approach, Canyon has gone for flat handlebars rather than the curved bars you usually get on road bikes. There\u2019s a lot of snobbery attached to flat bars. They mark you out as \u201cnon-serious\u201d. That\u2019s ridiculous as they are so much easier to use. The more upright seating position also improves comfort and visibility. If you don\u2019t believe me, take a look at the cycling commuters passing you every day and see if you can spot <em>any</em> of them using their dropped handlebars.</p> <p>The Roadlite:ON is responsive and lively. It takes the grind out of commuting and \u2013 even if you are getting a bit of help from its electric motor \u2013 it raises your pulse. There\u2019s a touchpad on which you can flick between the bike\u2019s three power assistance modes: Breeze, River and Rocket.

      "body": "<p>For anyone aspiring to longevity in popular music, the west country duo of Steve Knightley and Phil Beer offer valuable lessons. The pair got together in 1986 and this, remarkably, is their 18th studio album. It helps to have a prodigious and original singer-songwriter like Knightley, who contributes eight new numbers here, ranging over subjects as disparate as grownup heartache (You\u2019ll Get By), the lure of Cornwall (Dreckley) and Exeter\u2019s 6 Rifles regiment (Swift and Bold).

The pair got together in 1986 and this, remarkably, is their 18th studio album. It helps to have a prodigious and original singer-songwriter like Knightley, who contributes eight new numbers here, ranging over subjects as disparate as grownup heartache (You\u2019ll Get By), the lure of Cornwall (Dreckley) and Exeter\u2019s 6 Rifles regiment (Swift and Bold). Consummate musicianship also comes in handy, with multi-instrumentalist Beer contributing dramatic fiddle parts, augmented by bassist Miranda Sykes and bodhr\u00e1n player Cormac Byrne. On Mother Tongue, written after 2016\u2019s Brexit vote, they are joined by Johnny Kalsi, don of the dhol drum, for a Bhangra-Morris fusion, and by ambient wizard Gerry Diver on Forfarshire, a Kirsty Merryn song about lighthouse hero Grace Darling.

This disc made me wish I had. \u2022 Marta Fontanals-Simmons and pianist Lana Bode have championed modern repertoire in their debut album, I and Silence: Women\u2019s Voices in American Song (Delphian): from Aaron Copland, Dominick Argento and Samuel Barber to George Crumb (all men, but many of the song texts are by women, including Emily Dickinson). Especially worthwhile for Peter Lieberson\u2019s cycle of five Rilke settings, touchingly done. \u2022 For another singer associated with place, listen to Nightingale of the Nile (BBC Sounds), a documentary by the guitarist and composer Justin Adams about the life of 20th-century Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum \u2013 a musical legend who helped shaped Adams\u2019s own musical life.",

Yes please.</p> <p>We order their sourdough. In a city that now fetishises this bread as if it were the one true loaf, OKN1 holds its own: a crisp crust, a springy crumb and just enough acidity to remind you why the word sour is in the title without making you wince. For starters we have a perfect bit of classical training made flesh: a ham hock and chicken terrine, served at room temperature so the light glazing of jelly is starting to melt. Too often terrines end up overly compressed, by a kitchen fearful the damn thing will fall apart, when what they really need is a sharp knife to cut it. This is loosely textured, and robustly seasoned, and shiny with olive oil and cracked black pepper. It comes with thick slices of still-warm brioche and their own fig chutney, which is dark and glossy and heavy with full fruit. No, not ground-breaking, just a really good starter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"495b9e5221007ffa3103ea01aaae277cde0a8a20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/495b9e5221007ffa3103ea01aaae277cde0a8a20/94_54_4788_2873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Executed well\u2019: moules marini\u00e8re.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Executed well\u2019: moules marini\u00e8re.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a salad of hot smoked salmon and baby gem, with lightly charred corn kernels, dressed with the glint of pomegranate seeds and a bold vinaigrette. We follow that with two dishes nicked wholesale from the menu at <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/jan/08/cablegirlrobinsnest\" title=\"\">Robin\u2019s Nest</a></em> (look it up, kids): moules marin\u00e8re and a chicken Kiev. Some of you will now be dreaming of simpler times when there were three TV channels. Others may think it all sounds a little too basic.</p> <p>But I\u2019d much prefer a trainee cook who can make these dishes well, over one who knows how to take a blowtorch to a mackerel or thinks partnering lamb with granola is a good idea. The mussels are big meaty numbers in a thick broth that is the blessed union of smoked bacon, slow-cooked onions and cider, invited to hang out in each other\u2019s company for as long as it takes. The chicken Kiev is plump and crisp, and filled with a righteous basting of garlic butter. It perches on a thick lake of white bean pur\u00e9e punched up with Marmite butter, the closest they come to a culinary flourish.</p> <p>Chips are hand-cut, hot and crisp. Green beans come under a snowfall of grated parmesan with the poke and fire of fresh red chilli. Desserts, a prosecco and raspberry posset, and a strawberry and citrus shortbread cheesecake, both presented in a tumbler, could be dismissed as mere creamy things in a bowl. But both come with their own bit of oven-warm baking. The posset is double-cream-thick, crusted with sugar and chocolate sprinkles, and accompanied by crisp shortbread biscuits that snap between fingers and teeth; the cheesecake cream has blitzed digestive crumb below and chopped strawberries above and on the side, night-black sugar charcoal biscuits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18daf759ba4a83649a39cc3a11840ffd14198518\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18daf759ba4a83649a39cc3a11840ffd14198518/482_467_4663_2798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The glint of pomegranate seeds\u2019: smoked salmon salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The glint of pomegranate seeds\u2019: smoked salmon salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a mildly featureless dining room inside with chairs that, like those dishes\u2019 titles, also recall <em>Robin\u2019s Nest</em>. But then this is a functional inner-city college restaurant. The key thing is that it functions very well. Tonight, however, it is empty. Instead we eat on the terrace out the back overlooking the college lawn, one of those bits of lush greenery the inner city keeps to itself, where urban foxes scamper shamelessly. </p> <p>A terrine, a chicken Kiev, a cheesecake. Or instead, a salad, moules marini\u00e8re and a posset. These are not menus for which trumpets will be sounded. But executed well by skilled chefs in waiting, at a fair price, they are deeply heartening. The future of the restaurant business could be in good hands. All it needs is a few more customers. If you like eating out, do your bit for the industry and go there. Trust me, it won\u2019t be a sacrifice.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>The highly regarded catering course at the Lake District\u2019s Kendal College closed their stand-alone training restaurant, Castle Dairy, in March.

We follow that with two dishes nicked wholesale from the menu at Robin\u2019s Nest (look it up, kids): moules marin\u00e8re and a chicken Kiev. Some of you will now be dreaming of simpler times when there were three TV channels. Others may think it all sounds a little too basic. But I\u2019d much prefer a trainee cook who can make these dishes well, over one who knows how to take a blowtorch to a mackerel or thinks partnering lamb with granola is a good idea. The mussels are big meaty numbers in a thick broth that is the blessed union of smoked bacon, slow-cooked onions and cider, invited to hang out in each other\u2019s company for as long as it takes. The chicken Kiev is plump and crisp, and filled with a righteous basting of garlic butter. It perches on a thick lake of white bean pur\u00e9e punched up with Marmite butter, the closest they come to a culinary flourish. Chips are hand-cut, hot and crisp. Green beans come under a snowfall of grated parmesan with the poke and fire of fresh red chilli. Desserts, a prosecco and raspberry posset, and a strawberry and citrus shortbread cheesecake, both presented in a tumbler, could be dismissed as mere creamy things in a bowl. But both come with their own bit of oven-warm baking. The posset is double-cream-thick, crusted with sugar and chocolate sprinkles, and accompanied by crisp shortbread biscuits that snap between fingers and teeth; the cheesecake cream has blitzed digestive crumb below and chopped strawberries above and on the side, night-black sugar charcoal biscuits. There is a mildly featureless dining room inside with chairs that, like those dishes\u2019 titles, also recall Robin\u2019s Nest. But then this is a functional inner-city college restaurant. The key thing is that it functions very well. Tonight, however, it is empty. Instead we eat on the terrace out the back overlooking the college lawn, one of those bits of lush greenery the inner city keeps to itself, where urban foxes scamper shamelessly. A terrine, a chicken Kiev, a cheesecake. Or instead, a salad, moules marini\u00e8re and a posset. These are not menus for which trumpets will be sounded. But executed well by skilled chefs in waiting, at a fair price, they are deeply heartening. The future of the restaurant business could be in good hands. All it needs is a few more customers. If you like eating out, do your bit for the industry and go there. Trust me, it won\u2019t be a sacrifice. News bites The highly regarded catering course at the Lake District\u2019s Kendal College closed their stand-alone training restaurant, Castle Dairy, in March. They now run a service three lunchtimes and one evening a week, from within the college during termtime, starting this Tuesday. Three courses at lunch costs \u00a313.50 and could include mushroom and chorizo soup with a chive dressing followed by spinach and ricotta roulade. The Thursday evening service costs \u00a324. kendal.ac.uk Starting 30 September, Parker\u2019s Tavern in Cambridge is running a monthly series of dinners called Rubbish Cooks. The three-course menu prepared by chef Tristan Welch will utilise fruit and vegetables destined for the waste bin, alongside \u2018classically disregarded parts of fish and meat\u2019. It costs \u00a320, which only covers service and a donation to Cambridge night shelter charity Jimmy\u2019s.

He\u2019s been appearing on British television for eight years. After outrage on social media he was granted permanent residency within 24 hours.

The motion called for the government to \u201cpursue increasing the welfare system to make it adequate in supporting Australians in meeting their basic needs and enabling dignified participation in a modern economy\u201d. In a speech the Nationals leader Michael McCormack gave his personal support to a national rollout of the cashless debit card. \u201cThis is a bit controversial, we know that, but the cashless debt card is not punitive,\u201d McCormack said. He said \u201cthe evidence was there for all to see\u201d that it was effective, citing drops in youth unemployment in Queensland trials. McCormack claimed trials had shown the card reduced harm from alcohol and drugs, and encouraged personal financial responsibility. The impact of the card, which quarantines up to 80% of a person\u2019s welfare payment for restricted spending, is in dispute. It is frequently accused of being specifically punitive. In 2017 research conducted on the South Australian trial in Ceduna found 49% of participants felt it had made their lives worse and only 22% reported improvements. The independent evaluation by Orima Research said there was limited evidence of an impact on crime rates, and it was unable to determine where the trial had succeeded or failed. In June 2018 the Australian National Audit Office found it was \u201cdifficult to conclude\u201d whether the card was reducing social harm. More than 21,000 people, of whom 83% are Indigenous, are already on income quarantining in the Northern Territory. Key criticisms of the NT\u2019s Basic Card have included social stigma and practical impediments, such as being unable to buy second-hand goods, provide cash for children\u2019s school excursions, and forcing remote-living people to drive a long way to a shop that accepts the card. On Saturday McCormack also launched the $100m National Water Grid Authority, an organisation set up to help secure Australia\u2019s long-term water supplies. Projections by WaterNSW have revealed regional parts of the state could run out of water as early as November, with data showing the worst-case scenario for the state if there\u2019s no rain or government intervention. The Nationals meeting also voted in favour of a motion to lobby the federal government to change labelling requirements on vegan food, preventing products such as soy milk, almond milk and vegan meat from being branded as such. Under current laws, only milk from cows can be labelled \u201cmilk\u201d without an added qualifier. \u201cI\u2019m not anti plant-based protein foods, I think they\u2019re going to have a role to play in the food proposition going forward,\u201d said agricultural minister and deputy Nationals leader, Bridget McKenzie. \u201cBut that means then we need to be very clear with consumers about what they\u2019re purchasing. \u201cSo if you want actual chicken, then that\u2019s what it should be called. If you want plant-based protein that tastes like chicken, then that\u2019s what it should called.\u201d An August report from IBIS World found the soy and almond milk production industry, which also included rice and coconut milk, was expected to have grown by 8.3% in five years by 2019/20. The growing market demand for non-dairy milk was attributed to consumer health concerns, and while soy milk had been the dominant non-dairy choice, its share of the market was declining against alternatives such as almond milk. Last week the United Dairyfarmers of Victoria voiced its support for the motion. \u201cChicken-free chicken? Isn\u2019t that an oxymoron?,\u201d the organisation said on its Twitter account. \u201cUsing names like milk, chicken and meat for plant-based alternatives greatly confuses consumers when looking to by healthy nutritious products.\u201d In a petition calling for a ban on non-dairy products using the word \u201cmilk\u201d, the Nationals Farmers\u2019 Federation said consumers were being \u201cmisled\u201d into thinking the products had equivalent nutrition.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s been 50 years since the formation of the Open University, now one of the largest universities in Europe. The <em>Observer Magazine </em>of 15 November 1970 looked ahead to the start of operations in January 1971 when \u201825,000 ordinary men and women\u2019 were about to realise \u2018the promise of belated academic qualifications\u2019. Alan Road\u2019s piece was headlined \u2018Do-it-yourself degrees\u2019 (though aren\u2019t all degrees that?)</p> <p>One of the first things the OU had to overcome was ignorance about how it would work. As Road put it: \u2018It will not be possible to obtain a degree by sitting down for a few nights and watching the telly.\u2019 In fact \u2018only 5% of a student\u2019s time will be spent viewing\u2019. Ironically enough, I spent at least 20% of my time at a regular university watching TV.</p> <p>There were worries about \u2018the loneliness of the long-distance learner\u2019. \u2018The nearest thing in sight to a dreaming spire is probably the transmitting mast at Alexandra Palace,\u2019 said Road, \u2018where television and radio programmes are being recorded in co-operation with the BBC.\u2019</p> <p>It\u2019s apposite that for such an egalitarian institution, where no entry qualifications were required, the OU campus at Walton Hall near Milton Keynes was built \u2018around a 26-room Georgian house that used to be the home of the local lord of the manor\u2019.</p> <p>When Harold Wilson first mooted the idea in 1963 (the arresting but misleading title of University of the Air was ditched) it was dismissed by some as \u2018quixotic\u2019 and \u2018gimmicky\u2019. Astonishing, then, that there were 42,000 applicants for courses.</p> <p>Equally eye-opening was that 7,000 chemistry sets were sent through the post to students. \u2018A collection of 50 chemicals will be included in the kit,\u2019 wrote Road, \u2018and though no Class One poisons will be included\u2026 students will be warned of the possible hazard to children.\u2019 What could possibly have gone wrong?</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been 50 years since the formation of the Open University, now one of the largest universities in Europe. The Observer Magazine of 15 November 1970 looked ahead to the start of operations in January 1971 when \u201825,000 ordinary men and women\u2019 were about to realise \u2018the promise of belated academic qualifications\u2019. Alan Road\u2019s piece was headlined \u2018Do-it-yourself degrees\u2019 (though aren\u2019t all degrees that?) One of the first things the OU had to overcome was ignorance about how it would work. As Road put it: \u2018It will not be possible to obtain a degree by sitting down for a few nights and watching the telly.\u2019 In fact \u2018only 5% of a student\u2019s time will be spent viewing\u2019. Ironically enough, I spent at least 20% of my time at a regular university watching TV. There were worries about \u2018the loneliness of the long-distance learner\u2019. \u2018The nearest thing in sight to a dreaming spire is probably the transmitting mast at Alexandra Palace,\u2019 said Road, \u2018where television and radio programmes are being recorded in co-operation with the BBC.\u2019 It\u2019s apposite that for such an egalitarian institution, where no entry qualifications were required, the OU campus at Walton Hall near Milton Keynes was built \u2018around a 26-room Georgian house that used to be the home of the local lord of the manor\u2019. When Harold Wilson first mooted the idea in 1963 (the arresting but misleading title of University of the Air was ditched) it was dismissed by some as \u2018quixotic\u2019 and \u2018gimmicky\u2019. Astonishing, then, that there were 42,000 applicants for courses. Equally eye-opening was that 7,000 chemistry sets were sent through the post to students. \u2018A collection of 50 chemicals will be included in the kit,\u2019 wrote Road, \u2018and though no Class One poisons will be included\u2026 students will be warned of the possible hazard to children.\u2019 What could possibly have gone wrong?",

Earlier he said the witness, superintendent Sussan Thomas, had been appointed as a \u201cdecoy\u201d. It was not Thomas\u2019s fault, he said.

Outside court, Day\u2019s eldest daughter, Belinda, said the decision of the chief commissioner not to provide a witness that could \u201canswer the questions that the court is asking\u201d was insulting. \u201c[It] just shows that there\u2019s a lack of respect for the court,\u201d Belinda Day said. \u201cThe coroner herself has requested that witness and her inability to answer those questions just shows a disregard to that.\u201d Inquests into deaths in custody follow a pattern. First the officers directly involved, police or prison, give evidence about their involvement with the deceased, pertinent details of which they cannot recall. Then comes the medical evidence and opinions from expert witnesses, who say the care of the deceased person was inadequate. Cases where care was adequate do not make the news. An investigation by Guardian Australia found Indigenous women were the least likely of any group to have received all appropriate medical care prior to their death in custody. The last phase of the inquest is always an executive of the responsible agency who will tell the family the agency is sorry for their loss but has not, according to folders of tabbed and highlighted documents, done anything wrong. They will explain that the officers involved had received a reprimand for any failure to follow procedure and set out a range of changes that have been introduced in an attempt to head off adverse findings by the coroner.

Countries that we in the UK have tended to disregard as wine producers, are now making bottles that are every bit as good as their counterparts in the west. Until recently, for example, most of us would have associated the Czech Republic and Slovakia with bitter medicinal digestifs and top-notch lager. But the two countries have always made wine, and these are regaining the reputation they had a century or more ago. From Slovakia, the best I\u2019ve tried recently is a riesling made by the great German winemaker Egon M\u00fcller at his brother-in-law\u2019s estate: Ch\u00e2teau Bela Riesling Dry 2017 (from \u00a322.99, <a href=\"http://novelwines.co.uk\" title=\"\">Novel Wines</a>; <a href=\"http://Selfridges.com\" title=\"\">Selfridges</a>) is fine-boned, super-fresh and elegant. From the Czech Republic, I really fell for the local p\u00e1lava grape as grown by Sonberk in the brightly lit cool-climate of Moravia with its succulent tropical fruit and fresh herbiness.</p> <p><strong>Jako Vino Stina Posip, Dalmatia, Croatia 2017 (from \u00a323.99, <a href=\"http://allaboutwine.co.uk\" title=\"\">All About Wine</a>; <a href=\"http://strictlywine.co.uk\" title=\"\">Strictly Wine</a>; <a href=\"http://corkingwines.co.uk\" title=\"\">Corking Wines</a>)</strong> Croatia is blessed with a profusion of grape varieties in its island and mainland wine regions. Perhaps the most celebrated combination of grape and place in the country is the malvasia of the Istrian peninsula, which leads to brisk, pithy, sea-salty fresh but brightly fruited dry whites such as Kozlovic Malvasia, Istria 2018 (from \u00a312.29, <a href=\"http://strictlywine.co.uk\" title=\"\">Strictly Wine</a>; <a href=\"http://fintrywines.co.uk\" title=\"\">Fintry Wines</a>). On the Peljesac peninsula of the Dalmatian coast, meanwhile, it\u2019s the red grape plavac mali that is the stand out in sweetly dark fruited reds such as Badel Plavac Mali 2017 (\u00a310.83, <a href=\"http://croatianfinewines.com\" title=\"\">Croatian Fine Wines</a>). And on the island of Brac, wine producers such as Jako Andabak of Jako Vino have been rebuilding and replanting vineyards on the white stone (\u201cstina\u201d) soils with very impressive results, not least in the gorgeous wine Andabak makes from the posip variety, a wine that ripples with stone fruited richness, citrussy pith and cool sea breeziness.</p> <p><strong>Gasper Pinot Grigio, Goriska Brda, Slovenia 2018 (from \u00a312.67, <a href=\"http://thefinewinecompany\" title=\"\">The Fine Wine Company</a>; <a href=\"http://nywines.co.uk\" title=\"\">Noel Young Wines</a>) </strong>Croatia\u2019s rival as currently the most interesting wine producer of the former Yugoslavian states is Slovenia. The country has a nice line in pristine, fruit-driven whites such as the consistently good Puklavec &amp; Friends Sauvignon Blanc-Pinot Grigio 2018 (\u00a38.75, <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/\" title=\"\">Waitrose</a>) from the northeastern Stajerska region, which brings such attractive freshly mowed meadow refreshment in this vintage. Even better in the same kind of modern, clean style is Gasper\u2019s Pinot Grigio from the Goriska Brda region on the border with northeast Italy, which presents the grape variety at its palate-coating, subtly spicy, quince-fruity best, with a lovely streak of citrussy freshness. But the country is also the home of some of Europe\u2019s best natural and orange wines, not least the brilliant wines of the Zorjan family in Stajerska, whose macerated combination of riesling and (unrelated) lazki riesling, Zorjan Cuv\u00e9e 2015 (\u00a327.50, <a href=\"http://lescaves.co.uk\" title=\"\">Les Caves</a>) is a spicy, herbal, tangy, inimitable.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

Until recently, for example, most of us would have associated the Czech Republic and Slovakia with bitter medicinal digestifs and top-notch lager. But the two countries have always made wine, and these are regaining the reputation they had a century or more ago. From Slovakia, the best I\u2019ve tried recently is a riesling made by the great German winemaker Egon M\u00fcller at his brother-in-law\u2019s estate: Ch\u00e2teau Bela Riesling Dry 2017 (from \u00a322.99, Novel Wines; Selfridges) is fine-boned, super-fresh and elegant. From the Czech Republic, I really fell for the local p\u00e1lava grape as grown by Sonberk in the brightly lit cool-climate of Moravia with its succulent tropical fruit and fresh herbiness. Jako Vino Stina Posip, Dalmatia, Croatia 2017 (from \u00a323.99, All About Wine; Strictly Wine; Corking Wines) Croatia is blessed with a profusion of grape varieties in its island and mainland wine regions. Perhaps the most celebrated combination of grape and place in the country is the malvasia of the Istrian peninsula, which leads to brisk, pithy, sea-salty fresh but brightly fruited dry whites such as Kozlovic Malvasia, Istria 2018 (from \u00a312.29, Strictly Wine; Fintry Wines). On the Peljesac peninsula of the Dalmatian coast, meanwhile, it\u2019s the red grape plavac mali that is the stand out in sweetly dark fruited reds such as Badel Plavac Mali 2017 (\u00a310.83, Croatian Fine Wines). And on the island of Brac, wine producers such as Jako Andabak of Jako Vino have been rebuilding and replanting vineyards on the white stone (\u201cstina\u201d) soils with very impressive results, not least in the gorgeous wine Andabak makes from the posip variety, a wine that ripples with stone fruited richness, citrussy pith and cool sea breeziness. Gasper Pinot Grigio, Goriska Brda, Slovenia 2018 (from \u00a312.67, The Fine Wine Company; Noel Young Wines) Croatia\u2019s rival as currently the most interesting wine producer of the former Yugoslavian states is Slovenia. The country has a nice line in pristine, fruit-driven whites such as the consistently good Puklavec &amp; Friends Sauvignon Blanc-Pinot Grigio 2018 (\u00a38.75, Waitrose) from the northeastern Stajerska region, which brings such attractive freshly mowed meadow refreshment in this vintage. Even better in the same kind of modern, clean style is Gasper\u2019s Pinot Grigio from the Goriska Brda region on the border with northeast Italy, which presents the grape variety at its palate-coating, subtly spicy, quince-fruity best, with a lovely streak of citrussy freshness. But the country is also the home of some of Europe\u2019s best natural and orange wines, not least the brilliant wines of the Zorjan family in Stajerska, whose macerated combination of riesling and (unrelated) lazki riesling, Zorjan Cuv\u00e9e 2015 (\u00a327.50, Les Caves) is a spicy, herbal, tangy, inimitable.

On Sunday Labor\u2019s shadow climate change spokesman gave a clear signal it will continue to oppose the legislation in an interview renewing his calls for an \u201cunsparing\u201d election review and refusing to recommit to a 45% emissions reduction target by 2030. On Saturday the Australian Financial Review reported the Morrison government is set to reintroduce legislation to give the treasurer power to compel companies to supply electricity on certain terms and for courts to force energy companies engaging in anti-competitive conduct to sell off assets. The bill was shelved before the election due to lack of Senate support and the risk of amendments hostile to coal, but Labor\u2019s leader Anthony Albanese has so far refused to state a position on the bill after the surprise May election defeat. Butler told ABC\u2019s Insiders that Labor would look to see if any changes had been made to the legislation but noted that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had \u201cexplicitly rejected\u201d the idea, suggesting it is not in consumers\u2019 interests. \u201cThe Energy Users Association representing the biggest users of electricity in this country also said they were concerned this bill would simply smash investor confidence and force power prices up,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s also the added concern that we pointed to that this appears to be a backdoor to privatising electricity assets in Queensland and [Western Australia] and Tasmania where their communities have time and time again rejected the idea that their publicly owned assets should be put in private hands. \u201cWe have some very serious concerns about this.\u201d Butler responded to a report that Labor may have to ditch its interim target of 45% emissions reduction by 2030 by noting that \u201call our policies are up for review\u201d since the election defeat. Butler said setting medium-term targets is still best practice but noted the 45% target was set in 2015, suggesting he could not put a precise number or year on a new target. \u201cWhat our position will be at 2022 at the election, obviously I\u2019m not in a position to announce four months out from the last election.\u201d He said Labor wanted to keep global warming below 1.5C and is committed to \u201cnet zero emissions by the middle of the century and medium-term targets consistent with those principles informed by the best scientific and economic advice\u201d. Butler criticised the Coalition for the drought minister David Littleproud denying knowledge of a link between climate change and bushfires \u2013 a position he later retracted \u2013 and Australia\u2019s record of steadily rising emissions. He said Scott Morrison would not attend the UN climate summit because Australia\u2019s 26% emissions reduction target is \u201cunanimously regarded as grossly inadequate, [and is] consistent instead with more like 3C or 3.5C of global warming which would be utterly catastrophic\u201d. Australia is set to miss the \u201cinadequate\u201d 2030 target \u201cby a mile\u201d, Butler said. Asked about ALP president Wayne Swan\u2019s view that Labor should stick to its tax-and-spend agenda to fix inequality, Butler replied that Swan was \u201cvery experienced\u201d and entitled to put the view but even he \u201caccepts \u2026 that this was a very deep election loss\u201d. Butler said Labor needed \u201csome deep reflection and that includes over our taxation policies, the spending commitments they were intended to fund, climate and energy and every other policy area\u201d because it lost its third election in a row, with the lowest primary vote in 100 years to an outfit \u201cMorrison himself described as the Muppet Show\u201d. Butler also rejected allegations of racism in Labor questioning the government about Liberal MP Gladys Liu\u2019s links to Chinese-government associations, noting it is pursuing the same questions as the national media. He attacked the Coalition\u2019s record, including former attorney general George Brandis\u2019s declaration people have \u201cthe right to be a bigot\u201d in the context of attempting to water down race hate speech laws, and Morrison\u2019s decision to label Sam Dastyari \u201cShanghai Sam\u201d when he was embroiled in a donations scandal.",
