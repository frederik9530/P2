The sector\u2019s woes continue, with restaurant numbers falling by 3.4% in the year to the end of June, with a net 18 closures each week. The decline is the sixth in succession reported in a quarterly survey of licensed premises by the research and consulting firms CGA and AlixPartners. It does not include takeaways or cafes. But while the industry continues to suffer, a handful of cuisines have bucked the trend, with figures for the past five years illustrating the shifting preferences of the modern British diner. Fans of jerk chicken and ackee and saltfish have helped to drive the number of Caribbean restaurants up by 144% to 117, boosted by a flurry of new openings by the Turtle Bay chain. The rise of the meat-free lifestyle resulted in a 69% surge for vegetarian restaurants to 88, while Turkish and Middle Eastern restaurants enjoyed surges of more than 60%, to a combined 668. Japanese restaurants, whose ranks have been bolstered by the runaway success of large chains such as Yo Sushi! and Wagamama, grew by 27% to 626. These fast-growing cuisines are still small compared to more established Indian, Italian and Chinese restaurants in the UK, but these old favourites account for the bulk of the industry\u2019s decline. The number of Italian restaurants fell 4.7% to 2,815, partly owing to the financial collapse suffered by Jamie\u2019s Italian, which shut 22 outlets after customers deserted the TV chef Jamie Oliver\u2019s chain. Indian restaurants suffered a 2.6% fall to 5,594, but the most precipitous decline was in Chinese food, where the number of restaurants slumped 7.3% to 2,074. Graeme Smith, managing director of AlixPartners, added: \u201cThe rapid growth of restaurants focused on certain cuisine types highlights how they can quickly find favour in response to the fast-changing tastes of British diners.\u201d Restaurant numbers had been rising for eight successive years until June 2018, when the bubble burst, amid a flurry of closures by struggling chains including Byron, Carluccio\u2019s and Prezzo. But although some of the best-known brands have been hit hard, chain restaurants are in better shape than independents.

This is one of the final taboos to smash through. \u201cLife after 50 is a great kind of different,\u201d she added. \u201cIt can be the best time of all: less stressful, less competitive, freer, happier, more joyful. Life at any age is there to embrace, so it\u2019s time we stopped using ageist language, intentional or not.\u201d The report found that Southhampton was the most ageist city in the UK, with 46% of residents admitting they had discriminated against someone on the basis of their age, and Bristol the least, with just 20% admitting ageism. More over-50s living in the West Midlands (42%) and Yorkshire (41%) believe that the problem of ageism is getting worse, more so than in any other UK region. Emma Twyning at the Centre for Ageing Better welcomed the report: \u201cThese subtle but damaging messages are everywhere, from the TV shows we watch featuring \u201cdoddery but dear\u201d characters and the \u201canti-ageing\u201d face creams we buy, to the constant media reports about the \u201cburden\u201d of our ageing population,\u201d she said. \u201cThe evidence suggests that this ageist societal narrative negatively impacts on our personal experiences of ageing and perhaps even our health and wellbeing.\u201d Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said: \u201cAgeism must become as unacceptable as every other form of discrimination.\u201d Shelley Hopkinson, public affairs manager at Independent Age, agreed, adding:\u201cpart of the problem is that people often don\u2019t even realise that the language they\u2019re using can be ageist or cause offence\u201d.",

The number of agreed sales rose by 6.1% year on year in the month to 10 August, according to property website Rightmove, which claims to track nine in 10 UK house purchases. House prices in the UK have mostly risen constantly since April 2012, according to the Office for National Statistics, but the pace of growth has collapsed since the June 2016 Brexit vote, from an annual rate of 8.2% to only 0.9% in June 2019. London and the south of England have registered price drops in recent months and housing market economists have highlighted the effect of Brexit uncertainty, as buyers hold out for the political chaos to subside before making long-term decisions. However, Miles Shipside, a director at Rightmove, said the latest figures suggest buyers are now looking to complete deals ahead of the latest Brexit deadline at the end of October. \u201cWhilst another approaching Brexit deadline is now nothing new for prospective buyers, this one may seem more definite, and therefore one to beat, with the government regarding this one as \u2018do or die\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the end of October Brexit outcome remains uncertain, more buyers are now going for the certainty of doing a deal, with some having perhaps hesitated earlier in the year.\u201d Historically low mortgage rates, amid intense competition among lenders to sign up new borrowers, have added to the incentive to push through purchases in short order, he added. \u201cThere\u2019s only so long that buyers and sellers can delay the familial, financial and emotional forces driving the need to move, and with the average time between agreeing a sale and moving in being more than three months, we\u2019re now entering the last chance saloon for those who want to have finished their move before the end of the year,\u201d said Shipside. \u201cWe often see an autumn activity bounce, but perhaps this year\u2019s political activities have brought that forward into a summer surge as buyers have gone bolder and earlier than usual.\u201d Glynis Frew, the chief executive of estate agent Hunters, said the volume of house sales was also fuelled by sellers keen to get deals done. \u201cMany vendors at this moment in time seem happy to demand slightly lower asking prices if it means they can get the deal out the door as quickly as possible in light of the ongoing Brexit uncertainty,\u201d she said. The rise in the volume of sales was felt in every part of the country but was most pronounced in the north-east and the east of England, and Yorkshire &amp; the Humber, with rises of over 10%. The average price of properties coming on to the market in the month to 10 August fell by \u00a33,192 compared to the previous month, to \u00a3305,500. That represented a 1% decrease, but prices remained 1.2% higher than the same month last year.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump and his chief trade advisers insisted on Sunday the US is not facing a recession which markets appear to fear and which could prove costly at the polls next year. In a 30-minute appearance before reporters in New Jersey, the president appeared impervious to danger. The characteristically freewheeling exchange covered his positions on trade, the economy, gun control and international relations. \u201cI don\u2019t see a recession,\u201d Trump said, preparing to fly to Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re doing tremendously well. Our consumers are tremendously rich. They\u2019re loaded up with money. Walmart is through the roof. We\u2019re not going to have a recession \u2013 the world is in a recession right now.\u201d Competitors including Germany, the European union and the UK and \u201ca lot of countries are not doing as well like we\u2019re doing\u201d, he said, adding again his contention that \u201cthe world is in a recession right now\u201d. Trump also repeated familiar claims that his policy of trade war with China is working rather than rebounding on US consumers and business, saying Beijing \u201cwants to come the negotiating table\u201d. \u201cChina\u2019s doing very poorly \u2013 the worst in 27 years \u2013 because of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are losing millions of jobs in China. We\u2019re not paying for the tariffs, China is paying for the tariffs. Other countries maybe but in the case of China, China is eating the tariffs \u2013 at least so far.\u201d Analysts disagree with many of Trump\u2019s claims but contrary opinions rarely change his thinking. In a familiar move on Sunday morning, senior White House advisers were sent out to preach the gospel of enduring prosperity. Speaking to ABC\u2019s This Week, trade adviser Peter Navarro defended US policy, predicted a \u201cstrong economy through 2020\u201d and disputed a bond-market indicator of approaching recession that this week sent stocks into their largest one-day sell-off this year. On Fox News Sunday, economic adviser Larry Kudlow insisted: \u201cThere\u2019s no recession on the horizon. What\u2019s wrong with a little optimism?\u201d On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Kudlow was confronted with a similar statement made in his National Review column in late 2007 \u2013 right before a global recession. He \u201cpleaded guilty\u201d but pointed out other experts had made similar predictions. Pessimism is spreading among Republicans. Trump\u2019s approval rating remains stubbornly low and fear is rife that economic reversal will lead to electoral defeat. Navarro, the leader of the White House\u2019s controversial China policy, claimed the bond-market indicator \u2013 a reversed spread in yields between long-term and short-term bonds \u2013 had not in fact occurred. \u201cWe did not have a yield curve inversion right now, by technical standpoints,\u201d Navarro told ABC. \u201cIt is flat, not for bad reasons, but for good reasons.\u201d \u201cI can tell you with certainty that we\u2019re going to have a strong economy through 2020 and beyond,\u201d he said. Attempting to calm economic anxiety that on Wednesday triggered an 800-point selloff on the Dow Jones industrial average, Navarro predicted that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in mid-September. \u201cAll what needs to happen here,\u201d he said, \u201cis for the Federal Reserve to do what it needs to do, which is begin lowering interest rates.\u201d That would make the economy return to a \u201cbullish cycle\u201d. Trump told supporters in New Hampshire this week they had \u201cno choice but to vote for me\u201d if they wanted to thrive. But an increasing number of Americans do not share such confidence.

In recent years a host of women\u2019s teams have buckled under the financial pressures of trying to maintain full-time professionalism. Millwall Lionesses were one such team \u2013 on the brink of bankruptcy in April 2018 and crowdfunding for support. Only some late investment salvaged their season.</p> <p>That investment can now be revealed as having come from SETL, a London-based financial technology company that builds and deploys settlement and payment systems based on blockchain technology. It is the continuing sponsorship of SETL and commitment of its co-founder and chief engineer, Anthony Culligan, and his wife, Diane, who is chair of the London City Lionesses, that is driving and sustaining the club in its new form.</p> <p>There is some irony to how guarded their financial support for the club has been, given that blockchain is by its nature transparent. Every player is full-time and they have a Nike custom kit, access to psychologists and nutritionists, Triple S communications (who work with Toni Duggan, Wayne Rooney and Gareth Southgate among others) run their PR and every player has private medical care.</p> <p>There is lots of talk of doing things differently but the board are clear that they also want to do things properly and they stress they are \u201cacutely aware of the issues experienced by other clubs historically but have an experienced administrative team who are providing the appropriate strategic guidance\u201d. They include the former Lewes FC general manager Jack Heaselden.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all well and good for people to bang on about equality but it has to be more than words,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cLittle things like giving all the girls private medical care. I can\u2019t have a player who\u2019s injured and waiting six months on the NHS to receive an MRI scan and then another six months for surgery, then we\u2019ve lost a player for a year there.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard to take out special policies to make sure we get immediate MRIs, immediate surgeries, but it is the right thing to do. We can\u2019t keep banging on about equality for women\u2019s football without putting our money where our mouths are.\u201d</p> <p>Private medical care is something Phillips feels should be an FA requirement. \u201cThe FA should go out and negotiate a deal for all the clubs,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s 23 teams across the Women\u2019s Super League and Championship. If the FA was to go and maybe negotiate a deal I think a) they\u2019d get it at a better price and b) every single player would then be looked after.\u201d</p> <p>With the top tiers of the women\u2019s pyramid slowly moving towards being a mirror of the men\u2019s with every WSL team affiliated to a men\u2019s club, the move by London City Lionesses perhaps offers a new way of doing things. But it is only a new way of doing things in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/14/womens-super-league-professional-success-top-clubs-sponsorship-crowds\" title=\"\">England</a>. In the US and Europe, with clubs like Turbine Potsdam, it is much more commonplace to have standalone women\u2019s clubs. There are models that London City Lionesses can draw on.</p> <p>\u201cWith it being the first club to be fully separate is pretty unique,\u201d says the full-back Leanne Cowan. \u201cThere is an attraction for sponsors who can work with a team that are going out on their own and showing women we can do it and we don\u2019t need the male set-up there as well.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very empowering and certain brands will want to latch on to that and work with us to promote that because we live in a society nowadays that is all about empowering women and equality.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/13/referee-stephanie-frappart-assistants-breaking-new-ground\">St\u00e9phanie Frappart takes centre stage in big moment for women in football | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the midfielder Liz Ejupi there is a pressure to fly the flag for the new model on the pitch. \u201cAll of this talk, growing up, we only wanted to see the game be bigger and better,\u201d she says. Now we\u2019re wearing a badge that represents that.\u201d</p> <p>If it did affect them, it did not show. A header from Grace Neville eight minutes into their season opener against London Bees was added to by Lucy Fitzgerald in the second half \u2013 three points secured comfortably and a feeling that they are a far cry from the team that, in its previous form, picked up five points in the 2018-19 season.</p>",

That investment can now be revealed as having come from SETL, a London-based financial technology company that builds and deploys settlement and payment systems based on blockchain technology. It is the continuing sponsorship of SETL and commitment of its co-founder and chief engineer, Anthony Culligan, and his wife, Diane, who is chair of the London City Lionesses, that is driving and sustaining the club in its new form. There is some irony to how guarded their financial support for the club has been, given that blockchain is by its nature transparent. Every player is full-time and they have a Nike custom kit, access to psychologists and nutritionists, Triple S communications (who work with Toni Duggan, Wayne Rooney and Gareth Southgate among others) run their PR and every player has private medical care. There is lots of talk of doing things differently but the board are clear that they also want to do things properly and they stress they are \u201cacutely aware of the issues experienced by other clubs historically but have an experienced administrative team who are providing the appropriate strategic guidance\u201d. They include the former Lewes FC general manager Jack Heaselden. \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good for people to bang on about equality but it has to be more than words,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cLittle things like giving all the girls private medical care. I can\u2019t have a player who\u2019s injured and waiting six months on the NHS to receive an MRI scan and then another six months for surgery, then we\u2019ve lost a player for a year there. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard to take out special policies to make sure we get immediate MRIs, immediate surgeries, but it is the right thing to do. We can\u2019t keep banging on about equality for women\u2019s football without putting our money where our mouths are.\u201d Private medical care is something Phillips feels should be an FA requirement. \u201cThe FA should go out and negotiate a deal for all the clubs,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s 23 teams across the Women\u2019s Super League and Championship. If the FA was to go and maybe negotiate a deal I think a) they\u2019d get it at a better price and b) every single player would then be looked after.\u201d With the top tiers of the women\u2019s pyramid slowly moving towards being a mirror of the men\u2019s with every WSL team affiliated to a men\u2019s club, the move by London City Lionesses perhaps offers a new way of doing things. But it is only a new way of doing things in England. In the US and Europe, with clubs like Turbine Potsdam, it is much more commonplace to have standalone women\u2019s clubs. There are models that London City Lionesses can draw on. \u201cWith it being the first club to be fully separate is pretty unique,\u201d says the full-back Leanne Cowan. \u201cThere is an attraction for sponsors who can work with a team that are going out on their own and showing women we can do it and we don\u2019t need the male set-up there as well. \u201cIt is very empowering and certain brands will want to latch on to that and work with us to promote that because we live in a society nowadays that is all about empowering women and equality.\u201d For the midfielder Liz Ejupi there is a pressure to fly the flag for the new model on the pitch. \u201cAll of this talk, growing up, we only wanted to see the game be bigger and better,\u201d she says. Now we\u2019re wearing a badge that represents that.\u201d If it did affect them, it did not show. A header from Grace Neville eight minutes into their season opener against London Bees was added to by Lucy Fitzgerald in the second half \u2013 three points secured comfortably and a feeling that they are a far cry from the team that, in its previous form, picked up five points in the 2018-19 season.",

The demands are high and, as such, so are the chances of those concerned breaking down altogether. \u201cNo player should play 50 or 60 games a season, especially not in these intense [midfield] positions,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cGive whatever you have and next game maybe somebody else will do the job and you will come on or whatever. That\u2019s the plan but we can only do that if they all stay fit. Last season we couldn\u2019t do that and the year before we couldn\u2019t do that \u2013 we went to the Champions League final in 2018 with the only three midfielders we had and last season we had only four midfielders for the last 10 or 12 games. Now they\u2019re all back and we will use all of them.\u201d They are not actually \u201call back\u201d given Ke\u00efta is sidelined with a muscle strain, while Fabinho and Henderson were relegated to the bench at St Mary\u2019s because, as Klopp put it, they were \u201ckilled\u201d following their exertions in the Super Cup win over Chelsea. In the game itself, Milner required stitches and the use of a headband following a collision with James Ward-Prowse. All of which rather backs up Klopp\u2019s insistence that all his midfielders cannot play all the time, and in that regard it is encouraging for Liverpool that Lallana is fit following his various injury problems and Oxlade-Chamberlain also appears to be fully up to speed having missed a year\u2019s worth of football due to a knee injury. The 26-year-old was excellent against Southampton in his first league start since 14 April 2018, particularly in the second half as he operated in an advanced midfield role, his movement and use of ball too much at times for those in his former club\u2019s colours. \u201cIt was nice to be back out there,\u201d said Oxlade-Chamberlain, a sentiment shared by Klopp as he went on to describe the player as \u201cspecial\u201d. He is also another option in a midfield that will continue to change \u2013 Klopp has already used three different three-man combinations across Liverpool\u2019s four games this season \u2013 and which, if managed correctly, could play a significant role in the Merseysiders finally getting their hands on a 19th league title, having stolen an early march on Manchester City following their draw with Tottenham. \u201cIt\u2019s not important how long you play, it\u2019s important how good you play,\u201d added Klopp. \u201cWe have to make sure our midfielders play as good as possible as often as possible.\u201d",

So when an episode like this comes along that contains not one but two genuine wins for the heroes, we\u2019re left blinking in shock. Two Commanders down, how many more to go? It\u2019s not many, but it\u2019s a start.</p> \n<p>We hit the ground running with June talking Eleanor out of shooting Commander Lawrence, in a scene in which Eleanor becomes one of the first Gilead characters ever to vocalise the awful things done to June: \u201cYou were raped because of him. You were brutalised.\u201d Eleanor\u2019s not just talking about last week\u2019s Ceremony, but about everything Gilead has done to June and countless other victims. But, as June says, all of this has to add up to something. June must believe her suffering can bring about some good, in order to give some meaning to it all. And for that to happen, she needs Lawrence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"496c77532c1c29c399de3dbd7da5ed211335b7f8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/496c77532c1c29c399de3dbd7da5ed211335b7f8/0_154_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We hit the ground running ...

He claims his priority is to protect Eleanor, but there\u2019s a hefty streak of cowardice and self-preservation in this petty and shallow man who robbed museums to turn his house into what June brilliantly terms \u201cthe attic of MOMA\u201d. He only agreed to June\u2019s plan because his own fails, and his only other option is death for both himself and Eleanor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbf97746f69e7c470c589184176e211385db1268\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbf97746f69e7c470c589184176e211385db1268/0_82_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"June at Jezebel\u2019s striking a deal with a bartender/child smuggler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">June at Jezebel\u2019s striking a deal with a bartender/child smuggler.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasper Savage/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Luckily, June has balls enough for both of them. She re-enters Jezebel\u2019s to do a deal with bartender/smuggler Billy to get the kids out, and, unsurprisingly, runs into trouble in the form of indiscriminate letch Commander Winslow.

Who didn\u2019t cheer when she kicked Winslow in the face, and stabbed him again and again with a pen before finally bludgeoning him to death? Sure, it won\u2019t change anything in the grand scheme of Gilead, but damn that felt good to watch. Luckily for June, Jezebel\u2019s Marthas are hardcore, and even though Lawrence warns June that \u201cthey\u2019ll be coming for us,\u201d we wouldn\u2019t be so sure \u2013 it looks like the Marthas have destroyed the evidence.

On their way to a clandestine meeting with Mark Tuello, the American representative, they reassess their relationship, longing for a return to the good old days of being able to read and write and not having to rape people. Fred claims to want to raise their daughter in solitude, free from politics. \u201cI don\u2019t need all the pomp and circumstance,\u201d he swears, but we would beg to differ. Fred likes to play at being a \u2018nice guy\u2019, but always reverts back to the grubby, power-hungry little man he truly is. He might joke about being \u201cthe man behind the woman\u201d, had Gilead not taken over, but we know Fred could never have tolerated being surpassed by a mere woman.</p> \n<p>But his days of having his power fantasies backed up by Gilead are over, as Tuello leads them into comically Canadian-looking territory and springs the trap, arresting Fred as a war criminal. The big question now is whether this was Serena\u2019s plan all along \u2013 to earn her freedom, and custody of Nicole, by bringing Fred to the US government-in-exile \u2013 or whether Tuello was playing both of them. Yvonne Strahovski plays the scene ambiguously enough to keep us guessing.</p> \n<h2><strong>The sound of music</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pllRW9wETzw\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pllRW9wETzw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Fred and Serena listen to Radio Free America on their roadtrip, tuning out for the talky bits but taking advantage of the illicit radio station\u2019s quality tracklist.

Over the years, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale has battered us down with disappointment after disappointment, to the point that an episode can be seen as light relief if it doesn\u2019t include any rapes or beatings. So when an episode like this comes along that contains not one but two genuine wins for the heroes, we\u2019re left blinking in shock. Two Commanders down, how many more to go? It\u2019s not many, but it\u2019s a start.

Season three has done a good job of shining a light on the Marthas \u2013 the true bad-asses of Gilead. The Waterfords A far bigger blow to Gilead than Winslow\u2019s seedy murder is what happens to the Waterfords. On their way to a clandestine meeting with Mark Tuello, the American representative, they reassess their relationship, longing for a return to the good old days of being able to read and write and not having to rape people.

But his days of having his power fantasies backed up by Gilead are over, as Tuello leads them into comically Canadian-looking territory and springs the trap, arresting Fred as a war criminal. The big question now is whether this was Serena\u2019s plan all along \u2013 to earn her freedom, and custody of Nicole, by bringing Fred to the US government-in-exile \u2013 or whether Tuello was playing both of them. Yvonne Strahovski plays the scene ambiguously enough to keep us guessing. The sound of music Fred and Serena listen to Radio Free America on their roadtrip, tuning out for the talky bits but taking advantage of the illicit radio station\u2019s quality tracklist. Hey, a jam\u2019s a jam, right? They listen to Doin\u2019 Me Right by The Classmen and Let\u2019s Twist Again by Chubby Checker. Portishead\u2019s Only You plays in Jezebel\u2019s, while the episode closes, in true Handmaid\u2019s Tale form, with yet another big track by an iconic female artist, this time Kate Bush\u2019s Cloudbusting. \u201cI just know that something good is going to happen,\u201d Bush sings, speaking for all of our hopes after this episode. Under his eye The speed and calmness with which the Marthas at Jezebel\u2019s disposed of a body and cleaned up a crime scene makes you wonder just how regularly this sort of thing happens there. Lawrence admits that they \u201coverlooked\u201d mental health and maternal love when he and his cronies founded Gilead. The place truly is run by a bunch of sociopaths. The \u2018econodaughter\u2019 living peacefully with her family in the middle of nowhere likes the colour of Serena\u2019s dress. Does she understand the meaning of it? Do even small-town econodaughters dream of being wives one day? Where did June get her Jezebel\u2019s outfit from? They don\u2019t seem like the sort of thing Eleanor would ever have worn, or Lawrence would \u2018collect\u2019. Maybe the Martha network helped with the Louboutins too.",

      "body": "<p>Man alive. Ross is at the bottom of an empty well! With Ned hanged and Demelza distracted by the stealing of the ore, who will save him now? Although perhaps a more realistic question is: how much more fake jeopardy can our blood pressure take, \u2018Darkers? I don\u2019t know if I can stand much more of this. Which is just as well, as there are only two episodes to go.</p> \n<p>There has been a tension this series between what\u2019s going on (the plot) and what we really care about (the characters). Most of the plot has been about the characters we care about the least. This came to a head in this tricky outing. The trouble with the Ned storyline is that no one apart from Ross likes Ned. We don\u2019t give a fig if falsehood and tyranny are vanquished; we just want Ross and Demelza to be happy. Plus, Ned was so evidently set up that there was no point resisting in the first place. And the bit with the pardon-that-wasn\u2019t-a-pardon was pointless melodrama. \u201cOh, good, you\u2019re just going to hang me and not disembowel and behead me. Thanks, prime minister.\u201d</p> \n<p>The trial scene was entertaining, especially when Ross took to the stand. Do not disrespect Ned, he argued. He has always been in service to the crown! He has dug ditches! He has done the full Joe Wicks programme in prison to keep himself trim for his celebratory exit gavotte! Set him free! I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d want Dr Enys telling everyone that you\u2019re probably not guilty, you\u2019re just brain-damaged. But never mind. The judge\u2019s sentence was shocking, especially in view of the jury expressly asking for mercy. It was almost as if it was a setup, paid for by Sir Evil George and the slave traders \u2026</p> \n<p>Of course Ross was always going to break Ned out of jail. With Ned disguised as Benny from Crossroads, this was one of the noisiest and least discreet prison breaks ever. And in the middle of it, Ned \u2013 already extremely annoying \u2013 decided he definitely didn\u2019t want to get into a sewer and escape anyway. \u201cLeave me here, and go finish what I could not.\u201d No idea how Ross managed to do a reverse prison break without punching Ned.</p> \n<p>I wondered, too, about Sir Evil George\u2019s cruelty towards Geoffrey Charles. After all, he is Elizabeth\u2019s son. And unlike some of the other young people in Sir Evil George\u2019s life, he is clearly not Ross\u2019s son. No matter. Geoffrey Charles gave as good as he got, emboldened by his witch-finder general\u2019s hat. \u201cHer heart belonged to one man only. And it wasn\u2019t my father and it wasn\u2019t you.\u201d (Yes! It was Ross Poldark!) And then we had this zinger of an exchange: \u201cI gave myself body and soul to Geoffrey Charles.\u201d \u201cSo if you wed her, you will always wonder \u2026 Is your first child mine or yours?\u201d Holy moly! For once I felt sorry for Cary Warleggan who must be exhausted with all these shenanigans, especially at his age. He\u2019s right, of course: we definitely need considerably more pliable females.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82e1889f73eb0d60ae42caedde0e8354da8d1c27\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82e1889f73eb0d60ae42caedde0e8354da8d1c27/0_29_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cary Warleggan must be exhausted with all these shenanigans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cary Warleggan must be exhausted with all these shenanigans.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC/Mammoth Screen</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In Cornwall Jacka was busy stealing sacks of rocks or similar. I wasn\u2019t sure they would do the smuggling in broad daylight, or that Demelza with her flaming red hair would spy on them in broad daylight. Again: better not to think too much about these things. In happy news, there was quite a bit of Prudie in this episode. In even happier news, Morwenna has finally let Drake near her. \u201cIf it were up to I, I would never leave this bed.\u201d All we need now is for Tess and Sir Evil George to replace Ross in the well, Rosina to marry Sam and Kitty to have her lovely baby. I am sure this can be managed in two episodes.</p> \n<h2>Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor</h2> \n<p>\u201cDr Enys will do whatever is required.\u201d \u201cCaroline, are you mad?\u201d I love the double act of Dr Enys and Sindy Doll, with or without Horace the Pug. A great partnership built by two brilliant actors (Luke Norris as the good doctor and Gabriella Wilde as Caroline Enys nee Penvenen). We really aren\u2019t seeing enough of them this series. But in the moments where they intervene, they light up the screen. And Dr Enys seems able to carry the anachronistic elements more convincingly than any other character. (\u201cGuys, have you heard of mental health? It\u2019s, like, really important to be compassionate towards the patient. Step away from the leeches.\u201d) I\u2019ve missed the interplay between Demelza and Caroline this season too. But \u2018e cannot have everything.</p> \n<p>A special mention must go to their corpulent sidekick. I\u2019ve recently found out that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sonny_the_pug_boy/\">Horace the Pug has an Instagram account</a> and has been moonlighting on the set of the movie Kingsman, where he had his own trailer. I thought you would want to know about this.</p> \n<h2>Classic Poldark lines</h2> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cThe pain will be all the keener when they come to be parted.\u201d Sir Evil George honouring Elizabeth\u2019s memory by destroying the life of her son. Well done, Sir Evil George.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cUncle Ross\u2019s friend should go free.\u201d Speak up, sweet Valentine! You see the truth.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cYou\u2019re breaking me out?\u201d \u201cDid you think this was a social call?\u201d Crazy banter.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cSo we will not lie together until we reach Gretna Green?\u201d Racy!</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cThere will be no other female.\u201d Females everywhere pray that this will stand.</p> \n<h2>Regulation reverse sexism bare chest moment</h2> \n<p>There was nothing of this kind here tonight for viewers in the Netherlands or anywhere else. Hopefully Ross\u2019s shirt \u2013 or maybe all his clothes \u2013 will melt off at the bottom of the well.</p> \n<h2>Next week</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s like Ross has melted off the face of the Earth! Everyone thinks Demelza is widowed! Tess be up to some wickedness (again). And Sindy Doll takes to her high horse.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c3dc92f8-9b66-4c99-b0b2-64553a6a54e6\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div

Not a bit of it. The PSG fans made their feelings known last week during last week\u2019s 3-0 defeat of N\u00eemes. He\u2019s not their son of a bitch any more, and the failure of a purported move to one of the Spanish giants would be a deeply embarrassing situation for all concerned. Who could have predicted that such a vanity move - from both parties - would go this way? And there will be no Philippe Coutinho, either, as he is off to Bayern Munich and not Paris. See what happens if you don\u2019t close the transfer window before the season starts? <br><br>Still, there\u2019s always Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, a better player than either of that aforementioned pair of Brazilians, as most would surely agree these days. And maybe less of the \u2018always\u2019. It may be high time for PSG fans to enjoy having him around until the call of Barcelona and Real Madrid tempts him. On with the football? Well, it would be one hell of a shock if PSG don\u2019t win this, just as is the case with any game they play in Ligue 1. Ander Herrera and Idrissa Gueye, two former Premier League midfield tyros, were their biggest new signings of the summer. <br><br>Rennes came away from Montpellier last week with a handy 1-0 win, and despite the dismissal of the striker Flavien Tait, suspended for this game.<br><br><strong>The game kicks off at 8pm UK time.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-18T14:39:31.908Z\">at 3.39pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "PSG\u2019s troubles extend way beyond whether Neymar stays or goes, judging by that. They were stodgy and lacking in ideas, too many egos even without His Nibs. Rennes look a decent unit, and in Camavinga have a star of the future. PSG\u2019s unbeaten record lasts just one game. Zut alors! And that\u2019s it! What a famous win for Rennes. And what an embarrassment for PSG. 90+3 min: Panic in the PSG box, as Salin flaps at the ball but Bernat cannot dig the ball out. Salin eventually recovers his positioning. A foul from the resultant corner eats up more time. 90+2 min: Camavinga almost scores! He scoops over when Boey carves down the wing and centres the ball. Such promise from that pair. 90+1 min: PSG could really have done with Neymar, Rennes not being so organised and good. 90 min: Into added time, of which there will be four minutes. PSG seem to want to foul their opposition as well as equalise. They have not been too disciplined. 89 min: Mbappe escaped, and Cavani threw himself at overhead kick. Boey\u2019s head was in the way, and he was brave. He managed to buy a vital free-kick. 88 min: Booking for Cavani for dissent. He\u2019s been dishing it out all night, if we are honest. PSG not liking it up \u2018em. Not at all. 86 min: After Rennes manage to hold the ball in the PSG half, Camavinga shapes to shoot and it looks goalbound. It takes Thiago Silva chucking himself in front of the ball to stop it flying in. 85 min: The ball is whipped off the feet of Cavani, just as Veratti had set up a volley. In the melee that follows, Lea Silik, the sub, is booked. 83 min: This is the point when Rennes are now tempted to sit back. They could not remain tireless forever. Morel stops Mbappe, who is now to be found across the attack. In the corner that follows, Mbappe tries to poke the ball through the legs of defender Boey. Rennes clear in panic. This will be a long last ten minutes or so. 81 min: A Mbapp\u00e9 cross turns into a shot and Roman Salin makes a fine save. Boey clears up the danger from the resultant corner. 79 min: Final Rennes sub: Sacha Boey comes on for Maouassa. A full-back change at this juncture is a risk, and Boey is just 18. 78 min: Sarabia, who was one of those double subs, fires in his second shot since coming on. He has room, but then blazes over. Thomas Tuchel looks even more haunted than normal. 76 min: Another Rennes sub: Benjamin Bourigeaud for James Lea Siliki. Final PSG sub: Draxler, who had a poor game, off for Leandro Paredes. 75 min: Some trickery from Camavinga buys some time, as he holds off two players, and wins a throw. When Niang goes down, PSG do not kick the ball out, being subscribers to the Lee Johnson school. 73 min: First Rennes sub: Del Castillo comes off for Jordan Siebatcheu, another striker. Julien St\u00e9phan yet to go defensive and wants to keep asking questions of PSG. 71 min: Just over 20 minutes for PSG to stop losing their first away game of the season. Mbappe, who is becoming prominent, tries to find Cavani but it fails. 70 min: Meanwhile, old man Mbapp\u00e9 flashes a shot wide of goal. Everyone stops being the young pretender at some point. 68 min: Top scout Richard Allen has been in contact. \u201cWhat did I say about my boy!! Marvellous!\u201d He was correct. Camavinga has been a revelation to me at least. Ah, the innocence of a young player. Let\u2019s hope he doesn\u2019t get derailed. He\u2019s been a pleasure to watch. 67 min: Another PSG booking, and it\u2019s Bernat who launches a foul on Camavinga, who expertly draws the challenge. Such promise from the 16-year-old. 66 min: Into the last 25 minutes and PSG are ragged and throwing the fouls in. Frustration growing. This has been an uncomfortable evening for them. 64 min: Those PSG subs have been a while in coming, but here they come. It\u2019s a double change. Di Maria is off for Pablo Sarabia, and then off goes Thomas Meunier for Colin Dagba. That\u2019s the right flank switched around, then. 62 min: Camavinga time, and what a ball he played out to the wing in a move that forced a corner. Grenier takes and then Jeremy Gelin hits the post with a flick. 61 min: Cavani gets a sniff of a chance when Veratti drifts the ball in. Rennes get it clear and Cavani cannot get a clean touch on it. 59 min: Activity on the PSG bench. Tuchel has seen enough and there will be some subs coming on. 58 min: Veratti booked for a foul on Mourel. He likes a foul, does Veratti. That\u2019s three yellow cards now. And Cavani might get another if he doesn\u2019t stop having a go at the linesman. 57 min: A break in play as Benjamin \u2018Violet\u2019 Bourigeaud leaves the field after a clash with Diallo. 55 min: Niang again? Was the hand involved? He looks through and everyone stops. The shot goes wide which means there is no need for the laissez-faire VAR to dimp his Gitanes and get involved. This style of video reffing seems to work a little better than the pernickety stuff you get out in Uxbridge. As in, it doesn\u2019t get involved. 54 min: Rennes look confident in possession. Meunier booked for a hack on Faitout Maouassa, who had escaped the full-back. 52 min: Traore fouls Mbappe, whose roulette fooled the defender for a while until he decided to kick out a leg to stop the flying machine. Di Maria takes, and Rennes clear before a foul clears their lines. 51 min: Rennes want more and PSG are shellshocked. Oh dear, Tuchel. Mbappe even seems to have slipped into the malaise. He plays a poor pass that Da Silva steps out to stop. 48 min: Camavinga, out on the left, cut in and floated in the ball and Del Castillo was on hand to head home, and he was unmarked. What a goal. And what a talent Camavinga looks. Power and skill. He could go far. Camavinga the supplier and Del Castillo heads home. 47 min: Camavinga shows his class, by turning and going into the heart of PSG\u2019s defence. Silva fouls him... 46 min: Close for Rennes! Del Castillo\u2019s shot/cross/whatever looped over Marquinhos and almost led to a goal as Areola was unsighted. We are back underway.... No Ander Herrera for PSG, as he\u2019s injured. Marquinhos has been manning the midfield today. Here\u2019s how you recover from a calf injury, it seems. If you like French football, this is the blog to start with. Tomorrow\u2019s edition might well feature a shock. That\u2019s a fair scoreline, since Rennes have played well aside from that Da Silva howler for Cavani\u2019s goal. What a fine strike that was from Niang. 45 min: Just a minute to be added on at the end of the half, and they are played out without incident. 44 min: How did that happen? Traore down the right, then across to Niang, who turned and drilled it past Areola. A fine goal, and one out of the blue. Wow, what a strike from Niang! 42 min: Draxler is booked for a foul on Morel, to whom he had just lost the ball and then hacked down. First yellow of the game. 40 min: Tuchel enjoyed that goal. There was plenty of relief. And relief must be a big part of being a PSG manager. 38 min: It almost gets worse for Da Silva, as Mbapp\u00e9 explodes beyond him, but hits the side-netting. There looked to be a shirt pull in there. Again, the VAR is on a fag break. PSG looking confident, Rennes ragged. 36 min: How did that happen? Rennes, who had previously kept things so tight, just fell apart. Da Silva played a no-look pass across goal Salin, his goalkeeper, and Cavani pounced. His 195th goal for PSG. Cavani capitalises on a mistake from Da Silva and scores! 35 min: Bernat is fouled and the Rennes count is mounting. Eventually, the ball comes to Meunier, and PSG get a corner. Di Maria takes, and a foul in the penalty box from Diallo means nothing comes of it.... 33 min: Has PSG\u2019s keeper, Areola, touched the ball? Rennes have had a couple of corners and maybe a shot wide but nothing of note. Still, it remains 0-0 and it is Rennes who are the happier team. 30 min: Excitement among the Rennes fans as Niang is the recipient of the ball but he is loose in possession, and not for the first time. Leonardo, up in the stands, and the PSG sporting director, is not happy. Is there a major club of such fragile moods in football than PSG? 28 min: This is not going according to plan for the champions. Rennes continuing to make life difficult. PSG have been slow, and Tuchel is having a right old moan to his assistants. 26 min: Camavinga and Veratti clash again, and the young Angolan looked to have cleaned out the Italian. Nothing given and VAR presumably sipping pastis back in Paris. 25 min: Camavinga reaches out a telescopic leg to stop Veratti robbing him of the ball to set up a counterattack. 23 min: PSG\u2019s buildup is slow as they look for space in a compressed Rennes defence. Veratti\u2019s ball is cleared and when it goes back in, Bernat, overlapping, cannot get to it. Tuchel looks pensive, as well he might. 21 min: Camavinga fouls Mbapp\u00e9, one star of the future fouls someone who is already a star. Between them, they are 36 years old. *Sobs* 19 min: Rennes doing OK here, pushing on, not sitting back. Impressive so far. 17 min: Grenier almost fashions a chance for Del Castillo, which leads to some hurried PSG defending. Two corners come, both of which are taken by Grenier. PSG try to clear their lines but Rennes are pushing on, and pressing hard. 15 min: It has to be said that the PSG doctors were not exactly quick in their response to a head injury to their star player. Mbapp\u00e9 is back on, and we must hope we are not dealing with a Steve Smith situation. 14 min: Mbappe is fouled and then clatters into Bernat\u2019s knee as he falls. He looks in pain, and not a little dazed. He\u2019s in some pain. That looks like it could be serious....while he\u2019s off the pitch, Di Maria launches a free-kick that Cavani heads against the post! 12 min: Now here\u2019s Camavinga and he shows off his talent in surging on through midfield, such that Cavani launches a tackle that you would these days refer to as a \u2018tactical foul\u2019. 10 min: Thiago Silva shows all his experience in cutting off a cross but Traore gets space to send Bernat one way, only to fire wide and not a little excitedly. Julien St\u00e9phan, the Rennes coach, claps his players\u2019 efforts. 8 min: Bernat is clipped by Traore, and it\u2019s a PSG free-kick that will be launched by Di Maria. He dinks it to Mbappe and the goalkeeper, Romain Salin, who was alert. 7 min: Our first glimpse of the much-heralded Camvinga sees him lose the ball in midfield. Ah well, he\u2019s got plenty to learn. PSG settling now into a pattern of dominance. 5 min: Di Maria swings in a cross, Bernat knocks the ball down and Draxler attempts a shot from distance. It flies wide. Tuchel is already asking for his team to step up their efforts. 2 min: Rennes\u2019 Niang forces a corner, which is taken by Bourigeaud, who makes a terrible mess of it. Di Maria almost makes an escape down the flank but is stopped in his tracks. 1 min: Mbapp\u00e9 begins with intent, and chases down the Rennes defence. Pressing, the Tuchel way. And away we go, with Rennes taking the kick-off. There is VAR in France, of course. Just to increase the tension, like. Thomas Tuchel is one the sideline and stooping to hi-five the PSG mascot. The teams are in the tunnel, and it\u2019s some atmosphere down in Brittany and they take to the pitch to some pyro mania. Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s dad is in the stands. If you want to feel old, then Eminem\u2019s Lose Yourself was number one in the US charts the day Eduardo Camavinga was born. It\u2019s fair to say that the Stade Rennais fans are up for this one. Lucas Ambielle has some thoughts: \u201cHi John. It\u2019s very nice that The Guardian is doing a MBM on a Ligue 1 game. Been a long time. On the issue of our Brazilian diva, Neymar is going to stay at Paris this season \u2018cause nobody is willing to pay that much money. Leonardo\u2019s communication this week to a french media hinted this way. As for the supporters, a couple of one-twos with Mbapp\u00e9 and 1 free kick in the top corner will make everyone friends again.\u201d According to L\u2019Equipe, PSG will play a 4-3-3. Angel Di Maria was preferred to Sarabia on the flank of the Paris attack. Thomas Meunier will be behind him alongside Thiago Silva, Diallo and Bernat for a four-man defence. Here\u2019s a reminder of the action so far in Ligue 1 this weekend, plus elsewhere. Rich Allen, of Get French Football, has done some scouting: \u201cI implore you to get on the Camavinga train. A 16 year old who has looked far beyond his years so far - including arguably a man of the match performance last week against Montpellier!\u201d Some more stats from the estimable Jonathan Johnson. Here\u2019s a more analogue version. And here is the PSG team via social media, a guessing game, though the big news is that there is no Neymar. Is that news? Here\u2019s the Rennes team. PSG team news imminent, hopefully. No Neymar, ney party? Not a bit of it. The PSG fans made their feelings known last week during last week\u2019s 3-0 defeat of N\u00eemes. He\u2019s not their son of a bitch any more, and the failure of a purported move to one of the Spanish giants would be a deeply embarrassing situation for all concerned. Who could have predicted that such a vanity move - from both parties - would go this way? And there will be no Philippe Coutinho, either, as he is off to Bayern Munich and not Paris. See what happens if you don\u2019t close the transfer window before the season starts? Still, there\u2019s always Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, a better player than either of that aforementioned pair of Brazilians, as most would surely agree these days. And maybe less of the \u2018always\u2019. It may be high time for PSG fans to enjoy having him around until the call of Barcelona and Real Madrid tempts him. On with the football? Well, it would be one hell of a shock if PSG don\u2019t win this, just as is the case with any game they play in Ligue 1. Ander Herrera and Idrissa Gueye, two former Premier League midfield tyros, were their biggest new signings of the summer. Rennes came away from Montpellier last week with a handy 1-0 win, and despite the dismissal of the striker Flavien Tait, suspended for this game. The game kicks off at 8pm UK time.",

After two months of clashes that have prompted severe warnings from Beijing and failed to win concessions from the city\u2019s government, huge crowds filled Victoria Park on Sunday afternoon and spilled on to nearby streets, braving torrential downpours. Australia\u2019s role as a leader in the global fossil fuel trade is underscored by a report that finds it is the world\u2019s third biggest exporter and fifth biggest miner of fossil fuel-related emissions. While political debate sometimes emphasises that Australia is responsible for 1.2% of global emissions at home, the analysis by progressive thinktank the Australia Institute says Australia is responsible for 7% of global fossil fuel exports based on their carbon dioxide potential. Scott Morrison will use a speech today to suggest that the \u201ctrust deficit\u201d in politics is worst among middle-income Australians, as he calls for greater use of corporate skills and diversity of viewpoints in the public service. In the address, which will be delivered to the Institute of Public Administration, the prime minister will suggest government ministers \u201cmust not allow a policy leadership vacuum to be created\u201d, while warning public servants they must be \u201can enabler of government policy not an obstacle\u201d. World Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a bombing at a wedding hall in Kabul that killed at least 60 people and injured more than 200. Survivors said the bomber was standing by a stage where children and adults were dancing and clapping when he detonated his explosives vest. A UN panel of experts has uncovered fragments of British-made laser guidance missile systems at an air raid site in Yemen, in a strike that it concluded breached international humanitarian law. The attacks took place in 2016, a month after then foreign secretary Boris Johnson said he was content to allow the export of weapons systems to Saudi Arabia. More than two dozen rescue workers are battling to save two cavers trapped in a cavern in the Tatra mountains in Poland, after a narrow tunnel flooded with water. A representative of the rescue service said it had not yet been possible to establish contact. New Zealand authorities are asking drivers to check their dashcams for footage of any hitchhikers near where the Australian surfer Sean McKinnon was killed. A man has faced court charged over the 33-year-old\u2019s shooting murder at Raglan on Friday. And a French waiter has been shot dead at a pizzeria on the outskirts of Paris for being \u201ctoo slow with a sandwich order\u201d, according to witnesses. Police have opened a murder investigation. Opinion and analysis There\u2019s a strange dissonance inherent in being a living, breathing, three-dimensional trans person at a time when the concept of your existence is framed as an abstract topic for debate, writes Allison Gallagher. \u201cGiven that so much of the reactionary media\u2019s focus is on the supposed idea that young people are being pressured into medical changes they will live to regret, it crosses one\u2019s mind that the end goal here is about creating and maintaining a situation in which young people cannot imagine a future for themselves where they are comfortably trans, happy, supported. I have no business assuaging fears by arguing that trans people are just like anyone else. What I do have business telling you is that I am filled with deep gratitude that I was given the support and resources to transition when I did, around six years ago.\u201d Leaked UK government documents show that a disorderly Brexit must be avoided at all costs, writes Matthew d\u2019Ancona. \u201cNow that we know the full detail of the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer assumptions about a no-deal Brexit, the term \u2018Project Fear\u2019 must be expunged from the respectable political lexicon. If you look to the heavens and see a UK-sized breeze block plummeting towards you, it is not \u2018alarmism\u2019, or \u2013 as Boris Johnson would put it \u2013 a failure of character and confidence, to try to avert its descent.\u201d Sport England got close but Australia held out, with the second Ashes Test at Lord\u2019s ending in a draw. Despite Jack Leach and Jofra Archer claiming three wickets apiece, England ultimately ran out of time. In a scenario that two days ago was unthinkable, it was Marnus Labuschagne who ultimately shepherded the Australians to safety, batting through 30 overs to allow Australia to head for Leeds with their 1-0 lead intact. Michael Cheika gave the Wallabies every chance to regain the Bledisloe Cup at Eden Park in Auckland on Saturday night, except \u2013 that is \u2013 a game plan for wet weather. While the coach stuck with the team that upset the All Blacks 47-26 in Perth the previous week, giving the players the opportunity to bring back the Bledisloe and end a 16-year drought, the squad was ill-suited to rainy Auckland. Thinking time: \u2018The word \u201cwife\u201d: it\u2019s a golden cage, swallow the key\u2019 Imagine the scene. You\u2019re a middle-aged woman, sitting around the table with your husband, your mother and your teenage daughter. Your husband is saying how hard he tried to give you the best 40th birthday party ever, and you didn\u2019t appreciate it. Then you announce that you never wanted to get married in the first place because marriage is a trap, but your mother forced you into it because you were pregnant. Grandma responds that this is news to her, but agrees that your wedding was horrible. Your daughter is just staring at all of you and saying wow a lot. Well, you don\u2019t actually have to imagine it, because this is a real conversation that Hollywood stars Jada Pinkett Smith and her husband Will Smith had at home in Calabasas, California, with their daughter, Willow and, Jada\u2019s mother, Adrienne. And they weren\u2019t alone: the conversation was recorded on camera as an episode of Jada\u2019s series, Red Table Talk, an online discussion show which has become the breakthrough unscripted hit in social-media television. Media roundup The Australian reports that the Coalition\u2019s commanding post-election opinion poll edge over Labor has slipped, with the latest Newspoll showing the government has a narrow 51-49 lead on two-party-preferred basis. The Age and Sydney Morning Herald report that China\u2019s ambassador to Australia has warned the Morrison government not to interfere in its affairs by supporting \u201cviolent radicals\u201d in Hong Kong. And the ABC reports that the AFP has confirmed it tipped off Cambodian police in a case that led to a Brisbane schoolteacher being sentenced to 23 years in prison. Coming up Josh Frydenberg will outline a road map for reforming the financial services sector by implementing the recommendations of the Hayne royal commission. Asic will hold a public hearing in the lead-up to updating its responsible lending guidance. Witnesses will include NAB and ANZ representatives.",

Amid confusion, the sale collapsed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat a joke,\u201d Johnny Shaughnessy, a collector from southern California, told Bloomberg. \u201cThey just lost so much credibility.

But the Type 64 is not technically a Porsche and it is made mostly from Volkswagen parts.</p> <p>War broke out before the Berlin-Rome race could be held, so Porsche, a member of the Nazi party and the SS who was later imprisoned, used the Type 64 as his daily driver. According to Sotheby\u2019s, he referred to the car as \u201cthe ancestor\u201d and later added his name to the grille.</p> <p>The car has been altered, including new brakes and rear lights and a new steering rack.

      "bodyText": "A car designed by Ferdinand Porsche in Nazi Germany that was expected to sell for millions failed to find a buyer at an auction in California on Saturday, amid scenes of confusion and derision. The strikingly unusual Porsche Type 64 was built in 1939, when Porsche was a designer for Volkswagen, as a commission from the National Socialist Motor Corps. It was meant to win a Berlin-to-Rome race planned to celebrate the \u201cPact of Steel\u201d between Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. At RM Sotheby\u2019s premier sale in Monterey on Saturday, the car was expected to fetch more than $20m (\u00a316.4m). According to Bloomberg News, the auctioneer started the bidding at $30m (\u00a324.7m) and as offers rapidly escalated to $70m (\u00a357.8m), some in the crowd laughed while others cheered. But then the auctioneer said he had meant to say $13m at the start, then $17m. Amid confusion, the sale collapsed. \u201cWhat a joke,\u201d Johnny Shaughnessy, a collector from southern California, told Bloomberg. \u201cThey just lost so much credibility. My father could have bought that car for $5m years ago. It has been passed around for years and no one wants it.\u201d An anonymous collector was quoted as saying the auction house \u201cjust slit their own throat\u201d. John Bothwell, director of Pur Sang Bugatti, was quoted as calling the sale \u201ca massive fuck up\u201d. Some present reportedly thought the mistake was a stunt. A Sotheby\u2019s spokeswoman told Bloomberg: \u201cDespite interest from discerning collectors, we were unable to reach common ground between seller and buyer on the night. \u201cAs bidding opened on the Type 64, increments were mistakenly overheard and displayed on the screen, causing unfortunate confusion in the room. The car reached a high bid of $17m.\u201d The super car market appears to be losing speed. Bloomberg reported that the Sotheby\u2019s sale ended down 25% on 2018, with average prices down $75,000. Ferdinand Porsche made the car himself, Sotheby\u2019s said, and it bears the kind of sleek lines that have made his designs so famous. But the Type 64 is not technically a Porsche and it is made mostly from Volkswagen parts. War broke out before the Berlin-Rome race could be held, so Porsche, a member of the Nazi party and the SS who was later imprisoned, used the Type 64 as his daily driver. According to Sotheby\u2019s, he referred to the car as \u201cthe ancestor\u201d and later added his name to the grille. The car has been altered, including new brakes and rear lights and a new steering rack. Originally black, it was painted turquoise and now silver. Alexander Weaver, a car specialist for Sotheby\u2019s told Bloomberg: \u201cIf Mr Porsche thought it was good enough to carry the Porsche badge, then yes, I\u2019d call it a Porsche.\u201d",

Stokes was keen to talk up Archer too, describing his teammate\u2019s ability as frightening before adding: \u201cI am not sure there will be a better debut in terms of announcing yourself. \u201cThe spell [to Smith on Saturday] was incredible to watch. We were laughing he was going to be top of the rankings after one Test. We are very lucky he is in our team. He gives you an extra dimension.\u201d Tim Paine, the Australia captain, said his side were not at their best in this Test and admitted Smith\u2019s chances of returning to the fold this week remain subject to medical clearance in the coming days. He said: \u201cIt was a really nasty knock. He felt OK then the concussion was delayed \u2013 he woke up not feeling well. I\u2019m no doctor but we have professionals who makes those decisions. Steve passed the tests [on the day] but deteriorated overnight. I\u2019m not sure about Headingley. He\u2019ll need to improve, there\u2019s no doubt about that. Hopefully for our sake he does.\u201d On Archer, Paine added: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen him for a few years now [in Twenty20 cricket] and we know the package he brings with his pace. That\u2019s something every team wants to have. It\u2019s up to us to make some plans and get better [against him]. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Cricket does not like substitutes. Ring-in fielders come and go all day but not without muttering about how they are deployed. The limited-overs Supersub remains a derided innovation. So many fabled incidents involve players coming out to do what their medical condition suggested they should not try and should not succeed at. Piles of anonymous matches have been all but decided by injury in a first hour or a vital later stage.</p> \n<p>So when Marnus Labuschagne became the first concussion substitute in Test cricket, for Steve Smith, it felt weird \u2013 like potting the eight-ball and having a pool hustler tell you to take the shot again. It was a relaxation of rules in a way that used not to be possible.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/18/england-australia-ashes-second-test-match-report\">England go close but Australia hold out to draw second Ashes Test</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If it felt weird to watch, imagine how it felt for Labuschagne, the smiley, affable adopted Queenslander who had played a couple of Tests before turning 25 two months ago. Australia had notionally named a squad of 12 for Lord\u2019s and he was not in it. He had been kicking back for four days as part of the back-up troop, running gloves and raiding the dessert trolley. Then, all of a sudden, on day five of a Test he was in.</p> \n<p>The concussion substitute is predicated on \u201clike for like\u201d replacements, as decided by the match referee. This concept is absurd when the sub is replacing the literal and statistical best since Bradman. When Smith was hurt in the first innings he had nearly brought up 26 centuries in 98 Test knocks, by far the closest to Bradman\u2019s 29 in 80.</p> \n<p>Imagine being pretty good at what you do, even very good. But you are on the young side, you are learning. Then someone calls out across the dressing room. Hey! You there! You\u2019re going to be the best player in the world for this afternoon. And you\u2019re going to face the one bowler who took him down.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/18/cricket-steve-smith-ruled-out-ashes-second-test-concussion-england-australia\">Steve Smith hopeful of playing in third Ashes Test despite concussion</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That was Jofra Archer, burning gas at more than 150km per hour, threatening the badge of the helmet and the edge of the bat in equal measure. On walking to the crease Labuschagne was a like-for-like replacement for Smith in that he was hit by Archer, second ball, picking up right where Smith had left off.</p> \n<p>Labuschagne did not have time to duck. He sensed it coming and was bending his knees but was only halfway through a flinch of the head when the ball smashed into his grille. It hit the bottom bar of the metal \u2013 had his head lifted slightly he would have been carried off with a broken jaw. Instead he bounced up like a cartoon from under an anvil.</p> \n<p>The situation was already tense. Australia were two wickets down with 42 overs left to survive for a draw. Archer had already removed the vastly experienced David Warner and Usman Khawaja, pitching up and moving the ball to force each to nick. A third wicket would prompt a tailspin.</p> \n<p>Through six of the next seven overs the batsman was pinned as if Archer was a lepidopterist. He was hit, he was hurried. A couple of times he was harried into an injudicious push but mostly his judgment was immaculate. As one bouncer seared at him he curved his spine to lean out of its way, watching it pass so closely by that it probably gave him a chest wax.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/18/steve-smiths-test-concussion-reignites-debate-about-safety\">Steve Smith\u2019s Test concussion reignites debate about safety</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet when the length was full, he pushed down the ground. When the line was wrong he flicked runs square. As Archer finally began to run short of air, the batsman drove on the up through cover for four. When he got an inside-edge plus overthrows, Labuschagne scored five off his box. When Archer was done, he was still there, 26 not out, the Smith that you have when you are not having a Smith.</p> \n<p>The toughness was as remarkable as the poise; old boots stitched together in a designer cut. England\u2019s main threat had been seen off and Australia were within 28 overs of safety. Only one more wicket had fallen.</p> \n<p>Labuschagne would collect 59 for himself, 12 overs from safety, before he was out with a sweep from Jack Leach deflecting off short-leg for an unlucky catch.</p> \n<p>A rcher returned to the crease the ball after Labuschagne departed, as if in tribute.

      "bodyText": "Cricket does not like substitutes. Ring-in fielders come and go all day but not without muttering about how they are deployed. The limited-overs Supersub remains a derided innovation. So many fabled incidents involve players coming out to do what their medical condition suggested they should not try and should not succeed at. Piles of anonymous matches have been all but decided by injury in a first hour or a vital later stage. So when Marnus Labuschagne became the first concussion substitute in Test cricket, for Steve Smith, it felt weird \u2013 like potting the eight-ball and having a pool hustler tell you to take the shot again. It was a relaxation of rules in a way that used not to be possible. If it felt weird to watch, imagine how it felt for Labuschagne, the smiley, affable adopted Queenslander who had played a couple of Tests before turning 25 two months ago. Australia had notionally named a squad of 12 for Lord\u2019s and he was not in it. He had been kicking back for four days as part of the back-up troop, running gloves and raiding the dessert trolley. Then, all of a sudden, on day five of a Test he was in. The concussion substitute is predicated on \u201clike for like\u201d replacements, as decided by the match referee. This concept is absurd when the sub is replacing the literal and statistical best since Bradman. When Smith was hurt in the first innings he had nearly brought up 26 centuries in 98 Test knocks, by far the closest to Bradman\u2019s 29 in 80. Imagine being pretty good at what you do, even very good. But you are on the young side, you are learning. Then someone calls out across the dressing room. Hey! You there! You\u2019re going to be the best player in the world for this afternoon. And you\u2019re going to face the one bowler who took him down. That was Jofra Archer, burning gas at more than 150km per hour, threatening the badge of the helmet and the edge of the bat in equal measure. On walking to the crease Labuschagne was a like-for-like replacement for Smith in that he was hit by Archer, second ball, picking up right where Smith had left off. Labuschagne did not have time to duck. He sensed it coming and was bending his knees but was only halfway through a flinch of the head when the ball smashed into his grille. It hit the bottom bar of the metal \u2013 had his head lifted slightly he would have been carried off with a broken jaw. Instead he bounced up like a cartoon from under an anvil. The situation was already tense. Australia were two wickets down with 42 overs left to survive for a draw. Archer had already removed the vastly experienced David Warner and Usman Khawaja, pitching up and moving the ball to force each to nick. A third wicket would prompt a tailspin. Through six of the next seven overs the batsman was pinned as if Archer was a lepidopterist. He was hit, he was hurried. A couple of times he was harried into an injudicious push but mostly his judgment was immaculate. As one bouncer seared at him he curved his spine to lean out of its way, watching it pass so closely by that it probably gave him a chest wax. Yet when the length was full, he pushed down the ground. When the line was wrong he flicked runs square. As Archer finally began to run short of air, the batsman drove on the up through cover for four. When he got an inside-edge plus overthrows, Labuschagne scored five off his box. When Archer was done, he was still there, 26 not out, the Smith that you have when you are not having a Smith. The toughness was as remarkable as the poise; old boots stitched together in a designer cut. England\u2019s main threat had been seen off and Australia were within 28 overs of safety. Only one more wicket had fallen. Labuschagne would collect 59 for himself, 12 overs from safety, before he was out with a sweep from Jack Leach deflecting off short-leg for an unlucky catch. A rcher returned to the crease the ball after Labuschagne departed, as if in tribute. No Steve Smith or Steve Smith substitute has failed to cross fifty in this year\u2019s Ashes. The drama was not quite over yet: Leach picked up Matthew Wade, then Archer combined with a freakish Joe Denly catch to get rid of Tim Paine. But even as England toiled away under the floodlights, crowding the bat with as many as eight catchers, desperately searching for more breakthroughs to level the series, there was always the sense that time was against them. They finished up within four wickets of a win but Labuschagne was the one who had made sure they could not get any closer. Asked to be Steve Smith for a day, he had done enough.",

It has been deliberately leaked by a former minister in an attempt to influence discussions with EU leaders.</p> <p>\u201cThose obstructing preparation are no longer in government, \u00a32bn of extra funding has already been made available and Whitehall has been stood up to actually do the work through the daily ministerial meetings. The entire posture of government has changed.\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street advisers are privately claiming that EU leaders will not offer any concessions towards a new deal unless they are sure that parliament is unable to block a no-deal Brexit. They are already setting the stage to blame former ministers working against no deal, such as Philip Hammond and Greg Clark, for any failure in EU negotiations.</p> <p>However, Conservative rebels and opposition MPs working to stop a no-deal Brexit say Johnson has deliberately set the bar too high in his demands for the EU to scrap the backstop \u2013 the insurance mechanism to stop a hard border in Ireland.</p> <p>At his meetings with Merkel and Macron, Johnson is expected to reiterate that he will only accept a new deal that abandons the backstop, over concerns that it could trap the UK indefinitely in a customs union.</p> <p>With the EU collectively refusing to budge on the issue, No 10 is only expecting minimal discussion of Brexit with Merkel and Macron \u2013 more a restatement of each side\u2019s existing positions.</p> <p>Instead, discussions are expected to revolve around the agenda for next week\u2019s G7 summit in Biarritz in France, on issues such as foreign policy and security issues, the global economy and trade, and the environment and biodiversity.</p> <p>With no new deal in sight, Whitehall departments are increasingly making no deal their central scenario. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is understood to have sent some of her civil servants to Singapore to study their border model, as she wants free movement to end on the dot of 31 October.</p> <p>May\u2019s administration had planned to introduce an immigration bill to delay the end of free movement until new systems were in place, but Patel believes that it can be stopped with secondary legislation and new arrangements put in place in time.</p> <p>EU citizens who are resident in the UK will be allowed to stay under the \u201csettled status\u201d scheme, but campaign groups are warning that some people may be left in a legal limbo, especially if they frequently travel between the UK and the EU.</p>",

Speaking to Sky News, Kwasi Kwarteng, an energy minister, dismissed it as something with \u201ca lot of scaremongering around and a lot of people are playing into Project Fear and all the rest of it\u201d. The government of Gibraltar also claimed that predictions of queues of up to four hours at the border with Spain were \u201cout of date\u201d and based on \u201cplanning for worst-case scenarios\u201d. A No 10 source was even more critical, claiming the leak came from one of Theresa May\u2019s former ministers in order to undermine Johnson\u2019s trip to see Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, on Wednesday and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, on Thursday. Despite the document, leaked to the Sunday Times, being dated to earlier this month when Johnson was already in post, the senior No 10 source said: \u201cThis document is from when ministers were blocking what needed to be done to get ready to leave and the funds were not available. It has been deliberately leaked by a former minister in an attempt to influence discussions with EU leaders. \u201cThose obstructing preparation are no longer in government, \u00a32bn of extra funding has already been made available and Whitehall has been stood up to actually do the work through the daily ministerial meetings. The entire posture of government has changed.\u201d Downing Street advisers are privately claiming that EU leaders will not offer any concessions towards a new deal unless they are sure that parliament is unable to block a no-deal Brexit. They are already setting the stage to blame former ministers working against no deal, such as Philip Hammond and Greg Clark, for any failure in EU negotiations. However, Conservative rebels and opposition MPs working to stop a no-deal Brexit say Johnson has deliberately set the bar too high in his demands for the EU to scrap the backstop \u2013 the insurance mechanism to stop a hard border in Ireland. At his meetings with Merkel and Macron, Johnson is expected to reiterate that he will only accept a new deal that abandons the backstop, over concerns that it could trap the UK indefinitely in a customs union. With the EU collectively refusing to budge on the issue, No 10 is only expecting minimal discussion of Brexit with Merkel and Macron \u2013 more a restatement of each side\u2019s existing positions. Instead, discussions are expected to revolve around the agenda for next week\u2019s G7 summit in Biarritz in France, on issues such as foreign policy and security issues, the global economy and trade, and the environment and biodiversity. With no new deal in sight, Whitehall departments are increasingly making no deal their central scenario. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is understood to have sent some of her civil servants to Singapore to study their border model, as she wants free movement to end on the dot of 31 October. May\u2019s administration had planned to introduce an immigration bill to delay the end of free movement until new systems were in place, but Patel believes that it can be stopped with secondary legislation and new arrangements put in place in time. EU citizens who are resident in the UK will be allowed to stay under the \u201csettled status\u201d scheme, but campaign groups are warning that some people may be left in a legal limbo, especially if they frequently travel between the UK and the EU.",

For sure, but then Australia missed a few chances too \u2013 if Roy thinks he had a bad game, he can console himself with a glance at David Warner. </p> \n  <p>The winner, of course, was not just the weather, but Test cricket. Let\u2019s have a round of applause \u2013 not boos \u2013 for Steve Smith, who played phenomenally well before he took those blows. And a pat on the back for the selectors on both sides \u2013 all the bowlers they brought in, Hazlewood and Archer and Leach, did well. And one of them stamped his presence on the world of cricket in a way no bowler had done on debut since Narendra Hirwani of India, decades ago. </p> \n  <p>So Australia hang on to their 1-0 lead as the Ashes head for Headingley in Leeds, where battle resumes on Thursday, and England will need the win that just eluded them here.

Another blow to the head could have been terminal and Langer should have had the courage to stop this potentially happening.\u201d</p> \n  <p>I have some sympathy for Langer\u2019s situation: they have a concussion protocol in place, Smith passed all the tests, and was insisting he wanted to bat. The weakness I think is with the protocols in the first place. How can it be medically reasonable to pass a player fit within half an hour of being hit, when so often the symptoms don\u2019t manifest until much later even if the damage is there?</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s not the coach\u2019s call, or even maybe the individual doctor\u2019s call.

Smith apparently woke this morning with a deterioration in his condition, which is entirely unsurprising. Hence the very strong argument that he should not have been allowed to bat on yesterday, when there was likely to be some delayed concussion. He\u2019s now been pulled from the match. That will also likely raise some criticism from England, given that yesterday the official line was that Smith\u2019s arm was worse than his head, whereas today his arm is apparently feeling better but his head has ruled him out of the match.</p> \n  <p>My read on the situation would be that there\u2019s no reason to doubt he has a concussion, and the sensible thing is to withdraw him. But it also indicates that he had one yesterday. Being hit around the base of the skull by a ball at 92 miles an hour would make that all but inevitable.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d5933e58f084f687f3589ff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-18T11:21:59.695Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>35th over: England 106-4 (Stokes 25, Buttler 11) </strong>Little question for Tim Paine. First full over of pace for the day. Your stud bowler in Cummins. Why have you got a deep point instead of a third slip? There\u2019s some logic in cutting off boundaries for aggressive batsmen, but Stokes hasn\u2019t been pounding the rope. Two slips and a gully, and Cummins draws a thick edge that splits them for four. Stokes decides that luck must be with him, and clouts the next ball over cover with a diagonal slap for another boundary. Fast runs could be a good idea: that will put the match beyond Australia much more surely than batting time. And on this final day there might be a ball with your name on it any minute.

Good luck with that. We might be here until 10pm. Lyon bowls the first full over from the Nursery End, and Buttler knocks away a single for the day\u2019s first run. Stokes leaves a wide ball, then defends a straight one. Lyon is around the wicket to the left-hander, hoping to spin one for an edge or straighten one for a leg-before. Stokes is reaching for another ball to block it, that\u2019s not a great sign for the batsman. He stabs a straighter ball off his pads for his first run of the day.

Let\u2019s do this once and do it properly. The Archer \u2018story\u2019 is a massive beat-up driven entirely (surprise surprise) by the Australian arm of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s sport empire. They will be delighted at all the clicks they\u2019re getting because of people engaging. And the fact we\u2019re even discussing it means they\u2019ve got what they want, which is disappointing.</p> \n  <p>The contention is that Archer is bad because he didn\u2019t rush up to Smith after hitting him, and also some time later he was speaking to Jos Buttler and briefly smiled. There\u2019s a split-second screenshot of the latter which is misleading. Things have been getting very ugly online, where a whole lot of people who are apparently very concerned about decency and decorum in cricket have expressed this by going to Archer\u2019s social media accounts to call him \u201ca f***ing dog c**t\u201d and other similar expressions of... economic anxiety, are we calling it?</p> \n  <p>The whole thing is invented and it\u2019s obscene. Several players rushed up to Smith as soon as he was hit. Archer was obviously a bit confused, he started walking back to his mark and then turned around. By this stage there was already a crowd around the batsman, who was moving.</p> \n  <p>When someone is badly hurt, aside from the first person checking that they\u2019re breathing and in a stable position, the best thing to do is stay out of the way so they can get medical assistance. When you\u2019re really in a bad way you need a doctor, not an enquiry after your health. <br></p> \n  <p>In any case, the idea that you should pile onto a player in his first Test because he didn\u2019t do exactly what you think he should have done, in the brief moments following a fast-moving and quite distressing episode, is completely unreasonable. Everyone out there is a human being. Let\u2019s not waste the day going back and forth over it.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d59297a8f0896be8f8fb3b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-18T10:44:19.620Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Ah, that\u2019s more like it.

      "bodyText": "Joe on Jofra ... Geoff on Marnus ... Here is Vic Marks on the draw at Lord\u2019s. It\u2019s all over bar the montage set to music. And that\u2019s the first time Joe Root has ever led England to a home draw. Could he have declared a bit earlier? Maybe. Could Roy have held that regulation chance at second slip when Head was on 22? For sure, but then Australia missed a few chances too \u2013 if Roy thinks he had a bad game, he can console himself with a glance at David Warner. The winner, of course, was not just the weather, but Test cricket. Let\u2019s have a round of applause \u2013 not boos \u2013 for Steve Smith, who played phenomenally well before he took those blows. And a pat on the back for the selectors on both sides \u2013 all the bowlers they brought in, Hazlewood and Archer and Leach, did well. And one of them stamped his presence on the world of cricket in a way no bowler had done on debut since Narendra Hirwani of India, decades ago. So Australia hang on to their 1-0 lead as the Ashes head for Headingley in Leeds, where battle resumes on Thursday, and England will need the win that just eluded them here. Thanks for your company and your emails. The umps have called it off, three balls early. Fair enough. A day that had anti-climax written all over it turned out to be enthralling. Well played Travis Head, and Marnus Labuschagne, and Jack Leach, and above all Jofra Archer. 47th over: Australia 154-6 (Head 42, Cummins 1) Head sees off Denly, turning down at least four runs in the process. Can\u2019t work out why he didn\u2019t take a single off the last ball. 46th over: Australia 154-6 (Head 42, Cummins 1) Leach had Cummins dropped earlier in the over, a tough low chance to Burns at silly point, which will at least make Roy feel a bit better. The win isn\u2019t quite going to happen, but it\u2019s still fun to watch. Cummins had shoved his pad well outside off. No shot played, to Leach... Looks tight. 45th over: Australia 154-6 (Head 42, Cummins 1) Denly manages a maiden, but there\u2019s no real threat, understandably. And here\u2019s Colum Fordham in Italy. \u201cTold my wife I\u2019d go down to a little bar in the sleepy town of Piobbico in Le Marche, to watch the last two hours of the Test. \u2018I\u2019ll be back in an hour if it seems to be getting boring.\u2019 Well, it\u2019s fascinating with Leach and Archer peppering the Aussies and I\u2019m still here lined up for a refreshing aperitivo to enjoy this amazing phenomenon that is Test cricket. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll understand.\u201d 44th over: Australia 154-6 (Head 42, Cummins 1) Cummins keeps Leach out. And the umpires decide that the light is too bad for Archer to bowl, so it\u2019s going to be ... Denly\u2019s part-time leg-breaks. 43rd over: Australia 154-6 (Head 42, Cummins 1) Archer hits Head on the hand, which is preferable to hitting anyone on the head. Root gives him seven close catchers \u2013 a silly point, two short legs and a leg gully as well as two slips and a conventional gully. If this is going to be a draw, it\u2019s a very gripping one. 42nd over: Australia 153-6 (Head 42, Cummins 0) Head cover-drives Leach for four. He\u2019s been quietly excellent, keeping his Head while all around etc. 41st over: Australia 149-6 (Head 38, Cummins 0) \u201cEngland,\u201d says Shane Warne, \u201care a chance. A good chance!\u201d Just when you think this game has nodded off, it jerks back into life. Archer\u2019s bouncer brings a hook from Paine which is caught by Denly, leaping to his left at square leg like a one-handed salmon. 40th over: Australia 144-5 (Head 37, Paine 4) Paine on-drives Leach for four, which sends him over the wicket and allows for some kicking away. Eight overs left, and Australia have almost escaped. 39th over: Australia 139-5 (Head 36, Paine 0) Root, who\u2019s looking more authoritative than he has for some time, keeps Archer on and gives him three short legs for Tim Paine \u2013 two in his hip pocket, one at leg slip. Paine insists on fending the short ball, which keeps all those men interested, but he survives. 38th over: Australia 138-5 (Head 35, Paine 0) So England\u2019s chance of a win on CricViz has rocketed from zero to 3%. I\u2019d put it a bit higher than that \u2013 say three times as high. There are ten overs left. Oooh.... Is that a door I hear, just creaking ajar? Leach lands one in the rough, which Wade can only prod to Buttler at short leg. And Leach is on a hat-trick. 37th over: Australia 137-4 (Head 35, Wade 0) Even a weary Archer can still rattle a helmet. This isn\u2019t one of his sickeners \u2013 Matthew Wade ducks and the ball just glances off his lid and goes for four leg byes. 36th over: Australia 132-4 (Head 34, Wade 0) So Leach picks up a third wicket, equalling Lyon\u2019s match haul, for far fewer runs. Yet another sweep, a ricochet off the man at short leg, and Root seems to have held on to an excellent low catch at square leg. After many replays, it\u2019s determined that he has. Labuschagne goes off shaking his head, just as Smith would. What an understudy he has turned out to be. 35th over: Australia 124-3 (Labuschagne 51, Head 34) Joe Root takes himself straight off again, not unreasonably, and turns back to his favourite bowler, Jofra Archer. The force isn\u2019t with him, the speed is a Broad-like mid-80s, but the accuracy is still there. He\u2019s now got through 40 overs in the match and taken four for 86. In the course of his debut, he has turned into a senior player. 34th over: Australia 123-3 (Labuschagne 50, Head 34) Marnus Labuschagne sweeps Leach for four, pushes him for a single and reaches a fine fearless fifty off 89 balls \u2013 the greatest innings ever played by a concussion sub. Like for like, you say... And here\u2019s an unexpected email from Alexander Hayes. \u201cPlease can you tell my younger brother Oliver Hayes [24th over] that if he wants to humblebrag about his rural French idyll on OBO, he should more correctly use \u2018younger\u2019 to refer to his poo-archering son, as to my knowledge (though this would be an interesting public forum on which to enlighten the family) he has only the two offspring.\u201d Oof. 33rd over: Australia 118-3 (Labuschagne 45, Head 34) This is the first over of the last 15, though there may be handshakes before that. Root brings himself on, dishes up two balls of filth (both cut away with ease), and then settles with four dots. That\u2019s drinks, with the game finally drifting towards the draw that Jofra Archer did all he could to prevent. 32nd over: Australia 111-3 (Labuschagne 41, Head 30) Another maiden, this time from Leach \u2013 the run was a leg-bye, cricket\u2019s perennial waste of space. \u201cDo not have electricity at my home in India now,\u201d says Vivek Begwani, \u201cand my mobile phone has just 5% charge left. Not sure will be able to sustain till the end of the Test match, just keep the Aussie boys going for me Tim, would hate to see them lose from here by the time I get an update. Already feeling the sense of helplessness of not being able to follow such a crucial end of one of the riveting Test matches.\u201d Riveting is the word. And I\u2019m feeling your pain with the 5%. 31st over: Australia 110-3 (Labuschagne 41, Head 30) Stokes bowls a maiden to Head, which is a minor triumph after he conceded 16 off his first two overs. \u201cDearest Tim,\u201d begins Mac Millings. \u201cDarren Thompson (25th over) can rest assured that Gary Naylor is purely a figment of the fevered OBO Collective Imagination. And I should know \u2013 I\u2019ve met him.\u201d 30th over: Australia 110-3 (Labuschagne 41, Head 30) Facing Leach, Labuschagne produces a tuck for two and a sweep for four, then plays and misses at a snorter out of the rough, and misses two more sweeps, one of which brings a noisy appeal for LBW. He seems to have mislaid that calm temperament he showed against the new ball. 29th over: Australia 104-3 (Labuschagne 35, Head 30) Head rubs it in with a couple of fours, through the covers, one of them via an uncharacteristic misfield from Denly. The sun is back out now, and England\u2019s hopes are virtually extinguished. Stokes persuades Head to fend away from his body, the chance is a straightforward one, but Roy fumbles it at second slip. He\u2019s had a nightmare here. 28th over: Australia 96-3 (Labuschagne 35, Head 22) Leach returns with four men round the bat, and again there\u2019s an ooh and an aaah as one keeps low. In the second innings, Leach has outbowled Lyon, who took none for 102 earlier. 27th over: Australia 96-3 (Labuschagne 35, Head 22) Stokes comes on, half an hour after the OBO demanded it. Head greets him with a back-foot force for four and then repeats the shot, with less conviction but the same result. In between, Stokes almost nabs him with a yorker, only to realise that it\u2019s angled in too sharply. 26th over: Australia 88-3 (Labuschagne 35, Head 14) Labuschagne spots a wide one and cuts for four. After all those quips about the impossibility of finding a like-for-like replacement for Smith, they seem to have found one. He was struck outside the line, and was playing a shot, so we never get to ball-tracking, but Woakes is getting warmer here. Woakes thinks he\u2019s goddim... 25th over: Australia 84-3 (Labuschagne 31, Head 14) Head glances Broad for four. \u201cWho is this Gary Naylor bloke?\u201d wonders Darren Thompson on Twitter. \u201cHe seems to get a mention every day on OBO for years. Is he a sage, is he a mate, or is he a Gary? A Gary that asks/comments the most pertinent questions and I am not jealous of. Not at all.\u201d 24th over: Australia 80-3 (Labuschagne 31, Head 10) The lights are on to counter the encircling gloom, which prompts Root to take Leach off and turn to Woakes. He makes both batsmen play but doesn\u2019t get past the edge. \u201cThe runs\u201d is the subject line from Oliver Hayes. \u201cMy youngest has just archered the contents of his bowels up his back (and my front), his brother simultaneously crashed a jam jar to the tiled floor, and the rather over-sensitive washing machine is leaking spectacularly in the face of heavy spin (sorry). All this is fading wonderfully into irrelevance as I grin from ear to ear listening to long-wave coverage of the cricket from rural France.\u201d \u201cNever mind archered,\u201d says Amelia Vine, \u201cyou could just be leached instead?\u201d 23rd over: Australia 77-3 (Labuschagne 30, Head 8) Archer gets his breather at last as Broad returns. Labuschagne sizes him up with a leave or two and then pulls out a classy cover drive. \u201cAfternoon Tim,\u201d says George Browne. \u201cIs there anything better in all of cricket than absolute fire at one end and a confident spinner at the other?\u201d Well, yes \u2013 a tied World Cup final, followed by a tied Super Over. But I take your point. 22nd over: Australia 73-3 (Labuschagne 26, Head 8) Head has the guts to drive Leach out of the rough and gets his reward with four through the covers. He celebrates by keeping out a grubber of the kind that did for Bancroft. It may be lucky this pitch didn\u2019t have five days\u2019 full wear and tear: it would be a minefield. \u201cI know we talk about 2005 a lot,\u201d says Guy Hornsby, \u201cbut I\u2019ve not felt as excited about a Test debut since KP came on the scene. And like that incredible Test, Archer has taken it by the scruff of the neck. We may not win this, but there\u2019s a real frisson for his potential career.\u201d 21st over: Australia 69-3 (Labuschagne 26, Head 4) Root, who just loves his new toy, keeps Archer on. First ball, Labuschagne has a waft at a short one outside off. Second ball, delivered from round the wicket, he manages a canny shove for a single towards midwicket. Third ball, 90mph and full, Head tucks off his pads for four. Last ball, up at 92, there\u2019s an appeal for LBW, but again it\u2019s too legsideish. Archer needs a breather, if only to digest his tea. An update on the Thonger Dilemma (2nd over and 16:59). \u201cPlease tell Tom Atkins,\u201d says Kim Thonger, \u201cI\u2019ve compromised by watching Tarantino with the TMS channel streaming discreetly into my hearing aid. Should be an interesting audiovisual experience.\u201d 20th over: Australia 63-3 (Labuschagne 25, Head 0) Labuschagne keeps out Leach, who\u2019s been quietly excellent in this match, giving Root the control that Moeen couldn\u2019t. England\u2019s chance of a win on CricViz has slid back down to 7%, which is seven more than Australia\u2019s. 19th over: Australia 62-3 (Labuschagne 24, Head 0) Root is in danger of overbowling Archer again \u2013 this is his ninth over and his pace is down to 86 or so. Get Stokes on! 18th over: Australia 59-3 (Labuschagne 21, Head 0) Labuschagne lives dangerously against Leach, sweeping when there\u2019s a man on the 45 waiting for the top edge, but he gets away with it and works a single to midwicket. Australia need another 208 off 30 overs. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going for them,\u201d says Warne. 17th over: Australia 58-3 (Labuschagne 20, Head 0) Archer gets one past the outside edge, but Labuschagne responds with a couple of good leaves. \u201cLooks really well organised,\u201d says David Lloyd, who once spent a winter dodging thunderbolts from Lillee and Thomson, on far quicker pitches than this. 16th over: Australia 53-3 (Labuschagne 20, Head 0) Travis Head decides to treat Leach to the sweep, and misses. Chastened, he tries a prod, and thick-edges just short of Joe Root at short square leg. Then he shapes to sweep again, pulls out at the last moment, and is nearly bowled, before jabbing down on one that keeps low. \u201cHe\u2019s all over the place,\u201d says Shane Warne. \u201cWonderful over from Leach.\u201d 15th over: Australia 49-3 (Labuschagne 20, Head 0) Archer continues from the Pavilion end but is only bowling 87-88mph. He must have had one celebratory cupcake too many. \u201cMr Labuschagne,\u201d says Jason Ali, \u201chas a rather grand name. Moreover, you can have a bit of fun making anagrams from it. One of my favourites is Agnus Bleach. It\u2019s the sort of moniker a character from The League of Gentlemen might have.\u201d 14th over: Australia 47-3 (Labuschagne 18, Head 0) Leach continues and Labuschagne, after kicking him away, works a single into the leg side. He\u2019s shown great temperament. But then comes Bancroft\u2019s downfall, and England\u2019s chance of a win on CricViz jumps from 7% to 15. A grubber! And Bancroft goes back, fatally. That was about as plumb as plumb can be. \u201cTell Kim Thonger to stay with the cricket,\u201d says Tom Atkins, referring to a dilemma from the 2nd over. \u201cTarantino films are like the West Indies \u2013 magnificent back in the day but nowadays patchy with the odd reminder of their former brilliance becoming increasingly rare. The Bluray will be out later in the year when the evenings get too cold and dark for cricket.\u201d \u201cHow long,\u201d wonders Gary Naylor, \u201cbefore \u2018to archer\u2019 becomes a thing? \u2018I thought Anthony Joshua was finished, but he absolutely archered Andy Ruiz in the rematch.\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t really want to go archering blokes in Bristol.\u2019 \u2018Root was archered in The Walkabout but he\u2019s getting his revenge now.\u2019\u201d \u201cPerspective,\u201d says the subject line of an email from Matt Dony. \u201cYeah,\u201d it goes on, \u201cbut he\u2019s no Alan Igglesden, is he?\u201d 13th over: Australia 46-2 (Bancroft 16, Labuschagne 17) Poor old Labuschagne, facing Archer again, is rapped on the glove. Undaunted, he gets three for a push past gully, Bancroft then pops one into the leg trap, but it\u2019s off the thigh pad. And finally Archer bowls that brutal bouncer of his, and Bancroft jags his head out of the way, exemplarily. And that is tea, with Australia needing another 221 off 35 overs. \u201cSerious Test cricket,\u201d says Nasser. He can say that again. See you shortly. 12th over: Australia 43-2 (Bancroft 16, Labuschagne 14) Now Jack Leach comes on, and after being innocuous from round the wicket, he goes over and instantly gets one to spit past Labuschagne\u2019s outside edge. This game isn\u2019t going to sleep yet. 11th over: Australia 42-2 (Bancroft 16, Labuschagne 13) Yes, Archer is changing ends, and his first ball eases quite effortlessly past Bancroft\u2019s outside edge. A couple of balls later, Bancroft takes one \u2013 for the team \u2013 in the midriff. It\u2019s almost time for tea, which could be the most welcome break of these two young batsmen\u2019s lives. \u201cOnce Jofra Archer becomes accustomed to the subtleties of the longer form of red-ball cricket,\u201d says Paul Griffin, \u201cI think he could be rather effective.\u201d 10th over: Australia 42-2 (Bancroft 16, Labuschagne 13) Leach was a decoy: it\u2019s Chris Woakes replacing Archer, or perhaps enabling him to change ends. Labuschagne sizes him up and then on-drives, handsomely, for four. \u201cJofra Archer,\u201d says the editor of Cricinfo, Sambit Bal, on Twitter, \u201cis a once-in-a-lifetime bowler. He is not only going to take lots of wickets, he is also going shatter the confidence of a few batsmen.\u201d 9th over: Australia 38-2 (Bancroft 16, Labuschagne 9) Bancroft again flirts with Broad\u2019s leg trap. He\u2019s been positive but far from convincing. And now Jack Leach is loosening up. 8th over: Australia 36-2 (Bancroft 14, Labuschagne 9) Whatever you think about people batting on after being hit on the head, Labuschagne, like Smith yesterday, is showing that he is not short of ticker. He cover-drives Archer for four, then plays and misses, but keeps his cool to squirt another four wide of the slips. Joe Root seems to be whipping up the crowd to make more noise, which brings a tut from Nasser Hussain, who wants to see more than two slips. \u201cThe crowd can\u2019t set the field for you.\u201d 7th over: Australia 28-2 (Bancroft 14, Labuschagne 1) Broad is almost a bit-part player but he very nearly nabs Bancroft, flicking loosely and just evading the diving Stokes at a deepish leg slip. An email from Rob Smyth, of all people. \u201cCan you have a concussion sub for the concussion sub? (Serious question)\u201d I guess so... 6th over: Australia 20-2 (Bancroft 7, Labuschagne 0) Archer follows up that blow, understandably, by bowling line and length to Labuschagne, who misses the first ball and leaves the next. What a bowler Archer is, though. He now has two for five in this innings, and he has made the most dramatic Test debut at Lord\u2019s since Bob Massie in 1972. Not again... Archer\u2019s bouncer thuds into Labuschagne\u2019s grille, and makes that sickening noise that rang around the ground yesterday. He gets straight back to his feet, thankfully, but is being checked by the team doctor. Another one for Archer! A classic nick behind. Australia\u2019s top order has been awful in this series, even worse than England\u2019s. And they don\u2019t have their Bailout Man today, alas. Here comes the first concussion sub in Test history, Marnus Labuschagne. 5th over: Australia 21-1 (Bancroft 7, Khawaja 0) Bancroft is a reassuring figure for fans of the opposing side. He gets a wide one from Broad and wafts at thin air, but recovers well to clip for four and reduce the target to 250. \u201cHey Timmy,\u201d says Sarah Helsham, in an email from a few minutes ago. \u201cLast we spoke, we were in Hoi an Vietnam reading the stream of game 1. Me and Shaun (English man and Aussie girl) couldn\u2019t watch, so thanks for the Guardian. We are back home in Sydney now and thankful for our TV \u2013 can the Aussies pull off another win? With my hero Steve out, I am not so sure, and of course it all depends on when England declare - shauno thinks, against his better judgement, that a declaration will never happen. But they just did after smashing us about a bit.... Can Warner pull put some 20/20 form and bring us a victory? Doubt it.\u201d Well, you got that right. \u201cKeep up the good work mate.\u201d 4th over: Australia 13-1 (Bancroft 3, Khawaja 0) Fortified by his third Test wicket, Archer puts his foot on the pedal and greets Khawaja with a 92mph snorter. He follows up with a yorker, which Khawaja clips neatly but not past the man at square leg. Archer bowled far better than his figures in the first innings, so he was owed that wicket. Warner flops again! He was looking purposeful but the first ball he faces from Archer undoes him \u2013 it\u2019s on off, straightening a touch, he pokes forward, and Rory Burns takes a sharp low catch at third slip. Game very much on. 3rd over: Australia 12-0 (Bancroft 2, Warner 5) Four leg byes as Warner misses a tickle off Broad. He then misses an upper cut, before each batsman takes a quick single. CricViz, which was giving Australia 0% chance of a win a few minutes ago, has raised them to 1%, with England lording it on 7%. 2nd over: Australia 6-0 (Bancroft 1, Warner 4) Heeere\u2019s Jofra, snaking in from the Nursery end, from where he bowled that Super Over, five long weeks ago today. He\u2019s a little stiff, only manages 85-87mph, but his line is so good that there\u2019s no run from Bancroft\u2019s bat, just a no-ball. \u201cAfternoon Tim.\u201d Good to hear from you, Kim Thonger. \u201cWe are very worried, for two reasons. We have tickets for Tarantino\u2019s latest movie, at 17:20 today. 1. How on Earth do we choose between the twin joys of his plot twists, and a final session climactic showdown at Lords? Coin toss? 2. Our daughter can be squeamish. She can just about cope with Tarantino gore-fests but if we choose the cricket should we make her look away?\u201d 1st over: Australia 5-0 (Bancroft 1, Warner 4) Broad starts with a dud, trying to york Bancroft and succeeding only in giving him a gimme outside leg. He produces a better ball for Warner, but a bit wide of off, and Warner punches it for four as if he hadn\u2019t been Broad\u2019s bunny this series. Next ball is a beauty, straightening, beating Warner\u2019s prod, going over middle, and turning Broad\u2019s face into that emoji of astonishment that we know so well. Later in the over, there\u2019s an inside edge. Game definitely on for now. Are you ready for episode two of The Archer? So am I, but first it\u2019s going to be Stuart Broad, from the pavilion end, which is where Archer was so formidable yesterday. \u201cAgreed,\u201d says John Starbuck, picking up on 15:23. \u201cStokes is now mainly a batsman who bowls a bit. This means that they could draft in Sam Curran for Denly or Roy and go with four fast men and a spinner. I\u2019d send Bairstow in to open and give the gloves to Foakes, too.\u201d I\u2019d love to see them find a way of fitting Curran in, but I\u2019m not sure that will be it. So Australia need 267 to win off a theoretical 50 overs, more likely around 47. That\u2019s a good decision by Joe Root, giving his bowlers a slim chance of taking ten wickets \u2013 in the first innings of this series, at Edgbaston, Australia were eight down in the 44th over, and that was with Steve Smith immovable at one end. Game on, if only for a bit. And that\u2019s that, after one last over from Siddle that turns into party time. Stokes sees a full toss and straight-thumps it for four, then swings a six into the stand. 70th over: England 242-5 (Stokes 100, Bairstow 29) Bairstow celebrates Stokes\u2019s ton with a six. The mood has turned, rather more sharply than anything from Lyon. A nudge round the corner off Lyon, and he\u2019s there. That is a very fine hundred, partly because it was far from flawless \u2013 dicey at first, then dogged, and finally domineering. His first fifty took 106 balls, the second only 54. It\u2019s almost official: Stokes is now a batsman who bowls. 69th over: England 235-5 (Stokes 99, Bairstow 23) Stokes takes a quick single off Siddle, hoping for two, but it\u2019s not there. Bairstow then does likewise and manages it, which stops Stokes getting the strike. One more over, if that Thorpe signal is to be believed. England lead by 243. 68th over: England 232-5 (Stokes 98, Bairstow 21) Graham Thorpe, England\u2019s batting coach, points three fingers at Stokes from the balcony, suggesting that he has three overs to get his hundred before the declaration. It shouldn\u2019t take that many \u2013 he\u2019s seeing it so big now, he shovels-pulls Hazlewood neatly into the gap between deep square and long leg. 67th over: England 224-5 (Stokes 91, Bairstow 20) Siddle manages a few dots, so Bairstow improvises and dinks a four through the deserted slips. It\u2019s not often that England accelerate when Jos Buttler gets out but that\u2019s exactly what has happened here. These two have added 63 in ten overs, and the crowd are loving it. Afternoon everyone and thanks Geoff. Remaining japery! Makes a change from all the leaving japery Britain is having to stomach at the moment. 66th over: England 215-5 (Stokes 87, Bairstow 15) Lyon is off, spin hasn\u2019t worked. Hazlewood comes from the Nursery End, pace both ends. Stokes charges him, slogs across the line, and misses utterly. Maybe there was a message from Root. Get your ton fast, we\u2019re having a Guy Rundle. Stokes then tries a pull shot and misses. Then another big wallop, and not only misses but gets rammed straight in the bowl of Jatz Crackers. Sits down for a minute to compose himself. Doesn\u2019t compose himself. Charges again, has another big smear, and gets a bottom edge past leg stump for two. Tries a glide to farm strike and hits point instead. Then finally connects with the sixth ball and crunches a cut for four! That\u2019s my lot for Lord\u2019s. See you at Headingley. To guide you through the remaining japery from here, it\u2019ll be Tim de Lisle. 65th over: England 209-5 (Stokes 85, Bairstow 15) I think you can say that England are safe now, with the lead over 200. Stokes charges Siddle, starting a new spell, and spanks him through cover for four! Then nails another drive but only for one this time. Bairstow clips a couple. Australia could still lose it from here but it would take a huge collapse. They\u2019d have to bowl England out actually, because I doubt England will declare. Unless this hitting is a prelude to declaring. Safest option is to bowl maidens but not take wickets now? 64th over: England 201-5 (Stokes 80, Bairstow 12) Stokes. Lyon. Edge. You know the drill. Yet again, Stokes plays a false shot but gets away with it. Enough of this nudging about, he says. With two balls left in the over, he clatters them both into the Tavern Stand for six. Slog-sweeps, one after the other. A man out there on the rope but not required. Sorry, Richard. 63rd over: England 187-5 (Stokes 66, Bairstow 12) YJB nearly goes the same way as Buttler, top-edging the Cummins short ball. This time it lands safely out at midwicket for a run. \u201cWhy was Buttler hooking in this situation?\u201d asks Richard Mansell. \u201cTime and wickets are more important than runs, and it\u2019s straight after lunch. It\u2019s an unnecessarily high-risk shot in the circumstances. He didn\u2019t need to play that ball. Didn\u2019t S Waugh stop hooking because he realised the risk wasn\u2019t worth it?\u201d Not sure I agree. If you survive a ball, that takes time out of the game. If you score runs from it, you double that time. Because then Australia have to score the runs back. Some discretion is still required, but strokeplay is an asset in this situation. 62nd over: England 185-5 (Stokes 65, Bairstow 11) Still no wickets for Lyon. He\u2019s had his near chances, but hasn\u2019t broken through. It\u2019s not a true fifth day, given we\u2019ve only had two days of wear on the pitch, but he would have expected more of himself. Two singles from the over. 61st over: England 183-5 (Stokes 64, Bairstow 10) Stokes is collecting runs pretty comfortably now, driving Cummins out through the covers for a couple. Has a big wallop at a wide ball before more successfully pushing one away for a single. 60th over: England 180-5 (Stokes 61, Bairstow 10) Heeeeeere\u2019s Jonny! Third ball of the over, he skips down and deposits Lyon over long on for six! Over the rope at the Nursery End. Then plays a reverse-sweep for one. Not sure what the public response would have been had either of those shots cost England\u2019s sixth wicket, at 178 in front. Lyon isn\u2019t perturbed, drawing Stokes\u2019 edge the very next ball, but again it flies safe. Has he had three or four of those from Lyon? Three runs, then a huge appeal as Bairstow misses a sweep down leg. Paine was sure there was glove on it. Just as well he\u2019s out of reviews, otherwise he would soon have been out of reviews. No contact. 59th over: England 168-5 (Stokes 57, Bairstow 2) Cummins to Bairstow, who manages to get a glance fine for a run. Cummins is just trying discipline to these players, not looking to snort them out. Given his recent success with snorting, one wonders whether it might not be a good move. These two are pretty solid against the short ball. It did work against Buttler though. A couple of runs for Stokes through deep third. \u201cWhy does a withdrawal due to concussion warrant a like for like replacement , but other injuries do not? I wonder if we will see a wholesale change in this area before too long?\u201d writes Simon Weekley. We might, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be discussed. The main difference is to discourage players pushing on through injury. Someone playing through concussion is in the worst case risking their life, where someone playing through a tight calf is not. 58th over: England 165-5 (Stokes 55, Bairstow 1) Young Jonny Bairstow is the new man in, down the non-striker\u2019s as Stokes faces up to Lyon. They trade a couple of singles, then Australia go up for DRS again when Lyon hits Stokes on the pad. That one looked with the naked eye like it was missing leg stump, and DRS thinks the same. It was straightening but not that much. There was a long delay while DRS froze and wouldn\u2019t show the prediction, but eventually it came up: red, red, green. Both reviews gone for Australia. England lead by 173. Pop them in? 57th over: England 161-5 (Stokes 54) Thick inside edge from Cummins for Stokes, two runs through square leg. Then a single to point, before Buttler\u2019s fateful hook to end the over. \u201cSky Sports has switched from the cricket to Crystal Palace v Sheffield United. Main event my arse,\u201d writes Ian Sargeant. They might want to switch back. There it is at last! Match back alive? Maybe so. Cummins bowls a well-directed short ball at Buttler\u2019s left shoulder. The batsman takes it on, but his thick top edge swirls down near the fine leg rope where Hazlewood stands firm. Five down! 56th over: England 158-4 (Stokes 51, Buttler 31) Another miss against Lyon! This time the ball beats the edge, hits the keeper, and loops over second slip for an extra. The Stokes show rolls on. 55th over: England 157-4 (Stokes 51, Buttler 31) The sandwiches have been cleared away and the players are wandering out onto the field. Australia will need to get a rattle on if they want any chance of a win in this match. The draw will firm as each over goes by. Cummins hangs the ball outside off stump for the entire first over, and Buttler will not be drawn. No wicket lost in the session, which is huge for England. Their dream realised. 21 full overs have been wiped off the total, so in theory we have 67 left to bowl at minimum. The chance of a result recedes. Stokes and Buttler, the Lord\u2019s favourites, are doing a job again. 54th over: England 157-4 (Stokes 51, Buttler 31) Two singles from Lyon\u2019s over, with Stokes getting his via another edge past slip. But he make it to lunch unscathed! 53rd over: England 155-4 (Stokes 50, Buttler 30) A maiden for Siddle, strictly speaking, though the last ball flies to the boundary from Buttler\u2019s pad as he advances at the bowler. Andy Hill writes in. \u201cAm I alone in finding the jingoistic triumphalism over a cricketer knocked senseless (and potentially killed) by a ball deliberately aimed at his body repugnant? What would the pundits be saying if it was Jofra who was felled, or Leach? I thought cricket as a blood sport ended with Hughes\u2019 death. Enough of this \u2018it\u2019s all in the game\u2019 crap. Because it isn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be cricket. Getting Test cricket to be vastly popular doesn\u2019t require the threat of death or lifelong injury.\u201d Well... it\u2019s not jingoistic, for one. Plenty of Australians like myself were enthralled by a wonderful contest. Just as people were when Mitchell Johnson did it in 2013-14, or Flintoff and Harmison before that, or Brett Lee before that, or the great West Indies attacks, or Lillee and Thompson, or John Snow, or Wes Hall, or Typhoon Tyson. They all bowled fast and they all bowled short, and it genuinely is part of the game, since bowling moved from lobs to overarm. No one is thrilled by injury. They are thrilled by the contest. It may be uncomfortable but that doesn\u2019t make it untrue. 52nd over: England 151-4 (Stokes 50, Buttler 30) Dragged short from Lyon, and Stokes cuts a single for his 50th run. He\u2019s got a thing for Ashes contests. I remember that century from 2013 well, on a cracking pitch in Perth when the rest of his team were a rabble. Stokes has raised his game here to help England out of a really difficult spot. Buttler raises the team 150 by slamming a drive through cover for four. 51st over: England 145-4 (Stokes 49, Buttler 25) Siddle again, drawing false shots as he does. A thick edge from Stokes for two, a skewed shot in the air towards point for one. Siddle just keeps beaming. An unexpected Ashes adventure. Loving life. 50th over: England 142-4 (Stokes 46, Buttler 25) Lyon to Buttler, who pads the ball just wide of the short leg! Gets an extra through square. Paine has two slips and a short leg for the left-handed Stokes, I like that. Lyon zips a straighter ball past the outside edge. Hands on heads. A push into the ground to slip. Then a nudged run. \u201cIs Marnus allowed to bowl optimistic leg spin on the grounds that Smith does?\u201d asks Charlie Tinsley. \u201cWhat would stop Australia picking another pace bowler for instance?\u201d Marnus can bowl, like anyone in the XI can bowl. It\u2019s just up to the match referee whether a player constitutes a like for like replacement. Marnus is a batsman primarily, so that\u2019s alright. 49th over: England 140-4 (Stokes 45, Buttler 25) Siddle will replace Hazlewood, Australia rotating all three quicks from the Pavilion End while Lyon camps out at the Nursery. A good early over too! Pace, plenty of movement down the slope too, and Stokes doesn\u2019t look very much in control for much of it, fishing about on his off stump. Here\u2019s our initial report on Smith, with some comment from Archer. 48th over: England 140-4 (Stokes 45, Buttler 25) Stokes goes back to looking ropey against spin, edging into his pads a couple of times as Lyon works away, trying to draw that one final error. Last ball of the over, Stokes is able to slide it off leg stump fine, and some hard running earns him three. 47th over: England 137-4 (Stokes 42, Buttler 25) Stokes looks more comfortable against the pace bowling, certainly. A lovely straight drive from Hazlewood, back past the far stumps for four! Once Buttler is done crawling on the ground to make sure he wasn\u2019t run out, I\u2019m sure he appreciated the shot. Buttler looks less comfortable, so once he gets strike he gives up a thick edge to Hazlewood, but it scoots along past gully for another lucky four. 46th over: England 128-4 (Stokes 37, Buttler 21) That\u2019s a bit more like it from Buttler. Unfurls a cover drive against Lyon for four, seeing the width and the fuller length. 45th over: England 123-4 (Stokes 36, Buttler 17) Stokes takes on the bouncer from Hazlewood and pulls it well, but to the man in the deep. That raises a fifty partnership, invaluable in this match. With each over it looks more like England can save it. Though there are still a lot of overs, theoretically, left in the day. Buttler works another couple of runs off his pads. This pair should have great memories of this ground at the World Cup final, perhaps they can do something special for England today too. 44th over: England 120-4 (Stokes 35, Buttler 15) Lyon is whirring away into his 15th over. No wickets as yet. Australia need him to bag a few to be in with a chance to win this Test. Buttler scores a brace pushed towards point. The lead is 128. 43rd over: England 118-4 (Stokes 35, Buttler 13) England certainly aren\u2019t racing after runs, so scotch that thought. Buttler does take a single in the over, off the pads from Hazlewood, who is cranking his pace up bit by bit into the 140s. Tim Doyle on email is pulling no punches. \u201cEminently understandable that a competitive sportsman like Smith would want to get back out and score a century. But Langer\u2019s leadership was nauseatingly weak - don\u2019t raise Phil Hughes on the one hand and call your players \u2018your sons\u2019, whilst on the other hand allowing a player to go back out and risk his life in pursuit of getting onto the honours board. Another blow to the head could have been terminal and Langer should have had the courage to stop this potentially happening.\u201d I have some sympathy for Langer\u2019s situation: they have a concussion protocol in place, Smith passed all the tests, and was insisting he wanted to bat. The weakness I think is with the protocols in the first place. How can it be medically reasonable to pass a player fit within half an hour of being hit, when so often the symptoms don\u2019t manifest until much later even if the damage is there? That\u2019s not the coach\u2019s call, or even maybe the individual doctor\u2019s call. It would fall to the administration to have stricter procedures in place. 42nd over: England 117-4 (Stokes 35, Buttler 12) Oh! Lyon is going to get Stokes eventually, surely he is. Another big edge from the off-spinner, reaching for a ball outside off. Warner at slip puts in a big dive but it\u2019s wide of him. Stokes profits by four runs. 41st over: England 113-4 (Stokes 31, Buttler 12) Another big appeal, this time with Hazlewood having replaced Cummins, down the hill against the left-handed Stokes. It\u2019s pitching outside leg and he nicked it. Aside from that the shout was good. Cummins talks Paine into a DRS appeal, which bears predictably little fruit. Stokes digs out a yorker for a single once his continued presence is confirmed. The only score from the over. 40th over: England 112-4 (Stokes 30, Buttler 12) Stokes cuts a short ball from Lyon for a single, then Buttler blots out the rest. Happy to play the long game today. \u201cGeoff, are we to assume that under the new regs about a like-for-like replacement, a team has already been dispatched to Adelaide\u2019s Centennial Park Cemetery to ask Don Bradman to get his pads on?\u201d writes Mark Lloyd. You\u2019ll have to ask Shaun Micallef, he\u2019s the expert at raising the Don. 39th over: England 111-4 (Stokes 29, Buttler 12) Cummins to Buttler, and it\u2019s another maiden. This time Cummins is very exercised when he hits the batsman on the pad, but he\u2019s bowling with slope going downhill for the right-hander, and that ball is missing leg. 38th over: England 111-4 (Stokes 29, Buttler 12) Stokes knows that Lyon is the big danger for him, so he\u2019s playing positively. A good stride for an on-drive, and Hazlewood makes a hash of the sliding save at long-on and takes it over the line. England raise Nelson: feet up. 37th over: England 107-4 (Stokes 25, Buttler 12) Cummins bowls a maiden to Buttler, who is keen to get moving but can\u2019t make it work. Three times he drives crisply; three times cover stops any run. Make them play. 36th over: England 107-4 (Stokes 25, Buttler 12) While I was typing that, Lyon bowled an over for a Buttler single. News just in from Cricket Australia. Smith apparently woke this morning with a deterioration in his condition, which is entirely unsurprising. Hence the very strong argument that he should not have been allowed to bat on yesterday, when there was likely to be some delayed concussion. He\u2019s now been pulled from the match. That will also likely raise some criticism from England, given that yesterday the official line was that Smith\u2019s arm was worse than his head, whereas today his arm is apparently feeling better but his head has ruled him out of the match. My read on the situation would be that there\u2019s no reason to doubt he has a concussion, and the sensible thing is to withdraw him. But it also indicates that he had one yesterday. Being hit around the base of the skull by a ball at 92 miles an hour would make that all but inevitable. 35th over: England 106-4 (Stokes 25, Buttler 11) Little question for Tim Paine. First full over of pace for the day. Your stud bowler in Cummins. Why have you got a deep point instead of a third slip? There\u2019s some logic in cutting off boundaries for aggressive batsmen, but Stokes hasn\u2019t been pounding the rope. Two slips and a gully, and Cummins draws a thick edge that splits them for four. Stokes decides that luck must be with him, and clouts the next ball over cover with a diagonal slap for another boundary. Fast runs could be a good idea: that will put the match beyond Australia much more surely than batting time. And on this final day there might be a ball with your name on it any minute. Something similar to Cummins\u2019 next one, that swerves back into Stokes up the hill, past his leave and over the bails. 34th over: England 98-4 (Stokes 17, Buttler 11) With those previous four balls out of the way, we have a minimum of 88 overs to be bowled today, with play resuming 1 hour and 10 minutes late. Good luck with that. We might be here until 10pm. Lyon bowls the first full over from the Nursery End, and Buttler knocks away a single for the day\u2019s first run. Stokes leaves a wide ball, then defends a straight one. Lyon is around the wicket to the left-hander, hoping to spin one for an edge or straighten one for a leg-before. Stokes is reaching for another ball to block it, that\u2019s not a great sign for the batsman. He stabs a straighter ball off his pads for his first run of the day. He was dropped at slip yesterday from Lyon and was nearly bowled leaving a ball. 33rd over: England 96-4 (Stokes 16, Buttler 10) And we\u2019re away, with Pat Cummins to finish the over that was interrupted by rain last night, with four balls to come. Bright sunshine bathing the ground now, as he hangs four balls outside off stump, and Stokes flirts with two of them but doesn\u2019t nick. No score, England\u2019s lead stays at 104. According to Gavin Robertson (\u201cnot the famous cricketing one\u201d) Sara-Marie popped up on telly in Australia last year. \u201cShe\u2019s \u2018started an online business, Words on Rice, selling personalised grains of rice that she writes names or messages on\u2019, according to that organ of record Who Magazine. I wonder how that\u2019s going?\u201d It sounds allrice. If you want to hang out with Sara-Marie instead of me for a bit, here she is. So, been getting a few emails from grumpy Australians. Let\u2019s do this once and do it properly. The Archer \u2018story\u2019 is a massive beat-up driven entirely (surprise surprise) by the Australian arm of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s sport empire. They will be delighted at all the clicks they\u2019re getting because of people engaging. And the fact we\u2019re even discussing it means they\u2019ve got what they want, which is disappointing. The contention is that Archer is bad because he didn\u2019t rush up to Smith after hitting him, and also some time later he was speaking to Jos Buttler and briefly smiled. There\u2019s a split-second screenshot of the latter which is misleading. Things have been getting very ugly online, where a whole lot of people who are apparently very concerned about decency and decorum in cricket have expressed this by going to Archer\u2019s social media accounts to call him \u201ca f***ing dog c**t\u201d and other similar expressions of... economic anxiety, are we calling it? The whole thing is invented and it\u2019s obscene. Several players rushed up to Smith as soon as he was hit. Archer was obviously a bit confused, he started walking back to his mark and then turned around. By this stage there was already a crowd around the batsman, who was moving. When someone is badly hurt, aside from the first person checking that they\u2019re breathing and in a stable position, the best thing to do is stay out of the way so they can get medical assistance. When you\u2019re really in a bad way you need a doctor, not an enquiry after your health. In any case, the idea that you should pile onto a player in his first Test because he didn\u2019t do exactly what you think he should have done, in the brief moments following a fast-moving and quite distressing episode, is completely unreasonable. Everyone out there is a human being. Let\u2019s not waste the day going back and forth over it. Ah, that\u2019s more like it. The sky is blue again over Lord\u2019s. It didn\u2019t take long. No doubt somewhere some birds are singing too. The hover cover bother is over. The pitch is exposed to the sunshine. The last covers are being rolled up and fastened to a buggy. The Australian bowlers are out there warming up on the practice strip, while a couple of catchers are in the cordon. A few English players are having a round of footer, how quaint. What do you do if you\u2019re a batsman who is already out at this stage of the game? Do you have to show up for moral support or can you just stay in bed? In preparation for the resumption of play I\u2019m going to make a cup of tea and handover to the author of the Wisden Book of the Year. In the manner of a radio commentary changeover, the next post you see should be read in the voice of Geoff Lemon. Morning Bill, morning all. (In Europe, any rate.) Thanks to the inestimable Jonathan Pugh Howcroft for steering the rainy morning chat. You may now address your ideas of genius to me. I can affirm from Lord\u2019s that one half of the covers has come off, the wicket square assuming the off-the-shoulder look that was big in Australia in the early 2000s thanks to a Big Brother contestant whose name I can\u2019t recall. She was big on lip gloss, too, I think? Not Sara-Marie, we\u2019ll never forget her. I wonder what she\u2019s doing now. Berkshire residents, Ian Copestake needs you! \u201cAny news from Slough on the future weather at Lord\u2019s?\u201d A couple of you have suggested Ivan has confused his Woolmers and WIllis\u2019s. Glen Thomas: \u201cI think that your correspondent might have meant Bob Willis? RGD\u2019s 1981 third test spell was one of the best I\u2019ve seen. Did he not also hit Iqbal Qasim in the face, even though IQ was a night watchman? Bowling short at the tail end used not to be The Thing To Do.\u201d Indeed he did, in 1978. News! There will be a pitch inspection in 20 minutes. We\u2019re still waiting for the weather to clear and play to resume. \u201cSurely Archer singular\u201d emails Jon Humphries. Perhaps, I just wonder how hummable a tune that is for the uninitiated. \u201cThere\u2019s been lots of indignation about Archer\u2019s behaviour after he hit Smith for the second time,\u201d emails Graham Pierce. \u201cEnquiring after the wellbeing of someone you\u2019ve hit for a second time with a 93mph bouncer is platitudinous. If you\u2019re really worried about them then don\u2019t bowl short pitched deliveries or at 93 mph - which is going to make cricket a whole lot less of an enthralling contest, but considerably safer. Complaints I\u2019ve read about about this bowling being unfair, brutal or intimidatory seem to be made by people who don\u2019t remember Mitchell Johnson destroying the England batting lineup in 2013-4 with exceptional pace bowling, a lot of it pretty short. They forget Michael Clarke telling James Anderson to face up and get ready for a broken arm. And they forget Stuart Broad getting bounced in more or less every game since get got hit in the face. It\u2019s part of the game and has been since Phil Hughes\u2019 death as much as it was beforehand. The change made after Hughes\u2019 death was better protection at the back of the head and upper neck which has been optional and which Steve Smith hasn\u2019t used up to now. In cycling helmets were recommended after the death of Fabio Casartelli in 1995 and only made mandatory after the death of Andre Kivilev 8 years later. It is to be hoped that the ICC will not make the same mistake the UCI did and sit on their hands.\u201d \u201cHere on a Greek island with five cricket non-believers who were converted by yesterday\u2019s extraordinary drama,\u201d humblebrags Gary by email, \u201cwho are now wondering what\u2019s happening at Lord\u2019s?\u201d Tell them to put their feet up and pour another ouzo because it is raining. \u201cIn my youth I think there were two genuine English quickies that used to get the heart ticking\u201d emails Ivan Kinsman, \u201cJohn Snow and Bob Woolmer. And abroad watching the duo of Lillee-Thomson was spell-binding, as was Michael Holding, Joel Garner, Curtley Ambrose, Malcolm Marshall and the like. Let\u2019s hope in the modern game Jofra Archer can join this pantheon.\u201d Paul Griffin has probably ended the conversation around an Archer theme tune with, um, The Archers theme tune. I know a few of you out there are searching for the TMS link for overseas listeners, well, thanks to Peter Haining, here it is. Confirmation of the delayed start to play. Interesting post Gary. It does feel somewhat as though that particular horse has bolted. There are limits on bouncers of course but outside of that everything seems fair game. And to some extent, why shouldn\u2019t it? Batsmen are better protected than ever before and pitches less conducive to the type of bounce that could catch a professional dangerously off guard. That said, I\u2019ve just finished reading Arlott, Swanton and the Soul of English Cricket and it made me think about issues like this, and how what might be termed paternalistic attitudes to governance have been replaced. Adam Levine has chimed in with a Jofra Archer theme song, and he\u2019s conjured a genuinely chilling image in my mind of 20,000 Lord\u2019s patrons tunelessly humming Ride of the Valkyries (aka Kill the Wabbit for non-opera fans). \u201cI love the smell of Archer in the morning!\u201d. Thanks Adam. Private Frazer\u2019s logged on. Weather update: the covers are still on and the band of rain that is blowing through continues to irritate. However, the general scene is improving and although a delay to the scheduled start looks inevitable we shouldn\u2019t lose too much time. \u201cCan it be that England have decided that if they can\u2019t get Smith out they\u2019ll set out to make him afraid by peppering him with brutality?\u201d asks Peter Best. \u201cIt\u2019s looking quite like a plan.\u201d And it\u2019s a plan I don\u2019t object to. The short ball has been a legitimate device for fielding sides throughout cricket history. If England are deemed to overstep the mark the umpires are there to enforce the rules. \u201cShould we really be talking about Steve Smith\u2019s \u2018courage\u2019?\u201d asks Ed Rostron. \u201cHe looked very shaky after coming back out and we saw recently with Hashim Amla that the immediate concussion tests aren\u2019t reliable. A second blow could have had serious consequences and it was foolhardy in the extreme for him to play on.\u201d \u201cGood morning Jonathan,\u201d good morning Kim Thonger. \u201cAs the day ahead is very likely to revolve around the performance and fortunes of Jofra Archer I do think we ought to have a tune to hum collectively as a nation when he\u2019s running in. I\u2019d like to propose ABC\u2019s 80s hit, Poison Arrow, unless anyone has a better idea?\u201d Hmmm, The William Tell Overture? The rights and wrongs of Steve Smith returning to bat after suffering such a fearful blow to the back of his head will be debated long after this Test has finished. Australian coach Justin Langer assured reporters after play yesterday that his star batsman had passed all the necessary medical tests to be allowed back into the arena. He wouldn\u2019t have gone out there unless we thought he was OK. We asked him over and over again. I asked him behind closed doors two or three and times and in front of the group. What else do you do? The medics cleared him, he wanted to get out there. While Jofra Archer has provided England fans with at least one reason to be upbeat, the form of Joe Root is becoming cause for alarm, as Ali Martin reports. There is a final day still to be negotiated in this Test match, one that is positively pregnant with possibilities, but it is safe to say that Joe Root the batsman will be glad to see the back of Lord\u2019s for another year. Jofra Archer announced himself to the cricketing world at Lord\u2019s yesterday. Andy Bull was there to witness every exhilarating minute. There can\u2019t have been many men who have ever bowled quicker for England. Old hands ticked off the possibles: Devon Malcolm, perhaps, against South Africa at the Oval in 1994, or Frank Tyson, on the 1954-55 Ashes tour. The bars were empty now, and the crowd was baying for more. Archer was into the sixth over of his spell, but bowling faster than he had all match. As soon as Smith was back on strike, he bounced him again. Smith threw another loose hook and the ball flew just past the fielder at backward square leg for four. And then it happened. Richard Hirst has done the math(s). \u201cWith the run-rate consistently below 3 rpo England need to bat for about 30 overs and get 185 ahead. Unlikely to get 98 overs in the day, so that should make them safe, then all they have to do is take 10 wickets!\u201d There are so many incredible permutations to work through if you\u2019re so inclined. Such is the potential firepower in each batting line-up but also the capacity to collapse in quicktime, almost all outcomes can be envisaged. Ahead of the impending chaos, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re all on the same page. Here\u2019s Vic Marks on the state of play. A mid-afternoon duel between two contrasting, charismatic characters eclipsed the match situation at Lord\u2019s for a while. For once the back-page headlines were trustworthy. The critical contest was between Jofra Archer, England\u2019s newest and fastest paceman, and Steve Smith, the indomitable former Test captain of Australia returning to his cherished natural habitat in the middle order, and it had a full house spellbound. \u201cHow late do you think they can play before the light gets too bad?\u201d asks Tim Harnedy. \u201cWith the generally slow over rate, and the rain possibly delaying the start of play, I wonder whether there might be a nail-biting finish at half past seven in the evening as the gloom descends.\u201d I think that\u2019s a plausible scenario Tim. Sunset is 8.18pm tonight apparently, so as close to that as the umpire\u2019s dare I would suggest - with the assistance of floodlights, of course. You have to get up bright and early to beat Matthew Tom to the first email of the day. \u201cHow\u2019s the weather at Lord\u2019s?\u201d he asks. \u201cOn my way on a train between Reading and London and it\u2019s sheeting down out the window.\u201d It is gloomy. The covers are on. There has been rain this morning, but it is forecast to have passed by the scheduled start time or just afterwards. No further rain is expected for the remainder of the day. Deep breath everybody... and let\u2019s begin. Welcome to day five of the second Ashes Test from Lord\u2019s. We embark on the final day\u2019s play of this gripping Test with every result still possible. And there\u2019s probably an equal chance of the obvious three occurring after yesterday\u2019s enthralling action left us with England 104-runs ahead but with only six second innings wickets in hand. But even this tantalising situation cannot do justice to the drama and spectacle that led up to it. Yesterday will live long in the memory for Jofra Archer\u2019s venom, Steve Smith\u2019s courage, and a fevered atmosphere so rarely seen in the five-day format. How could that possibly be topped? Well, with the weather set fair enough and a full house crammed into Lord\u2019s, I\u2019m getting those tingles like it\u2019s 2005 all over again. I\u2019ll be with you for the next hour or so but once play begins Geoff Lemon will talk some sense into you. If you want to join in this pre-play fun before Geoff arrives you can drop me an email or a tweet.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s No 10 operation is increasingly on an election footing, with leaked internal emails revealing he was due to meet the political strategist Sir Lynton Crosby. As Conservative advisers come under intense pressure to produce manifesto ideas quickly, a well placed source said Johnson had a meeting set up in the next few days with Crosby, the election guru who worked on the campaigns of David Cameron in 2015 and Theresa May in 2017. The meeting had been due to be attended by just Johnson and Sir Eddie Lister, his chief strategic adviser. However, in a sign of the jostling for power and preferment within No 10, some other advisers demanded to be present \u2013 including Danny Kruger, the prime minister\u2019s new political secretary \u2013 and the meeting was taken out of the diary. Johnson is a longtime friend of Crosby, who worked on his London mayoral campaigns, and the pair are understood to have talked informally on the phone regularly during his leadership campaign. The Australian strategist and polling expert would very probably be a key figure in any general election campaign, despite the two having disagreed in recent months over the role of the prime minister\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds. One Tory aide described numerous power struggles going on inside Downing Street. Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s most senior aide, is in the ascendancy along with other former Vote Leave staffers, but there is another powerful faction around Symonds, and a third around Lister\u2019s group of former City Hall advisers. Johnson himself claims he does not want an election but it is understood there is increasing activity at No 10 aimed at laying the groundwork for a campaign, with voter-friendly announcements being brought forward to the first two weeks of September. A source familiar with No 10\u2019s thinking said this was the fortnight regarded by Downing Street as the time of \u201cmaximum danger\u201d to Johnson, when MPs could potentially force through legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October or move to a vote of no confidence in the prime minister that could bring the government down. The announcements will be aimed partly at reminding Conservative MPs that their seats depend on Johnson\u2019s performance in a general election, and a warning shot to Labour that the prime minister is prepared to fight at the polls on their traditional territory of public services, schools and the NHS. At a meeting on Friday, Cummings told special advisers that they had a week to come up with ideas that could be used during an election campaign. One aide at the meeting said they had been told to go back to their departments and fill a page with ideas, even though Conservative party headquarters is notionally in charge of policy formation for an election. \u201cThe tone [on whether or not to go to the polls] was: this is not in our gift any more. Come back with some policy ideas that we can deploy in an election,\u201d the adviser said. No 10 is adamant that there must be no election before Brexit on 31 October, with Cummings insistent that Johnson could schedule a poll for after that date. However, Cummings did acknowledge the likelihood that an election would be forced on Johnson by parliament before he might want one, and that the goal would be to \u201csmash Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. Corbyn has said he will force a vote of no confidence on Johnson at the earliest opportunity when it is winnable, and has offered to form a caretaker government to prevent a no-deal Brexit before holding a general election. This has been dismissed by the Liberal Democrats, and various independent MPs would rather there were a temporary caretaker government led by a figure such as Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman, who are not long-term contenders for the job of prime minister. If opposition MPs and rebel Tories cannot agree on a strategy for legislating against no deal or toppling Johnson, he could attempt to bypass parliament and pursue a no-deal Brexit regardless, holding a general election some time after that.",

      "bodyText": "Feral cats are not just predators that kill large numbers of Australian wildlife, they may also be spreading parasitic disease to native animal species, according to new research analysing the impact of cat populations in South Australia. The study, published in the journal Wildlife Research, examined Toxoplasma gondii (T gondii), a cat-borne parasite that can cause the disease Toxoplasmosis in a range of species. Researchers tested western grey kangaroos that had been culled on Kangaroo Island for the presence of the animal antibody to the parasite. Kangaroo Island has high populations of feral cats and the results from the samples were compared to another site on the Fleurieu Peninsula on the mainland, where feral cats are present but in much lower numbers. About 10 kangaroos were sampled on the mainland and then on the island at two month intervals for a year and tested for T. gondii antibodies. The test results showed a significant difference in the presence of antibodies when the two sites were compared, with 20% of culled kangaroos they tested on the island producing a positive result, while none of the culled kangaroos on the mainland tested positive. The researchers also tested road-killed western grey kangaroos on the island to see if there was a higher prevalence of antibodies in those animals than the culled kangaroos. Their samples of 102 kangaroos found as roadkill produced an almost identical result, with 21% testing positive for the antibody. In another set of tests, the scientists looked at road-killed tammar wallabies and found 15% produced a positive result. Patrick Taggart, an adjunct fellow at Adelaide University and the study\u2019s lead author, said past research had shown that cats on Kangaroo Island had a higher prevalence of the parasite when compared to the mainland.

Taggart said eradication of feral cats was required to alleviate the prevalence of the parasite and the disease, and there were steps being taken towards this. \u201cMost people when they think of cats, predation is all they think of,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this shows where there are cats they are likely also having other impacts.\u201d",

The All Blacks are now in possession of the Bledisloe Cup for an unprecedented 17th year in a row. The Trans-Tasman rivalry is no longer just lopsided, the Kiwi dominance is the status quo. But Bledisloe Cup form does not always translate into World Cup form. The Wallabies showed what they are capable of in Perth, but they cannot always rely on their opponents having an off day or the weather being fine. By the way, has anyone checked the long-term weather forecast for Japan between 20 September and 2 November?",

      "bodyText": "America\u2019s military authority is waning and it is ill-prepared to go to war with China in the Indo-Pacific region, a new report from the United States Studies Centre has warned, arguing Australia must move towards a shared reliance on a network of allies, in particular Asian militaries such as Japan, for its security. The report, Averting Crisis, says America\u2019s defence strategy in the Indo-Pacific region is in \u201cthe throes of an unprecedented crisis\u201d, created by a mismatch between its ambition to remain the region\u2019s dominant military power, and an overstretched armed force with falling and failing resources. \u201cFaced with an increasingly contested regional security landscape and with limited defence resources at its disposal, the United States military is no longer assured of its ability to single-handedly uphold a favourable balance of power in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d the report, by the US Studies Centre\u2019s Ashley Townshend and Brendan Thomas-Noone, says. \u201cChina, by contrast, is growing ever more capable of challenging the regional order by force as a result of its large-scale investment in advanced military systems.\u201d The US will remain influential \u2013 it still spends broadly as much on defence as the next eight largest national defence budgets combined \u2013 but its military has been overstretched by two decades of counter-insurgency wars in the Middle East, and faces continuing global commitments, ageing equipment, and training cuts. And while America wants to remain the dominant military power in the Indo-Pacific region, it faces growing deficits and rising public debt, as well as political resistance to continuing increases in military spending. The US has been forced to prioritise \u201cthe urgent over the important,\u201d Townshend told the Guardian. \u201cChina, by contrast, doesn\u2019t yet have global responsibilities, it has regional responsibilities.\u201d Australia can no longer rely on the US alone for its security in the Indo-Pacific region, and should boost its \u201ccollective defence\u201d networks, aggregating its military capabilities with those of allied nations such as Japan, the report says. Townshend says Australia should also look to increase co-operation with other militaries in the region, such as Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. \u201cThe US has said Asia is their priority, but they don\u2019t behave like it is. A strategy of collective defence is fast becoming necessary as a way of offsetting shortfalls in America\u2019s regional military power and holding the line against rising Chinese strength.\u201d The report says Australia should also consider acquiring its own land-based anti-ship missiles \u2013 a move forecast in the 2016 defence white paper \u2013 and increase its stockpiles of munitions and fuel \u201crequired for high-end conflict\u201d. US-China relations have deteriorated over the past year, ostensibly over trade, but the rhetoric over other points of tension \u2013 in particular Chinese militarisation in the South China Sea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan \u2013 has grown increasingly belligerent in recent months. Australia , a strategic ally of the US, has found itself consistently dragged into the dispute. This month, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the Australian defence minister, Linda Reynolds, had to scotch speculation that America planned to ask Australian permission to station its missiles on Australian territory near Darwin. Pompeo struck a hawkish tone in Sydney, saying Australia could be forced to choose between its strategic alliance with the US, and its largest trading relationship with China. \u201cYou can sell your soul for a pile of soy beans, or you can protect your people,\u201d he said, arguing that the world had been too passive in responding to China as it \u201cbegan to behave in ways it had not done before\u201d. \u201cThe efforts to steal data across networks \u2026 or efforts to militarise the South China Sea, something president Xi promised the world he would not do, or engage in activities where they foist money on nations that are desperate for resources and leave them trapped in debt positions which ultimately aren\u2019t about commercial transactions but about political control.\u201d He said the US would stand up to Beijing, demanding that it adhere to the global international rules-based order. The US ambassador to Australia was more conciliatory last week, saying America was not in a cold war with China, and was not seeking to provoke a hot one.

But he added: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until someone, inspired by Donald Trump, drove more than 600 miles, to my hometown, and killed 22 people in my community with a weapon of war, an AK-47, that he had no business owning, that no American should own, unless they are on a battlefield, engaged with the enemy. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until that moment that I truly understood how critical this moment is and the real consequence and cost of Donald Trump.\u201d The mosque in Victoria burned down on 28 January 2017, the day after Trump signed an executive order which sought to temporarily bar from the US people from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia and to suspend or limit refugee admissions. The culprit in the fire was convicted in July 2018 and sentenced to 24 years in prison. The suspect in the shooting at an El Paso Walmart has been linked to a \u201cmanifesto\u201d in which Trump policies were cited. He surrendered to police, who have said he has confessed to wanting to kill Mexicans. O\u2019Rourke is off the pace in the Democratic field, sixth in the realclearpolitics.com national polling average. But his campaigning has gained new urgency and his attacks on Trump new vigour since the shooting in the city he represented in the US House from 2013 to the start of this year. This week, O\u2019Rourke rejected suggestions he should drop out and run again for the Senate, having pushed the Republican Ted Cruz in 2018. O\u2019Rourke told NBC he had seen danger inherent to Trump\u2019s policies and behaviour again \u201cyesterday, in Mississippi, in Canton, in a community where nearly 700 people working in chicken processing plants, one of the toughest jobs in America, were raided, detained, taken from their kids, humiliated, hogtied, for the crime of being in this country, doing a job that no one else will do\u201d. Raids on Mississippi food processing plants by US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or Ice, caused national outcry this month. The operation against undocumented migrants was carried out just after the El Paso shooting and a controversial visit to the Texas city by Trump himself. Setting off for that visit, Trump told reporters those criticising him in connection with shootings \u201care political people. They\u2019re trying to make points. In many cases they\u2019re running for president, and they\u2019re very low in the polls. A couple of them in particular, very low in the polls\u201d. On NBC on Sunday, O\u2019Rourke said: \u201cThere is a concerted, organised attack against immigrants, against people of colour, against those who do not look like or pray like or love like the majority in this country. \u201cAnd this moment will define us one way or another. And if we do not wake up to it, I am convinced that we\u2019ll lose America, this country, in our sleep. And we cannot allow that to happen.\u201d",

Usually, when a Big Six team hosts a member of the Peedie 14, it feels like the game will be a formality. It gives me the greatest pleasure to report that, today, that isn\u2019t the case. Leicester will come to play, as Brendan Rodgers\u2019s sides always do, and have the ability to give Chelsea\u2019s defence another trying afternoon.</p> \n  <p>Chelsea had a miserable start to the season, losing 4-0 in that peculiar match at Old Trafford, but there was plenty of encouragement in their Super Cup performance against Liverpool. N\u2019Golo Kante makes such a difference to their team, while the important Antonio Rudiger should be back soon.</p> \n  <p>Both teams have an abundance of neat, technical attacking midfielders, so this should be good fun. A win for Leicester would be a decent statement of intent to infiltrate the top six; a win for Chelsea would end this dispiriting nonsense about Frank Lampard being under pressure.</p> \n  <p><strong>Kick off is at 4.30pm.</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-18T14:44:00.375Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Not a classic homecoming ... Jacob Steinberg has filed his match report, so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company - goodnight. Post-match interviews James Maddison \u201cWe\u2019re coming away disappointed. We had chances, myself included, and when you play as well as we did in the second half you have to score the chances we create. I need to improve my goal tally if I want to go to the next level, which I know I can. Chances like that don\u2019t come around very often. I\u2019ve gotta put it away. \u201cThe reaction of Wilfred was brilliant. He showed so much character to come back from a mistake like that to control the game and then score the equaliser. He doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserve - he does the part of the game that nobody else wants to do.\u201d Wilfred Ndidi \u201cIt\u2019s something I try not to think about [the mistake] but it still comes up in my head. I didn\u2019t know he was there. It\u2019s a mixed feeling scoring the equaliser. We did very well in the second half and we\u2019ll try to take that to the next game.\u201d That was a game of two distinct 45-minute segments. Chelsea were good in the first half and deserved to lead; Leicester were brilliant in the second and deserved at least an equaliser. James Maddison was both the best player on the pitch and the biggest culprit; he missed a sitter that would have given Leicester the lead. Wilfred Ndidi was the biggest influence on the match. He gifted Mason Mount a goal on his home debut, and then equalised with a sympathic, humane, kindly header. Peep peep! 90+4 min Chelsea are hanging on for a point. Kepa has to run 35 yards from his own goal to just beat Albrighton to a loose ball. 90+3 min Maddison, flagged offside, puts the ball in the net anyway. I don\u2019t think VAR can have anything to do with such incidents, though I haven\u2019t a clue anymore. 90+2 min \u201cI can\u2019t help but feel that Chelsea\u2019s season is going to be less defined by their manager than the quality of players at their disposal,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cLet\u2019s see if they can get an extra year out of the old dogs because I\u2019m not convinced by the whelps.\u201d They have some good players to come back \u2013 Rudiger, Loftus-Cheek and eventually Hudson-Odoi. 90+2 min: Another chance for Vardy! Ricardo drove a low cross into the six-yard box, where Vardy tried a backheel at the near post and made a mess of it. It was a tricky one as it was behind him, and he mistimed the connection. 90 min Four minutes of added time. Tielemans has a chance to put Vardy through but hangs onto the ball too long. Chelsea break through Kante and then Abraham, who curls miles wide frokm the edge of the area. 89 min A brilliant move from Leicester! Maddison curls a pass out to Albrighton on the right. He cuts it back sharply to Tielemans, who whips it first-time towards goal from 15 yards, and Kepa stands tall to beat the shot away. It was straight at him, essentially, but beautifully struck. Leicester have been a pleasure to watch in this second half, Maddison in particular. He\u2019s ready for international football, nae question. 86 min Mount plays a one-two with Abraham and hits a fierce shot from 25 yards that goes behind off Soyuncu. The corner, from Willian, is a stinker. 83 min Mount wafts a free-kick over the bar from 30 yards. Chelsea have lost their way. They might still nick it - Big Six teams do that a lot at home - but the second-half performance has been as deflating as the first was encouraging. 82 min I think Chelsea would take a draw now, as Leicester look the more likely winners. Mind you, so did England against Romania at France 98. 81 min \u201cThis is the third game in a row in which Chelsea have been superb in the first half, slack in the second,\u201d says Julian Menz. \u201cDoes Frank need to do some extra work on his half-time pep talks?\u201d 80 min Marc Albrighton replaces the disappointing Ayoze Perez. He\u2019s a fine player but his decision-making has been poor today. 80 min Although he missed that great chance, Maddison has been magnificent in the second half. 79 min Maddison plays a good pass to Tielemans. He plays an even better one to Perez, who has the chance to slip Vardy in behind the defence ... and he makes a Horlicks of it. 77 min: Vardy almost makes it 2-1! Maddison put him through on the left of the area with a lovely disguised pass. Vardy took a touch and then hammered the ball low across goal with his left foot. Kepa plunged to his left and the ball whistled just wide of the far post. 75 min \u201cYour description of Ndidi\u2019s goal,\u201d says Zafar Sobhan. \u201cAn emphatic header, perhaps?\u201d That\u2019s my new favourite typo. 74 min Almost a chance at the other end, with Pedro\u2019s excellent cross just evading the leaping Abraham in the area. 73 min: What a miss from Maddison! Leicester should be 2-1 up. Fuchs\u2019 sharp low cross was touched off by Perez to Maddison, who ran through a couple of defenders in the area to create a clear opportunity. And then he leathered it over the bar from eight yards. 72 min Leicester make another substitution, with the debutant Dennis Praet replacing Hamza Choudhury. 71 min A double change for Chelsea: Willian and Kovacic replace Jorginho and Pulisic, who had a quiet home debut. 70 min Ricardo drags a shot well wide from 25 yards. But it\u2019s another reflection of Leicester\u2019s bullishness. They\u2019ve been quite superb in the second half, Maddison in particular. He\u2019s a beautiful player. Wilfred Ndidi has scored at both ends! Sort of. His desperate mistake led to Chelsea\u2019s goal but now he has equalised with an empathic header from Maddison\u2019s outswinging corner. He got in front of Azpilicueta, eight yards from goal, and powered it into the top corner. It\u2019s there! 66 min Fuchs\u2019 deflected cross loops over the backpedalling Kepa and onto the roof of the net. That was close. 64 min Perez\u2019s clever through ball is just too far in front of Vardy. 61 min Maddison\u2019s corner is headed away to Tielemans, who shoots high and wide rom 25 yards. Chelsea then make their first substitution, with Tammy Abraham replacing the excellent Olivier Giroud. 60 min Maddison robs Pedro and tries to stab a through ball to Vardy. Christensen puts it behind for a corner. 60 min It\u2019s hard to reconcile Leicester\u2019s listless, meek first-half performance with how well they have played since half-time. 58 min Lovely play from Maddison, who twists Christensen inside out on the left side of the area before hammering a left-footed cross-shot that flashes across the six-yard box. 57 min When the corner is half cleared, Choudhury tries to place a curling shot from the left side of the box. It\u2019s too close to Kepa, who makes a comfortable tumbling save. 56 min Pedro is struggling. It looked very innocous, as he kicked the underside of Perez\u2019s boot on the edge of the Leicester area, but he is limping heavily as he leaves the field. 55 min Pedro is down but Leicester play on and win a corner, which doesn\u2019t impress the home fans. 53 min This is much better from Leicester, and Chelsea have gone up a gear in response. Emerson\u2019s cross is flicked towards goal by the head of Giroud, and Schmeichel makes a comfortable save. 50 min A half-chance for Leicester. Maddison runs at the Chelsea defence, just outside the area. Kante gets a tackle in but Maddison picks up the loose ball, dances round the outrushing Kepa and slides the ball back from the byline towards Tielemans near the penalty spot. Mount nips in front of him to make an important clearance. 48 min Maddison stabs a through pass to Vardy, who is offside. It\u2019s been a bright start from Leicester, though. 47 min Perez tries to dink a pass over the top for Vardy. Christensen stretches to head it towards the edge of the area, where Maddison shapes for the volley and then loses his balance. 46 min Peep peep! Leicester begin the second half. Half-time reading Peep peep! Chelsea lead, deservedly so, through Mason Mount\u2019s early goal. It was all his own work: he robbed Wilfred Ndidi just outside the area and finished adroitly. 45 min One minute of added time. 44 min A microcosm of Leicester\u2019s first half: Ricardo takes a throw-in to Perez, who cushions a short return pass to Ricardo. He miscontrols it and it goes out of play. 42 min Chelsea have become a little passive, apparently content to go to half-time with a 1-0 lead. Leicester have had 71 per cent possession in the last 10 minutes. 40 min \u201cPedro has been excellent in this game so far, pressing, defending from the front and quick in the transition,\u201d says Lee Madden. \u201cI do wonder though, what position is he actually playing? It looks like a wide forward position but he\u2019s been everywhere. Thoughts?\u201d He\u2019s definitely the right-sided wide forward, but anyone who plays in those positions has a fair bit of freedom these days. 38 min From the resulting free-kick, Maddison curls a wicked ball from the right that just bounces over the stretching Ndidi at the far post. 37 min Jorginho is booked for a late tackle on Tielemans. 35 min Leicester are having an even share of possession now. It\u2019s all in front of Chelsea, though, who look very comfortable defensively at this stage. 30 min Chelsea almost return Ndidi\u2019s favour by giving Leicester a goal. Kepa, who received a pass from Zouma, dithered on the ball and was this close to being robbed by Vardy on the six-yard line. In the end he had to stretch to tackle Vardy and the ball deflected to safety. 28 min Reports of Chelsea\u2019s demise, it seems, were greatly exaggerated. They look an excellent side, and their pressing has been really impressive. 26 min: Great block by Fuchs! Emerson\u2019s near-post cross was flicked behind him by Giroud, who is a fine game. Kante arrived late to steer a shot towards goal from eight yards, but Fuchs slid in from the side to deflect the ball behind for a corner. Brilliant defending. 25 min We\u2019ve seen little of Maddison and even less of Tielemans and Perez in the first 25 minutes. Leicester have been really disappointing. 23 min \u201cGood afternoon Rob,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cSo I see we\u2019re both on a break from the cricket. I hope \u2013 I honestly truly hope \u2013 Lampard gets at least two full seasons to exhibit what he can do with all that young talent Chelsea\u2019s been loaning out for years.\u201d I suspect he will, although you never know with Roman Abramovich. He doesn\u2019t appear to be the sentimental kind. 21 min Another chance for Mount, who heads Azpilicueta\u2019s flat cross straight at Schmeichel from 10 yards. 20 min \u201cSure it was mostly Ndidi\u2019s fault for dawdling &amp; losing ball to Mount, but defender who passed it to Ndidi should share blame,\u201d says Mike MacKenzie. \u201cPassing in front of goal with not one but two forwards near your guy isn\u2019t very smart.\u201d I know what you mean but I think it was essentially a safe pass \u2013 they want to play out from the back and Ndidi had plenty of time to get rid of it. 17 min Ricardo makes a good run forward from right-back, only to overhit his through pass to Vardy. Leicester are settling down, though. 15 min Chelsea have had 60 passes in the opposition half. Leicester have had six. 14 min Leicester are slowly coming into the game, having barely seen the ball in the first 10 minutes. 10 min There has been an eye-catching intensity to Chelsea\u2019s play, with and especially without the ball. Mount was all over Ndidi for the goal. 8 min That was a fine finish from Mount, because he was under pressure from Ndidi and was starting to fall over as he took the shot. But he still managed to screw it back across Schmeichel. Mason Mount scores on his home debut after a lamentable error from Wilfred Ndidi. He dithered for an age on the edge of the D and was robbed by Mount, who moved into the area and screwed an excellent low shot past Schmeichel. It\u2019s there! 6 min This has been such a purposeful start from Chelsea. Leicester have barely crossed the halfway line. 3 min From the resulting corner, Pulisic\u2019s near-post header flashes right across the face of goal before Ricardo hooks it away from inside the six-yard box. Chelsea could be 3-0 up! 2 min Another chance for Chelsea! It was made again by Giroud, who laid the ball off to Mount on the edge of the area. His low shot was pushed away by Schmeichel, who got straight to his feet to block with the follow-up from Pulisic. 1 min Pedro slams a volley into the side-netting after 48 seconds. Azpilicueta\u2019s cross from the right was chested neatly towards him by Giroud, and he belted a volley just wide of the near post. 1 min Peep peep! Chelsea get the match under way. They are in blue; Leicester are in their pink change kit. There\u2019s been a late refereeing substitution, with Oliver Langford replacing Graham Scott, who was - and you\u2019ll like this - stuck in traffic. The players are in the tunnel. Cesar Azpilicueta already looks like he wants to hurt someone. In the early game, Sheffield United\u2019s upbeat start to Premier League life continued with a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace. \u201cHmmm, be honest,\u201d says Matt Dony, \u201chow much attention are you really going to be paying to the football this afternoon?\u201d Mate, I\u2019ve spent the last 30 minutes desperately trying to find a split-screen function on my TV analysing Leicester\u2019s heat maps from last weekend. I\u2019ve got my eyes on the ball. Unlike Marcus Labuschagne, lol. If you\u2019re a cricket fan, you might want to join Tim de Lisle, because Jofra Archer is bowling another monstrous spell at Lord\u2019s. Pre-match reading Sheffield United are playing Crystal Palace in the early game - and you won\u2019t believe the score. Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Kepa; Azpilicueta, Christensen, Zouma, Emerson; Kante, Jorginho; Pedro, Mount, Pulisic; Giroud. Substitutes: Caballero, Alonso, Tomori, Barkley, Kovacic, Abraham, Willian. Leicester (4-1-4-1) Schmeichel; Ricardo, Evans, Soyuncu, Fuchs; Ndidi; Perez, Tielemans, Choudhury, Maddison; Vardy. Substitutes: Ward, Justin, Morgan, Albrighton, Barnes, Praet, Iheanacho. Referee Oliver Langford. Hello. Usually, when a Big Six team hosts a member of the Peedie 14, it feels like the game will be a formality. It gives me the greatest pleasure to report that, today, that isn\u2019t the case. Leicester will come to play, as Brendan Rodgers\u2019s sides always do, and have the ability to give Chelsea\u2019s defence another trying afternoon. Chelsea had a miserable start to the season, losing 4-0 in that peculiar match at Old Trafford, but there was plenty of encouragement in their Super Cup performance against Liverpool. N\u2019Golo Kante makes such a difference to their team, while the important Antonio Rudiger should be back soon. Both teams have an abundance of neat, technical attacking midfielders, so this should be good fun. A win for Leicester would be a decent statement of intent to infiltrate the top six; a win for Chelsea would end this dispiriting nonsense about Frank Lampard being under pressure. Kick off is at 4.30pm.",

      "body": "<p>\u201c\u2018Once the rockets \u200bare up, who cares where they come down? That\u2019s not my department\u2019\u200b, says Wernher von Braun,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjDEsGZLbio\" title=\"\">sang the satirist and mathematician</a> Tom Lehrer in 1965 about the pioneer rocket scientist who worked first for Hitler making V2 weapons and, after 1945, with equal enthusiasm, for Nasa. Now a rather different mathematician, Hannah Fry, who is to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas lectures, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/16/mathematicians-need-doctor-style-hippocratic-oath-says-academic-hannah-fry\" title=\"\">has called for a Hippocratic oath</a> for scientists and technologists to help them carry constantly in their minds the ethical consequences of their work. This is a proposal that deserves serious consideration: if it achieves nothing else, it will help to dispel the idea that technologies like software development are in themselves morally neutral, so that ethics, or morality, can be dealt with by someone else. Those who send the rockets up need to think carefully about where they might come down.</p> <p>There are three obvious issues with her plan. The first, to <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v11/n01/bernard-williams/modernity\" title=\"\">misquote the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre</a>, is \u201cWhose ethics? Which rationality?\u201d There is no single, universal code of ethics to which all scientists around the world subscribe and the wars of the 20th century show how quickly many \u2013 not just Wernher von Braun \u2013 could be recruited to weapons research in the name of defending civilisation. And absolute pacifism has not been a feature of earlier efforts at scientific ethics. The philosopher <a href=\"http://www.unz.com/print/Encounter-1969mar-00052\" title=\"\">Karl Popper proposed in 1969</a> an oath for all students of science; even then, he could, and did, justify some work on nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The second problem is the extreme difficulty of foreseeing the uses to which pure research can be put. There have been a few occasions in recent times when scientists have drawn back from research until some at least of the ethical consequences of its application have become clearer: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asilomar_Conference_on_Recombinant_DNA\" title=\"\">Asilomar moratorium on genetic engineering</a> is the most celebrated. But fundamental research has uses far beyond the imagination of the people who carry it out. No one could blame Alan Turing for YouTube\u2019s role in stirring up extremism.</p> <p>Beyond this horizon of ignorance appears what might be called a horizon of influence: any one individual can only accomplish a limited amount compared to the forces of states and huge businesses. Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the web, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/11/tim-berners-lee-web-inventor-save-internet\" title=\"\">horrified by some of the ways</a> in which it has developed but he has been powerless to stop them. It\u2019s true that collective action can have effects, but these are limited. A revulsion among the workers at Google has so far stopped the company from cooperating with the US immigration service. It has not stopped its YouTube algorithms from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html\" title=\"\">corrupting politics in Brazil</a>. Any effective moral action must come from corporations as a whole, not just some of their workers.</p> <p>But for all these drawbacks, this is still a worthwhile idea. The choice between individual and collective ethics is not either/or. Both are needed. The dominant ideal of the last decades has been boundless selfishness, both individual and corporate. Whatever helps to put limits on that is not just desirable but essential.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201c\u2018Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? That\u2019s not my department\u2019, says Wernher von Braun,\u201d sang the satirist and mathematician Tom Lehrer in 1965 about the pioneer rocket scientist who worked first for Hitler making V2 weapons and, after 1945, with equal enthusiasm, for Nasa. Now a rather different mathematician, Hannah Fry, who is to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas lectures, has called for a Hippocratic oath for scientists and technologists to help them carry constantly in their minds the ethical consequences of their work. This is a proposal that deserves serious consideration: if it achieves nothing else, it will help to dispel the idea that technologies like software development are in themselves morally neutral, so that ethics, or morality, can be dealt with by someone else. Those who send the rockets up need to think carefully about where they might come down. There are three obvious issues with her plan. The first, to misquote the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, is \u201cWhose ethics? Which rationality?\u201d There is no single, universal code of ethics to which all scientists around the world subscribe and the wars of the 20th century show how quickly many \u2013 not just Wernher von Braun \u2013 could be recruited to weapons research in the name of defending civilisation. And absolute pacifism has not been a feature of earlier efforts at scientific ethics. The philosopher Karl Popper proposed in 1969 an oath for all students of science; even then, he could, and did, justify some work on nuclear weapons. The second problem is the extreme difficulty of foreseeing the uses to which pure research can be put. There have been a few occasions in recent times when scientists have drawn back from research until some at least of the ethical consequences of its application have become clearer: the Asilomar moratorium on genetic engineering is the most celebrated. But fundamental research has uses far beyond the imagination of the people who carry it out. No one could blame Alan Turing for YouTube\u2019s role in stirring up extremism. Beyond this horizon of ignorance appears what might be called a horizon of influence: any one individual can only accomplish a limited amount compared to the forces of states and huge businesses. Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the web, is horrified by some of the ways in which it has developed but he has been powerless to stop them. It\u2019s true that collective action can have effects, but these are limited. A revulsion among the workers at Google has so far stopped the company from cooperating with the US immigration service. It has not stopped its YouTube algorithms from corrupting politics in Brazil. Any effective moral action must come from corporations as a whole, not just some of their workers. But for all these drawbacks, this is still a worthwhile idea. The choice between individual and collective ethics is not either/or. Both are needed. The dominant ideal of the last decades has been boundless selfishness, both individual and corporate. Whatever helps to put limits on that is not just desirable but essential.",

Karen Lloyd Curlew campaigner and editor of Curlew Calling Anthology \u2022 Although it is interesting to read that this year\u2019s contributor to the Royal Institution Christmas lectures, Dr Hannah Fry, has raised the idea of a Hippocratic oath for scientists to commit them to think deeply about the broader implications of their work, it is not the first time this has been proposed (Scientists shaping the future \u2018should take the Hippocratic oath like doctors\u2019, 17 August). One of its earliest and most distinguished proponents was the philosopher Sir Karl Popper, who gave a paper on the subject at a conference in Vienna in 1968 in which he recalled taking an oath derived from the Hippocratic oath when he received his doctorate in psychology at the University of Vienna. However, Popper did not restrict himself to scientists, but extended the notion of oath-based moral responsibility to include anyone contributing to the growth of knowledge. He seems to have been thinking in terms of everyone engaged in academic research, which makes sense against the background of the perversion of all academic disciplines that took place under National Socialism in his native Austria. More recently, the notion of a Hippocratic oath specifically for scientists has had its detractors, and these have claimed that such an oath could be inimical to freedom of thought and expression, for instance by being politicised. Dr Fry\u2019s is the latest contribution to this well-established debate, though (to judge by your report) what she proposes does not suggest a way to resolve it.

      "bodyText": "Around the world, humanitarian aid workers operate in dangerous and difficult environments and here in South Sudan we know that many aid workers and peacekeepers have lost their lives while trying to protect and assist South Sudanese communities. Among them have been women who play a vital role in every aspect of crisis response, and particularly in preventing, responding to, and working with survivors of gender-based violence. We also know that men and women in the humanitarian sector experience differing risks in violent operational settings. While men in the humanitarian sector experience three to six times higher attack rates than women overall, female humanitarians are affected disproportionately by gender-based violence, including sexual assault and rape. Gender-based violence has the potential to inflict significant long-term harm on humanitarians who experience violence in the workplace, at home or in the field, and it is our responsibility as humanitarian actors to support each other and to manage these risks effectively. Under-reporting is a serious challenge to measure the problem of violence against female workers and today is an opportunity for us to commit to better (and gender-specific) reporting going forward. As we mark World Humanitarian Day, honour those that have lost their lives, and celebrate the hundreds of thousands of women humanitarians across the world, we want to enact stronger accountability measures to end sexual violence against workers, as well as promote women\u2019s participation and leadership in humanitarian response to encourage, support and act as role models for other women and girls.

No matter. Ollie Robinson took a career best eight for 34 as <strong>Middlesex</strong> were bowled out for 75. Robinson bowled 11 overs unchanged from the Cromwell Road End to knock Jeetan Patel off the top spot for producing the best bowling figures in the Championship this season. As he led his team off the pitch, Robinson was presented with his county cap by the Sussex captain, Ben Brown. Sussex faltered in reply, but amassed a lead of 53.</p> <p>At Edgbaston, 19-year-old Rob Yates made his debut first-class century, hitting 22 fours in his 133 not out, as <strong>Warwickshire</strong> flew almost out of sight of second-placed <strong>Somerset</strong>. Dom Sibley fell for a duck. </p> <p>Luke Wood reduced <strong>Yorkshire</strong> to 38 for five at Scarborough, much to the displeasure of the festival crowd. Jonny Tattersall won them back with 92, in a stand of 121 with Tim Bresnan \u2013 whose last three Championship fifties have all come against <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong>. Notts were 41 without loss at the close, in search of their first Championship win of the season. </p> <p>James Vince made 47 at the Oval as <strong>Hampshire</strong> reached 222 for seven against <strong>Surrey</strong> on a rain-truncated day. The weather also intervened at Canterbury where <strong>Essex</strong>\u2019s Sam Cook and Mohammad Amir, playing the final red-ball game of his career, took three wickets each against <strong>Kent</strong>. Daniel Bell-Drummond made 50.</p> <p>In Division Two, six of <strong>Worcestershire</strong>\u2019s top seven batsmen made a grand total of nine, the other, Moeen Ali, playing his first Championship game of the year, made 42. No 10 Joe Leach then hit 53 as the last three wickets dragged Worcester to respectability. Fifties from Alex Wakely and Rob Keogh guided <strong>Northamptonshire</strong> to within touching distance by the close. </p> <p>At Chester-le-Street Alex Lees stepped into the shoes of Cameron Bancroft with a wonderful 181, his highest score for <strong>Durham</strong>, to leave Leicestershire struggling.</p> <p>Ryan Higgins took five for 54 against <strong>Derbyshire</strong> to put high-flying <strong>Gloucestershire </strong>in control at the County Ground. And at Colwyn Bay, Tom Bailey and Danny Lamb took four wickets each as <strong>Glamorgan</strong> were bowled out in two sessions. But <strong>Lancashire </strong>were thwarted at the last by a 10th-wicket partnership of 52. Samit Patel, on loan to Glamorgan for the rest of the season, hit 54.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d599a398f084f687f358d2c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-18T18:41:53.809Z\">7.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A great day\u2019s cricket round the grounds! </strong>I was a bit distracted by Ollie Robinson\u2019s exploits - but what deeds from north to south .

      "bodyText": "County Championship cricket returned for a one-off August special, and strained every sinew to grab a little attention from Lord\u2019s. In the crucial second division game at Hove, Sussex were missing Jofra Archer, Chris Jordan and Tymal Mills. No matter. Ollie Robinson took a career best eight for 34 as Middlesex were bowled out for 75. Robinson bowled 11 overs unchanged from the Cromwell Road End to knock Jeetan Patel off the top spot for producing the best bowling figures in the Championship this season. As he led his team off the pitch, Robinson was presented with his county cap by the Sussex captain, Ben Brown. Sussex faltered in reply, but amassed a lead of 53. At Edgbaston, 19-year-old Rob Yates made his debut first-class century, hitting 22 fours in his 133 not out, as Warwickshire flew almost out of sight of second-placed Somerset. Dom Sibley fell for a duck. Luke Wood reduced Yorkshire to 38 for five at Scarborough, much to the displeasure of the festival crowd. Jonny Tattersall won them back with 92, in a stand of 121 with Tim Bresnan \u2013 whose last three Championship fifties have all come against Nottinghamshire. Notts were 41 without loss at the close, in search of their first Championship win of the season. James Vince made 47 at the Oval as Hampshire reached 222 for seven against Surrey on a rain-truncated day. The weather also intervened at Canterbury where Essex\u2019s Sam Cook and Mohammad Amir, playing the final red-ball game of his career, took three wickets each against Kent. Daniel Bell-Drummond made 50. In Division Two, six of Worcestershire\u2019s top seven batsmen made a grand total of nine, the other, Moeen Ali, playing his first Championship game of the year, made 42. No 10 Joe Leach then hit 53 as the last three wickets dragged Worcester to respectability. Fifties from Alex Wakely and Rob Keogh guided Northamptonshire to within touching distance by the close. At Chester-le-Street Alex Lees stepped into the shoes of Cameron Bancroft with a wonderful 181, his highest score for Durham, to leave Leicestershire struggling. Ryan Higgins took five for 54 against Derbyshire to put high-flying Gloucestershire in control at the County Ground. And at Colwyn Bay, Tom Bailey and Danny Lamb took four wickets each as Glamorgan were bowled out in two sessions. But Lancashire were thwarted at the last by a 10th-wicket partnership of 52. Samit Patel, on loan to Glamorgan for the rest of the season, hit 54. A great day\u2019s cricket round the grounds! I was a bit distracted by Ollie Robinson\u2019s exploits - but what deeds from north to south . Rob Yates, Alex Lees, take a bow, and a special mention for Moeen in his first Championship game of the season. I\u2019m off to catch the Hove chugger - see you for more seagulls and wickets in the morning. Good night! I better concentrate on writing up now - but just to say Yates is still there at Edgbaston- 130 not out, Lees has reached 180 at Chester le Street, and James Vince was caught behind for 47. Son of the Desert ! For some reason I can\u2019t access comments today but thank you for saving me from myself. Things are more comfortable now at Hove. TRJ still charging in, but the sense of a wicket being permanently imminent is starting to drift away. Sussex 50 for three. And little Marnus doing his careful stuff at Lord\u2019s, not that we ever doubted him. Northants swiftly closing on Worcestershire, 110 for two, just 76 behind. Unbeaten forties for Wakely and Keogh. Moeen has bowled four overs for 22. And finally... to Colwyn Bay, where Lancashire are finding no daemons - I tell a lie, Alex Davies has been out to Ruaidhri Smith since I last looked. 64 for one, 193 behind Glamorgan who staggered all the way to 257. The ninth and tenth wicket stands put on 112. I love this ground - great Italian just off the sea-front, wonderful ice-cream parlour on the corner and lots more wind-turbines out at sea. Also, if I remember rightly, the UK\u2019s smallest church, basically a cave, in the sea wall. In Division Two, Derby are creeping, belly to the brambles, towards 200: 185 for nine. Five wickets for Ryan Higgins. And Alex Lees is still there at Durham - 160 glorious runs, with Jack Burnham keeping him company on 49: 287 for three. Meanwhile, Sussex lose another, Finch lbw to Toby Roland Jones for a duck (apologies, I should have said TRJ now seems fine): 15 for 3. Bad news here - Toby Roland-Jones has asked for treatment after pain in his fetlock the ball after dismissing Haines. Sussex 15 for two. In a moment of rare quiet, I\u2019ll try for a quick round-the-grounds scan. At Canterbury Kent are in a spot of bother at 51 for four against Essex, Sam Cook 3 for six. Hampshire 143-4 with James Vince a respectably pretty 35 in an hour an a half. Three wickets for Surrey\u2019s Rikki Clarke. And a hundred for Rob Yates - 114 not out - as Warwickshire reach cruise control against Somerset - 238 for two. Yorkshire have clawed up the hill to glimpse the promised land thanks to 92 from Tattersall and fifty from Tim Bresnan, 213 for nine, Luke Wood 5-51. Phil Salt hit his first ball for four, now caught off his third at mid-wicket. Murtagh the man. Toby Roland-Jones has the ball at the other end. I\u2019m not ruling out this game being into its third innings by the close. Tim Murtagh has the ball at the Sea End.. Is this like forcing you to sit down and look at my holiday snaps, as used to happen in ye olde twentieth century? Middlesex all out for 75 - Will Beer nicked the last wicket in the end. Robinson 11-2-34-8. Not bad for young un! Ah, that\u2019s nice, Ben Brown has now presented him with his county cap. HE\u2019s had to wait quite some time, but never mind... and that\u2019s tea. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 23-2 v Essex. NOT TEA The Oval: Surrey v Hampshire 116-3 (Holland 51). Edgbaston: Warwickshire 200-2 (Rhodes 82, Yates 91 not out) v Somerset. Scarborough: Yorkshire 192-7 (Tattersall 81 not out; Luke Wood 5-50 ) v Nottinghamshire DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 149-7 (Higgins 5-46 ) v Gloucestershire. NOT TEA Chester-le-Street: Durham 254-3 (Alex Lees 147) v Leicestershire Colwyn Bay: Glamorgan 257 (Hemphrey 56, Patel 54, Carey 51) v Lancashire County Ground: Worcestershire 186 (Moeen 42, Leach 53; Hutton 6-57) v Northants. NOT TEA Hove: Sussex v Middlesex 61-9 (Robinson 8-27) . NOT TEA. Tom Haines whips the golden rug from under Ollie Robinson\u2019s feet with a wicket, darn it. Middlesex 50 for 9! Interesting stat for you: 54 percent of Robinson\u2019s wickets last year were lbw or bowled... and as I write that he takes another! Eight for twenty in 8.5 overs and an hour and 18 minutes. Something in the air for Sussex bowlers at the moment... The Ollie Robinson train charges on! Seven wickets and counting! Nothing fancy, just relentlessly on target, again, and again and again .This is now a career best at 7-20. The Clark(e)s are in the wickets at The Oval - two for big Rikki, one for young Jordan. Hampshire 116 for three. And a fifth! 5-19 - which gives him 200 wickets in Championship cricket! And a sixth! while I was watching him through binoculars - so I can describe his broad chest, cocked wrist and the way he put his fingers to his lips when he took the wicket but didn\u2019t see the wicket itself. James Harris caught by Harry Finch. And Middlesex are in a fix. Ollie Robinson is bringing a smile to the ex-players\u2019 day here at Sussex - he\u2019s currently chalked up four for 15, with Middlesex wobbling at 32-4. A fifty for Samit! Six fours, a six and apple crumble. Glamorgan 196-8. A third for Ollie Robinson - who spent last month with the Lions, if somewhat quietly. He\u2019s tall with long arms, and quite a right-arm-heavy action. That\u2019s 43 wickets in the season - 13 of them against Middlesex! Bailey and Lamb carving up Glamorgan at Colwyn Bay, with only Samit (34 not out) left to provide any ballast. 163 for eight. Critchley gone at Derby, as Derby trudge towards 100 in their leaking gumboots: 95-7. And hang on a minute, I missed Alex Lees\u2019 century: 119 not out - his third of the season. Bravo! Worcestershire 186 all out - power to Moeen and Nos 8-11 who hauled the score to semi-respectability from 31-6. A bit of nifty stuff from Jamie Overton, but Somerset need more than increasing the batsmen\u2019s heart-rate. Ah! Another wicket here at Hove - a fantastic catch by Tom Haines at gully and a second wicket in the pantry for Ollie Robinson. Middlesex 16 for two - enter Dawid Malan. The shirts of the four slips are billowing like ships off the Solent. Lovely view through the press box window - I can practically see if they need their fingernails cutting. Sun\u2019s out, pale blue sky, Ollie Robinson has the ball, umpire shouts \u201cplay\u201d, and Sam Robson edges behind to Ben Brown. Middlesex 0/1. Round the grounds, Division Two. Derbyshire 82 for six against resurgent Gloucestershire; Durham 132 for two - Alex Lees just 13 short of a century; Glamorgan can be quite happy with 123-4 against top of the table Lancs, and not just because it is pleasing on the eye and Worcestershire\u2019s tail have rescued them from ignominy - 143-9. Round the grounds, Division One. Hampshire have made a good start at The Oval (39-0), Rhodes and Yates are taking the day away from Somerset at some speed (158-2), it is still raining at Canterbury, and Tattersall and Bressie-lad have put on 77 to pull Yorkshire out of the swamp (115-5). Sussex won the toss and will bowl, but no Chris Jordan unfortunately as he has a knee injury. A perfect ten minutes sitting on a bench on Hove seafront. Some hardy souls swimming in some big breakers - the wind is running in off a long run today. Warm sun, soothing sound of moving shingle, reassuring sight of wind turbines turning far out to sea. Back at the ground in time to discover that play will start at 2.30 and go on a bit longer than usual. I\u2019m just going to try and nip down to the sea and back in time for the start of play. See you in half an hour! DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 11-1 v Essex. Rain stopped play, inspection at 2pm. The Oval: Surrey v Hampshire. Start delayed, play due to start at 1.10. Edgbaston: Warwickshire 103-1(Rhodes 50 not out) v Somerset. Scarborough: Yorkshire 84-5 (Luke Wood 5-28 ) v Nottinghamshire DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 62-5 (Higgins 3-13 ) v Gloucestershire Chester-le-Street: Durham 95-1 (Alex Lees 62) v Leicestershire Colwyn Bay: Glamorgan 94-3 v Lancashire County Ground: Worcestershire 96-7 (Moeen 42, Hutton 5-35) v Northants Hove: Sussex v Middlesex. No play yet today, inspection at 1.30. And in Derby, Josh Shaw gets his firsts wicket after confirming his move from over t\u2019 Pennines and straight on till morning. Derbyshire 59 for four. A little bit of history made at Durham, as Gus Robson scores his first Championship runs for the club. Cameron Steel fell for 24 but Alex Lees still there and flying with the first (and only?!) fifty of the day, after Mo was so cruelly felled by HPG. Labuschagne becomes the first concussion substitute in international cricket. And on that note...Glamorgan are 65 for three with Billy Root and Charlie Hemphrey rebuilding with lunch in mind. Some news for you Mes: Darn it. Moeen gone for 42, having made er... 73 per cent of Worcestershire\u2019s score. 58 for seven. Tom Lace and Leus Du Ploy have put on 20 at The County Ground against Gloucs. Currently 54 for three, a couple of wickets for Higgins. And Durham are batting in a higher place - 63 without a sniff of a wicket. After Sibley\u2019s unfortunate demise just when England might be glancing in his direction, Warwickshire progressing relatively smoothly- 60 for one. Play due to start at The Oval at 1.10. Five wickets too for Luke Wood. Johnny Tattersall showing his teammates how it is done with a swift 22 not out, which is a fingernail away from being what the rest of the team have made altogether. From the other place: and this Brett Hutton has now pocketed five for 19, which isn\u2019t bad for half a morning\u2019s work. Three ducks in Worcesteshire\u2019s 36 for six! Hark - a seagull! Sun out here on the south coast - meanwhile in the real world 14 wickets have fallen round the grounds in the first 45 minutes. And play has been suspended at Canterbury. Befuddled of Hove, not sure if I can keep up with this torrent, nay whirlwind, of wickets. Worcestershire now 16 for four with three for Brett Hutton. Moeen\u2019s still there, at least while I type this. So let\u2019s have a photo: Er Yorkshire. Luke Wood now has four for 11 in three and a half overs. Hangover from the Blast? Worse? Lucky, lucky Notts. And this: Make that three wickets for Luke Wood - Yorkies 11 for three with Kohler-Cadmore too back in the pavilion. Wickets wickets everywhere! At Canterbury, where Zak Crawley has been bowled by Mohammad Amir, and Edgbaston, where Dom Sibley is out for a duck. Derbyshire have lost both openers with five on the board, Selman falls victim to the back-to-fitness Tom Bailey at Colwyn Bay, and at Northants Jack Haynes went for a golden duck which brings in Moeen who has already hit two glorious (I imagine) boundaries. Oh Yorkshire, Scarborough won\u2019t be pleased. Five for two - two wickets for Luke Wood - Adam Lyth and Gary Ballance. And a shout out to Didsbury Women\u2019s Cricket Club, whose 1st and 2nd XIs are both playing finals in Chester today. A great little club with a big heart. Go girls! The rain has stopped here at Hove and the umpires are examining the covers, which would make a sensational water slide. The woppa-moppa is on and things are looking up. Quick round-up: play is also delayed at The Oval and Lord\u2019s! Follow goings-on there with our fantastic OBO team here: Rain, rain, rain... Good morning! And welcome back to the county blog \u2013 for a one-match-only August extravaganza. I\u2019m in Hove, which was possibly a bum choice, as the rain is falling and the covers are on and lots of people in tracksuits are standing around looking meaningfully in the grass. There will be no play before lunch and possibly beyond. Hey, ho \u2013 at least I\u2019ve been given a lunch token for the Tony Greig caf\u00e9! When, if, the game begins, it is a crucial one for both sides. Sussex, who have carried all before them in the Blast, have had a miserable time in the Championship. Middlesex, who hope for a late bid for promotion, are at full strength with a revitalised Toby Roland-Jones and Lord\u2019s honours board man Tim Murtagh. Elsewhere, in Division One the leaders Essex take on Kent in Canterbury. Sam Billings has recovered from his shoulder injury and is due to make his first Championship game of the year. Mohammad Amir will play the final red-ball game of his career Hampshire travel to The Oval where sixth place Surrey will be led by Ben Foakes in the absence of Rory Burns at Lord\u2019s. Sam Curran will start the game, but might not finish if needed by England later in the week; Tom Curran is out for the season. Second-placed Somerset travel to Edgbaston where Dom Sibley and Sam Hain return after missing the last Championship game with the Lions. Poor, poor, Olly Stone is out for the season with a stress fracture. Dom Bess will play for Somerset, with Jack Leach at Lord\u2019s with England. Yorkshire and wooden spoonists Nottinghamshire meet at Scarborough where Chris Nash captains in the absence of Steven Mullaney. David Willey is missing for Yorkshire. In Division Two, third placed Gloucestershire travel to seventh-placed Derby. Josh Shaw is back from a loan spell from Yorkshire ahead of a permanent move next season. Durham and Leicester meet at Chester le Street; and Worcestershire go to flying-high Northants, where lovely Moeen Ali makes his first Championship appearance of the year. And in probably the game of the round, second placed Glamorgan entertain Div 2 Leaders Lancashire at Colwyn Bay. In a surprise move Samit Patel has joined Glamorgan on loan for the rest of the season, Australian Shaun Marsh is also due to make his debut. Tom Bailey may return for Lancashire.",

Eytan Alexander, the managing director of Ukat, said it was not yet clear how big a problem gaming disorder had become. \u201cIt is mainly a problem among a certain age group \u2013 not someone who is 50 years old but children who live in that space. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the extent [of the problem] for children who are playing games in bed on their phones.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think yet we have seen how big a problem this is. We know it is a big problem \u2026 but the consequences have not come out yet. They may do in the next five to 10 years. It\u2019s the same with prescription drugs: we are only now starting to see the consequences of that in a big way.\u201d",

You can\u2019t get on the rolls. And if you get on the rolls you can\u2019t stay. You may not be able to cast your ballot, because they close your precinct or they change the rules. That\u2019s rigging the game.\u201d Voter suppression against African Americans, a constant of US history since Reconstruction, has she said \u201cgone underground. It\u2019s no longer hoses and laws that say you cannot vote, it is this insidious nature that says it\u2019s race neutral, that we\u2019re just putting in these laws in place for everyone, but we know it has a disproportionate effect on the communities that have long been marginalized.\u201d In the 2016 presidential election, the first after eight years under the first black president, black turnout fell for the first time in 20 years. Abrams was asked how she would make sure black voters turned out in 2020. \u201cGood candidates give you a reason to vote but good government makes certain you can cast that vote,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what I take exception to is that we do not have people in government who are living up to their obligations. In fact, they are thwarting the will of the people by denying them access. And that\u2019s just wrong.\u201d Abrams\u2019 announcement this week that she would not run for president gained striking attention for a politician who has not held national office. She also said she was open to being running mate to any Democratic nominee. On ABC, she said: \u201cFor each position that I\u2019ve applied for \u2026 I\u2019ve made certain that it\u2019s the right job and I\u2019m the right person and it\u2019s the right time. And when I looked at this current crop of candidates running for the Democratic nomination, I think they\u2019re extraordinary. \u201cAnd I think voter suppression is an intrinsic problem that is bigger than just Georgia. Georgia was emblematic of it and certainly was a singularity in terms of how grotesque the process was, but we\u2019re not alone. \u201cAnd so for me, the decision not to run for president was one of saying, \u2018Where could I do my best work?\u2019 and that\u2019s making certain that we set up voter protection teams across the country.\u201d Abrams said combating voter suppression was \u201cfundamental to tackling issues\u201d her interviewer cited as more important to Democrats: the economy, gun control, climate crisis and abortion among them. \u201cThe ability to vote is how you tackle climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have climate change legislation simply by wishing it.\u201d In Georgia on Saturday, Abrams said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do through Fair Fight 2020 is we\u2019re going to fight back. But we\u2019re fighting early. We\u2019re doing this now. We\u2019re not waiting until we have a nominee. Because no matter who the Democratic nominee is, they\u2019re going to win Georgia.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m going to use my energies and my very, very loud voice to raise the money we need to train those across the country in our 20 battleground states to make sure Donald Trump and the Senate take a hike, and we put people in place who know what we need to have in the United States of America.\u201d Debate continues about the best kind of candidate to run against Trump next year. Former vice-president Joe Biden leads national polling and surveys of black Democratic voters, ahead of candidates including two African Americans, senators Kamala Harris, of California, and Cory Booker of New Jersey. \u201cVice-President Biden is a known quantity,\u201d Abrams told ABC. \u201cHe\u2019s been a part of the national conversation for decades.\u201d Asked if she was concerned by some of the 76-year-old\u2019s comments and past positions on race, she said: \u201cI think, if you listen to the whole of what Joe Biden says, it is consistent with Democratic values, and always has been. \u201cI think we lose out if we spend so much time focusing on missteps or malapropisms, and not focusing on the content. And, right now, every Democratic candidate, I think, is talking about the right things. And that is protecting America, renewing America, and ensuring that we are restored in our values and in our standing in the world.\u201d Trump, she said, is \u201ca racist\u201d. \u201cBut, more importantly, he does not value Americans, and he does not value humanity. And that should be more disturbing to everyone than the title that we prescribe to him.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The term \u201cProject Fear\u201d must be expunged from the respectable political lexicon. Now that we know the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/18/brexit-leaked-papers-predict-food-shortages-and-port-delays-operation-yellowhammer\" title=\"\">full detail</a> of the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer assumptions about a no-deal Brexit, these two words \u2013 scornfully applied for three years to all warnings about Brexit \u2013 have no meaningful place in the present political emergency.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of scaremongering around,\u201d declared the energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, in dismissive response to the Sunday Times\u2019 reports on the leaked Yellowhammer document. Really? These, after all, are the government\u2019s own assessments, not the panicked assertions of ultra-remainers.</p> \n<p>In the event of a no-deal exit, there are likely to be serious shortages of fuel, food and medicine; disruption at the nation\u2019s ports; civil disorder; increased poverty; and a hard border with Ireland. To be profoundly and vocally concerned about such a prospect is not \u201cscaremongering\u201d, but a basic civic responsibility.</p> \n<p>If you look to the heavens and see a UK-sized breeze block plummeting towards you, it is not \u201calarmism\u201d, or \u2013 as Boris Johnson would put it \u2013 a failure of character and confidence, to try to avert its descent. Only last month, he was insisting that \u201ca lot of negativity about a WTO [no-deal] Brexit has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/02/tory-leadership-latest-news-hustings-boris-johnsons-brexit-plan-could-prove-fatal-to-tory-party-says-former-leader-william-hague-live-news?page=with:block-5d1b46258f088a7392737699\" title=\"\">wildly overdone</a> \u2026The planes will fly, there will be clean drinking water and there will be whey for the Mars bars because where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way.\u201d What fun! Except the joke is wearing very thin.</p> \n<p>Indeed, as the \u201cProject Fear\u201d slur diminishes in impact, it is intriguing to observe the prime minister and his acolytes preparing its successor: the \u201cGreat Betrayal\u201d narrative. In a letter to Philip Hammond and 20 other Tory MPs seeking to thwart no deal, leaked to the Mail on Sunday, Johnson alleges that \u201cit is as plain as a pikestaff that Brussels \u2013 or the EU27 \u2013 will simply not compromise as long as they believe there is the faintest possibility that parliament can block Brexit on 31 October\u201d. In other words: if no deal happens, it will be because the EU saw no need to renegotiate. It will be your fault, Spreadsheet Phil.</p> \n<p>This is spectacularly disingenuous. There are absolutely no signs, coded or otherwise, from the EU27 that, dazzled by Johnson\u2019s brio and joke book, they are ready to strike a new deal in the time remaining before 31 October.</p> \n<p>It is he who insists that this deadline cannot be shifted, \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d. It is he and his fellow Brexiteers who led the charge against Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, making it impossible for the Commons to agree on an alternative. We are in this predicament because of the serial dishonesty, manoeuvring and lust for power of those who insisted that leaving the EU would be easy. This may be what Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s senior adviser, would call an \u201cunhelpful narrative\u201d. But it\u2019s also the truth.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6abb9549-0f30-403e-8f6c-7eff020700ee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qViLF9oNupY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>What matters now is how those who want to prevent a historic disaster respond to the challenge; how imaginative they are prepared to be; and whether they are ready to put nation before party, and the interests of subsequent generations before narrow political advantage. Johnson and Cummings are determined to get the UK out on 31 October \u201cby any means necessary\u201d. Are their disaggregated opponents equally committed?</p> \n<p>The question answers itself. I deplore those who are ready to vandalise the future of this great country just to satisfy an ideological itch. But it is also hard not to be exasperated by the fastidiousness of their opponents \u2013 a squeamishness that is fine in times of relative political calm, but an unaffordable luxury at moments such as these, when the stakes are vertiginously high.</p> \n<p>Let us address the bearded elephant in the room. I think I have made it fairly clear that I do not want Jeremy Corbyn to become prime minister and that I firmly believe he is not up to the job. But \u2013 if Johnson loses a vote of no confidence in September, triggering a 14-day period in which, by law, any MP can seek to form an alternative government \u2013 it is self-evident that Corbyn will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/17/corbyn-labour-no-deal-brexit-mps-flirting-with-disaster\" title=\"\">at the heart</a> of any such discussions, ex officio<em>,</em> as leader of the opposition. I might wish that Stella Creasy or Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn held that post. But none of them does.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e989b9c5-c311-47cb-a7c1-f23fc243e6d3\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <!-- invalid atom id (e989b9c5-c311-47cb-a7c1-f23fc243e6d3) -->\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As it happens, I doubt that Corbyn could cobble together a Commons majority. But it was foolish of the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and Tory opponents of no deal such as Dominic Grieve and Oliver Letwin, to make their opening move <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/aug/15/jo-swinson-says-corbyn-cannot-become-temporary-pm-video\" title=\"\">a veto on the Labour leader</a> heading even an interim government committed to an extension of article 50, an early general election and a fresh referendum. All this grandstanding has been a great morale-booster for the no-deal Brexiteers. Who can blame them? The very first signal sent by their opponents was one of disunity, introspection and petty partisanship.</p> \n<p>Again, to be clear: I think the chances of a so-called government of national unity being formed have always been slim. The better prospects are for parliament to pass fast-tracked legislation to mandate the government to seek an article 50 extension; and a variety of strategies in the courts, especially a judicial review to prevent Johnson postponing a general election until after 31 October.</p> \n<p>That, though, is not the point. As the comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/15/why-i-love-dave-chappelle-bim-adewunmi\" title=\"\">Dave Chappelle</a> has put it, progress always, inevitably, depends upon a readiness to work with imperfect allies. Those who claim they are committed \u2013 really committed \u2013 to preventing the outrage of a no-deal exit have yet to prove that they are prepared to do whatever it takes. And time, to put it mildly, is running out.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The term \u201cProject Fear\u201d must be expunged from the respectable political lexicon. Now that we know the full detail of the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer assumptions about a no-deal Brexit, these two words \u2013 scornfully applied for three years to all warnings about Brexit \u2013 have no meaningful place in the present political emergency. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of scaremongering around,\u201d declared the energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, in dismissive response to the Sunday Times\u2019 reports on the leaked Yellowhammer document. Really? These, after all, are the government\u2019s own assessments, not the panicked assertions of ultra-remainers. In the event of a no-deal exit, there are likely to be serious shortages of fuel, food and medicine; disruption at the nation\u2019s ports; civil disorder; increased poverty; and a hard border with Ireland. To be profoundly and vocally concerned about such a prospect is not \u201cscaremongering\u201d, but a basic civic responsibility. If you look to the heavens and see a UK-sized breeze block plummeting towards you, it is not \u201calarmism\u201d, or \u2013 as Boris Johnson would put it \u2013 a failure of character and confidence, to try to avert its descent. Only last month, he was insisting that \u201ca lot of negativity about a WTO [no-deal] Brexit has been wildly overdone \u2026The planes will fly, there will be clean drinking water and there will be whey for the Mars bars because where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way.\u201d What fun! Except the joke is wearing very thin. Indeed, as the \u201cProject Fear\u201d slur diminishes in impact, it is intriguing to observe the prime minister and his acolytes preparing its successor: the \u201cGreat Betrayal\u201d narrative. In a letter to Philip Hammond and 20 other Tory MPs seeking to thwart no deal, leaked to the Mail on Sunday, Johnson alleges that \u201cit is as plain as a pikestaff that Brussels \u2013 or the EU27 \u2013 will simply not compromise as long as they believe there is the faintest possibility that parliament can block Brexit on 31 October\u201d. In other words: if no deal happens, it will be because the EU saw no need to renegotiate. It will be your fault, Spreadsheet Phil. This is spectacularly disingenuous. There are absolutely no signs, coded or otherwise, from the EU27 that, dazzled by Johnson\u2019s brio and joke book, they are ready to strike a new deal in the time remaining before 31 October. It is he who insists that this deadline cannot be shifted, \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d. It is he and his fellow Brexiteers who led the charge against Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, making it impossible for the Commons to agree on an alternative. We are in this predicament because of the serial dishonesty, manoeuvring and lust for power of those who insisted that leaving the EU would be easy. This may be what Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s senior adviser, would call an \u201cunhelpful narrative\u201d. But it\u2019s also the truth. What matters now is how those who want to prevent a historic disaster respond to the challenge; how imaginative they are prepared to be; and whether they are ready to put nation before party, and the interests of subsequent generations before narrow political advantage. Johnson and Cummings are determined to get the UK out on 31 October \u201cby any means necessary\u201d. Are their disaggregated opponents equally committed? The question answers itself. I deplore those who are ready to vandalise the future of this great country just to satisfy an ideological itch. But it is also hard not to be exasperated by the fastidiousness of their opponents \u2013 a squeamishness that is fine in times of relative political calm, but an unaffordable luxury at moments such as these, when the stakes are vertiginously high. Let us address the bearded elephant in the room. I think I have made it fairly clear that I do not want Jeremy Corbyn to become prime minister and that I firmly believe he is not up to the job. But \u2013 if Johnson loses a vote of no confidence in September, triggering a 14-day period in which, by law, any MP can seek to form an alternative government \u2013 it is self-evident that Corbyn will be at the heart of any such discussions, ex officio, as leader of the opposition. I might wish that Stella Creasy or Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn held that post. But none of them does. As it happens, I doubt that Corbyn could cobble together a Commons majority. But it was foolish of the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and Tory opponents of no deal such as Dominic Grieve and Oliver Letwin, to make their opening move a veto on the Labour leader heading even an interim government committed to an extension of article 50, an early general election and a fresh referendum. All this grandstanding has been a great morale-booster for the no-deal Brexiteers. Who can blame them? The very first signal sent by their opponents was one of disunity, introspection and petty partisanship. Again, to be clear: I think the chances of a so-called government of national unity being formed have always been slim. The better prospects are for parliament to pass fast-tracked legislation to mandate the government to seek an article 50 extension; and a variety of strategies in the courts, especially a judicial review to prevent Johnson postponing a general election until after 31 October. That, though, is not the point. As the comedian Dave Chappelle has put it, progress always, inevitably, depends upon a readiness to work with imperfect allies. Those who claim they are committed \u2013 really committed \u2013 to preventing the outrage of a no-deal exit have yet to prove that they are prepared to do whatever it takes. And time, to put it mildly, is running out. \u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona is a Guardian columnist",

Most of the time, the 90 minutes are a disappointment, and we don\u2019t keep coming back on the off-chance that this time they won\u2019t be. </p> <p>As such, how well a team does or doesn\u2019t do isn\u2019t the most important thing about it, so to chunter about Sheffield United finally being back in the Premier League is to ignore the multitude of other things going on, both at Bramall Lane and elsewhere. Except Sheffield United being back in the Premier League is a huge deal, and today is a huge fixture. </p> <p>Like most promoted sides, their principal goal is to avoid relegation, and Billy Sharp\u2019s late equaliser last weekend earned them a crucial point in that regard. Now, this week, they have a home fixture which comes with its own cliche: \u201cThe kind of game you have to win if you want to stay up\u201d. </p> <p>They\u2019ve a decent chance of doing it. Chris Wilder clearly knows something, and because he has kept faith with the players who achieved promotion, his team are grooved and confident. They know what they\u2019re doing, and trust themselves to pull it off effectively. </p> <p>Palace, meanwhile, look a little wobbly. Though they opened the season with a creditable goalless draw against Everton, over the summer they lost Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Wilfried Zaha, their two best players, physically and spiritually respectively \u2013 so need to find a quick solution. </p> <p>Chances are, Zaha will quickly revert to his old self, but Roy Hodgson\u2019s back four has the aroma of Nationwide, and it seems unlikely that Luka Milivojevic, last season\u2019s top scorer, might again be afforded the 10 penalties which made that happen. Defeat today will say very bad things about their prospects.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 2pm BST</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"518108d6b7a657ac6d5cc5f69c2133ed095a5233\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/518108d6b7a657ac6d5cc5f69c2133ed095a5233/0_0_1780_1464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Smith gets past Palace\u2019s Dean Austin and Andy Linighan during a Division One encounter in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"822\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Smith gets past Palace\u2019s Dean Austin and Andy Linighan during a Division One encounter in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Mason/Allsport</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-18T11:29:43.137Z\">at 12.29pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "But why not spend the rest of your afternoon with Rob Smyth? Otherwise, thanks all for your company and comments \u2013 ta-ra. Right, here\u2019s Louise Taylor\u2019s match report - dig in. I\u2019m trying to conjure up a way Palace don\u2019t struggle this season, but I\u2019ve no idea what it is. Maybe they move Meyer to number 10 and try Zaha out wide? I\u2019ve not a clue what they do with their defence. Jamie Redknapp just used the phrase \u201coverlapping centre-backs\u201d. Only the second game of the season and it\u2019s already a cliche. When you say a team are well organised, you usually mean that they defend doughtily, and that\u2019s certainly true of United. But they also have attacking plans, and several of them - they intend to score and know how they\u2019re going to go about it. There\u2019s a long way to go, but that was very impressive \u2013 Chris Wilder knows something. Palace, on the other hand, are a rabble. It\u2019s going to be a long and unpleasant season for them if they can\u2019t somehow make their older players younger and their worse players better. That\u2019s a fine win and performance from Blades, who worked harder than Palace at the same time as having a better plan and greater quality. If they can keep their better players fit, and if McBurnie and Freeman settle in, they can stay up. 90+7 min Kelly lofts a ball into touch, and that\u2019s got to be it! 90+7 min I should probably say, and excuse me for failing to mention it sooner, but Palace are absolutely abject. 90+6 min Ward moves the ball out to Van Aanholt, who crosses towards Schlupp and for a second it looks like there\u2019s space on the edge of the box, so 629 defenders quickly fill it with bodies and heads. 90+4 min Zaha drops deep to seek the ball and Stevens drops deep with him to administer a kick. 90+4 min United have made this time disappear pretty easily, and the busy McBurnie then wins his team a corner. They\u2019re nearly there. 90+2 min Palace win a free-kick out on the left and Milivojevic clips in, but the ball is headed away easily enough. 90 min There\u2019ll be seven added minutes: well done referee. 90 min I probably should\u2019ve said earlier: Palace have been absolutely steaming. 89 min Have a look! Phil Jagielka is sent on by Chris Wilder, replacing McGoldrick. I guess United are playing four centre-backs now, overlapping or otherwise. 88 min Zaha gets the ball and is immediately surrounded by 72 defenders. He\u2019s quickly unloaded. 88 min \u201cIf the officials add on the true amount of wasted time, this game could have another 90 minutes,\u201d calculates Peter Littley. Tell you what, instead of farting about with VAR, this is an area that could easily be addressed and would actually improve the flow of the game. Two halves of 30 minutes duration, if the ball goes out of play the watch stops. 86 min McBurnie pursues a bouncing ball with his phizog and Ward hoists a foot to take it away from him; there\u2019s a little bit of contact but either way, that\u2019s an infringement \u201cfor me\u201d and a free-kick right on the edge of the box. The ref, though, thinks otherwise. 85 min Freeman, who doesn\u2019t wait to be asked, comes sliding in like a meshuggener and clips McCarthy. He\u2019s booked, which is the right call, but worth noting that his foot was higher than the son. 83 min Schlupp contrives to handle a bouncing ball 25 yards from his own goal, level with the right edge of the box, and Norwood curls in a decent enough ball ... but McBurnie needs to contort to get to it, sending his header wide. He\u2019s shown enough since coming on to suggest he\u2019ll keep his place too. 82 min Final shot at the dart for Hodgson: Wickham replaces McArthur. If they can get enough of the ball, they should send him and Benteke to the front post and see what happens when the crosses come in. 81 min And still Palace struggle to find tempo and rhythm. It\u2019s not clear how they planned to win today, because they\u2019ve done so little. 79 min Freeman has been excellent since coming on - I daresay he may keep his place - and he wins a corner, which Norwood sends into the middle. McBurnie is up first too, peeling away, and he heads into Schlupp and over; the ref signals a goalkick, which is ill-received by yerman. 78 min Lovely from United, Stevens into O\u2019Connell, who backheels for McGoldrick. He wins a throw, and Palace lose more valuable seconds. 77 min Palace are an absolute piece ay nonsense. 75 min Palace try some quick passing, so O\u2019Connell rams in the back of McCarthy. That\u2019ll learn them. 73 min Minor handbags when Baldock charges through McCarthy and catches foot with studs; he\u2019s booked, and so is McCarthy for daring to remonstrate. Er, that seems fair, 72 min Guaita claws Norwood\u2019s corner clear but Basham picks it up and clips to the back post, where O\u2019Connell, his left-centre-back partner waits. He climbs more or less unopposed, but can only head wide. 71 min Stevens throws to McBurnie, whose hold-up wins a corner. United look far more likely to score a second than Palace do to find an equaliser. 70 min Another change for Palace: off goes Townsend and on comes McCarthy, making his debut for the club. Admit it, you thought he always played for them didn\u2019t you. 68 min Ahahahahah! Lovely from Stevens, rotating through a double-Zidane which takes him between three men; he then tries to flick a crossfield pass out right with the outside of his boot, but can\u2019t quite force it over the man blocking its route. 67 min Norwood whips in and Dann heads clear. 66 min The thing about these overlapping centre-backs \u2013 as Milivojevic pulls down Basham on the right win - is that it\u2019s not just about getting them forward, but about them having the ability to do something when they get there. Free-kick United... 65 min Change for Palace: Schlupp, fit again, replaces Meyer, who we see for the first time this afternoon when he runs off. 64 min The game resumed and Townsend, forced to depart, quickly runs back on. 62 min Freeman, who\u2019s done well since coming on, runs through a challenge with Townsend and leaves without the ball, but bringing his heels high, clips his man\u2019s eye with a stud. There\u2019s a break while he\u2019s treated. 61 min United are still by far the better side, faster to every ball and passing with greater purpose and imagination. 60 min \u201cOK Daniel,\u201d retorts Richard Harris, or Cuz as I call him. \u201cI see where you are going with this \u2013 Sheffield United v West Ham is going to be the new Palace v Brighton pseudo-derby as the Owls are stuck in the Championship and the Steel City derby won\u2019t be played again until next season.\u201d Incidentally, when did \u201cSteel City derby\u201d become a thing. Was it when \u201cSecond City derby\u201d did too/ Otherwise, I admire your need to needle. 58 min There\u2019s time still to go, but I\u2019d be extremely concerned if I was a Palace fan, or a Jerk-loving fan of any other Premier League club. This is desperate from them, not just in terms of quality but intensity too. 56 min McBurnie replaces Robinson. 55 min Robinson is down having his left knee seen to which, by the looks of things, will get us a look at McBurnie; he\u2019s stripped and ready to go. 54 min Zaha tricks his way past a foul or two on the left, seeking to inject some urgency, but eventually, crowded out, slices a shot wide. 52 min Lundstram has now scored in all four divisions of the league \u2013 what a great stat that is. And what a great advert this performance is for the standard outside the top one. 51 min As for United, they can either sit on their lead or seek another; I think we know which option they\u2019ll choose, eh? 49 min Palace needed to up it before, but now they\u2019re a goal down and the crowd are on a buzz, can they find something? The overlapping centre-back does it again! O\u2019Connell glides down the left like a fairy elephant and moves the ball inside to Stevens, who finds Freeman with a lovely twizzle around the corner, back outside. His pass across the face is a clever one, so though it fails to find Robinson, it forces Guaita to dive and shove out ... directly into the path of Lundstram, who steadies himself before snapping home the opener, and don\u2019t Blades deserve it! 47 min I didn\u2019t see loads of United last term, but I\u2019m impressed with how confidently they move the ball in and out of the back. 46 min So have Palace changed anything? They need to get Zaha on the ball - perhaps he should have a jaunt out wide - and get some crosses into Benteke. 46 min We go again! Half-time entertainment... United had by far the better of that and missed as gaping a chance as they could possibly have wished for. They\u2019ll need to step it up in the second half, because Palace can\u2019t be as docile again. 45+2 min I wonder if Palace will change anything at half-time, because they\u2019re creating very little and threatening ever less. 45 min There\u2019ll be three added minutes. 43 min It\u2019s hard to see United creating a better chance than that, but on the other hand they now know that they can create one as good as that. It really was a lovely cross too, snaking a line of best fit; Baldock has looked a threat all afternoon, and getting him the ball should be a principal plan. 42 min WHAT A MISS! Mal Aanholtini classily brings the ball away, except Baldock robs him, exchanges passes with Robinson, and arcs a glorious between keeper and defence; at the far post, McGoldrick can\u2019t miss! All he has to do is tap home ... except he somehow shins clinically into Guaita\u2019s midriff! Dearie him! 42 min I was looking forward to seeing Meyer today, but he\u2019s barely had a kick. 40 min Bit of possession for Palace, who get it into Benteke on the edge of the box, but Zaha is on his heels when the poke-back comes and United clear away. 38 min Norwood and Lundstram out-battle Milivojevic and the ball breaks to Freeman, who leathers a first-time shot ... into the nearest defender. 37 min Freeman\u2019s made a good start here - he\u2019s always looking to move the ball forward, and quickly. 36 min Milivojevic looks mean as he takes command of the situation, then drives the ball straight into the wall like he intended that all along. 35 min Egan goes in late on Townsend, giving Palace a free-kick 25 yards from goal, right of centre... 32 min Lovely from Freeman, drilling a luscious ball over the top for Robinson. He can smell the defender behind him, so takes a swipe and fails to connect properly, but that switch of play was very nice. 32 min Of course, the worry for United is if Zaha does something brilliant, and for a second he looks to have isolated Basham, who sees him away pretty well. 30 min United knock it about at the back for a bit, like 80s Liverpool with a 1-0 lead and George Courtney refereeing. They look really composed, but and the likelier of the two teams \u2013 they seem to have more ideas as to how they might score, even if they don\u2019t much like they will score. 28 min Fleck is down with what looks like cramp, but it can\u2019t be. He accepts treatment then slowly walks off \u2013 it\u2019s his knee, I reckon \u2013 and Luke Freeman, newly arrived from QPR, replaces him. 26 min United try the old Anderton-Sheringham corner, clipped to a man in line with the near post \u2013 I think it\u2019s O\u2019Connell \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t get hold of his shot, which is kicked clear. 25 min Blades are coming! McGoldrick puls right and lays off to Baldock, who swings over another nice cross; it\u2019s nodded clear, then Norwood smashes a shot into some nearby shins and the ball flies over. 23 min Stevens lashes a shot goalwards and it hits Joel Ward on an arm that\u2019s folded tight to his body; the ref says no pen and so do the others refs. \u201cV-A-R! V-A-R!\u201d chant the crowd. I expletive despair. 22 min Palace win another corner, which Milivojevic drills to the bear post; it looks dangerous, but it\u2019s well cleared by Baldock (I think). 20 min Zaha wins a corner down the left, which Milivojevic takes ... and Henderson flies out his goal to punch clear. He does not lack for confidence and will, I think, develop into a serious keeper. 19 min \u201cNot sure how long you\u2019ve been nursing that one or why it has any relevance to a game between the Blades and Palace,\u201d emails Richard Harris, \u201cbut I think the main beef was about West Ham having two players \u2013 Tevez and Mascherano \u2013 who had third party owners and shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to play. Tevez scored the winner against the supposedly weakened United didn\u2019t he?\u201d Yes, there was also complaining about that, Cuz. I know exactly how long I\u2019ve been nursing it because I know exactly when it happened \u2013 13 May 2007 \u2013 and the reason it\u2019s relevant now is that it was the last time Blades played a game in the top division. 18 min United are neat and tidy in possession, but might perhaps move it a little quicker - perhaps they will as they settle. 16 min Zaha gets away down the left, but a heavy touch sees him run straight into Basham, who clears. There\u2019s a lot of toil here, but not so much of anything else. 14 min Palace knock it about briefly but United are onto them quickly. You can tell by the runs they make how settled they are - the question is whether they can find the necessary quality to survive. 12 min Ward gets himself down the right, linking up with Townsend before larruping a cross over the bar. 10 min The cross goes to the back post, where Egan heads wide. 10 min Baldock gets down the right and cuts inside, curling in a decent cross which Kelly nuts behind. 8 min Lundstram is late on Zaha, so is booked. 7 min I\u2019d like to get something off my chest: last time Sheffield United were in the Premier League, Neil Warnock chastised Alex Ferguson for picking a weakened team for Manchester United\u2019s final game of the season, which they lost to West Ham, sending the Blades down. United were already league champions and had the FA Cup final to come, but that side was: Van der Sar, O\u2019Shea, Brown, Heinze, Evra (Giggs 57), Solskjaer, Carrick (Scholes 58), Fletcher, Richardson, Smith (Ronaldo 58), Rooney. Meanwhile, when Warnock\u2019s team came to Old Trafford in the league, he picked an under-strength side on the basis that their first XI would likely lose anyway. 5 min Zaha leaps to flick on and O\u2019Connell, perhaps still groggy, allows the ball across his body; Benteke nips onto it and drives low towards the near post, where Henderson saves. 5 min Nice from Norwood, who breaks up a Palace attack and strides forward ... until McArthur hauls him down. 3 min O\u2019Connell feels the blunt side of Benteke\u2019s head, which he nuts with respectable force. There\u2019s a recess while he receives treatment. 2 min There\u2019s a decent row in the ground, but that Allez Allez Allez song, currently getting an airing, is one of the worst I\u2019ve ever heard. Whatever happened to originality? 1 min Right away, United press high and McGoldrick wins a throw deep inside the Palace half. They get it away, but that was a statement of intent from the home side. 1 min Off we go! Chris Wilder is wearing a gilet. Game\u2019s gone. Ashley Cole just used the word \u201ctumped\u201d on live TV. We are back in good old 1995! Here they come! Is Tasty Jerk, next door to Slehurst Park, the greatest football eating place? Shout also to the Vine, near the Hawthorns. It\u2019s warming up at Bramall Lane, and the players are tunnelled... \u201cI think there will be many more penalties in the coming season, not just because of VAR, but also because of the rule changes,\u201d says Jon. \u201cSome forwards will deliberately start kicking the ball at any loose defender hands and arms in the area. VAR will also cause minor fouls off the ball to be punished, such as Bayern\u2019s penalty yesterday.\u201d Yes, agreed \u2013 though isn\u2019t the rule change because of VAR? As far as the second element goes, I\u2019d change the penalty law entirely: if an infringement denies a goalscoring opportunity anywhere on the pitch, penalty; in an infringement in the box doesn\u2019t deny a goalscoring opportunity, direct free-kick. Graeme Souness loves Zaha. I wonder how the rest of his career will pan out \u2013 he has the talent to play in the Champions League, but Palace can afford to price him out of moves. That\u2019s got to be annoying, but on the plus side, he\u2019s still handy for Tasty Jerk. Roy Hodgson says Wilfried Zaha has trained well and that his team need to match United for heart and aggression while remaining calm. He\u2019s looking forward to the atmosphere. He also says that you need to get bodies out wide to counter United\u2019s overlapping centre-backs \u2013 how they combat the inherent problems with the 3-5-2- formation \u2013 and that they can\u2019t be in two places at once, which leaves them vulnerable to the counter. Brian Deane is wearing a light brown three-piece suit \u2013 from Burton or River Island, I trust. It\u2019s like the 90s never ended. Sky\u2019s interviewer just asked Chris Wilder where his head was at. Naturally, he responded with \u201cGOT A TEXT!\u201d so she told him to \u201cstop being so muggy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking there might actually be more penalties this season,\u201d emails Patrick Cullen, \u201cdue to the use of VAR. Can I take it you disagree, or will Palace be using a different penalty taker?\u201d That\u2019s a good point. I\u2019m sure Palace will be sticking with their man, but perhaps he might do as well for the reason you give. And I say that as someone who doesn\u2019t like 3-5-2 on the basis that you can\u2019t just forget about the corners of the pitch if you want to be good. But if you want to make it difficult, that\u2019s a different thing. A hypothesis: for a team seeking to survive, 3-5-2 is the best formation. They don\u2019t get outnumbered in midfield, they\u2019ve got two strikers to take advantage of any attacking aggro they can cause, and the men to defend the box. If a team is good enough to go around the sides and between wing-back and centre-back, so be it. Funnily enough, the Shamen perpetrated one of my linguistic hates, in Ebeneezer Goode. This verse is an absolute bazzer ... except for the bit where \u201cmischievous\u201d becomes \u201cmischievious\u201d. \u201cYou can see that he\u2019s mischievous, mysterious and devious When he circulates amongst the people in the place But once you know he\u2019s fun, and something of a genius He gives a grin that goes around from face to face to face Backwards and then forwards, forwards and then backwards \u2018Eezer is the geezer who loves to muscle in That\u2019s about the time the crowd all shout the name of \u2018Eezer As he\u2019s kotcheled in the corner, laughing by the bass bin.\u201d \u201cAre we to expect The Shamen and the Sky Strikers at half-time,\u201d wonders Gary Naylor. Mr C is busy, so I believe they\u2019ve hired Marcus Brigstocke. Sky have just shown some of this little ripper (yes, caveats, but a ripper nonetheless). Simple enough teams, then: United are unchanged, while Palace bring back Zaha, who replaces Ayew. Sheffield United (an unarguable 3-5-2): Henderson; Basham, Egan, O\u2019Connell; Baldock, Lundstram, Norwood, Fleck, Stevens; McGoldrick, Robinson. Subs: Moore, Jagielka, Osborn, Besic, Sharp, McBurnie, Freeman. Crystal Palace (a Paulo Coelho-influenced 4-4-2): Guaita; Ward, Kelly, Dann, Van Aanholt; Townsend, McArthur, Milijoevic, Meyer; Benteke, Zaha. Subs: Hennessey, Cahill, Schlupp, McCarthy, Kouyate, Wickham, Ayew. Football is about so many things beyond football that to bang on about football sometimes feels gauche. Most of the time, the 90 minutes are a disappointment, and we don\u2019t keep coming back on the off-chance that this time they won\u2019t be. As such, how well a team does or doesn\u2019t do isn\u2019t the most important thing about it, so to chunter about Sheffield United finally being back in the Premier League is to ignore the multitude of other things going on, both at Bramall Lane and elsewhere. Except Sheffield United being back in the Premier League is a huge deal, and today is a huge fixture. Like most promoted sides, their principal goal is to avoid relegation, and Billy Sharp\u2019s late equaliser last weekend earned them a crucial point in that regard. Now, this week, they have a home fixture which comes with its own cliche: \u201cThe kind of game you have to win if you want to stay up\u201d. They\u2019ve a decent chance of doing it. Chris Wilder clearly knows something, and because he has kept faith with the players who achieved promotion, his team are grooved and confident. They know what they\u2019re doing, and trust themselves to pull it off effectively. Palace, meanwhile, look a little wobbly. Though they opened the season with a creditable goalless draw against Everton, over the summer they lost Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Wilfried Zaha, their two best players, physically and spiritually respectively \u2013 so need to find a quick solution. Chances are, Zaha will quickly revert to his old self, but Roy Hodgson\u2019s back four has the aroma of Nationwide, and it seems unlikely that Luka Milivojevic, last season\u2019s top scorer, might again be afforded the 10 penalties which made that happen. Defeat today will say very bad things about their prospects. Kick-off: 2pm BST",

      "bodyText": "The smell of fresh paint and the warmth of the August sun hinted at exciting new beginnings but there was also a lot that seemed reassuringly familiar about Sheffield United as they hosted Premier League football for the first time in 12 years. While Bramall Lane enjoyed a \u00a35m summer makeover, Chris Wilder kept faith with the philosophy which won his Blades two promotions in the last three seasons and furnished him with the best recent win percentage of any manager in England. Such consistency left Roy Hodgson\u2019s visitors bamboozled by Wilder\u2019s now famous overlapping centre-halves as England\u2019s manager looked on admiringly, Crystal Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha floundered alarmingly and John Lundstram\u2019s deserved winner was cheered to the rafters. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to discuss individual players\u2019 performances,\u201d said a disappointed Hodgson when quizzed about Zaha. \u201cWe weren\u2019t good enough.\u201d Not surprisingly, his United counterpart proved considerably more upbeat. \u201cPalace are very good away but we didn\u2019t allow their main players into the game,\u201d said Wilder. \u201cWe kept our shape and got the balance between attacking and defending right.\u201d Gareth Southgate was in attendance, equipped with notebook and pen. Maybe England\u2019s coach had come to closely examine the Premier League\u2019s latest tactical innovation, those overlapping centre-halves? Or perhaps a Sheffield United starting XI consisting solely of British and Irish players was the principal draw?

Admittedly it did not happen as often as last season \u2013 Hodgson correctly pointed out that \u201cwe limited that tactic\u201d \u2013 but, tellingly, this party trick still featured in the preamble to Lundstram\u2019s goal. Back in his own days at centre-half, Southgate \u2013 once a Palace player \u2013 would probably have been rather good at interpreting that overlapping role in typically elegant, measured fashion but this system does leave a lot of responsibility resting with the sitting defender who stays back and holds things together while others advance. John Egan fulfils that role for Wilder and, from it, the Ireland international read the game very well, frequently second guessing the attacking manoeuvres conjured by Christian Benteke, Zaha and friends. It is not so long ago that Egan\u2019s career seemed over when he was released by Sunderland after a horrific leg break sustained during a loan stint at Bradford so it was heartening to see him at the nerve centre of a formation which caused Hodgson considerable technical area consternation. Hats off, too, to Oliver Norwood who excelled in the centre of Wilder\u2019s midfield, the home captain playing a significant part in Palace\u2019s travails on a day when the unsettled Zaha\u2019s heart did not seem to be in it and his teammates exhibited the sort of collective sluggishness which does not bode at all well for the potential relegation battle ahead. Indeed, with Baldock proving a man-of-the-match contender \u2013 and surely catching Southgate\u2019s eye \u2013 after containing Zaha so superbly, the impressively sharp Blades were collectively, and consistently half a yard quicker than their guests. In theory, Zaha, Andros Townsend and company should have been able to pick their hosts off on the counterattack but Egan persistently subdued Benteke and Palace appeared increasingly confused by Wilder\u2019s backline\u2019s habit of countering attacks by morphing into a back four.

Guaita did make one very important intervention late in the first half, though. When Van Aanholt lost possession in typically slapdash fashion, Lundstram delivered a dangerous cross which appeared to be dropping perfectly for David McGoldrick to finish.

The second half had barely begun before Lundstram showed McGoldrick precisely how to polish off a chance, lashing his shot into the net after Guaita had palmed Luke Freeman\u2019s drive into the midfielder\u2019s path. Unerring as Lundstram\u2019s finish was, Freeman deserves immense credit for skipping effortlessly past his marker at the end of a move initiated by one of those overlapping centre-halves \u2013 the left-sided Jack O\u2019Connell this time. As admiring eyes turned towards Wilder \u2013 dressed down for the occasion in a steel grey gilet \u2013 and Palace went increasingly, despairingly, direct, Hodgson wore a look of utter bewilderment.

Though the UK has licensed at least \u00a34.7bn of exports to Saudi Arabia since the country became embroiled in the war in Yemen, the UN documentation demonstrates that British technology has been deployed in a conflict where the Saudi-led coalition has been repeatedly accused of indiscriminate bombing.

      "body": "<p>We are witnessing the beginning of act two in the drama of Italian populism, and it is a showdown between the protagonists who made phase one happen. Since the election of 2018, Matteo Salvini\u2019s League has grown stronger, and it has had enough of its coalition partner, the Five Star Movement. It now feels it can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/17/back-me-stop-salvini-renzi-casts-himself-italy-saviour\" title=\"\">claim sole leadership</a> of the country, with Salvini as prime minister.</p> <p>It\u2019s a development that Steve Bannon, the theoretician of the US populist wave that elected Trump in 2016, foresaw. The day after the coalition was formed, Bannon said of Salvini and the Five Star leader, Luigi Di Maio: \u201cThey will govern together, but Salvini is the real leader, because Di Maio resembles [Emmanuel] Macron.\u201d This was always a tactical alliance, because in the end populism is based on there being only one leader.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s coming will be aggressive and confrontational. Act two of Italian populism will put up a tough fight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Act one of this new Italian political phenomenon \u2013 last year\u2019s game-changing general election \u2013 testified to a solid populist majority among the electorate. But the coalition that resulted highlighted the deep differences between the allies. The European elections of 26 May, in which the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/matteo-salvini-far-right-league-party-tops-italy-eu-election-polls\" title=\"\">League won</a> twice as many seats in the European parliament as the Five Star Movement, signalled to Salvini that the time was finally right to trigger act two. The League\u2019s motion of no confidence in the current prime minister, the lawyer Giuseppe Conte, is designed to test whether the project can be pulled off or not. On Tuesday, in a moment of truth, Conte will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/italian-pm-summoned-to-face-possible-no-confidence-vote\" title=\"\">face Italian MPs over the crisis</a>.</p> <p>This is about the re-making of Italian populism in the image of the aggressive nationalism of the League. The Five Star Movement, which has been more ambiguous in its political positioning, is increasingly seen as a collection of losers.</p> <p>What we are seeing is essentially a revolt of the Italian middle classes. It started out as a protest against inequality, migrants and corruption; it has grown in strength by generating conflicts and new enemies, and it craves a strong leader rather than a complicated, amorphous alliance.</p> <p>The nationalism of the League involves closing ports to migrants; planning to impose fines of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/06/italy-fine-migrant-rescue-boats-1-million-tough-salvini-law/\" title=\"\">up to </a><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/06/italy-fine-migrant-rescue-boats-1-million-tough-salvini-law/\" title=\"\">\u20ac1m</a> on anyone assisting a refugee at sea; voting in Strasbourg against the new president of the European commission and aiming to make the next budget a platform for openly challenging Europe over its fiscal rules. With Salvini at the helm, it all plays out in a public performance featuring crucifixes, beach orations, the vocabulary of football ultras and a tribal exaltation of ethnic-nationalist identity. The hostility to migrants and the duel with Europe are the two pillars around which Salvini garners votes, making mincemeat of the Five Star Movement, which is banking on a policy of offering a basic income to \u201cdefeat poverty\u201d. That was too vague an objective to ever be credible.</p> <p>Now Salvini is getting ready to pounce on his former allies. In order to see him off, the Five Star Movement would have had to transform itself into a credible force for government and a guarantor of stability. It would have had to move on from protest to the art of governing.</p> <p>The reason it wasn\u2019t able to is because it was wedded to an anti-growth ideology, which led it to commit a series of errors. It was a mistake to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/21/virginia-raggi-mayor-of-rome-announces-opposition-city-olympic-bid\" title=\"\">oppose Rome\u2019s nomination</a> for the 2024 Olympics and Turin\u2019s for the 2026 Winter Games. It was a mistake to oppose a high-speed train link between France and Italy, a new motorway in the north of Italy, and a project to drill for oil in territorial waters off the coast.

      "bodyText": "We are witnessing the beginning of act two in the drama of Italian populism, and it is a showdown between the protagonists who made phase one happen. Since the election of 2018, Matteo Salvini\u2019s League has grown stronger, and it has had enough of its coalition partner, the Five Star Movement. It now feels it can claim sole leadership of the country, with Salvini as prime minister. It\u2019s a development that Steve Bannon, the theoretician of the US populist wave that elected Trump in 2016, foresaw. The day after the coalition was formed, Bannon said of Salvini and the Five Star leader, Luigi Di Maio: \u201cThey will govern together, but Salvini is the real leader, because Di Maio resembles [Emmanuel] Macron.\u201d This was always a tactical alliance, because in the end populism is based on there being only one leader. Act one of this new Italian political phenomenon \u2013 last year\u2019s game-changing general election \u2013 testified to a solid populist majority among the electorate. But the coalition that resulted highlighted the deep differences between the allies. The European elections of 26 May, in which the League won twice as many seats in the European parliament as the Five Star Movement, signalled to Salvini that the time was finally right to trigger act two. The League\u2019s motion of no confidence in the current prime minister, the lawyer Giuseppe Conte, is designed to test whether the project can be pulled off or not. On Tuesday, in a moment of truth, Conte will face Italian MPs over the crisis. This is about the re-making of Italian populism in the image of the aggressive nationalism of the League. The Five Star Movement, which has been more ambiguous in its political positioning, is increasingly seen as a collection of losers. What we are seeing is essentially a revolt of the Italian middle classes. It started out as a protest against inequality, migrants and corruption; it has grown in strength by generating conflicts and new enemies, and it craves a strong leader rather than a complicated, amorphous alliance. The nationalism of the League involves closing ports to migrants; planning to impose fines of up to \u20ac1m on anyone assisting a refugee at sea; voting in Strasbourg against the new president of the European commission and aiming to make the next budget a platform for openly challenging Europe over its fiscal rules. With Salvini at the helm, it all plays out in a public performance featuring crucifixes, beach orations, the vocabulary of football ultras and a tribal exaltation of ethnic-nationalist identity. The hostility to migrants and the duel with Europe are the two pillars around which Salvini garners votes, making mincemeat of the Five Star Movement, which is banking on a policy of offering a basic income to \u201cdefeat poverty\u201d. That was too vague an objective to ever be credible. Now Salvini is getting ready to pounce on his former allies. In order to see him off, the Five Star Movement would have had to transform itself into a credible force for government and a guarantor of stability. It would have had to move on from protest to the art of governing. The reason it wasn\u2019t able to is because it was wedded to an anti-growth ideology, which led it to commit a series of errors. It was a mistake to oppose Rome\u2019s nomination for the 2024 Olympics and Turin\u2019s for the 2026 Winter Games. It was a mistake to oppose a high-speed train link between France and Italy, a new motorway in the north of Italy, and a project to drill for oil in territorial waters off the coast. The Five Star Movement has given the impression that it opposes the modernisation of the country. As a result it lost the leadership of the protest movement: first it was wiped out at the regional elections, then it was humiliated at the European elections. Now, with a possible no-confidence vote against Conte, it may lose its prime minister of choice. In this new phase of Italian populism, the nationalists will be in charge, possibly as the result of a deal between Salvini and Giorgia Meloni\u2019s far-right Brothers of Italy party. The country will move even closer to emulating Poland and Hungary. The Five Star Movement will be left with the desperate choice of going under or allying itself with the traditional mainstream parties in an attempt to stop its ex-comrades-in-arms. What\u2019s coming will be aggressive and confrontational. Act two of Italian populism, if Salvini is in charge, will put up a tough fight against anyone trying to get in its way. His political adversaries will have to choose between forming a coalition government in the current parliament, bringing together all the anti-Salvini forces, or a head-on challenge at the polls. Either way, this clash will become a kind of referendum on national identity and the relationship with Europe. The next phase of political struggle in Italy is destined to be a duel between extremes. \u2022 Maurizio Molinari is the editor-in-chief of La Stampa",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cHowever, making their voice heard by damaging public facilities and hindering Hong Kong\u2019s development is not going to lead them anywhere,\u201d he added. \u201cFor now, I think the most important thing is to restore stability and move forward and make efforts to improve the status quo.\u201d</p> \n<p>Inside the stadium walls, military police could be heard talking and joking, briefly seen as doors opened for the lone trooper or two exiting to dispose of lunchtime garbage.</p> \n<p>Below, near the parking area, 20 troopers at a time streamed out dressed in athletic shirts and shorts and returned a short time later laden with their full kit in large camouflage backpacks.</p> \n<p>The process was repeated several times with each platoon exiting and retrieving their kit.

If you have a scar that is healing, it is important to refrain from exercising or moving around, as the tissue may begin to move apart and the scar will take on a larger, rugby-ball shape during remodelling. If you smoke, stop: as well as all its other health risks, smoking has a negative effect on healing and the scar will end up looking much worse.</p> <p>If a scar causes pain, the NHS may be able to help, but for less serious scars that still cause distress, private dermatologists have a variety of treatments aimed at reducing their appearance, including dermarolling (using a small wheel covered with tiny needles to gently prick the face) or subcision (a minor surgical procedure). Overall, though, the best way to reduce scarring is to treat the underlying problem. This isn\u2019t always possible for surgery or burn scars, but many patients have long-lasting scars from acne.

If you have a scar that is healing, it is important to refrain from exercising or moving around, as the tissue may begin to move apart and the scar will take on a larger, rugby-ball shape during remodelling. If you smoke, stop: as well as all its other health risks, smoking has a negative effect on healing and the scar will end up looking much worse. If a scar causes pain, the NHS may be able to help, but for less serious scars that still cause distress, private dermatologists have a variety of treatments aimed at reducing their appearance, including dermarolling (using a small wheel covered with tiny needles to gently prick the face) or subcision (a minor surgical procedure). Overall, though, the best way to reduce scarring is to treat the underlying problem. This isn\u2019t always possible for surgery or burn scars, but many patients have long-lasting scars from acne. Had they sought treatment sooner, they might have less severe scarring or none at all. Dr Bav Shergill is a consultant dermatologist. As told to Serena Bhandari",

But for the Hungarians who organised the picnic three decades ago, comparisons between the two border walls are misguided and offensive.</p> <p>\u201cThe iron curtain was built to imprison us, the fence in 2015 was built to protect us by a democratically elected government,\u201d said L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nagy, of the Pan-European Picnic Foundation. He spoke of disappointment about the criticism of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government from western Europe, and put it down to a patronising attitude among western Europeans, who he said had betrayed Hungary and other central European countries after the fall of communism and did not understand the region\u2019s history.</p> <p>In a recent interview with a Hungarian magazine, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magas, the main organiser of the picnic in Sopron and now a local councillor for Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, said that during trips to western Europe in the 1980s he had envied the tranquility and affluence of life, but he was now less impressed with life further west.</p> <p>He recalled a recent trip to France and Germany during which he had been horrified to encounter gender-neutral toilets and homosexual couples, and quoted German friends he stayed with, dismayed at the prospect of migrants from Africa being housed in their village: \u201cYou\u2019re lucky to have a prime minister like Viktor Orb\u00e1n!\u201d they told him.</p> <p>Whatever people\u2019s attitudes to today\u2019s wave of people fleeing oppression, EU membership remains popular in Hungary, and there is no doubt that for a whole generation of Hungarians the events of August 1989 remain a defining memory on the path to liberation.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the war we were closed in a box for decades. Opening the border gave us back the freedom we didn\u2019t have for so long,\u201d said Ditte Prezn\u00e1nszky, who was a 22-year-old languages student in Budapest in 1989, and travelled to the picnic on a bus arranged by a student summer camp she was attending.</p> <p>The Hungarian government of the time, which had taken steps to start dismantling parts of the border fence several months earlier, gave official blessing to the picnic, and thousands of Austrians came across the border to join the Hungarians for an afternoon of music and speeches. Pliers were handed out and people set about dismantling the fence, which until not long before had been electrified.</p> <p>\u201cI had an uncle who escaped in 1956 and most of us knew the terrible things that had happened on the border, so it was very exciting to cut down the iron curtain,\u201d said Prezn\u00e1nszky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4515d5705e3ffa3156377252833cb6e6c5feeb6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4515d5705e3ffa3156377252833cb6e6c5feeb6c/0_0_2048_1781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"East Germans pass across the border between Hungary and Austria in Hegyeshalom on 11 September 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"870\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">East Germans pass across the border between Hungary and Austria in Hegyeshalom on 11 September 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The organisers insist they had not banked on the arrival of hundreds of East Germans, who were allowed to holiday in Hungary but not to travel to the west. Still, tipped off by West German diplomats in the country, several hundred travelled to Sopron and burst through the border gate and into Austria. The guards on duty decided not to shoot, and although the border crossing was resealed a day later, the tide had turned. Overcoming worries of how Moscow would react, Hungary\u2019s government opened the border properly on 11 September and tens of thousands of East Germans passed through.</p> <p>Nowadays there is heavy traffic in both directions across the border. Sopron has found a niche in dental tourism, with Germans and Austrians travelling to the town to receive cut-price treatment, while thousands of Hungarians go the other way in search of higher salaries.</p> <p>The border post was removed when Hungary joined the European Union\u2019s Schengen zone in 2007, but Austrian border guards reappeared in 2015 during the migration crisis and have remained in place. \u201cThey\u2019re there, but they will only stop you if you\u2019re brown. They\u2019re racist but nobody cares, you in the west only care about harassing Hungary for being racist because we are the doormat of Europe,\u201d said Nagy.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 August 2019 to clarify that Angela Merkel was brought up, not born, in East Germany.</p>",

Orb\u00e1n\u2019s media empire railed against Merkel\u2019s decision in 2015 to extend a welcome to those fleeing war, and he has been the most extreme of the many anti-migration politicians in central Europe, warning of a Muslim \u201cinvasion\u201d of Europe and calling for strongly guarded borders. It is a far cry from a declaration made at the time of the picnic, calling for \u201cthe demolition of barbed wires and cultural barriers raised by political chicanery\u201d to achieve worldwide peace. But for the Hungarians who organised the picnic three decades ago, comparisons between the two border walls are misguided and offensive. \u201cThe iron curtain was built to imprison us, the fence in 2015 was built to protect us by a democratically elected government,\u201d said L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nagy, of the Pan-European Picnic Foundation. He spoke of disappointment about the criticism of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government from western Europe, and put it down to a patronising attitude among western Europeans, who he said had betrayed Hungary and other central European countries after the fall of communism and did not understand the region\u2019s history. In a recent interview with a Hungarian magazine, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magas, the main organiser of the picnic in Sopron and now a local councillor for Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, said that during trips to western Europe in the 1980s he had envied the tranquility and affluence of life, but he was now less impressed with life further west. He recalled a recent trip to France and Germany during which he had been horrified to encounter gender-neutral toilets and homosexual couples, and quoted German friends he stayed with, dismayed at the prospect of migrants from Africa being housed in their village: \u201cYou\u2019re lucky to have a prime minister like Viktor Orb\u00e1n!\u201d they told him. Whatever people\u2019s attitudes to today\u2019s wave of people fleeing oppression, EU membership remains popular in Hungary, and there is no doubt that for a whole generation of Hungarians the events of August 1989 remain a defining memory on the path to liberation. \u201cAfter the war we were closed in a box for decades. Opening the border gave us back the freedom we didn\u2019t have for so long,\u201d said Ditte Prezn\u00e1nszky, who was a 22-year-old languages student in Budapest in 1989, and travelled to the picnic on a bus arranged by a student summer camp she was attending. The Hungarian government of the time, which had taken steps to start dismantling parts of the border fence several months earlier, gave official blessing to the picnic, and thousands of Austrians came across the border to join the Hungarians for an afternoon of music and speeches. Pliers were handed out and people set about dismantling the fence, which until not long before had been electrified. \u201cI had an uncle who escaped in 1956 and most of us knew the terrible things that had happened on the border, so it was very exciting to cut down the iron curtain,\u201d said Prezn\u00e1nszky. The organisers insist they had not banked on the arrival of hundreds of East Germans, who were allowed to holiday in Hungary but not to travel to the west. Still, tipped off by West German diplomats in the country, several hundred travelled to Sopron and burst through the border gate and into Austria. The guards on duty decided not to shoot, and although the border crossing was resealed a day later, the tide had turned. Overcoming worries of how Moscow would react, Hungary\u2019s government opened the border properly on 11 September and tens of thousands of East Germans passed through. Nowadays there is heavy traffic in both directions across the border. Sopron has found a niche in dental tourism, with Germans and Austrians travelling to the town to receive cut-price treatment, while thousands of Hungarians go the other way in search of higher salaries. The border post was removed when Hungary joined the European Union\u2019s Schengen zone in 2007, but Austrian border guards reappeared in 2015 during the migration crisis and have remained in place. \u201cThey\u2019re there, but they will only stop you if you\u2019re brown. They\u2019re racist but nobody cares, you in the west only care about harassing Hungary for being racist because we are the doormat of Europe,\u201d said Nagy. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 August 2019 to clarify that Angela Merkel was brought up, not born, in East Germany.",

Any big fiscal moves would be dealt with in a budget which is due this autumn, possibly after the UK has left the EU on no-deal terms on 31 October.",

      "body": "<p>For 12 years now, Anita Pires has been working at the call centre for Camelot, the company that runs the UK\u2019s national lottery. She is one of a staff of 30 who answer calls from potential lottery winners, checking their numbers for prizes that range from \u00a35 to the multi-millions. \u201cIn 2009, I had one of my biggest winners, who won \u00a345m,\u201d she says. \u201cEven I couldn\u2019t believe it. We only get an automated prompt just before they\u2019re put through; it\u2019s always very exciting. The claimants are in shock and don\u2019t really comprehend that it\u2019s millions in cash. There\u2019s a real buzz in the office, with everyone anticipating who might get the call from a big winner that week.\u201d</p> <p>According to a 2016 report, more than 700,000 people in the UK are employed by call centres The work is often tough: it can be a difficult mix of monotony, stress and the emotional labour of staying friendly for hour upon hour of calls. But for a few call-centre employees such as Pires, the work is pure joy.</p> <p>She describes her job as her \u201cpermanent part-time employment,\u201d and fits the shifts around looking after her children. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything else. You\u2019re spending so much of your day giving life-changing, amazing news to strangers. Even though I\u2019m not allowed to play [the lottery] myself, being the first one to tell people they\u2019ve won gives me a feeling that money just couldn\u2019t buy.\u201d</p> <p>The next step in the lottery process for major winners \u2013 anything over \u00a350,000 \u2013 is to be referred to a winners\u2019 adviser; a team of seven who speak to the winners and then visit them to ensure the cash transfer. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mystery around what happens,\u201d says Andy Carter, who has been an adviser for 13 years. Like Pires, he can\u2019t imagine working anywhere else. \u201cIt\u2019s a very high-energy job, but because the emotions are so positive, I\u2019m happy to take it home with me,\u201d he says. \u201cYou owe it to the winners to make it exciting, to make them feel like they are the only ones ever.\u201d</p> <p>Carter says winners\u2019 reactions have ranged from fainting to vomiting with excitement and incredulous silence. \u201cYou get some people having a party when you go round, others who don\u2019t believe it and haven\u2019t told a soul \u2013 it\u2019s a real privilege to be there when they tell others for the first time. It\u2019s never underwhelming \u2013 no two days in this job are the same.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c401f6596a83888c1620ea1617d55139b94aa4a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c401f6596a83888c1620ea1617d55139b94aa4a3/369_64_1028_860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I always get that warm, fuzzy feeling when I speak to the winners\u2019 ... national lottery winner adviser Katie Garrett.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"837\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I always get that warm, fuzzy feeling when I speak to the winners\u2019 ... national lottery winner adviser Katie Garrett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Lottery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Katie Garrett has been an adviser for almost 10 years. \u201cEver since I started I\u2019ve been bowled over by the difference this news we share makes to people\u2019s lives,\u201d she says, \u201cI remember one 20-year-old who won \u00a350,000 and who was about to be kicked out of his flat with his mum because she had been made redundant. This money changed everything. No two winners are the same and I always get that warm, fuzzy feeling when I get to speak to them.\u201d Garrett says training for the job includes life coaching, communication and body language skills. \u201cYou need to be able to relate to people from all walks of life. You can go from people in caravans to people in mansions.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not only lottery employees who can make someone\u2019s day \u2013 and potentially change their life \u2013 in a phone conversation. Michael Kelleher has been the director of the <a href=\"https://windhamcampbell.org/\" title=\"\">Windham Campbell prize</a>, one of the largest literary awards, since its inception in 2013 and has called each of the annual winners to share the news that they have won $165,000. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete shock to the writers when they win, because we work really hard to keep it anonymous,\u201d he says. \u201cSo much so that at the beginning people thought I was pranking them.\u201d</p> <p>One of Kelleher\u2019s earliest calls was to the late American writer <a href=\"https://windhamcampbell.org/festival/2013/recipients/salter-james\" title=\"\">James Salter</a> in 2013, who, apparently suspicious, asked him to send the news \u201cin the mail\u201d. When Kelleher does manage to convince a writer of his authenticity, \u201cpeople are always speechless,\u201d he says. \u201cOne winner burst into tears \u2013 his phone was going to be cut off the following day because he couldn\u2019t afford the bill. We really saved him and had a huge impact in allowing him to keep practising his art.\u201d Kelleher has made the call many times but still finds it nerve-racking. \u201cIf anything, I get more nervous now,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I know how much it means to people and how life-changing the acclaim and the money can be. It\u2019s a job I never take for granted.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d13be953f6e6025785959f8f030c35d0a1e9f1f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d13be953f6e6025785959f8f030c35d0a1e9f1f1/0_360_5623_3374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018One winner burst into tears\u2019 ...

Courtney Sheppard began working at the Ucas call centre in 2011. \u201cYou go from the euphoric highs of people getting their results with their parents cheering in the background, to then having someone in tears and worrying they don\u2019t have a place, so we have to be prepared for that,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone who works here wants to make a difference and support people; we\u2019re that calm, reasonable voice on the end of the line who outlines the options, to give them some hope.\u201d</p> <p>With as many as 30,000 people calling the team in a day, it is a demanding job, but one that Sheppard feels is potentially life-changing in how it prepares students as they embark on their adult lives. \u201cEvery person who works with us on A-level results day comes back saying it was such an important experience. Even though it\u2019s intense, they feel a real sense of achievement in supporting these students.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most momentous cold-calling tasks each year is undertaken by G\u00f6ran K Hansson, who, as secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy, informs Nobel prizewinners of their triumph.

      "bodyText": "Home Office agencies embroiled in the Windrush scandal have reported rising levels of discrimination in the workplace, an official survey has revealed. Employees at the Border Force and Immigration Enforcement, which played a key role in the wrongful detention and prosecution of people who rightfully came to the UK from the Caribbean, told an internal survey they face increasing levels of discrimination from colleagues. The findings raise further questions about a failure by Home Office ministers to address systemic and cultural problems within the department which were highlighted by MPs in March. The internal survey of civil servants found that more than a fifth of staff at Border Force have experienced discrimination while carrying out their duties \u2013 the worst figure for any of the UK\u2019s 89 government agencies and departments. Four in 10 employees did not agree that Border Force is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive workplace, and the agency also records the worst score of any UK government department for \u201crespecting individual differences\u201d. Border Force is directly accountable to ministers and is responsible for immigration and customs at 140 rail, air and sea ports in the UK and western Europe. Staff at Immigration Enforcement (IE), the body whose targets for \u201cillegal immigration\u201d removals were at the heart of the scandal, have reported rising levels of discrimination in the workplace over the past year. One in every five IE employees (20%) told the civil service people survey they had \u201cpersonally experienced discrimination at work\u201d. The Home Office, which resumed direct responsibility for the UK Border Force in 2013, continues to be dogged by accusations of racism and the fallout from the Windrush scandal, which was first highlighted by the Guardian. In recent months, a group of MPs referred the department to the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The National Audit Office launched a separate investigation into the decision to accuse 34,000 international students of cheating on English language tests, and whistleblowers alleged that a culture of incompetence and bullying had led to failed deportations and the unlawful detention of vulnerable people. Last month, it emerged the government is still to make compensation payments to Windrush victims 15 months after Theresa May apologised and promised a financial settlement. The survey was updated with the latest figures on diversity and discrimination in April. It measures staff opinion in around 100 public agencies and around 300,000 employees take part. It highlights the discontent surrounding discrimination among employees at the Border Force, as new changes to immigration rules after Brexit are expected to exacerbate demand and pressure. Commenting on the findings, Labour MP for Greenwich and Woolwich, Matthew Pennycook, said: \u201cIt is deeply alarming that more than one in five immigration staff have personally witnessed discrimination and harassment at work during the course of the last year.

      "bodyText": "Trials of new digital alert technology to monitor hospital patients with sepsis have saved hundreds of lives, the NHS has said. Plans to roll out the \u201caction and alert\u201d technology across England as part of the NHS Long Term Plan are under way after trials at three hospitals. The results showed the system helped doctors better spot the deadly condition and respond quickly when it worsens. Sepsis, a form of blood poisoning, is thought to kill about 50,000 people a year in the UK. It occurs when the immune system damages tissues and organs as it responds to infection in the body. The technology also alerts doctors to deteriorating conditions that are a warning sign of sepsis. It measures the patient\u2019s vital signs and sends a message to clinicians if it predicts or detects sepsis or signs of deterioration. It will then suggest the next steps to prevent the patient from worsening, without the need for doctors to consult separate paper charts. The pilot schemes at hospitals in Cambridge, Liverpool and Berkshire led to a fall in the number of deaths from sepsis, while screening rates have gone up. Up to 200 lives are thought to have been saved a year at the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University hospitals NHS trust, with deaths from septic shock in the under-45s decreasing from six in 10 patients to less than one in 10. \u201cWe have seen a major impact on sepsis care with lives saved. In some cases it would have been impossible to make a diagnosis of sepsis without the help of our digital system,\u201d said Dr Paul Fitzsimmons, the trust\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cBy providing automated sepsis alerts from clinical information from multiple sources, we are treating septic patients both faster and more effectively, helping our clinicians prioritise doing the right things first and reducing death rates in severe sepsis\u201d. Cambridge University hospitals NHS foundation trust reported that deaths have fallen consistently over the last three years, with at least 64 lives saved in the past year. At the Royal Berkshire NHS foundation trust, screening rates have increased by 70% and nine in 10 patients are now screened for the condition when they are admitted to hospital. \u201cSepsis is an extremely serious condition, but as part of the NHS Long Term Plan we have made huge improvements in spotting and treating it quickly, with more than nine in 10 people getting the checks they need,\u201d said Celia Ingham Clark, the medical director for clinical effectiveness at NHS England. \u201cNow, with the help of innovative digital tools, the NHS is saving more lives by getting even better at identifying and treating sepsis. \u201cThe systems at Liverpool, Cambridge and Berkshire are life-saving and as more hospitals adopt digital tools, thousands more families will be spared the harm and heartbreak of sepsis\u201d. Dr Simon Eccles, chief clinical information officer at NHSX, the new NHS digital technology unit, said: \u201cAs an emergency medicine consultant, I know first-hand how helpful these technologies can be on a busy shift, to alert you to a deteriorating patient who might have sepsis and offering the best possible chance of saving their lives.\u201d The UK Sepsis Trust welcomed the initiative. \u201cAny kind of technology which assists clinicians in making prompt decisions when the warning signs of sepsis are detected should be embraced; with every hour that passes before the right antibiotics are administered the risk of death increases,\u201d said Dr Ron Daniels, the trust\u2019s chief executive.",

It\u2019s both a striking opening and an anomaly, a rare moment of visual spectacle in a show that feels remarkably understated and restrained.

Nevertheless, Grande can really sing. The show opens with her performing The Four Seasons\u2019 doo-woop-y 1961 hit <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-ZoJSLB2N18\">An Angel Cried</a> a capella. She posseses a falsetto that she can turn up to full <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hldUBgXtVFk\">Minnie-Ripperton-doing-Lovin\u2019</a><a href=\"https://youtu.be/hldUBgXtVFk\">-You</a> levels, a sound that\u2019s simultaneously hugely impressive and nerve-jangling enough to make you grateful she deploys it quite sparingly. It says something about arena-sized pop shows that the sound of someone singing live feels striking.</p> <p>Meanwhile, anyone hoping to hear her open her heart up goes home unhappy. Stage chat is at a minimum and fixed firmly to the standard inquiries about whether everyone is having a good time. The only thing you could take as a reference to events of the last two years, the terrorist attack on her Manchester Arena show and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/09/mac-miller-obituary\">death of former boyfriend Mac Miller</a> among them, is the unexplained appearance of a clip from the 1996 film <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5YBmnlAeijk\">The First Wives Club</a>: a movie that, beneath the gags, is ultimately about female resilience.</p> <p>If that\u2019s the show\u2019s message, then fans seem to have got it.

It says something about arena-sized pop shows that the sound of someone singing live feels striking. Meanwhile, anyone hoping to hear her open her heart up goes home unhappy. Stage chat is at a minimum and fixed firmly to the standard inquiries about whether everyone is having a good time. The only thing you could take as a reference to events of the last two years, the terrorist attack on her Manchester Arena show and the death of former boyfriend Mac Miller among them, is the unexplained appearance of a clip from the 1996 film The First Wives Club: a movie that, beneath the gags, is ultimately about female resilience. If that\u2019s the show\u2019s message, then fans seem to have got it. For all the high-pitched hysteria afforded the hits \u2013 Thank U, Next; Dangerous Woman; Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I\u2019m Bored \u2013 the most vociferous response is generated by Breathin\u2019, a song about overcoming panic attacks and anxiety. It\u2019s proof that in a world of pop songs filled with self-help mantras, Grande\u2019s have clearly hit home. That\u2019s what people are here for. At the O2 Arena, London, 17-20 August and 15-16 October.",

\n<p>Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, this month <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/consultations-and-statements/category-3/proposed-changes-bbc-iplayer\">gave the green light</a> for the biggest expansion of the BBC iPlayer <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/06_june/27/iplayer.shtml\">since its launch in 2007</a>, to enable the corporation to fight back in

Ofcom has said the BBC needs to \u201cadequately compensate\u201d producers and that it may have to look to pay a higher price for programming.</p> \n<p>However, Pact, the body representing the multibillion-pound UK independent TV production industry, says it has been repeatedly contacted by members reporting that the BBC is trying to get them to sign off on using their shows for longer on the iPlayer without paying more.</p> \n<p>Pact says the tactics started in April, when the BBC\u2019s proposal to extend iPlayer viewing rights to a year were first made public, and has prompted it to take the step of warning its entire member base about the issue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ae811a36-ab00-4a63-972c-4c433c695e1f\"

has consistently sought to strong-arm suppliers into giving the BBC these rights for no compensation and without a proper agreement,\u201d said John McVay, Pact\u2019s chief executive. \u201cPact has warned its members three times since April that the BBC has not yet reached an agreement with Pact for its ambitious plans.\u201d</p> \n<p>In addition, the BBC is also planning a huge expansion of the iPlayer to make programmes available on the service for up to five years in total.</p> \n<p>Proposals to do this were not part of Ofcom\u2019s assessment, which has agreed to allow only children\u2019s content to be made available on the iPlayer exclusively for five years, as the corporation wants to keep shows for a further four years on a non-exclusive basis.</p> \n<p>According to production company executives, the BBC is offering a pittance for deals offering a further two packages of streaming rights to programmes lasting two years each \u2013 after they have been exclusively on the iPlayer for a year \u2013 to keep shows on the service.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe proposed payment structure for these periods is risible,\u201d said one senior production industry executive. \u201cHaving shows effectively permanently available on the iPlayer will depress the price that anyone else will want to pay for it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The BBC has also been accused of trying to give <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/19/bbc-and-itv-unveil-launch-plans-for-britbox-streaming-service-netflix\">BritBox</a>, its joint venture subscription streaming service with ITV due to launch this year, an advantage by being first in line to pick up shows after they leave the iPlayer, instead of services such as Netflix.</p> \n<p>Following the end of the one-year exclusivity window on iPlayer, the BBC is proposing that shows then only be allowed to be sold to a platform or broadcaster that \u201cinvests in and supports the UK creative industries\u201d that also agrees to carry \u201cprominent and approved\u201d BBC branding and provide audience performance data. If producers want to wait to sell to anyone they like, they can do so only after 18 months, under the BBC plan.</p> \n<p>This has been viewed by the production industry as attempting to eliminate Netflix as a bidder for shows once they are first allowed to be sold beyond the iPlayer.</p> \n<p>Netflix prefers to brand shows it buys the rights to as its own in international markets \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/20/bbc-bodyguard-netflix-original-streaming\">the BBC\u2019s Bodyguard was known as a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/20/bbc-bodyguard-netflix-original-streaming\">Netflix Original</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/20/bbc-bodyguard-netflix-original-streaming\"> outside the UK</a> \u2013 and is secretive about sharing any data on the popularity of shows on its platform.</p> \n<p>One production industry source said: \u201cYou could have a situation where a programme is being broadcast on TV by the BBC for free, is on the iPlayer for free but also on BritBox where you would have to pay for it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ofcom has said the extension of iPlayer rights to a year will have an \u201cadverse impact\u201d on the launch of BritBox, but ITV has dismissed those concerns and did not object to the BBC\u2019s plans.</p> \n<p>However, Ofcom has estimated that the increase in viewing of BBC iPlayer content will mean an audience reduction at Channel 4\u2019s All4, ITV\u2019s ITV Hub and Channel 5\u2019s My5 and other online platforms. The loss of advertising revenue as a result is estimated at almost \u00a315m next year, although Channel 4 says it will be higher, with Ofcom estimating that losses will grow in subsequent years.</p> \n<p>\u201cBoth viewers and production companies win by making programmes available for longer on BBC iPlayer,\u201d said a BBC spokesman. \u201cThis is about keeping up with viewer expectations and is long overdue. Audiences are choosing to consume content on demand and the value they receive from their licence fee should reflect that shift.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe continue to have conversations with Pact and production companies to make this happen. Longer BBC iPlayer availability does not reduce the opportunities for them commercially, rather, success on the BBC leads to commercial success for independently produced programmes.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>\u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a> or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>.</strong></p>",

Pact says the tactics started in April, when the BBC\u2019s proposal to extend iPlayer viewing rights to a year were first made public, and has prompted it to take the step of warning its entire member base about the issue. \u201cThe BBC has consistently sought to strong-arm suppliers into giving the BBC these rights for no compensation and without a proper agreement,\u201d said John McVay, Pact\u2019s chief executive. \u201cPact has warned its members three times since April that the BBC has not yet reached an agreement with Pact for its ambitious plans.\u201d In addition, the BBC is also planning a huge expansion of the iPlayer to make programmes available on the service for up to five years in total. Proposals to do this were not part of Ofcom\u2019s assessment, which has agreed to allow only children\u2019s content to be made available on the iPlayer exclusively for five years, as the corporation wants to keep shows for a further four years on a non-exclusive basis. According to production company executives, the BBC is offering a pittance for deals offering a further two packages of streaming rights to programmes lasting two years each \u2013 after they have been exclusively on the iPlayer for a year \u2013 to keep shows on the service. \u201cThe proposed payment structure for these periods is risible,\u201d said one senior production industry executive. \u201cHaving shows effectively permanently available on the iPlayer will depress the price that anyone else will want to pay for it.\u201d The BBC has also been accused of trying to give BritBox, its joint venture subscription streaming service with ITV due to launch this year, an advantage by being first in line to pick up shows after they leave the iPlayer, instead of services such as Netflix. Following the end of the one-year exclusivity window on iPlayer, the BBC is proposing that shows then only be allowed to be sold to a platform or broadcaster that \u201cinvests in and supports the UK creative industries\u201d that also agrees to carry \u201cprominent and approved\u201d BBC branding and provide audience performance data. If producers want to wait to sell to anyone they like, they can do so only after 18 months, under the BBC plan. This has been viewed by the production industry as attempting to eliminate Netflix as a bidder for shows once they are first allowed to be sold beyond the iPlayer. Netflix prefers to brand shows it buys the rights to as its own in international markets \u2013 the BBC\u2019s Bodyguard was known as a Netflix Original outside the UK \u2013 and is secretive about sharing any data on the popularity of shows on its platform. One production industry source said: \u201cYou could have a situation where a programme is being broadcast on TV by the BBC for free, is on the iPlayer for free but also on BritBox where you would have to pay for it.\u201d Ofcom has said the extension of iPlayer rights to a year will have an \u201cadverse impact\u201d on the launch of BritBox, but ITV has dismissed those concerns and did not object to the BBC\u2019s plans. However, Ofcom has estimated that the increase in viewing of BBC iPlayer content will mean an audience reduction at Channel 4\u2019s All4, ITV\u2019s ITV Hub and Channel 5\u2019s My5 and other online platforms. The loss of advertising revenue as a result is estimated at almost \u00a315m next year, although Channel 4 says it will be higher, with Ofcom estimating that losses will grow in subsequent years. \u201cBoth viewers and production companies win by making programmes available for longer on BBC iPlayer,\u201d said a BBC spokesman. \u201cThis is about keeping up with viewer expectations and is long overdue. Audiences are choosing to consume content on demand and the value they receive from their licence fee should reflect that shift. \u201cWe continue to have conversations with Pact and production companies to make this happen. Longer BBC iPlayer availability does not reduce the opportunities for them commercially, rather, success on the BBC leads to commercial success for independently produced programmes.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

      "body": "<p>Giles Duley, a 47-year-old photographer, is no stranger to some of the world\u2019s most desperate places. His work on the impact of war has taken him to Lebanon, South Sudan, Ukraine and Afghanistan, where in 2011 he lost both legs and his left arm after stepping on a landmine. But his experience in Mosul, Iraq, in the spring of 2017, covering the fallout of the military campaign to retake the city from Islamic State, was something else.</p> <p>\u201cI saw some of the worst things I\u2019d ever seen in terms of war \u2013 just horrific things,\u201d says Duley, shaking his head. \u201cIt was overwhelming and I came back in quite a dark place from that trip. It was shut the curtains, I don\u2019t want to speak to anyone. And I just started cooking, I started making pasta and bread. I realised that was therapy for me, because when you\u2019ve got those dark thoughts and you\u2019ve seen children injured, you can put the television on or you can read a book, but you are still thinking about those things. You can\u2019t get away from them. But I found cooking was the one time I did, because I think it\u2019s the manual tasks: you are lost in that moment.</p> <p>\u201cSuddenly I was cooking obsessively,\u201d he goes on, \u201cgetting up at 4am, making bread, cooking all day. Literally going up to my neighbours and saying, \u2018Would you like a whole meal?\u2019 I hadn\u2019t eaten any of it, because I was already stuffed, but I\u2019d just made a load of cannelloni.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting in Duley\u2019s sun-drenched living room in St Leonards-on-Sea, watching him skilfully prepare fennel and lemon risotto with scallops, the horrors of Mosul feel a world away. But Duley\u2019s obsession with cooking has continued \u2013 in fact probably intensified \u2013 and now influences both his life and work. The fun side is an Instagram feed called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/one_armed_chef/?hl=en\" title=\"\">The One Armed Chef</a>, where he shares the food he cooks at home and eats on his travels with more than 5,000 followers. Duley began posting photographs a couple of years ago, mainly as a distraction from his day job. But there\u2019s also a serious element \u2013 a comment on how many of us respond to disability.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When a family invites me in and lets me cook with them, I feel like the most privileged person in the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really a \u2018fuck you\u2019 to people in restaurants who said, \u2018Oh, can I cut that up for you?\u2019\u201d says Duley. \u201cBecause I would turn around to them and show them a handmade egg-yolk ravioli and they\u2019d go, \u2018Uh?\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018I did that one-handed, I think I can cut my potato in half.\u2019 I know people want to help, but it\u2019s humiliating that somebody just assumes you can\u2019t do something one-handed. Just because somebody\u2019s different it doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t do things that you can\u2019t even do.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, Duley was contacted by Instagram\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco, saying it was an admirer of his work and wanted to feature it on its main feed. Duley was thrilled: he knows how difficult it is to reach an audience with stories of refugees. Only later did he realise that Instagram was reaching out to The One Armed Chef. \u201cAnd they were like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re a photographer as well?\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cYes, I can also do that!\u201d</p> <p>Nothing in Duley\u2019s kitchen, or indeed his flat, has been altered because of his injuries: \u201cI always say the only thing that was adapted was my patience.\u201d He notes, with a laugh, that some things which sound easy are actually near-impossible, and vice versa. \u201cI can travel to Iraq on my own and take photographs,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I can\u2019t put a woolly hat on.\u201d When he first started cooking, frying an egg was an ordeal, just standing at the stove in his prosthetic legs. Even now he has to plan ahead when he puts a heavy casserole dish in the oven, because it\u2019s awkward to remove it with one hand.</p> <p>Food increasingly plays a central role in Duley\u2019s work, too. Now, when he meets a family he wants to photograph, he asks to cook with them first. It might be borscht in Ukraine or goat stew in central Africa; he\u2019s also eaten land snails in Nigeria and fried tarantulas in north Cambodia, but he\u2019d rather not dwell on that. Only after he\u2019s spent hours preparing food with someone will Duley lift his camera to take a picture.</p> <p>\u201cWhen a family invites me into their house and lets me cook with them, I feel like the most privileged person in the world, because you have that moment of intimacy with them,\u201d says Duley. \u201cFor them it\u2019s a sign of respect: I\u2019m not just there to get your story, I\u2019m not taking your story from you, I want to learn about you and I want to understand you.</p> <p>\u201cThe difference between an acquaintance and a friend is when we\u2019ve eaten together.\u201d</p> <h2>Cooking with frozen chicken in Mosul, Iraq</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfc7d5828cccc11b6c1cc9591501c7576a23820c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfc7d5828cccc11b6c1cc9591501c7576a23820c/0_0_11811_7088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laila cooking for her four grandchildren in Mosul, Ira.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laila cooking for her four grandchildren in Mosul, Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Duley/Save the Children</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn this family, the father had died.

They\u2019d patched up the roof, and his older brother was living there with him, looking after him, because their father had passed away since then, too.</p> <p>I thought, \u2018Do you know what, I don\u2019t need to talk to him about it because you don\u2019t need to, to understand that that was a terrible thing.\u2019 So what I did was ask him questions about the food they used to have and the traditions of their food.</p> <p>Of course, being Ukraine it was all about the borscht. And so I said: \u2018Can I come back tomorrow? Why don\u2019t we cook together?\u2019</p> <p>So I did, and that taste will never leave me. It was beautiful that borscht, and we were all laughing.\u201d</p> <h2>Eating with a Syrian family in Lebanon and Holland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff517edb11966c2c795064045120e6be90ee40f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff517edb11966c2c795064045120e6be90ee40f2/0_549_11811_7085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamal cooking in the Bekaa valley, Lebanon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamal cooking in the Bekaa valley, Lebanon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Duley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI met Khouloud and Jamal in 2014, when I was just starting to work again.

      "bodyText": "Giles Duley, a 47-year-old photographer, is no stranger to some of the world\u2019s most desperate places. His work on the impact of war has taken him to Lebanon, South Sudan, Ukraine and Afghanistan, where in 2011 he lost both legs and his left arm after stepping on a landmine. But his experience in Mosul, Iraq, in the spring of 2017, covering the fallout of the military campaign to retake the city from Islamic State, was something else. \u201cI saw some of the worst things I\u2019d ever seen in terms of war \u2013 just horrific things,\u201d says Duley, shaking his head. \u201cIt was overwhelming and I came back in quite a dark place from that trip. It was shut the curtains, I don\u2019t want to speak to anyone. And I just started cooking, I started making pasta and bread. I realised that was therapy for me, because when you\u2019ve got those dark thoughts and you\u2019ve seen children injured, you can put the television on or you can read a book, but you are still thinking about those things. You can\u2019t get away from them. But I found cooking was the one time I did, because I think it\u2019s the manual tasks: you are lost in that moment. \u201cSuddenly I was cooking obsessively,\u201d he goes on, \u201cgetting up at 4am, making bread, cooking all day. Literally going up to my neighbours and saying, \u2018Would you like a whole meal?\u2019 I hadn\u2019t eaten any of it, because I was already stuffed, but I\u2019d just made a load of cannelloni.\u201d Sitting in Duley\u2019s sun-drenched living room in St Leonards-on-Sea, watching him skilfully prepare fennel and lemon risotto with scallops, the horrors of Mosul feel a world away. But Duley\u2019s obsession with cooking has continued \u2013 in fact probably intensified \u2013 and now influences both his life and work. The fun side is an Instagram feed called The One Armed Chef, where he shares the food he cooks at home and eats on his travels with more than 5,000 followers. Duley began posting photographs a couple of years ago, mainly as a distraction from his day job. But there\u2019s also a serious element \u2013 a comment on how many of us respond to disability. \u201cIt\u2019s really a \u2018fuck you\u2019 to people in restaurants who said, \u2018Oh, can I cut that up for you?\u2019\u201d says Duley. \u201cBecause I would turn around to them and show them a handmade egg-yolk ravioli and they\u2019d go, \u2018Uh?\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018I did that one-handed, I think I can cut my potato in half.\u2019 I know people want to help, but it\u2019s humiliating that somebody just assumes you can\u2019t do something one-handed.

He\u2019d been on the roof collecting water and a drone strike had killed him. A few weeks later, a mortar had gone off in the garden and killed the grandfather. The mother was hit by shrapnel in the kitchen and died over several days. So it was just the grandmother Laila and four grandchildren left. The house was like a film set, if you were getting central casting to make a bomb-damaged house. It had blackened walls, windows with bullet holes. It was horrific. I arranged to cook with the grandmother and the only things I could find in Mosul were a frozen chicken, a bag of rice and a couple of onions. It turned out she was a terrible chef! We later discovered that her sister used to help her cook. We spent the first hour trying to break the chicken to get it in the pot. We got a knife and hammer and smashed it. The kids were laughing and jokes were being made, and there was a warmth to what was happening. Then we sat down and ate. Arab food is personal because you put your hands in the food together.

      "bodyText": "Paul Dacre is to step in front of television cameras after Channel 4 signed up the former editor of the Daily Mail to take part in a documentary series exploring how he helped shape modern Britain. In The World According to Paul Dacre, the journalist will talk about his quarter of a century in charge of the newspaper and how he used it to exert influence over the UK\u2019s political life. \u201cTelling the extraordinary story of how he shaped the Mail as the voice of middle England, he will share his unique insights into the events and the people who defined the front page of his newspaper,\u201d Channel 4 said. The series will \u201cbring to life the decisions, debates and dilemmas that faced the editor of the Daily Mail throughout his tenure\u201d and chart the \u201chighs and lows\u201d of working at the forefront of newspapers for the last 25 years. Dacre cultivated an aloof presence while in the editor\u2019s chair at the Daily Mail, giving only a handful of interviews during his tenure and making a small number of public appearances. He tended to use his newspaper\u2019s front page to make incendiary attacks on liberals, immigration, society\u2019s perceived decline and the European Union, while his notoriously profane outbursts were heard only by fellow staff inside the Mail\u2019s offices. During the aftermath of the EU referendum he branded high court judges who had allowed parliament a vote on Brexit \u201cenemies of the people\u201d. Since being edged out of the job last year in favour of a new editor, Geordie Greig, he has occasionally ventured into the pages of the Spectator to write diary columns, and he took part in a documentary series about the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Last month Dacre described his shock at the election of Boris Johnson as Conservative party leader. \u201cSo, the party of family values has chosen as leader a man of whom to say he has the morals of an alley cat would be to libel the feline species,\u201d he said. At the end of last year he gave a valedictory speech to the Society of Editors\u2019 annual conference, which largely consisted of a lengthy attack on the values and editorial line of the Guardian. Dacre\u2019s time in charge of the Mail left him a loathed figure on the left of British politics but his mix of scandal and outrage appealed to middle England, allowing him to depart the newspaper in a financially healthy and influential position. The Daily Mail, in common with the entire British newspaper industry, is suffering from heavy falls in sales but is losing print readers at a slower rate than its rivals. Its Saturday edition is now by far the biggest-selling print newspaper in the country, shifting 1.7m copies on the newsstand \u2013 almost double the sale of any Sunday paper. At the current rates of decline the Daily Mail will soon take the title of the biggest-selling British national newspaper from the Sun, albeit in a shrinking market. Its coverage also appears on the wildly successful celebrity-focused MailOnline. Those wishing to hear Dacre\u2019s views on modern Britain will have to wait some time. The Channel 4 series, which has been commissioned for a run of three hour-long programmes, is expected to air in early 2021.",

There\u2019s a video of me singing along that night, so elated I forgot the words.</p> <p><em><strong>That lucky summer</strong></em> feeling is the precise serendipity of participating in fandom. You will spend a lot of time misbehaving to find yourself in situations that should feasibly never happen. You will do things so obnoxious, even in your mid-20s, that no one would look at you and believe it could be true.</p> <p>It began with a photo. The music and politics of Courtney Love and her 90s feminist punk rock band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/25/courtney-love-a-hole-reunion-we-are-definitely-talking-about-it\" title=\"\">Hole</a> would come later, but for me, at the age of 11, there was the feeling from looking at her that this was my person.</p> <p>Interviewing girls and women about why they were fans (or to use recent parlance a \u201cstan\u201d \u2013 stalker-fan), I realise now they couldn\u2019t say why or what happened. They could describe why they loved the person perfectly, but that moment of conception was built from shrugs and clich\u00e9s. They were talking about the hormonal sensation of falling in love \u2013 but for the long-term.</p> <p>One fan, Sam, told me that one of Courtney\u2019s vintage cami dresses was for sale while she was unemployed, so she stole a boyfriend\u2019s car to sell it for scrap. \u201cIt was me and her, even to the point where I want to put her camisole dress in the coffin with me,\u201d she tells me, over the phone, nearing her 40th birthday. \u201cUnless I find an absolute diehard fan to leave it to, it goes in the ground with me.\u201d</p> <p>It was never just about the music, but the whole package of the person making it. Girls choose idols for two reasons: they feel an unmatched affinity with the subject of their love, as though this person was an older sister; or that person possesses the strong qualities they perceive themselves as lacking.</p> <p>To my mind, I looked a bit like a teenage Courtney: big eyes, big nose, mouth and chin, almost pretty but too much to fit on one face. I also had a little pot belly and an insatiable hunger for everything. I was frequently told off for being greedy. I cared deeply about these supposed faults \u2013 but Courtney didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t seem to let anything slow her down.</p> <p>Even for girls in vastly different fandoms (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/15/one-direction-boy-band-exclusive-interview-\" title=\"\">Directioners</a> dreaming of being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/harry-styles\" title=\"\">Harry Styles\u2019s</a> girlfriend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bts\" title=\"\">BTS</a> fans writing fan fiction about their favourite boys), it\u2019s about wanting what the artist has \u2013 their confidence, their freedoms, their world. But with a woman musician who did everything regardless of gender, I felt like I had the full fandom package.</p> <p><em><strong>My childhood world</strong></em> was a quiet one. I grew up in the middle of the countryside. Everyone was off tending to their own problems \u2013 emotional, financial, interpersonal. Courtney\u2019s attitude suggested to me that if I shouted loudly enough, someone would have to hear.</p> <p>Every person has to create themselves. But it\u2019s difficult to make yourself without having a stab at being another person first. I bought bleach from the chemist and, with each box, I\u2019d get more bottle blonde. I\u2019d ignore the nausea from cigarettes and march around the fields at the back of our house practising throaty swear words. I saved every \u00a31 from my weekend jobs to buy an electric guitar. I\u2019d sit in front of the family computer with my guitar unplugged and play. I remember turning around to see my little sister smirking and mouthing, \u201cYou\u2026 suck!\u201d</p> <p>Becoming carefully belligerent, I could test limits, and when I did I was thinking of Courtney Love. Telling a lecherous family friend where to go: \u201cFuck you!\u201d Taking another four slices of bread from the tin: \u201cFuck you!\u201d Running through the house with my sister\u2019s TV and tossing it through an open window: \u201cFuck you!\u201d The beginner guitar player has to start somewhere\u2026 When someone gives you the gift of yourself? Well, you simply have to become a stan.</p> <p><em><strong>You are never </strong></em>someone\u2019s \u201cbiggest\u201d fan. I realised this at Halloween last year when I was wondering if I\u2019d get arrested for breaking and entering with two other middle-aged Courtney fans. There is a renovated industrial factory on the banks of the Hudson River called the <a href=\"https://basilicahudson.org/\" title=\"\">Basilica Hudson</a>. The venue was closed as it was the night before a big event \u2013 a celebration of Courtney Love held by her old Hole bandmate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/12/melissa-auf-der-maur-people-are-afraid-to-care-about-shit\" title=\"\">Melissa Auf der Maur</a>. My friends Jennifer and Tracy had picked me up in their car \u2013 their idea, all theirs \u2013 to look for clues about what would happen the following night. Real fans will never be satisfied with what they\u2019re given. Give us a special night curated to our interests and we\u2019ll invade a day early and make a holiday of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw her in New York, striding about in a fur coat like a wildebeest</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Inside, a local teen-girl band were playing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS1Ckczz0LQ\" title=\"\">Miss World</a> by Hole. I was sweating from the thrill of misbehaving and the fear of getting caught. Then, from her spot behind me, Tracy saw her \u2013 Courtney, in 3D.</p> <p>But then another woman burst through the venue doors. She told us to leave, immediately. Jennifer blinked blankly. When the woman had gone, she held her phone to the window, to live report to others in our Facebook fan group. No one else but us had this night. The three of us fled, half-sprinting across the gravel.</p> <p>Jennifer exhaled and solemnly called me their good luck charm. Most women fans had turned fandom inwards, but these two had hit the golden jackpot, I thought, feeling nauseous with adrenaline.</p> <p><em><strong>The following night,</strong></em> during the celebration, Melissa made a speech to Courtney and thanked her for changing her life, but she extended it to the fans in the room as well. \u201cThe lives you really changed were those in the front row, at home in their bedrooms, holding on to every word and every scream\u2026 You made a safe space for them to be angry, to be beautiful, to be heard and understood.\u201d</p> <p>I looked about to see hundreds of women who I knew had lived a 1,000 difficult lives.

The night was intended to canonise Courtney\u2019s contributions to rock and feminism, but we\u2019d always seen the artist clearly, something fans are rarely given credit for.

Nestling at the bottom of a railway embankment between houses, builders yards and a car rental depot, it has sties, snoozing Gloucester Old Spot pigs, a paddock with caramel-coloured Dexter cattle grazing and vegetable plots in which you might see the farmer and her three young children at work.</p> <p>It is not, as you might assume, a visitor attraction. Founded on the council-owned site of a former market garden, <a href=\"https://bristolfoodproducers.uk/our-members-purple-patch/\" title=\"\">Purple Patch</a> is a fully functioning four-acre smallholding that turns a profit from vegetable boxes, bagged salads and meat. Mary Conway, the 32-year-old who formerly worked for a veg-box scheme in Norwich, set it up five years ago and has become something of a local hero. Her salads \u2013 blends of unusual leaves, herbs and edible flowers \u2013 are popular in the nearby liberal enclave of St Werburghs. She lives in a converted shed on Purple Patch, with her kids and her husband, Jona, a carpenter, and finds any missing suburban comforts amply compensated for by the friendships she makes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice having a relationship with the animals,\u201d says Conway, walking through the yard as the pigs glance up at a train whooshing past. \u201cEspecially the cows, because they\u2019re so emotionally intelligent. But I also love it when you sell someone a bag of salad and later they tell you they thought it was amazing. The relationships you can have with people you\u2019re supplying food for are really great.\u201d</p> <p>Conway is one of the stars of a food phenomenon that has been developing in Bristol since the early 2010s. Back in 2009, the city council and a sustainability group, Bristol Green Capital Partnership, commissioned a <a href=\"http://transitionbristol.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Peak-Oil-Report_01.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> on what might happen to the city if the world began to run out of oil. One of the most alarming revelations was that the food supply, utterly dependent on cheap oil and gas for growing and transportation, could be severely depleted, which in turn could lead to a breakdown of law and order. In response, the NHS commissioned a <a href=\"https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/32619/Who-feeds-Bristol-report.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> exploring Bristol\u2019s food system in more depth, and the council helped set up a <a href=\"https://bristolfoodpolicycouncil.org/\" title=\"\">food policy council</a> to produce a plan based on its findings.</p> <p>One aim of that plan was \u201cto promote the use of good quality land in and around Bristol for food production\u201d. A number of support organisations \u2013 horticulturalists, conservationists and a Bristol chapter of the Incredible Edible \u201cguerilla gardening\u201d movement \u2013 worked with the policy council on this. At first, the focus was on straightforward ideas such as reviving allotments or encouraging container farms that used hydroponics and artificial lighting. But after a couple of years, the leaders of the initiative began to notice something else happening. More people than they had expected were contacting the organisations with ideas that combined social good and an interest in nature with growing, and these people seemed to have few problems finding volunteers to help with the schemes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It isn\u2019t just about food.

Commonly known as the Bearpit, it is a blighted, below-street-level crossroads in the city centre where various subways intersect, and problems of rough sleeping, drug use and petty crime are rife. Sara Venn, a horticulturalist who runs Incredible Edibles as well as sitting on the policy council and chairing the Bristol Food Producers network, knew this would be a serious challenge and was worried it might be vandalised, but agreed to support it with advice and her network of volunteers. They planted flowers, herbs, soft fruit and vegetables, with all the food free to anyone who wanted to pick it; three years later, it continues to flourish.</p> <p>\u201cIncredible Edibles has supported 90 gardens, but the Bearpit had a great impact,\u201d says Venn. \u201cPeople in the city liked it and it got international attention \u2013 I remember getting emails about it from people in Norway, Ireland and Japan. It was a pivotal moment, one that made us all think that a food-growing movement could really happen here. In fact, it could just go mad.\u201d Three years later, the Bristol Food Producers network has 36 producers within 10 miles of the city, and several eateries, including Poco, an award-winning restaurant specialising in local ingredients. \u201cWe\u2019re creating networks so people can access land more easily, become upskilled and find markets for their food,\u201d says Venn. \u201cWe\u2019re helping Bristol to become as self-sufficient as it can be, but it isn\u2019t just about food. It\u2019s about what we want cities to be and the part food can play in that.\u201d</p> <p>Three miles north of the Bearpit, next to the M32 motorway, sits perhaps the most fully realised example of Bristol\u2019s urban farming. Feed Bristol is a six-acre jumble of gardens, vegetable plots, polytunnels, offices and sheds, which has been run as a conservation project by the Avon Wildlife Trust since it leased the site \u2013 then a derelict former market garden \u2013 from the city council in 2012.

Richardson has recently shown that people who feel an emotional and physical connection to nature are 30 times more likely to do something to help the natural environment than those who have just read, or been taught, about it.</p> <p>For Cracknell\u2019s team, that means people learning how to grow vegetables might help to save the world, or at least part of Bristol, which is a good start.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d47472bb416f696e52309e42b9dd118a4cc38e0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d47472bb416f696e52309e42b9dd118a4cc38e0d/0_363_3840_5345/718.jpg\" alt=\"Humphrey Lloyd, of Edible Futures who also helps run the Landworker\u2019s Alliance.\" width=\"718\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Humphrey Lloyd, of Edible Futures who also helps run the Landworker\u2019s Alliance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe city is using food-growing as a holistic solution,\u201d Cracknell says, as we pause to smell a fragrant wildflower meadow abloom with ox-eye daisies and the helpful trefoil. \u201cWe\u2019re reconnecting people with the environment, nature and local food systems. That helps restore nature, and it also helps people.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re the sort of cynical urban person who finds such talk a bit Fotherington-Thomas, you might like to know that many of Bristol\u2019s new pastoralists do have a harder, more political vision of what they\u2019re doing. In the shelter of a large shed stuffed with boxes and tools, 33-year-old Humphrey Lloyd explains that he founded Edible Futures, his Feed-Bristol-based salad and vegetable growing business, \u201cbecause I was interested in climate change and food sovereignty rather than being into gardening as a kid, or enjoying the outdoors. You might have powerful political ideals, but you have to find a way of making a living that fulfils political and ecological roles as well.</p> <p>\u201cThis feels practical, it earns me an income, and it contributes to a different food and political system as well,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>As his sweatshirt logo gives away, he also works for the Landworkers\u2019 Alliance, a small union-cum-campaigning group for farmers and growers who don\u2019t feel the National Farmers\u2019 Union is right for them. He lets people work for him only if he can pay them the minimum wage; Lloyd himself will make \u00a310,000 in 2109 from working roughly half the year on the business, supplementing that with what he earns from a part-time music career.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes you sense an older, countercultural spirit resurfacing in a new guise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s hard growing crops, he says. It\u2019s more technical than he had imagined and requires a substantial knowledge of plant and soil science, as well as the ability to run the back end of a business. On the whole, answers to problems you encounter tend not to be Googleable. A few weeks ago he was having trouble with his peas; they were yellow, which meant they were lacking in nitrogen, but why would that be when there was plenty of nitrogen in the soil? Eventually he discovered that nitrogen provided in the form of horse manure, as this was, couldn\u2019t be accessed by the peas. He had to save them by mixing compost and manure in water, and adding the solution to the plants. How did he work it out? \u201cI asked a mate,\u201d he says, demonstrating the value of those networks and support organisations.</p> <p>Mutual support, finding ways to help each other, adapting old ways of doing things to work in a new world: these ideas crop up time and time again in these food producers\u2019 conversations, providing ample proof that building a food system creates relationships between people. Sometimes you sense an older, countercultural spirit resurfacing in a new guise. Carol Laslett helps run <a href=\"http://www.streetgoat.co.uk\" title=\"\">Street Goat</a>, an organisation that allows communities to work together to run a small herd of milking goats, and hires its billies out to people who need robust grazing on their land (one is currently clearing shrubs at Feed Bristol).</p> <p>Laslett, a veteran of the grow-your-own, self-sufficiency movement of the 1960s and 70s, has a knack of subtly adapting old ways of organising. Street Goat is a cooperative, but that decision was driven not so much by a desire to share the rewards equitably as a recognition that lots of time-starved people could have the contact with animals they craved if they found a way of pooling their scraps of free time.</p> <p>Laslett sees Bristol\u2019s new food movement as a kind of successor, though she\u2019s \u201cnot sure of the scale. Sometimes I think a lot more young people are aware of the issues because of climate change, but then I walk through [Bristol shopping centre] Broadmead and think nothing\u2019s changed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6785819a30baceff3b22fd207afbfb6d41eda4b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6785819a30baceff3b22fd207afbfb6d41eda4b3/0_176_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carol and David Laslett help run Street Goat, a small milking herd.

Its billies are hired out for grazing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The quantity of food that Bristol\u2019s farmers could produce is open to question. Certainly, they can\u2019t hope to make the city self-sufficient. To produce all the food that one average meat-eating British adult consumes in a year, you would need about half a hectare of land \u2013 roughly three-quarters of a large football pitch. Bristol covers 11,000 hectares, so even if you could grass down the entire city, it would feed only 14,700 of the 534,000 residents. The area of publicly accessible green space would feed 1,320, and just 3,300 even if they only ate grains. Having said that, self-sufficiency in specific crops might be just about conceivable. The real output of container farms is contested, but using conservative figures of a 38m<sup>2</sup> container farm producing a tenth of a hectare\u2019s worth of salad leaves a year, you could meet Bristol\u2019s lettuce needs (6.9m heads a year, using UK average consumption figures) with about 1,000 containers, which, with no space between them, would occupy only about 3.7 hectares.</p> <p>Conventional agricultural analysts tend to dismiss new ideas involving small-scale, local food production, citing population growth rates that, they say, mean the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/28/un-farmers-produce-food-population\" title=\"\">world will need 70</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/28/un-farmers-produce-food-population\" title=\"\">% more food</a> by 2050, and pointing out that only large-scale intensive farming could hope to get anywhere near that. They have a point, but their figures overlook, among other things, the vast wastage in the current system, which in 2008 was estimated to be as high as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/us-food-waste-ugly-fruit-vegetables-perfect\" title=\"\">50</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/us-food-waste-ugly-fruit-vegetables-perfect\" title=\"\">%</a>. There could well be a role for more small-scale local production, particularly if the oil supply went awry but, as Venn points out, it isn\u2019t just about the food supply.</p> <p>When looking at cities in this context, she says you start to wonder why we do things the way we do. \u201cWhy are city centres so dominated by concrete, with no community involvement? Why is nature so unwelcome in them? Our cities would be so much more vibrant if we looked at the spaces between buildings in a more meaningful way; those spaces are always the last thing anyone thinks about and we could reverse that, looking at what we need and how we could achieve it by using them. Cities can\u2019t continue to be just about economic growth. They have to be about our health and wellbeing as well.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, the idea of producing food in cities isn\u2019t new and in some ways Bristol could be said to be merely reviving a system of allotments and market gardens that has declined in the past 30 years or so. Nor is it confined to Bristol. There are initiatives in cities across the UK, many adapted to local needs. For example, Bentley Urban Farm near Doncaster has, since it was founded in 2016, worked closely with teenagers who have been excluded from schools, achieving significant improvements in behaviour. The site, Doncaster council\u2019s former horticultural training centre, used to be permanently vandalised, but the excluded children now come to repair it.</p> <p>So could urban farming change the way we live in cities? Or is it destined to be a set of pleasing stories, scraps of bucolic fantasy glimpsed from train windows, or purchased now and again in the form of unusual salads? Sceptics will lean towards the last of these, but it might just be worth reflecting on the origins of our current system.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"16da3b26b89a30808ba585a66e1658ba426b3184\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16da3b26b89a30808ba585a66e1658ba426b3184/0_106_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flower seeds being collected at Feed Bristol, a six-acre wildlife gardening hub.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flower seeds being collected at Feed Bristol, a six-acre wildlife gardening hub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 17th and 18th centuries, a number of British farmers such as Jethro Tull of Berkshire and Norfolk\u2019s Charles Townshend, began experimenting with newfangled equipment and techniques such as seed drills, fertiliser use and crop rotations. These were often mocked by their peers, and some caught on while others didn\u2019t. At the same time, successive governments were making it easy for the wealthy to enclose common land. Once you owned or farmed a lot of land, you had an interest in maximising the return from it, which gave you a motivation for trying out those new ideas and using the ones that produced more crops. And thus the form of farming we now know came about, founded on what amounted to massive government intervention, plus ideas developed on little plots of land, by people who some considered impractical if not barmy.</p> <p>Of course, no one knew at the time that Tull, Townshend and the government were inventing modern agriculture, and no one can know now whether some aspect of our food\u2019s future might be being invented at Purple Patch or on an old horticultural training centre in Doncaster.</p> <p>If you walk north from the Bearpit along Gloucester Road, the street at the heart of Bristol\u2019s alternative community, you come to a cafe that would sit nicely in the kind of future people such as Venn and Cracknell are hoping to build. Suncraft, all pared-back and recycled wood, is a vegan cafe run by restaurateur duo James Koch and James Smailes. It\u2019s particularly notable for the glass tank in which 140 salad greens and microherbs are grown hydroponically for use by the chefs \u2013 a consumer-friendly example of the much-heralded climate-controlled container farming, that is also now being taken up by supermarket salad sections. Sitting in Suncraft one morning, Koch looks at the tank and says, \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about what we harvest at the moment, it\u2019s more that it is interesting for us to start thinking about food in this way. Our customers are also fascinated to look at it and to get into a conversation about urban farming.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an interesting take on how all this might play out for customers. Tesco may be stocking an urban mix salad, using leaves from a <a href=\"http://growing-underground.com/tesco-launch\" title=\"\">London hydroponic farm</a>, Waitrose may be planning to put <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/03/04/pick-aisles-supermarkets-year-bio-engineers-reveal-talks-waitrose/\" title=\"\">tanks in </a><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/03/04/pick-aisles-supermarkets-year-bio-engineers-reveal-talks-waitrose/\" title=\"\">its salad aisles</a>, but no one\u2019s pretending that there\u2019s huge consumer demand for food grown in cities. Dermot O\u2019Regan, founder of the Grow Bristol urban farming consultancy that installed and manages Suncraft\u2019s tanks, believes urban food will be as important as an educational debate starter as it will a source of food. Having set up, and then sold, one of the country\u2019s first container farms in Bristol in 2015, he\u2019s sceptical about claims that that kind of small-scale production can make money; he just about made money on the quick-growing microgreens, but had he wanted to grow lettuce, he would have had to charge about \u00a320 a head. However, as an entertaining, conversation-starting feature in shops and restaurants, it could be invaluable.</p> <p>\u201cIt gets people to think about where their food is from,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat does natural mean when rural fields might be near roads and all the work in them is done by machinery using oil? Should we be thinking about eating more algae, seaweed and insects? Can people be persuaded to pay for more sustainable food? How can we distribute it to make it as accessible as supermarket food? It opens up all sort of issues, and that\u2019s important. Because whatever you think about urban farming, you can\u2019t really look at the current food system and says that it\u2019s working, can you?\u201d</p> <p><em>Read more about the future of cities at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\" title=\"\">theguardian.com/cities</a></em></p>",

Nestling at the bottom of a railway embankment between houses, builders yards and a car rental depot, it has sties, snoozing Gloucester Old Spot pigs, a paddock with caramel-coloured Dexter cattle grazing and vegetable plots in which you might see the farmer and her three young children at work. It is not, as you might assume, a visitor attraction. Founded on the council-owned site of a former market garden, Purple Patch is a fully functioning four-acre smallholding that turns a profit from vegetable boxes, bagged salads and meat. Mary Conway, the 32-year-old who formerly worked for a veg-box scheme in Norwich, set it up five years ago and has become something of a local hero. Her salads \u2013 blends of unusual leaves, herbs and edible flowers \u2013 are popular in the nearby liberal enclave of St Werburghs.

Richardson has recently shown that people who feel an emotional and physical connection to nature are 30 times more likely to do something to help the natural environment than those who have just read, or been taught, about it. For Cracknell\u2019s team, that means people learning how to grow vegetables might help to save the world, or at least part of Bristol, which is a good start. \u201cThe city is using food-growing as a holistic solution,\u201d Cracknell says, as we pause to smell a fragrant wildflower meadow abloom with ox-eye daisies and the helpful trefoil. \u201cWe\u2019re reconnecting people with the environment, nature and local food systems. That helps restore nature, and it also helps people.\u201d If you\u2019re the sort of cynical urban person who finds such talk a bit Fotherington-Thomas, you might like to know that many of Bristol\u2019s new pastoralists do have a harder, more political vision of what they\u2019re doing. In the shelter of a large shed stuffed with boxes and tools, 33-year-old Humphrey Lloyd explains that he founded Edible Futures, his Feed-Bristol-based salad and vegetable growing business, \u201cbecause I was interested in climate change and food sovereignty rather than being into gardening as a kid, or enjoying the outdoors. You might have powerful political ideals, but you have to find a way of making a living that fulfils political and ecological roles as well. \u201cThis feels practical, it earns me an income, and it contributes to a different food and political system as well,\u201d he adds. As his sweatshirt logo gives away, he also works for the Landworkers\u2019 Alliance, a small union-cum-campaigning group for farmers and growers who don\u2019t feel the National Farmers\u2019 Union is right for them. He lets people work for him only if he can pay them the minimum wage; Lloyd himself will make \u00a310,000 in 2109 from working roughly half the year on the business, supplementing that with what he earns from a part-time music career. It\u2019s hard growing crops, he says. It\u2019s more technical than he had imagined and requires a substantial knowledge of plant and soil science, as well as the ability to run the back end of a business. On the whole, answers to problems you encounter tend not to be Googleable. A few weeks ago he was having trouble with his peas; they were yellow, which meant they were lacking in nitrogen, but why would that be when there was plenty of nitrogen in the soil? Eventually he discovered that nitrogen provided in the form of horse manure, as this was, couldn\u2019t be accessed by the peas. He had to save them by mixing compost and manure in water, and adding the solution to the plants. How did he work it out? \u201cI asked a mate,\u201d he says, demonstrating the value of those networks and support organisations. Mutual support, finding ways to help each other, adapting old ways of doing things to work in a new world: these ideas crop up time and time again in these food producers\u2019 conversations, providing ample proof that building a food system creates relationships between people. Sometimes you sense an older, countercultural spirit resurfacing in a new guise. Carol Laslett helps run Street Goat, an organisation that allows communities to work together to run a small herd of milking goats, and hires its billies out to people who need robust grazing on their land (one is currently clearing shrubs at Feed Bristol). Laslett, a veteran of the grow-your-own, self-sufficiency movement of the 1960s and 70s, has a knack of subtly adapting old ways of organising. Street Goat is a cooperative, but that decision was driven not so much by a desire to share the rewards equitably as a recognition that lots of time-starved people could have the contact with animals they craved if they found a way of pooling their scraps of free time. Laslett sees Bristol\u2019s new food movement as a kind of successor, though she\u2019s \u201cnot sure of the scale. Sometimes I think a lot more young people are aware of the issues because of climate change, but then I walk through [Bristol shopping centre] Broadmead and think nothing\u2019s changed.\u201d The quantity of food that Bristol\u2019s farmers could produce is open to question. Certainly, they can\u2019t hope to make the city self-sufficient. To produce all the food that one average meat-eating British adult consumes in a year, you would need about half a hectare of land \u2013 roughly three-quarters of a large football pitch. Bristol covers 11,000 hectares, so even if you could grass down the entire city, it would feed only 14,700 of the 534,000 residents. The area of publicly accessible green space would feed 1,320, and just 3,300 even if they only ate grains. Having said that, self-sufficiency in specific crops might be just about conceivable. The real output of container farms is contested, but using conservative figures of a 38m2 container farm producing a tenth of a hectare\u2019s worth of salad leaves a year, you could meet Bristol\u2019s lettuce needs (6.9m heads a year, using UK average consumption figures) with about 1,000 containers, which, with no space between them, would occupy only about 3.7 hectares. Conventional agricultural analysts tend to dismiss new ideas involving small-scale, local food production, citing population growth rates that, they say, mean the world will need 70% more food by 2050, and pointing out that only large-scale intensive farming could hope to get anywhere near that. They have a point, but their figures overlook, among other things, the vast wastage in the current system, which in 2008 was estimated to be as high as 50%. There could well be a role for more small-scale local production, particularly if the oil supply went awry but, as Venn points out, it isn\u2019t just about the food supply. When looking at cities in this context, she says you start to wonder why we do things the way we do. \u201cWhy are city centres so dominated by concrete, with no community involvement? Why is nature so unwelcome in them? Our cities would be so much more vibrant if we looked at the spaces between buildings in a more meaningful way; those spaces are always the last thing anyone thinks about and we could reverse that, looking at what we need and how we could achieve it by using them. Cities can\u2019t continue to be just about economic growth. They have to be about our health and wellbeing as well.\u201d Of course, the idea of producing food in cities isn\u2019t new and in some ways Bristol could be said to be merely reviving a system of allotments and market gardens that has declined in the past 30 years or so. Nor is it confined to Bristol. There are initiatives in cities across the UK, many adapted to local needs. For example, Bentley Urban Farm near Doncaster has, since it was founded in 2016, worked closely with teenagers who have been excluded from schools, achieving significant improvements in behaviour. The site, Doncaster council\u2019s former horticultural training centre, used to be permanently vandalised, but the excluded children now come to repair it. So could urban farming change the way we live in cities? Or is it destined to be a set of pleasing stories, scraps of bucolic fantasy glimpsed from train windows, or purchased now and again in the form of unusual salads? Sceptics will lean towards the last of these, but it might just be worth reflecting on the origins of our current system. In the 17th and 18th centuries, a number of British farmers such as Jethro Tull of Berkshire and Norfolk\u2019s Charles Townshend, began experimenting with newfangled equipment and techniques such as seed drills, fertiliser use and crop rotations. These were often mocked by their peers, and some caught on while others didn\u2019t. At the same time, successive governments were making it easy for the wealthy to enclose common land. Once you owned or farmed a lot of land, you had an interest in maximising the return from it, which gave you a motivation for trying out those new ideas and using the ones that produced more crops. And thus the form of farming we now know came about, founded on what amounted to massive government intervention, plus ideas developed on little plots of land, by people who some considered impractical if not barmy. Of course, no one knew at the time that Tull, Townshend and the government were inventing modern agriculture, and no one can know now whether some aspect of our food\u2019s future might be being invented at Purple Patch or on an old horticultural training centre in Doncaster. If you walk north from the Bearpit along Gloucester Road, the street at the heart of Bristol\u2019s alternative community, you come to a cafe that would sit nicely in the kind of future people such as Venn and Cracknell are hoping to build. Suncraft, all pared-back and recycled wood, is a vegan cafe run by restaurateur duo James Koch and James Smailes. It\u2019s particularly notable for the glass tank in which 140 salad greens and microherbs are grown hydroponically for use by the chefs \u2013 a consumer-friendly example of the much-heralded climate-controlled container farming, that is also now being taken up by supermarket salad sections. Sitting in Suncraft one morning, Koch looks at the tank and says, \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about what we harvest at the moment, it\u2019s more that it is interesting for us to start thinking about food in this way. Our customers are also fascinated to look at it and to get into a conversation about urban farming.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting take on how all this might play out for customers. Tesco may be stocking an urban mix salad, using leaves from a London hydroponic farm, Waitrose may be planning to put tanks in its salad aisles, but no one\u2019s pretending that there\u2019s huge consumer demand for food grown in cities. Dermot O\u2019Regan, founder of the Grow Bristol urban farming consultancy that installed and manages Suncraft\u2019s tanks, believes urban food will be as important as an educational debate starter as it will a source of food. Having set up, and then sold, one of the country\u2019s first container farms in Bristol in 2015, he\u2019s sceptical about claims that that kind of small-scale production can make money; he just about made money on the quick-growing microgreens, but had he wanted to grow lettuce, he would have had to charge about \u00a320 a head. However, as an entertaining, conversation-starting feature in shops and restaurants, it could be invaluable. \u201cIt gets people to think about where their food is from,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat does natural mean when rural fields might be near roads and all the work in them is done by machinery using oil? Should we be thinking about eating more algae, seaweed and insects? Can people be persuaded to pay for more sustainable food? How can we distribute it to make it as accessible as supermarket food? It opens up all sort of issues, and that\u2019s important. Because whatever you think about urban farming, you can\u2019t really look at the current food system and says that it\u2019s working, can you?\u201d Read more about the future of cities at theguardian.com/cities",

A lot of it became about admiring skill.\u201d</p> <p>Sadly, many of the establishments captured by Crow over the past decade have since closed, sunk by rising rents and business rates, competition from supermarkets and parking restrictions. The threat to independent food retailers is worth fighting, says Crow, \u201cbecause they are something everyone benefits from. They help create the community, they give it a visual presence.

      "bodyText": "A lot of it was based on appearance,\u201d says Eleanor Crow on choosing the food shops and cafes to draw for her new book, Shopfronts of London. To meet her criteria, an establishment would need to have \u201cgreat typography and signage, striking colours, nice tiles, lots of good architectural detail. It would catch my eye as I cycled past and make me want to go back for a proper look.\u201d Crow started drawing shopfronts 10 years ago, building on a love of small retailers going back to her childhood in rural Cornwall and Gloucestershire. It wasn\u2019t merely the eye-catching exteriors that interested her: \u201cI\u2019d go in, buy things and talk to the owners. A lot of it became about admiring skill.\u201d Sadly, many of the establishments captured by Crow over the past decade have since closed, sunk by rising rents and business rates, competition from supermarkets and parking restrictions. The threat to independent food retailers is worth fighting, says Crow, \u201cbecause they are something everyone benefits from. They help create the community, they give it a visual presence. People still appreciate that \u2013 they don\u2019t want to buy everything online.\u201d Lina Stores (above) \u201cMore delicatessen than greengrocer, this Soho establishment was opened in 1944 by Lina, a woman from Genova. Since then, it has established a formidable reputation for quality imported Italian produce sold alongside freshly made pasta and sandwiches. A recent refurbishment retained the historic detailing, while refitting the interior in a complementary modern design.

      "bodyText": "The UK will face a three-month meltdown at its ports, a hard Irish border and shortages of food and medicine if it leaves the EU without a deal, according to government documents on Operation Yellowhammer. The documents predict severe extended delays to medicine supplies and shortages of some fresh foods combined with price rises as a likely scenario if the UK leaves without a withdrawal agreement, which is due to happen on 31 October. They suggest there has been a worsening of the risk since documents leaked to the Guardian showed some of the government\u2019s \u201creasonable worst-case scenarios\u201d (RWCS) involved risk to medicine supplies and disruption to food chains. The dossier, compiled this month, says up to 85% of lorries using the main channel crossings \u201cmay not be ready\u201d for French customs and could face queues of two and a half days, the Sunday Times reported. Medical supplies will be \u201cvulnerable to severe extended delays\u201d as three-quarters of the UK\u2019s medicines enter the country via the main Channel crossings, and the availability of fresh food will be reduced and prices will rise, which could hit \u201cvulnerable groups\u201d. The government also believes the return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would be likely as current plans to avoid widespread checks would prove unsustainable. A senior Whitehall source told the Sunday Times: \u201cThis is not Project Fear, this is the most realistic assessment of what the public face with no deal. These are likely, basic, reasonable scenarios \u2013 not the worst case.\u201d Downing Street sources would not comment on the record about the leaked document but hit back at its accuracy, saying it was prepared under Theresa May\u2019s administration and did not reflect the level of planning that had gone on under Boris Johnson. A No 10 source said: \u201cThis document is from when ministers were blocking what needed to be done to get ready to leave and the funds were not available. It has been deliberately leaked by a former minister in an attempt to influence discussions with EU leaders. \u201cThose obstructing preparation are no longer in government, \u00a32bn of extra funding has already been made available and Whitehall has been stood up to actually do the work through the daily ministerial meetings. The entire posture of government has changed.\u201d Leading pro-Brexit MPs also rejected the predictions made in the document. Two Tory former cabinet ministers, Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, claimed the leak was an example of an \u201cestablishment\u201d plot to \u201csow fear in people\u2019s minds\u201d. On Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, Kwasi Kwarteng, a minister at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said there was \u201ca lot of scaremongering around and a lot of people are playing into Project Fear and all the rest of it\u201d. Johnson insists he still wants the UK to leave with a deal but he has demanded a fresh agreement with the EU without the backstop, a mechanism to prevent a hard border in Ireland that could keep Britain in a customs union. He is due to visit Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, before a G7 summit this week to underline his demands for concessions. However, the EU is adamant that the backstop must stay. With the likelihood of no deal increasing, more than 100 MPs from across the political parties have called on Johnson to recall parliament to allow for debate on Brexit. Moves are under way by Tory rebels along with Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and other MPs to legislate against no deal. If that fails they are working on replacing Johnson with a caretaker government after a vote of no confidence. Johnson\u2019s strategy is to blame parliamentarians for blocking Brexit, before a possible general election that he would fight on a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d platform. In a letter leaked to the Mail on Sunday, Johnson said it was \u201cplain as a pikestaff\u201d that EU leaders would \u201csimply not compromise\u201d and agree to a new deal if Tory MPs openly discussed stopping a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The letter will be seen as an attack on Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, and Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, who are among those leading Tory rebels trying to find ways to stop the government leaving the EU without an agreement. In a letter to 20 Tories who had written to him demanding a deal, Johnson replied: \u201cAny such parliamentary campaign, any tricks of procedure or alliance of factions designed to derail Brexit, gravely damages the chances of our securing a deal.\u201d The government is applying its energies to showing the EU that it is serious about leaving on 31 October with or without a deal.

      "body": "<p>By 7.30am all the cod at Peterhead fish market had been sold, snapped up by competing buyers wearing thick fleeces, woolly hats and rubber boots against the chill of the vast indoor warehouse.</p> <p>A gaggle of middle-aged men clutching books of brightly coloured \u201ctallies\u201d followed the auctioneer alongside crates of glassy-eyed fish nestling in ice. With a curt nod or a swift hand gesture, the price was settled, tallies thrown down to indicate the fish\u2019s new owner, and the group moved on. It took less than 10 minutes to dispose of the night\u2019s catch.</p> <p>Most of the fish would be heading south, to England or mainland Europe. The Scots are not big cod eaters, preferring haddock with their chips. This dates, apparently, from pre-refrigeration days: haddock is a fish best eaten really fresh, whereas cod is tastiest a couple of days after being caught.</p> <p>The Peterhead buyers were cagey about naming their customers, but the fish they purchased was destined for supermarkets, fishmongers, restaurants, and a few of the classic takeaway chippies that are a national institution. But all this could now be under threat: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/29/north-sea-cod-at-critically-low-levels-study-warns\" title=\"\">report published last month</a> by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (Ices) revealed that North Sea cod stocks had fallen to critical levels. Warning that cod was being harvested unsustainably, it recommended a 63% cut in the catch \u2013 and that\u2019s on top of a 47% reduction last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-17T12:26:29/embed.html\" data-alt=\"intercatice\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-17T12:26:29/embed.html\">intercatice</a> </figure>  <p>Independent auditors are reviewing the Ices report, and by late September they will announce whether the fisheries can retain their Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certificates of sustainability \u2013 issued only two years ago \u2013 or whether those certificates will be suspended. Depending on the decision, North Sea cod could soon be off the menu.</p> <p>At Peterhead, Europe\u2019s largest white-fish port, the cod haul was small, perhaps half the amount of the previous night, causing a buyers\u2019 scramble. \u201cIt fluctuates,\u201d said an official, shrugging his shoulders.</p> <p>Stuart Cowie, who has been in the industry for 20 years, said everyone was worried about the Ices advice. \u201cThere are too many merchants and too few fish.\u201d</p> <p>But Will Clark was more sanguine. The managing director of Wilsea had bought 37 boxes of cod that morning, he declared after consulting a small black notebook. The fish would be heading down \u201cthe spine of England\u201d \u2013 the Midlands and London, which were \u201cstrong cod-eating areas\u201d \u2013 and across the Channel.</p> <p>\u201cThe fish will be with my customers by 1am or 2am, and in the shops by 7am or 8am tomorrow. People will be eating it anywhere in Europe by tomorrow lunchtime.\u201d North Sea cod, he said, was \u201cwell managed. All stocks go up and down. It\u2019s a concern, but we\u2019ve been here before.\u201d</p> <p>And indeed we have. North Sea cod stocks were once plentiful but plummeted \u2013 and came perilously close to collapse \u2013 between the early 1970s and 2006. A \u201ccod recovery plan\u201d sought to restore stocks to sustainable levels by limiting fishing days, decommissioning boats, banning catches in nursery areas and putting larger holes in nets to allow young cod to escape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63088881ac89358798d9f0e13b64e26f2172d0bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63088881ac89358798d9f0e13b64e26f2172d0bc/0_211_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fish market trader stands on crates of cod as they sit in ice at Peterhead Fish Market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fish market trader stands on crates of cod as they sit in ice at Peterhead Fish Market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Lloyd/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In what was seen as a significant achievement, the stock rose fourfold between 2006 and 2017, when the MSC \u2013 on whose guidance big retailers and many consumers rely \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.msc.org/media-centre/press-releases/north-sea-cod-certified-as-sustainable\" title=\"\">awarded three fisheries sustainable status</a>. The MSC\u2019s distinctive blue label with a white tick was a huge fillip to the industry.</p> <p>The UK consumes about 115,000 tonnes of cod each year. Only 15,000 tonnes comes from the North Sea, with the rest imported mainly from the fertile grounds in the Barents Sea and around Norway and Iceland. But the species is of huge symbolic importance to the UK fishing industry, which employs about 24,000 people \u2013 more than half of them working in Scotland.</p> <p>Ices, an international organisation of scientists from countries bordering the North Atlantic, advises governments and the industry on stock levels and the sustainable quotas that can be fished without endangering future stocks.</p> <p>It sounded a warning last year with its recommended cut in the cod catch of 47%, but <a href=\"http://ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Advice/2019/2019/cod.27.47d20.pdf\" title=\"\">this year\u2019s assessment</a> \u2013 based on extensive scientific research \u2013 warned that levels were dangerously low and another two-thirds reduction was needed.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unclear what the reasons are for this; further work is required to investigate climate change, biological and fisheries effects,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Environmental organisations point out that cod has been fished above its maximum sustainable yield in recent years, meaning the fish are taken from the sea faster than they can reproduce.</p> <p>The species is not breeding as fast as it used to, too many unwanted \u201cjuvenile\u201d fish are caught, and the practice of \u201cdiscarding\u201d \u2013 throwing dead fish back into the sea to keep within quotas \u2013 continues despite being banned.</p> <p>With the end of the cod recovery plan, fishing vessels are now entering sites that have not been trawled for more than a decade, causing damage to the ecosystem, they say.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a fishery that was on the road to recovery, but failures to reduce fishing pressure have led to serious overfishing and a reversal of fortunes for cod,\u201d said Samuel Stone of the Marine Conservation Society.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very harsh lesson, but this is why we need legally binding commitments to fish at sustainable levels, to effectively monitor our fisheries and to take an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. We have to properly protect our fish stocks for the benefit of our seas, coastal communities and consumers who expect sustainable seafood.\u201d</p> <p>The Marine Conservation Society, WWF and ClientEarth jointly wrote to the environment secretary on the day Ices published its advice, calling on the government to take urgent steps to secure the future of North Sea cod.</p> <p>\u201cAs the country with the largest share [about 40%] of the North Sea cod quota, we require the UK to play a leading role in introducing emergency measures that minimise fishing mortality and maximise spawning potential. Only by doing this will the stock be enabled to recover,\u201d their letter said.</p> <p>Ices is an advisory body with no legal authority. Its advice will be the subject of negotiations between the coastal nations bordering the North Sea to determine the \u201ctotal allowable catch\u201d, or quota, for cod next year.</p> <p>Brexit is a further complicating factor, of course. In the 2016 referendum campaign, the fishing industry became a symbol of the Leave campaign, which claimed it would be a clear beneficiary of its \u201ctake back control\u201d message.</p> <p>The EU common fisheries policy was held up as an example of European bureaucrats dictating to the UK fishing industry what it could and could not do in the country\u2019s coastal waters. But marine experts point out that fish do not respect national boundaries, and therefore the industry needs coordinated international management.</p> <p>\u201cSpecies like cod are \u2018shared stocks\u2019,\u201d said Phil Taylor of Open Seas, which works on protecting and recovering the marine ecosystem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2e6a1ecae857e3b68716f767e4944e1852860d75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e6a1ecae857e3b68716f767e4944e1852860d75/0_62_3008_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The popular meal was described by Winston Churchill as \u201cthe good companions\u201d.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The popular meal was described by Winston Churchill as \u201cthe good companions\u201d.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Langan/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAfter we leave the EU we will have greater control of how fishing takes place at sea. But the buck will then land squarely at the feet of UK and Scottish ministers. We may have greater control, but we will also have greater responsibility and accountability.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be completely within the gift of our ministers \u2013 whether they take a short-term, smash and grab approach to fish stocks or manage these fisheries more fairly to protect the environment and yield the best long-term profit from the system. We require an urgent transition towards more sustainable seafood.\u201d</p> <p>Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen\u2019s Federation, said the industry was \u201c100% committed to sustainable fisheries for the very obvious reason that anything else would spell the end for hundreds of businesses that sustain so many of our coastal communities\u201d.</p> <p>The latest challenge on cod stocks could be overcome by \u201cresponsible, practicable measures\u201d, he added. \u201cIt will not be easy, and many sacrifices will have to be made along the way. But we will succeed, and when this country is no longer in the common fisheries policy we will be able to set our own more meaningful and stringent sustainability goals and ensure that it is our fishing boats that will have first call on quota.\u201d</p> <p>The MSC acknowledged that the drop in cod stocks was \u201cdisappointing news\u201d for the industry. But, said the MSC\u2019s Erin Priddle, \u201cit is imperative that effective measures are introduced to secure long-term sustainability of this iconic and ecologically important fishery \u2026 protecting North Sea cod for this and future generations must be a key priority for all involved\u201d.</p> <p>Consumers, said the MSC, could continue to eat cod it has labelled as sustainable. If the auditors decide next month to suspend the certificates, the change would come into force towards the end of October.</p> <p>The impact of such a move will be felt mainly in supermarkets, fishmongers and restaurants where sustainability is an important factor for conscientious consumers. In the nation\u2019s chippies, 90% of the cod served is imported. \u201cThere will be less UK-caught cod, but even before the Ices advice, we\u2019ve always imported most of the seafood we eat,\u201d said Aoife Martin of Seafish, which supports the UK seafood industry.</p> <p>A \u201chuge variety of amazing seafood species\u201d was caught by UK fishers, she said, but about 80% was exported. Monkfish, scallops, lobster and crab were in demand in Europe and Asia \u2013 \u201cKoreans love UK whelks\u201d \u2013 but \u201ceither we don\u2019t catch the fish we want to eat here in the UK, like tuna, or we don\u2019t catch enough to meet demand, such as cod\u201d.</p> <p>According to the National Federation of Fish Friers, one in five Britons make a weekly trip to the chippie. But big hikes in the price of fish in the past few years are putting the industry under pressure.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day shops are going up for sale. A lot are really struggling, but it\u2019s tight for everyone,\u201d said Andrew Crook, the federation\u2019s president.</p> <p>The first fish and chip shop is believed to have been opened by Joseph Malin, a Jewish immigrant, in east London around 1860. Another businessman, John Lees, is also credited as a fish and chip pioneer, selling the dish from a wooden hut at Mossley market in Lancashire as early as 1863.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4b0b0ea60bb90c4c2997a67d3ecbfbd7a43a56ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b0b0ea60bb90c4c2997a67d3ecbfbd7a43a56ca/0_315_5008_3005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A traditional Friday treat in Salford in 1974.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>A traditional Friday treat in Salford in 1974. </em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It soon caught on. By the 1930s, the number of fish and chip shops across the country had reached about 35,000. In <em>The Road to Wigan Pier</em>, George Orwell credited the ubiquity of much-loved fish and chips as one of the factors in averting revolution.</p> <p>During the second world war, the government ensured that fish and chips were never rationed. Winston Churchill described the constituents of the dish as \u201cthe good companions\u201d.</p> <p>Traditional takeaway fish and chips, seasoned with salt and vinegar and eaten with fingers out of newspaper wrappings, sometimes accompanied by a pickled onion, have long been superseded by polystyrene cartons, plastic forks and sachets of sauce.</p> <p>Now the dish is also served in miniature portions at glamorous parties, and it has a place on the menus of expensive restaurants as well as pubs and seaside cafes.</p> <p>Fish and chips is ingrained in the nation\u2019s identity, said Crook.</p> <p>\u201cYou remember eating fish and chips with your grandparents on the seafront in Blackpool or Margate, but you don\u2019t remember your first kebab. There\u2019s a romance to it, and a sense of theatre, as well as being a comforting and nutritious meal.\u201d</p> <p>The looming Ices decision on cod could, however, take its toll. At a cafe in Peterhead run by the Fishermen\u2019s Mission, Kyle Wood said that if cod was deemed unsustainable, \u201csupermarkets will take it off their shelves\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019ll still be fish and chips, but there\u2019s bound to be an impact on price and availability,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a big struggle for the industry.\u201d</p>",

The Peterhead buyers were cagey about naming their customers, but the fish they purchased was destined for supermarkets, fishmongers, restaurants, and a few of the classic takeaway chippies that are a national institution. But all this could now be under threat: a report published last month by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (Ices) revealed that North Sea cod stocks had fallen to critical levels. Warning that cod was being harvested unsustainably, it recommended a 63% cut in the catch \u2013 and that\u2019s on top of a 47% reduction last year. Independent auditors are reviewing the Ices report, and by late September they will announce whether the fisheries can retain their Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certificates of sustainability \u2013 issued only two years ago \u2013 or whether those certificates will be suspended. Depending on the decision, North Sea cod could soon be off the menu. At Peterhead, Europe\u2019s largest white-fish port, the cod haul was small, perhaps half the amount of the previous night, causing a buyers\u2019 scramble. \u201cIt fluctuates,\u201d said an official, shrugging his shoulders. Stuart Cowie, who has been in the industry for 20 years, said everyone was worried about the Ices advice. \u201cThere are too many merchants and too few fish.\u201d But Will Clark was more sanguine. The managing director of Wilsea had bought 37 boxes of cod that morning, he declared after consulting a small black notebook. The fish would be heading down \u201cthe spine of England\u201d \u2013 the Midlands and London, which were \u201cstrong cod-eating areas\u201d \u2013 and across the Channel. \u201cThe fish will be with my customers by 1am or 2am, and in the shops by 7am or 8am tomorrow. People will be eating it anywhere in Europe by tomorrow lunchtime.\u201d North Sea cod, he said, was \u201cwell managed. All stocks go up and down. It\u2019s a concern, but we\u2019ve been here before.\u201d And indeed we have. North Sea cod stocks were once plentiful but plummeted \u2013 and came perilously close to collapse \u2013 between the early 1970s and 2006. A \u201ccod recovery plan\u201d sought to restore stocks to sustainable levels by limiting fishing days, decommissioning boats, banning catches in nursery areas and putting larger holes in nets to allow young cod to escape. In what was seen as a significant achievement, the stock rose fourfold between 2006 and 2017, when the MSC \u2013 on whose guidance big retailers and many consumers rely \u2013 awarded three fisheries sustainable status. The MSC\u2019s distinctive blue label with a white tick was a huge fillip to the industry. The UK consumes about 115,000 tonnes of cod each year. Only 15,000 tonnes comes from the North Sea, with the rest imported mainly from the fertile grounds in the Barents Sea and around Norway and Iceland. But the species is of huge symbolic importance to the UK fishing industry, which employs about 24,000 people \u2013 more than half of them working in Scotland. Ices, an international organisation of scientists from countries bordering the North Atlantic, advises governments and the industry on stock levels and the sustainable quotas that can be fished without endangering future stocks. It sounded a warning last year with its recommended cut in the cod catch of 47%, but this year\u2019s assessment \u2013 based on extensive scientific research \u2013 warned that levels were dangerously low and another two-thirds reduction was needed. \u201cIt is unclear what the reasons are for this; further work is required to investigate climate change, biological and fisheries effects,\u201d the report said. Environmental organisations point out that cod has been fished above its maximum sustainable yield in recent years, meaning the fish are taken from the sea faster than they can reproduce. The species is not breeding as fast as it used to, too many unwanted \u201cjuvenile\u201d fish are caught, and the practice of \u201cdiscarding\u201d \u2013 throwing dead fish back into the sea to keep within quotas \u2013 continues despite being banned. With the end of the cod recovery plan, fishing vessels are now entering sites that have not been trawled for more than a decade, causing damage to the ecosystem, they say. \u201cThis is a fishery that was on the road to recovery, but failures to reduce fishing pressure have led to serious overfishing and a reversal of fortunes for cod,\u201d said Samuel Stone of the Marine Conservation Society. \u201cIt\u2019s a very harsh lesson, but this is why we need legally binding commitments to fish at sustainable levels, to effectively monitor our fisheries and to take an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. We have to properly protect our fish stocks for the benefit of our seas, coastal communities and consumers who expect sustainable seafood.\u201d The Marine Conservation Society, WWF and ClientEarth jointly wrote to the environment secretary on the day Ices published its advice, calling on the government to take urgent steps to secure the future of North Sea cod. \u201cAs the country with the largest share [about 40%] of the North Sea cod quota, we require the UK to play a leading role in introducing emergency measures that minimise fishing mortality and maximise spawning potential. Only by doing this will the stock be enabled to recover,\u201d their letter said. Ices is an advisory body with no legal authority. Its advice will be the subject of negotiations between the coastal nations bordering the North Sea to determine the \u201ctotal allowable catch\u201d, or quota, for cod next year. Brexit is a further complicating factor, of course. In the 2016 referendum campaign, the fishing industry became a symbol of the Leave campaign, which claimed it would be a clear beneficiary of its \u201ctake back control\u201d message. The EU common fisheries policy was held up as an example of European bureaucrats dictating to the UK fishing industry what it could and could not do in the country\u2019s coastal waters. But marine experts point out that fish do not respect national boundaries, and therefore the industry needs coordinated international management. \u201cSpecies like cod are \u2018shared stocks\u2019,\u201d said Phil Taylor of Open Seas, which works on protecting and recovering the marine ecosystem. \u201cAfter we leave the EU we will have greater control of how fishing takes place at sea. But the buck will then land squarely at the feet of UK and Scottish ministers. We may have greater control, but we will also have greater responsibility and accountability. \u201cIt will be completely within the gift of our ministers \u2013 whether they take a short-term, smash and grab approach to fish stocks or manage these fisheries more fairly to protect the environment and yield the best long-term profit from the system. We require an urgent transition towards more sustainable seafood.\u201d Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen\u2019s Federation, said the industry was \u201c100% committed to sustainable fisheries for the very obvious reason that anything else would spell the end for hundreds of businesses that sustain so many of our coastal communities\u201d. The latest challenge on cod stocks could be overcome by \u201cresponsible, practicable measures\u201d, he added. \u201cIt will not be easy, and many sacrifices will have to be made along the way. But we will succeed, and when this country is no longer in the common fisheries policy we will be able to set our own more meaningful and stringent sustainability goals and ensure that it is our fishing boats that will have first call on quota.\u201d The MSC acknowledged that the drop in cod stocks was \u201cdisappointing news\u201d for the industry. But, said the MSC\u2019s Erin Priddle, \u201cit is imperative that effective measures are introduced to secure long-term sustainability of this iconic and ecologically important fishery \u2026 protecting North Sea cod for this and future generations must be a key priority for all involved\u201d. Consumers, said the MSC, could continue to eat cod it has labelled as sustainable. If the auditors decide next month to suspend the certificates, the change would come into force towards the end of October. The impact of such a move will be felt mainly in supermarkets, fishmongers and restaurants where sustainability is an important factor for conscientious consumers. In the nation\u2019s chippies, 90% of the cod served is imported. \u201cThere will be less UK-caught cod, but even before the Ices advice, we\u2019ve always imported most of the seafood we eat,\u201d said Aoife Martin of Seafish, which supports the UK seafood industry. A \u201chuge variety of amazing seafood species\u201d was caught by UK fishers, she said, but about 80% was exported. Monkfish, scallops, lobster and crab were in demand in Europe and Asia \u2013 \u201cKoreans love UK whelks\u201d \u2013 but \u201ceither we don\u2019t catch the fish we want to eat here in the UK, like tuna, or we don\u2019t catch enough to meet demand, such as cod\u201d. According to the National Federation of Fish Friers, one in five Britons make a weekly trip to the chippie. But big hikes in the price of fish in the past few years are putting the industry under pressure. \u201cEvery day shops are going up for sale. A lot are really struggling, but it\u2019s tight for everyone,\u201d said Andrew Crook, the federation\u2019s president. The first fish and chip shop is believed to have been opened by Joseph Malin, a Jewish immigrant, in east London around 1860. Another businessman, John Lees, is also credited as a fish and chip pioneer, selling the dish from a wooden hut at Mossley market in Lancashire as early as 1863. It soon caught on. By the 1930s, the number of fish and chip shops across the country had reached about 35,000. In The Road to Wigan Pier, George Orwell credited the ubiquity of much-loved fish and chips as one of the factors in averting revolution. During the second world war, the government ensured that fish and chips were never rationed. Winston Churchill described the constituents of the dish as \u201cthe good companions\u201d. Traditional takeaway fish and chips, seasoned with salt and vinegar and eaten with fingers out of newspaper wrappings, sometimes accompanied by a pickled onion, have long been superseded by polystyrene cartons, plastic forks and sachets of sauce. Now the dish is also served in miniature portions at glamorous parties, and it has a place on the menus of expensive restaurants as well as pubs and seaside cafes. Fish and chips is ingrained in the nation\u2019s identity, said Crook. \u201cYou remember eating fish and chips with your grandparents on the seafront in Blackpool or Margate, but you don\u2019t remember your first kebab. There\u2019s a romance to it, and a sense of theatre, as well as being a comforting and nutritious meal.\u201d The looming Ices decision on cod could, however, take its toll. At a cafe in Peterhead run by the Fishermen\u2019s Mission, Kyle Wood said that if cod was deemed unsustainable, \u201csupermarkets will take it off their shelves\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019ll still be fish and chips, but there\u2019s bound to be an impact on price and availability,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a big struggle for the industry.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>The ingredient: sage and onion stuffing</h2> <p><em>By Jack Monroe, food writer and campaigner</em></p> <p>On the top shelf in my kitchen, nestled behind the jars of butterscotch Angel Delight and instant mash, is a pair of jars of pale green breadcrumbs \u2013 24p sage and onion stuffing crumbs. I use them for coating homemade nuggets or fish fingers, padding out meatballs, in a can of tomatoes for a two-ingredient pappa al pomodoro, to top pasta bakes and macaroni, in garlic bread, to make a bread sauce with a flavour bang, mixed with chopped tomatoes for a quick panzanella, and in a five-ingredient nut roast for my vegetarian partner on a Sunday. I buy five boxes at a time and sieve them: fine powder in one jar for breadcrumb coatings, thickening stews and bread making, and the chunkier pieces in another for meatballs, toppings and soups.</p> <h2>The recipe: a most excellent vegetarian roast</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c4aaba2ae5d41745a98bff0776f6d6c4b7e5034\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c4aaba2ae5d41745a98bff0776f6d6c4b7e5034/0_267_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Monroe\u2019s veggie roast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Food styling: Henrietta Clancy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mrs J has been a vegetarian for two decades now and in that period has eaten an inestimable number of nut roasts. She says repeatedly that this is her favourite ever, and I take that as high praise indeed. It\u2019s simple and the apricots can be switched for cranberries for Christmas dinner or other seasonal occasions. Leftovers make excellent stuffing sandwiches, or can be eaten cold with brown sauce and aplomb.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 6, reluctantly, as I can eat the whole thing myself</strong></em><br><strong>onions </strong>2<br><strong>oil </strong>1 tbsp<br><strong>mixed nuts </strong>400g<br><strong>cooked chestnuts or other nuts </strong>200g<br><strong>dried sage and onion stuffing </strong>170g <br><strong>tinned mandarins </strong>240g<br><strong>dried apricots </strong>150g<br></p> <p>Peel and finely slice the onions, then toss them into a wide non-stick pan. Add the oil, season with salt and pepper, and cook on a very low heat on the smallest hob ring for 10 minutes to soften without browning. When gently cooked, remove from the heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl.</p> <p>Finely chop the nuts and chestnuts \u2013 this is easily achieved in a small bullet blender, jug blender or food processor if you have them, but if you don\u2019t, pop them into a sturdy freezer bag and grind with a rolling pin against the work surface. Tip the crushed nuts into the mixing bowl and add the stuffing.</p> <p>Drain the mandarins, reserving the juice in a measuring jug, and tip them into the mix. Mash with a fork and fold them in. Finely chop the apricots and add those, too.</p> <p>Add boiling water to the mandarin juice to make it up to 220ml. Pour it into the mixing bowl and stir well. Leave to stand for 15 minutes for the stuffing to swell as it absorbs the liquid.</p> <p>Lightly grease a 900g loaf tin and scrape the mixture into it, pressing down firmly into the corners to really pack it in. Leave a clear inch from the top of the tin as the roast may rise as it cooks.</p> <p>Place in the centre of the oven at 180C/gas mark 4 and bake for 50 minutes, until the edges are crisp. Leave to stand for 10 minutes to firm up. Serve warm or cold.</p> <h2>The ingredient: seaweed</h2> <p><em>By Nathan Outlaw, chef-owner Restaurant Nathan Outlaw, Port Isaac, Cornwall</em></p> <p>Although it\u2019s thought of as being salty, seaweed is actually a flavour enhancer capable of boosting a seafood dish to a new level. Steaming fish with bladderwrack enhances the ozoney flavour, while powdered sea lettuce or gutweed sprinkled into hollandaise adds an extra dimension to the sauce. I use seaweed that has either been foraged by our chefs or is from the Cornish Seaweed Company.</p> <h2>The recipe: grilled sardines, cucumber salad and seaweed salad cream</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f4be18ae91e520c6f76e86290836e53e1f75997\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f4be18ae91e520c6f76e86290836e53e1f75997/0_146_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Outlaw sardines and seaweed salad cream\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Sardines are delicious and quick to cook. This dish, ideal for summer eating, is simple to prepare under the grill or on the barbecue. If using the barbecue, light it half an hour before cooking so it\u2019s good and hot. Using seaweed to season the salad cream gives an interesting twist.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4<br>For the white wine shallots<br></strong></em><strong>banana shallots</strong> 4 large, peeled<br><strong>white wine</strong> 150ml<br><strong>white wine vinegar</strong> 75ml<br><strong>caster sugar </strong>75g</p> <p><em><strong>For the seaweed salad cream<br></strong></em><strong>egg yolks</strong> 2 large<br><strong>dried seaweed powder</strong> 2 tbsp, or flakes blitzed to a powder<br><strong>English mustard </strong>2 tsp<br><strong>caster sugar </strong>2 tsp<br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 2 tbsp<br><strong>light olive oil </strong>200ml<br><strong>double cream </strong>100ml</p> <p><em><strong>For the cucumber salad<br></strong></em><strong>cucumber </strong>1, peeled<br><strong>small capers in brine</strong> 3 tsp, drained<br><strong>white wine shallots</strong> 2 tsp <br><strong>dill </strong>2 tsp, chopped, plus some sprigs for finishing<br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 4 tsp<br><strong>cold-pressed rapeseed </strong>oil 8 tsp</p> <p><em><strong>For the sardines<br></strong></em><strong>sardines</strong> 20 descaled, gutted and butterflied<br><strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>olive oil to drizzle</strong></p> <p>To make the white wine shallots, finely chop the shallots and place in a clean container. Put the wine, vinegar and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over a medium heat. Add a pinch of salt, then pour the hot pickling liquor over the shallots, making sure they are submerged. Leave to cool, then seal and leave for at least 12 hours before using. The shallots will keep for 3 months in the fridge.</p> <p>To make the salad cream, whisk the first 5 ingredients together in a large bowl for 1 minute, then gradually whisk in the oil until fully incorporated. To finish, slowly whisk in the cream, then season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until required.</p> <p>For the cucumber salad, pare long ribbons from the cucumber using a vegetable peeler until you reach the seeds. Put the ribbons in a bowl with the capers, white wine shallots and dill. Dress with the lemon juice and oil, and toss. Scatter with the reserved dill.</p> <p>Season the sardines with salt and pepper, then brush with olive oil. Place skin-side down on a grill tray or barbecue grid and cook for 3 minutes. Don\u2019t be tempted to move them or you may damage the skin. Carefully turn the sardines over and place on a baking tray. Place the tray under the grill or on the barbecue for 1 minute to finish cooking the fish.</p> <h2>The ingredient: charcoal</h2> <p><em>By Monica Galetti, chef-owner, Mere, London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"42cb4f94c3d5a249434cfd07e2049413e4e14646\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42cb4f94c3d5a249434cfd07e2049413e4e14646/0_213_5571_6960/800.jpg\" alt=\"Monica Galetti\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monica Galetti. Hair and makeup Neusa Neves at Terri Manduca using Nars and Aveda haircare</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I use charcoal in lots of things at Mere, from bread and choux to batters and sauces. I like the shock factor of the intense black colour without it tainting the curry spices, which happens when you use squid ink. The flavour is a mild, smoky curry in contrast to the colour, which makes you think it will be very strong. I grew up with my mother making us curries, so this was inspired by the feelings of comfort from her home cooking, but I wanted to make it my own. My mum\u2019s curries were usually very mild so us kids could enjoy them, but nowadays I absolutely love spicy food. This dish brings together the warming and fragrant flavours reminiscent of my childhood and travels.</p> <h2>The recipe: black curry cod</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d641551ec3f9dc53d7378ddccb1dd55ccd29c41e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d641551ec3f9dc53d7378ddccb1dd55ccd29c41e/42_331_2704_2702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monica Galetti black curry cod\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Serves 4 <br>For the black curry powder<br></strong></em><strong>turmeric powder</strong> 2 tsp<br><strong>cumin powder</strong> 1\u00bd tsp<br><strong>coriander powder</strong> 1\u00bd tsp<br><strong>ground ginger</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>chilli powder</strong> \u00bd tsp<br><strong>fenugreek powder</strong> \u00bd tsp<br><strong>charcoal powde</strong>r 1\u00bd tbsp (available at <a href=\"https://www.souschef.co.uk/products/bamboo-charcoal-powder\">souschef.co.uk</a>)</p> <p><em><strong>For the garnishes<br></strong></em><strong>hazelnuts</strong> 80g<br><strong>black sesame </strong>1 tsp<br><strong>white sesame</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>cumin seeds </strong>\u00bd tsp<br><strong>fennel seeds</strong> \u00bd tsp<br><strong>celery</strong> 2 sticks<br><strong>white balsamic vinegar</strong> 200ml<br><strong>cucumber</strong> \u00bd<br><strong>grapes</strong> 2<br><strong>radishes</strong> 2<br><strong>fresh coriander</strong> to serve</p> <p><em><strong>For the sauce<br></strong></em><strong>shallot</strong> 1<br><strong>olive oil </strong>as needed<br><strong>butter</strong> 50g<br><strong>white wine</strong> 100ml<br><strong>fish stock</strong> 200ml<br><strong>double cream </strong>200ml<br><strong>white miso paste</strong> 50g</p> <p><em><strong>For the cod<br></strong></em><strong>cod fillets </strong>4, 140g each<br><strong>olive oil </strong>as needed<br><strong>cold butter </strong>70g, cubed<br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 clove<br><strong>thyme</strong> 2 sprigs</p> <p>For the charcoal use either bamboo charcoal powder or homemade vegetable coal. To make vegetable coal: preheat the grill to high. Thinly slice one large onion and spread into a single layer on a baking sheet.

I like to finish the dish with some fresh coriander.</p> <h2>The ingredient: smoked sweet paprika</h2> <p><em>By Nieves Barrag\u00e1n Mohacho, chef-director, Sabor, London</em></p> <p>Smoked sweet paprika plays an important role in Spanish cuisine and is used in paella, sauces, marinades, even drinks (one of my favourites being a Spanish version of a bloody mary made with a sherry base). My favourite brand, which we use at Sabor, is La Chinata.</p> <p>I have vivid memories from when I was around eight years old, when my mother used to prepare some of my favourite dishes using smoked sweet paprika. As soon as the spice was added, the room would fill with smoky aromas and a huge grin would spread across my face. I knew a delicious meal was on its way.</p> <p>Whenever I encounter that smell, whether I\u2019m cooking or enjoying a meal out in Spain, I\u2019m taken straight back to my childhood. My parents grew up in C\u00e1ceres in the Extremadura region, where paprika is produced. They later moved to Bilbao, where I was brought up. For a long time we used to travel back every year for our summer vacation.</p> <p>Smoked sweet paprika is fantastic for dishes centred around oily fish such as brill, turbot, lemon sole or mackerel, or in a marinade for pork.</p> <h2>The recipe: whole grilled brill with ajada sauce</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d01eda130846c79e9012b2b263d96ff1fb11ad1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d01eda130846c79e9012b2b263d96ff1fb11ad1/0_977_6192_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Secret Ingredients OFM August 2019 Observer Food Monthly Food styling: Henrietta Clancy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Serves 2<br>For the ajada sauce<br></strong></em><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 100ml<br><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves, thinly sliced<br><strong>moscatel vinegar </strong>40ml<br><strong>lemon juice </strong>10ml<br><strong>smoked sweet paprika</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>chopped parsley</strong> 1 tbsp<br><strong>salt and pepper </strong>to taste</p> <p><em><strong>For the brill<br></strong></em><strong>extra virgin olive oil </strong>50ml<br><strong>brill</strong> 1 whole, around 800g<br><strong>salt and pepper</strong> to taste</p> <p>To make the sauce, warm the oil in a saucepan on a medium to low heat, then add the garlic. When the garlic begins to turn golden brown, add the vinegar and lemon juice, then set aside to cool.</p> <p>Once cool, add the smoked sweet paprika and stir. It is important to wait until cooled, because if the oil is too hot, the paprika will burn and taste bitter. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and add the parsley at the end.</p> <p>To cook the brill, put the oil in a large pan and warm on a medium heat. Season the fish with salt and pepper, then place it in the pan, dark skin side down, and cook for 4-5 minutes.</p> <p>Flip with a large spatula and cook for another 3-4 minutes. If the pan seems very dry and the fish isn\u2019t cooking well, you may need another splash of olive oil.</p> <p>Place the brill on a large plate and pour the ajada sauce on top.</p> <h2>The ingredient: pig\u2019s trotter</h2> <p><em>By Simon Hopkinson, chef</em> <em>and food writer</em></p> <p>Most decent butchers will be able to furnish you with a trotter and will happily split it lengthways in two, then further cleave into 6-8 pieces, so allowing as much gelatine as possible to exude. If you have access to a Chinese supermarket, you will often find an entire trotter, neatly cleaved into 8 perfect pieces, in a film-wrapped carton \u2013 and for almost pence. For me, the inclusion of a trotter transforms stews; I always pop one in braised tripe, too.</p> <p>I have, for many years, believed that chicken joints for a good coq au vin marinated in raw [uncooked] wine overnight will never be rid of alcohol; its strong notes remain in the chicken meat even when cooked, which I find indigestible. So I always pre-cook the wine with herbs and vegetables, together with a pig\u2019s trotter to add richness and body to the eventual braise for the coq.</p> <p>For this initial cooking I use a small pressure cooker, which will extract all the goodness from the trotter in the shortest time \u2013 say, 25 minutes on full pressure. Otherwise, simmer normally for at least an hour, maybe more; the trotter skin and meat should be falling off the bones.</p> <h2>The recipe: coq au vin</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dfe5fc1497d3d009c35938f747874ab2b8899bd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfe5fc1497d3d009c35938f747874ab2b8899bd7/0_113_5851_7309/801.jpg\" alt=\"Coq au Vin Pig\u2019s trotter Simon Hopkinson Secret Ingredients OFM August 2019 Observer Food Monthly Food styling: Henrietta Clancy\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Serves 4<br>For pre-cooking the wine marinade<br></strong></em><strong>decent red wine </strong>1 bottle, preferably pinot noir<br><strong>pig\u2019s trotter </strong>1 small, split lengthways and roughly chopped into 6-8 pieces<br><strong>redcurrant jelly </strong>1 scant tbsp<br><strong>small onion</strong> 1, chopped<br><strong>celery</strong> 2 sticks, chopped<br><strong>carrot</strong> 1, chopped<br><strong>garlic </strong>4 cloves, unpeeled and bruised<br><strong>thyme </strong>3-4 sprigs<br><strong>bay leaves</strong> 2</p> <p><em><strong>For the coq au vin<br></strong></em><strong>olive oil</strong> a trickle<br><strong>pancetta</strong> 1 x 150-175g piece (rind removed and reserved), cut into 1.5cm cubes<br><strong>butter </strong>25g<br><strong>chicken legs </strong>4 large (drumstick and thigh), skin removed<br><strong>flour </strong>2 tbsp<br><strong>shallots</strong> 16-20 small, peeled<br><strong>dark open-cap mushrooms</strong> 12 medium-sized<br><strong>cognac </strong>3 tbsp</p> <p>Put the marinade ingredients into a stainless steel pot together with the reserved pancetta rind and bring up to a simmer. Cover and quietly cook for at least one hour (or follow the pressure cooker method). Strain through a sieve and cool completely. Marinate the chicken pieces in this for at least 5-6 hours or, preferably, overnight.</p> <p>Warm the olive oil in a solid-bottomed pot and gently fry the pancetta until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and reserve. Add the butter to the pot. Season the chicken joints and roll in the flour, then fry until golden brown in the fat and butter. Now remove these, too, and put with the reserved pancetta.</p> <p>Tip the shallots and mushrooms into the pot and gently cook until well coloured \u2013 about 10 minutes. Return the chicken and pancetta to the pot, turn up the heat a touch, pour over the cognac and set it alight. Once the flames have died down, add the wine marinade. Shake everything about a bit, then cover and put on a very low heat. Simmer at the merest blip, covered, for about 45 minutes (or in a medium oven).</p> <p>Serve the coq au vin with boiled or steamed potatoes lubricated with melted butter, then showered with finely chopped parsley.</p> <h2>JUST ADD A LITTLE OF THIS\u2026</h2> <h2>SIX SHORT TIPS FROM TOP CHEFS AND COOKS</h2> <h2>The ingredient: potato</h2> <p><em>By Joe Trivelli, co-head chef at the River Caf\u00e9</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"068f3c559aedb8754887171ae7dc34fcd926e66d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/068f3c559aedb8754887171ae7dc34fcd926e66d/0_226_5315_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"potatoes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When cooking at home, I often add about half a boiled potato to pesto. I use something that\u2019s not waxy, an old potato rather than a new one. The idea came from a colleague of mine, from Genoa, whose mum does it. When I heard that, of course I tried it too. The potato gives body and smoothness, and also goes some way to replacing cheese for vegans. Cheese gives a binding kind of smoothness. So when cooking for vegan mates at home, I put in some potato and a couple of olives too, which gives it saltiness and tanginess.</p> <p>Obviously it\u2019s not going to win any authentic Ligurian pesto prizes; it tastes completely different but it is delicious. Actually, with many pasta dishes, I often cook potato and pasta together, as I like the added starch and the way the oil sticks to the pasta. The other secret ingredient in pesto (which I do do at work) is water - just a couple of tablespoons or if the basil is just really wet from being washed. It stops it becoming too oily and helps it become a sauce. Because I\u2019m pretentious I use filtered water.</p> <h2>The ingredient: soy sauce</h2> <p><em>By Sat Bains, chef-owner at Restaurant Sat Bains, Nottingham</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eb8af506ac72b7c6b56991fa12668d0a8d84697d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8af506ac72b7c6b56991fa12668d0a8d84697d/275_121_1780_3383/526.jpg\" alt=\"Glass bottle of soy sauce\" width=\"526\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In 2016 I was lucky enough to visit Japan and was introduced to this incredible soy sauce company in Akita, which has been around since the 19th-century. It is family-owned and has never before exported. We are the first restaurant to get its soy sauce. It\u2019s beautiful, not too salty with a bit of sweetness and a lot of umami. Every soy sauce is different because they come from different breweries with their own individual processes. At the restaurant, we use it in lots of things \u2013 we can do a soy beurre blanc and when we make a nut-brown butter, a splash of soy adds a lovely layer of saltiness. One of my favourite dishes is something my uncle introduced me to when I was a kid. You get a big piece of deep-fried fish from the chip shop, and put sliced red onions on top and Sarson\u2019s vinegar. I\u2019ve now started adding soy sauce. You get the incredible crispy batter, soft fish, astringent red onion, hint of malt vinegar and the salty soy sauce. Anything you would normally put balsamic vinegar on, use soy too. In a tomato and onion salad, with basil and olive oil, add a little soy and it\u2019s mind blowing.</p> <h2>The ingredient: allspice</h2> <p><em>By Yasmin Khan, food writer</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f2a903b943102cfe47ff2f5cf91417662f5d85dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2a903b943102cfe47ff2f5cf91417662f5d85dc/0_98_4222_2533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Whole allspice berries\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I used to think of allspice as something just to use in cakes or biscuits at Christmas but three years ago when I was travelling around the Middle East researching Zaitoun, my book on Palestinian food, I learned about its incredible application in savoury dishes. It\u2019s a really common spice used in the Levant, in Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese kitchens.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just one thing. When you smell it, you get hints of nutmeg, cinnamon, black pepper and mace. I think that\u2019s why it has the English name allspice. I now use it in everything: from a marinade for barbecued chicken (it\u2019s the key ingredient in jerk) and chickpea stew to salad dressings. I often have it with porridge, too, as it has more notes than cinnamon. It imparts a warmth, a sweetness and a spicy flavour that I can\u2019t get enough of.</p> <h2>The ingredient: yuzu kosho</h2> <p><em>By Alison Roman, cookery writer</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b0d2ebdbefccae700727c73b7517f6bf93b91e36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0d2ebdbefccae700727c73b7517f6bf93b91e36/0_142_3835_2301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yuzu Kosho\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Yuzu kosho is a Japanese chilli paste made by fermenting chillies and the rind of yuzu (a Japanese citrus fruit)with salt. There is green and red yuzu kosho but I prefer the green. It\u2019s not common, definitely not something that\u2019s going be at your everyday supermarket, but you can find it online easily or in a Japanese grocer.</p> <p>I first used it about 16 years ago in Sona in California, the first restaurant I ever worked in. I was on the pastry station at the time and we used it with cherries\u2013 so cherries, sugar and a dab of yuzu kosho. That was a bit of a fancy application, but at home I use it in things like braises and stews or with cold noodles.</p> <p>I really love it with chicken and beef. When braising a whole chicken with vinegar, a tiny bit goes a long way. It\u2019s a very very simple dish but the yuzu kosho makes it special without having to do a ton of work. It\u2019s not something most people are familiar with, so even when you use a little bit it\u2019s a mysterious flavour \u2013 salty, spicy and citrussy, but not quite lemony.</p> <h2>The ingredient: fish sauce</h2> <p><em>By Blanche Vaughan, cookery writer</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2d5a666b83e7cc2a2d9f1a68c71f419aec6aae99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d5a666b83e7cc2a2d9f1a68c71f419aec6aae99/194_36_1378_1722/800.jpg\" alt=\"fish Sauce\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been adding fish sauce to guacamole for years. I have to credit this idea to my friend, Crispin Somervile, who lived in Mexico. The guacamole doesn\u2019t taste of fish sauce but it heightens the flavours of the other ingredients, which is the trick to seasoning - like adding a judicious bit of parmesan. You get these elements you can\u2019t quite put your finger on but everything tastes better.</p> <p>For one avocado, I add a couple of teaspoons, as that\u2019s the main seasoning. I just sort of splash it in to taste. I add a bit of very fresh spring onion, lime obviously, a little fresh chilli and coriander. I don\u2019t like the avocado too mushed up, I like a bit of chunk. Using fish sauce in guacamole did inspire me \u2013 sometimes I\u2019ll put it into a dressing. I love it with a little rice vinegar on salads.</p> <h2>The ingredient: bacon rind</h2> <p><em>By Gill Meller, chef and cookery writer</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ee716fe2a999ea28b1fcb9e05aae3db6c0f0bcf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee716fe2a999ea28b1fcb9e05aae3db6c0f0bcf0/0_115_5891_3536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bacon side\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I add a square of bacon rind to my tomato sauce as it makes it much richer and creamier. I learned this trick years ago from the mother of the food ambassador of Puglia when I was invited to visit the region with a couple of chef friends. One evening the food ambassador, Franco, took us back to his mum\u2019s home and she cooked for us. One of the courses was a pasta dish with this delicious tomato sauce. It was a sauce she made later in the summer when tomatoes were at their ripest, spending three or four days making enough to see her through to the following year. Her secret was to add horsemeat and various kinds of salt-pork trim leftover from making charcuterie. Her passata was cooked long and slow, and left simmering overnight. In the morning, she would take the horsemeat and trimmings out and what was left was this intensely flavoured tomato sauce. My sauce isn\u2019t the same but it is inspired by it. I make it with lots of olive oil and garlic, sometimes adding onions and bay leaves, the best quality tinned tomatoes I can get hold of, a little bit of sugar, quite a lot of salt, black pepper and a bit of rind. I would probably use a few strips - pieces of skin, not so much the rind that comes from rashers. Most butchers who cure their own bacon will be able to sell or maybe even give you the rind.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The ingredient: sage and onion stuffing By Jack Monroe, food writer and campaigner On the top shelf in my kitchen, nestled behind the jars of butterscotch Angel Delight and instant mash, is a pair of jars of pale green breadcrumbs \u2013 24p sage and onion stuffing crumbs. I use them for coating homemade nuggets or fish fingers, padding out meatballs, in a can of tomatoes for a two-ingredient pappa al pomodoro, to top pasta bakes and macaroni, in garlic bread, to make a bread sauce with a flavour bang, mixed with chopped tomatoes for a quick panzanella, and in a five-ingredient nut roast for my vegetarian partner on a Sunday. I buy five boxes at a time and sieve them: fine powder in one jar for breadcrumb coatings, thickening stews and bread making, and the chunkier pieces in another for meatballs, toppings and soups. The recipe: a most excellent vegetarian roast Mrs J has been a vegetarian for two decades now and in that period has eaten an inestimable number of nut roasts. She says repeatedly that this is her favourite ever, and I take that as high praise indeed. It\u2019s simple and the apricots can be switched for cranberries for Christmas dinner or other seasonal occasions. Leftovers make excellent stuffing sandwiches, or can be eaten cold with brown sauce and aplomb. Serves 6, reluctantly, as I can eat the whole thing myself onions 2 oil 1 tbsp mixed nuts 400g cooked chestnuts or other nuts 200g dried sage and onion stuffing 170g tinned mandarins 240g dried apricots 150g Peel and finely slice the onions, then toss them into a wide non-stick pan. Add the oil, season with salt and pepper, and cook on a very low heat on the smallest hob ring for 10 minutes to soften without browning. When gently cooked, remove from the heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Finely chop the nuts and chestnuts \u2013 this is easily achieved in a small bullet blender, jug blender or food processor if you have them, but if you don\u2019t, pop them into a sturdy freezer bag and grind with a rolling pin against the work surface. Tip the crushed nuts into the mixing bowl and add the stuffing. Drain the mandarins, reserving the juice in a measuring jug, and tip them into the mix. Mash with a fork and fold them in. Finely chop the apricots and add those, too. Add boiling water to the mandarin juice to make it up to 220ml. Pour it into the mixing bowl and stir well. Leave to stand for 15 minutes for the stuffing to swell as it absorbs the liquid. Lightly grease a 900g loaf tin and scrape the mixture into it, pressing down firmly into the corners to really pack it in. Leave a clear inch from the top of the tin as the roast may rise as it cooks. Place in the centre of the oven at 180C/gas mark 4 and bake for 50 minutes, until the edges are crisp. Leave to stand for 10 minutes to firm up. Serve warm or cold. The ingredient: seaweed By Nathan Outlaw, chef-owner Restaurant Nathan Outlaw, Port Isaac, Cornwall Although it\u2019s thought of as being salty, seaweed is actually a flavour enhancer capable of boosting a seafood dish to a new level. Steaming fish with bladderwrack enhances the ozoney flavour, while powdered sea lettuce or gutweed sprinkled into hollandaise adds an extra dimension to the sauce. I use seaweed that has either been foraged by our chefs or is from the Cornish Seaweed Company. The recipe: grilled sardines, cucumber salad and seaweed salad cream Sardines are delicious and quick to cook. This dish, ideal for summer eating, is simple to prepare under the grill or on the barbecue. If using the barbecue, light it half an hour before cooking so it\u2019s good and hot. Using seaweed to season the salad cream gives an interesting twist. Serves 4 For the white wine shallots banana shallots 4 large, peeled white wine 150ml white wine vinegar 75ml caster sugar 75g For the seaweed salad cream egg yolks 2 large dried seaweed powder 2 tbsp, or flakes blitzed to a powder English mustard 2 tsp caster sugar 2 tsp lemon juice 2 tbsp light olive oil 200ml double cream 100ml For the cucumber salad cucumber 1, peeled small capers in brine 3 tsp, drained white wine shallots 2 tsp dill 2 tsp, chopped, plus some sprigs for finishing lemon juice 4 tsp cold-pressed rapeseed oil 8 tsp For the sardines sardines 20 descaled, gutted and butterflied salt and freshly ground black pepper olive oil to drizzle To make the white wine shallots, finely chop the shallots and place in a clean container. Put the wine, vinegar and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over a medium heat. Add a pinch of salt, then pour the hot pickling liquor over the shallots, making sure they are submerged. Leave to cool, then seal and leave for at least 12 hours before using. The shallots will keep for 3 months in the fridge. To make the salad cream, whisk the first 5 ingredients together in a large bowl for 1 minute, then gradually whisk in the oil until fully incorporated. To finish, slowly whisk in the cream, then season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until required. For the cucumber salad, pare long ribbons from the cucumber using a vegetable peeler until you reach the seeds. Put the ribbons in a bowl with the capers, white wine shallots and dill. Dress with the lemon juice and oil, and toss. Scatter with the reserved dill. Season the sardines with salt and pepper, then brush with olive oil. Place skin-side down on a grill tray or barbecue grid and cook for 3 minutes. Don\u2019t be tempted to move them or you may damage the skin. Carefully turn the sardines over and place on a baking tray. Place the tray under the grill or on the barbecue for 1 minute to finish cooking the fish. The ingredient: charcoal By Monica Galetti, chef-owner, Mere, London I use charcoal in lots of things at Mere, from bread and choux to batters and sauces. I like the shock factor of the intense black colour without it tainting the curry spices, which happens when you use squid ink. The flavour is a mild, smoky curry in contrast to the colour, which makes you think it will be very strong. I grew up with my mother making us curries, so this was inspired by the feelings of comfort from her home cooking, but I wanted to make it my own. My mum\u2019s curries were usually very mild so us kids could enjoy them, but nowadays I absolutely love spicy food. This dish brings together the warming and fragrant flavours reminiscent of my childhood and travels. The recipe: black curry cod Serves 4 For the black curry powder turmeric powder 2 tsp cumin powder 1\u00bd tsp coriander powder 1\u00bd tsp ground ginger 1 tsp chilli powder \u00bd tsp fenugreek powder \u00bd tsp charcoal powder 1\u00bd tbsp (available at souschef.co.uk) For the garnishes hazelnuts 80g black sesame 1 tsp white sesame 1 tsp cumin seeds \u00bd tsp fennel seeds \u00bd tsp celery 2 sticks white balsamic vinegar 200ml cucumber \u00bd grapes 2 radishes 2 fresh coriander to serve For the sauce shallot 1 olive oil as needed butter 50g white wine 100ml fish stock 200ml double cream 200ml white miso paste 50g For the cod cod fillets 4, 140g each olive oil as needed cold butter 70g, cubed garlic 1 clove thyme 2 sprigs For the charcoal use either bamboo charcoal powder or homemade vegetable coal. To make vegetable coal: preheat the grill to high. Thinly slice one large onion and spread into a single layer on a baking sheet. Place under a hot grill, turning occasionally until dry and completely blackened. This should take about 15 minutes. Remove and cool completely, then grind to a powder in a spice mill or pestle and mortar. For the hazelnut garnish, heat a non-stick pan, add the nuts and colour gently all over, add the sesame and spices, and heat together for 2 minutes without burning. Cool then crush roughly in a pestle and mortar and set aside. Peel the celery sticks and cut into batons about 1cm thick. Leave to pickle in the white balsamic vinegar for 20 minutes. Peel and deseed the cucumber, then cut into 2cm thick pieces. Season with salt and pepper, and colour with a blowtorch or in a hot pan and set aside. Slice the grapes into circles and set aside. Slice the radishes thinly and keep on ice. To make the sauce, peel and cut the shallot in half, then slice thinly. Heat a saucepan with a little olive oil, add the butter and cook the shallot to colour. Add the wine and reduce to a third. Add the fish stock, bring it to a boil and reduce by half. Add the cream and bring the mix to a boil, whisk in the miso and pass through a strainer. To cook the cod, season the fillets with a pinch of salt. Heat an ovenproof non-stick pan and add a little oil. Place the fillets skin-side down and cook on medium heat for about 2 minutes, then place the pan in the oven at 180C/gas mark 4 for 2-3 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a small saucepan with 70g butter until foaming. Crush the garlic clove and add to the butter with the thyme. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the black curry powder. Remove the fish from the oven and pour this butter over and continue basting on a medium heat for 1-2 minutes. Serve with the charred cucumber, pickled celery, grapes and radishes sprinkled around the plate and dress with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. Spoon on some of the hazelnut mix. Serve the sauce on the side. I like to finish the dish with some fresh coriander. The ingredient: smoked sweet paprika By Nieves Barrag\u00e1n Mohacho, chef-director, Sabor, London Smoked sweet paprika plays an important role in Spanish cuisine and is used in paella, sauces, marinades, even drinks (one of my favourites being a Spanish version of a bloody mary made with a sherry base). My favourite brand, which we use at Sabor, is La Chinata. I have vivid memories from when I was around eight years old, when my mother used to prepare some of my favourite dishes using smoked sweet paprika. As soon as the spice was added, the room would fill with smoky aromas and a huge grin would spread across my face. I knew a delicious meal was on its way. Whenever I encounter that smell, whether I\u2019m cooking or enjoying a meal out in Spain, I\u2019m taken straight back to my childhood. My parents grew up in C\u00e1ceres in the Extremadura region, where paprika is produced. They later moved to Bilbao, where I was brought up. For a long time we used to travel back every year for our summer vacation. Smoked sweet paprika is fantastic for dishes centred around oily fish such as brill, turbot, lemon sole or mackerel, or in a marinade for pork. The recipe: whole grilled brill with ajada sauce Serves 2 For the ajada sauce extra virgin olive oil 100ml garlic 2 cloves, thinly sliced moscatel vinegar 40ml lemon juice 10ml smoked sweet paprika 1 tsp chopped parsley 1 tbsp salt and pepper to taste For the brill extra virgin olive oil 50ml brill 1 whole, around 800g salt and pepper to taste To make the sauce, warm the oil in a saucepan on a medium to low heat, then add the garlic. When the garlic begins to turn golden brown, add the vinegar and lemon juice, then set aside to cool. Once cool, add the smoked sweet paprika and stir. It is important to wait until cooled, because if the oil is too hot, the paprika will burn and taste bitter. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and add the parsley at the end. To cook the brill, put the oil in a large pan and warm on a medium heat. Season the fish with salt and pepper, then place it in the pan, dark skin side down, and cook for 4-5 minutes. Flip with a large spatula and cook for another 3-4 minutes. If the pan seems very dry and the fish isn\u2019t cooking well, you may need another splash of olive oil. Place the brill on a large plate and pour the ajada sauce on top. The ingredient: pig\u2019s trotter By Simon Hopkinson, chef and food writer Most decent butchers will be able to furnish you with a trotter and will happily split it lengthways in two, then further cleave into 6-8 pieces, so allowing as much gelatine as possible to exude. If you have access to a Chinese supermarket, you will often find an entire trotter, neatly cleaved into 8 perfect pieces, in a film-wrapped carton \u2013 and for almost pence. For me, the inclusion of a trotter transforms stews; I always pop one in braised tripe, too. I have, for many years, believed that chicken joints for a good coq au vin marinated in raw [uncooked] wine overnight will never be rid of alcohol; its strong notes remain in the chicken meat even when cooked, which I find indigestible. So I always pre-cook the wine with herbs and vegetables, together with a pig\u2019s trotter to add richness and body to the eventual braise for the coq. For this initial cooking I use a small pressure cooker, which will extract all the goodness from the trotter in the shortest time \u2013 say, 25 minutes on full pressure. Otherwise, simmer normally for at least an hour, maybe more; the trotter skin and meat should be falling off the bones. The recipe: coq au vin Serves 4 For pre-cooking the wine marinade decent red wine 1 bottle, preferably pinot noir pig\u2019s trotter 1 small, split lengthways and roughly chopped into 6-8 pieces redcurrant jelly 1 scant tbsp small onion 1, chopped celery 2 sticks, chopped carrot 1, chopped garlic 4 cloves, unpeeled and bruised thyme 3-4 sprigs bay leaves 2 For the coq au vin olive oil a trickle pancetta 1 x 150-175g piece (rind removed and reserved), cut into 1.5cm cubes butter 25g chicken legs 4 large (drumstick and thigh), skin removed flour 2 tbsp shallots 16-20 small, peeled dark open-cap mushrooms 12 medium-sized cognac 3 tbsp Put the marinade ingredients into a stainless steel pot together with the reserved pancetta rind and bring up to a simmer. Cover and quietly cook for at least one hour (or follow the pressure cooker method). Strain through a sieve and cool completely. Marinate the chicken pieces in this for at least 5-6 hours or, preferably, overnight. Warm the olive oil in a solid-bottomed pot and gently fry the pancetta until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and reserve. Add the butter to the pot. Season the chicken joints and roll in the flour, then fry until golden brown in the fat and butter. Now remove these, too, and put with the reserved pancetta. Tip the shallots and mushrooms into the pot and gently cook until well coloured \u2013 about 10 minutes. Return the chicken and pancetta to the pot, turn up the heat a touch, pour over the cognac and set it alight. Once the flames have died down, add the wine marinade. Shake everything about a bit, then cover and put on a very low heat. Simmer at the merest blip, covered, for about 45 minutes (or in a medium oven). Serve the coq au vin with boiled or steamed potatoes lubricated with melted butter, then showered with finely chopped parsley. JUST ADD A LITTLE OF THIS\u2026 SIX SHORT TIPS FROM TOP CHEFS AND COOKS The ingredient: potato By Joe Trivelli, co-head chef at the River Caf\u00e9 When cooking at home, I often add about half a boiled potato to pesto. I use something that\u2019s not waxy, an old potato rather than a new one. The idea came from a colleague of mine, from Genoa, whose mum does it. When I heard that, of course I tried it too. The potato gives body and smoothness, and also goes some way to replacing cheese for vegans. Cheese gives a binding kind of smoothness. So when cooking for vegan mates at home, I put in some potato and a couple of olives too, which gives it saltiness and tanginess. Obviously it\u2019s not going to win any authentic Ligurian pesto prizes; it tastes completely different but it is delicious. Actually, with many pasta dishes, I often cook potato and pasta together, as I like the added starch and the way the oil sticks to the pasta. The other secret ingredient in pesto (which I do do at work) is water - just a couple of tablespoons or if the basil is just really wet from being washed. It stops it becoming too oily and helps it become a sauce. Because I\u2019m pretentious I use filtered water. The ingredient: soy sauce By Sat Bains, chef-owner at Restaurant Sat Bains, Nottingham In 2016 I was lucky enough to visit Japan and was introduced to this incredible soy sauce company in Akita, which has been around since the 19th-century. It is family-owned and has never before exported. We are the first restaurant to get its soy sauce. It\u2019s beautiful, not too salty with a bit of sweetness and a lot of umami. Every soy sauce is different because they come from different breweries with their own individual processes. At the restaurant, we use it in lots of things \u2013 we can do a soy beurre blanc and when we make a nut-brown butter, a splash of soy adds a lovely layer of saltiness. One of my favourite dishes is something my uncle introduced me to when I was a kid. You get a big piece of deep-fried fish from the chip shop, and put sliced red onions on top and Sarson\u2019s vinegar. I\u2019ve now started adding soy sauce. You get the incredible crispy batter, soft fish, astringent red onion, hint of malt vinegar and the salty soy sauce. Anything you would normally put balsamic vinegar on, use soy too. In a tomato and onion salad, with basil and olive oil, add a little soy and it\u2019s mind blowing. The ingredient: allspice By Yasmin Khan, food writer I used to think of allspice as something just to use in cakes or biscuits at Christmas but three years ago when I was travelling around the Middle East researching Zaitoun, my book on Palestinian food, I learned about its incredible application in savoury dishes. It\u2019s a really common spice used in the Levant, in Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese kitchens. It\u2019s not just one thing. When you smell it, you get hints of nutmeg, cinnamon, black pepper and mace. I think that\u2019s why it has the English name allspice. I now use it in everything: from a marinade for barbecued chicken (it\u2019s the key ingredient in jerk) and chickpea stew to salad dressings. I often have it with porridge, too, as it has more notes than cinnamon. It imparts a warmth, a sweetness and a spicy flavour that I can\u2019t get enough of. The ingredient: yuzu kosho By Alison Roman, cookery writer Yuzu kosho is a Japanese chilli paste made by fermenting chillies and the rind of yuzu (a Japanese citrus fruit)with salt. There is green and red yuzu kosho but I prefer the green. It\u2019s not common, definitely not something that\u2019s going be at your everyday supermarket, but you can find it online easily or in a Japanese grocer. I first used it about 16 years ago in Sona in California, the first restaurant I ever worked in. I was on the pastry station at the time and we used it with cherries\u2013 so cherries, sugar and a dab of yuzu kosho. That was a bit of a fancy application, but at home I use it in things like braises and stews or with cold noodles. I really love it with chicken and beef. When braising a whole chicken with vinegar, a tiny bit goes a long way. It\u2019s a very very simple dish but the yuzu kosho makes it special without having to do a ton of work. It\u2019s not something most people are familiar with, so even when you use a little bit it\u2019s a mysterious flavour \u2013 salty, spicy and citrussy, but not quite lemony. The ingredient: fish sauce By Blanche Vaughan, cookery writer I\u2019ve been adding fish sauce to guacamole for years. I have to credit this idea to my friend, Crispin Somervile, who lived in Mexico. The guacamole doesn\u2019t taste of fish sauce but it heightens the flavours of the other ingredients, which is the trick to seasoning - like adding a judicious bit of parmesan. You get these elements you can\u2019t quite put your finger on but everything tastes better. For one avocado, I add a couple of teaspoons, as that\u2019s the main seasoning. I just sort of splash it in to taste. I add a bit of very fresh spring onion, lime obviously, a little fresh chilli and coriander. I don\u2019t like the avocado too mushed up, I like a bit of chunk. Using fish sauce in guacamole did inspire me \u2013 sometimes I\u2019ll put it into a dressing. I love it with a little rice vinegar on salads. The ingredient: bacon rind By Gill Meller, chef and cookery writer I add a square of bacon rind to my tomato sauce as it makes it much richer and creamier. I learned this trick years ago from the mother of the food ambassador of Puglia when I was invited to visit the region with a couple of chef friends. One evening the food ambassador, Franco, took us back to his mum\u2019s home and she cooked for us. One of the courses was a pasta dish with this delicious tomato sauce. It was a sauce she made later in the summer when tomatoes were at their ripest, spending three or four days making enough to see her through to the following year. Her secret was to add horsemeat and various kinds of salt-pork trim leftover from making charcuterie. Her passata was cooked long and slow, and left simmering overnight. In the morning, she would take the horsemeat and trimmings out and what was left was this intensely flavoured tomato sauce. My sauce isn\u2019t the same but it is inspired by it. I make it with lots of olive oil and garlic, sometimes adding onions and bay leaves, the best quality tinned tomatoes I can get hold of, a little bit of sugar, quite a lot of salt, black pepper and a bit of rind. I would probably use a few strips - pieces of skin, not so much the rind that comes from rashers. Most butchers who cure their own bacon will be able to sell or maybe even give you the rind.",

Not as far as I know.\u201d</p> <p>Martin clearly loves these moments of intense interaction with the material.

It was long before the existence of the TV series, when <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> was just beginning to take off and \u201cthey all broke into a Spanish version of [a song from the books] The Bear and the Maiden Fair.

In my 20s I spent a fair amount of time on one of the main sites dedicated to the books, and one of the things that most filled me with jealousy reading far away in England were the breathless reports from the Brotherhood Without Banners, a small group of devoted fans who would go to conventions, meet GRRM (as they referred to him), share drinks and, if they were lucky, get knighted by him, sometimes it seemed with breadsticks.</p> <p>There is an air of melancholy when he talks about that time now. \u201cWhen I first went to a Brotherhood Without Banners party there would be a few dozen people there, and I became quite friendly with some of them,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd every time I attended I would meet new ones and spend time with them and run trivia contests for them. It was great but, as the books became more and more successful and then the show became a hit, so the parties became bigger and bigger and more and more crowded.\u201d</p> <p>He looks wistful. \u201cThey still have those parties and they\u2019re still great, and I\u2019m still friendly with the people I met back in 2001 and 2002, but I can\u2019t meet the new people any more because there are too many. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re just as delightful as the old people, but I don\u2019t want to go to a party where an unending succession of people want to take selfies with me, because that\u2019s not fun the way it was in the old days.

The bestselling author of the Song of Ice and Fire saga, the books that became television phenomenon Game of Thrones, is in London for a talk with historian Dan Jones about his most recent work, Fire and Blood, an imagined history of the Targaryen family (the all-conquering ancestors of dragon queen Daenerys), before heading to the science-fiction event Worldcon in Dublin. Yet, at the back of his mind, is the work still to come. The Winds of Winter, the sixth and penultimate book in Ice and Fire, has to be finished and the seventh, A Dream of Spring, to be written. Then there\u2019s a couple of Dunk and Egg stories set in the same world to complete. (Lighter in tone, he saw them as palate cleansers between \u201cthe big mega-books\u201d but then \u201cfell behind with everything, so now I\u2019m just trying to think about the next thing immediately in front of me\u201d.)

Such weariness is fleeting, however. Before we meet, I\u2019m told there are certain things Martin won\u2019t discuss: the controversial ending of the television series earlier this year; when The Winds of Winter will arrive; and his health \u2013 he is 70 and the internet is full of speculation about whether he will manage to finish his epic tale.

It\u2019s 2012, there\u2019s \u201ca twinkle in the London Eye\u201d and the city is alive with the celebratory and inclusive spirit of the Olympics. (Eerie, too, how <em>this</em> recent history feels like a bygone age.) Arnstein\u2019s difficulties in cracking the industry are summed up by the three comments she still gets about being an actor: that it\u2019s one step away from prostitution, that surely she means \u201cactress\u201d, and what famous shows has she been in? She learns how selling fragrances can be one step away from escorting, that character descriptions tersely consider a 29-year-old woman \u201cpast her prime\u201d and, to her grandad\u2019s chagrin, that she can\u2019t just enlist for EastEnders the way he did for the navy.</p> <p>But the strongest sections consider the way novice actors \u201clearn and yearn to say yes\u201d because the competition is cut-throat and job insecurity makes it hard to say no. Arnstein reads out the sort of sexist casting call notes famously railed against by Rose McGowan (who is at Edinburgh this year with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/01/rose-mcgowan-edinburgh-harvey-weinstein-me-too\">her own one-woman show</a>) and in the most excruciating episode recreates an audition where she is asked to redo a scene in increasing levels of undress. Arnstein moves on to the next chapter of her story, regaining her composure, but her face is still flushed, the trauma clearly still raw.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sexy Lamp is at the <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/sexy-lamp\">Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</a>, until 26 August.

It\u2019s 2012, there\u2019s \u201ca twinkle in the London Eye\u201d and the city is alive with the celebratory and inclusive spirit of the Olympics. (Eerie, too, how this recent history feels like a bygone age.) Arnstein\u2019s difficulties in cracking the industry are summed up by the three comments she still gets about being an actor: that it\u2019s one step away from prostitution, that surely she means \u201cactress\u201d, and what famous shows has she been in? She learns how selling fragrances can be one step away from escorting, that character descriptions tersely consider a 29-year-old woman \u201cpast her prime\u201d and, to her grandad\u2019s chagrin, that she can\u2019t just enlist for EastEnders the way he did for the navy. But the strongest sections consider the way novice actors \u201clearn and yearn to say yes\u201d because the competition is cut-throat and job insecurity makes it hard to say no. Arnstein reads out the sort of sexist casting call notes famously railed against by Rose McGowan (who is at Edinburgh this year with her own one-woman show) and in the most excruciating episode recreates an audition where she is asked to redo a scene in increasing levels of undress. Arnstein moves on to the next chapter of her story, regaining her composure, but her face is still flushed, the trauma clearly still raw. Sexy Lamp is at the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 26 August. Then at Upstairs at the Western, Leicester, 12-13 September. Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.",

She had gone back into the National Centre For No-Deal Planning, having forgotten her mobile phone, and swiftly secreted herself under a desk when she heard strange snuffling coming from a frosted-glass side room. She pressed her phone up to the opaque window and I listened in.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou must do it, Michael,\u201d said a voice, that of Turds Johnson. \u201cYou are in charge of no-deal planning.

And then Tallulah\u2019s phone went dead.</p> \n<p>As the sun rose on Thursday, I watched Breakfast TV and hoped she would call again. Bumboys, Gove and Cumming appeared bleary-eyed at a press conference. Cumming had a brown mouth and sticky hands and he kept sucking his fingers when he thought no one was looking. Gove goved silently into the distance, like a shell-shocked air-man. Boris stepped forward and proudly announced that, in an all-night strategy session, great strides had been made in no-deal planning.</p> \n<p><em>Stewart Lee\u2019s new stand</em><em>up show, <a href=\"https://www.stewartlee.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Snowflake/Tornado</a>, is at the Leicester Square theatre, London from 29 October to 25 January</em><em> 2020, with national dates to follow</em></p>",

It\u2019s almost as if there is one law for upper-class Conservative drug-dabbling MPs and another for working-class drug mules. During his prison visit, Watermelon was photogenically amused, for the benefit of the compliant press and the gullible public, by an x-ray showing how anally inserted Kinder \u2122 egg interiors can be used to smuggle into prison everything from tobacco and drugs to mobile phone parts. Kinder \u2122 egg suppositories are already responsible for a greater flow of goods annually than the government\u2019s botched Brexit ferry scheme. If I was prime minister, on seeing the anal Kinder \u2122 x-ray, I would have said: \u201cIt gives a whole new meaning to the words \u2018Kinder Surprise \u2122\u2019!\u201d The electorate would have thought I was hilarious, but Wall-Spaffer appeared to have missed the magic moment and blown it. Later on I would come to realise that his magpie mind had merely moved on to other things. On Thursday morning at 12.30am, Tallulah texted me again. She had gone back into the National Centre For No-Deal Planning, having forgotten her mobile phone, and swiftly secreted herself under a desk when she heard strange snuffling coming from a frosted-glass side room. She pressed her phone up to the opaque window and I listened in. \u201cYou must do it, Michael,\u201d said a voice, that of Turds Johnson. \u201cYou are in charge of no-deal planning. We need to test my plan and I can\u2019t let anyone find out about it. You are my most loyal servant.\u201d \u201cI am so not, Boris!\u201d It was Michael Gove, squealing as he spoke. \u201cI stabbed you in the back, remember? Why do I have to do this? Can\u2019t Cumming do it? It is undignified. May I remind you that I am the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster?\u201d Suddenly there was a loud slurping. \u201cCumming,\u201d Letterbox exploded, \u201cyou can\u2019t eat Vaseline \u00ae, man. It\u2019s not a food. Put the lid back on.\u201d Dominic Cumming\u2019s musical and mellifluous voice protested: \u201cBut Vaseline \u00ae is delicious, Boris. I ate it in Russia every day and it kept me warm, like a Bovril made of grease. It is wrong treacle, old Popeye Cumming\u2019s petroleum spinach. And anyway, it\u2019s all over my hands now. So I can just lick it off, whether you like it or not. Besides which, Boris, we may all have to develop a taste for non-standard foods, like Vaseline \u00ae, or insects, in the darkness before the New Dawn.\u201d \u201cStop eating the Vaseline \u00ae, Cumming!\u201d It was Spunk-Burster again. \u201cEat up all the Kinder \u2122 chocolate. We need to dispose of the evidence. No one must know my plan.\u201d Then Gove appeared to be shouting, something about how he now realised from personal experience how important it was to reach a deal. And then Tallulah\u2019s phone went dead. As the sun rose on Thursday, I watched Breakfast TV and hoped she would call again. Bumboys, Gove and Cumming appeared bleary-eyed at a press conference. Cumming had a brown mouth and sticky hands and he kept sucking his fingers when he thought no one was looking. Gove goved silently into the distance, like a shell-shocked air-man. Boris stepped forward and proudly announced that, in an all-night strategy session, great strides had been made in no-deal planning.

      "body": "<p>\u201cI tried to remember as much as possible,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/joanna-hogg\" title=\"\">Joanna Hogg</a>, the English writer and director, about her new autobiographical film, <em>The Souvenir</em> \u2013 her fourth feature. \u201cI found it hard to give up on the illusion that I could remember everything.\u201d She regrets the gaps, and yet the truth of her story may go beyond faithful record. It is about a relationship she had in the 80s, when she was in her 20s and at film school (she is 59 now), with a Cambridge-educated man (outstandingly played by Tom Burke) who claimed to work for the Foreign Office. He was arrogant, amusing, laconic. And \u2013 although not immediately apparent \u2013 vulnerable.</p> <p>The film, with Martin Scorsese as one of its executive producers, has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/28/the-souvenir-review-joanna-hogg-honor-swinton-byrne\" title=\"\">won the grand jury prize at Sundance and had rave reviews</a>. The <em>New York Times</em>\u2019 critic described it as a movie he feels possessive about, confessing that he wanted to \u201ckeep it a secret because it feels like a private discovery\u201d. He concluded that it is: \u201cOne of the saddest movies you can imagine and an absolute joy to watch.\u201d I felt similarly, emerging from the cinema dazed, heartbroken and wanting to see the film again to reconsider what I\u2019d just witnessed.</p> <p>Hogg comes from a privileged, upper-middle-class background \u2013 privately educated at West Heath boarding school in Kent (Princess Diana\u2019s alma mater). And \u2013 should one be seeking further aristocratic flourishes, it might be noted that the associate producer on <em>The Souvenir</em> is her cousin the Baronet of Belfield. Yet the interest of this artistically is that Hogg is correctly seen as a social realist \u2013 not least as someone who knows how mercilessly and accurately to scrutinise her own class.</p> <p>Sitting next to Hogg today \u2013 we\u2019re meeting in Soho \u2013 is Honor Swinton Byrne, the 21-year-old who plays Joanna (\u201cJulie\u201d) in the film. She last appeared in a documentary in homage to the late John Berger, <a href=\"https://seasonsinquincy.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Seasons in Quincy</em></a>. We see her in that film as a free-spirited teenager, with her twin brother, Xavier, picking raspberries in Haute-Savoie. She is the daughter of Tilda Swinton (who was a friend of Berger\u2019s) and the playwright and artist John Byrne and is immediately winning and effusively intelligent. Her flawless performance in <em>The Souvenir</em> does not seem like a performance and \u2013 this is the extraordinary thing \u2013 she had not been planning to act at all. I suppose you could say, with Swinton as a mother and Hogg as a godmother, she was an actor waiting to happen.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTw1WGy0WyA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WTw1WGy0WyA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTw1WGy0WyA\">Watch a trailer for The Souvenir.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Something clicked in me and I started to think: could she possibly be right for this part?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Swinton and Hogg met when they were 11 (their parents were friends). The women drifted apart when Swinton went to Cambridge and Hogg was working as a photographer\u2019s assistant (Derek Jarman was one of Hogg\u2019s early mentors). The friendship was rekindled when Hogg was at the National Film School and cast Swinton in her student movie <em>The Rehearsal</em>. They have been close friends ever since, and it was no surprise Hogg should ask Swinton to suggest a suitable lead for <em>The Souvenir</em>. The only problem was that all the actors she saw were, inevitably, actors. Hogg was looking for someone more like herself, with an incipient shyness, who would be happier behind the camera than in front of it. She and Swinton continued to rack their brains until the moment \u2013 the 11th hour \u2013 when they saw that the person they were looking for had been there all along.</p> <p>\u201cThis was two years ago,\u201d Byrne explains. \u201cI was 19 and about to come back to London after a visit to my grandfather. I got a text from Mum saying Joanna [who had been staying with Swinton in Scotland] would like to see me.\u201d Ostensibly, this was just for a godmother-goddaughter catchup, but actually it was a chance for Hogg to think about Byrne in the film. \u201cWe met in a cafe in Berwick-upon-Tweed for about an hour and Joanna did not discuss the film. We left without paying and someone ran after us \u2013 that was really bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember that,\u201d Hogg says. \u201cWhat I remember is our conversation on the station platform in which you were talking about what it was to be 19 and about relationships. It was in the space of 10 minutes \u2013 something clicked in me and I started to think, could she possibly be right for this part?\u201d Hogg has form casting non-actors (painter Christopher Baker in <em>Archipelago</em>; musician Viv Albertine and conceptual artist Liam Gillick in <em>Exhibition</em>). What\u2019s more, she valued Honor\u2019s creativity (\u201cHonor writes,\u201d she adds, approvingly). \u201cBut I needed time. I wasn\u2019t ready to jump in. I wasn\u2019t sure it was something she\u2019d be interested in, and didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p> <p>Three weeks later, when she did, Byrne remembers: \u201cIt was an immediate \u2018yes\u2019; there was not a doubt in my mind.\u201d She had just left school. \u201cI\u2019d absolutely no idea what I\u2019d do, except I knew I was going to Namibia for eight months.\u201d As a way of filling the remaining time in a gap year, starring in Hogg\u2019s film was irresistible. Byrne had a fortnight between agreeing to take the part and the start of filming. <em>The Souvenir</em> was shot in seven weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e2e7bfee68394da0e2d0e9577a618e2432e8b39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e2e7bfee68394da0e2d0e9577a618e2432e8b39/0_202_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Burke and Honor Swinton Byrne in The Souvenir.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Burke and Honor Swinton Byrne in The Souvenir.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bbc Films/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The casting was a gamble, not least because of Hogg\u2019s way of working. Her films \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/19/drama1\" title=\"\"><em>Unrelated</em></a> (2007), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/03/archipelago-review\" title=\"\"><em>Archipelago</em></a> (2010) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/27/exhibition-review-joanna-hogg-uncomfortably-frank\" title=\"\"><em>Exhibition</em></a> (2013) \u2013 evolve partly through improvisation; there is no conventional script. Hogg knows the power of the unsaid (and unsayable) and of the process of trying to find the words you need. <em>Unrelated</em> begins in sociable aimlessness on an Italian holiday that becomes subtly desolating. <em>Archipelago</em>, about a family reunion on Tresco in the Isles of Scilly, involves much revealing family small talk and a particularly squally undertow between siblings, and <em>Exhibition</em>, set in London, is almost scriptless, more about space than words, about how a struggling couple occupy an architecturally designed house they plan to sell.</p> <p>The challenge (and joy) of Hogg\u2019s films is that she is as interested in what does not happen as what does. Artfully unposed moments are her forte. Her indifference to incident-rich narratives means that her films tend to divide critical opinion. If <em>The Souvenir</em> has a powerful narrative \u2013 and it does \u2013 it is because life supplied it. She is like a dreamier, melancholy, middle-class version of Mike Leigh, improvising her way to the heart of things. But she is her own woman, too.</p> <p>In <em>The Souvenir</em>, Hogg wanted some phrases included, but otherwise, as Swinton recently observed: \u201cJoanna makes authors of all of us.\u201d Tom Burke knew something of what to expect \u2013 he had months to think about his role. But before filming, Byrne did not know what the outcome of any scene would be. She made it up as she went along, which explains the hesitancy that is the film\u2019s hallmark, along with its wonderful, offbeat and realistic dialogue, filled with what would have been casualties in an ordinary screenplay. </p> <p>\u201cThere is so much adrenaline,\u201d Byrne explains. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to unfold, I don\u2019t know how to digest information and react as Julie. And by now, I don\u2019t know where Julie begins and Honor ends \u2013 she\u2019s become my alter ego and I love that.\u201d All Byrne had to go on were Hogg\u2019s 1980s journals, and she identified with their uncertainties: \u201cEvery single person,\u201d she says, \u201cin their early 20s, does not know what is going on in their life. You\u2019re trying to find out what you\u2019re good at, who you are, what you want, what your boundaries are. And you make mistakes and have self-confidence issues. Doing this film comforted me because I didn\u2019t feel so alone. It reassured me it is OK to feel a little bit lost and not know what is going on, and stick with your truth.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some of what you\u2019re touching upon is tricky territory that we have been trying to explore</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hogg first thought of making a film about the relationship three years after it ended and envisaged it in two parts: \u201cA relationship and a reaction to its ending.\u201d But it took 30 years before she found the confidence, in 2015, to pursue the project. Today (they have just finished filming the second part, which should be released early next year), Hogg sits listening to Byrne with an encouraging smile. She is elegant, gentle and wears clothes that give nothing away \u2013 a white T-shirt, simple jewellery. Getting a sense of her is not straightforward. As a young woman, she was \u201chesitant but also very confident \u2013 you can be both\u201d. And if she had to pick three adjectives to sum herself up? \u201cBrave, insecure, optimistic.\u201d She explores the paradoxical feeling that she is no longer the same person she once was, while, at the same time, acknowledging that her \u201cinvestigation into my former self\u201d made her realise \u201cpeople do not change much\u201d.</p> <p>Byrne now pitches into the three-adjectives-to-describe-yourself game: \u201cEnthusiastic, impatient (she drums playfully painted fingernails \u2013 red, yellow and blue \u2013 on the table), self-doubting.\u201d She stalls before landing on a rule-breaking fourth: \u201cEmpathetic \u2013 I hope.\u201d We talk about the tension between revelation and concealment in the film and she pounces on the subject, insisting \u201cprivacy\u201d is key and that \u201cwe all have separate selves\u201d. \u201cDifferent selves for different people,\u201d Hogg chimes in. To help with revelation, Hogg built a reconstruction of her former flat in Knightsbridge as a set, based on a photograph. It became her \u201ctalisman\u201d and worked like \u201cmagic\u201d: \u201cBuilding that space built memories \u2013 so much came back, standing in that newly reconstructed flat.\u201d </p> <p>Remembering sometimes leads to reassessment: why did she stay in the relationship with \u201cAnthony\u201d for so long? She raises her hands in surrender: \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to answer that. Why are we who we are? Some of what you\u2019re touching on is tricky territory that we have been trying to explore in part two.\u201d And did Anthony actually work for the Foreign Office? Her answer startles: \u201cI do not know.\u201d And what of the <a href=\"https://www.wallacecollection.org/support-us/fragonard-research-wallace-collection/\" title=\"\">Fragonard painting <em>The Souvenir</em> (1775-78)</a> that hangs in the Wallace Collection and is the film\u2019s symbolic heart \u2013 was that an artistic afterthought? \u201cNo, it was a key part of the relationship.\u201d In the film, Anthony and Julie visit the gallery and talk about the small painting of a woman dressed in rhubarb-coloured silk, with an about-to-be stormy sky behind her. She carves her lover\u2019s initials into a tree. She leans into the tree to prop herself, a stance that might bode badly. A faithful spaniel looks on intently. And Anthony tells Julie his view of her: \u201cYou\u2019re lost and you will always be lost.\u201d</p> <p>At film school, Julie is advised by a tutor to find links with her own experience to underpin her films. It is a version of \u201cwrite what you know\u201d. Yet Hogg is interested in \u201chaving an idea and not knowing how to realise it\u201d. She films what she knows \u2013 and does not know, because she is trying to find out. \u201cThat relationship was surrounded by doubt and mystery and not knowing; in some senses, I\u2019m none the wiser now.\u201d And explanation has never been her thing? She does not deny it, and laughs.</p> <p>The film raises questions about narrative ownership. It asks us to consider whether it is acceptable for an upper-middle-class young woman, living in Knightsbridge, to want to make (as Hogg did) a film about a Sunderland mining community. And is it any more acceptable for her to tell the true story of a complex man from her past? Hogg\u2019s sense of social irony is hyperdeveloped. Yet the film\u2019s power is in reaching beyond such considerations. \u201cMy conclusion, unlike the one Julie reaches,\u201d Hogg says, \u201cis that we should be able to tell whatever stories we like and be free to talk about anything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d3c29dd34f2ef8b04dd39e4a89db41ab1f0e2489\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3c29dd34f2ef8b04dd39e4a89db41ab1f0e2489/0_489_5780_7222/800.jpg\" alt=\"Joanna Hogg and Honor Swinton Byrne.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joanna Hogg and Honor Swinton Byrne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Swinton plays Julie\u2019s mother, Rosalind, in the film. \u201cIt was the happiest thing to work with my mum,\u201d Byrne says. \u201cIt came naturally. But it was hilarious, because our relationship on screen was so different to our real relationship.\u201d She and her mother have \u201calways been physically affectionate and close\u201d, so playing the daughter of a standoffish, upper-crust mother with a silk headscarf, who wonders, in an early encounter, where to place a new lamp and nurses a \u201cshopping headache\u201d was drastically different. \u201cWe\u2019d cuddle between takes, it was so much fun.\u201d And it was easy to work with Hogg \u201cbecause we\u2019re so similar\u201d. Hogg pitches in to say she loves to work in what feels like a family: \u201cTilda and I couldn\u2019t believe we hadn\u2019t worked together for 30 years. It was so easy and delightful.\u201d</p> <p>Byrne was brought up in the Highlands. She attended Drumduan, a test-free school her mother co-founded in 2013. Her childhood was \u201cthe happiest\u201d, she says. It sounds idyllic. Two frolicking dogs in the film are recruits from the Swinton household. And as memory has been the undertow to our conversation, I ask Byrne what her inner snapshots of childhood are. She immediately singles out the Easter egg hunts. \u201cMum gets those tiny Lindt coloured eggs, about 300 of them \u2013 more every year \u2013 and hides them in tree branches, in the dogs\u2019 ears, drops them on the ground\u2026 we never find them all.\u201d She relates her earliest memory: \u201cI was in an old-fashioned pram with my brother, and Mum was pushing us. Because the sun was behind our heads, it cast a shadow. I thought: there\u2019s another one of us. Like our doppelganger. I watched until I realised that, as the sun went down, the shadow was becoming fainter.\u201d</p> <p>And has her brother Xavier so far managed to avoid being cast in anything? Byrne explains that he works in the art department on films (he worked on <em>Star Wars</em>). \u201cHe is also a pilot and I love him so much, we\u2019re best friends. But I remember that \u2013 he will kill me when he reads this \u2013 when I came back from shooting the first film, he said: \u2018Where have you been for two months?\u2019 And I said: \u2018I told you I\u2019ve shot this amazing film.\u2019 And he went: \u2018Oh, were you a runner?\u2019\u201d</p> <p><em>The Souvenir</em> was shot chronologically on Super16 and it is interesting to see how it liberates Hogg to talk about the filming process. She is animatedly at home: \u201cThe creative pleasures of Super16 are to do with limitation. Each reel is 11 minutes long. Digital can go on ad infinitum and there is something uninteresting about that. I absolutely love that, with Super16, you can\u2019t waste time.\u201d She loves the \u201ctexture and grain\u201d filming this way. She relishes the \u201ceconomy\u201d and \u201cdiscipline\u201d. Her work in television (she did not make her first feature film until she was 47) must have been a schooling in concision. When they shot <em>The Souvenir</em> digitally, she says, the effects were \u201cmuch cooler\u201d. </p> <p>Until now, Hogg has protected herself from reactions to part one because: \u201cI wanted to start filming part two unencumbered \u2013 it starts a couple of days after part one ends and continues into the future, from 1985 until the end of the decade. It will be the continuation \u2013 the beginning in some ways \u2013 of a young artist\u2019s journey to express herself.\u201d The filming was \u201can intense six and a half weeks\u201d and she now has a handful of months to edit. <em>The Souvenir</em> might sound like an ending, but to Hogg there is, I suspect, no such thing. For Byrne, this is a beginning. She is off to Edinburgh Napier to study forensic psychology, and while it seems unlikely that after her uncommon debut she will continue as an ordinary student, she is, without even a hint of disingenuousness, not taking anything for granted. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling anything out,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m excited to try everything.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Souvenir is in cinemas 30 August</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI tried to remember as much as possible,\u201d says Joanna Hogg, the English writer and director, about her new autobiographical film, The Souvenir \u2013 her fourth feature. \u201cI found it hard to give up on the illusion that I could remember everything.\u201d She regrets the gaps, and yet the truth of her story may go beyond faithful record. It is about a relationship she had in the 80s, when she was in her 20s and at film school (she is 59 now), with a Cambridge-educated man (outstandingly played by Tom Burke) who claimed to work for the Foreign Office. He was arrogant, amusing, laconic. And \u2013 although not immediately apparent \u2013 vulnerable. The film, with Martin Scorsese as one of its executive producers, has already won the grand jury prize at Sundance and had rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 critic described it as a movie he feels possessive about, confessing that he wanted to \u201ckeep it a secret because it feels like a private discovery\u201d. He concluded that it is: \u201cOne of the saddest movies you can imagine and an absolute joy to watch.\u201d I felt similarly, emerging from the cinema dazed, heartbroken and wanting to see the film again to reconsider what I\u2019d just witnessed. Hogg comes from a privileged, upper-middle-class background \u2013 privately educated at West Heath boarding school in Kent (Princess Diana\u2019s alma mater). And \u2013 should one be seeking further aristocratic flourishes, it might be noted that the associate producer on The Souvenir is her cousin the Baronet of Belfield. Yet the interest of this artistically is that Hogg is correctly seen as a social realist \u2013 not least as someone who knows how mercilessly and accurately to scrutinise her own class. Sitting next to Hogg today \u2013 we\u2019re meeting in Soho \u2013 is Honor Swinton Byrne, the 21-year-old who plays Joanna (\u201cJulie\u201d) in the film. She last appeared in a documentary in homage to the late John Berger, The Seasons in Quincy. We see her in that film as a free-spirited teenager, with her twin brother, Xavier, picking raspberries in Haute-Savoie. She is the daughter of Tilda Swinton (who was a friend of Berger\u2019s) and the playwright and artist John Byrne and is immediately winning and effusively intelligent. Her flawless performance in The Souvenir does not seem like a performance and \u2013 this is the extraordinary thing \u2013 she had not been planning to act at all. I suppose you could say, with Swinton as a mother and Hogg as a godmother, she was an actor waiting to happen. Swinton and Hogg met when they were 11 (their parents were friends). The women drifted apart when Swinton went to Cambridge and Hogg was working as a photographer\u2019s assistant (Derek Jarman was one of Hogg\u2019s early mentors). The friendship was rekindled when Hogg was at the National Film School and cast Swinton in her student movie The Rehearsal. They have been close friends ever since, and it was no surprise Hogg should ask Swinton to suggest a suitable lead for The Souvenir. The only problem was that all the actors she saw were, inevitably, actors. Hogg was looking for someone more like herself, with an incipient shyness, who would be happier behind the camera than in front of it. She and Swinton continued to rack their brains until the moment \u2013 the 11th hour \u2013 when they saw that the person they were looking for had been there all along. \u201cThis was two years ago,\u201d Byrne explains. \u201cI was 19 and about to come back to London after a visit to my grandfather. I got a text from Mum saying Joanna [who had been staying with Swinton in Scotland] would like to see me.\u201d Ostensibly, this was just for a godmother-goddaughter catchup, but actually it was a chance for Hogg to think about Byrne in the film. \u201cWe met in a cafe in Berwick-upon-Tweed for about an hour and Joanna did not discuss the film. We left without paying and someone ran after us \u2013 that was really bad.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember that,\u201d Hogg says. \u201cWhat I remember is our conversation on the station platform in which you were talking about what it was to be 19 and about relationships. It was in the space of 10 minutes \u2013 something clicked in me and I started to think, could she possibly be right for this part?\u201d Hogg has form casting non-actors (painter Christopher Baker in Archipelago; musician Viv Albertine and conceptual artist Liam Gillick in Exhibition). What\u2019s more, she valued Honor\u2019s creativity (\u201cHonor writes,\u201d she adds, approvingly). \u201cBut I needed time. I wasn\u2019t ready to jump in. I wasn\u2019t sure it was something she\u2019d be interested in, and didn\u2019t ask.\u201d Three weeks later, when she did, Byrne remembers: \u201cIt was an immediate \u2018yes\u2019; there was not a doubt in my mind.\u201d She had just left school. \u201cI\u2019d absolutely no idea what I\u2019d do, except I knew I was going to Namibia for eight months.\u201d As a way of filling the remaining time in a gap year, starring in Hogg\u2019s film was irresistible. Byrne had a fortnight between agreeing to take the part and the start of filming. The Souvenir was shot in seven weeks. The casting was a gamble, not least because of Hogg\u2019s way of working. Her films \u2013 Unrelated (2007), Archipelago (2010) and Exhibition (2013) \u2013 evolve partly through improvisation; there is no conventional script. Hogg knows the power of the unsaid (and unsayable) and of the process of trying to find the words you need. Unrelated begins in sociable aimlessness on an Italian holiday that becomes subtly desolating. Archipelago, about a family reunion on Tresco in the Isles of Scilly, involves much revealing family small talk and a particularly squally undertow between siblings, and Exhibition, set in London, is almost scriptless, more about space than words, about how a struggling couple occupy an architecturally designed house they plan to sell. The challenge (and joy) of Hogg\u2019s films is that she is as interested in what does not happen as what does. Artfully unposed moments are her forte. Her indifference to incident-rich narratives means that her films tend to divide critical opinion. If The Souvenir has a powerful narrative \u2013 and it does \u2013 it is because life supplied it. She is like a dreamier, melancholy, middle-class version of Mike Leigh, improvising her way to the heart of things. But she is her own woman, too. In The Souvenir, Hogg wanted some phrases included, but otherwise, as Swinton recently observed: \u201cJoanna makes authors of all of us.\u201d Tom Burke knew something of what to expect \u2013 he had months to think about his role. But before filming, Byrne did not know what the outcome of any scene would be. She made it up as she went along, which explains the hesitancy that is the film\u2019s hallmark, along with its wonderful, offbeat and realistic dialogue, filled with what would have been casualties in an ordinary screenplay. \u201cThere is so much adrenaline,\u201d Byrne explains. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to unfold, I don\u2019t know how to digest information and react as Julie. And by now, I don\u2019t know where Julie begins and Honor ends \u2013 she\u2019s become my alter ego and I love that.\u201d All Byrne had to go on were Hogg\u2019s 1980s journals, and she identified with their uncertainties: \u201cEvery single person,\u201d she says, \u201cin their early 20s, does not know what is going on in their life. You\u2019re trying to find out what you\u2019re good at, who you are, what you want, what your boundaries are. And you make mistakes and have self-confidence issues. Doing this film comforted me because I didn\u2019t feel so alone. It reassured me it is OK to feel a little bit lost and not know what is going on, and stick with your truth.\u201d Hogg first thought of making a film about the relationship three years after it ended and envisaged it in two parts: \u201cA relationship and a reaction to its ending.\u201d But it took 30 years before she found the confidence, in 2015, to pursue the project. Today (they have just finished filming the second part, which should be released early next year), Hogg sits listening to Byrne with an encouraging smile. She is elegant, gentle and wears clothes that give nothing away \u2013 a white T-shirt, simple jewellery. Getting a sense of her is not straightforward. As a young woman, she was \u201chesitant but also very confident \u2013 you can be both\u201d. And if she had to pick three adjectives to sum herself up? \u201cBrave, insecure, optimistic.\u201d She explores the paradoxical feeling that she is no longer the same person she once was, while, at the same time, acknowledging that her \u201cinvestigation into my former self\u201d made her realise \u201cpeople do not change much\u201d. Byrne now pitches into the three-adjectives-to-describe-yourself game: \u201cEnthusiastic, impatient (she drums playfully painted fingernails \u2013 red, yellow and blue \u2013 on the table), self-doubting.\u201d She stalls before landing on a rule-breaking fourth: \u201cEmpathetic \u2013 I hope.\u201d We talk about the tension between revelation and concealment in the film and she pounces on the subject, insisting \u201cprivacy\u201d is key and that \u201cwe all have separate selves\u201d. \u201cDifferent selves for different people,\u201d Hogg chimes in. To help with revelation, Hogg built a reconstruction of her former flat in Knightsbridge as a set, based on a photograph. It became her \u201ctalisman\u201d and worked like \u201cmagic\u201d: \u201cBuilding that space built memories \u2013 so much came back, standing in that newly reconstructed flat.\u201d Remembering sometimes leads to reassessment: why did she stay in the relationship with \u201cAnthony\u201d for so long? She raises her hands in surrender: \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to answer that. Why are we who we are? Some of what you\u2019re touching on is tricky territory that we have been trying to explore in part two.\u201d And did Anthony actually work for the Foreign Office? Her answer startles: \u201cI do not know.\u201d And what of the Fragonard painting The Souvenir (1775-78) that hangs in the Wallace Collection and is the film\u2019s symbolic heart \u2013 was that an artistic afterthought? \u201cNo, it was a key part of the relationship.\u201d In the film, Anthony and Julie visit the gallery and talk about the small painting of a woman dressed in rhubarb-coloured silk, with an about-to-be stormy sky behind her. She carves her lover\u2019s initials into a tree. She leans into the tree to prop herself, a stance that might bode badly. A faithful spaniel looks on intently. And Anthony tells Julie his view of her: \u201cYou\u2019re lost and you will always be lost.\u201d At film school, Julie is advised by a tutor to find links with her own experience to underpin her films. It is a version of \u201cwrite what you know\u201d. Yet Hogg is interested in \u201chaving an idea and not knowing how to realise it\u201d. She films what she knows \u2013 and does not know, because she is trying to find out. \u201cThat relationship was surrounded by doubt and mystery and not knowing; in some senses, I\u2019m none the wiser now.\u201d And explanation has never been her thing? She does not deny it, and laughs. The film raises questions about narrative ownership. It asks us to consider whether it is acceptable for an upper-middle-class young woman, living in Knightsbridge, to want to make (as Hogg did) a film about a Sunderland mining community. And is it any more acceptable for her to tell the true story of a complex man from her past? Hogg\u2019s sense of social irony is hyperdeveloped. Yet the film\u2019s power is in reaching beyond such considerations. \u201cMy conclusion, unlike the one Julie reaches,\u201d Hogg says, \u201cis that we should be able to tell whatever stories we like and be free to talk about anything.\u201d Swinton plays Julie\u2019s mother, Rosalind, in the film. \u201cIt was the happiest thing to work with my mum,\u201d Byrne says. \u201cIt came naturally. But it was hilarious, because our relationship on screen was so different to our real relationship.\u201d She and her mother have \u201calways been physically affectionate and close\u201d, so playing the daughter of a standoffish, upper-crust mother with a silk headscarf, who wonders, in an early encounter, where to place a new lamp and nurses a \u201cshopping headache\u201d was drastically different. \u201cWe\u2019d cuddle between takes, it was so much fun.\u201d And it was easy to work with Hogg \u201cbecause we\u2019re so similar\u201d. Hogg pitches in to say she loves to work in what feels like a family: \u201cTilda and I couldn\u2019t believe we hadn\u2019t worked together for 30 years. It was so easy and delightful.\u201d Byrne was brought up in the Highlands. She attended Drumduan, a test-free school her mother co-founded in 2013. Her childhood was \u201cthe happiest\u201d, she says. It sounds idyllic. Two frolicking dogs in the film are recruits from the Swinton household. And as memory has been the undertow to our conversation, I ask Byrne what her inner snapshots of childhood are. She immediately singles out the Easter egg hunts. \u201cMum gets those tiny Lindt coloured eggs, about 300 of them \u2013 more every year \u2013 and hides them in tree branches, in the dogs\u2019 ears, drops them on the ground\u2026 we never find them all.\u201d She relates her earliest memory: \u201cI was in an old-fashioned pram with my brother, and Mum was pushing us. Because the sun was behind our heads, it cast a shadow. I thought: there\u2019s another one of us. Like our doppelganger. I watched until I realised that, as the sun went down, the shadow was becoming fainter.\u201d And has her brother Xavier so far managed to avoid being cast in anything? Byrne explains that he works in the art department on films (he worked on Star Wars). \u201cHe is also a pilot and I love him so much, we\u2019re best friends. But I remember that \u2013 he will kill me when he reads this \u2013 when I came back from shooting the first film, he said: \u2018Where have you been for two months?\u2019 And I said: \u2018I told you I\u2019ve shot this amazing film.\u2019 And he went: \u2018Oh, were you a runner?\u2019\u201d The Souvenir was shot chronologically on Super16 and it is interesting to see how it liberates Hogg to talk about the filming process. She is animatedly at home: \u201cThe creative pleasures of Super16 are to do with limitation. Each reel is 11 minutes long. Digital can go on ad infinitum and there is something uninteresting about that. I absolutely love that, with Super16, you can\u2019t waste time.\u201d She loves the \u201ctexture and grain\u201d filming this way. She relishes the \u201ceconomy\u201d and \u201cdiscipline\u201d. Her work in television (she did not make her first feature film until she was 47) must have been a schooling in concision. When they shot The Souvenir digitally, she says, the effects were \u201cmuch cooler\u201d. Until now, Hogg has protected herself from reactions to part one because: \u201cI wanted to start filming part two unencumbered \u2013 it starts a couple of days after part one ends and continues into the future, from 1985 until the end of the decade. It will be the continuation \u2013 the beginning in some ways \u2013 of a young artist\u2019s journey to express herself.\u201d The filming was \u201can intense six and a half weeks\u201d and she now has a handful of months to edit. The Souvenir might sound like an ending, but to Hogg there is, I suspect, no such thing. For Byrne, this is a beginning. She is off to Edinburgh Napier to study forensic psychology, and while it seems unlikely that after her uncommon debut she will continue as an ordinary student, she is, without even a hint of disingenuousness, not taking anything for granted. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling anything out,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m excited to try everything.\u201d The Souvenir is in cinemas 30 August",

But it transcends its labels: it\u2019s about genius and mental illness and history and love \u2013 and Newman lays in several solutions to her puzzle without ever privileging one. The line by line writing is masterful \u2013 crisp and surprising without ever feeling effortful \u2013 but what moved me the most was how suffused with grief the whole book is; a constant, aching undercurrent of sadness about the roads not travelled and the things we lose.</p> <h2>3.

      "bodyText": "Writer and theatre director Robert Icke was born in Stockton-on-Tees and educated at the University of Cambridge. Since 2013, he has been associate director of the Almeida theatre in London, where his productions have included adaptations of the Oresteia (2015), for which he won best director at the 2016 Olivier awards, Uncle Vanya (2016) and Hamlet (2017). Icke will step down from the role later this year; his final production is The Doctor, an adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler\u2019s Professor Bernhardi starring Juliet Stevenson, which will run until 28 September. 1. Documentary OJ: Made in America I missed this when it was televised, but caught up with it recently and was blown away. It\u2019s a documentary about the 1995 murder trial of OJ Simpson, but what\u2019s extraordinary is the way it stitches that trial deep into the centre of American culture and its relationships to race and to celebrity \u2013 and the way the context and the event interact with each other. Exceptionally well constructed with total integrity by Ezra Edelman, it attains, in its painstaking, austere way, a kind of tragic grandeur without ever asking us to sympathise with its subject. 2. Novel The Heavens by Sandra Newman I finished this a few days ago and haven\u2019t quite pulled it down into sense yet. Trying to describe it makes it sound a bit unbearable: \u201ca time-travelling love story that has Shakespeare as a speaking character\u201d. But it transcends its labels: it\u2019s about genius and mental illness and history and love \u2013 and Newman lays in several solutions to her puzzle without ever privileging one. The line by line writing is masterful \u2013 crisp and surprising without ever feeling effortful \u2013 but what moved me the most was how suffused with grief the whole book is; a constant, aching undercurrent of sadness about the roads not travelled and the things we lose. 3. Place Monet\u2019s Gardens at Giverny Monet first rented this house in Giverny (about an hour\u2019s train ride from Paris) in 1883, bought it in 1890 and died in it in 1926. Inspired by Japanese prints, he spent those years landscaping the gardens, creating the famous waterlily pond \u2013 and then obsessively painting them. I love spending time there \u2013 and am always moved and inspired by how much Monet did to create the conditions he needed to make his work. The gardens themselves are reflective, peaceful and beautiful, more so for being manmade: brought into being purely to be captured for ever in paint. 4. Music Dinu Lipatti \u2013 The Last Recital I\u2019ve recently been playing my way through Chopin\u2019s waltzes \u2013 and for my money there\u2019s no better interpreter than the Romanian pianist Dinu Lipatti, who played concerts of them out of sequence \u2013 in his own idiosyncratic order. This recording is of his final concerts, given while in ill health and less than two months before his death in 1950, aged only 33. Though the recording quality is fuzzy, the clarity and dynamism of his playing slice across the intervening half-century. 5. Art Duncan MacAskill I\u2019ve never met, emailed or spoken with the artist Duncan MacAskill but when, a few years ago, we were rehearsing Hamlet at the Almeida, postcards from him started to arrive in the rehearsal room. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but this was part of a decades-long project in which MacAskill sends postcard-size original artworks in the mail \u2013 sometimes paint or ink, sometimes collage, sometimes text (often anagrams of the phrase ARTIST IN RESIDENCE) on wood or card. I love them \u2013 and the surprise of receiving them \u2013 and I love the openness and generosity of the gesture: art that flies off from the artist to an unseen destination. One arrived last week in the rehearsal room of The Doctor, my final Almeida show, like a little talisman from a friend I\u2019ve never met. 6. Nonfiction Modernists and Mavericks by Martin Gayford I loved Gayford\u2019s book Man With a Blue Scarf and its mirror logic: a portrait of the creation of a painting by Lucian Freud, whose subject is Gayford himself. This book, a history of postwar painting in London, is a kind of gallery, where Man With\u2026 was a single canvas. Freud reappears here, amid a star cast that includes Gillian Ayres, David Hockney and Francis Bacon, but the writing achieves an unusual intimacy with them and their world. The portrait of a London inspired and full of creative energy made me long for it to happen again.",

He broke down as he remembered the rush to escape, and the crowd that was so dense that they could hardly move. He and his family managed to board a train: \u201cWe dropped everything and fled.\u201d Relatives who didn\u2019t make it out were killed.</p> <p>They settled in Uzbekistan, where he met his wife when they were both 19 years old and wound up at the same table at the university: \u201cWe fell in love, and we never parted even for one day.\u201d</p> <p>He recalled the overcrowded housing in Uzbekistan, with multiple generations of a family forced to share a single room. He also had to rebuild his family\u2019s home after a 1966 earthquake.

This man is an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor \u2026 who has experienced all kinds of trauma.\u201d</p> <p>The family has also filed a formal discrimination complaint with the state, alleging the landlords targeted a \u201clow-income disabled immigrant family\u201d, and have told the family \u201cthey do not belong in a fancy place and can go live somewhere else\u201d. Tam denied the discrimination allegations, saying she has other disabled tenants and that the purpose of her eviction is to \u201cget rid of Section 8\u201d and increase the rents.</p> <p>The idea that he may ultimately be forced out of his home is unfathomable to Musiy. \u201cIt is everything to me.

His family found refuge in this northern California city after they were forced to leave Uzbekistan. \u201cI am an elderly man. Aren\u2019t you ashamed? Don\u2019t you believe in fairness? They have no soul and no heart.\u201d The eviction of Rishin provides a grim illustration of the severe housing crisis in the Bay Area, the lack of protections for some of the most vulnerable people, and the harassment and abuse that sick and elderly tenants can face in the final years of their lives, advocates said. The landlords, who have been fighting to evict Rishin for a year, also targeted his terminally ill son, Yaroslav, who lived with him in the apartment until his death in April. The owners, whose formal reason for the eviction is \u201cdesire to lease the unit at a higher rental rate\u201d, sent multiple termination notices and threats to the family while Yaroslav was fighting cancer and while he was in hospice care. The owners\u2019 lawyers also filed a formal eviction lawsuit that named Yaroslav as a defendant \u2013 after he was already dead. \u201cIt\u2019s like evicting somebody to his grave,\u201d said Svetlana Rishina, Musiy\u2019s daughter. Her brother was distraught about the eviction in his final weeks, which he spent bedridden in the apartment, she said: \u201cHe would say, \u2018Is the sheriff going to come in and put me out on the curb in my hospital bed?\u2019 I will be very cold, and I will die a horrible death.\u2019 That consumed his last days.\u201d \u2018We left everything behind\u2019 Musiy Rishin\u2019s modest second-story, two-bedroom apartment is located on a quiet street near the shore on the island of Alameda, a city in the bay between San Francisco and Oakland. The area feels like the suburbs but is in the center of an urban region with some of the most unaffordable rents in the country, a homelessness emergency and exorbitant Silicon Valley wealth. \u201cAs Englishmen say, \u2018my home is my castle,\u2019\u201d Musiy said, speaking in Russian, as his daughter translated. He pointed to bookshelves he built, his favorite literature, photos of his late wife and all the mementos in his apartment that he had gathered throughout his life. \u201cTo me, stability of a home was the goal.\u201d Musiy is deeply familiar with unstable living conditions, starting with his childhood in Dnepropetrovsk in Ukraine during the second world war. \u201cIt is so hard for me to talk about,\u201d he said, recalling the day when he was nine years old and Nazi bombers closed in on his city. He broke down as he remembered the rush to escape, and the crowd that was so dense that they could hardly move. He and his family managed to board a train: \u201cWe dropped everything and fled.\u201d Relatives who didn\u2019t make it out were killed. They settled in Uzbekistan, where he met his wife when they were both 19 years old and wound up at the same table at the university: \u201cWe fell in love, and we never parted even for one day.\u201d He recalled the overcrowded housing in Uzbekistan, with multiple generations of a family forced to share a single room. He also had to rebuild his family\u2019s home after a 1966 earthquake. In 1998, political uprisings and civil wars forced them to flee to the US: \u201cWe left everything behind for the second time.\u201d In Alameda, they received a voucher from the US government\u2019s Section 8 housing program, which subsidizes rent for low-income tenants. \u201cWhat beautiful people have greeted us,\u201d he said of the move to California. \u201cWe\u2019ve been treated very warmly in this country.\u201d But problems with his landlord escalated over time, and then last year, the notices started coming. An eviction on his deathbed: \u2018He was suffering\u2019 The first letter on 14 August 2018 said the landlords, Margaret Tam and her son Spencer Tam, would be increasing their rent by nearly $700 (from $2,520 to $3200). \u201cIt was outrageous and so unexpected,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I have left is money for food and some minimum things to take care of myself.\u201d Before he could even dispute the increase, the landlords came back with a much more terrifying letter two weeks later: they had decided to evict him and his son, and they had 90 days to leave. \u201cWe would never have imagined that someone would kick us out,\u201d he said, choking up as he noted that the home holds the \u201cmemories of the people so dear to me\u201d. Yaroslav\u2019s health was deteriorating at the time of the first notices, and at one point, he had to be taken away in an ambulance. The property management in the building was aware that Yaroslav was gravely ill, the family said. But the landlords continued the eviction battle. \u201cDoctors were telling us on a daily basis he was dying,\u201d said Svetlana, adding that the landlords handed her father another termination notice in December when he was on his way to the hospital to see his son. The landlords also falsely accused him of paying rent late, demanding a $75 late fee and then later saying it was a \u201cmistake\u201d, records show. Musiy\u2019s health also began to suffer due to stress. \u201cI got severely depressed,\u201d he said. \u201cMy doctors were trying to calm me down.\u201d By February, doctors for Yaroslav, who had colon cancer, told the family there was nothing left they could do, saying, \u201c\u2018You just have to make his life as comfortable as possible \u2013 provide him the best life you can,\u2019\u201d Svetlana recalled. The landlords made that impossible. The final eviction notice was sent on 3 April, and the family tried to conceal it from Yaroslav, but he knew what was happening and could not stop talking about his fears of dying on the street, his sister said. \u201cIt was very cruel.\u201d He died two weeks later at age 57. \u201cHe knew and he was really suffering about this,\u201d Musiy said. \u201cI hate thinking about it.\u201d \u201cIt completely robbed my brother of a peaceful ending to his life,\u201d Svetlana added. After the death, the landlords escalated their eviction efforts, filing a formal lawsuit to have Musiy removed \u2013 and naming his late son on the legal complaint. The case is moving through the courts. Section 8 tenants have minimal protections in Alameda, where there are also few landlords who accept the vouchers. That means Musiy is running out of time and options. In a lengthy phone interview, Margaret Tam defended the eviction and process, saying she wanted to charge market rate for the apartment, and that Musiy was the only Section 8 tenant remaining in the building, \u201cI\u2019m not a monster,\u201d said Tam, who is based in Arizona. \u201cI\u2019m not a greedy landlord, but I do want to make money when I\u2019m legally able to.\u201d Asked why she pursued the eviction while Yaroslav was dying, she responded, \u201cBecause somebody\u2019s sick, do you get free rent? We have to do what we have to do.\u201d She said she could renovate and make significantly more money from his unit, argued that she has no obligation to keep him there, and that Musiy should go live with his daughter: \u201cIt\u2019s a sad story. I cannot help him.\u201d \u201cI have a lot of elderly clients, but I have never seen anything this outrageous,\u201d said Sarah McCracken, a tenants\u2019 rights lawyer with Centro Legal de La Raza, who is representing Musiy. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing and senseless. This man is an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor \u2026 who has experienced all kinds of trauma.\u201d The family has also filed a formal discrimination complaint with the state, alleging the landlords targeted a \u201clow-income disabled immigrant family\u201d, and have told the family \u201cthey do not belong in a fancy place and can go live somewhere else\u201d. Tam denied the discrimination allegations, saying she has other disabled tenants and that the purpose of her eviction is to \u201cget rid of Section 8\u201d and increase the rents. The idea that he may ultimately be forced out of his home is unfathomable to Musiy. \u201cIt is everything to me. I have nothing else.\u201d",

Eyelids drooping, I veered across the road and forced myself to focus. I soon caught myself again and started looking for a suitable bus shelter \u2013 the famed sleeping choice of transcontinental riders. The ideal seemed to me enclosed on three sides, with a roof and a bench without seat dividers designed to stop you lying down. At 4am I found one, set my alarm and lay down in the what I was wearing. Half an hour later I was back on my bike refreshed. I had another bus shelter nap at midday and caught 40 winks mid-afternoon on the grass verge of a busy D-road.</p> <p>A final thunderstorm hit as I approached the Atlantic after 13 days on the road. Riding through the night, small roads like rivers and soaked to the skin, I was delighted to finish and see my family but sad that the bubble that had transported me across Europe would soon burst.</p> <p>The race officially finished on 12 August but 50 riders were still on the road. Some 115 had made it to Brest, and 100 had scratched. One broke his leg. Another smashed the front fork of his bike but hired a replacement from a cycle shop and finished in 6th place. Chatting to Kolbinger at the finishers\u2019 party at a harbour-side restaurant, her toughest moment came near the end. \u201cThere was a storm, my power bank was empty, my phone ran out of batteries, I ran out of food. It was hillier than I expected. That was hard.\u201d She only slept in hotels for two nights, spending the other eight rough \u2013 the worst an abandoned half-built house in Serbia, the best a cushioned swing-seat in a hotel garden. \u201cI think it was the most efficient way,\u201d she said. \u201cI was off the bike to asleep in 10 minutes. Four or five hours later I was riding again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fbeb5b2e6e915e3dd7c4559f44d6a42698707f8b0%3Fcrop%3D0_710_4160_5200&amp;left-caption=Riding%20a%20balcony%20road%20in%20France.%20&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff727af04d66103c8c580723d02fb6ac9ef12be1c%3Fcrop%3D1642_0_3328_4160&amp;right-caption=Ross%20Thomas%20ices%20his%20ankles.%20Photographs%20by%20James%20Robertson&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"A balcony road in France and swollen ankles.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fbeb5b2e6e915e3dd7c4559f44d6a42698707f8b0%3Fcrop%3D0_710_4160_5200&left-caption=Riding%20a%20balcony%20road%20in%20France.%20&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff727af04d66103c8c580723d02fb6ac9ef12be1c%3Fcrop%3D1642_0_3328_4160&right-caption=Ross%20Thomas%20ices%20his%20ankles.%20Photographs%20by%20James%20Robertson&always-place-captions-below=false\">A balcony road in France and swollen ankles.</a> </figure>  <p>Next month Kolbinger begins training as a surgeon but this week she is riding the 1,200km Paris-Brest-Paris audax. \u201cI was going for the women\u2019s podium but I never would have expected to be the winner of the overall competition,\u201d she added.</p> <p>\u201cI loved the race.

This month the seventh edition was held \u2013 the third since 35-year-old Hall was killed in a road collision during the Indian Pacific Wheel race in Australia.

Eyelids drooping, I veered across the road and forced myself to focus. I soon caught myself again and started looking for a suitable bus shelter \u2013 the famed sleeping choice of transcontinental riders. The ideal seemed to me enclosed on three sides, with a roof and a bench without seat dividers designed to stop you lying down. At 4am I found one, set my alarm and lay down in the what I was wearing. Half an hour later I was back on my bike refreshed. I had another bus shelter nap at midday and caught 40 winks mid-afternoon on the grass verge of a busy D-road. A final thunderstorm hit as I approached the Atlantic after 13 days on the road. Riding through the night, small roads like rivers and soaked to the skin, I was delighted to finish and see my family but sad that the bubble that had transported me across Europe would soon burst. The race officially finished on 12 August but 50 riders were still on the road. Some 115 had made it to Brest, and 100 had scratched. One broke his leg. Another smashed the front fork of his bike but hired a replacement from a cycle shop and finished in 6th place. Chatting to Kolbinger at the finishers\u2019 party at a harbour-side restaurant, her toughest moment came near the end. \u201cThere was a storm, my power bank was empty, my phone ran out of batteries, I ran out of food. It was hillier than I expected. That was hard.\u201d She only slept in hotels for two nights, spending the other eight rough \u2013 the worst an abandoned half-built house in Serbia, the best a cushioned swing-seat in a hotel garden. \u201cI think it was the most efficient way,\u201d she said. \u201cI was off the bike to asleep in 10 minutes. Four or five hours later I was riding again.\u201d Next month Kolbinger begins training as a surgeon but this week she is riding the 1,200km Paris-Brest-Paris audax. \u201cI was going for the women\u2019s podium but I never would have expected to be the winner of the overall competition,\u201d she added. \u201cI loved the race. It felt like a real adventure, with all the places I was able to see, completely new to me, and challenges like finding a safe sleeping spot, they are not things I do in my everyday life. Those were genuinely the best consecutive 10 days of my life so far.\u201d As for me, I\u2019ll never again be able to pass a bus shelter without assessing its sleeping potential.",

Gatrell frames it as central to the continent\u2019s postwar development, both economic and social, beginning with the huge forced relocations and refugee flows that followed the second world war, running through the postcolonial labour migrations that fuelled Europe\u2019s economic renaissance, to the wars and crises in \u201cperipheral Europe\u201d and Europe\u2019s \u201cnear abroad\u201d that have been in the spotlight in recent years.</p> <p>Perhaps the most striking chapter \u2013 because it\u2019s least familiar \u2013 is the one that deals with the first of these, which Gatrell describes as \u201cviolent peacetime\u201d, with 17 million people on the move. The horror of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/01/news.features11\" title=\"\">Red Army\u2019s occupation of Germany</a> is well known, even if the vast numbers never fail to shock, but other countries seized the opportunity, too.

Not least, the <a href=\"https://minorityrights.org/minorities/east-african-asians/\" title=\"\">East African Asians</a>, whose presence in Africa was the direct result of the complex economic relations between the different constituent parts of the British empire, a fact many British politicians would rather have forgotten.</p> <p>And while other accounts often suggest that European countries acquired large non-white populations by accident, as a byproduct of labour migration that was always intended to be temporary, he notes that, long before Powell\u2019s speech, politicians worried about the threat immigration posed to ethnic and religious homogeneity. Churchill wanted to fight the 1955 election with the slogan \u201cKeep England White\u201d, while De Gaulle famously worried that his home village would have to be renamed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/the-last-warrior-behind-the-self-made-myth-of-charles-de-gaulle\" title=\"\">Colombey-les-deux-Mosqu\u00e9es</a>\u201d.</p> <p>One strength of the book is its focus on the stories of individual migrants, the communities in which they arrived, and their continued connections, at least in some cases, with their countries of origin. From an ethnic German who moved from Kazakhstan to Hamburg, to an Iranian anthropologist now living in Sweden, we get at least a glimpse of the complexity of the topic.</p> <p>Gatrell\u2019s nuanced and sympathetic treatment of the variety of the immigrant experience \u2013 and its impact on European societies \u2013 can also be seen as a rejoinder to two recent, well-publicised books. As <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/H-L-Mencken\" title=\"\">HL Mencken</a> wrote: \u201cfor every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple and wrong.\u201d Douglas Murray, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/06/strange-death-europe-immigration-xenophobia\" title=\"\"><em>The Strange Death of Europe</em></a>, an extended mixture of conspiracy theory and bigotry, wants some version of Trump\u2019s ban on Muslim immigration. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/21/white-identity-is-meaningless-dignity-is-found-in-shared-hopes\" title=\"\">Eric Kaufmann\u2019s <em>Whiteshift</em></a> argues for ethnic \u2013 that is, white \u2013 preference in immigration policies to preserve a supposedly threatened \u201cwhite identity\u201d.</p> <p>Gatrell, however, offers no such simplicities. He recognises \u2013 as the title makes clear \u2013 that migration can be unsettling, both for migrants and the societies where they arrive. Walls and fences \u2013 real and metaphorical \u2013 can avert this, at least in part, but there are costs. Without postwar migration, \u201cthe continent as a whole would have been much impoverished \u2013 less unsettled, perhaps, but greatly diminished\u201d. He does not conceal his disappointment with the short-sighted and inhumane response of most European countries to the migrant crisis of 2015: \u201cthe default position was deterrence, detention and deportation\u201d.</p> <p>But what should that mean for the future? There are no easy answers, and <em>The Unsettling of Europe</em> certainly does not offer any. Here in the UK, however, there are some grounds for optimism. The political upheavals sparked by Brexit \u2013 itself caused in large part by public attitudes to immigration \u2013 offer a window of opportunity to reset not just immigration policy but our broader perspective. This will take a degree of courage and initiative, not just from politicians, but from the rest of us. As Gatrell shows us, it will be contested, messy and imperfect, just as in every previous historical episode; but, as he also demonstrates, it can also enrich us.</p> <p><em>Jonathan Portes is </em><em>professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London</em><em> and the author of </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/what-do-we-know-and-what-should-we-do-about-immigration-9781526464422.html\" title=\"\"><em>What Do We Know and What Should We Do About Immigration?</em></a><em> (Sage)</em></p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Unsettling of Europe</em> is published by Allen Lane (\u00a330).

Churchill wanted to fight the 1955 election with the slogan \u201cKeep England White\u201d, while De Gaulle famously worried that his home village would have to be renamed \u201cColombey-les-deux-Mosqu\u00e9es\u201d. One strength of the book is its focus on the stories of individual migrants, the communities in which they arrived, and their continued connections, at least in some cases, with their countries of origin. From an ethnic German who moved from Kazakhstan to Hamburg, to an Iranian anthropologist now living in Sweden, we get at least a glimpse of the complexity of the topic. Gatrell\u2019s nuanced and sympathetic treatment of the variety of the immigrant experience \u2013 and its impact on European societies \u2013 can also be seen as a rejoinder to two recent, well-publicised books. As HL Mencken wrote: \u201cfor every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple and wrong.\u201d Douglas Murray, author of The Strange Death of Europe, an extended mixture of conspiracy theory and bigotry, wants some version of Trump\u2019s ban on Muslim immigration. Eric Kaufmann\u2019s Whiteshift argues for ethnic \u2013 that is, white \u2013 preference in immigration policies to preserve a supposedly threatened \u201cwhite identity\u201d. Gatrell, however, offers no such simplicities. He recognises \u2013 as the title makes clear \u2013 that migration can be unsettling, both for migrants and the societies where they arrive. Walls and fences \u2013 real and metaphorical \u2013 can avert this, at least in part, but there are costs. Without postwar migration, \u201cthe continent as a whole would have been much impoverished \u2013 less unsettled, perhaps, but greatly diminished\u201d. He does not conceal his disappointment with the short-sighted and inhumane response of most European countries to the migrant crisis of 2015: \u201cthe default position was deterrence, detention and deportation\u201d. But what should that mean for the future? There are no easy answers, and The Unsettling of Europe certainly does not offer any. Here in the UK, however, there are some grounds for optimism. The political upheavals sparked by Brexit \u2013 itself caused in large part by public attitudes to immigration \u2013 offer a window of opportunity to reset not just immigration policy but our broader perspective. This will take a degree of courage and initiative, not just from politicians, but from the rest of us. As Gatrell shows us, it will be contested, messy and imperfect, just as in every previous historical episode; but, as he also demonstrates, it can also enrich us. Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London and the author of What Do We Know and What Should We Do About Immigration?

And perhaps by the end of the century a few adventurers will be living on Mars. Musk has said he wants to \u201cdie on Mars, but just not on impact\u201d and that\u2019s not a crazy aspiration. But it is a delusion to think we can solve Earth\u2019s problems by relocating to Mars. I completely disagree with Musk and with my late colleague Stephen Hawking on that, because dealing with climate change on Earth is a doddle compared with terraforming Mars. Do you think we should be concerned about artificial intelligence? I don\u2019t worry yet about a general intelligence that invades the internet of things and takes over the world \u2013 that still seems to be science fiction. But AI and robotics are affecting the labour market and lots of jobs will be replaced or supplemented by AI. These will include work in call centres and warehouses. But that would be good news if the people displaced could find work where the human element is crucial, such as caring for the old, the young and the vulnerable. There are too few such jobs now and they\u2019re insecure and poorly paid. Those who employ robots need to be taxed and that funding should be used to set up huge numbers of dignified and secure jobs of the kind a humane society needs.

None at all. I was upfront about it. I said: \u2018You will be beaten.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>\u201cTo be president in France, you had to have 30-40 years of experience in politics, been elected mayor somewhere, be from the right or left. That\u2019s how it\u2019s always been done. And here was a man, 38 years old, never elected to anything, who was right <em>and</em> left. Honestly, I told him his chances were virtually nil.\u201d</p> <p>Besson still said yes to Macron\u2019s offer. \u201cFor a writer, it was a thrilling experience being in the frontline of the campaign, and I told myself that it wasn\u2019t a problem if he wasn\u2019t elected in the end.\u201d</p> <p>His subsequent book, <em>Un Personnage de Roman</em> (A Character from a Novel), was published a year after Macron proved him wrong.</p> <p>\u201cI saw the impossible become improbable, the improbable become plausible, the plausible transform into reality,\u201d Besson wrote.</p> <p>Today, Besson speaks to his friend Brigitte regularly; they talk of \u201cliterature and life\u201d, he says.

Power has given him a sort of seriousness, but in terms of personal relationships nothing has changed. He still has the same energy, attention to others, the same humour.</p> <p>\u201cWith Brigitte, it\u2019s a very strong friendship. We see each other often and I talk to Brigitte at least once a week. I was on the phone to her the day before yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>While admitting his relationship with the Macrons is \u201cclose\u201d, Besson insists that he is not part of the president\u2019s power circle.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a politician nor an adviser. That doesn\u2019t interest me. I give him my impressions, my feelings and my views. I absolutely do not give him advice.\u201d</p> <p>Friendship has come at a price. Last year, when Macron appointed Besson to the coveted post of French consul in Los Angeles, the writer found himself in the critics\u2019 crossfire as Macron was accused of regally dispensing favours to \u201ccourtier\u201d friends.

She edited an essay I had written about living in France when she was at the magazine and knew about my familiarity with the French language and culture.

I\u2019ve often spoken about my regret that the films with which I\u2019m most strongly associated don\u2019t have any (openly) gay characters. I suppose I liked the idea of helping to make a love story between two teenagers accessible. The fact that the time period (80s) also happens to be the same as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/26/drama.comedy1\" title=\"\">John Hughes films</a> makes it even more poignant for me.</p> <p><strong>You describe yourself as a </strong><strong>lifelong Francophile</strong><strong>.

Besson recalls that he and the woman who would become France\u2019s first lady chatted about her favourite literary figure, Emma Bovary. The choice of Gustave Flaubert\u2019s tragic heroine who is passionate and bored with the banality of provincial life but trapped in a mediocre marriage, was not, Besson thinks, an accident.

Work is under way to turn the book \u2013 a French Brokeback Mountain \u2013 into a film.

Like a taste in music\u2026 What are you reading? I\u2019m just finishing up Mythos, the Greek myths retold by Stephen Fry, which I\u2019ve enjoyed immensely. What are you working on and do you plan to do more translating? I\u2019ve been working on a book of essays, and a screenplay that I will direct. I\u2019m finishing a film I\u2019m acting in and also acting in a television series [Riverdale]. I\u2019m also working on a web series with a friend. And\u2026 probably something else that I\u2019m forgetting about. I don\u2019t have any plans at the moment to do more translating, but I\u2019m open to the idea. I enjoyed the process very much, even though it was incredibly time consuming. \u2022 Lie With Me by Philippe Besson, translated by Molly Ringwald, is published by Penguin on 5 September (\u00a38.99).

Labour relentlessly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/jeremy-corbyn-urges-opposition-leaders-and-tory-rebels-to-help-oust-pm\" title=\"\">demands a general election</a>, and may attempt to bring one about in the autumn, but is the party in good shape to fight what will be one of the most critical campaigns in our modern history? When I put this important, yet neglected, question to one senior figure in the party, he responded with blunt candour: \u201cNo, we\u2019re not ready. Not remotely ready.\u201d</p> <p>Let\u2019s break it down into five components: candidates, leadership, messages, mobilisation and money. In each category, Labour faces difficulties. Some are relatively mild. Other handicaps are severe and hard, even impossible to address in the very little time that may be left before an election is upon us.</p> <p>Labour will be outgunned financially. Tory donors who went on strike during Theresa May\u2019s tenure are opening their chequebooks for Boris Johnson. The Conservatives won\u2019t have a problem spending up to the \u00a320m limit on election campaigns; Labour sources believe they won\u2019t get close to that figure. High-value donations have dried up under Jeremy Corbyn. That is not surprising \u2013 his remaining devotees would probably say that it is a virtue \u2013 since Labour\u2019s policies are not friendly to wealthy individuals. The lack of high-value donors was compensated for by the surge in the party\u2019s membership during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/jun/12/oh-jeremy-corbyn-how-people-started-chanting-the-labour-leaders-name-video\" title=\"\">\u201cOh, Jeremy Corbyn\u201d</a> period.

In an act of spectacularly terrible timing, the Labour leadership has chosen this autumn to unleash what one shadow cabinet member predicts will be \u201cmayhem\u201d in local parties. Beginning in September, all Labour MPs will be exposed to potential deselection, a process that starts with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/04/trigger-ballots-prove-an-unwelcome-distraction-for-under-fire-labour-mps\" title=\"\">\u201ctrigger ballot\u201d</a>.

The Tories don\u2019t expect to win on the NHS; they seek to neutralise it as an issue. On law and order, where Mrs May was vulnerable at the last election because of cuts to police numbers, the Tories are striving to reassert their traditional advantage and hope a hard line on crime will help push Brexity Labour voters into the blue column. On Brexit, they look to attract the no-deal and let\u2019s-get-it-over-with segments of the electorate.

      "bodyText": "Be careful what you ask for. Labour relentlessly demands a general election, and may attempt to bring one about in the autumn, but is the party in good shape to fight what will be one of the most critical campaigns in our modern history? When I put this important, yet neglected, question to one senior figure in the party, he responded with blunt candour: \u201cNo, we\u2019re not ready. Not remotely ready.\u201d Let\u2019s break it down into five components: candidates, leadership, messages, mobilisation and money. In each category, Labour faces difficulties. Some are relatively mild. Other handicaps are severe and hard, even impossible to address in the very little time that may be left before an election is upon us. Labour will be outgunned financially. Tory donors who went on strike during Theresa May\u2019s tenure are opening their chequebooks for Boris Johnson. The Conservatives won\u2019t have a problem spending up to the \u00a320m limit on election campaigns; Labour sources believe they won\u2019t get close to that figure. High-value donations have dried up under Jeremy Corbyn. That is not surprising \u2013 his remaining devotees would probably say that it is a virtue \u2013 since Labour\u2019s policies are not friendly to wealthy individuals. The lack of high-value donors was compensated for by the surge in the party\u2019s membership during the \u201cOh, Jeremy Corbyn\u201d period. The party started working on the basis that this would endure and set budgets on the assumption that it would have a minimum of 500,000 members. As adulation of Mr Corbyn has deflated, so has the membership. Party insiders report that the number has fallen below the half-million mark, unravelling those budget assumptions. The trade unions will try to help out, but their ability to do so has been crimped. Union political funds were depleted by the 2017 campaign and Tory-introduced changes to the law, which requires new recruits to actively opt in before some of their dues can be put in a political fund, have made it harder for the unions to throw a financial lifeline to Labour. When an election is on the horizon, any party likes to have well-established parliamentary candidates working closely with local activists and using every ounce of their combined energy to prepare for the contest. In an act of spectacularly terrible timing, the Labour leadership has chosen this autumn to unleash what one shadow cabinet member predicts will be \u201cmayhem\u201d in local parties. Beginning in September, all Labour MPs will be exposed to potential deselection, a process that starts with a \u201ctrigger ballot\u201d. This is a sort of confidence vote and, when lost by an MP, it can pave the way for their removal. This will happen in three waves. In London, Neil Coyle and Margaret Hodge will be in the first wave. It is surely not a coincidence, as the old Marxists used to say, that both these MPs have been fierce critics of Mr Corbyn. On Merseyside, some well-informed observers think that every single Labour MP, except Dan Carden, will be threatened with deselection. That would include Louise Ellman, the last Jewish Labour MP on Merseyside. The struggle to defend themselves against trigger ballots is consuming the energy of Labour MPs and dividing local parties, just when they should be preparing to do battle with the Tories. The rules and how they should be interpreted are open to dispute, so there will be challenges, legal and otherwise, by Labour MPs targeted for eviction. Some may decide to stand as independents, splitting the Labour vote.

Britain and the other EU countries in attendance \u2013 France, Germany and Italy \u2013 have plenty of tensions of their own. \u201cThey were nervous, and that makes us nervous,\u201d an EU source said of talks with officials in Whitehall about Boris Johnson\u2019s first appearance as a head of government on the world stage. There is currently no relationship between the power players in the EU and the new British government, and there is very little trust. Everything that Johnson has done so far in power is seen as being for domestic consumption, and, to a large extent, that is expected to continue. Some fear a \u201cbig moment\u201d from Johnson in Biarritz at which he seeks to blame Brussels for the Brexit impasse and help along the dangerous slide to a no-deal exit. But hope also springs eternal that the new prime minister will at some point add some ballast to the claim that he genuinely wants to leave the European Union with a deal. Biarritz is again seen as being as good a point as any. \u201cWe believe that the UK is willing to leave the EU on 31 October,\u201d a source said. \u201cWe do not have any evidence yet that the UK wants to negotiate a deal.\u201d All is being done in Brussels to get things right on the European side and to avoid a repetition of the Salzburg summit where Theresa May was seen to have been humiliated. \u201cA frosty approach would be self-defeating,\u201d an EU official said, while admitting that Donald Tusk, president of the European council, who will also attend, doesn\u2019t always toe the line. Everything has been contemplated, from the tone of the speeches to how to deal with an unlikely, but not unthinkable, attempt by Trump to give \u201cthe art of the deal\u201d a go in the Brexit negotiations. On the British side, there appears to be some willing. Johnson is to speak on the phone to Ireland\u2019s prime minister Leo Varadkar as well as to Tusk this week. More significantly, he will leave the comfort of Downing Street and the bubble of advisers led by Dominic Cummings for Paris and Berlin to meet Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel for the first time since becoming prime minister. \u201cPerhaps those meetings and Biarritz will be a reality check,\u201d said an EU diplomat intimately involved in the Brexit negotiations. Johnson\u2019s claims to want to renegotiate the deal appear empty so far given his insistence that the UK will leave on 31 October, which leaves little time for a serious rethink. There have not been any proposals sent Brussels\u2019 way. \u201cThey have made it easy for the EU side in a way,\u201d said a source. \u201cIf they came up with a 15-year time limit on the backstop or some way in which the people of Northern Ireland had a regular opportunity to vote in favour of exiting the backstop, you might have some more difficult conversations. \u201cBut that is a million miles from where we are.\u201d When Johnson\u2019s EU adviser David Frost visited Brussels recently he admitted that even without the backstop there was no guarantee the withdrawal agreement would be backed by parliament. \u201cSo the position is get rid of the backstop and then we will see what else we don\u2019t like?\u201d asked one diplomat. \u201cWhere\u2019s the incentive for us?\u201d In reality, August may just be an ordeal to get through for both sides. \u201cIt depends on what Boris Johnson really wants,\u201d a rueful diplomat concluded.",

Might Steve Smith be out before the end of the day? Who should open the bowling \u2013 Jofra Archer or Chris Woakes? In the members\u2019 queue opposite, a peacock\u2019s pride of blazers and primary-coloured trousers politely lined up. Phone calls were taken at higher-than-average volume \u201cI walked from Baker Street.\u201d \u201cDid you get the doughnuts?\u201d \u201cWhere are you?\u201d A smiling woman shook a charity box tin, proffering jelly beans in return.</p> <p>Then the unfastened zips of a bag check, the click of the turnstiles and in past the Nursery ground, where programme and scorecard sellers in huts squared up their wares. As the ground filled it sighed and smiled, lightened by 20,000 people\u2019s delight at the conviviality of it all. Outside the Allen Stand a jazz band, with an average age older even than that of the MCC membership, rattled through some classics, camouflaging the gurgle and fizz of the nearby coffee van. And everywhere: greetings, handshakes, backslaps. Jerry, old thing.</p> <p>Jofra Archer is who we\u2019d come for. And there he was, warming up, all skinny legs and big white trainers. From the vantage point of a tier up, spectators pondered why he was bowling left-arm spin in the warm-up. It turned out no one had a clue but there was a lot of joy in the accompanying guesswork.</p> <p>Shane Warne rang the five-minute bell and the players were out. The floodlights were so bright that you shielded your eyes as if it was the sun itself. Cameron Bancroft and Usman Khawaja steeled themselves. An intensity started to settle, the sort that comes when everyone recognises they\u2019re watching something special \u2013 like this young man formed of liquid, thrown the ball at the Pavilion End, who strolled in and with a flick of the wrist produced 89, 90, 93mph deliveries. Bancroft took a couple in the ribs, on the pads, as Archer kept it short.</p> <p>The ground enjoyed the Australians getting a good peppering, oohing and ahhing with a carry-on frenzy until, three quarters of an hour in, Archer at last trapped his man lbw.

This was the big one and we roared the bowlers in. But England couldn\u2019t quite snare him, despite a pantomime of his most awkward fly-swatting leaves.</p> <p>A couple more wickets, more reviews and that, it turned out, was that: three minutes before one o\u2019clock the drizzle and gloom became too much and the players were ushered off by the umpires. On came the covers thanks to a well-drilled team, noiseless from a distance, then the marching band and the chatter of the ground announcer. By then food had taken over, though the pop of the champagne cork and the tearing open of crisp packets had been aural accompaniments since before play began at 11am.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"313156375c9c92a7c7e000e03d1b281c85380a78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/313156375c9c92a7c7e000e03d1b281c85380a78/0_0_3911_2346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian supporters look on shortly before rain stops play.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian supporters look on shortly before rain stops play.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An hour passed, more. The sky gently glowered, mostly without any discernible promise of future play. By the Bicentenary bar, a hum of bass and tenor was hemmed in by the wet and the wall; outside, the rustle of rainware, the whisper of disappointment and the murmur of indecision. \u201cShall we call it a day?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s give it another half an hour.\u201d Water bottles were refilled at the fountains and a slow tap of walking sticks did a circuit.</p> <p>As the damp continued, Lord\u2019s fell back on its surefire winning formula and screened the highlights of the World Cup final on the big screen. In every stand, people in that slightly uncomfortable state of having been too cold already for a couple of hours gripped their arms across their chests in anticipation of a last ball that they already knew the answer to. As Jos Buttler ran out Martin Guptill (again) spontaneous applause and cheers burst from the ranks of the soggy and that, for the majority, was the sign.

Just to the north-west of Euston station, where that train drew in, was where I was lucky enough to be going, somewhere else unique in its soundscape: Lord\u2019s, putting on its best bib and tucker for the Friday of the Ashes Test, the highlight of any cricketing summer \u2013 although perhaps, just for once, not this one. The queue outside the North Gate burbled with anticipation from well before 8am. Might Steve Smith be out before the end of the day? Who should open the bowling \u2013 Jofra Archer or Chris Woakes? In the members\u2019 queue opposite, a peacock\u2019s pride of blazers and primary-coloured trousers politely lined up. Phone calls were taken at higher-than-average volume \u201cI walked from Baker Street.\u201d \u201cDid you get the doughnuts?\u201d \u201cWhere are you?\u201d A smiling woman shook a charity box tin, proffering jelly beans in return. Then the unfastened zips of a bag check, the click of the turnstiles and in past the Nursery ground, where programme and scorecard sellers in huts squared up their wares. As the ground filled it sighed and smiled, lightened by 20,000 people\u2019s delight at the conviviality of it all. Outside the Allen Stand a jazz band, with an average age older even than that of the MCC membership, rattled through some classics, camouflaging the gurgle and fizz of the nearby coffee van. And everywhere: greetings, handshakes, backslaps. Jerry, old thing. Jofra Archer is who we\u2019d come for. And there he was, warming up, all skinny legs and big white trainers. From the vantage point of a tier up, spectators pondered why he was bowling left-arm spin in the warm-up. It turned out no one had a clue but there was a lot of joy in the accompanying guesswork. Shane Warne rang the five-minute bell and the players were out. The floodlights were so bright that you shielded your eyes as if it was the sun itself. Cameron Bancroft and Usman Khawaja steeled themselves. An intensity started to settle, the sort that comes when everyone recognises they\u2019re watching something special \u2013 like this young man formed of liquid, thrown the ball at the Pavilion End, who strolled in and with a flick of the wrist produced 89, 90, 93mph deliveries. Bancroft took a couple in the ribs, on the pads, as Archer kept it short. The ground enjoyed the Australians getting a good peppering, oohing and ahhing with a carry-on frenzy until, three quarters of an hour in, Archer at last trapped his man lbw. But what was this? Bancroft had the audacity to review and all held their breath \u2013 like a moment of feedback from 1990 as Graham Gooch approached his 300. Eyes moved to the big screen where a told-you-so roar said the review was junk. Unbridled delight. I was there \u2013 were you there? \u2013 when Archer got his first Test wicket. Who next to the lions but Smith? The genius disguised as a medieval Saint Vitus\u2019s dance. His reception was mixed \u2013 if there was booing, it was overlaid with applause and anticipation. This was the big one and we roared the bowlers in. But England couldn\u2019t quite snare him, despite a pantomime of his most awkward fly-swatting leaves. A couple more wickets, more reviews and that, it turned out, was that: three minutes before one o\u2019clock the drizzle and gloom became too much and the players were ushered off by the umpires. On came the covers thanks to a well-drilled team, noiseless from a distance, then the marching band and the chatter of the ground announcer. By then food had taken over, though the pop of the champagne cork and the tearing open of crisp packets had been aural accompaniments since before play began at 11am. An hour passed, more. The sky gently glowered, mostly without any discernible promise of future play. By the Bicentenary bar, a hum of bass and tenor was hemmed in by the wet and the wall; outside, the rustle of rainware, the whisper of disappointment and the murmur of indecision. \u201cShall we call it a day?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s give it another half an hour.\u201d Water bottles were refilled at the fountains and a slow tap of walking sticks did a circuit. As the damp continued, Lord\u2019s fell back on its surefire winning formula and screened the highlights of the World Cup final on the big screen. In every stand, people in that slightly uncomfortable state of having been too cold already for a couple of hours gripped their arms across their chests in anticipation of a last ball that they already knew the answer to. As Jos Buttler ran out Martin Guptill (again) spontaneous applause and cheers burst from the ranks of the soggy and that, for the majority, was the sign. This thing wasn\u2019t going to restart, it was time to go. Through the awkward metal-clink turnstiles again went the red trousers and the accents fermented on the playing fields of schools with their own cricket pitches, their hampers now emptied of better-than-average plonk. But also everyone else too \u2013 whatever story the World Cup meeting of Nigel Farage and Piers Morgan here might like to think it told, Lord\u2019s is more than just the playground for the well-connected and the ugly right-wing. The sound of Lord\u2019s is that of a longed-for day off, a meeting place for old friends and beloved family and a chance, if you can afford a ticket, to watch the best players on the most famous ground of them all.",

Before becoming pope in 2013, Jorge Bergoglio, then a cardinal, lived an austere life, with a firm commitment to Argentina\u2019s poor and marginalised. Bergoglio was a familiar figure in another giant Buenos Aires shanty town, Villa 21-24, to which, as the city\u2019s archbishop, he travelled by bus and on foot to say mass once a week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4dcfb91512815b6250332fb04742897db882ca1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dcfb91512815b6250332fb04742897db882ca1e/0_354_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conservative president Mauricio Macri is said to have lost touch with both the poor and the middle class.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conservative president Mauricio Macri is said to have lost touch with both the poor and the middle class.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Agustin Marcarian/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rodrigo Zarazaga, a Jesuit priest and political analyst connected to Pope Francis, believes Macri suffered this unexpectedly harsh defeat because the millionaire businessman had lost touch with Argentina\u2019s reality.</p> <p>\u201cArgentina suffered a social big bang and now lives in two separate galaxies hurling away from each other: the galaxy of the poor, informal workers collecting social aid who live in shanty towns; and the galaxy of people with formal employment, medical insurance and private schools,\u201d he said.</p> <p>An expert on the political workings of the greater Buenos Aires Area, where about a third of Argentina\u2019s population are crammed into 0.5% of its territory, the Jesuit believes Kirchner outwitted Macri by winning the support of Sergio Massa, a third-party candidate who came in third with 21% of the vote in the 2015 presidential elections. Despite rumours he might run as Macri\u2019s vice-president, Massa finally opted for a seat in Congress on the Fern\u00e1ndez-Kirchner ticket.</p> <p>Macri seems to have underestimated Kirchner\u2019s political acumen, assuming that she, a once-fiery, polarising president who delivered lengthy speeches on television, was relishing the prospect of a return to the highest office in the land.</p> <p>Instead, Kirchner stunned the nation by handing the presidential slot to Peronist moderate Fern\u00e1ndez, who had resigned from Kirchner\u2019s government in 2008 to become a critic of her populist style. She reserved the vice-presidential candidacy for herself.</p> <p>Although there is little doubt in people\u2019s minds that it is Kirchner who will call the shots if her party is elected, the implication that her bravado will be kept in check by Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s even temper seems to have convinced middle-class voters.</p> <p>\u201cKirchner kept her share of votes among the poorer people, got 2.5 million votes of the lower middle class from Massa, and the vote of the troubled middle class from Fern\u00e1ndez,\u201d said Zarazaga.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22ae4de59f16c6ecfae2b11718db9fbe202aad4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22ae4de59f16c6ecfae2b11718db9fbe202aad4e/0_861_5206_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest against the economic crisis at the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest against the economic crisis at the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fern\u00e1ndez is also linked in the public\u2019s mind to the economic turnaround during the 2003-07 government of N\u00e9stor Kirchner, in which Fern\u00e1ndez was cabinet chief. Cristina Kirchner\u2019s husband, who died of a heart attack in 2010, successfully steered Argentina out of its 2001 economic debacle, when the country defaulted on its massive foreign debt, poverty rose to 54% of the population, and the currency collapsed.</p> <p>That crisis plunged Argentina into chaos as savers\u2019 accounts were frozen to stop a run on the banks. Dozens died in violent protests and supermarket looting. Today, the whiff of an economic meltdown is again in the air. Macri\u2019s defeat shook the financial markets and sent the peso tumbling, losing 25% of its value against the dollar and adding fuel to Argentina\u2019s already steep inflation rate, the third-highest in the world after Venezuela and Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Macri, a millionaire businessman, is paying a heavy price for failing to deliver on his emphatic promise of zero inflation and zero poverty when he took office in December 2015. Inflation hit 54% over the last 12 months, twice the rate when he took office. Foreign debt has also more than doubled, after a loss of investor confidence in emerging markets forced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/argentina-imf-biggest-loan\" title=\"\">Macri to seek a $57.1bn rescue package from the IMF last September</a>, the largest loan it has ever handed out.</p> <p>Prices rocketed last week; retailers are battling a deadly combination of inflation and devaluation, which makes it impossible for them to keep pace with the crisis. In one day, the price of a macchiato in the trendy coffee shops of Palermo Soho in the capital rose by nearly 25% in pesos, while at the same time dropping from $1.78 to $1.58.</p> <p>Juan Grabois, a social leader who also has close links with Pope Francis, heads the Movement of Excluded Workers (MTE), a large alliance of people without formal employment.

      "bodyText": "Father Guillermo Torre, known as Willy to his parishioners, has been through this before. \u201cI arrived here 20 years ago in 1999, right before the economic collapse of 2001,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u201d is Villa 31, a giant slum that sprawls beside the luxurious Recoleta and Retiro neighbourhoods of central Buenos Aires, a city within a city of which Torre is the parish priest. \u201cBack then Villa 31\u2019s population was 12,500; now it is 45,000,\u201d he says, accepting a constant stream of greetings and hugs from recuperating addicts arriving at his drug rehabilitation centre. Torre\u2019s ever-expanding parish reflects the gulf that has opened in Argentina over the past two decades between the haves and the have-nots. Far from shrinking, that gap has widened during the current government of conservative President Mauricio Macri, whose Cambiemos party suffered a resounding defeat in open primaries last Sunday. Macri lost by 15 points to the populist Frente de Todos ticket of Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and Cristina Kirchner, the fiery and popular two-time former president who has survived countless corruption investigations to dash Macri\u2019s hope of re-election in the presidential elections this October. Torre said: \u201cHere, 70% of the people voted for the Frente de Todos, which shows the impact of the economic crisis not only on poor people but on the middle class as well, because people here who worked an eight-hour day as domestics in city homes are now only working four hours, because the middle class can\u2019t afford a full day any more.\u201d Following a sustained reduction in poverty during Kirchner\u2019s years in office, from 2007 to 2015, some 2 million people have fallen below the breadline since Macri took office, statistics from Argentina\u2019s Catholic University show, jumping from 29% to 35% of the population. The Catholic church is deeply concerned about the growth of poverty in the home country of Pope Francis. Before becoming pope in 2013, Jorge Bergoglio, then a cardinal, lived an austere life, with a firm commitment to Argentina\u2019s poor and marginalised. Bergoglio was a familiar figure in another giant Buenos Aires shanty town, Villa 21-24, to which, as the city\u2019s archbishop, he travelled by bus and on foot to say mass once a week. Rodrigo Zarazaga, a Jesuit priest and political analyst connected to Pope Francis, believes Macri suffered this unexpectedly harsh defeat because the millionaire businessman had lost touch with Argentina\u2019s reality. \u201cArgentina suffered a social big bang and now lives in two separate galaxies hurling away from each other: the galaxy of the poor, informal workers collecting social aid who live in shanty towns; and the galaxy of people with formal employment, medical insurance and private schools,\u201d he said. An expert on the political workings of the greater Buenos Aires Area, where about a third of Argentina\u2019s population are crammed into 0.5% of its territory, the Jesuit believes Kirchner outwitted Macri by winning the support of Sergio Massa, a third-party candidate who came in third with 21% of the vote in the 2015 presidential elections. Despite rumours he might run as Macri\u2019s vice-president, Massa finally opted for a seat in Congress on the Fern\u00e1ndez-Kirchner ticket. Macri seems to have underestimated Kirchner\u2019s political acumen, assuming that she, a once-fiery, polarising president who delivered lengthy speeches on television, was relishing the prospect of a return to the highest office in the land. Instead, Kirchner stunned the nation by handing the presidential slot to Peronist moderate Fern\u00e1ndez, who had resigned from Kirchner\u2019s government in 2008 to become a critic of her populist style. She reserved the vice-presidential candidacy for herself. Although there is little doubt in people\u2019s minds that it is Kirchner who will call the shots if her party is elected, the implication that her bravado will be kept in check by Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s even temper seems to have convinced middle-class voters. \u201cKirchner kept her share of votes among the poorer people, got 2.5 million votes of the lower middle class from Massa, and the vote of the troubled middle class from Fern\u00e1ndez,\u201d said Zarazaga. Fern\u00e1ndez is also linked in the public\u2019s mind to the economic turnaround during the 2003-07 government of N\u00e9stor Kirchner, in which Fern\u00e1ndez was cabinet chief. Cristina Kirchner\u2019s husband, who died of a heart attack in 2010, successfully steered Argentina out of its 2001 economic debacle, when the country defaulted on its massive foreign debt, poverty rose to 54% of the population, and the currency collapsed. That crisis plunged Argentina into chaos as savers\u2019 accounts were frozen to stop a run on the banks. Dozens died in violent protests and supermarket looting. Today, the whiff of an economic meltdown is again in the air. Macri\u2019s defeat shook the financial markets and sent the peso tumbling, losing 25% of its value against the dollar and adding fuel to Argentina\u2019s already steep inflation rate, the third-highest in the world after Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Macri, a millionaire businessman, is paying a heavy price for failing to deliver on his emphatic promise of zero inflation and zero poverty when he took office in December 2015. Inflation hit 54% over the last 12 months, twice the rate when he took office. Foreign debt has also more than doubled, after a loss of investor confidence in emerging markets forced Macri to seek a $57.1bn rescue package from the IMF last September, the largest loan it has ever handed out. Prices rocketed last week; retailers are battling a deadly combination of inflation and devaluation, which makes it impossible for them to keep pace with the crisis. In one day, the price of a macchiato in the trendy coffee shops of Palermo Soho in the capital rose by nearly 25% in pesos, while at the same time dropping from $1.78 to $1.58. Juan Grabois, a social leader who also has close links with Pope Francis, heads the Movement of Excluded Workers (MTE), a large alliance of people without formal employment. According to him, Argentina\u2019s \u201cnew poor\u201d \u2013 street sellers, trash rummagers \u2013 total about six million people. Grabois agreed that Macri\u2019s Cambiemos party had lost touch with the dire situation of Argentina\u2019s poor workers and middle class. \u201cNow we are facing a crisis similar to the one in 2001,\u201d he said. The only reason Argentina hasn\u2019t descended into the popular unrest and supermarket lootings that marked that crisis is due to the social aid programmes put into place by Kirchner\u2019s government. Although these were heavily criticised by Macri\u2019s party, the president himself has tripled the amount of social aid being handed out to stave off unrest. \u201cThe aid only lasts those who receive it to the middle of the month, with luck, but that\u2019s enough to keep them waiting until the start of the next month rather than taking to the streets,\u201d Grabois said. Grabois criticised as insufficient a string of measures announced by Macri over the course of last week: a reduction in taxes on wages and on essential food items, price controls and the freezing of mortgage payment instalments. He also questioned Macri\u2019s chances of making it to the end of his term this December. Torre, the parish priest in Villa 31, said: \u201cSocial aid is why people have withstood so far and in a way it\u2019s better if it prevents a repetition of the upheaval in 2001.\u201d Grabois said: \u201cIf Macri\u2019s government survives it will be with the support of us, his social and political opposition.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of people have rallied in Sydney in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters, despite warnings from Beijing for foreign governments and protesters to stay clear of the issue. Around 500 to 600 people gathered at Sydney\u2019s Belmore Park on Sunday afternoon, while Hong Kong braced for hundreds of thousands to rally in the central business district. More than two months of protests have seen violent escalations including brutal crackdowns by police who are now frequently deploying teargas and using batons against protesters. Placards in Sydney leaned heavily on concerns over police brutality, with many referencing the first-aid volunteer who was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet fired by Hong Kong police. One speaker who had recently returned from the Hong Kong protests said they were fighting for their \u201cfuture, for democracy, and for the things we used to have\u201d before the 1997 handback of Hong Kong to China. \u201cMany Hong Kongers have bled for such values as we have here in Australia today,\u201d he said. Another speaker outlined the demands now held by the evolving movement: Total withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill, which sparked the protests 11 weeks ago Withdrawal of all accusations against protesters that they engaged in \u201criots\u201d The unconditional release of more than 700 arrested protesters, and all charges dropped The launch of an independent inquiry into police brutality Implementation of universal suffrage for Hong Kong \u201cHong Kong protesters have to face brutality, they have to face jail, they have to face persecution,\u201d which they don\u2019t deserve,\u201d said one woman. Many in the crowd wore face masks, wary of alleged Chinese state surveillance of citizens who publicly supported Hong Kong. One 45-year-old man, who declined to give his name, said he came to the rally out of \u201csupport and solidarity\u201d. \u201cWe are far away from Hong Kong. This is the least I can do. It\u2019s something I need to do for myself as well.\u201d The man said he came to Australia from Hong Kong with his parents in 1986. \u201cIt\u2019s the value. The injustice that Hong Kong teenagers are facing at the moment. They\u2019re treated as outcasts and have no stake in society.\u201d The protest came just a day after China sent a warning to protesters and foreign governments about getting involved in the Hong Kong situation, saying \u201cany attempt to mess up Hong Kong is doomed to fail\u201d. The Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, said protesters in Hong Kong had exhibited \u201cradical, violent and illegal behaviours\u201d which had \u201cgrossly trampled on the rule of law\u201d and threatened lives and Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability. \u201cNo responsible government would sit idly by,\u201d he said. \u201cHong Kong affairs are solely the internal affairs of China.\u201d The Labor party has asked the government to allow all federal parliamentarians to access briefings on China, given the high focus on relations at the moment. Wong said the fact that government backbenchers had been the most vocal with their concerns about the Chinese government and Australia\u2019s relationship with it, was a demonstration that the government had failed to lead the conversation. \u201cWe are at a point where the relationship is more complex and also more consequential,\u201d shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, told Insiders on Sunday morning. \u201cWe should have a more informed debate.\u201d On Friday the Australian prime minister said it was a \u201cconcerning situation\u201d. \u201cAnything I would say would be only to encourage a de-escalation of the situation in Hong Kong, and for those that are protesting to do so peacefully, and for that to be respected,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>Ralph Brown\u2019s <em>Meat Porters</em>, a sculpture of 1959 that was commissioned for Harlow New Town in Essex, really must be seen to be believed \u2013 and from every possible angle. A tribute to physical labour that is said not to have been too popular with some of the more aspirational of the town\u2019s early residents, it depicts two men, strong-looking but rather squat, and a carcass they\u2019re doggedly hauling on their shoulders. From a distance, arms outstretched and backs bent, the piece resembles a huge bat or an umbrella blown out of shape by the wind. But get closer and the effect is even odder. It\u2019s almost sexual: a bizarre threesome at the heart of which, courtesy of the ox\u2019s splayed hind legs, we may peer into a cave-like crevice that is unnervingly and grotesquely human.</p> <p>It would be worth seeing <a href=\"https://www.artfund.org/whats-on/exhibitions/2019/08/17/reflection-british-art-in-an-age-of-change-exhibition\" title=\"\">Reflection: British Art in an Age of Change</a> at the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull for this bronze alone. In Harlow, <em>Meat Porters </em>stands on a plinth, inaccessible as some throne. But at the Ferens it rests on the floor, enabling the visitor to go eye to eye with these muscled geezers and their fleshy cargo. Brown\u2019s sculpture, however, is only one of an embarrassment of riches gathered by the exhibition\u2019s deft and thoughtful curator, James Russell, using work both from the Ferens\u2019 own collection and loans from the <a href=\"http://ingramcollection.com/\" title=\"\">Ingram Collection,</a> one of the largest private collections of modern British art in the UK.</p> <p>How to make people see old and possibly familiar works with new eyes? Russell\u2019s show aims to answer this question, a vital one for any gallery with a permanent collection, via a series of clever juxtapositions: here, the old and the new, the domestic and the outlandish, the seen and the unseen (he has raided the Ferens\u2019 storeroom) cosy up together \u2013 and in doing so throw new light on one another. Far from being the nebulous muddle I\u2019d feared \u2013 after all, it includes 150 pieces, the earliest dating from 1850 and the latest from 2013 \u2013 it is an exhibition that delivers a freshness born largely, though not exclusively, of contrast. It isn\u2019t only that Russell <em>wants</em> you to look. Rather, it\u2019s that he ambushes you into doing so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc24c45209328281cbecd37511a3b93b21d82428\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc24c45209328281cbecd37511a3b93b21d82428/0_0_2702_4252/635.jpg\" alt=\"Meat Porters, Ralph Brown, 1959.\" width=\"635\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meat Porters, Ralph Brown, 1959.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Estate of Ralph Brown. Image courtesy of The Ingram Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Loosely divided into three, it begins with portraits. From here it moves into relationships, work and play and then, finally, into place, with an emphasis on war. Russell\u2019s approach hits you almost immediately. After David Tindle\u2019s marvellously spectral self-portrait of 1991 and <a href=\"http://pictify.saatchigallery.com/1158312/books-and-art-miss-maude-nelke-c1914-sir-william-nicholson\" title=\"\">William Nicholson\u2019s luxuriant painting of the socialite Maud Nelke of 1914</a>, in which the pointed collars of her shirt suggest (as her expression does not, or not quite) a desire to be taken more seriously, are a series of photographs from 2004 by Bettina von Zwehl (b1971), in which four young women, each one dressed in the same white vest, are pictured listening to <em>F\u00fcr Alina</em> by the Estonian composer Arvo P\u00e4rt.</p> <p>They\u2019re lovely images, and clever, too, for the way they make you imagine the music reaching the sitters\u2019 ears (one tune, four different expressions). But then your eye catches sight, right beside them, of <em>Private Coe</em>, 1941, a pastel of a soldier by William Dring (1904-90).</p> <p>I can\u2019t quite explain why I felt so touched by the proximity of these two; perhaps it had something to do with war and peace, the young man in Dring\u2019s picture aiming for smiling nonchalance in the face of great danger, and the four women in Von Zwehl\u2019s photographs looking so sombre when all that is required of them is to sit quietly. But I returned to this corner of the gallery again and again. It pulled me in, like an embrace.</p> <p>Moving on, I loved the series of watercolours in the next room, a highlight of which is <em>Landing of Paratroops, </em>1944, by Albert Richards, who was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-48557272\" title=\"\">killed in action in 1945:</a> a liverish moonscape at which you could stare all day, and one that only seems the more singular given the elevated company it keeps (Paul Nash, Eric Ravilious). I\u2019ve seen Edward Burra\u2019s extended bruise of a watercolour<em>, </em><em><a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/edward-burra/near-whitby-yorkshire-FzGY_YOe3lMXDzp1UNJaKA2\" title=\"\">Near Whitby, Yorkshire,</a></em><a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/edward-burra/near-whitby-yorkshire-FzGY_YOe3lMXDzp1UNJaKA2\" title=\"\"> 1972</a>,<em> </em>before elsewhere, but in this show it benefits amazingly from its closeness to Barbara Rae\u2019s<em> </em>(b1943) <em><a href=\"https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/roadside-castelfiorentino-230503\" title=\"\">Roadside, Castelfiorentino</a></em><em> </em>(not dated), a picture you want almost to crawl into, the better to understand its dusty, magnified effects. Burra\u2019s painting is all weather and heather, the blur divided wittily by white lines marked in a road, while Rae\u2019s stubbornly gives us no sign at all of the way ahead; we could be looking at a Tuscan hillside, or about to run smack into an ancient chapel wall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a4d51c01a4a2a3ddbf5c901f8a03407d9035f57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a4d51c01a4a2a3ddbf5c901f8a03407d9035f57/0_0_2362_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fun Bag, 2015, Victoria Sin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fun Bag, 2015, Victoria Sin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image courtesy of The Ingram Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, do not miss <a href=\"https://www.artuk.org/discover/artworks/bleak-november-233507\" title=\"\">Alan Reynolds\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.artuk.org/discover/artworks/bleak-november-233507\" title=\"\">Bleak November</a></em> (1955-6), which hangs on a wall with <em><a href=\"http://ingramcollection.com/works/temple-industrial-devotion-iv-2016/\" title=\"\">Temple of Industrial Devotion IV,</a></em><a href=\"http://ingramcollection.com/works/temple-industrial-devotion-iv-2016/\" title=\"\"> 2016</a>, by Steven Ingman (b1984). In the first moments that you look at them, these two paintings could not be more different in mood. The former, a rural landscape, is watercolour and gouache; the latter, in oil, depicts a decaying industrial building. Gaze on, however, and their affinities are slowly revealed to you.</p> <p>If Reynolds\u2019s seedpods bring to mind old bones, Ingman\u2019s factory has an equally skeletal air. In his labels, Russell has carefully avoided mention of the moment in which we find ourselves, perhaps because the people of Hull voted so strongly in favour of leaving the EU. But Brexit can be felt all about here, I think, and not only because this is a show that is so keenly interested in difference, human and geographical. Something mournful lurks at its edges. In our past lay our future, if only we had been better able to read the runes.</p> <p><em>\u25cf </em>At <a href=\"https://www.hcandl.co.uk/campaign/reflection-british-art-age-change\">Ferens Art Gallery, Hull</a>, until 5 Jan 2020</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD_gOiehgqo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QD_gOiehgqo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD_gOiehgqo\">Watch a trailer for Reflection: British Art in an Age of Change.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Russell\u2019s show aims to answer this question, a vital one for any gallery with a permanent collection, via a series of clever juxtapositions: here, the old and the new, the domestic and the outlandish, the seen and the unseen (he has raided the Ferens\u2019 storeroom) cosy up together \u2013 and in doing so throw new light on one another. Far from being the nebulous muddle I\u2019d feared \u2013 after all, it includes 150 pieces, the earliest dating from 1850 and the latest from 2013 \u2013 it is an exhibition that delivers a freshness born largely, though not exclusively, of contrast. It isn\u2019t only that Russell wants you to look. Rather, it\u2019s that he ambushes you into doing so. Loosely divided into three, it begins with portraits. From here it moves into relationships, work and play and then, finally, into place, with an emphasis on war. Russell\u2019s approach hits you almost immediately. After David Tindle\u2019s marvellously spectral self-portrait of 1991 and William Nicholson\u2019s luxuriant painting of the socialite Maud Nelke of 1914, in which the pointed collars of her shirt suggest (as her expression does not, or not quite) a desire to be taken more seriously, are a series of photographs from 2004 by Bettina von Zwehl (b1971), in which four young women, each one dressed in the same white vest, are pictured listening to F\u00fcr Alina by the Estonian composer Arvo P\u00e4rt. They\u2019re lovely images, and clever, too, for the way they make you imagine the music reaching the sitters\u2019 ears (one tune, four different expressions). But then your eye catches sight, right beside them, of Private Coe, 1941, a pastel of a soldier by William Dring (1904-90). I can\u2019t quite explain why I felt so touched by the proximity of these two; perhaps it had something to do with war and peace, the young man in Dring\u2019s picture aiming for smiling nonchalance in the face of great danger, and the four women in Von Zwehl\u2019s photographs looking so sombre when all that is required of them is to sit quietly. But I returned to this corner of the gallery again and again. It pulled me in, like an embrace. Moving on, I loved the series of watercolours in the next room, a highlight of which is Landing of Paratroops, 1944, by Albert Richards, who was killed in action in 1945: a liverish moonscape at which you could stare all day, and one that only seems the more singular given the elevated company it keeps (Paul Nash, Eric Ravilious). I\u2019ve seen Edward Burra\u2019s extended bruise of a watercolour, Near Whitby, Yorkshire, 1972, before elsewhere, but in this show it benefits amazingly from its closeness to Barbara Rae\u2019s (b1943) Roadside, Castelfiorentino (not dated), a picture you want almost to crawl into, the better to understand its dusty, magnified effects. Burra\u2019s painting is all weather and heather, the blur divided wittily by white lines marked in a road, while Rae\u2019s stubbornly gives us no sign at all of the way ahead; we could be looking at a Tuscan hillside, or about to run smack into an ancient chapel wall. Finally, do not miss Alan Reynolds\u2019s Bleak November (1955-6), which hangs on a wall with Temple of Industrial Devotion IV, 2016, by Steven Ingman (b1984). In the first moments that you look at them, these two paintings could not be more different in mood. The former, a rural landscape, is watercolour and gouache; the latter, in oil, depicts a decaying industrial building. Gaze on, however, and their affinities are slowly revealed to you. If Reynolds\u2019s seedpods bring to mind old bones, Ingman\u2019s factory has an equally skeletal air. In his labels, Russell has carefully avoided mention of the moment in which we find ourselves, perhaps because the people of Hull voted so strongly in favour of leaving the EU. But Brexit can be felt all about here, I think, and not only because this is a show that is so keenly interested in difference, human and geographical. Something mournful lurks at its edges. In our past lay our future, if only we had been better able to read the runes. \u25cf At Ferens Art Gallery, Hull, until 5 Jan 2020",

      "body": "<p>For many, it is an idea of heaven \u2013 shutting down the computer one last time and leaving the office in the full knowledge that you are financially stable enough never to have to return. And all at an age that most people would consider to be barely midway through their working life.</p> <p>But a growing movement is focused on just that: encouraging people towards a mixture of extreme saving, frugal living and smart investment that will allow them to stop working and put their feet up decades before their peers \u2013 in some cases, when they are still in their 30s. And the Financial Independence, Retire Early (Fire) doctrine claims that people do not need a six-figure salary to get there.</p> <p>At a time when many people are struggling to ensure they have enough money when they do retire or even to get them from month to month, the idea will probably appear absurd. And that is before you hear that it often involves saving between 50% and 75% of post-tax earnings. The advocates of Fire are undaunted, however.</p> <h2>Saving to live a dream<br></h2> <p>Alan Donegan says he achieved his financial independence before turning 40. As a result, he is living his dream by temporarily decamping to Los Angeles to work on his movie screenplay.</p> <p>Along with his partner, he has built up an investment portfolio worth \u00a31m after saving from his income as a consultant on start-ups and from the establishment of a business training school.</p> <p>They now claim that they can support their current lifestyle without having to work. Saving so much is a tall order at any age and Donegan says that instead of spending money, they invested it.</p> <p>\u201cMost people find that as they earn more, they spend more. We didn\u2019t do that. Our motto is \u2018Buy your freedom first,\u2019\u201d he said.</p> <p>They own a two-bed flat in Basingstoke and drive a compact Skoda Citigo, which cost \u00a35,000. \u201cI do like a coffee in a nice cafe, but generally I spend in line with my values,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One of the criticisms of the Fire movement is that it excludes people on low incomes who may find saving any small amount, let alone half their take-home pay, impossible.</p> <p>Donegan admits that saving enough may be a struggle for someone on \u00a315,000 a year, but at \u00a340,000, it is doable if you are willing to change your life and spending habits. But not everyone is.</p> <p>\u201cIt can actually be harder for people with big incomes and spendy lifestyles to actually get to financial independence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The resulting freedom makes the early sacrifices worthwhile, according to Donegan. \u201cMy dreams of becoming a screenwriter may never come true, but at least I\u2019m free to give it a go,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>But how can you do it?</h2> <p>So how much do you need to be retirement-ready? According to the principles of Fire, the target is a pot of money worth 25 times your annual spending \u2013 not salary.</p> <p>So if you can get by on \u00a310,000 a year, you need \u00a3250,000. If you need \u00a340,000, your target is a cool \u00a31m.</p> <p>The more you save, the faster you will get there. If you set aside 10% of your income, it would take 51 years to build savings worth 25 times your income, according to Pete Adeney, a Canadian personal finance blogger known as Mr Money Mustache, who is a standard-bearer for Fire. Increase that to 15%, and you could retire eight years sooner, he said.</p> <p>If you can save 50% of your income, you can hit that 25 times target in 17 years. At 75%, it falls to just seven years.</p> <p>Underpinning this is something called the 4% rule, set out in a 1998 paper by three professors at Trinity University, Texas, which states that if you keep your pot of money invested in stocks and shares you can live off the \u201csafe withdrawal rate\u201d of 4% a year and your money will never run out, although you may need to spend less during recessions.</p> <p>The \u201cmovement\u201d encourages followers to invest in low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with the Vanguard fund range particularly popular, as charges can be as low as 0.06% a year, against 1.5% on some actively managed funds.</p> <p>This minor difference adds up over time \u2013 if you invested \u00a3100,000 and it grew 6% a year for 30 years, you would have \u00a3374,532 with annual fund charges of 1.5% a year. If the fund charged 0.06%, you would have \u00a3564,676. That\u2019s \u00a3190,144 more, purely due to charges.</p> <h2>Growing influence<br></h2> <p>Damien Fahy, director of the personal finance website <a href=\"https://moneytothemasses.com/\" title=\"\">MoneyToTheMasses.com</a>, said Fire was going mainstream, particularly among millennials. \u201cIt is an extreme version of traditional financial planning, wrapped up in an almost cult-like movement.\u201d</p> <p>However, he questioned whether the 4% rule was sustainable if you were retiring in your 40s or even 50s, as your money would have to last for four or five decades, and a lengthy stock market slump or financial emergency could throw your plans off course.</p> <p>The safe withdrawal rate assumes inflation at 3% and an average investment return of 7%, which is by no means assured.</p> <p>\u201cIf your money starts running out, you might struggle to return to the workplace if you\u2019ve been out of it for a long time or ill,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Stephen Lowe, communications director at retirement advisers Just Group, said the vast majority of people were not saving enough to retire at 65, let alone 45.</p> <p>\u201cFor most, Fire is little more than an abstract idea but if it captures people\u2019s imagination, that\u2019s got to be a good thing,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>It\u2019s not for everyone<br></h2> <p>Lynn James, who writes the <a href=\"https://www.mrsmummypenny.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mrs Moneypenny</a> blog, argues that Fire is only realistic \u201cif you have a big salary, low mortgage and no children\u201d. And not everybody wants to spend their 20s being frugal. \u201cAt that age I wanted to travel the world, eat amazing food, go to concerts and experience life.\u201d</p> <p>James\u2019s parents died aged just 58 and 63, before spending any of the money they saved, and that has made her sceptical about planning too far ahead. \u201cIt is totally sensible to save more when you\u2019re young, but also life is for living.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie Jenkins, head of global savings policy at Standard Life Aberdeen, said Fire was beyond most people\u2019s reach, but the underlying principles of financial discipline were good. \u201cEveryone should be looking to save around 15% of their salary into a pension, more if possible,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another argument against the movement is that work gives value and purpose to many people\u2019s lives, and retiring early may leave a void as a result.</p> <p>Fire has its critics but makes sense to Fiona Silk, 40, a landscape designer from Penge. \u201cA large part is about reduced consumption and mindful purchases, rather than blowing cash on things that are ultimately meaningless. That all that gets lost in the furore about retiring early.\u201d</p> <p>With a current net worth of well under \u00a3100,000, Fiona did not expect to be able to retire early. \u201cHowever, there is a good chance I won\u2019t have to bust my guts until 65, and will be free to take on less work or more meaningful work. Others might reach that freedom much earlier, if they don\u2019t blow their pay on booze, holidays and meals like I did when I was younger.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bc09fdf1614eabd61514d3408d71c63952b7488d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc09fdf1614eabd61514d3408d71c63952b7488d/585_1279_5333_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alvar Damen is saving \u00a31,500 a month towards the goal of early retirement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alvar Damen is saving \u00a31,500 a month towards the goal of early retirement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Minimal living to the max</h2> <p>At the age of 26, Alvar Damen is saving \u00a31,500 a month towards retirement but would like to go even further.</p> <p>\u201cMy aim is to earn as much as possible, spend the minimum and save the maximum. That way I can be financially free sooner rather than later,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Dutch national has lived in Edinburgh for two years and has a podcast called Financial Independence Europe. He benefits from rent of \u00a3675 a month, considered low for the centre of Edinburgh. \u201cI walk everywhere, including to work, so I don\u2019t need a car.\u201d</p> <p>He also avoids wasting his earnings from his IT job and side projects on \u201citty-bitty things\u201d. \u201cI keep recurring bills down such as energy and insurance, pick up money hacks at Moneysavingexpert.com, and shop at Lidl,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Damen invests his \u00a31,500 into an index tracker fund from Vanguard, which invests in a spread of global stocks with an annual charge of 0.25%.</p> <p>He uses his tax-free Isa allowance and is saving for a property deposit using the Lifetime Isa, which pays a 25% government-funded bonus worth up to \u00a31,000 a year, if you save the maximum \u00a34,000 (which he does).</p> <p>Damen\u2019s aim isn\u2019t to stop working, but to achieve freedom. \u201cSo if I don\u2019t like my boss, I could take on a less stressful job, or something less commercial.

He benefits from rent of \u00a3675 a month, considered low for the centre of Edinburgh. \u201cI walk everywhere, including to work, so I don\u2019t need a car.\u201d He also avoids wasting his earnings from his IT job and side projects on \u201citty-bitty things\u201d. \u201cI keep recurring bills down such as energy and insurance, pick up money hacks at Moneysavingexpert.com, and shop at Lidl,\u201d he says. Damen invests his \u00a31,500 into an index tracker fund from Vanguard, which invests in a spread of global stocks with an annual charge of 0.25%. He uses his tax-free Isa allowance and is saving for a property deposit using the Lifetime Isa, which pays a 25% government-funded bonus worth up to \u00a31,000 a year, if you save the maximum \u00a34,000 (which he does). Damen\u2019s aim isn\u2019t to stop working, but to achieve freedom. \u201cSo if I don\u2019t like my boss, I could take on a less stressful job, or something less commercial. If you\u2019re financially independent, you can do whatever you want.\u201d He still wants children, even if they are costly. He says: \u201cYou might have to work a few more years, or save a bit less, but it can be done.\u201d",

But it wasn\u2019t necessarily advice, it was that they were willing to spend time with me and share. Before that\u2026 well, usually we women have to tell our stories in a safe way, because people often want to persecute us for being sexually free.\u201d</p> <p>The three women were all married and all actors: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/salma-hayek\" title=\"\">Salma Hayek</a>, Pauletta Washington (married to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/denzelwashington\" title=\"\">Denzel</a>) and Ruby Dee, and these conversations about marriage and relationships, with which she was really struggling, led Pinkett Smith to believe that there was room for such intimate chats to take place on a bigger stage. An actor herself \u2013 she had been a star in the 1990s, starting out on the <em>Cosby</em> spinoff-series <em>A Different World</em>, co-starring in <em>The Nutty Professor</em> with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/eddiemurphy\" title=\"\">Eddie Murphy</a>, and later in the <em>Matrix</em> franchise \u2013 Pinkett Smith had spent many years feeling frustrated by her position as wife to the more successful husband. She says: \u201cI forgot who Jada was.\u201d She put her family\u2019s needs first and forgot her own, while Will roamed the world, a megastar applauded by millions. They didn\u2019t exactly break up, but during the bad patch she moved to New York on her own for a while, to find herself.</p> <p>They first met when they were barely adults; he was starring in <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</em> and she was on <em>A Different World</em>. They later married and had two children, Jaden and Willow. \u201cI knew that I was not built for conventional marriage,\u201d she explains. \u201cEven the word \u2018wife\u2019: it\u2019s a golden cage, swallow the key. Even before I was married, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll kill me.\u2019 And it damn near did! So why wouldn\u2019t you share what you\u2019ve been through, when you see that other people are out there, trying to figure this crap out? We decided to make it public because it\u2019s part of the healing. I feel like if we don\u2019t have real understanding about it, I don\u2019t know if interpersonal relationships are possible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"431d14517c59b34fec55ef1962959d845306c8ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/431d14517c59b34fec55ef1962959d845306c8ca/0_235_7368_4420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jada wears roll-neck by versace.com; body suit worn underneath by nubianskin.com.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jada wears roll-neck by <a href=\"https://www.versace.com/gb/en-gb/home/\">versace.com</a>; body suit worn underneath by <a href=\"https://www.nubianskin.com/\">nubianskin.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Hetherington/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They clearly dote on their children, and she stresses the strength of their union, too. \u201cWill is my life partner and I could not ask for a better one. I adore him, I never want people to think it was <em>Will</em> I didn\u2019t want to marry \u2013 he and I were talking about this the other day. But I can assure you that some of the most powerful women in the world feel caged and tied, because of the sacrifices they have to make to be in that position. So I wanted to talk about how we really feel about marriage. How do we really feel about different, unconventional relationships? How do we really feel about raising children? Honestly.\u201d</p> <p>Which is why, in <em>Red Table Talk</em>, you will hear some really quite startling conversations. The first one involves Jada sitting down to talk to Will\u2019s first wife, Sheree, mother of his eldest child, Trey. When the two of them discuss how hard it was to find a way to co-parent at the start, with the children going between the two houses, and how Jada hadn\u2019t realised that she was marrying someone whose first marriage wasn\u2019t really over, you can hear a pin drop. Sheree recalls a time when she called Jada\u2019s house to speak to her son, and Jada didn\u2019t like her tone, so she put the phone down on her. Ouch. Yet the conversation clearly liberates the two of them from some very old feelings. Jada tells me that it brought them closer together; Will has said that there is some \u201ctransformational magic that occurs when people sit down at the Red Table\u201d.</p> <p>The usual set-up is this: Jada, Willow and Adrienne sit round the table, usually accompanied by a guest, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kristin-davis\" title=\"\">Kristin Davis</a>, who played Charlotte in<em> Sex and the City</em> and who came on to discuss why she adopted a black child as a white woman, and to hear what feelings this can stir up in black women. Or Jordyn Woods, vilified by the Kardashians for her involvement with the father of one of their children, who came on to explain what really happened, and how her life has since been torn apart by public crucifixion via social media. Key to it, though, is the inter-generational axis of mother, grandmother and daughter, who manage to discuss their thoughts on porn, threesomes and love with a level of dignity that I tell Jada astonishes me \u2013 I think I\u2019d die from squirming before having those conversations with my own family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd79d90f9f2a300335aaae4a6493390fcb5f7a95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd79d90f9f2a300335aaae4a6493390fcb5f7a95/0_0_7368_9216/799.jpg\" alt=\"Jada wears white dress by brunellocucinelli.com; belt with gold detail by bottegaveneta.com; and earrings  by shaunleane.com\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jada wears white dress by <a href=\"http://brunellocucinelli.com\">brunellocucinelli.com</a>; belt with gold detail by <a href=\"http://bottegaveneta.com\">bottegaveneta.com</a>; and earrings by <a href=\"http://shaunleane.com\">shaunleane.com</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Hetherington/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jada will reveal, for example, that she spent several years addicted to porn and felt it had to stop when she was climaxing five separate times a day. Her mother will nod. Yet she tells me she was actually deeply uncomfortable. \u201cI think the pornography show was the first time I got squeamish talking with my mother. Not so much Willow, because we had already talked about it.\u201d Willow had shown her mum her Tumblr feed (a collection of blogs that she followed online) when she was about 11, only for deeply unsuitable material to flash up that Willow, now 18, insisted had nothing to do with her. \u201cSo she\u2019s flippin\u2019, flippin\u2019, flippin\u2019 and some of the most hardcore pornography came up and I was just like \u2013 \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019 So the first time I had to talk to her about it was then. She was so used to it, she couldn\u2019t understand why I was trippin\u2019 about it. So then I had to go, \u2018When was the first time you saw it? How did it make you feel? You have to know that this is not lovemaking, right?\u2019\u201d Then she laughs. \u201cI also told her, you know what I had to go through to get some porn!\u201d It was her older brothers who had first shown her it, \u201cand older siblings expose younger siblings to everything. I think every kid today is introduced to sex through porn.\u201d</p> <p>Which is why there is such a need for these frank, urgent conversations. A community has built up around the show on Facebook, with thousands of users discussing their own lives in the comments section. Pinkett Smith admits to me that she has a fake Facebook identity she uses to log in and encourage them, something I find hysterically funny, though she assures me she doesn\u2019t log in to say how great Jada Pinkett Smith is. One of the reasons she decided to take this show to social media, rather than mainstream television, is that after a round of pitching meetings, Pinkett Smith felt that only the Silicon Valley giant was offering true flexibility with the content. \u201cThe others all wanted to add a dancing bear to it. <em>So</em> many dancing bears, when I just wanted us sitting around a table. And the other reason I couldn\u2019t go to mainstream TV is that Willow is not built for that kind of conventional set-up. She can\u2019t be there every episode \u2013 she\u2019s a little butterfly. Something comes up and she says, \u2018Ma I got to go to the mountains for a week,\u2019 and I got to let her go. That\u2019s part of her mental health, she needs freedom. You\u2019ve just got to let her fly.\u201d Her brother Jaden, 21, has appeared, but is generally \u201ctoo busy, he\u2019s busier than any of us, he can\u2019t sit still for more than a day,\u201d with his music, not to mention his new career as a tech inventor. (He has described himself as \u201cobsessed with water\u201d and has created a new filtration system to help the people of Flint, Michigan, who have lived without access to an uncontaminated supply for years.)</p> <p>We learn, through <em>Red Table Talk</em>, that when Willow became a child star with her hit single, Whip My Hair, when she was nine, she soon went off the idea, but couldn\u2019t get her father to hear her pleas. Will admits he was so determined to turn her into a star, the youngest artist to sign to his friend Jay-Z\u2019s label, that he wouldn\u2019t let her stop touring. Willow and Jaden ended up giving a joint interview to the <em>New York Times</em>, after which the internet had a good laugh about their cosmic musings on the nature of reality. I ask Jada how she feels about it all now.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very tough period,\u201d she admits. \u201cThey had to grow up really fast. But, you know, we all have our crosses to bear and I\u2019d rather have to deal with Twitter trolls than be these mothers on the streets of Baltimore worrying about gun violence and getting my kids home safe.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f39e8e5384a63456eebc904a8c2757e78f952171\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f39e8e5384a63456eebc904a8c2757e78f952171/0_0_5632_3380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Three of the best: Jada Pinkett Smith with her daughter Willow and mother on Red Table Talk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Three of the best: Jada Pinkett Smith with her daughter Willow and mother Adrienne on Red Table Talk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Evans</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not a comparison she makes flippantly; it is the life she could have lived, having been raised there herself, her single mother Adrienne giving birth to her while still at high school in Baltimore, before she (Adrienne) became a heroin addict for 20 years. Pinkett Smith, whose own children have grown up with a swimming pool, an in-house vegan chef and been privately educated alongside the Kardashians, admits she sometimes struggles \u201cto relate to my children\u2019s problems, because of how they have grown up. Survival is not an issue, so what is?\u201d</p> <p>Her love for them is palpable; so is the pain in her face when she admits she doesn\u2019t really understand her own problems either. \u201cWhen I think about my life experience and equate it to the amount of pain that I feel \u2013 it doesn\u2019t match, it doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d She adds that \u201ctrauma is a plague,\u201d and that the African-American experience carries the burden of generational traumas, \u201con top of present times\u201d.</p> <p>Yet she clearly suffered a lot: her mother is known in the family as \u201cGammy\u201d and is such a cheeky, grinning, calm presence on the show it is still surprising when she talks about her junkie years. Jada says they are exactly why her mother, to whom the show has brought her closer, is so good at being on it; so able to sit through uncomfortable conversations. \u201cBeing a recovering addict, she\u2019s had to do a lot of self-evaluation, even outside of the therapy. She\u2019s gone beyond, \u2018Ugh, I feel so ashamed\u2019 into: \u2018It is what it is,\u2019 and she has a lot of resolve about what it means to be the child of addicts. She also knows my healing is my responsibility and that it\u2019s up to me to handle my co-dependent issues, because I\u2019m deeply co-dependent.\u201d</p> <p>With her? With Will?</p> <p>\u201cWith everybody! It\u2019s what got me into the dynamic of the relationship I have with Will. You know, you start off thinking, \u2018It\u2019s his fault, if he hadn\u2019t\u2026\u2019 No, no, no \u2013 nobody put a gun to your head, Missy. What was your responsibility in this? Cos your ass is co-dependent, that\u2019s what.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"574a5f4a65a35ad592c07e0f08b9dcab504ce9cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/574a5f4a65a35ad592c07e0f08b9dcab504ce9cf/154_59_3107_1863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jada in a line-up with her family, Trey, Jaden, Willow and Will Smith.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If we don\u2019t have real understanding about it, I don\u2019t know if interpersonal relationships are possible\u2019: Jada with her family (from left) Trey, Jaden, Willow and Will Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Randy Shropshire/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask what Will thinks of the show. \u201cHe loves it!

If I were, I would have no problem saying it.\u201d She says she has studied many religions, including taking a few classes in Scientology, and has a library at home full of books about all faiths, but has opted for none of them. She attributes this to being partly raised by her own grandmother \u201cwho was a remarkable West Indian woman, from Jamaica, and very spiritual, but she did not believe in organised religion. She took us to the <a href=\"https://phillyethics.org/\" title=\"\">Ethical Society of Philadelphia</a>.\u201d The organisation championed a free-thinking humanism. \u201cCan you imagine, a black family that didn\u2019t go to church?\u201d Jada cackles with joy at the memory of her unconventional grandmother. \u201cShe told us: \u2018You choose your God\u2019 \u2013 so I don\u2019t have one.\u201d</p> <p>Later that night, Pinkett Smith will appear on stage at an event in London, interviewed by the BBC presenter Clara Amfo, who will ask her about possible future guests on her show. \u201cMeghan Markle\u2019s got to call me!\u201d Pinkett Smith will laugh, to huge cheers from the audience. \u201cBut only when she\u2019s got a story to tell.\u201d</p> <p><em>Makeup by Liz Pugh at Premier Hair and Makeup using Westman Atelier Lit Up Highlighter Stick, \u00a344, and Baby Cheeks Blush stick in Dou Dou, \u00a346, both <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/\">net-a-porter.com</a>; hair by Ben Talbott at the Wall Group using Color Wow; photographer\u2019s assistant Liam Bundy; digital by Andrew Mayfield; fashion assistant Peter Bevan.</em></p> <p><em>New episodes of Red Table Talk will be available exclusively on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/\" title=\"\">Facebook </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/\" title=\"\">Watch</a> in September</em></p>",

Before that\u2026 well, usually we women have to tell our stories in a safe way, because people often want to persecute us for being sexually free.\u201d The three women were all married and all actors: Salma Hayek, Pauletta Washington (married to Denzel) and Ruby Dee, and these conversations about marriage and relationships, with which she was really struggling, led Pinkett Smith to believe that there was room for such intimate chats to take place on a bigger stage. An actor herself \u2013 she had been a star in the 1990s, starting out on the Cosby spinoff-series A Different World, co-starring in The Nutty Professor with Eddie Murphy, and later in the Matrix franchise \u2013 Pinkett Smith had spent many years feeling frustrated by her position as wife to the more successful husband. She says: \u201cI forgot who Jada was.\u201d She put her family\u2019s needs first and forgot her own, while Will roamed the world, a megastar applauded by millions. They didn\u2019t exactly break up, but during the bad patch she moved to New York on her own for a while, to find herself. They first met when they were barely adults; he was starring in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air and she was on A Different World. They later married and had two children, Jaden and Willow. \u201cI knew that I was not built for conventional marriage,\u201d she explains. \u201cEven the word \u2018wife\u2019: it\u2019s a golden cage, swallow the key. Even before I was married, I was like, \u2018That\u2019ll kill me.\u2019 And it damn near did! So why wouldn\u2019t you share what you\u2019ve been through, when you see that other people are out there, trying to figure this crap out? We decided to make it public because it\u2019s part of the healing. I feel like if we don\u2019t have real understanding about it, I don\u2019t know if interpersonal relationships are possible.\u201d They clearly dote on their children, and she stresses the strength of their union, too. \u201cWill is my life partner and I could not ask for a better one. I adore him, I never want people to think it was Will I didn\u2019t want to marry \u2013 he and I were talking about this the other day. But I can assure you that some of the most powerful women in the world feel caged and tied, because of the sacrifices they have to make to be in that position. So I wanted to talk about how we really feel about marriage. How do we really feel about different, unconventional relationships? How do we really feel about raising children? Honestly.\u201d Which is why, in Red Table Talk, you will hear some really quite startling conversations. The first one involves Jada sitting down to talk to Will\u2019s first wife, Sheree, mother of his eldest child, Trey. When the two of them discuss how hard it was to find a way to co-parent at the start, with the children going between the two houses, and how Jada hadn\u2019t realised that she was marrying someone whose first marriage wasn\u2019t really over, you can hear a pin drop. Sheree recalls a time when she called Jada\u2019s house to speak to her son, and Jada didn\u2019t like her tone, so she put the phone down on her. Ouch. Yet the conversation clearly liberates the two of them from some very old feelings. Jada tells me that it brought them closer together; Will has said that there is some \u201ctransformational magic that occurs when people sit down at the Red Table\u201d. The usual set-up is this: Jada, Willow and Adrienne sit round the table, usually accompanied by a guest, such as Kristin Davis, who played Charlotte in Sex and the City and who came on to discuss why she adopted a black child as a white woman, and to hear what feelings this can stir up in black women. Or Jordyn Woods, vilified by the Kardashians for her involvement with the father of one of their children, who came on to explain what really happened, and how her life has since been torn apart by public crucifixion via social media. Key to it, though, is the inter-generational axis of mother, grandmother and daughter, who manage to discuss their thoughts on porn, threesomes and love with a level of dignity that I tell Jada astonishes me \u2013 I think I\u2019d die from squirming before having those conversations with my own family. Jada will reveal, for example, that she spent several years addicted to porn and felt it had to stop when she was climaxing five separate times a day. Her mother will nod. Yet she tells me she was actually deeply uncomfortable. \u201cI think the pornography show was the first time I got squeamish talking with my mother. Not so much Willow, because we had already talked about it.\u201d Willow had shown her mum her Tumblr feed (a collection of blogs that she followed online) when she was about 11, only for deeply unsuitable material to flash up that Willow, now 18, insisted had nothing to do with her. \u201cSo she\u2019s flippin\u2019, flippin\u2019, flippin\u2019 and some of the most hardcore pornography came up and I was just like \u2013 \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019 So the first time I had to talk to her about it was then. She was so used to it, she couldn\u2019t understand why I was trippin\u2019 about it. So then I had to go, \u2018When was the first time you saw it? How did it make you feel? You have to know that this is not lovemaking, right?\u2019\u201d Then she laughs. \u201cI also told her, you know what I had to go through to get some porn!\u201d It was her older brothers who had first shown her it, \u201cand older siblings expose younger siblings to everything. I think every kid today is introduced to sex through porn.\u201d Which is why there is such a need for these frank, urgent conversations. A community has built up around the show on Facebook, with thousands of users discussing their own lives in the comments section. Pinkett Smith admits to me that she has a fake Facebook identity she uses to log in and encourage them, something I find hysterically funny, though she assures me she doesn\u2019t log in to say how great Jada Pinkett Smith is. One of the reasons she decided to take this show to social media, rather than mainstream television, is that after a round of pitching meetings, Pinkett Smith felt that only the Silicon Valley giant was offering true flexibility with the content. \u201cThe others all wanted to add a dancing bear to it. So many dancing bears, when I just wanted us sitting around a table. And the other reason I couldn\u2019t go to mainstream TV is that Willow is not built for that kind of conventional set-up. She can\u2019t be there every episode \u2013 she\u2019s a little butterfly. Something comes up and she says, \u2018Ma I got to go to the mountains for a week,\u2019 and I got to let her go. That\u2019s part of her mental health, she needs freedom. You\u2019ve just got to let her fly.\u201d Her brother Jaden, 21, has appeared, but is generally \u201ctoo busy, he\u2019s busier than any of us, he can\u2019t sit still for more than a day,\u201d with his music, not to mention his new career as a tech inventor. (He has described himself as \u201cobsessed with water\u201d and has created a new filtration system to help the people of Flint, Michigan, who have lived without access to an uncontaminated supply for years.) We learn, through Red Table Talk, that when Willow became a child star with her hit single, Whip My Hair, when she was nine, she soon went off the idea, but couldn\u2019t get her father to hear her pleas. Will admits he was so determined to turn her into a star, the youngest artist to sign to his friend Jay-Z\u2019s label, that he wouldn\u2019t let her stop touring. Willow and Jaden ended up giving a joint interview to the New York Times, after which the internet had a good laugh about their cosmic musings on the nature of reality. I ask Jada how she feels about it all now. \u201cIt was a very tough period,\u201d she admits. \u201cThey had to grow up really fast. But, you know, we all have our crosses to bear and I\u2019d rather have to deal with Twitter trolls than be these mothers on the streets of Baltimore worrying about gun violence and getting my kids home safe.\u201d It is not a comparison she makes flippantly; it is the life she could have lived, having been raised there herself, her single mother Adrienne giving birth to her while still at high school in Baltimore, before she (Adrienne) became a heroin addict for 20 years. Pinkett Smith, whose own children have grown up with a swimming pool, an in-house vegan chef and been privately educated alongside the Kardashians, admits she sometimes struggles \u201cto relate to my children\u2019s problems, because of how they have grown up. Survival is not an issue, so what is?\u201d Her love for them is palpable; so is the pain in her face when she admits she doesn\u2019t really understand her own problems either. \u201cWhen I think about my life experience and equate it to the amount of pain that I feel \u2013 it doesn\u2019t match, it doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d She adds that \u201ctrauma is a plague,\u201d and that the African-American experience carries the burden of generational traumas, \u201con top of present times\u201d. Yet she clearly suffered a lot: her mother is known in the family as \u201cGammy\u201d and is such a cheeky, grinning, calm presence on the show it is still surprising when she talks about her junkie years. Jada says they are exactly why her mother, to whom the show has brought her closer, is so good at being on it; so able to sit through uncomfortable conversations. \u201cBeing a recovering addict, she\u2019s had to do a lot of self-evaluation, even outside of the therapy. She\u2019s gone beyond, \u2018Ugh, I feel so ashamed\u2019 into: \u2018It is what it is,\u2019 and she has a lot of resolve about what it means to be the child of addicts. She also knows my healing is my responsibility and that it\u2019s up to me to handle my co-dependent issues, because I\u2019m deeply co-dependent.\u201d With her? With Will? \u201cWith everybody! It\u2019s what got me into the dynamic of the relationship I have with Will. You know, you start off thinking, \u2018It\u2019s his fault, if he hadn\u2019t\u2026\u2019 No, no, no \u2013 nobody put a gun to your head, Missy. What was your responsibility in this? Cos your ass is co-dependent, that\u2019s what.\u201d I ask what Will thinks of the show. \u201cHe loves it! He thinks I\u2019ve finally, really found a place for my voice.\u201d She is also acting again, and has a new movie coming out this month, Angel Has Fallen, a terrorist thriller with Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman. Oh and \u2013 one more thing \u2013 that rumour about you being a Scientologist? \u201cOh I know everybody keeps wanting to make me into one, but I\u2019m not. If I were, I would have no problem saying it.\u201d She says she has studied many religions, including taking a few classes in Scientology, and has a library at home full of books about all faiths, but has opted for none of them. She attributes this to being partly raised by her own grandmother \u201cwho was a remarkable West Indian woman, from Jamaica, and very spiritual, but she did not believe in organised religion. She took us to the Ethical Society of Philadelphia.\u201d The organisation championed a free-thinking humanism. \u201cCan you imagine, a black family that didn\u2019t go to church?\u201d Jada cackles with joy at the memory of her unconventional grandmother. \u201cShe told us: \u2018You choose your God\u2019 \u2013 so I don\u2019t have one.\u201d Later that night, Pinkett Smith will appear on stage at an event in London, interviewed by the BBC presenter Clara Amfo, who will ask her about possible future guests on her show. \u201cMeghan Markle\u2019s got to call me!\u201d Pinkett Smith will laugh, to huge cheers from the audience. \u201cBut only when she\u2019s got a story to tell.\u201d Makeup by Liz Pugh at Premier Hair and Makeup using Westman Atelier Lit Up Highlighter Stick, \u00a344, and Baby Cheeks Blush stick in Dou Dou, \u00a346, both net-a-porter.com; hair by Ben Talbott at the Wall Group using Color Wow; photographer\u2019s assistant Liam Bundy; digital by Andrew Mayfield; fashion assistant Peter Bevan.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s hardly surprising that this, perhaps the most \u201cTarantino-esque\u201d of all Quentin Tarantino\u2019s movies to date, is a love letter to Hollywood. Who has been more vocal about his passion for the movies, in all their glorious (and inglourious) variety, than Tarantino? And who has been more promiscuous with his affections, flirting with everything from grindhouse and exploitation flicks to martial arts, westerns and second world war adventures?</p> <p>But cinema is a notoriously fickle mistress. And Tarantino is a man who clearly relishes the concept of revenge. <em>Once Upon a Time </em><em>in Hollywood</em>, a film that is as much about the movie industry as it is about the Manson family crimes that rocked it, is a work of infatuation, certainly. But if it\u2019s a love letter, it\u2019s the kind tinged with the grasping anguish and stab of bitterness that comes from knowing that the object of affection is almost certainly eyeing up a new favourite.</p> <p>Success in Hollywood comes with built-in obsolescence. It\u2019s an industry with a vampiric appetite for fresh blood. Actor Rick Dalton (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/05/can-leonardo-dicaprio-and-brad-pitt-save-hollywood\" title=\"\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, signposting the character\u2019s vulnerability with a slight stutter) knows this, but that doesn\u2019t make it any easier to swallow. Formerly the lead in a wild west vigilante TV series, by 1969 Rick has already started the slow slide into bad guy bit-parts and bourbon bloat. As a guest on new shows, he allows himself to be bested each episode by the actors who are positioned as his replacements. Wet-eyed with self-pity after a straight-talking producer lays out a road map for his irrelevance, Rick hides behind the sunglasses of his confidant and former stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Their friendship is a constant in an uncertain world. Their fates are linked: \u201cMore than a buddy, less than a wife,\u201d is how the film\u2019s narration puts it.</p> <p>That fear of no longer being current, no longer getting the calls is something that infects everyone who works in the movie industry to some degree or another. And you suspect that Tarantino himself is not immune to it. A scene in which an awestruck child whispers to Rick: \u201cThat was the best acting I have ever seen\u201d is milked for manly tears. Meanwhile, young people with a less reverent approach to their elders are dealt with swiftly and efficiently, with the kind of sound design that emphasises the crunch of righteous fist into puny, snickering hippy jaws.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13c584fd1f01622529162383f3697972c18b8704\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13c584fd1f01622529162383f3697972c18b8704/0_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Depth and subtlety\u2019: Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a film set in a stunningly evoked Hollywood past. It can also be read as a commentary on Hollywood present. It\u2019s a present that has skewed dramatically over the past couple of years, in which the balance of power has started to shift. And an industry that has started to hold itself to account. With that in mind, Tarantino\u2019s decision to engineer audience support and sympathy for a character whose career has stalled because of allegations of violence against a woman feels like a deliberate provocation and a petulant dig at the #MeToo movement.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t help that the female characters tend towards the schematic and stereotypical. Through sheer force of charm, Margot Robbie invests Sharon Tate, Rick Dalton\u2019s Cielo Drive neighbour, with more depth and subtlety than the gilded, angelic ideal that is sketched on the page. With two notable exceptions \u2013 Margaret Qualley\u2019s star-making skittish Manson girl and Julia Butters\u2019s precocious child actor \u2013 the majority of the other female characters fall into the categories of either shrews or witches.</p> <p>It\u2019s this \u2013 the positioning of middle-aged white males as the real victims here, goddammit \u2013 that rankles. Together with a troubling ending that, at the director\u2019s request, can\u2019t be discussed, it makes the indulgences less easy to forgive. And there are many indulgences: the baggy first hour; the unwieldy two-tier flashback that sets up Cliff\u2019s backstory; the jarring scene featuring Damian Lewis as a polyester version of Steve McQueen; the cheap shot at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/30/bruce-lee-daughter-father-portrayal-quentin-tarantino-film-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood\" title=\"\">Bruce Lee</a>.</p> <p>But, equally, there is much here that represents a film-maker at the top of his game. The delight he takes in the details that anchor the story in time and place: who else but Tarantino would include entire montages dedicated to vintage fonts?

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s hardly surprising that this, perhaps the most \u201cTarantino-esque\u201d of all Quentin Tarantino\u2019s movies to date, is a love letter to Hollywood. Who has been more vocal about his passion for the movies, in all their glorious (and inglourious) variety, than Tarantino? And who has been more promiscuous with his affections, flirting with everything from grindhouse and exploitation flicks to martial arts, westerns and second world war adventures? But cinema is a notoriously fickle mistress. And Tarantino is a man who clearly relishes the concept of revenge. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, a film that is as much about the movie industry as it is about the Manson family crimes that rocked it, is a work of infatuation, certainly. But if it\u2019s a love letter, it\u2019s the kind tinged with the grasping anguish and stab of bitterness that comes from knowing that the object of affection is almost certainly eyeing up a new favourite. Success in Hollywood comes with built-in obsolescence. It\u2019s an industry with a vampiric appetite for fresh blood. Actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio, signposting the character\u2019s vulnerability with a slight stutter) knows this, but that doesn\u2019t make it any easier to swallow. Formerly the lead in a wild west vigilante TV series, by 1969 Rick has already started the slow slide into bad guy bit-parts and bourbon bloat. As a guest on new shows, he allows himself to be bested each episode by the actors who are positioned as his replacements. Wet-eyed with self-pity after a straight-talking producer lays out a road map for his irrelevance, Rick hides behind the sunglasses of his confidant and former stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Their friendship is a constant in an uncertain world. Their fates are linked: \u201cMore than a buddy, less than a wife,\u201d is how the film\u2019s narration puts it. That fear of no longer being current, no longer getting the calls is something that infects everyone who works in the movie industry to some degree or another. And you suspect that Tarantino himself is not immune to it. A scene in which an awestruck child whispers to Rick: \u201cThat was the best acting I have ever seen\u201d is milked for manly tears. Meanwhile, young people with a less reverent approach to their elders are dealt with swiftly and efficiently, with the kind of sound design that emphasises the crunch of righteous fist into puny, snickering hippy jaws. This is a film set in a stunningly evoked Hollywood past. It can also be read as a commentary on Hollywood present. It\u2019s a present that has skewed dramatically over the past couple of years, in which the balance of power has started to shift. And an industry that has started to hold itself to account. With that in mind, Tarantino\u2019s decision to engineer audience support and sympathy for a character whose career has stalled because of allegations of violence against a woman feels like a deliberate provocation and a petulant dig at the #MeToo movement. It doesn\u2019t help that the female characters tend towards the schematic and stereotypical. Through sheer force of charm, Margot Robbie invests Sharon Tate, Rick Dalton\u2019s Cielo Drive neighbour, with more depth and subtlety than the gilded, angelic ideal that is sketched on the page. With two notable exceptions \u2013 Margaret Qualley\u2019s star-making skittish Manson girl and Julia Butters\u2019s precocious child actor \u2013 the majority of the other female characters fall into the categories of either shrews or witches. It\u2019s this \u2013 the positioning of middle-aged white males as the real victims here, goddammit \u2013 that rankles. Together with a troubling ending that, at the director\u2019s request, can\u2019t be discussed, it makes the indulgences less easy to forgive. And there are many indulgences: the baggy first hour; the unwieldy two-tier flashback that sets up Cliff\u2019s backstory; the jarring scene featuring Damian Lewis as a polyester version of Steve McQueen; the cheap shot at Bruce Lee. But, equally, there is much here that represents a film-maker at the top of his game. The delight he takes in the details that anchor the story in time and place: who else but Tarantino would include entire montages dedicated to vintage fonts? The heart-tugging music choices; the limber camerawork and tawny nostalgic warmth of Robert Richardson\u2019s cinematography; every last juicy frame set at the Manson family hideout at the Spahn Movie Ranch. It\u2019s a film that could only have been made by one man. Tarantino\u2019s fear of replacement, the subtext of some of the more uneven passages in the film, is, for the moment, unfounded.",

They may be matching us against police watchlists, maintaining their own watchlists or sharing their watchlists with the police, other companies and other governments. Our faces may even be used to train the machine-learning algorithms deployed by oppressive regimes such as China, which uses facial recognition technology <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/apr/11/china-hi-tech-war-on-muslim-minority-xinjiang-uighurs-surveillance-face-recognition\" title=\"\">to monitor and control its people</a>, particularly its Uighur Muslims, more than a million of whom are interned in concentration camps.</p> <p>Sounds far-fetched?

At its centre are a cluster of songs about a burned-out affair: a pair of forlorn country ballads in Falling and Sinner, and Depression, Descent, the devastated reflections of which are belied by its catchy, soft rock style. Stevens is strong on narrative: Teen Bride laments a young woman pregnant with \u201ca baby that would never live to see Missouri\u201d, while The Tillman Song honours a former NFL athlete killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan.

      "bodyText": "Raised in Missouri, Leslie Stevens has spent her professional life in Los Angeles fronting a country rock band. Much loved by LA\u2019s Americana crowd, and with a couple of decent albums to her name, she seemed perpetually on the verge of a breakout that never quite arrived. After a few years below the radar \u2013 motherhood will do that \u2013 Stevens has re-emerged with an album that should establish her credentials as a singer-songwriter of skill and passion. Not everyone will love her voice \u2013 effortlessly melodic, though with a pinch of Joanna Newsom-style squeakiness involved \u2013 but Sinner, burnished by producer Jonathan Wilson with strands of steel guitar and even Mellotron, packs a potent emotional punch. At its centre are a cluster of songs about a burned-out affair: a pair of forlorn country ballads in Falling and Sinner, and Depression, Descent, the devastated reflections of which are belied by its catchy, soft rock style. Stevens is strong on narrative: Teen Bride laments a young woman pregnant with \u201ca baby that would never live to see Missouri\u201d, while The Tillman Song honours a former NFL athlete killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan. For a self-styled purveyor of \u201ccosmic country\u201d, Stevens proves admirably grounded.",

But what do musicians make of this lively cinematic category?

I remember thinking: ah, OK, that\u2019s what to expect \u2013 driving around in great cars, hanging out with really famous singers and watching Elvis backstage. Sadly, touring for me is more about hanging out in a dressing room for hours and having cold rider food for dinner \u2013 not quite as glamorous. But this is a great film, and Joaquin Phoenix is really well cast as Cash \u2013 he\u2019s got this bad-guy thing about him and seems a bit dangerous. And the songs are timeless.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2yCIwmNuLE\" title=\"\">Amy</a><br><strong>(</strong><strong>Documentary; Asif Kapadia, 2015</strong><strong>)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4a899db5c03b3be712342bb0d7128f6bdf35c55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4a899db5c03b3be712342bb0d7128f6bdf35c55/0_406_7138_4281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young Amy Winehouse in Asif Kapadia\u2019s Amy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young Amy Winehouse in Asif Kapadia\u2019s Amy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar Picture Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such a devastating and beautiful film. It\u2019s interesting to see Amy Winehouse as a young girl with raw talent, and watch how, like a wave, she goes up and up and up and then crashes. As a viewer, you feel almost guilty to be watching her \u2013 she was watched enough \u2013 but this is a respectful portrait and I like that it celebrates her music. A lot of the time, in films about female artists, they only focus on the tragedy of their emotional lives and not enough about how amazing their craft was \u2013 and with this film you definitely get a sense of what an amazing singer and songwriter she was. She was much more than someone with addiction problems: she was a singular talent.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b8i3LCp0is\" title=\"\">Hedwig and the Angry Inch</a><br><strong>(</strong><strong>Drama; John Cameron Mitchell, 2001</strong><strong>)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4815e22a4e87b47d68162efb16c2dcf24165f21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4815e22a4e87b47d68162efb16c2dcf24165f21/0_126_6781_4070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Cameron Mitchell in Hedwig and the Angry Inch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Cameron Mitchell in Hedwig and the Angry Inch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TCD/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is about an East German singer who has a botched sex-change operation and is left with an \u201cangry inch\u201d of flesh between her legs. Moving to the US, she gets involved with another singer, who steals her songs and becomes famous, while Hedwig, played by the director John Cameron Mitchell, ends up playing in a chain of seafood restaurants called Bilgewater\u2019s. It\u2019s a beautiful film that touches on Greek mythology and the origins of love, as well as gender identity. It\u2019s a lot of fun too \u2013 a comedy with a serious message. And the songs are great.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJu9nfVCQmk\" title=\"\">The Doors</a><br><strong>(</strong><strong>Drama; Oliver Stone, 1991</strong><strong>)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc6a3a9cf06de02ca80a1d7135f050ccfc63b13b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc6a3a9cf06de02ca80a1d7135f050ccfc63b13b/989_0_4133_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle MacLachlan, Val Kilmer, Frank Whaley and Kevin Dillon in The Doors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyle MacLachlan, Val Kilmer, Frank Whaley and Kevin Dillon in The Doors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TCD/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I remember watching this, stoned, while at university, and I think you kind of have to be stoned to watch it, because it\u2019s so psychedelic and weird. I\u2019ve always had a fascination with Jim Morrison and regularly I ask myself: \u201cWhat would a female Jim Morrison do in this moment?\u201d, because I like his commitment to the moment as a performer, and his shameless expression of his sexuality, which, as a woman, I think is a nice thing to exploit. I don\u2019t know how I would feel watching this film now, not being stoned, but at the time it seemed like a really romantic portrayal of a poetic artist.</p> <h2>Whiplash<br><strong>(</strong><strong>Drama; Damien Chazelle, 2014</strong><strong>)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42cbd2b641c8cccab206ed8368292a43fba6a4e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42cbd2b641c8cccab206ed8368292a43fba6a4e5/0_51_5122_3075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Teller in Whiplash.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miles Teller in Whiplash.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is about what a music student who really wants to be great has to sacrifice to pursue greatness. It reminded me a little of my own experience at university, and how there\u2019s such a difference between studying music, which is quite sterile, and then actually going out and doing it. You have to unlearn everything and just try to be honest, using your instrument to speak in a way that people can understand.</p> <p>Andrew\u2019s (Miles Teller) relationship with his music teacher in the film is very extreme, but I had music teachers at school who I felt really passionate about and who I wanted to get better for, so they would believe in me.</p> <h2>Neil Tennant</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3574aedd5ed7d2b7755100db03c64d1d90b1ef55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3574aedd5ed7d2b7755100db03c64d1d90b1ef55/412_227_1322_1322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Tennant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Neil Tennant co-founded the synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys with Chris Lowe in London in 1981 and went on to sell more than 100m records worldwide, including the hits West End Girls and Always on My Mind.

And very new. It\u2019s the document of Bowie in America, and gets you so close. He\u2019s so vulnerable, sniffing \u2013 obviously taking cocaine \u2013 and looks like an alien; but when talking Alan Yentob through his old tour outfits, he\u2019s still something of a chirpy cockney lad.</p> <p>The film also shows the sharpness and originality of his musical mind, especially when he\u2019s directing his amazing backing singers through their parts.

I think of it as a glam-rock document, really: all those fantastic songs, confined to the stage, plus the brilliant makeup, in this frightening city. The notion of \u201cdivine decadence\u201d was very intriguing when you were an 18-year-old student from Newcastle, recently arrived in London. It also had an impact on punk \u2013 look at Siouxsie Sioux: obviously influenced by Liza Minnelli. My friends and I would listen to the soundtrack in our Tottenham student flat, back-to-back with Lou Reed\u2019s <em>Transformer</em> and Roxy Music\u2019s second album.

He reads that the composer Delius, also from Yorkshire, is now blind, partly paralysed and can no longer compose, with work left unfinished. Fenby manages to help him deliver those last works. </p> <p>It\u2019s an elegiac film about the painful process of creating music and the end of a creative life. It\u2019s very emotional, unsettling and moving. Delius is an incredibly tragic figure, both fragile and brutal.

Then it becomes a film about what the pop industry can do to people, what not to do within it, and about messiah complexes. It\u2019s a really over-the-top, sinister film \u2013 it becomes almost alien. But it also reminds you to keep your ego in check, pull your baseball cap down, don\u2019t get lost in the madness, and just keep working.</p> <h2>Wayne Coyne</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5f8240206ed9e2fb97f79e9575fdf69bd30a9f0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f8240206ed9e2fb97f79e9575fdf69bd30a9f0f/58_0_2005_2005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wayne Coyne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wayne Coyne is the lead singer of the Flaming Lips, which he founded in 1983.

In 2005 he appeared in a documentary about the Flaming Lips called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVze1Gz__Vk\" title=\"\"><em>The Fearless Freaks</em></a>, and three years later released his own sci-fi feature film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5_AJ8WTDAY\" title=\"\"><em>Christmas on Mars</em></a>.

We\u2019d see anything in Oklahoma City to pass the time, and we were the only kids in the theatre, smoking a joint. Then the second film came on.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t known this period of Pink Floyd. It opened up a new world of music to me.</p> <p>I was 16, wanting to be a rock star, and they actually talked about how they made their songs. I went out and bought a Stratocaster like Dave Gilmour\u2019s soon after.

Now I can watch it online anywhere within seconds. It\u2019s better than you think. It shows just how insane their lives were while they were making some of their best music, in hotel rooms doing drugs, with all this weird shit going on.

I saw it late, expecting to just watch this bunch of weird hippies rolling around and Jimi Hendrix popping up at the end. But the performances were great: this turned me on to the Who, Joan Baez, Joe Cocker. The editing was so ahead of its time, so dynamic. <em>Woodstock</em> really made people realise that music isn\u2019t just about hearing it: it\u2019s about seeing it, and getting more of the personalities behind it. About getting more of everything.</p> <h2>The Kids Are Alright</h2> <p><strong>(Documentary; Jeff Stein, 1979)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71f867fc523a5b4912b55364dd054e22d9549108\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71f867fc523a5b4912b55364dd054e22d9549108/38_1089_1253_751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Who, left to right: Keith Moon, Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Who, left to right: Keith Moon, Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than any other band, the Who put that thing in me that made me who I am now, and this documentary told their story in a way that really zapped me. That connection you see between Pete Townshend and Keith Moon: you rarely see people get so possessed by their music, their energy and connection to each other. Then there\u2019s Roger Daltrey being this flawless singer, an angel, in the chaos of it all.</p> <p>This documentary shows how much of the band\u2019s exuberance is in their music, and when we\u2019re watching their performances being constructed, I don\u2019t see them being fakes \u2013 I see them making art out of their imaginations.</p> <h2>Urgh!

One song each, blam-blam-blam. You didn\u2019t know who was American and who was English and it didn\u2019t matter \u2013 what did was every band was doing it themselves and looking bizarre.</p> <p>And in a world where you knew you could never be the Beatles, here was John Cooper Clarke performing to 50 people and being fantastic. That felt huge. Seeing the energy coming off the audience when he made that effort really did something to me.</p> <h2>Nitin Sawhney</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ecb1896baebcbfa15e4d1e35c4ea341d11849d04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecb1896baebcbfa15e4d1e35c4ea341d11849d04/158_737_1251_1251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nitin Sawhney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A musician and composer, Nitin Sawhney was born in London in 1964 and raised in Kent by parents who had emigrated from Punjab.

You\u2019re shown a young man trying to balance life in music and his illness with a domestic existence, and the performances of Sam Riley as Curtis and Samantha Morton as his wife, Deborah, are very powerful.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t a huge Joy Division fan when they were around \u2013 I was studying nearby in Liverpool \u2013 but this film absolutely captures the mood of that time, as does the black-and-white cinematography. It also nails that struggle of being an artist and a human being.

The director is Romany himself, and there\u2019s no narrator, so the story is told through song and subtitles with no contrivance at all. You feel properly immersed in new worlds as a result \u2013 I play flamenco, and you feel the echoes of ancient traditions in it, but this is something else. The most powerful scene is of three women singing on a hilltop about how they\u2019ve been disenfranchised.

His real story then reveals itself to be very different.</p> <p>This film delves into mythology, how it develops, and the way we elevate musicians as beacons in culture. It\u2019s also a film about an incredibly underrated guy, and how difficult it was to find lost stars before the internet took off.

Parker was 34 when he died, but the coroner thought he was 60, looking at his body. By getting into the New York club scene and looking at aspects of racism, this film also shows just how much Parker achieved, given everything he was fighting against.<br></p> <h2>Anna Meredith</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9b1c6e7b92a2806a4fe9d96797ec9e23ab80da3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b1c6e7b92a2806a4fe9d96797ec9e23ab80da3e/72_0_1473_1472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Meredith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Anna Meredith was born in London in 1978 and grew up outside Edinburgh.

      "bodyText": "Movies about musicians, whether biopics, fictions or documentaries, are a fixture in cinema, but judging by the flurry of activity over the past 12 months \u2013 with acclaimed films about Aretha Franklin, Freddie Mercury and Elton John among others \u2013 we are in an uncommonly busy period, if not a flat-out golden age. Good news for music fans, but even better news for the music industry, where these films represent an increasingly vital revenue stream in an era of slumped record sales, bumping a band\u2019s back catalogue and getting a new generation hooked on their work. There is, of course, far more to these movies than money-spinning: a good biopic or documentary can bring the songs to life, and illuminate the struggles of their creators. But what do musicians make of this lively cinematic category? We asked six eminent songwriters \u2013 including a few who have scored movies, and others who have been the subject of movies \u2013 to each pick their five favourite music films. Anna Calvi Born in 1980 to an English mother and Italian father, Anna Calvi grew up in Twickenham and studied music at Southampton University, specialising in violin and guitar. Her eponymous debut album, released in 2011, was nominated for a Mercury prize, as were her 2013 follow-up, One Breath, and her latest album, Hunter: \u201cA serious-minded collection of pop songs about desire\u2026 [that] recalls the films of Douglas Sirk,\u201d said the Guardian in a five-star review. Calvi recorded a track for the 2015 sci-fi movie Insurgent and has scored the new season of Peaky Blinders. Walk the Line (Drama; James Mangold, 2005) I watched this film about Johnny Cash\u2019s early life and career before I was signed, and it gave me my first taste of what touring might be like. I remember thinking: ah, OK, that\u2019s what to expect \u2013 driving around in great cars, hanging out with really famous singers and watching Elvis backstage. Sadly, touring for me is more about hanging out in a dressing room for hours and having cold rider food for dinner \u2013 not quite as glamorous. But this is a great film, and Joaquin Phoenix is really well cast as Cash \u2013 he\u2019s got this bad-guy thing about him and seems a bit dangerous. And the songs are timeless. Amy (Documentary; Asif Kapadia, 2015) Such a devastating and beautiful film. It\u2019s interesting to see Amy Winehouse as a young girl with raw talent, and watch how, like a wave, she goes up and up and up and then crashes. As a viewer, you feel almost guilty to be watching her \u2013 she was watched enough \u2013 but this is a respectful portrait and I like that it celebrates her music. A lot of the time, in films about female artists, they only focus on the tragedy of their emotional lives and not enough about how amazing their craft was \u2013 and with this film you definitely get a sense of what an amazing singer and songwriter she was. She was much more than someone with addiction problems: she was a singular talent. Hedwig and the Angry Inch (Drama; John Cameron Mitchell, 2001) This is about an East German singer who has a botched sex-change operation and is left with an \u201cangry inch\u201d of flesh between her legs. Moving to the US, she gets involved with another singer, who steals her songs and becomes famous, while Hedwig, played by the director John Cameron Mitchell, ends up playing in a chain of seafood restaurants called Bilgewater\u2019s. It\u2019s a beautiful film that touches on Greek mythology and the origins of love, as well as gender identity. It\u2019s a lot of fun too \u2013 a comedy with a serious message. And the songs are great. The Doors (Drama; Oliver Stone, 1991) I remember watching this, stoned, while at university, and I think you kind of have to be stoned to watch it, because it\u2019s so psychedelic and weird. I\u2019ve always had a fascination with Jim Morrison and regularly I ask myself: \u201cWhat would a female Jim Morrison do in this moment?\u201d, because I like his commitment to the moment as a performer, and his shameless expression of his sexuality, which, as a woman, I think is a nice thing to exploit. I don\u2019t know how I would feel watching this film now, not being stoned, but at the time it seemed like a really romantic portrayal of a poetic artist. Whiplash (Drama; Damien Chazelle, 2014) This is about what a music student who really wants to be great has to sacrifice to pursue greatness. It reminded me a little of my own experience at university, and how there\u2019s such a difference between studying music, which is quite sterile, and then actually going out and doing it. You have to unlearn everything and just try to be honest, using your instrument to speak in a way that people can understand. Andrew\u2019s (Miles Teller) relationship with his music teacher in the film is very extreme, but I had music teachers at school who I felt really passionate about and who I wanted to get better for, so they would believe in me. Neil Tennant Neil Tennant co-founded the synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys with Chris Lowe in London in 1981 and went on to sell more than 100m records worldwide, including the hits West End Girls and Always on My Mind. The duo have released 13 studio albums, with videos directed by Derek Jarman, Bruce Weber, Wolfgang Tillmans and Martin Parr. Their latest EP, Agenda, came out in February. They headline Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park on 15 September. The Young Ones (Drama; Sidney J Furie, 1961) A group of teenagers, led by Cliff Richard, rally together to stop a theatre being demolished. They succeed by putting on a show there. The Young Ones is a gorgeous fantasy, so optimistic and beautiful, about the potential of pop music for young people. It made me want to join a youth theatre, which I did a few years later, and it introduced the six-year-old me to the thrill of both pop music and theatre. They\u2019re still thrilling me today. Cracked Actor (Documentary; Alan Yentob, 1975) As a huge David Bowie fan who was at the last Ziggy Stardust gig \u2013 when he said he was quitting, I remember turning round to my friend and saying, \u201cAs if!\u201d \u2013 this BBC documentary from a couple of years later felt very special. And very new. It\u2019s the document of Bowie in America, and gets you so close. He\u2019s so vulnerable, sniffing \u2013 obviously taking cocaine \u2013 and looks like an alien; but when talking Alan Yentob through his old tour outfits, he\u2019s still something of a chirpy cockney lad. The film also shows the sharpness and originality of his musical mind, especially when he\u2019s directing his amazing backing singers through their parts. It\u2019s fascinating to see him at work as a musician. Cabaret (Drama; Bob Fosse, 1972) The story of singer Sally Bowles in the Weimar Republic, which came out late in 1972, into a very dreary Britain. I think of it as a glam-rock document, really: all those fantastic songs, confined to the stage, plus the brilliant makeup, in this frightening city. The notion of \u201cdivine decadence\u201d was very intriguing when you were an 18-year-old student from Newcastle, recently arrived in London. It also had an impact on punk \u2013 look at Siouxsie Sioux: obviously influenced by Liza Minnelli. My friends and I would listen to the soundtrack in our Tottenham student flat, back-to-back with Lou Reed\u2019s Transformer and Roxy Music\u2019s second album. It had the same impact. Song of Summer (Drama; Ken Russell, 1968) This was a BBC Omnibus drama about a young composer from Yorkshire, Eric Fenby, in the late 1920s. He reads that the composer Delius, also from Yorkshire, is now blind, partly paralysed and can no longer compose, with work left unfinished. Fenby manages to help him deliver those last works. It\u2019s an elegiac film about the painful process of creating music and the end of a creative life. It\u2019s very emotional, unsettling and moving. Delius is an incredibly tragic figure, both fragile and brutal. Russell was brilliant at creating images to accompany music. The Wrecking Crew! (Documentary; Denny Tedesco, 2008) A film about this extraordinary, charming, unegotistical group of LA session musicians in the 60s and early 70s who played on everything, and didn\u2019t publicly get proper credit. They made Phil Spector\u2019s Wall of Sound, they played the backing tracks for the Beach Boys, they\u2019re on Nancy Sinatra\u2019s These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 and Glenn Campbell\u2019s Wichita Lineman (with Carol Kaye\u2019s bassline). You realise all these records have a sound, and the sound is this band. I wanted us to go to LA to make an album [2012\u2019s Elysium] and record in Capitol Studios because of this film. It\u2019s one of the best films I\u2019ve ever seen about the process of making pop music. Nadine Shah Born in South Tyneside to a Pakistani father and an English mother of Norwegian heritage, Nadine Shah has recorded three albums over the past six years, including Love Your Dum and Mad (2013) and Holiday Destination, which was nominated for a Mercury prize in 2018. The 33-year-old is currently recording a new album and plays the Legitimate Peaky Blinders festival in Digbeth, Birmingham on 14 September. 20,000 Days on Earth (Documentary; Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, 2014) When you\u2019ve got a favourite artist, you want to know everything about them, from their favourite colour to what they have for breakfast, and you get that with this Nick Cave documentary. It\u2019s clear how every detail has been carefully and thoughtfully curated by him. I love the glimpse into the friendship between him and Warren Ellis when they\u2019re discussing the time they met Nina Simone, and she said what she wanted to have after her gig: \u201cI want champagne, cocaine and sausages!\u201d They look like little boys when telling the story. It\u2019s a beautiful insight into their world outside of music-making. What Happened, Miss Simone? (Documentary; Liz Garbus, 2015) A really definitive film about an incredible woman. She\u2019s mint \u2013 the end! But seriously: I\u2019m obsessed with the model Nina Simone set out for women. She allowed us to sing in lower, stranger registers. She made politics a central part of her art. She was uncompromising. The way her daughter leads her story in this film also gives it a really special perspective. You can\u2019t help but feel humble before her. Little Voice (Drama; Mark Herman, 1998) A film that absolutely nails the experience of really wanting to perform \u2013 that feeling that you\u2019re weird to do so when you\u2019re not being encouraged \u2013 and of music being a brilliant form of escape. Even though I\u2019m not working-class, the story described a world and an attitude to women I knew well. It\u2019s also about finding your identity through music, how you can find your own voice through singing other people\u2019s songs. I used to do that myself as a child, trying to become Tina Turner by singing Private Dancer! Scott Walker: 30 Century Man (Documentary; Stephen Kijak, 2006) Years ago, I went to see this documentary with a friend, not knowing who Scott Walker was. When I came out of the cinema he was my new favourite artist. I\u2019m absolutely not kidding! It was made at the time he made [2006 album] The Drift, and it sets out how he moved his career away from his early years, on his own terms. If you haven\u2019t seen it, I swear you\u2019ll be wanting to punch a piece of meat for percussion, as he does on Clara, by the end of it. It\u2019s that good. Vox Lux (Drama; Brady Corbet, 2018) Natalie Portman plays a young teenage pop artist, Celeste, who starts making music after surviving a school shooting. Then it becomes a film about what the pop industry can do to people, what not to do within it, and about messiah complexes. It\u2019s a really over-the-top, sinister film \u2013 it becomes almost alien. But it also reminds you to keep your ego in check, pull your baseball cap down, don\u2019t get lost in the madness, and just keep working. Wayne Coyne Wayne Coyne is the lead singer of the Flaming Lips, which he founded in 1983. The band has released 15 studio albums, including At War With the Mystics, which won two Grammy awards in 2006. In 2005 he appeared in a documentary about the Flaming Lips called The Fearless Freaks, and three years later released his own sci-fi feature film, Christmas on Mars. Born in Pittsburgh in 1961, Coyne grew up in Oklahoma City, where he now lives with his wife and baby son. Pink Floyd: Live At Pompeii (Documentary; Adrian Maben, 1972) This film changed my life. I wouldn\u2019t have known it existed if I hadn\u2019t gone to see a terrible Don Johnson movie, A Boy and His Dog, in a double bill with my brother. We\u2019d see anything in Oklahoma City to pass the time, and we were the only kids in the theatre, smoking a joint. Then the second film came on. I hadn\u2019t known this period of Pink Floyd. It opened up a new world of music to me. I was 16, wanting to be a rock star, and they actually talked about how they made their songs. I went out and bought a Stratocaster like Dave Gilmour\u2019s soon after. I still can\u2019t believe I had the luck to see it. Cocksucker Blues (Documentary; Robert Frank, 1972) This unreleased Rolling Stones documentary was a film you\u2019d always hear about but know you\u2019d never, ever see. Now I can watch it online anywhere within seconds. It\u2019s better than you think. It shows just how insane their lives were while they were making some of their best music, in hotel rooms doing drugs, with all this weird shit going on. People who see them in stadiums now wouldn\u2019t relate to those characters, but this proves they were always phenomenal, even in their craziest hours. Woodstock (Documentary; Michael Wadleigh, 1970) By contrast, everyone had seen Woodstock: this movie played and played. I saw it late, expecting to just watch this bunch of weird hippies rolling around and Jimi Hendrix popping up at the end. But the performances were great: this turned me on to the Who, Joan Baez, Joe Cocker. The editing was so ahead of its time, so dynamic. Woodstock really made people realise that music isn\u2019t just about hearing it: it\u2019s about seeing it, and getting more of the personalities behind it. About getting more of everything. The Kids Are Alright (Documentary; Jeff Stein, 1979) More than any other band, the Who put that thing in me that made me who I am now, and this documentary told their story in a way that really zapped me. That connection you see between Pete Townshend and Keith Moon: you rarely see people get so possessed by their music, their energy and connection to each other. Then there\u2019s Roger Daltrey being this flawless singer, an angel, in the chaos of it all. This documentary shows how much of the band\u2019s exuberance is in their music, and when we\u2019re watching their performances being constructed, I don\u2019t see them being fakes \u2013 I see them making art out of their imaginations. Urgh! A Music War (Live music compilation; Derek Burbidge, 1982) Oklahoma City was a test city for MTV, and this compilation of US and UK punk rock bands \u2013 XTC, the Cramps, the Dead Kennedys \u2013 came out around the time, and had that same spirit. One song each, blam-blam-blam. You didn\u2019t know who was American and who was English and it didn\u2019t matter \u2013 what did was every band was doing it themselves and looking bizarre. And in a world where you knew you could never be the Beatles, here was John Cooper Clarke performing to 50 people and being fantastic. That felt huge. Seeing the energy coming off the audience when he made that effort really did something to me. Nitin Sawhney A musician and composer, Nitin Sawhney was born in London in 1964 and raised in Kent by parents who had emigrated from Punjab. He started as a comedy writer, working with Sanjeev Bhaskar on a sketch show that would eventually become Goodness Gracious Me. He has released 11 solo albums, including 1999 breakthrough Beyond Skin, and collaborated with Paul McCartney, Akram Khan and the London Symphony Orchestra. Sawhney has scored TV programmes, computer games and more than 50 films, including Mira Nair\u2019s The Namesake (2006). Control (Drama; Anton Corbijn, 2007) An incredibly bold portrait of Ian Curtis\u2019s life, which manages to take his story away from mythology really convincingly. You\u2019re shown a young man trying to balance life in music and his illness with a domestic existence, and the performances of Sam Riley as Curtis and Samantha Morton as his wife, Deborah, are very powerful. I wasn\u2019t a huge Joy Division fan when they were around \u2013 I was studying nearby in Liverpool \u2013 but this film absolutely captures the mood of that time, as does the black-and-white cinematography. It also nails that struggle of being an artist and a human being. That isn\u2019t captured enough. Latcho Drom (Documentary; 1993, Tony Gatlif) This film traces the evolution of flamenco, from its origins in India through Egypt, through eastern Europe to the west \u2013 \u201clatcho drom\u201d means safe journey. The director is Romany himself, and there\u2019s no narrator, so the story is told through song and subtitles with no contrivance at all. You feel properly immersed in new worlds as a result \u2013 I play flamenco, and you feel the echoes of ancient traditions in it, but this is something else. The most powerful scene is of three women singing on a hilltop about how they\u2019ve been disenfranchised. It\u2019s unbelievably moving. Searching for Sugar Man (Documentary; Malik Bendjelloul, 2012) A superb documentary about the once little-known American singer-songwriter Sixto Rodriguez, and his huge popularity in South Africa, which starts with a rumour about him killing himself by setting fire to himself on stage. His real story then reveals itself to be very different. This film delves into mythology, how it develops, and the way we elevate musicians as beacons in culture. It\u2019s also a film about an incredibly underrated guy, and how difficult it was to find lost stars before the internet took off. It couldn\u2019t happen now. This Is Spinal Tap (Comedy; Rob Reiner, 1984) I\u2019ve played in heavy rock bands, funk bands, jazz bands, and this film captures the hilarious madness of touring life: the egos of musicians and managers, the pedantry behind getting the right things on riders, the bathos behind big epic concerts\u2026 I got lost in a labyrinth of corridors before getting to the stage once, just like Spinal Tap! This remains a tour bus favourite because of the attention to detail, particularly in the actors\u2019 performances. I couldn\u2019t believe it when I realised that Michael McKean from Better Call Saul was the guy who played David St Hubbins. But of course he was. He was always that good. Bird (Drama; Clint Eastwood, 1988) A beautiful film about Charlie Parker, played brilliantly by Forest Whitaker, and directed by an actor who\u2019s obviously a big jazz fan. Bird really shows you how ludicrously gifted Parker was, how his mind worked on a completely different level, but also how much he got lost in self-loathing, and how addiction made everything fall apart. Parker was 34 when he died, but the coroner thought he was 60, looking at his body. By getting into the New York club scene and looking at aspects of racism, this film also shows just how much Parker achieved, given everything he was fighting against. Anna Meredith Anna Meredith was born in London in 1978 and grew up outside Edinburgh. She studied music at York University and the Royal College of Music and spent several years as composer in residence with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Her debut album, Varmints, won the Scottish album of the year award in 2016. Last year she recorded the soundtrack for Eighth Grade, and her music was used in the films Dheepan (2015) and The Favourite (2018). Meredith\u2019s new album, Fibs, will be released on 25 October. Homecoming: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9 (Documentary; Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter and Ed Burke, 2019) Homecoming tells the story behind Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2018 Coachella show, which makes a huge statement about the importance of African American education and the college experience. It cuts through the idea of pop stars just arriving into culture, being presented to the world as if they\u2019re just naturally talented and what they do is absolutely no effort. Beyonc\u00e9 works so hard! She\u2019s on top of every detail \u2013 the choreography, the costumes, the lighting, the staging \u2013 and it\u2019s so great seeing a woman so much in charge of her ideas. It makes you want to work harder. The Making of West Side Story (Documentary; Christopher Swann, 1985) This documentary is about the Leonard Bernstein-conducted recording of the score in the 80s, with Kiri Te Kanawa and Jos\u00e9 Carreras. That soundtrack was a staple at home when I was growing up \u2013 we had this glossy, massive four-cassette tape box of it. Bernstein is such an interesting person: temperamental, feisty, impatient, funny, smoking cigarettes in his red polo neck. And to see him conduct his music \u2013 this incredible, ambitious, interesting, crazy, heartbreaking music, which is never schmaltzy, but crunchy and angsty, and then with these moments of release \u2013 is really amazing. George Michael: Freedom (Documentary; David Austin &amp; George Michael, 2017) This was made before George died and released shortly after, so you can\u2019t watch it without a lump in your throat. He\u2019s such a brilliant musician, an effortless singer, but also just an ordinary, interesting guy with a natural gift. I used to have this unhealthy habit of playing his songs when I was drunk and maudlin. I love how this film shows how he took control of his image early on, and how we see the lyrics to Freedom as being so astute, not vacuous at all. He\u2019s also funny and filthy \u2013 the kind of person you\u2019d love to have a drink with. It\u2019s so sad that he\u2019s not here. A Mighty Wind (Comedy; Christopher Guest, 2003) A great mockumentary about a reunion of three folk bands that\u2019s gently observed but also spot-on. I love how it quietly gets behind the scenes into the backbiting and the jealousy that leads up to their reunion concert, and I especially love the attitudes towards the shiny sellouts. The characters are so well done, too \u2013 the troubled former couple, the old-school trio, the Folksmen \u2013 but not every moment is mined for gags, which is what makes it work. You can tell everyone taking part genuinely loves music, and that\u2019s why Christopher Guest always gets it right. Queen: Days of Our Lives (Documentary; Matt O\u2019Casey, 2011) I was a teenager when I got into Queen \u2013 Bohemian Rhapsody was everywhere after it was on Wayne\u2019s World. There\u2019s so much joy in their music, a real not-giving-a shit-ness. It\u2019s great to see them in this documentary being these normal, geeky people. You see all the mundanity that goes on behind the scenes of Freddie\u2019s showmanship on stage, plus there\u2019s the unexpectedness of hearing his gentle English accent. Then you hear him live, and see the sweat in his moustache, and it\u2019s spine-tingling.",

      "body": "<p>After beating four other publishing houses in an auction, William Heinemann was in no doubt that <em>The Changing of the Guard</em> would more than reward the five-figure advance it paid to its author, Simon Akam.</p> <p>The publisher boasted that the 182,000-word book examining the evolution of the British Army after 9/11 would be \u201can explosive, intimate authoritative account \u2026 based on exclusive interviews, rigorous research and on-the-ground reporting\u201d.</p> <p>Akam seemed the perfect writer for the job.

      "bodyText": "After beating four other publishing houses in an auction, William Heinemann was in no doubt that The Changing of the Guard would more than reward the five-figure advance it paid to its author, Simon Akam. The publisher boasted that the 182,000-word book examining the evolution of the British Army after 9/11 would be \u201can explosive, intimate authoritative account \u2026 based on exclusive interviews, rigorous research and on-the-ground reporting\u201d. Akam seemed the perfect writer for the job. He had spent a gap year with the army as a teenager and was a promising journalist \u2013 he had studied at Columbia Journalism School in New York on a Fulbright scholarship and has written for Reuters, the New York Times, the Economist and Newsweek, among others. But six months on from its scheduled publication, The Changing of the Guard is now a ghost book. References to it can be found via Google but it has not been published, due to an extraordinary legal row that has sucked in SAS veteran Andy McNab, the Ministry of Defence, a prestigious war-studies centre and a number of anti-censorship organisations. In the three years Akam spent writing and researching the book he interviewed 260 people, in a bid to understand how the army had changed over the last couple of decades, and in particular what it had learned from two recent conflicts. \u201cI wanted to know what had become of the army I briefly knew as an 18-year-old,\u201d he explained. \u201cI knew that Iraq and Afghanistan had gone badly. As I worked, I found that there had been no real high-level accountability internally within the military for the failure of these campaigns.\u201d But the research was to prove a formidable challenge. \u201cTo write narrative prose about events I had not witnessed and which took place up to 18 years ago, it was necessary to cross-reference multiple accounts that were often contradictory and which, given the unfavourable outcomes of the wars that form the subject of the book, often consisted of a mutual exercise in sources blaming each other,\u201d Akam said. When he returned to sources who had been interviewed on the record, some revoked their consent and others changed position. \u201cThis is a common occurrence in this kind of reporting,\u201d Akam said. \u201cCommon enough that it has a name \u2013 source remorse.\u201d Penguin Random House (PRH), owner of William Heinemann, told Akam that there was a \u201cquite unprecedented level of withdrawal of support and co-operation for the book from multiple sources\u201d and halted the March publication. The move prompted eight organisations, including the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom (ECPMF), Reporters Without Borders, Index on Censorship and the National Union of Journalists, to accuse it of \u201ccensoring information of vital interest to the public\u201d. In a letter to PRH, sent in May and now shared with the Observer, the organisations claim that William Heinemann executives told Akam\u2019s literary agent that they \u201cwould only publish the book if Akam gave full copy approval to everyone mentioned in it, with every named individual signing off in writing what was said about them, and additionally demanded the submission of the manuscript to the British Ministry of Defence and for Akam to take on board any MoD amendments.\u201d The publisher\u2019s lawyers justified their position by invoking data protection and privacy laws. The ECPMF said it was \u201chighly concerned about the precedent such action establishes\u201d. Akam himself was left aghast at PRH\u2019s proposals. \u201cIt is the equivalent of asking an author writing about Goldman Sachs to submit the text to the investment bank for their edits,\u201d he said. PRH said: \u201cAs we made clear in our response of May 2019 to the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom, this is a decision we were obliged to take as a responsible publisher and we do not see this as a freedom of expression issue. Among other reasons, it was our view that the author\u2019s due diligence did not meet the standards of balance and accuracy expected of responsible publishers, authors and journalists.

In an email sent to PRH in January, the centre\u2019s director, Dr Robert Johnson, said he had been contacted by \u201cnumerous\u201d individuals approached for the book, including two retired generals and a serving colonel, who were unhappy with what Akam had written, believing it to be \u201cunjust\u201d and \u201cuntruthful\u201d. Johnson warned PRH that it would be sued if publication of Akam\u2019s book went ahead. Akam, who insists the individuals\u2019 views were clearly represented in the text and that none had threatened to sue, believes it was Johnson\u2019s intervention that led to PRH demanding he submit his manuscript to the MoD for review. Johnson, whose biography states that he \u201cadvises and delivers direct support to government and armed forces in defence and security matters\u201d, told the Observer: \u201cA number of people have given their time and energy to support Mr Akam, including military personnel offering personal disclosures, but it seems he had betrayed people\u2019s trust in order to write a piece of work which he feels is a devastating expos\u00e9 of his subjects. There is a difference between investigative journalism and creating a story at someone\u2019s expense for one\u2019s own promotion.\u201d Andy McNab, the former SAS soldier who has written two highly successful memoirs and a series of novels, and his literary agent Mark Lucas, both interviewed by Akam, also raised concerns. A chapter of The Changing of the Guard explores how McNab\u2019s books \u2013 which are published by another PRH imprint \u2013 had encouraged young men to join the army. McNab\u2019s most famous book, Bravo Two Zero, about an SAS unit deployed in Iraq in the first Gulf war, has been accused of fabrication, a charge he rejects, but something Akam wanted to explore in print. \u201cDuring fact-checking I went back to check details with both McNab and Lucas,\u201d said Akam, who alleges that after Lucas responded \u201cangrily\u201d to what he had written, PRH requested that he send the two men draft texts so that they could comment on its factual accuracy. Lucas told the Observer that he was far from angry, but admitted to feeling disappointed with the approach Akam had taken.

At the most recent, the friends sat round in a circle and shared food. At the beginning of the ceremony, everyone introduced themselves by giving their mother\u2019s and grandmothers\u2019 names and wished their friend a calm and peaceful birth. Then they read a poem and painted her arms. \u201cWe were going to massage her feet in oil but she didn\u2019t want that,\u201d said Green. \u201cShe said she\u2019d got a rash.\u201d</p> <p>One explanation for the trend is that families want to acknowledge life transitions such as births, marriages and deaths, but with a personal twist. \u201cFrom wedding vows that couples write for each other to eco-funerals, it\u2019s about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/02/give-up-faith-grieve-community-secular\" title=\"\">stepping away from religion</a>, but still signifying certain values to others, such as, \u2018we are eco, we are spiritual and we are original\u2019,\u201d said Charlotte Faircloth, a sociology lecturer at University College London.</p> <p>Social media platforms have also helped to spread the word. With flower crowns, painted bumps and floaty dresses, the ceremonies photograph well: there are tens of thousands of pictures posted under #motherblessing on Instagram. Some even hire professional photographers to document the occasion.</p> <p>Despite the avowed intentions of some young mothers to eschew commercialised baby showers, experts say that businesses are cashing in on the new trend. Doulas charge around \u00a3250 to perform the ceremonies and some involve costly flower displays and other expensive decorations.</p> <p>But Caroline Gatrell of Liverpool University Management School says high expenditure is not necessary. \u201cSome remain simple in form, with attendees contributing food and, where possible, flowers from their gardens. The point of the blessing is a chance for close friends and family to shower the mum with good wishes. It does not need a doula to organise this,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Jen Harvie, professor of contemporary theatre and performance at Queen Mary University of London, thinks participants need to be careful when replicating traditionally spiritual ceremonies. \u201cThere is a lack of understanding, and it is cultural appropriation,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the one hand, there is this fantasy of decommercialising the baby shower but, on the other, [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/18/native-americans-cultural-misappropriation\" title=\"\">Navajo culture</a>] is being commercialised in a different way.\u201d</p> <p>Her advice is to imagine your own ceremony, based on your own values. \u201cUse things from your own cultural background,\u201d she said. \u201cJust think about that.\u201d</p>",

Then they read a poem and painted her arms. \u201cWe were going to massage her feet in oil but she didn\u2019t want that,\u201d said Green. \u201cShe said she\u2019d got a rash.\u201d One explanation for the trend is that families want to acknowledge life transitions such as births, marriages and deaths, but with a personal twist. \u201cFrom wedding vows that couples write for each other to eco-funerals, it\u2019s about stepping away from religion, but still signifying certain values to others, such as, \u2018we are eco, we are spiritual and we are original\u2019,\u201d said Charlotte Faircloth, a sociology lecturer at University College London. Social media platforms have also helped to spread the word. With flower crowns, painted bumps and floaty dresses, the ceremonies photograph well: there are tens of thousands of pictures posted under #motherblessing on Instagram. Some even hire professional photographers to document the occasion. Despite the avowed intentions of some young mothers to eschew commercialised baby showers, experts say that businesses are cashing in on the new trend. Doulas charge around \u00a3250 to perform the ceremonies and some involve costly flower displays and other expensive decorations. But Caroline Gatrell of Liverpool University Management School says high expenditure is not necessary. \u201cSome remain simple in form, with attendees contributing food and, where possible, flowers from their gardens. The point of the blessing is a chance for close friends and family to shower the mum with good wishes. It does not need a doula to organise this,\u201d she said. Jen Harvie, professor of contemporary theatre and performance at Queen Mary University of London, thinks participants need to be careful when replicating traditionally spiritual ceremonies. \u201cThere is a lack of understanding, and it is cultural appropriation,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the one hand, there is this fantasy of decommercialising the baby shower but, on the other, [Navajo culture] is being commercialised in a different way.\u201d Her advice is to imagine your own ceremony, based on your own values. \u201cUse things from your own cultural background,\u201d she said. \u201cJust think about that.\u201d",

Until the corniche road was built in the 19th century, it was effectively cut off from the rest of Corsica; the entire peninsula is still carpeted in maquis, the fragrant, dense scrub that, over the centuries, has been a hiding place for rebels as Corsica endured waves of invasion and control, from Greeks and Romans, Pisans and Genoese and, eventually, the French (even the British at the end of the 18th century).</p> <p>Today, it remains appealingly wild and remote: look back along the coast and apart from the odd village clinging to the hills on the jagged western side, or tiny harbours nestled into the more rolling east, it could be the island from Jurassic World.

      "bodyText": "\u2018It\u2019s like being in a car advert!\u201d The corniche road along the western side of Cap Corse, the spiny promontory pointing north from the body of Corsica towards Genoa, must be one of Europe\u2019s most dramatic drives. Cliff-hugging hairpin bends hurtle around rocky outcrops and across densely forested hillsides, with the sea seeming both unnervingly close and dizzyingly far below. The kids leaned with glee one way and I leaned the other; taxis casually overtook us; at one point a wild boar (or possibly tame pig) wandered into view round a bend, and at another metal struts and wooden planks carried the road over a landslide. At just 40km long and 15km across, Cap Corse is like a miniature version of the island itself, with sandy beaches and impressive peaks in close, if terrifying, proximity. Until the corniche road was built in the 19th century, it was effectively cut off from the rest of Corsica; the entire peninsula is still carpeted in maquis, the fragrant, dense scrub that, over the centuries, has been a hiding place for rebels as Corsica endured waves of invasion and control, from Greeks and Romans, Pisans and Genoese and, eventually, the French (even the British at the end of the 18th century).

      "body": "<p>\u201cAll human life is there\u201d used to be the proudest boast of the (mercifully) defunct <em>News of the World</em>. Like everything else in that organ, it wasn\u2019t true: the <em>NoW</em> specialised in randy vicars, chorus girls, Tory spankers, pools winners, C-list celebrities and other minority sports. But there is a medium to which the slogan definitely applies \u2013 it\u2019s called the internet.</p> <p>The best metaphor for the net is to think of it as a mirror held up to human nature. All human life really is there. There\u2019s no ideology, fetish, behaviour, obsession, perversion, eccentricity or fad that doesn\u2019t find expression somewhere online. And while much of what we see reflected back to us is uplifting, banal, intriguing, harmless or fascinating, some of it is truly awful, for the simple reason that human nature is not only infinitely diverse but also sometimes unspeakably cruel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A key question is whether the moderation task is ultimately a futile, sisyphean one</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the early days of the internet and, later, the web, this didn\u2019t matter so much. But once cyberspace was captured by a few giant platforms, particularly Google, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, then it became problematic. The business models of these platforms depended on encouraging people to upload content to them in digital torrents. \u201cBroadcast yourself\u201d, remember, <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2010/03/broadcast-yourself.html\" title=\"\">was once the motto</a> of YouTube.</p> <p>And people did \u2013 as they slit the throats of hostages in the deserts of Arabia, raped three-year-old girls, shot an old man in the street, firebombed the villages of ethnic minorities or hanged themselves on camera\u2026</p> <p>All of which posed a problem for the social media brands, which liked to present themselves as facilitators of creativity, connectivity and good clean fun, an image threatened by the tide of crud that was coming at them. So they started employing people to filter and manage it. They were called \u201cmoderators\u201d and for a long time they were kept firmly under wraps, so that nobody knew about them.</p> <p>That cloak of invisibility began to fray as journalists and scholars started to probe this dark underbelly of social media. What has emerged from their investigations is the realisation that content moderation is now a huge global industry employing at least 100,000 people across the world. Most of these are contract workers rather than staff members and they work in stressful conditions, with little job security or health insurance and suffer psychological damage from having to confront \u2013 and make decisions about \u2013 the horrific stuff that people post on social media platforms.</p> <p>Sarah T Roberts is an academic at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has been exploring this netherworld of commercial content moderation for eight years. Her book <em>Behind the Screen</em> is the first extensive ethnographic study of those who inhabit it. Nobody who reads it will ever again view social media platforms in a tolerant light. For what it reveals is that the tech industry, like all the great industries of the past, prospers on the back of human exploitation. Our social media feeds are kept clean by the unsung and poorly remunerated labour of countless thousands of human beings who have to risk traumatisation so that we shall not.</p> <p>In that sense, social media is rather like the fashion business, endlessly providing diversion and pleasure to western consumers by marking up garments that have been made in the sweatshops of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam.</p> <p>Roberts\u2019s research confirms what scholars such as <a href=\"http://custodiansoftheinternet.org/\" title=\"\">Tarleton Gillespie</a> had suggested \u2013 that far from being a way for social media platforms to demonstrate their sense of social responsibility, content moderation is actually the critical part of their operations, for without it their brands would be irreparably damaged by what unsuspecting users would find in their feeds.</p> <p>After all, one of the platforms\u2019 pitches to users is that they provide safer spaces than the unruly, uncurated web. As one former moderator replied when Roberts asked him what the platform would be like without moderation: \u201cIt would be 100% porn. One hundred per cent. It would be a train wreck. The awful part is, it has to be done. It can\u2019t not be moderated. But there\u2019s no good way to do it.\u201d</p> <p>A key question, which Roberts doesn\u2019t really explore, is whether the moderation task is ultimately a futile, sisyphean one, given the scale at which the platforms operate. Something like 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, for example. The technocratic response to this challenge is a cheery assurance that, one day, AI will take care of most of it. Roberts and her interviewees don\u2019t buy that and neither do I. And even if Facebook or YouTube employed half-a-million human moderators, it wouldn\u2019t be enough, unless something changes.</p> <p>One thing that could make a difference would be for the platforms to \u201cthrottle\u201d uploads to a more manageable rate. Unsurprisingly, this is an option that is never discussed in the industry. As the computer scientist <a href=\"https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/hany-farid\" title=\"\">Hany Farid</a> put it: \u201cThe content is just too valuable a commodity to the platforms; it is the bait that lures users in and keeps them coming back for updates to scroll, new pictures or videos to view, new posts to read and new advertisements to be served.\u201d</p> <p>Corporations such as Google and Facebook that live by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook\" title=\"\">surveillance capitalism</a> may therefore be heading for some kind of existential crisis. On the one hand, they have to keep the supply of uploads coming, for they provide the feedstock for their advertising machines; on the other, if through their contractors they cannot manage the moderation task, then their brands will become polluted and users will start to desert their platforms.</p> <p>But that\u2019s their problem. For us, one of the most striking messages of this remarkable book is that governments and regulators should be investigating the appalling working conditions under which much content moderation is done.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAll human life is there\u201d used to be the proudest boast of the (mercifully) defunct News of the World. Like everything else in that organ, it wasn\u2019t true: the NoW specialised in randy vicars, chorus girls, Tory spankers, pools winners, C-list celebrities and other minority sports. But there is a medium to which the slogan definitely applies \u2013 it\u2019s called the internet. The best metaphor for the net is to think of it as a mirror held up to human nature. All human life really is there. There\u2019s no ideology, fetish, behaviour, obsession, perversion, eccentricity or fad that doesn\u2019t find expression somewhere online. And while much of what we see reflected back to us is uplifting, banal, intriguing, harmless or fascinating, some of it is truly awful, for the simple reason that human nature is not only infinitely diverse but also sometimes unspeakably cruel. In the early days of the internet and, later, the web, this didn\u2019t matter so much. But once cyberspace was captured by a few giant platforms, particularly Google, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, then it became problematic. The business models of these platforms depended on encouraging people to upload content to them in digital torrents. \u201cBroadcast yourself\u201d, remember, was once the motto of YouTube. And people did \u2013 as they slit the throats of hostages in the deserts of Arabia, raped three-year-old girls, shot an old man in the street, firebombed the villages of ethnic minorities or hanged themselves on camera\u2026 All of which posed a problem for the social media brands, which liked to present themselves as facilitators of creativity, connectivity and good clean fun, an image threatened by the tide of crud that was coming at them. So they started employing people to filter and manage it. They were called \u201cmoderators\u201d and for a long time they were kept firmly under wraps, so that nobody knew about them. That cloak of invisibility began to fray as journalists and scholars started to probe this dark underbelly of social media. What has emerged from their investigations is the realisation that content moderation is now a huge global industry employing at least 100,000 people across the world. Most of these are contract workers rather than staff members and they work in stressful conditions, with little job security or health insurance and suffer psychological damage from having to confront \u2013 and make decisions about \u2013 the horrific stuff that people post on social media platforms. Sarah T Roberts is an academic at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has been exploring this netherworld of commercial content moderation for eight years. Her book Behind the Screen is the first extensive ethnographic study of those who inhabit it. Nobody who reads it will ever again view social media platforms in a tolerant light. For what it reveals is that the tech industry, like all the great industries of the past, prospers on the back of human exploitation. Our social media feeds are kept clean by the unsung and poorly remunerated labour of countless thousands of human beings who have to risk traumatisation so that we shall not. In that sense, social media is rather like the fashion business, endlessly providing diversion and pleasure to western consumers by marking up garments that have been made in the sweatshops of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam. Roberts\u2019s research confirms what scholars such as Tarleton Gillespie had suggested \u2013 that far from being a way for social media platforms to demonstrate their sense of social responsibility, content moderation is actually the critical part of their operations, for without it their brands would be irreparably damaged by what unsuspecting users would find in their feeds. After all, one of the platforms\u2019 pitches to users is that they provide safer spaces than the unruly, uncurated web. As one former moderator replied when Roberts asked him what the platform would be like without moderation: \u201cIt would be 100% porn. One hundred per cent. It would be a train wreck. The awful part is, it has to be done. It can\u2019t not be moderated. But there\u2019s no good way to do it.\u201d A key question, which Roberts doesn\u2019t really explore, is whether the moderation task is ultimately a futile, sisyphean one, given the scale at which the platforms operate. Something like 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, for example. The technocratic response to this challenge is a cheery assurance that, one day, AI will take care of most of it. Roberts and her interviewees don\u2019t buy that and neither do I. And even if Facebook or YouTube employed half-a-million human moderators, it wouldn\u2019t be enough, unless something changes. One thing that could make a difference would be for the platforms to \u201cthrottle\u201d uploads to a more manageable rate. Unsurprisingly, this is an option that is never discussed in the industry. As the computer scientist Hany Farid put it: \u201cThe content is just too valuable a commodity to the platforms; it is the bait that lures users in and keeps them coming back for updates to scroll, new pictures or videos to view, new posts to read and new advertisements to be served.\u201d Corporations such as Google and Facebook that live by surveillance capitalism may therefore be heading for some kind of existential crisis. On the one hand, they have to keep the supply of uploads coming, for they provide the feedstock for their advertising machines; on the other, if through their contractors they cannot manage the moderation task, then their brands will become polluted and users will start to desert their platforms. But that\u2019s their problem. For us, one of the most striking messages of this remarkable book is that governments and regulators should be investigating the appalling working conditions under which much content moderation is done. And if you\u2019re the kind of person who balks at buying a T-shirt that has been made in an Asian sweatshop, you might think of giving up Facebook or switching to DuckDuckGo for searching.

The billionaire media mogul, the part Dundee\u2019s own Brian Cox was perhaps born to play, is, if not exactly relishing the comeuppance of his squirrelly, treasonous son Kendall \u2013 who had something of a Chappaquiddick moment at the close of the first series \u2013 not shedding hot salt tears at the turn of events either.</p> <p>Big Daddy Roy now has Kendall whimperingly where he wants him, and Jeremy Strong\u2019s squirms are a painful joy to watch. I can\u2019t praise this HBO drama enough for the overarching quality of all the acting, nor the sheer sense of style as pointlessly privileged progeny snap for scraps at Logan Roy\u2019s table. This series, with the patriarch revivified and vowing to be the last global media brand standing, has the hallmarks of triumph. Part of the delight, aside from the papercut-sharp barbs that come from the pen of Jesse Armstrong every 40 seconds or so, is watching the increasingly easy camaraderie between Roman and Shiv, the (only, it sometimes seems) brains in the batch. Bring it on.</p> <p><strong>Deep Water</strong> is a highly promising new drama from ITV that seems certain to set folk talking. Mainly talking about the shamblefest of mistakes made in the opener by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/10/anna-friel-interview-love-poem\" title=\"\">Anna Friel</a> who, tiddly at a friend\u2019s dinner party, embarks on an ill-advised bathroom knee-trembler.

Throughout, it balances a cloying air of community domesticity with something approaching an air of menace \u2013 menace of sexual threats, of bankruptcy, of misplaced children \u2013 and already I\u2019m wholly intrigued to see quite where it goes with it all. A winner for ITV drama. A loser, perhaps, for the Lake District education system: what with all the special \u201cdays\u201d that the schools apparently now have to celebrate \u2013 book day, vegan day, superhero day, bloody \u201ccake day\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a surprise they can remember to teach anything, if less of a surprise that these three school-gate mothers are going gently mad.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/07/kathy-burke-after-i-got-sick-the-toughest-thing-was-what-it-did-to-my-mental-health\" title=\"\">Kathy Burke</a> was caught between several canyons of compromise in her <strong><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/kathy-burkes-all-woman\" title=\"\">All Woman</a></strong>, the first of a promising triptych: hating the pressures on young women today to beautify themselves to insane degrees yet being, fundamentally, always too bloody nice to inform them that so many pressures are falsely imagined social constructs. I doubt whether anyone other than she could have pulled it off but, somehow, with her mix of sweary derision and personal kindness, she managed. Almost.</p> <p>The derision was best saved for the likes of bollocks-talking plastic surgeons, smug in their patriarchy, or on-trend richos such as the sainted Gwynnie Paltrow.

Laura looked as if someone had just sat a cormorant in her lap. \u201cI really, like, can\u2019t imagine what I\u2019d do.\u201d Burke was, arguably correctly, mild in her facial confrontations with Megan and Laura, not wanting to blame, but there was no shrinking from her later conviction that \u201cit\u2019s not enough to look attractive any more, you have to look <em>stunning</em>\u201d. The causes behind this conviction, though, were sadly unexplored, as were Kathy\u2019s musings on whether women, as well as men, weren\u2019t equally (if not more) societally culpable. But the very presence of the unashamedly homely Burke \u2013 and that of the wonderful grime artist Nadia Rose, whom I seem to remember closing a thrilling <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05dy4s1\" title=\"\">Stax Prom</a> a couple of years ago \u2013 gave hope that sanity might, eventually, get a look-in.</p> <p>Jason Atherton\u2019s slab-faced irascibility on <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00077h7\" title=\"\">The Chefs\u2019 Brigade</a></strong> makes him the ideal leader of a crew of impossibly young wannabes competing against long-established teams in Europe\u2019s finest restaurants: when he gives a compliment, you know he really means it. Even so, even he was struggling in Andaluc\u00eda to prevent his charges from getting too cosily complacent. When he asked who had their new best friends sitting next to them, more than half the hands went up. Wrong response. Atherton had to have a quiet rant about them seeming more \u201cfriends on a food trip\u201d than contestants on a potentially life-altering slice of seriously high-end cooking.</p> <p>I\u2019m quite aware that young people like niceness, and few of us want to hurtle back to a time of utter deference, but what is becoming increasingly evident in this series is that it\u2019s the ones who can take criticism \u2013 or even a simple order \u2013 who will be left standing when the last dish is washed. Platitudes, especially Hallmark-card coddling, won\u2019t cut it.

      "bodyText": "Succession | Sky Atlantic Deep Water (ITV) | ITV Hub Kathy Burke\u2019s All Woman (Channel 4) | All 4 The Chefs\u2019 Brigade (BBC Two) | iPlayer Remarkable Places to Eat (BBC Two) | iPlayer Succession burst back on to our screens with a vengeance: chiefly, of course, Logan Roy\u2019s. The billionaire media mogul, the part Dundee\u2019s own Brian Cox was perhaps born to play, is, if not exactly relishing the comeuppance of his squirrelly, treasonous son Kendall \u2013 who had something of a Chappaquiddick moment at the close of the first series \u2013 not shedding hot salt tears at the turn of events either. Big Daddy Roy now has Kendall whimperingly where he wants him, and Jeremy Strong\u2019s squirms are a painful joy to watch. I can\u2019t praise this HBO drama enough for the overarching quality of all the acting, nor the sheer sense of style as pointlessly privileged progeny snap for scraps at Logan Roy\u2019s table. This series, with the patriarch revivified and vowing to be the last global media brand standing, has the hallmarks of triumph. Part of the delight, aside from the papercut-sharp barbs that come from the pen of Jesse Armstrong every 40 seconds or so, is watching the increasingly easy camaraderie between Roman and Shiv, the (only, it sometimes seems) brains in the batch. Bring it on. Deep Water is a highly promising new drama from ITV that seems certain to set folk talking. Mainly talking about the shamblefest of mistakes made in the opener by Anna Friel who, tiddly at a friend\u2019s dinner party, embarks on an ill-advised bathroom knee-trembler. She doesn\u2019t just forget to close the door, so the kid of the house can see in; she manages to forget her own thong. Later on, she will forget something far, far worse. The three women at the heart of this Windermere-set six-parter, adapted from the novels of Paula Daly, are drawn with heart and finesse, and acted with equal style. Throughout, it balances a cloying air of community domesticity with something approaching an air of menace \u2013 menace of sexual threats, of bankruptcy, of misplaced children \u2013 and already I\u2019m wholly intrigued to see quite where it goes with it all. A winner for ITV drama. A loser, perhaps, for the Lake District education system: what with all the special \u201cdays\u201d that the schools apparently now have to celebrate \u2013 book day, vegan day, superhero day, bloody \u201ccake day\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a surprise they can remember to teach anything, if less of a surprise that these three school-gate mothers are going gently mad. Kathy Burke was caught between several canyons of compromise in her All Woman, the first of a promising triptych: hating the pressures on young women today to beautify themselves to insane degrees yet being, fundamentally, always too bloody nice to inform them that so many pressures are falsely imagined social constructs. I doubt whether anyone other than she could have pulled it off but, somehow, with her mix of sweary derision and personal kindness, she managed. Almost. The derision was best saved for the likes of bollocks-talking plastic surgeons, smug in their patriarchy, or on-trend richos such as the sainted Gwynnie Paltrow. No one on earth, I\u2019ll wager, can pronounce the phrase \u201cSteam your fanny? Fack off\u201d with quite such intense, laughing scorn as Ms Burke. She was on shakier ground with Love Island \u201cstar\u201d Megan Barton-Hanson, who got pelters on social media for having dared transform her body, yet after reams of plastic surgery still has to spend two hours prepping for a C-list red-carpet photo; or 20-year-old Laura, saving for a boob job. The operation is a bit scary, she admitted, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s going to make me happy\u201d. What, Burke wondered gently, if it didn\u2019t? Laura looked as if someone had just sat a cormorant in her lap. \u201cI really, like, can\u2019t imagine what I\u2019d do.\u201d Burke was, arguably correctly, mild in her facial confrontations with Megan and Laura, not wanting to blame, but there was no shrinking from her later conviction that \u201cit\u2019s not enough to look attractive any more, you have to look stunning\u201d. The causes behind this conviction, though, were sadly unexplored, as were Kathy\u2019s musings on whether women, as well as men, weren\u2019t equally (if not more) societally culpable. But the very presence of the unashamedly homely Burke \u2013 and that of the wonderful grime artist Nadia Rose, whom I seem to remember closing a thrilling Stax Prom a couple of years ago \u2013 gave hope that sanity might, eventually, get a look-in. Jason Atherton\u2019s slab-faced irascibility on The Chefs\u2019 Brigade makes him the ideal leader of a crew of impossibly young wannabes competing against long-established teams in Europe\u2019s finest restaurants: when he gives a compliment, you know he really means it. Even so, even he was struggling in Andaluc\u00eda to prevent his charges from getting too cosily complacent. When he asked who had their new best friends sitting next to them, more than half the hands went up. Wrong response. Atherton had to have a quiet rant about them seeming more \u201cfriends on a food trip\u201d than contestants on a potentially life-altering slice of seriously high-end cooking. I\u2019m quite aware that young people like niceness, and few of us want to hurtle back to a time of utter deference, but what is becoming increasingly evident in this series is that it\u2019s the ones who can take criticism \u2013 or even a simple order \u2013 who will be left standing when the last dish is washed. Platitudes, especially Hallmark-card coddling, won\u2019t cut it. When over-sensitive, over-angry Frankie said: \u201cI\u2019m not disappointed in myself,\u201d after having loused up on the caramel, he was instantly comforted by a colleague, who petted the nothing phrase \u201cand that\u2019s the most important thing\u201d.

For the year as a whole, they are forecasting pre-tax profits of \u00a31.06bn, just down from last year\u2019s record \u00a31.09bn \u2013 the biggest ever made by a UK housebuilder. \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

      "bodyText": "All change at No 10 Winston Churchill, the Queen\u2019s first prime minister, died in early 1965. The Conservative party was changing and a key beneficiary was a Grantham schoolgirl and Oxford graduate turned ice-cream chemist turned barrister. After Edward Heath led the Conservatives to a surprise victory in the election of 1970 (the first election in which 18-year-olds could vote), Margaret Thatcher was appointed education secretary. In 1975, as series three draws to a close, Thatcher \u2013 played by Gillian Anderson \u2013 became leader of the opposition. Expect fireworks. Rhodesia declares independence The Queen was a passionate devotee of the Commonwealth as a union of nations. But this unity was severely strained in Rhodesia. By 1965, Britain was pushing the white government of Rhodesia to embrace black majority rule and an end to racial discrimination. When Ian Smith, of the Rhodesian Front party, issued a unilateral declaration of independence, declaring Elizabeth II Queen of Rhodesia, Britain instituted sanctions and the UN declared it a racist and illegal regime. Zimbabwean liberation parties and key leaders such as Robert Mugabe supported armed resistance. South Africa, Zambia and the US pressured the white government to back down. In 1976, Smith agreed to accept black majority rule in two years \u2013 but it was not until 1980 that the Republic of Zimbabwe became an independent country. The moon landings In 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped on to the moon. In series three, the moon landings will prompt a career crisis for Prince Philip. The moon landings were a giant step for mankind, but most of all for the US. Not only had Russia lost the race, but Britain had lost its empire and America had become the great leader, cemented by the moon landings as the great adventurer, the winner of the science race \u2013 and the world\u2019s policeman. Britain joins the EEC On 1 January 1973, Britain, Ireland and Denmark joined the six other countries in the European Economic Community. In a referendum called in 1975, 67 per cent voted to stay in the EEC. Britain became more connected to Europe, with the rise of the package holiday and greater interest in European food and culture (the first Pizza Express opened in 1965). In 1964, the British and French governments agreed on a Channel tunnel between France and England by the end of the decade (it opened in 1994).

      "bodyText": "New criminal penalties and a scheme to identify company directors are urgently needed to crack down on the scourge of illegal phoenixing activity, according to the peak body of insolvency practitioners. Both measures are contained in the Morrison government\u2019s Combating Illegal Phoenixing bill but the Australian Restructuring Insolvency &amp; Turnaround Association is frustrated at the pace of reform after the bill was allowed to lapse at the May election. \u201cDespite the claims of action by government, unfortunately almost nothing is really being done,\u201d the ARITA chief executive, John Winter, told Guardian Australia. ARITA wrote to federal parliamentarians this week urging them to do more to combat phoenixing \u2013 a practice where under-capitalised companies intentionally go into liquidation to avoid paying creditors and workers\u2019 entitlements \u2013 warning that reforms should be in place ahead of potential economic downturn. PwC estimates that phoenixing cost the Australian economy at least $5bn in 2016-17, including $3.2bn in unpaid bills, $300m in unpaid employee entitlements and $1.7bn in unpaid taxes and compliance costs. In February the Morrison government introduced the phoenixing bill, which lapsed when parliament was dissolved ahead of the May election. The assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, reintroduced it in July. Sukkar told the House of Representatives illegal phoenixing \u201chas been a problem for many decades\u201d and boasted the bill would give regulators the ability to \u201cprosecute or penalise directors and others who facilitate this illegal activity, such as unscrupulous pre-insolvency advisers\u201d. Under the new criminal offences illegal asset stripping would attract penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment. The ARITA report to MPs and senators says the bill \u201cgoes some way to addressing this issue and is worthy of support but much more focus is still needed to protect the community as a whole from this scourge\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning ARITA noted the phoenixing bill would also create a director identity number, \u201clinking their past and present directorships to help prevent illegal phoenixing and limit the damage done by inept entrepreneurs\u201d. It said this would require \u201cresourcing and prioritising a complete overhaul of the ASIC register\u201d. In addition to higher penalties and the director identity number, ARITA wants: a greater focus on enforcement actions by the corporate regulator, Asic; abolition of fees on its members which it claims are \u201ceffectively working as an extension of the regulator for free\u201d; and a crackdown on unregulated \u201cpre-insolvency advisors\u201d it claims help companies avoid their obligations. On Friday Guardian Australia reported that Asic is yet to use powers it gained in April to disqualify company directors or managers who improperly access the taxpayer-funded safety net to pay workers of their failed companies, because the lack of retrospective effect of the laws means no officers eligible for the penalty have yet been identified. Winter said ARITA had been \u201cpushing the government for reform\u201d because its members \u201care at the frontline of combatting phoenixing \u2013 they uncover it long before the ATO or Asic are even remotely aware of it\u201d.

      "body": "<p>This week\u2019s column is not for the fainthearted, or if you are super sensitive to smell. But if you are looking for a chemical- or manure-free fertiliser then, please, read on.</p> <p>We start with a hazard warning. It really will smell. A lot. Your garden neighbours will notice. They may disapprove.</p> <p>First, you will need a container with a tight lid. A plastic barrel with a screw top is best. Ours once held mango chutney. Keep it far from gardening friends.</p> <p>We use two plant varieties as the base: comfrey, our preference, and nettles. With comfrey, you might wait until before or after flowering as bees and other insects love them.</p> <p>We make around three preparations a season. It couldn\u2019t be more simple. Cut armfuls of comfrey and/or nettles. Pack them in a barrel. Fill with water until near the top. Remember to tightly screw on the lid. And wait.</p> <p>After a few weeks, you will be happily gardening, but will be distracted by an oddly pervasive odour.</p> <p>When you lift the lid, you may see a crust, with white, worm-like funghi. Your brew is ready. Be prepared for the stink (though you likely won\u2019t be). I\u2019d advise long and strong rubberised gloves. You\u2019ll also need a jug.</p> <p>Pour your brew into a watering can. We vary from a ratio of around 20-1 to around 10 (sometimes stronger), depending on potency and impatience.

      "bodyText": "This week\u2019s column is not for the fainthearted, or if you are super sensitive to smell. But if you are looking for a chemical- or manure-free fertiliser then, please, read on. We start with a hazard warning. It really will smell. A lot. Your garden neighbours will notice. They may disapprove. First, you will need a container with a tight lid. A plastic barrel with a screw top is best. Ours once held mango chutney. Keep it far from gardening friends. We use two plant varieties as the base: comfrey, our preference, and nettles. With comfrey, you might wait until before or after flowering as bees and other insects love them. We make around three preparations a season. It couldn\u2019t be more simple. Cut armfuls of comfrey and/or nettles. Pack them in a barrel. Fill with water until near the top. Remember to tightly screw on the lid. And wait. After a few weeks, you will be happily gardening, but will be distracted by an oddly pervasive odour. When you lift the lid, you may see a crust, with white, worm-like funghi. Your brew is ready. Be prepared for the stink (though you likely won\u2019t be). I\u2019d advise long and strong rubberised gloves. You\u2019ll also need a jug. Pour your brew into a watering can. We vary from a ratio of around 20-1 to around 10 (sometimes stronger), depending on potency and impatience. Top up slowly with water. It may bubble like honeycomb. Apply liberally to the soil late in the day or your neighbours may complain. We give stronger doses to squashes than leaf crops. We also water it in. Take care not to spill on your clothes. Your \u2018herbal tea\u2019 will give your growing a boost, help replenish plants. Lastly, pick late sweet peas or night-scented phlox or stocks. Breathe them in.

Many bigger and more commercial brands, on the other hand, assume everyone will love their \u2018blockbuster\u2019 scent. Nowhere is this more palpable than at the numerous fragrance launches I attend. As I sniff the scent blotter, a beaming brand representative will excitedly utter the line: \u2018What do you think? It\u2019s amazing, right?\u2019 I\u2019ve had situations where, if I was being brutally honest, my response would be, \u2018Well actually, it is nauseatingly revolting and you are all suffering from emperor\u2019s new clothes syndrome.\u2019 Thankfully there are launches \u2013 like Lanc\u00f4me\u2019s Id\u00f4le \u2013 that take me by surprise and I become so pathetically adoring that I have stern words with myself to avoid veering into sycophancy. The scent - bergamot, rose, jasmine with a base of cedar and patchouli \u2013 is feminine, sexy, grown-up and smells more expensive than it is. Then there\u2019s the architecture of the bottle. At just 15mm, it is possibly the slimmest in the world. Thinner than your iPhone. Teeny gripe: it doesn\u2019t stand up, so you have to lie it flat. Still, considering its merits \u2013 oh, and did I mention it\u2019s refillable and its sustainable ingredients? \u2013 I\u2019ll overlook that. So all in all, glorious. Which is more than I can say for many fragrance launches. <em>Lanc\u00f4me Id\u00f4le, from \u00a348 <a href=\"https://www.lancome.co.uk/\" title=\"\">lancome.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2><strong>On my radar: Fine fragrances, a quick peel and new foundations</strong></h2> <p><strong>Just a minute </strong>Chock full of skin-refining acids such as salicylic and glycolic, this exfoliating peeling mask has been proven to renew skin texture and brighten complexions in 60 seconds.

Urban Decay Stay Naked Foundation \u00a329.50, boots.com I can\u2019t do without: a flat bottle of sexy scent that fits in your palm Clever niche fragrance brands understand they can\u2019t appeal to everyone. Many bigger and more commercial brands, on the other hand, assume everyone will love their \u2018blockbuster\u2019 scent. Nowhere is this more palpable than at the numerous fragrance launches I attend. As I sniff the scent blotter, a beaming brand representative will excitedly utter the line: \u2018What do you think? It\u2019s amazing, right?\u2019 I\u2019ve had situations where, if I was being brutally honest, my response would be, \u2018Well actually, it is nauseatingly revolting and you are all suffering from emperor\u2019s new clothes syndrome.\u2019 Thankfully there are launches \u2013 like Lanc\u00f4me\u2019s Id\u00f4le \u2013 that take me by surprise and I become so pathetically adoring that I have stern words with myself to avoid veering into sycophancy. The scent - bergamot, rose, jasmine with a base of cedar and patchouli \u2013 is feminine, sexy, grown-up and smells more expensive than it is. Then there\u2019s the architecture of the bottle. At just 15mm, it is possibly the slimmest in the world. Thinner than your iPhone. Teeny gripe: it doesn\u2019t stand up, so you have to lie it flat. Still, considering its merits \u2013 oh, and did I mention it\u2019s refillable and its sustainable ingredients? \u2013 I\u2019ll overlook that. So all in all, glorious. Which is more than I can say for many fragrance launches. Lanc\u00f4me Id\u00f4le, from \u00a348 lancome.co.uk On my radar: Fine fragrances, a quick peel and new foundations Just a minute Chock full of skin-refining acids such as salicylic and glycolic, this exfoliating peeling mask has been proven to renew skin texture and brighten complexions in 60 seconds.

But they are no longer in power and their message of hope has been replaced by fear, exclusion, hatred and ignorance. Unfortunately, Kaiser doesn\u2019t really take on Trump and the shift from a forward-moving to a backward-looking political reality. That\u2019s a shame because he is such a sharp political observer. I expect he might see Trump as a striking aberration in the American story of progress. If gay people can survive Aids, then they can survive Trump, the hopeful logic might run. More to the point, Kaiser invests a great deal of faith in America\u2019s youth, out of whom new movements for change necessarily grow. It may be in our \u201cqueer\u201d youth, rather than our \u201cgay\u201d youth, that the route out of Trump\u2019s deep morass can be found.

I always knew the tweezers in my Swiss Army knife would be handy one day\u2026 High on the Col du Tourmalet, we worked until late in a windblown tent, writing Geraint Thomas\u2019s epitaph and anticipating Thibaut Pinot\u2019s coming of age, before descending through the hairpins behind a police convoy of flashing lights and burning rubber into the valley and just making dinner \u2014 cassoulet in case you wondered \u2014 at the foot of the Pyrenees. By the time we reached Uzes, it was hot enough to fry an egg on the bonnet. Heat exhaustion floored colleagues in the \u201cpress room\u201d \u2014 a sweltering airless gymnasium in 43C heat \u2014 while Danish star Jakob Fuglsang\u2019s broken hand reduced him to a wounded animal as he quit the Tour, sobbing uncontrollably. The final major challenge came in the Alps. The race would be decided there, careers made and broken on the crucible of stress and fatigue that is the Tour\u2019s final week. Yet the 3008 motored serenely on, even as I finally wilted. Landslides and apocalyptic storms swept through the high passes, reminding me of the great laundry disaster of the 1996 Tour when I shunted the rear end of the Ouest France car in a blizzard and they couldn\u2019t get their suitcases out of the boot for a week. There was a long, lone, late-night drive, up and over the remote Col de Petit St Bernard, to my hotel in Italy, that tested both me and the Peugeot, but we got to the hotel intact. Exhausted, I slept like a baby with the window open, an overflowing mountain torrent raging in the ravine below. After that, it was almost all downhill, to Lyon, then Paris, and at last, the Champs Elysees. It was champagne for a wide-eyed Bernal, a very cold beer for red-eyed me \u2013 and a grateful pat on the bonnet for the trusty Peugeot.",

The majority of MPs who have expressed their opposition to a no-deal Brexit have to live with two realities they may find unacceptable. Jeremy Corbyn is a committed socialist, careless of division and widely distrusted. Boris Johnson is a prime minister steering Britain full tilt towards a moment of national peril propelled solely by the exigencies of extreme rightwing politics. Yet it is Corbyn who has tried to break the deadlock.</p> <p>It is against this background that MPs beyond the rightwing English nationalist laager into which Johnson has locked his party must assess Corbyn\u2019s offer to create a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/jeremy-corbyn-urges-opposition-leaders-and-tory-rebels-to-help-oust-pm\" title=\"\">time-limited national government</a>. Its sole mission would be to agree an extension of the date for leaving the EU beyond 31 October. This would allow a general election to take place, with Labour campaigning on its promise to be \u201ccommitted to a public vote on the terms of leaving the EU, including an option to remain\u201d. It will be a steady state administration, enacting no new policies, nor initiating any new spending, lasting for the few weeks necessary to bridge into the next parliament.</p> <p>Voters will have the opportunity to express their support for no deal or for a second referendum with Remain on the ballot paper. There will be no fait accompli of a no-deal Brexit imposed on the UK. Crucially, the cabinet secretary could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/08/corbyn-johnson-plotting-abuse-of-power-to-force-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">give Corbyn no assurance</a> such a risk could otherwise be avoided. Constitutionally, neither a vote of no confidence in Johnson nor a parliamentary vote against no deal will stop it going ahead on 31 October if the government refuses to act in response. In sum, Corbyn\u2019s initiative to create a bridge government to avoid this fate is an imperative that deserves a positive hearing.</p> <p>To leave the European Union with no process agreed for determining the gamut of our future relationships with the continent of which we are a part would be an act of extreme folly and national self-harm. There is no mandate for this; as Corbyn argued, it was not mentioned in the referendum. Indeed, it was excluded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/16/jo-swinson-lib-dems-clarke-harman-interim-pm-jeremy-corbyn-pressure\">Jo Swinson says she would work with Labour to avoid no-deal Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The immediate impact of a no-deal Brexit on 1 November is unknowable but likely to involve rupture to key supplies of fresh foods and crucial medicines. The consequences may or may not be manageable. More serious, long-term and unmanageable will be the impact in the years ahead \u2013 prolonged recession, a slump in business confidence, collapsed sterling, endangered national security, the almost certain break-up of the kingdom, frozen careers and a gathering exodus of the many companies that have made Britain their home. International collaboration involving Britain on any initiative \u2013 from space to security, trade to finance \u2013 will become impossibly difficult.</p> <p>This will happen against a darkening backdrop where already volatile financial markets are warning of a global recession and the threat of a full-blown trade war. It is thus that Corbyn\u2019s offer deserves the most constructive response possible from MPs who have the national interest as their prime concern. It does not require non-Labour MPs to act as if they are endorsing his socialism or to suspend their distrust of him and his policies. Rather, it is to back a short-term bridge government whose sole purpose is to organise a general election, with new political options and a fresh electoral mandate.</p> <p>The reflex reaction of the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/15/corbyns-plan-to-lead-caretaker-government-unworkable-say-lib-dems\" title=\"\">initially dismiss the initiative</a> was wrong. It is good she has partially climbed down as politically adeptly as possible given her earlier misstep. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/15/corbyns-plan-to-lead-caretaker-government-unworkable-say-lib-dems\" title=\"\">touting Ken Clarke and Harriet Harman</a> as joint leaders of a parallel initiative should be seen for what it is: cover for her climbdown. No temporary government is possible without the support of Labour MPs and their leader. She is right to signal she is now keeping the lines open and her new recruit, Sarah Wollaston, importantly recognised the nature of the choice. Politics, as she has learned the hard way, is brutal.</p> <p>But even with Lib Dem support, it will need up to a dozen Conservatives to swing behind the opposition parties to form the bridge government. Tory MP Guto Bebb is right to frame the decision not as one of putting \u201cCorbyn into Downing Street\u201d, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/16/dominic-grieve-jeremy-corbyn-no-10-labour-brexit\" title=\"\">Dominic Grieve has done</a>, but, rather, as a generational choice in the context of a national calamity. Grieve, like Swinson, should climb down and reframe the nature of the decision. Yet it is for all Tory MPs a fateful moment. Do they collude in the process of turning their party into a fully fledged English nationalist party, plunging Britain into crisis in a no-deal Brexit? Or do they speak up for country?</p> <p>No one knows how an election will pan out, but there is no doubt that it must be the right course. This paper has not stinted in its criticism of Corbyn\u2019s twists and turns, not least over his and his party\u2019s lack of clarity over Brexit, but on this issue he is unequivocally right. Without a majority in the current parliament for a referendum, Britain must have a bridge government to hold an election and put the calamity of a no-deal Brexit to the people, along with the option of a second referendum and Remain. Corbyn\u2019s offer must be kept alive. Democracy and the national interest demand no less.</p>",

Rather, it is to back a short-term bridge government whose sole purpose is to organise a general election, with new political options and a fresh electoral mandate. The reflex reaction of the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, to initially dismiss the initiative was wrong. It is good she has partially climbed down as politically adeptly as possible given her earlier misstep. But touting Ken Clarke and Harriet Harman as joint leaders of a parallel initiative should be seen for what it is: cover for her climbdown. No temporary government is possible without the support of Labour MPs and their leader. She is right to signal she is now keeping the lines open and her new recruit, Sarah Wollaston, importantly recognised the nature of the choice. Politics, as she has learned the hard way, is brutal. But even with Lib Dem support, it will need up to a dozen Conservatives to swing behind the opposition parties to form the bridge government. Tory MP Guto Bebb is right to frame the decision not as one of putting \u201cCorbyn into Downing Street\u201d, as Dominic Grieve has done, but, rather, as a generational choice in the context of a national calamity. Grieve, like Swinson, should climb down and reframe the nature of the decision. Yet it is for all Tory MPs a fateful moment. Do they collude in the process of turning their party into a fully fledged English nationalist party, plunging Britain into crisis in a no-deal Brexit? Or do they speak up for country? No one knows how an election will pan out, but there is no doubt that it must be the right course. This paper has not stinted in its criticism of Corbyn\u2019s twists and turns, not least over his and his party\u2019s lack of clarity over Brexit, but on this issue he is unequivocally right. Without a majority in the current parliament for a referendum, Britain must have a bridge government to hold an election and put the calamity of a no-deal Brexit to the people, along with the option of a second referendum and Remain. Corbyn\u2019s offer must be kept alive. Democracy and the national interest demand no less.",

Ten days earlier, in the spring of 2016, she had gone for her first scan with her husband, Matt, and their two-year-old daughter. At the appointment, a nurse told her she had miscarried; the baby had no heartbeat. McKeown opted to let nature run its course and give birth, rather than have a procedure (dilation and curettage) or an induced labour. Her stillborn baby was born at home a few days later. McKeown ended up bedridden for six weeks, and haemorrhaged heavily for almost 10, causing frequent blackouts. When she returned to work, she lost her job in a redundancy round as part of \u201ca strategic business decision\u201d by EY (Ernst &amp; Young) as the firm exited an area of the business. \u201cI was worn down,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if a family loses one of two incomes and weren\u2019t planning for it, it\u2019s quite a difficult thing.\u201d McKeown, traumatised yet emboldened by her experience, has since been fighting to change the law to ensure that women are given better employment protection, whether they get pregnant, miscarry or give birth.

      "body": "<p>\u2018The jumbo jets, now increasingly common over London, have marked the start of the new age,\u2019 writes Eric Clark in the <em>Observer Magazine</em> of 24 May 1970 (<em>Hotels: A Guest\u2019s Guide for the 1970s</em>). \u2018The big question is whether the mass movement in the air can be matched with enough of the right hotel accommodation on the ground.\u2019</p> <p>Clark advises that, \u2018Most hotels now being built in Britain will be in the medium price range, anything from \u00a35 to \u00a310 per night\u2026 But the future is less happy for the mass-age traveller hoping for a hotel bed at less than \u00a35 a night.\u2019</p> <p>And what will these establishments be like? \u2019Tomorrow\u2019s hotels will be more, not less, anonymous. Food will consist of packaged and convenience foods. The ice \u2013 even coffee \u2013 may be self-served from a machine.\u2019 I\u2019m looking at you, 21st-century Nespresso. (And where\u2019s the ice?)</p> <p>\u2018It may not be as exciting,\u2019 Clark continues, \u2018but it should be a good deal more comfortable.\u2019 And comfort is the word when Clark stays at the imposing Grand Hotel in Rome \u2013 just to check the difference, of course. It is \u2018a vast, living monument to the heyday of wandering monarchs, five-hour dinners, servants\u2019 quarters, and the kind of space that could give a modern hotel tycoon, worried about costings and labour charges, a heart attack.\u2019</p> <p>Naturally, there are standards the guests have to adhere to at the Grand, such as men being required to wear ties when eating. And some standards are much higher \u2013 the Ritz in Madrid, for example, won\u2019t take film stars as \u2018the publicity surrounding them is thought to cause too much bother to other guests\u2019.</p> <p>Of course, what really makes a grand hotel grand is the service, including the concierge \u2018fixers\u2019. A good one, claims Clark, \u2018will get guests into audiences with the Pope \u2013 cutting down to a few hours the months of waiting usually involved\u2019. Now all we want from a hotel is good wifi.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018The jumbo jets, now increasingly common over London, have marked the start of the new age,\u2019 writes Eric Clark in the Observer Magazine of 24 May 1970 (Hotels: A Guest\u2019s Guide for the 1970s). \u2018The big question is whether the mass movement in the air can be matched with enough of the right hotel accommodation on the ground.\u2019 Clark advises that, \u2018Most hotels now being built in Britain will be in the medium price range, anything from \u00a35 to \u00a310 per night\u2026 But the future is less happy for the mass-age traveller hoping for a hotel bed at less than \u00a35 a night.\u2019 And what will these establishments be like? \u2019Tomorrow\u2019s hotels will be more, not less, anonymous. Food will consist of packaged and convenience foods. The ice \u2013 even coffee \u2013 may be self-served from a machine.\u2019 I\u2019m looking at you, 21st-century Nespresso. (And where\u2019s the ice?) \u2018It may not be as exciting,\u2019 Clark continues, \u2018but it should be a good deal more comfortable.\u2019 And comfort is the word when Clark stays at the imposing Grand Hotel in Rome \u2013 just to check the difference, of course. It is \u2018a vast, living monument to the heyday of wandering monarchs, five-hour dinners, servants\u2019 quarters, and the kind of space that could give a modern hotel tycoon, worried about costings and labour charges, a heart attack.\u2019 Naturally, there are standards the guests have to adhere to at the Grand, such as men being required to wear ties when eating. And some standards are much higher \u2013 the Ritz in Madrid, for example, won\u2019t take film stars as \u2018the publicity surrounding them is thought to cause too much bother to other guests\u2019. Of course, what really makes a grand hotel grand is the service, including the concierge \u2018fixers\u2019. A good one, claims Clark, \u2018will get guests into audiences with the Pope \u2013 cutting down to a few hours the months of waiting usually involved\u2019. Now all we want from a hotel is good wifi.",

I wanted to nurse my anger.</p> <p>I just wish it had been the only sin committed against good taste and good manners that evening. It wasn\u2019t. As ever I had expected so much more. This is because I\u2019m a fool. Bourne &amp; Hollingsworth is a self-styled \u201ccreative lifestyle company\u201d. They \u201ccurate beautiful spaces\u201d.

Only the 10th floor is available to the public. Normally, I stick to a mantra: never eat in a restaurant that is on a boat, that turns or has a view because it won\u2019t ever be about the food. But B&amp;H talks a good game, and I adore London\u2019s roof tops, those unexpected views of hidden terraces; of windows turned to the sky; of skyscrapers piercing the clouds and, in the distance, the place where the city gives way to the country. The Garden Room view really is spectacular and on a summer\u2019s evening, as the sun dips behind the capital\u2019s glass cliff faces, it feels like a special place to be.</p> <p>Then the nice waiters start bringing the terrible food. It is a brutal exercise in portion control and failed staff motivation. I genuinely don\u2019t think the kitchen wants to be this clumsy and graceless; I just suspect they\u2019ve been given no particular reason to do otherwise. We start with king prawn and chestnut mushroom skewers with b\u00e9arnaise sauce, which bring to mind the old Jewish joke: \u201cOi, the food is awful, and the portions, so small.\u201d For \u00a310.50 you get four tough and underseasoned prawns and three flabby and undercooked mushrooms. Weirdly, the b\u00e9arnaise seems to have wandered in from another kitchen; one where someone cares. It\u2019s thick and frothy and rich with fresh tarragon.</p> <p>There is only one way to deal with this trauma. Order the crispy kale salad. The new trauma will deaden the old. The crispy bits appear to have been deep-fried a long time before we made the mistake of coming. They are cold and leak vegetable oil into your mouth as you bite in. There are also soggy leaves of undressed, steamed kale; thuds of green matter, waiting to be composted. Occasionally you uncover a piece of roasted carrot that is mildly pleasant. There are nuts which, like my hopes and dreams, are crushed. It costs \u00a310.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2effaa546c4309f48ec246cc86131bfc40ec9a94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2effaa546c4309f48ec246cc86131bfc40ec9a94/0_230_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There are nuts which, like my hopes and dreams, are crushed\u2019: crispy kale salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There are nuts which, like my hopes and dreams, are crushed\u2019: crispy kale salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.bandhgardenroom.com/breakfast\" title=\"\">menu</a> is the equivalent of eager dad dancing.

      "bodyText": "MPs and senators should receive foreign affairs and national intelligence briefings about China to remedy the government\u2019s failure to discuss Australia\u2019s relationship with the emerging superpower, Penny Wong has suggested. Labor\u2019s shadow foreign affairs spokeswoman made the call on Sunday, citing the growing number of Coalition backbenchers raising concerns about China and free speech at Australian universities as evidence the government has failed to lead the conversation. Last week the Liberal chair of the intelligence and security committee, Andrew Hastie, warned the belief that China will liberalise leaves the West as vulnerable as France was to Nazi Germany. The comments were widely criticised for their inflammatory tone \u2013 but not for the substance of his warning that Australia should not compromise its sovereignty for the sake of its trading partnership with China. On Sunday the Liberal backbenchers Amanda Stoker, Tim Wilson, Dave Sharma and James Paterson warned that Australian universities must protect free speech to prevent the silencing of non-Chinese Communist Party-aligned international students, after heated campus protests about the handling of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Wong told Insiders \u201cit\u2019s time for the prime minister [Scott Morrison] and the foreign minister [Marise Payne] to lead a calm and mature discussion on China\u201d. \u201cWe have backbenchers out there making a whole range of comments \u2013 I think it would be far better at a time where it\u2019s a complex relationship and getting more so that we have a mature, sensible and calm discussion about our relationship with China and how we make it work for us \u2013 and that should be led by the government. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be led by backbenchers \u2013 and the fact backbenchers are feeling the need to lead it, is I think, a demonstration of the failure of the government to do so,\u201d she said, citing Hastie\u2019s comments about the \u201cintellectual failure\u201d of the discussion. Wong said she would write to Payne and request that parliamentarians receive briefings on China from the department of foreign affairs and the office of national intelligence \u201cbecause we are at a point where the relationship is much more complex, [and] more consequential\u201d. Wong said the debate would be \u201cmore informed\u201d than current comments designed to fill the \u201cleadership vacuum\u201d. Wong said some of Hastie\u2019s comments were valid, others were \u201cinflammatory\u201d, but he should not be the one to frame the discussion. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman said Australia should \u201calways stand for who we are \u2026 protect our sovereignty, and assert our values and the strength of our democracy\u201d. Despite Australia\u2019s strong trading partnership with China, the relationship has been inflamed by the dispute over the South China Sea, perceptions Australia\u2019s foreign interference package was targeted at China, the escalating trade war between China and the US, and protests about the situation in Hong Kong. On Saturday a second pro-Hong Kong rally was held in Melbourne\u2019s CBD after clashes with Chinese nationalists on Friday night sparked a police warning that violence would not be tolerated. On Sunday Stoker told the Sun Herald universities were battling through a \u201ccrisis of leadership\u201d on foreign influence, with administrators reluctant \u201cto defend the rights of non-CCP aligned students who dare to speak out against Beijing\u201d. Paterson reportedly said campus protests shone a spotlight on the foreign influence risks at Australian universities \u201cboth as a by-product of the hunger for international students and more deliberate efforts at influence\u201d. Wong also continued Labor\u2019s critique that the government\u2019s record of rising emissions and attempts to use Kyoto carryover credits left it with little credibility discussing climate change, arguing that Scott Morrison had diminished Australia\u2019s influence at the Pacific Islands Forum where it was roundly criticised by Pacific leaders. China will \u201ccontinue to expand its influence\u201d as a result, she warned. Wong confirmed that \u201cof course\u201d Labor would also have rejected attempts at the PIF to phase out the coal export industry, describing it as an \u201cimportant industry\u201d and noting coal \u201cremains part of the global energy mix\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>It was always going to be a showdown on the climate crisis.</p> <p>As leaders from the Pacific gathered in Tuvalu for their annual Pacific Islands Forum, there was one subject destined to dwarf all others and which pitted Australia, with its increasing emissions and plans for new coalmines, against its small island neighbours.</p> <p>And PIF 2019 turned out to be exactly that: a reckoning on the climate emergency confronting the Pacific.</p> <p>There were moving speeches from young Pasifika speaking of their fears for their future, tears in the leaders\u2019 retreat, and accusations that Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, had shown such disrespect toward his counterparts during their marathon 12-hour meeting, that the Fijian prime minister said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/fiji-pm-frank-bainimarama-insulting-scott-morrison-rift-pacific-countries\">Pacific countries may be driven further into the arms of China</a>.</p> <p>The choice of location for the forum was significant. Tuvalu, located about two hours on a plane north of Fiji, is one of the countries most at risk. The main island, where the capital, Funafuti, is located, is an ever-decreasing sliver of land, at its narrowest just 20m wide, and just 3m above sea level. It faces a host of problems including salinity of the water table, which makes growing crops extremely difficult, coastal erosion that is seeing islands crumble into the sea, storm surges and rising temperatures.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You are trying to save your economy, I am trying to save my people</p> <footer> <cite>Enele Sopoaga</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The event was a huge undertaking for Tuvalu, which is designated as a \u201cleast developed country\u201d and has a population of around 11,000 people. The convention centre, as well as about 75% of accommodation used for the event, was built specifically for the conference, and right up until people started arriving for the forum, Tuvaluans were laying electricity cables, painting, bringing in furniture \u2013 and working in shifts around the clock to get ready. </p> <p>To feed delegates, different communities from Tuvalu\u2019s outer islands took turns preparing and bringing in food, presenting lavish lunches and dinners of crab, lobster, fish, chicken, salads, taro and custard coconut cake. On several nights, large traditional dances or <em>fateles </em>were held, with the different islands taking it in turn to run the night\u2019s entertainment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb7bf78b229fd3080d4e39127238366cca95422e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7bf78b229fd3080d4e39127238366cca95422e/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Locals cook fish on an umu, or traditional earth oven, by the lagoon in Funafuti.

      "bodyText": "It was always going to be a showdown on the climate crisis. As leaders from the Pacific gathered in Tuvalu for their annual Pacific Islands Forum, there was one subject destined to dwarf all others and which pitted Australia, with its increasing emissions and plans for new coalmines, against its small island neighbours. And PIF 2019 turned out to be exactly that: a reckoning on the climate emergency confronting the Pacific. There were moving speeches from young Pasifika speaking of their fears for their future, tears in the leaders\u2019 retreat, and accusations that Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, had shown such disrespect toward his counterparts during their marathon 12-hour meeting, that the Fijian prime minister said Pacific countries may be driven further into the arms of China. The choice of location for the forum was significant. Tuvalu, located about two hours on a plane north of Fiji, is one of the countries most at risk. The main island, where the capital, Funafuti, is located, is an ever-decreasing sliver of land, at its narrowest just 20m wide, and just 3m above sea level. It faces a host of problems including salinity of the water table, which makes growing crops extremely difficult, coastal erosion that is seeing islands crumble into the sea, storm surges and rising temperatures. The event was a huge undertaking for Tuvalu, which is designated as a \u201cleast developed country\u201d and has a population of around 11,000 people. The convention centre, as well as about 75% of accommodation used for the event, was built specifically for the conference, and right up until people started arriving for the forum, Tuvaluans were laying electricity cables, painting, bringing in furniture \u2013 and working in shifts around the clock to get ready. To feed delegates, different communities from Tuvalu\u2019s outer islands took turns preparing and bringing in food, presenting lavish lunches and dinners of crab, lobster, fish, chicken, salads, taro and custard coconut cake. On several nights, large traditional dances or fateles were held, with the different islands taking it in turn to run the night\u2019s entertainment. Tuvalu\u2019s prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, told the Guardian ahead of the conference that Tuvalu was seeing the event as an opportunity to showcase its culture \u2013 to show the world what would be lost, apart from land, if Tuvalu were to disappear. From the opening speech of the climate crisis summit, delivered by Fiji\u2019s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, held the day before the forum officially opened, it was clear that Pacific leaders had their eyes on one forum member country in particular when it came to climate action. \u201cI appeal to Australia to do everything possible to achieve a rapid transition from coal to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change,\u201d he said, adding that coal posed an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Pacific countries. When Scott Morrison arrived on Wednesday afternoon, he was asked by Sopoaga, as all leaders were, to stop and consider the installation built at the entry to the airport \u2013 a model of an island in distress with a moat around it, in which young children sat. Groups of children sang a welcome song: \u201cWe have a problem, we need to solve it, we need to start right now.\u201d Before singing a version of Sopoaga\u2019s famous statement on climate change: \u201cSave Tuvalu to save the world.\u201d Morrison\u2019s announcement of $500m in climate resilience and adaptation for the Pacific region on Monday night, while welcomed by Pacific leaders, did not buy Australia much of a reprieve. The next day, Sopoaga said: \u201cNo matter how much money you put on the table, it doesn\u2019t give you the excuse to not to do the right thing, which is to cut down on your emissions, including not opening your coalmines.\u201d The main event of the week, the leaders\u2019 retreat, was held on Thursday, with leaders, in the customary matching shirts, sitting down to thrash out the language of a forum communique and climate change statement, that will be used as the basis of regional decision-making. At dawn on the morning of the retreat, as he stood watching an early-morning demonstration of traditional Tuvaluan fishing methods, Sopoaga said he was optimistic and thought negotiations would be wrapped up by lunchtime. Sopoaga said the fishing method was a good metaphor for what the leaders were trying to do that day: a group of people walk out into the water and advance in a line, slapping and waving palm branches underwater, to frighten the fish which are herded toward the reef and then eventually surrounded by the group who hold hands and advance, trapping them with their bodies before they are scooped up with nets. \u201cYou go in unison, you go like a human net. It\u2019s a community thing, it\u2019s a collective. I think that\u2019s the way to address climate change. We must base it on a community approach,\u201d Sopoaga said. But that community was sorely tested throughout Thursday, in a meeting between the leaders that Vanuatu\u2019s foreign minister described as \u201cfierce at times\u201d and almost broke down twice, due to Australia\u2019s refusal to budge on certain red lines, including insisting on the removal of mentions of coal, limiting warming to under 1.5C and setting a plan for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Sopoaga said the next day he had told Morrison at one point during discussions: \u201cYou are trying to save your economy, I am trying to save my people.\u201d Emotions ran high, with Sopoaga revealing that at one point during discussions, the Tongan prime minister, Akilisi Pohiva, cried as he reflected on a presentation given by two young women at the climate change summit earlier in the week about their fears for the future. Pohiva cut a dignified but heartrending figure throughout the week. He attended the summit despite serious health concerns, which he told the Guardian meant this year\u2019s PIF would likely be his last. His frailty was evident, but so too was his deep feeling for Tuvalu, with other leaders speaking of the enormous respect his presence, despite his illness, demonstrated for the region and its concerns. An exhausted Sopoaga eventually emerged from the retreat venue on Thursday night, after almost 12 hours of negotiations, and told the waiting press that an agreement had been reached on the forum communique and climate change statement. Australia had succeeded in watering down the language of the communique, and keeping out any mention of coal and its other \u201cred lines\u201d. But while Australia may have succeeded in softening the language, the means by which it achieved that victory seemed to undermine the government\u2019s much-touted Pacific step-up, in which Canberra seeks to engage more concertedly with the region, particularly in light of China\u2019s increasing interest in it. The Fijian prime minister expressed his anger with how events had unfolded in the leaders\u2019 retreat, telling the Guardian that Morrison had been \u201cvery insulting and condescending\u201d and that his behaviour could lead countries to reject Australia in favour of engagement with China. \u201cAfter what we went through with Morrison, nothing can be worse than him,\u201d Bainimarama said. As the accommodation was packed up and the Australian defence force Hercules planes took delegates away, the people of Tuvalu remained, facing the same threats and dangers they did before leaders came to debate what to do about them. On the final night of the forum, a clearly disappointed Sopoaga urged Tuvaluans who were unhappy with the \u201ccompromised\u201d language coming out of the event not to lose hope, and he urged the rest of the world to remember the plight of his people: \u201cWe ask, please understand this, our people are dying.\u201d",
